PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. CANDELARIO IBALANG ALIAS âTATA,â
ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


This is an
appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tagum, Davao, Branch 1,
finding the accused-appellant Candelario Ibalang, alias âTata,â guilty of rape
committed on June 23 and 24, 1990 against his stepdaughter, Leizel Morales, and
sentencing him to two (2) counts of 
reclusion perpetua 
with all the
accessory penalties of the law and to pay the offended party 
P
100,000 in
moral damages for the two crimes.


The facts are as
follows:


Accused-appellant Candelario
Ibalang is the second husband of Rosita Loyong.  Complainant Leizel Morales is Rositaâs daughter by her previous
marriage to Victor Morales (now deceased). Prior to the incident in question,
Leizel lived in the same house with accused-appellant in Araibo, Pantukan in
Davao del Norte.


Leizel Morales was examined at  the Provincial Hospital of Davao Oriental on
June 26, 1990, after she had allegedly been raped by accused-appellant and
found to have suffered the following injuries:

DIAGNOSIS
        
:  
          
HYMENAL LACERATION AT THE
7 OâCLOCK  POSITION


                                                     
:
            
HYPEREMIA
AT THE INNER SURFACE OF THE LABIA MINORA, RIGHT SIDE (ADJACENT TO THE
LACERATION)


On July 4, 1990, she gave a sworn
statement at the Pantukan Police Station, narrating how she had been raped by
her stepfather, Candelario Ibalang, on June 23 and 24, 1990 inside their house
in Araibo, Pantukan, Davao Del Norte.  The pertinent portions of her affidavit state:
[2]


04. Q.-
   
When and  where did this incident happen?


A.-
          
Last
June 23, 1990 at around 12:00 midnight inside our house in Araibo, Pantukan,
Davao and my said stepfather abused me again last June 24, 1990 at around 8:00
oâclock in the morning in the same place.  


05. Q.-
   
Will you please narrate in brief how the
incident happen? 


A.-
          
I
was awakened when my said stepfather suddenly pulled my shoulder then my said stepfather
placed himself on top of me which made me afraid and before I could shout due
to fear, my said stepfather was able to cover my mouth with his hand at that
juncture, he (stepfather) while on top of me pulled down and [took] off his
short pant[s] and brief and during that time, I noticed that my panty has been
taken off already and I fully believed that my said stepfather took off my
panty while I was sleeping.


06. Q.
    
What happened next if there was any?  


A.-
          
My
said stepfather h[e]ld his penis then pushed it on my vagina and he forced his
penis to insert inside my vagina several times which made me cry and requested
my said stepfather to stop due to great pain.  


07. Q.-
   
How did you request your stepfather to stop? 


A.-
          
I requested
him by saying, âAYAW PA, AYAW LAGI PA KAY SAKIT KAAYOâ, and at the same time I
pushed him away from me.


08. Q.-
   
What did your stepfather do when you
requested him to stop?  


A.-
          
Instead,
my said stepfather continued pushing his penis on my vagina until he succeeded
and inserted it inside my vagina then he pushed and pulled it several times and
later, I noticed something liquid [came] out from his penis then he stood up
and [wore] his brief[s] and short pant[s] and lied beside me and during that time,
I saw that my vagina is bleeding and still painful.  


09. Q.-
What happened more if there was any?  


A.-
          
On
June 24, 1990 at around 8:00 oâclock in the morning, while I was working in the
kitchen, my said stepfather called me inside the room and instructed me to look
for his short pant[s] which made me [obey] and [enter] inside the room but when
I was already inside the room my said stepfather embraced me then pulled down
and [took] off my panty which  made me
cry sensing his bad intention then I heard him [warn] me by saying, âAYAW
PAGSABA HAâ and at the same time pushed me to lie down on the floor and again
he succeeded in having sexual intercourse with me which is against my will, and
when my said stepfather was satisfied, he left our house and proceeded to our
farm uphill. 


Thereafter, two
(2) criminal cases for rape were filed against accused-appellant upon complaint
of Leizel Morales in the Regional Trial Court of Tagum, Davao.
[3]
 Accused-appellant Candelario
Ibalang pleaded not guilty to the charges.
[4]
 The two cases were then jointly
heard.


The prosecution
presented complainant Leizel Morales who testified that her father was already
dead and that, prior to the incident, she lived in the house of her stepfather
Candelario Ibalang along with her siblings and their mother Rosita.
[5]
 She told the court that on the
night of June 23, 1990, while she and her siblings were asleep and their mother
Rosita was in Lupon, accused-appellant Candelario Ibalang succeeded in raping
her by removing her panties and inserting his penis into her vagina.
[6]
 She tried to resist but
accused-appellant was stronger than she.  As a result, her vagina bled.
[7]


Leizel further
testified that the following morning, on June 24, 1990, accused-appellant asked
her other brothers and sisters to take a bath,
[8]
 and that while she was washing the
dishes, she was ordered by accused-appellant to get his short pants.
[9]
 As she was about to get the short
pants, accused-appellant grabbed her and embraced her.
[10]
 Leizel told him, âAyaw, Pa!â (âPa,
donâtâ), but accused-appellant did not heed her plea.  Instead he proceeded to remove her panties and made her lie down
on the floor.
[11]
 He then placed himself on top of
her and inserted his penis into her vagina.
[12]
 She resisted, at the same time
pleading, âPlease donât because it is painful.â
[13]
 But accused-appellant only ordered
her to keep quiet.
[14]


After that, she
went to her aunt Baby Morales and reported the incident.
[15]
 She was accompanied to the office
of the barangay captain and later to the house of her uncle Remegio Morales in
Lupon.
[16]
 Together the three proceeded to the
provincial hospital in Mati, where she was examined by a physician.
[17]


On
cross-examination, Leizel reiterated her claim that accused-appellant had raped
her on June 23 and 24, 1990.  She said
that she and her siblings had been sent to school by accused-appellant and that
prior to the incident, she did not notice any misconduct or misbehavior on the
part of her stepfather.
[18]


The
complainantâs testimony was corroborated in material points by the testimonies
of her uncle Remegio Morales
[19]
 and her aunt Floresfina
Morales-Toong.
[20]


Dr. Agnes
Quibod, the physician who examined Leizel Morales on June 26, 1990, testified
that Leizel Morales was accompanied by her aunt to the hospital;
[21]
 that she found a âhymenal laceration
at the 7 oâclock position and hyperemia at the inner surface of the labia
minora right side that is adjacent to the laceration;â
[22]
 and that the laceration was still
fresh and was about two to three days old.
[23]


On
cross-examination, Dr. Quibod said that Leizel had told her that she was twice
raped, first, on June 23, 1990, at 8 oâclock in the evening, and again, on June
24, 1990, at 12 oâclock midnight.
[24]
 Leizel told her that
accused-appellant had mashed her private part (âGihilabtan ang iyang puwertaâ)
and threatened her.
[25]


Accused-appellant,
on the other hand, denied the accusation and testified that on June 22, 1990,
Leizel Morales left their house after asking permission from her mother,
Rosita, to go to the house of her aunt, Baby Morales.
[26]
 He said that he first came to know
about the alleged rape only after he was arrested and  brought to the office of the barangay captain where he was
accused of the crime.
[27]
 He said he told his accusers that
he was not so depraved as to rape his stepdaughter and asked that the girl be
examined by a doctor.
[28]
 He said he did not know whether
Leizel was examined because his wife was not able to accompany his stepdaughter
to the doctor and he was not shown any medical certificate.
[29]
 He added that his wife did not want
to file the case against him because she knew that the accusation was false.
[30]


On
cross-examination, accused-appellant reiterated his testimony during the direct
examination and claimed that he and Rosita had been married according to the
rites of the Iglesia ni Kristo
[31]
 and that Leizel was not nine years
old, but eight years old.
[32]


The defense
intended to present Leizelâs mother, Rosita, as witness, but she left
accused-appellant during the trial.
[33]
 The defense presented instead accused-appellantâs
two âbrothers in faith,â Iglesia ni Kristo members Eduardo Ibarra and Juanito
Saren, who testified as to the good moral character of accused-appellant. 


Eduardo Ibarra
testified that he had been a resident of Araibo, Pantukan since 1975.
[34]
 He knew accused-appellant
Candelario Ibalang as well as  Rositaâs
former husband, Victor.  During their
marriage, Rosita and Victor acquired a Honda motorcycle and SSS benefits, which
after Victorâs death, were enjoyed by Rositaâs brothers and sisters.
[35]
 Ibarra said that accused-appellant
sent Rositaâs children by Victor to school.
[36]
 He claimed that he saw Leizel at
his childâs birthday party on June 24, 1990, and that earlier that day he also
saw complainant playing and running around the yard of a certain Neneng.
[37]
 Later in the afternoon, he heard
the news that Leizel had been molested.
[38]
 His âbrodâ Juanito Saren (also a
defense witness) told him that Leizel had been raped but the commander of the
detachment, a certain Commander Ochie, did not believe the report.
[39]
 He said that Leizel was taken by
her aunt to a doctor to be examined.
[40]
 He also claims that the former
âin-lawsâ of Rosita (relatives of Victor Morales) were against Rositaâs
relationship with accused-appellant.
[41]


On
cross-examination, Eduardo Ibarra said that he last saw Leizel playing in the
yard of Neneng on June 24, 1990.
[42]
 He also said that it was public
knowledge that Leizel had been raped and that she had gone to the doctor to be
examined and to the military detachment to report the matter.
[43]


The last witness
for the defense, Juanito Saren, testified that Rosita Loyong (mother of Leizel)
is accused-appellantâs second wife and that her âin-lawsâ were against her
relationship with accused-appellant.
[44]
 He claimed that he saw Leizel on
June 23, 1990 at the house of Neneng, where Leizelâs stepcousin worked as
househelper.
[45]
 He further claimed that he saw
Leizel in the afternoon of the same day with a friend, a certain Evangeline.
[46]
 He was surprised to hear that
accused-appellant Candelario Ibalang was guilty of rape.  He went to the office of the barangay
captain, where he saw accused-appellant, the girl Leizel, Baby Morales and the
latterâs husband.
[47]
 He said that accused-appellant was
arrested by the Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) on June 24, 1990
and taken to the office of the barangay captain, where accused-appellant
learned about the rape charge against him.
[48]
 As head of their church, he was
asked by the barangay captain to talk to accused-appellant to find out why he
committed the crime but accused-appellant denied complainantâs accusations.
[49]
 He said the barangay captain
referred the matter to the âbankersâ (office of the military detachment), where
accused-appellant was taken by two CAFGU soldiers.
[50]
 This witness added that Rosita
Loyong was not present during the confrontation because she was in Lupon and
only came to know what happened after she went to see accused-appellant in the
âbankers.â
[51]
 After that, Rosita went home to
have Leizel examined by a doctor.
[52]
 He said that Rosita did not go with
Leizel because she was told by Baby Morales to look for money.
[53]
 He also said that Rositaâs former
âin-lawsâ (relatives of Victor Morales) were angry at Rosita for marrying
accused-appellant, because they wanted her to marry a relative of Victor so that
the motorcycle, SSS benefits and other properties which she and Victor had
acquired during their marriage would not be enjoyed by strangers.
[54]
 But, he said, that
accused-appellant sent Rositaâs children to school and loved them and even
protected them from Rosita.
[55]
 He likewise claims that
accused-appellant had a strong religious faith and was never absent from church
services except when he was sick.
[56]


On November 5,
1992, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused-appellant Candelario
Ibalang guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and  sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua
 (two counts) and to pay Leizel Morales 
P
100,000 moral
damages for the two crimes of rape.
[57]


Hence, this
appeal.  Accused-appellant contends:
[58]


I


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF
COMPLAINANT LEIZEL MORALES THAT SHE WAS RAPED BY HER STEPFATHER DESPITE THE
FACT THAT HER TESTIMONY IS TAINTED WITH DOUBTS AND IMPROBABILITIES. 


II


THE TRIAL COURT
ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT ON GROUND OF REASONABLE DOUBT.


The appeal has
no merit.  Rape committed by someone
whom the victim has trusted is a heinous crime, both detestable and shockingly
evil.  After reviewing the evidence, we
are convinced that the prosecution in this case has satisfactorily overcome the
presumption of innocence accorded to every accused and that accused-appellant
is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.


First. 
Accused-appellant claims that Leizel
Moralesâ testimony is tainted with contradictions and improbabilities pointing
out the following apparent inconsistencies:
[59]


(1) Leizel testified that she was
raped in the evening of June 23, 1990 and in the morning of June 24, 1990, but
Dr. Agnes Quibod testified that Leizel told her that she had been raped at 8 in
the evening of June 23, 1990 and at 12 in the evening of June 24, 1990; and


(2)  Leizel testified in court that her mother was in Lupon when she
was raped, while in her affidavit, she stated that her mother was in Mati at
the time. 


Accused-appellant
also argues that it is improbable and contrary to human nature and experience:
[60]


(1)  that he would rape private complainant after telling his other
children to take a bath; and


(2) that he would be able to do the
âpush and pull motionâ several times after forcing his penis into the vagina of
complainant, considering that the latter is a virgin and a child of tender
years.


Complainantâs
testimony is clear, candid, straightforward and consistent.  She recounted both in her affidavit and her
testimony in court how she was raped by accused-appellant on June 23 and 24,
1990.  She was consistent in stating
that she was raped by her stepfather inside their house in Araibo, Pantukan in
the evening of June 23, 1990, while she was sleeping with her siblings, and
again raped the following morning on June 24, 1990 after she was asked by said
accused-appellant to bring him his short pants and while her other siblings
were taking a bath.  


While Dr. Quibod
said she had been told by complainant that she was raped a second time in the
evening on June 24, 1990, it is entirely possible that Dr. Quibod either did
not understand or forgot what complainant had told her was the time complainant
had been raped on June 24, 1990.  What
is important is that complainant was consistent both in her affidavit and in
her testimony in court.  On the other
hand, the inconsistency between what complainant said in her affidavit as where
her mother was at the time of the incident (in Mati) and what she said in court
(she was in Lupon) concerns a minor matter which does not affect her
credibility.  The rule on this point was
restated with cogency by Justice Ricardo Francisco in his opinion for the
court, as follows:
[61]


[W]ell settled is the rule
that inconsistencies and contradictions which are minor, trivial and
inconsequential cannot impair, and on the contrary, serve to strengthen the
credibility of the witness.  They are
badges of truth rather than indicia of falsehood.  In addition, whenever an inconsistency exists between a statement
in the affidavit of a witness and her testimony in open court, the latter
commands greater weight.  Therefore,
discrepancies between statements of the affiant in her affidavit and those made
by her on the witness stand do not necessarily discredit her.


Nor is there
merit in accused-appellantâs last two contentions.  This is not the first time that a child under twelve years of age
was raped inside the house where there were other people at the time.  As we have said many times already, lust can
be no respecter of either time or place.
[62]
 Nor was it unnatural for
accused-appellant to send Leizelâs siblings away, the better for him to
consummate his foul deed.


Nor, finally,
was it impossible for accused-appellant to have done the âpush and pull
motion.â  That was the reason Leizel
suffered lacerations in her hymen and injuries to her vagina which caused it to
bleed.  In truth this is not the first
time that a child of tender years has been raped in such manner.  In a recent case, 
People v. Butron
,
[63]
 the Court found accused to have
twice inserted his finger and then later his organ into the vagina of an
eight-year old girl.


Second.
  As we have said, the testimonies of rape victims who are young and of tender
age are credible, especially if they are without any motive to testify falsely
against the accused.
[64]
 In the case at bar, no motive has
been shown why complainant should testify falsely against her stepfather, who
sent her and all her other siblings to school.  Even if her aunt Baby Morales and uncle Remegio Morales did not like
accused-appellant, that fact alone would not be sufficient to make
complainantâs testimony suspect.  No
blood relative, whether aunt or uncle, could possibly be so foolish as to
expose his niece to public disgrace just to spite someone they do not like for
their âin-law.â  The fact is that Leizel
was raped.  The medical examination
confirmed this.  If it was not
accused-appellant who did it, then who?  It is inconceivable for a child of tender years to falsely accuse her
stepfather, whom she called âPapaâ and on whom she depended for support, of
such a grievous offense.

 the decision of the trial court is
