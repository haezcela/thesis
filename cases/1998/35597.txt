PANGANIBAN, J.:


What is the
nature of a bill of lading?  When does a
bill of lading  become binding on a
consignee?  Will an alleged overshipment
justify the consigneeâs refusal to receive the goods described in the bill of
lading? When may interest be computed on unpaid demurrage charges?


Statement of the Case


These are the
main questions raised in this petition assailing the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 promulgated on May 20, 1994 in
C.A.-G.R. CV No. 29953 affirming 
in toto 
the decision
[3]
 dated September 28, 1990 in Civil
Case No. 85-33269 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 21.  The dispositive portion of the said RTC
decision reads:


âWHEREFORE, the Court finds
by preponderance of evidence that Plaintiff has proved its cause of action and
right to relief.  Accordingly, judgment
is hereby rendered in favor of the Plaintiff and against Defendant, ordering
the Defendant to pay plaintiff:


1.
             
The
sum of 
P
67,340.00 as demurrage charges, with interest at the legal rate
from the date of the extrajudicial demand until fully paid;


2.
             
A
sum equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the total amount due as Attorneyâs fees
and litigation expenses.


Send copy to respective counsel of
the parties.


SO ORDERED.â
[4]


The Facts


The factual
antecedents of this case as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:


âPlaintiff (herein private
respondent), a shipping company, is a foreign corporation licensed to do
business in the Philippines.  On June
29, 1982, plaintiff received at its Hong Kong terminal a sealed container,
Container No. SEAU 67523, containing seventy-six bales of âunsorted waste
paperâ for shipment to defendant (herein petitioner), Keng Hua Paper Products,
Co. in Manila.  A bill of lading (Exh.
A) to cover the shipment was issued by the plaintiff.


On July 9, 1982, the
shipment was discharged at the Manila International Container Port.  Notices of arrival were transmitted to the
defendant but the latter failed to discharge the shipment from the container
during the âfree timeâ period or grace period.  The said shipment remained inside the plaintiffâs container from the
moment the free time period expired on July 29, 1982 until the time when the
shipment was unloaded from the container on November 22, 1983, or a total of
four hundred eighty-one (481) days.  During the 481-day period, demurrage charges accrued.  Within the same period, letters demanding
payment were sent by the plaintiff to the defendant who, however, refused to
settle its obligation which eventually amounted to P67,340.00.  Numerous demands were made on the defendant
but the obligation remained unpaid.  Plaintiff thereafter commenced this civil action for collection and
damages.


In its answer, defendant,
by way of special and affirmative defense, alleged that it purchased fifty (50)
tons of waste paper from the shipper in Hong Kong,  Ho Kee Waste Paper, as manifested in Letter of Credit No. 824858
(Exh. 7. p. 110.  Original Record)
issued by Equitable Banking Corporation, with partial shipment permitted; that
under the  letter of credit, the
remaining balance of the shipment was only ten (10) metric tons as shown in
Invoice No. H-15/82 (Exh. 8, p. 111, Original Record); that the shipment
plaintiff was asking defendant to accept was twenty (20) metric tons which is
ten (10) metric tons more than the remaining balance; that if defendant were to
accept the shipment, it would be violating Central Bank rules and regulations
and custom and tariff laws; that plaintiff had no cause of action against the
defendant because the latter did not hire the former to carry the merchandise;
that the cause of action should be against the shipper which contracted the
plaintiffâs services and not against defendant; and that the defendant duly
notified the plaintiff about the wrong shipment through a letter dated January
24, 1983 (Exh. D for plaintiff, Exh. 4 for defendant, p. 5.  Folder of Exhibits).â


As previously
mentioned, the RTC found petitioner liable for demurrage, attorneyâs fees and
expenses of litigation.  The petitioner
appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing that the lower court erred in  (1) awarding the sum of 
P
67,340 in
favor of  the  private respondent,  (2)
rejecting petitionerâs contention that there was overshipment,  (3) ruling that petitionerâs recourse was
against the shipper,  and  (4)  computing legal interest from date of extrajudicial demand.
[5]


Respondent Court
of Appeals denied the appeal and affirmed the lower courtâs decision 
in toto
.  In a subsequent resolution,
[6]
 it also denied the petitionerâs
motion for reconsideration. 


Hence, this
petition for review.
[7]


The Issues


In its
memorandum, petitioner submits the following issues:


âI.
        
Whether
or not petitioner had accepted the bill of lading;


II.
        
Whether
or not the award of the sum of P67,340.00 to private respondent was proper;


III.
       
Whether or not petitioner was correct in not accepting the
overshipment;


IV.
      
Whether or not the award of legal interest
from the date of private respondentâs extrajudicial demand was proper;â
[8]


In the
main,  the case revolves around the question
of whether petitioner was bound by the bill of lading.  We shall, thus, discuss the above four
issues as they intertwine with this main question.


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
partly meritorious.  We affirm
petitionerâs liability for demurrage, but modify the interest rate thereon.


Main Issue: 
  Liability Under the Bill of Lading


A bill of lading
serves two functions.  
First
, it
is a receipt for the goods shipped. 
  Second
, it is a contract by which three parties, namely, the
shipper, the carrier, and the consignee undertake specific responsibilities and
assume stipulated obligations.
[9]
 A âbill of lading delivered and
accepted constitutes the contract of carriage even though not signed,â
[10]
 because the â(a)cceptance of a
paper  containing  the  terms  of  a proposed contract generally constitutes an
acceptance of the contract and of all of its terms and conditions of which the
acceptor has actual or constructive notice.â
[11]
 In a nutshell, the acceptance of a
bill of lading by the shipper and the consignee, with full knowledge of its
contents, gives rise to the presumption that the same was a perfected and
binding contract.
[12]


In the case at
bar, both lower courts held that the bill of lading was a valid and perfected
contract between the shipper (Ho Kee), the consignee (Petitioner Keng Hua), and
the carrier (Private Respondent Sea-Land).  Section 17 of the bill of lading provided that the shipper and the
consignee were liable for the payment of demurrage charges for the failure to
discharge the containerized shipment beyond the grace period allowed by tariff
rules.  Applying said stipulation, both
lower courts found petitioner liable.  The aforementioned section of the bill of lading reads:


â17.  COOPERAGE FINES.  
The shipper and consignee shall be liable for, indemnify the
carrier and ship and hold them harmless against,
 and the carrier shall have
a lien on the goods for, all expenses and charges for mending cooperage,
baling, repairing or reconditioning the goods, or the van, trailers or
containers, and all expenses incurred in protecting, caring for or otherwise
made for the benefit of the goods, whether the goods be damaged or not, and for
any payment, expense, penalty fine, dues, duty, tax or impost, loss, damage,
detention, 
demurrage
, or liability of whatsoever nature, sustained or
incurred by or levied upon the carrier or the ship in connection with the goods
or by reason of the goods being or having been on board, or because of
shipperâs failure to procure consular or other proper permits, certificates or
any papers that may be required at any port or place or shipperâs failure to
supply information or otherwise to comply with all laws, regulations and
requirements of law in connection with the goods of from any other act or
omission of the shipper or consignee:â  (Underscoring supplied.)


Petitioner
contends, however, that it should not be bound by the bill of lading because it
never gave its consent thereto.  Although petitioner admits âphysical acceptanceâ of the bill of lading,
it argues that its subsequent actions belie the finding that it accepted the
terms and conditions printed therein.
[13]
 Petitioner cites as support the
âNotice of Refused or On Hand Freightâ it received on November 2, 1982 from
private respondent, which acknowledged that petitioner declined to accept the
shipment.  Petitioner adds that it sent
a copy of the said notice to the shipper on December 29, 1982.  Petitioner points to its January 24, 1983
letter to the private respondent, stressing âthat its acceptance of the bill of
lading would be tantamount to an act of smuggling as the amount it had imported
(with full documentary support) was only (at that time) for 10,000 kilograms
and not for 20,313 kilograms as stated in the bill of ladingâ and âcould lay
them vulnerable to legal sanctions for violation of customs and tariff as well
as Central Bank laws.â
[14]
 Petitioner further argues that the
demurrage âwas a consequence of the shipperâs mistakeâ of shipping more than
what was bought.  The discrepancy in the
amount of waste paper it actually purchased, as reflected in the invoice 
vis-Ã -vis

the excess amount in the bill of lading, allegedly justifies its refusal to
accept the shipment.
[15]


Petitioner Bound by the Bill of Lading


We are not
persuaded.  Petitioner admits that it
âreceived the bill of lading immediately after the arrival of the shipmentâ
[16]
 on July 8, 1982.
[17]
 Having been afforded an opportunity
to examine the said document, petitioner did not immediately object to or
dissent from any term or stipulation therein.  It was only six months later, on January 24, 1983, that petitioner sent
a letter to private respondent saying that it could not accept the
shipment.  Petitionerâs inaction for
such a long period conveys the clear inference that it accepted the terms and
conditions of the bill of lading.  Moreover, said letter spoke only of petitionerâs inability to use the
delivery permit,
 i.e.
 to pick up the cargo, due to the shipperâs failure
to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit,  for which reason the bill of lading and
other shipping documents were returned by the âbanksâ to the shipper.
[18]
 The letter merely proved
petitionerâs refusal to pick up the cargo, not its rejection of the bill of
lading.


Petitionerâs
reliance on the Notice of Refused or On Hand Freight, as proof of its
nonacceptance of the bill of lading, is of no consequence.  Said notice was not written by petitioner;
it was sent by private respondent to petitioner in November 1982, or four
months after petitioner received the bill of lading.  If  the  notice  has  any  legal  significance at  all,  it  is to highlight petitionerâs prolonged failure to object to the bill of
lading.  Contrary to petitionerâs
contention,  the notice and the letter
support â not belie â the findings of the two lower courts that the bill of
lading was impliedly accepted by petitioner.


As aptly stated
by Respondent Court of Appeals:


âIn the instant case,
(herein petitioner) cannot and did not allege non-receipt of its copy of the
bill of lading from the shipper.  Hence,
the terms and conditions as well as the various entries contained therein were
brought to its knowledge.  (Herein
petitioner) accepted the bill of lading without interposing any objection as to
its contents.  This raises the
presumption that (herein petitioner) agreed to the entries and stipulations
imposed therein.


Moreover, it is puzzling
that (herein petitioner) allowed months to pass, six (6) months to be exact,
before notifying (herein private respondent) of the âwrong shipment.â  It was only on January 24, 1983 that (herein
petitioner) sent (herein private respondent) such a letter of notification (Exh
D for plaintiff, Exh. 4 for defendant; p. 5, Folder of Exhibits).  Thus, for the duration of those six months
(herein private respondent never knew the reason for (herein petitionerâs)
refusal to discharge the shipment.


After
accepting the bill of lading, receiving notices of arrival of the shipment,
failing to object thereto, (herein petitioner) cannot now deny that it is bound
by the terms in the bill of lading.  If
it did not intend to be bound, (herein petitioner) would not have waited for
six months to lapse before finally bringing the matter to (herein private
respondentâs attention.  The most
logical reaction in such a case would be to immediately verify the matter with
the other parties involved.  In this
case, however, (herein petitioner) unreasonably detained (herein private
respondentâs) vessel to the latterâs prejudice.â
[19]


Petitionerâs attempt to
evade its obligation to receive the shipment on the pretext that this may cause
it to violate customs, tariff and central bank laws must likewise fail.  Mere apprehension of violating said laws,
without a clear demonstration that taking delivery of the shipment has become
legally impossible,
[20]
 cannot defeat the petitionerâs contractual
obligation and liability under the bill of lading.


In any event,
the issue of whether petitioner accepted the bill of lading was raised for the
first time only in petitionerâs memorandum before this Court.  Clearly, we cannot now entertain an issue
raised for the very first time on appeal, in deference to the well-settled
doctrine that â(a)n issue raised for the first time on appeal and not raised
timely in the proceedings in the lower court is barred by estoppel.  Questions raised on appeal must be within
the issues framed by the parties and, consequently, issues not raised in the
trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.â
[21]


In the case at
bar, the prolonged failure of petitioner to receive and discharge the cargo
from the private respondentâs vessel constitutes a violation of the terms of
the bill of lading.  It should thus be
liable for demurrage to the former.


In 
The
Apollon,
[22]
 
Justice Story made the following relevant comment on
the nature of demurrage:


âIn truth, demurrage is
merely an allowance or compensation for the delay or detention of a
vessel.  It is often a matter of
contract, but not necessarily so.  The
very circumstance that in ordinary commercial voyages, a particular sum is
deemed by the parties a fair compensation for delays, is the very reason why it
is, and ought to be, adopted as a measure of compensation, in cases ex
delicto.  What fairer rule can be
adopted than that which founds itself upon mercantile usage as to indemnity,
and fixes a recompense upon the deliberate consideration of all the
circumstances attending the usual earnings and expenditures in common
voyages?  It appears to us that an
allowance, by way of demurrage, is the true measure of damages in all cases of
mere detention, for that allowance has reference to the shipâs expenses, wear
and tear, and common employment.â
[23]


Amount of
Demurrage Charges


Petitioner
argues that it is not obligated to pay any demurrage charges because, prior to
the filing of the complaint, private respondent made no demand for the sum of 
P
67,340.  Moreover, private respondentâs loss and
prevention manager, Loi Gillera, demanded 
P
50,260, but its counsel,
Sofronio Larcia, subsequently asked for a different amount of 
P
37,800.


Petitionerâs
position is puerile.  The amount of
demurrage charges in the sum of 
P
67,340 is a factual conclusion of the
trial court that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and, thus, binding on
this Court.
[24]
 Besides such factual finding is
supported by the extant evidence.
[25]
 The apparent discrepancy was a
result of the variance of the dates when the two demands were made.  Necessarily, the longer the cargo remained
unclaimed, the higher the demurrage.  Thus, while in his letter dated April 24, 1983,
[26]
 private respondentâs counsel demanded
payment of only 
P
37,800, the additional demurrage incurred by petitioner
due to its continued refusal to receive delivery of the cargo ballooned to 
P
67,340
by November 22, 1983.  The testimony of
Counsel Sofronio Larcia as regards said letter of April 24, 1983 elucidates, 
viz
:


âQ
    
Now,
after you sent this letter, do you know what happened?


A
     
Defendant
continued to refuse to take delivery of the shipment and the shipment stayed at
the port for a longer period.


Q
     
So,
what happened to the shipment?


A
     
The
shipment incurred additional demurrage charges which amounted to 
P
67,340.00
as of November 22, 1983 or more than a year after - almost a year after the
shipment arrived at the port.


Q
     
So,
what did you do?


A
     
We requested our collection agency to
pursue the collection of this amount.â
[27]


Bill of Lading Separate from


Other Letter of Credit Arrangement
s


In a letter of
credit, there are three distinct and independent contracts:  (1)  the contract of sale between the buyer and the seller,  (2)  the contract of the buyer with the issuing bank, and  (3) the letter of credit proper in which the
bank promises to pay the seller pursuant to the terms and conditions stated
therein.  âFew things are more clearly
settled in law than that the three contracts which make up the letter of credit
arrangement are to be maintained in a state of perpetual separation.â
[28]
 A transaction involving the
purchase of goods may also require, apart from a letter of credit, a contract
of transportation specially when the seller and the buyer are not in the same
locale or country, and the goods purchased have to be transported to the
latter.  


Hence, the
contract of carriage, as stipulated in the bill of lading in the present case,
must be treated independently of the contract of sale between the seller and
the buyer, and the contract for the issuance of a letter of credit between the
buyer and the issuing bank.  Any
discrepancy between the amount of the goods described in the commercial invoice
in the contract of sale and the amount allowed in the letter of credit will not
affect the validity and enforceability of the contract of carriage as embodied
in the bill of lading.  As the bank
cannot be expected to look beyond the documents presented to it by the seller
pursuant to the letter of credit,
[29]
 neither can the carrier be expected
to go beyond the representations of the shipper in the bill of lading and to
verify their accuracy 
vis-Ã -vis 
the commercial invoice and the letter of
credit.  Thus, the discrepancy between
the amount of goods indicated in the invoice and the amount  in  the  bill  of  lading cannot negate petitionerâs obligation to private respondent
arising from the contract of transportation.  Furthermore, private respondent, as carrier, had no knowledge of the
contents of the container.  The contract
of carriage was under the arrangement known as âShipperâs Load And Count,â  and the shipper was solely responsible for
the loading of the container while the carrier was oblivious to the contents of
the shipment.  Petitionerâs remedy in
case of overshipment lies against the seller/shipper, not against the carrier.


Payment of
Interest 


Petitioner
posits that it âfirst knewâ of the demurrage claim of 
P
67,340 only when
it received, by summons, private respondentâs complaint.  Hence, interest may not be allowed to run
from the date of private respondentâs extrajudicial demands on March 8, 1983
for 
P
50,260 or on April 24, 1983 for 
P
37,800, considering that,
in both cases, âthere was no demand for interest.â
[30]
 We agree.


Jurisprudence
teaches us:


â2. When an obligation, 
not
constituting a loan or forbearance of money
, is breached, an interest on
the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the 
discretion
 of the
court at the rate of 6% 
per annum
.  No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or
damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable
certainty.  Accordingly, 
where the
demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to
run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially
 (Art.
1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established
at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the
date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of
damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).  
The actual base for the computation of
legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged
.


3.  When the judgment of the court awarding a
sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether
the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum
from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to
be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.â
[31]


The case before
us involves an obligation not arising from a loan or forbearance of money;
thus, pursuant to Article 2209 of the Civil Code, the applicable interest rate
is six percent per annum.  Since the
bill of lading did not specify the amount of demurrage, and the sum claimed by
private respondent increased as the days went by, the total amount demanded
cannot be deemed to have been established with reasonable certainty until the
trial court rendered its judgment.  Indeed, â(u)nliquidated damages or claims, it is said, are those which
are not or cannot be known until definitely ascertained, assessed and
determined by the courts after presentation of proof.â
[32]
 Consequently, the legal interest
rate is six percent, to be computed from September 28, 1990, the date of the
trial courtâs decision.  And in
accordance with 
Philippine Natonal Bank
[33]
 
and 
Eastern Shipping,
[34]
 
the rate of twelve percent per annum shall be charged
on the total then outstanding, from the time the judgment becomes final and
executory until its satisfaction.


Finally, the
Court notes that the matter of attorneyâs fees was taken up only in the
dispositive portion of the trial courtâs decision.  This falls short of the settled requirement that the text of the
decision should state the reason for the award of attorneyâs fees, for without
such justification, its award would be a âconclusion without a premise, its
basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture.â
[35]


WHEREFORE
, the assailed Decision is hereby 
AFFIRMED

with the 
MODIFICATION 
that the legal interest of six percent per
annum shall be computed from September 28, 1990 until its full payment before
finality of judgment.  The rate of
interest shall be adjusted to twelve percent per annum, computed from the time
said judgment became final and executory until full satisfaction.  The award of attorneyâs fees is 
DELETED
