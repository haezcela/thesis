D E C I S I O N




DAVIDE, JR., J.:


The petitioners
urge us in this special civil action for 
certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
to set aside the 23 September 1997 Resolution
[2]
 
of public respondent Commission on
Elections (hereafter COMELEC) in SPR No. 14-96,
[3]
 
which denied herein petitionersâ
petition for 
certiorari
 and prohibition to set aside and annul the order
of Branch 29 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pagadian City in Election
Protest Cases Nos. 07-95 to 12-95, inclusive, granting execution pending appeal
of the judgment therein.  


The petitioners
and the private respondents were the official candidates of the Nationalist
Peopleâs Coalition (NPC) and the Lakas-NUCD, respectively, for the elective
municipal positions of Guipos, Zamboanga del Sur, in the elections of 8 May
1995.  After the canvass of the election
returns, the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Guipos declared and proclaimed
the petitioners as the duly elected municipal officials, to wit:


Petitioner Roberto D. Ramas  --  as Mayor


Petitioner Francisco N. Oraiz  --  as Vice Mayor


Petitioner Benerando F.
Miranda  --  as fifth Member of the Sangguniang Bayan (SB)


Petitioner George V. Baterna  --  as sixth Member of the SB


Petitioner Tomas R. Lacierda  --  as seventh Member of the SB


Petitioner Pedro T. Calimot,
Jr.  --  as eighth Member of the SB


Private
respondents Raul F. Famor and Ponciano P. Cajeta, the losing candidates for
mayor and vice mayor, respectively, as well as Merlyn U. Rabe, Crescencia C.
Boiser, Edgar S. Revelo, and Julieto B. Mabascog, the 9
th
, 10
th
, 11
th
, and 12
th
 placers, respectively, for members
of the SB, seasonably filed separate election protests with the RTC of Pagadian
City.  The cases were docketed as
Election Protest Cases Nos. 07-95, 08-95, 09-95, 10-95, 11-95, and 12-95 and
thereafter consolidated and jointly tried.


On 16 May 1996,
the trial court rendered a 103-page decision
[4]
 declaring petitioner Miranda and
all the private respondents except Mabascog as winners in the 8 May 1995
elections.  The dispositive portion
thereof reads as follows:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby
rendered declaring:


1.
             
For
Mayor, RAUL F. FAMOR, as winner with the margin of Two hundred Ninety Eight
(298) votes over protestee Roberto Ramas, and as a consequence, the
proclamation and oath taking of Protestee Roberto Ramas as Municipal Mayor of Guipos,
Zamboanga del Sur, as null and void and of no force and effect;


2.
             
For
Vice-Mayor, PONCIANO CAJETA, as winner, with a majority of Three Hundred Forty
One (341) votes over that of protestee Francisco Oraiz, Jr., and as a
consequence, his proclamation as Vice-Mayor of Guipos, Zamboanga del Sur, as
null and void and of no force and effect;


3.
             
For
Members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Guipos, Zamboanga del Sur, the following
are declared duly qualified and elected, as follows:


3.a  Merlyn U. Rabe with 2,403 votes garnered;


3.b  Benerando Miranda with 2,361 votes garnered;


3.c  Edgar Revelo with 2,249 votes garnered;


3.d  Cresencia C. Boiser with 2,238 votes garnered;


and as a
consequence, the proclamation and taking of oath of George Baterna, Tomas Lacierda,
Sr., and Pedro Calimot, Jr., are declared null and void and of no force and
effect.


With cost 
de officio
.


SO ORDERED.  


On 22 May 1996,
private respondents Famor, Cajeta, Rabe, Revelo, and Boiser filed a Motion for
Immediate Execution of Decision Pending Appeal
[5]
 alleging as follows:


2.
       
That
pursuant to Section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, and the Supreme Court
ruling in the case of Tomas Tobon Uy vs. COMELEC and Jose C. Neyre, G.R. No.
97108-09, March 4, 1992, and Daniel Garcia & Teodoro Oâhara vs. Ernesto De
Jesus & Cecilia David & Comelec, G.R. No. 88158, March 4, 1992 (SCRA
Vol. 206, pages 779-801), Regional Trial Courts can order execution pending
appeal.


3.
       
That
there are good reasons in granting the execution of the decision pending appeal;
firstly, the appeal is merely dilatory, and it takes several years to terminate
the appeal; that in most cases, the term of office will already expire before
the appeal is finally decided.  To
construe otherwise would be to bring back the ghost of the âgrab-the-proclamation-prolong-the-protestâ
techniques so often resorted to by devious politicians in the past in their
efforts to perpetuate their hold to an elective office.  This would, as a consequence, lay to waste
the will of the electorate.  (See Estrada
vs. Sto. Domingo, G.R. No. L-30570, 29 July 1969; Lagumbay vs. Comelec, G.R.
No. L-25444, 31 January 1966, 16 SCRA 175); secondly, on the ground of 
public
interest
.  It must be noted that the
term of office of the contested positions is nearing expirations, hence, there
is a need, then, for this joint decision to be immediately executory.  (See Tomas Tobon Uy vs. Commission on
Elections & Jose C. Neyra, 206 SCRA 779, G.R. No. L-97108-09, March 4,
1992)


4.
       
That
protestants [are] willing to put up bond in the amount of 
P
500,000.00,
to answer for any damages protestees may suffer in the event protestants [are]
not entitled to the immediate execution.


On 28 May 1996,
the petitioners filed their Opposition to the Motion for Immediate Execution of
the Consolidated Decision.
[6]
 On that same day, they filed their
respective Notices of Appeal.
[7]


The next day, or
on 29 May 1996, the trial court issued an order
[8]
 granting the motion for execution
pending appeal.  The order reads as
follows:


Acting upon the Motion for
Execution of the decision pending appeal with the opposition thereto, the Court
finds the Motion to be well taken and there being a good reason to grant the
same, taking into consideration this involves the public interest and the near
expiration of the term of office of two (2) years and the pendency of the
protest which lasted for one (1) year.


WHEREFORE, the Motion is granted,
let a writ of execution be issued to enforce the decision of the Court pending
appeal for the reason aforecited.


SO ORDERED. 


On even date, a
Writ of Execution
[9]
 was issued.  Petitionersâ urgent motion to reconsider the
order of execution was denied.
[10]


On 4 June 1996,
the petitioners assailed the trial courtâs order granting execution pending
appeal in a Petition for 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition with Prayer for
Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order
[11]
 filed with the COMELEC.  The case was docketed as SPR
[12]
 No. 14-96.


On 6 June 1996,
the COMELEC issued an Order
[13]
 requiring the respondents to answer
the petition within ten days; setting for hearing the application for a writ of
preliminary injunction on 2 July 1996; and ordering the issuance of a temporary
restraining order directing private respondents  Famor, Cajeta, Rabe, Boiser, and Revelo to cease and desist from
assuming the positions of mayor, vice mayor, and councilors of Guipos,
Zamboanga del Sur, respectively, until further orders from the Commission. A
Temporary Restraining Order
[14]
 was forthwith issued.


Thereafter, on
various dates, the following were filed by the parties before the COMELEC:  a) private respondentsâ Motion to
Dissolve/Recall Temporary Restraining Order,
[15]
 b) petitionersâ Opposition to the
Motion to Dissolve/Recall Temporary Restraining Order,
[16]
 c) petitionersâ Urgent Motion to
Cite Private Respondents for Contempt.
[17]
 The above motions were heard by the
COMELEC on 9 July 1996; after which the parties submitted their respective
memoranda.
[18]


On 23 September
1997, respondent COMELEC promulgated a Resolution
[19]
 denying the petition in SPR No.
14-96.  It ratiocinated thus:


The Court has find [
sic
]
public interest and the pendency of the protest for one (1) year sufficient to
grant execution pending appeal.  In
election cases, over and above the claims of the respective contestants is the
deep public interest involved, the need to imperatively determine the correct
expression of the will of the electorate.  So much so that laws governing election protest must be literally
interpreted to the end that the popular will expressed in the election of
public officers will not, by reason of purely technical objections, be
defeated. [Calabig vs. Villanueva, 135 SCRA 300].  Our earlier pronouncements in âDictado vs. Cosico, SPR No. 2-93,
July 29, 1993 and Aragdon vs. Balongo, et al., SPR No. 56-96, January 7, 1997,â
may provide some enlightenment.  We
held:


âFor while it is true that when an
election protest is filed the protestee is only considered a presumptive winner
until the protest is resolved in the same way, when protestant is adjudged the
winner by a court of law but the case is on appeal with Commission, such appeal
likewise makes the protestant a presumptive winnerâ¦.â


Under the said 
Dictado
 and 
Aragdon

doctrines, private respondents can be adjudged presumptive winners of the
contested election, during the pendency of the appeal.  The proclamation rendered by the board of
canvassers suffices as basis for the right to assume, notwithstanding election
protest.  The proclaimed winners are
simply presumptive winners pending the resolution of  the election protest, and they still are able to assume
office.  A judgment favorable to the
protestant renders the latter presumptive winner, notwithstanding the appeal
therefrom.


It has already cost the private
respondents and the people of Guipos, Zamboanga del Sur, more than a year
before the protest was resolved in the lower court.  Depriving the private respondents the assumption of the duties
and functions ... will only resurrect the evils that the Court has long sought
to contain â the âgrab-the proclamation-prolong-the-protestâ technique.  [Cf Gahol vs. Riodique, 64 SCRA 494, Estrada
vs. Sto. Domingo, 28 SCRA 890, Lagumbay vs. COMELEC 16 SCRA 175]. 


We fail to find any abuse of
discretion, grave or otherwise.  In
fact, the position of the Honorable Judge granting execution pending appeal by
reason of public interest and more than a year pendency of the election protest
appears to be even justified by the Court, as it found in 
Garcia vs. De
Jesus
 [206 SCRA 779]:  âIn
retrospect, good reasons did in fact exist which justified the RTC Orderâ¦  granting execution pending appeal.  Among others mentioned by the RTC are the
combined considerations of the near expiration of the term of office, public
interest, the pendency of the election contest for more than 3 yearsâ¦.â


Unsatisfied with
the Resolution, the petitioners came to us via this petition wherein they
allege that


A
   
RESPONDENT COMMISSION SERIOUSLY
ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH A CASE OF GRAVE ABUSE OF
DISCRETION ON THE PART OF THE TRIAL COURT.


1.  The
questioned order itself of the trial court granting execution pending appeal
which cited insufficient reasons is proof of such grave abuse of discretion.


B
   
RESPONDENT COMMISSION ACTED
ARBITRARILY AND IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN, CONTRARY TO LAW AND THE
COMMISSIONâS OWN CASE PRECEDENTS, IT AFFIRMED AS GOOD REASONS NEAR EXPIRATION
OF THE TERM AND A YEAR PENDENCY OF THE PROTEST.


1.  The Dissenting Opinion enunciates the correct state of law on executions
pending appeal.


In the
resolution of 11 November 1997, we ordered the parties to maintain the 
status
quo
 prevailing at the time of the filing of the petition.


In its Comment
for public respondent COMELEC, the Office of the Solicitor General opines that
the trial court was evidently guided by the decisions of this Court in 
Garcia
v. De Jesus
[20]
 and 
Gahol v. Riodique
[21]
 
in holding that the combined grounds of (a) public
interest, (b) the near expiration of the term of office, and (c) the pendency
of the protest for one year constituted good reasons to grant private
respondentsâ  motion for execution
pending appeal.


In their
Comment, the private respondents maintain that the COMELEC acted in accordance
with law and existing jurisprudence in denying petitionersâ petition for 
certiorari

and prohibition. They also allege that the petitioners are even guilty of forum
shopping in filing the instant petition.


The Omnibus
Election Code of the Philippines (B.P. Blg. 881) and the other election laws
[22]
 do not specifically provide for
execution pending appeal of judgment in election cases, unlike the Election
Code of 1971 whose Section 218 made express reference to the Rules of Court on
execution pending appeal; thus:


SEC. 218.  
Assumption of office notwithstanding an election contest.
  -  Every candidate for a provincial, city, municipal or municipal district
office duly proclaimed elected by the corresponding board of canvassers shall
assume office, notwithstanding the pendency in the courts of any contest
against his election, without prejudice to the final decision thereon and
applicable provisions of the Rules of Court regarding execution of judgment
pending appeal. 


In 
Gahol v. Riodique
,
[23]
 
we explicitly ruled that the
assumption of office provided for in the aforementioned section âis that of the
protestant, which is made possible by the provisions of the Rules of Court
regarding execution pending appeal, which is none other than Section 2 of Rule
39.â


The failure of
the extant election laws to reproduce Section 218 of the Election Code of 1971
does not mean that execution of judgment pending appeal is no longer available
in election cases.  In election contests
involving elective municipal officials, which are cognizable by courts of
general jurisdiction; and those involving elective barangay officials, which are
cognizable by courts of limited jurisdiction,
[24]
 execution of judgment pending
appeal under Section 2 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court are permissible
pursuant to Rule 143 of the Rules of Court, which is now Section 4, Rule 1 of the
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.  This
Section 4 provides:


SEC. 4.  
In what cases not applicable.
  -- These Rules shall not apply to election cases, land
registration, cadastral, naturalization and insolvency proceedings, and other cases
not herein provided for, except by analogy or in a suppletory character and
whenever practicable and convenient. (R143a).


As to election
cases involving regional, provincial, and city officials, which fall within the
exclusive original jurisdiction of the COMELEC,
[25]
 Section 3 of Article IX-C of the
Constitution vests the COMELEC with the authority to promulgate its rules of
procedure in order to expedite disposition of election cases, including
pre-proclamation controversies.  Additionally, Section 52(c), Article VII of the Omnibus Election Code
empowers the COMELEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the
provisions of the Code or other laws which it is required to enforce and
administer.  Accordingly, the COMELEC
promulgated the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. Section 1 of Rule 41 thereof
expressly provides that â[i]n the absence of any applicable provision in [said]
Rules, the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court in the Philippines shall
be applicable by analogy or in a suppletory character and effect.â


This Court has
explicitly recognized and given approval to execution of judgments pending
appeal in election cases
[26]
 filed under existing election
laws.  In those cases, the immediate
execution was made in accordance with Section 2 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court
[27]
 reading as follows:


SEC. 2.  
Execution pending appeal
.  --  On motion of the prevailing
party with notice to the adverse party the court may,  in its discretion, order execution to issue even before the
expiration of the time to appeal, upon good reasons to be stated in a special
order.  If a record on appeal is filed
thereafter, the motion and the special order shall be included therein.


All that was
required for a valid exercise of the discretion to allow execution pending
appeal was that the immediate execution should be based âupon good reasons to
be stated in a special order.â  The
rationale why such execution is allowed in election cases is, as stated in 
Gahol
v. Riodique,
[28]
 âto give as much recognition to the
worth of a trial judgeâs decision as that which is initially ascribed by the
law to the proclamation by the board of canvassers.â  Thus:


Why should the proclamation by the
board of canvassers suffice as basis of the right to assume office, subject to
future contingencies attendant to a protest, and not the decision of a court of
justice?  Indeed, when it is considered
that the board of canvassers is composed of persons who are less technically
prepared to make an accurate appreciation of the ballots, apart from their
being more apt to yield to extraneous considerations, and that the board must
act summarily, practically raising [
sic
] against time, while, on the
other hand, the judge has benefit of all the evidence the parties can offer and
of admittedly better technical preparation and background, apart from his being
allowed ample time for conscientious study and mature deliberation before
rendering judgment, one cannot but perceive the wisdom of allowing the
immediate execution of decisions in election cases adverse to the protestees,
notwithstanding the perfection and pendency of appeals therefrom, as long as
there are, in the sound discretion of the court, good reasons therefor.


To deprive trial
courts of their discretion to grant execution pending appeal would, in the words
of 
Tobon Uy v. COMELEC
,


  bring back
the ghost of the âgrab-the-proclamation-prolong the protestâ techniques so
often resorted to by devious politicians in the past in their efforts to
perpetuate their hold to an elective office.  This would, as a consequence, lay to waste the will of the electorate.


What are the
recognized reasons for execution pending appeal in election cases?


In 
Gahol v.
Riodique
, the motion for execution pending appeal recited the following
reasons:


(a)  The
full term for municipal officials elected in the November 1971 elections
expires at the end of December 1975, thereby leaving protestant no more than
ten (10) months of the four-year-term to which she is rightfully entitled,
within which she may be able to seat [
sic
] and represent her
constituency;


(b)  In
view of the results of the referendum which was held on February 27, 1975,
President Ferdinand E. Marcos was granted the right to appoint local officials
in lieu of the elective [
sic
] ones and it is possible that protestantâs
opportunity to occupy the seat may even be effectively reduced;


(c)
         
  Considering the fully-substantiated
finding of massive fraud in the preparation of ballots cast in favor of the
protestee consisting, among others, of ballots written by one and the same
hand, any appeal that the protestee may interpose would be frivolous and
definitely dilatory in character; and


(d)
      
  Any further delay in protestantâs
assumption of office would prejudice the electorate.


In 
Tobon Uy
v. COMELEC
, where protestant Tobon Uy was credited with a slim margin of
only five votes, this Court stated:


In retrospect good reasons did, in
fact, exist which justified the RTC Order, dated 10 January 1991, granting
execution pending appeal.  Among others
mentioned by the RTC are the combined considerations of the near expiration of
the term of office, public interest, the pendency of the election contest for
more than three (3) years, and that TOBON UY had filed a bond in the amount of 
P
300,000.00
(Rollo, p. 46).


In 
Malaluan v.
COMELEC
,
[29]
 this Court declared:


Without evaluating the merits of the trial courtâs
actual appreciation of the ballots contested in the election protest, we note
on the face of its decision that the trial court relied on the findings of the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) handwriting experts which findings
private respondent did not even bother to rebut.  We thus see no reason to disregard the presumption of regularity
in the performance of official duty on the part of the trial court judge.  Capping this combination of circumstances
which impelled the grant of immediate execution is the undeniable urgency
involved in the political situation in the Municipality of Kidapawan, North
Cotabato.  The appeal before the COMELEC
would undoubtedly cause the political vacuum in said municipality to persist,
and so the trial court reasonably perceived execution pending appeal to be
warranted and justified.


In 
Gutierrez
v. COMELEC
,
[30]
 
this Court sustained the trial
courtâs finding of good reasons; thus:


[T]he protestee died on April 6, 1996 and it [was]
the Vice-Mayor who acted as Mayor after the protestee died and during the
pendency of this case before this Court; the protestant have been found to be
the true winner in the mayoralty race for Tiwi, Albay and should have been
sitting as such from July 1, 1995 to the present but was not able to sit; that
as of today, one-third of the term has already expired; that public interest
will be better served and it would be giving true meaning to the electoral will
of Tiwi, Albay that their chosen Mayor, the protestant herein, should
immediately sit as the Mayor and govern them instead of the Vice-Mayor.


In 
Lindo v.
COMELEC
,
[31]
 where the protestant obtained a
margin of 200 votes as adjudged by the trial court, this Court affirmed as good
reasons those relied upon by the trial court in granting execution pending
appeal; thus:


In its Order of execution, respondent RTC Judge Dilag
cited two reasons to justify execution of his decision pending appeal, viz.:
(1) the grant of execution would give substance and meaning to the peopleâs
mandate, especially since the RTC has established private respondentâs right to
the office; and (2) barely 18 months is left on the tenure of the Ternate mayor
and the people have the right to be governed by their chosen official.  In the recent case of Gutierrez v. COMELEC
[G.R. No. 126298, March 25, 1997], the same grounds for execution pending
appeal of the decision in the protest case were relied upon by the trial court
and we found them to be valid reasons for execution.


In a nutshell,
the following constitute âgood reasons,â and a combination of two or more of
them will suffice to grant execution pending appeal: (1)  the public interest involved or the will of
the electorate; (2) the shortness of the remaining portion of the term of the
contested office; and (3) the length of time that the election contest has been
pending.  The filing of a bond, which
was mentioned in 
Tobon Uy
, does not constitute a good reason.
[32]
 Nevertheless, the trial court may
require the filing of a bond as a condition for the issuance of a corresponding
writ of execution to answer for the payment of damages which the aggrieved
party may suffer by reason of the execution pending appeal.


In the instant
case, the trial court relied on the following as âgood reasonsâ for its grant
of execution pending appeal: (1) public interest, (2) near expiration of the
term of office involved, and (3) pendency of the election protest for one
year.  The trial court cannot,
therefore, be said to have acted with grave abuse of discretion.  Hence, the COMELEC acted correctly when it
denied SPR No. 14-96.  


If any error was
committed by the COMELEC, it was in the failure to resolve private respondentsâ
Motion To Dissolve/Recall Temporary Restraining Order and the petitionersâ
opposition thereto, as well as the Urgent Motion to Cite for Contempt, although
the motions were heard on 9 July 1996.  


Because of
COMELECâs inaction on the first motion, the temporary restraining order issued
on 6 June 1996 was taken full advantage of by the petitioners, who then refused
to surrender to the prevailing private respondents their offices.  This created an unwholesome spectacle: two
sets of officials exercising the functions of the elective local positions of
Guipos, Zamboanga del Sur.  Such a
situation was inimical to public interest and was a potential source of trouble
and even bloodshed between the contending partisan forces. The COMELEC should
have taken a more drastic and positive action to prevent such a situation by
complying strictly with the rule on restraining orders.  Under Section 5, Rule 30 of the COMELEC
Rules of  Procedure and Section 5, Rule
58 of the Rules of Court, the lifetime of a restraining order is only
twenty  days.  This period is nonextendible.
[33]
 If the COMELEC wanted to restrain
further the implementation of the trial courtâs order granting execution
pending appeal and the writ of execution, it should have, if warranted, issued
a writ of preliminary injunction; but it did not.


WHEREFORE
, the instant civil action is
DISMISSED for failure of the petitioners to show that respondent Commission on
Elections had acted with grave abuse of discretion in rendering the challenged
resolution of 23 September 1997 in SPR No. 14-96, which is hereby
AFFIRMED.  The 
status quo
 order
of 11 November 1997 is 
LIFTED
 and the Commission on Elections is
DIRECTED to forthwith cause the full implementation of the execution pending
appeal, unless it shall have been rendered academic by a decision adverse to
private respondents in the regular appeals filed by the petitioners with said
Commission.


Costs against
petitioners.

This provision has been amended by the 1997 Rules of
Civil Procedure; thus:


SEC. 2.  
Discretionary execution
.  


(a)  
Execution of a judgment or final order
pending appeal.
  -- On motion of the
prevailing party with notice to the adverse party filed in the trial court while
it has jurisdiction over the case and is in possession of either the original
record or the record on appeal, as the case may be, at the time of the filing
of such motion, said court may, in its discretion, order execution of a
judgment or final order even before the expiration of the period to appeal.


After the trial court has
lost jurisdiction, the motion for execution pending appeal may be filed in the
appellate court.


Discretionary execution may
only issue upon good reasons to be stated in a special order after due hearing.


(b)  
       
Execution
of several, separate or partial judgments
.  --  A several, separate or
partial judgment may be executed under the same terms and conditions as
execution of a judgment or final order pending appeal.
