FELIX P. UY, PETITIONER,
VS. COURT OF APPEALS, THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION AND ARTURO T. MILLANA, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


This is a
petition for review on certiorari filed by Engineer Felix P. Uy from the
decision of the Court of Appeals dated July 10, l996
[1]
 which affirmed the decision of the
Civil Service Commission.
[2]


The facts which
gave rise to the instant petition are as follows:


On September 27, l982, petitioner was
promoted by then Governor Valentina G. Plaza as Supervising Mechanical
Engineer, Equipment Pool Division, Provincial Engineering Office of Agusan del
Sur.
[3]


On February 26, l988, then Governor
Ceferino Paredes, issued Administrative Order No. 88-01 scaling down the
operations of the Provincial Engineering Office (PEO for brevity) by reducing
the number of its personnel. Sixty-two employees of the PEO, including
petitioner were affected by this order.


On May 11, l988, petitioner
received his notice of termination effective on May 16, l988 signed by Governor
Ceferino Paredes.
[4]
 
However, private respondent who holds the position of Mechanical
Engineer
[5]
 
(a position two (2) steps below that of petitioner)
was retained by Governor Paredes.


Thereafter, petitioner and the
sixty-one (61) other dismissed employees,  filed a complaint/ petition before the Merit System Protection Board
(MSPB for brevity), Civil Service Commission, assailing the legality of their
termination from office. 


While the petition was pending before
the MSPB, Governor Paredes reorganized the Equipment Pool Division, PEO and
renamed the same as Motor Pool Division, PEO. He abolished the position of
Supervising Mechanical Engineer and upgraded instead the next ranking position,
Senior Mechanical Engineer as the Chief of Division.
[6]
 
Thereafter, he appointed private respondent to the
said position while designating another, Engineer Carlito Capol,  to the position of Mechanical Engineer left
vacant by private respondent.
[7]


On July 1, l989, Republic Act 6758,
otherwise known as the Salary Standardization Law (SSL for brevity) took
effect. The positions at the PEO, Motor Pool Division were reclassified: the
Chief, Motor Pool Division was designated as Head Mechanical Engineer with the
equivalent rank of Engineer IV; Supervising Mechanical Engineer (previously
abolished by Governor Paredes) as Engineer III; and Senior Mechanical Engineer
as  Engineer  II.  Private  respondent 
being the current Chief,  Motor Pool Division, was designated by Governor Paredes to the
position of Head Mechanical Engineer. On January  29,  l993,  the  Merit  System  Protection  Board, Civil Service Commission, rendered its decision in MSPB Case No.
91-1739 declaring petitionerâs termination from the service including that of
the other employees assigned with the PEO illegal. The dispositive portion
thereof reads, to wit;


âWHEREFORE, in the light of the
foregoing, the board finds the petition of Emmie Hurbada, 
et al
.,
meritorious. Accordingly, the Petitioners who were illegally separated are
hereby ordered reinstated.â
[8]


On May
24, l993, the petitioners in MSPB Case No. 91-1739 filed a motion praying for
the Board  to issue an order directing
the Provincial Governor of Agusan del Sur ( who was then Governor Democrito
Plaza) to reinstate petitioners in the service and to declare invalid the
appointments of personnel who were then appointed by Governor Paredes in their
respective positions.
[9]


On June
24, l993, the MSPB issued an order directing the Provincial Governor of Agusan
del Sur to immediately implement the subject decision in the interest of
justice.
[10]


On
August 27, l993, Governor Plaza issued Memorandum Order No. 028-92 reinstating
petitioner to the Provincial Engineering Office, Motor Pool Division as
Engineer IV while revoking that of private respondent.  On September 1, l993, petitionerâs
appointment as Engineer IV was issued by the said governor.
[11]


For
failure of Governor Plaza to reinstate the rest of the petitioners despite the
issuance of several orders by MSPB, the case was elevated to the Civil Service
Commission (CSC for brevity).
[12]


On
March 21, l994, the CSC issued  Resolution No. 94-1567 declaring MSPB order dated January 29, l993 final
and executory and formally charging Governor Plaza with indirect contempt
pursuant to the provisions of the l987 Administrative Code for continued
refusal to reinstate the other petitioners in MSPB case No. 91-1739.
[13]


Private respondent raised the
legality of the order of Governor Plaza terminating his services as Engineer
IV, Motor Pool Division before the CSC.  On March 21, 1995, the CSC issued Resolution No. 95-2104, the
dispositive portion of which reads, to wit:


âWHEREFORE, the appeal of Arturo
Millana is hereby granted.  Accordingly,
the Provincial Government of Agusan del Sur is directed to cause the
reinstatement of Arturo J. Millana to the position of Engineer IV.  He is entitled to the payment of back
salaries and other benefits for the period that he had been out of the service.
Felix P. Uy should be reinstated  to a
position comparable with that which he was holding at the time of his illegal
termination.â
[14]


Governor Plaza and petitioner
herein filed their separate motions for reconsideration
[15]
 but the same were denied by the CSC in its
Resolution No. 955591 dated September 5, l995, the dispositive portion of which
reads, to wit:


âWHEREFORE, the instant Motions for
Reconsideration of Governor Democrito O. Plaza and Engineer Felix P. Uy are
hereby dismissed.  Accordingly, CSC
Resolution No. 95-2104 dated 21 March 1995 stands and the Provincial Government
of Agusan del Sur is directed to implement the same immediately."
[16]


On November 17, l995, petitioner
filed a petition for review before the respondent court assigning two errors
committed by the respondent CSC:
[17]


(l) that public respondent erred in
ruling as improper his reinstatement as Engineer IV in the provincial
engineering office of the province of Agusan del Sur and by directing that he
be reinstated to a position comparable with that he was holding at the time of
his dismissal;


(2) that public respondent erred
and failed to appreciate the fact that his former Supervising Mechanical
Engineer position which was abolished and replaced with a Senior Mechanical
Engineer and later classified as Engineer IV pursuant to RA 6758 are the same
and similar positions provided for in the plantilla of personnel, Provincial
Engineering Office, province of Agusan del Sur.


On July
10, l996, the respondent court rendered its decision denying the petition for
lack of merit.
[18]
 
It ruled that petitioner did not question the qualification of Millana
to the contested position and that the position of private respondent at the
time of his termination, Engineer IV, could not be that which was previously
occupied by the petitioner, which was Supervising Mechanical Engineer or
Engineer III.  The respondent court
further stressed that an appointment whether to a vacancy or to a newly created
position is essentially within the discretionary power of whomsoever it is
vested.  A copy of the said decision was
received by petitionerâs counsel on July 17, l996.


On July 26, l996, petitionerâs
counsel filed a motion for extension of time to file a motion for
reconsideration which was denied by the respondent court in its Resolution
dated August 7, l996.  The order
likewise declared the finality of the  decision of the respondent court.


On
August 20, l996, petitionerâs counsel filed his motion for reconsideration
[19]
 which was later denied by the respondent court  in its Resolution dated September 4, l996.
[20]


Hence, this petition.


Petitioner
reiterated the assigned errors in his petition for review before the respondent
court in addition to the claim  that the
said court erred in applying the rulings of this Court in Panis
 vs. 
CSC,
229 SCRA 509(1994); Mendilla 
vs.
 CSC; Central Bank 
vs. 
CSC;
Rimonte 
vs.
 CSC, and Lapinid 
vs.
 CSC.


Public
respondent, on the other hand, maintains that the issue left for this court to
consider is whether or nor petitionerâs motion for reconsideration was filed
before the Court of Appeals within the reglementary period.  It argued that the respondent court acted
correctly in denying petitionerâs motion for reconsideration for having been
filed out of time, citing the rulings of this court in Habaluyas Enterprises 
v.

Japzon; Lacsamana 
v.
 Second Special Cases Division of the Intermediate
Appellate Court; Rolloque 
v.
 Court of Appeals; and Caltex (Phil), Inc. 
v.

Intermediate Appellate Court.  It also
added that the respondent court acted correctly in upholding the CSCâc ruling
that petitioner may not be reinstated to the new position of Engineer IV at the
expense of Millana who enjoys the status of a permanent employee and is
entitled to security of tenure.


We find for the respondent.


The failure of a party to perfect his appeal in the manner
and within the period fixed by law renders the decision sought to be appealed
final, with the result that no court can exercise appellate jurisdiction to
review the decision.  For it is more
important that a case be settled than it be settled right.  It is only in exceptional cases when we have
allowed a relaxation of the rules governing the periods of appeal.
[21]


A careful
perusal of this case reveals that the decision of the respondent court had
become final and executory due to the failure of petitioner to file his motion
for reconsideration within the reglementary period. Since petitionerâs counsel
received a copy of the decision on July 17, l996, the aforesaid motion should
have been filed   not later than August
1, l996. Petitionerâs filing of a motion for extension of time to file a motion
for reconsideration on July 26, l996 and the motion for reconsideration only on
August 20, l996, was a procedural lapse fatal to his cause.


Not only was the said motion for extension of time to file a
motion for reconsideration declared prohibited by several rulings of this Court
but the Interim Rules of the respondent court likewise provides that the period
for filing a motion for reconsideration is non-extendible.
[22]
 The denial of aforesaid motions by
the respondent court is therefore correct. In fact, the filing of said motion
for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration did not suspend/toll
the running of the reglementary period which in effect renders the assailed
decision final and beyond the jurisdiction of this court


This Court has ruled as early as 1986 in the case of
Habaluyas Enterprises 
v.
 Japzon
[23]
 and reiterated in Lacsamana 
v.

Second Special Cases Division of the Intermediate Appellate Court
[24]
 that no motion for extension of
time to file a motion for new trial or reconsideration may be filed with the
Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Courts, the Regional Trial Courts, and the
Intermediate Appellate Court.  In fact,
the court has time and again consistently upheld strict adherence to aforesaid
rule.
[25]
 In Rolloque, 
et al., vs. 
CA,

et al.,
 this Court said:


âThe filing by petitioners of a
motion for extension of time to file motion for reconsideration did not toll
the fifteen (15) days period before a judgment becomes final and executory.


Since the decision of respondent
Court of Appeals dated November 28, 1986 has long become final and executory at
the time of the filing of this petition, this Court can no longer alter or
modify the same.â
[26]


We find no
reason for counsel of petitioner to be unaware of the aforesaid rulings of this
court.  As counsel for petitioner, he
failed to observe the responsibility imposed on him as a member of the bar to
keep abreast with the latest developments of the law.
[27]
 Counselâs failure or negligence
cannot be sanctioned considering that it has been ten (10) years since the
decision in the Habaluyas case and reiterated in subsequent cases was
promulgated.  Indeed, negligence or mistake
of counsel necessarily binds the client.
[28]


Moreover, a
review of the decision of the respondent court will show that no reversible
error has been made.  As aptly observed
by that court:


âThe Civil Service
Commission did not deny petitionerâs right to be reinstated to his former
position but only declared as improper the manner by which his reinstatement
was effected.

Petitioner did not question
the qualifications of Millana to the contested position.  It is so because an appointment whether to a
vacancy or to a newly created position is essentially within the discretionary
power of whomsoever it is vested, (Panis 
v.
 Civil Service Commission,
227 SCRA 509 [1994]).  Once a candidate
possesses the minimum qualities required by law, sufficient discretion, if not
plenary, is granted to the appointing authority (Mendenilla 
v. 
Civil
Service Commission, 194 SCRA 278 [1991], Central Bank 
v.
 Civil Service
Commission, 171 SCRA 744 [1989]).


While
the choice of an appointee from among those who possess the required
qualification is a political and administrative decision (Rimonte 
v.

Civil Service Commission, 244 SCRA 498 [1995]), such discretion cannot be
exercised arbitrarily to remove a permanent employee occupying the position
without violating (the) latterâs right to security of tenure.  It is a settled rule that the Civil Service
Commission has no authority to revoke an appointment simply because it
considers another employee to be better qualified for that would constitute an
encroachment on the discretion vested in the appointing authority (Lapinid 
v.

Civil Service Commission, 197 SCRA 106 [1991]).


The argument that
petitioner should have been the one appointed because he was next in rank to
the contested position cannot be upheld.â
[29]


In passing, the
Court would like to reiterate the time-honored doctrine that factual findings
of administrative bodies should be accorded not only respect but even finality
as they are supported by substantial evidence even if not overwhelming or
preponderant
[30]
 or that administrative agencies
which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to
specific matters.
[31]
 Considering the factual and legal
precedents in the case at bar, the petition must be denied.


WHEREFORE,
 IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, finding
no reversible error in the decision of the respondent court, the petition is
hereby DENIED for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.
