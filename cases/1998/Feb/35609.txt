PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. FLORÂ  N.Â  LAUREL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


This is an
appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila finding
accused-appellant Flor  N. Laurel guilty
of illegal recruitment in large scale penalized under Art. 38, par. (b), in
relation to Art. 39, par. (a), of the Labor Code.


From 19 October
1991 to 25 May 1992 accused-appellant Flor N. Laurel promised employment abroad
for a fee to complaining witnesses Ricardo San Felipe, Rosauro San Felipe,
Juanito Cudal and Cenen Tambongco, Jr.  However, after receiving 
P
12,000.00 from Tambongco,  Jr.,  
P
11,000.00  from each
of  the San Felipe brothers and 
P
6,000.00
from Cudal, Laurel reneged on her promises and went into hiding.  Verification with the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) revealed that Laurel was neither licensed nor authorized
to  recruit workers for overseas
employment.
[1]
 Consequently, she was haled to
court and charged with large scale illegal recruitment. 


Accused Laurel
did not deny the charge against her.  Instead, when called to the witness stand, she presented an affidavit of
desistance by Juanito Cudal as well as several receipts, Exhs. "2,"
"3," "4," "5" and "6," signed by the
other private complainants acknowledging payment by her of the amounts taken
from them in "
full settlement
" of her obligation.
[2]
 Thus, on the basis of these
documents, she moved to dismiss the case.  But the court 
a quo
  denied her motion on the ground that the elements of large scale illegal
recruitment were established beyond reasonable doubt through the combined
testimonies of the four (4) offended parties.  The court 
a quo
  noted
that the affidavit of desistance as well as the receipts for payments made were
prepared and signed after the prosecution had already rested its case.  Consequently, the trial judge rendered a
decision convicting the accused Flor N. Laurel and sentenced her to  life imprisonment and to pay a fine of 
P
100,000.00
conformably with Art. 39, par. (a), of the Labor Code.  In addition, the accused was ordered to
return the balance of what she had received from each complainant.
[3]
 Hence,
this appeal.


As in the court
below, accused-appellant does not deny the charge against her.  She contends however that she should have
been convicted only of 
simple
 illegal recruitment and not of 
large
scale
  illegal recruitment.  


She argues
through counsel that since illegal recruitment in large scale is defined in
Art. 38, par. (b), of the Labor Code immediately following the definition of
illegal recruitment committed by a syndicate, it follows that for illegal
recruitment to be considered committed in large scale it should have been
committed by a syndicate.  Hence, an
individual who commits an act of illegal recruitment even if it be against
three (3) or more persons cannot be charged with illegal recruitment in large
scale.


The  interpretation is completely erroneous.  Article 38, par. (b), of the Labor Code
reads: 


Illegal recruitment when 
committed
by a syndicate
 
or
 
in large scale
 shall be considered an offense
involving  economic sabotage  x x x x


Illegal recruitment is
deemed 
committed by a syndicate
 if carried  out 
by
  a group of
three (3) or more persons conspiring and/or confederating  with  one another  in carrying out any
unlawful or illegal transaction, enterprise or scheme defined under the first
paragraph hereof.


Illegal recruitment is
deemed 
committed in large scale
 if committed 
against
 three (3) or
more persons individually or as  a group
(
underscoring  supplied
). 


The language of
the law is very clear that illegal recruitment is committed in large scale if
done 
against three or more persons
 individually or as a group.  The number of offenders, whether an  individual or a syndicate, is clearly not
considered a factor in the determination of its commission.  The rule is well-settled that when the
language of the statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity, there is no
room for attempted interpretation or extended court rationalization of the law.
[4]
 
The duty of the court is to apply it, not to interpret
it.
[5]
 
Counsel for accused-appellant was misled by the fact
that illegal recruitment in large scale is defined immediately after illegal
recruitment by a syndicate.  However,
the only reason therefor is that they are both considered offenses involving
economic sabotage as the law itself so provides.  Besides, we have affirmed time and again the conviction of an
individual for large scale illegal recruitment.
[6]


As regards the
alleged desistance by private complaints, we rule that  although an affidavit of desistance may be
given due course even if executed only on appeal, it may be given such credit
only when special circumstances exist engendering doubt on the criminal
liability  of  the accused.
[7]
 Otherwise, without such special
circumstances, courts look  with  disfavor  on  affidavits  of  retraction
[8]
 considering  them  as  exceedingly unreliable.
[9]


There is
absolutely nothing in the affidavits of retraction executed by private
complainants which creates doubt on the guilt of accused-appellant.  The complainants merely allege that they
made a mistake and "misunderstood  the  circumstances."
[10]
 However,  aside  from such sweeping
statement as "misunderstood the circumstances," no detail is given as
to how their mistake or misapprehension of circumstances can indicate absence
of or at least cast doubt on the guilt  of accused-appellant.  On the
contrary, we have every reason to conclude that the affidavits of retraction
were executed by private complainants only because accused-appellant returned
the money   taken from them as evidenced
by the receipts marked as Exhs.  "2,"  "3,"  "4,"
"5" and "6."
[11]
 As complainant Ricardo San Felipe
testified in court:  "I  will withdraw, if  the payments  is  (sic) complete, sir."
[12]
 Thus, given the reason for their desistance,
the solemn testimonies given by private complainants shall not be disregarded
for it is a matter of public interest that every  crime must be prosecuted and the author thereof penalized.
[13]


WHEREFORE
, the Decision of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila convicting accused-appellant Flor N. Laurel of illegal
recruitment in large scale penalized under Art. 38, par.  (b),  in relation to Art. 39, par.  (a), of the Labor  Code and
sentencing her to life imprisonment is  AFFIRMED.  However, the portion of
the appealed decision directing accused-appellant to pay the balance of what
she had received from each of private complainants is DELETED in view of the
full settlement of her civil liability as acknowledged by private complainants
themselves.
