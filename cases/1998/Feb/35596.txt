MARTINEZ, J.:


This is an
appeal from the decision
[1]
 dated October 3, 1994, of the
Regional Trial Court of La Union, Branch 31, in Criminal Case No. A-2359,
convicting Arturo Lagao of murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua, 
with all
 
accessory penalties provided by law.
 
 


The Information,
dated March 5, 1992, charged the accused-appellant, together  with Virgilio Lagao and  Arturo Catheza, as follows:


âThe undersigned 2nd Assistant
Provincial Prosecutor accuses ARTURO LAGAO, VIRGILIO LAGAO, ARTURO CATHEZA and
JOHN DOE of the crime of MURDER, committed as follows:


âThat at about 1:00 oâclock in the
very early morning of the 30th day of June, 1991, in the Municipality of
Rosario, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and being then
armed with a bladed weapon and wooden clubs, did then and there, conspiring and
confederating together and mutually helping one another, and by means of
treachery and taking advantage of their superior strength, willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously stab with the said bladed weapon and club with the
said wooden clubs one MARCOS DE LA CRUZ Y CALONGE who was not then in a
position to defend himself, and thereby inflicting on the aforenamed victim
mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the
damage and prejudice of his heirs.


âCONTRARY
TO Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.â
[2]


Only Arturo
Lagao was arrested to face trial.  When
arraigned, he entered a plea of not guilty.  The other two (2) accused, Virgilio Lagao and Arturo Catheza, have
evaded arrest up to the time of trial.


The evidence for
the prosecution tends to establish the following facts:  


At about 1:00
oâclock in the morning of June 30, 1991, at Barangay Gumot, Rosario, La Union,
Marcos dela Cruz was clubbed to death by Arturo Lagao, Virgilio Lagao and
Arturo Catheza.  The gory incident was
witnessed by Alfredo Calonge and  Enrique Calonge, the victimâs uncles. 


Alfredo Calonge
testified that he woke up at about 1:00 oâclock in the morning when he heard a
noise outside his house.  He went to the
porch and saw Arturo Lagao repeatedly clubbing Marcos dela Cruz with a piece of
wood and a lead pipe.
[3]
 Then, the accused Virgilio Lagao
hit Marcos several times (âaround seven (7) timesâ) with a piece of wood.
[4]
 Finally, Arturo Catheza clubbed
Marcos five (5) times likewise with a piece of wood.
[5]
 According to Alfredo, he and his
wife witnessed the incident which lasted about an hour from a distance of about
eight (8) meters.
[6]
 However, they did not lift a finger
to help their nephew because they were afraid.
[7]
 He then went down and saw Marcos
sprawled on the ground in a fetus-like position.
[8]
 He informed the barangay captain of
the incident and both of them proceeded to the Rosario police station and with
two policemen went to the town proper.
[9]
 Thereafter, Alfredo and the police
officers returned to the scene of the clubbing incident.
[10]
 The police officers then
interviewed him as to how Marcos was killed.
[11]


During
cross-examination, Alfredo testified that there were four assailants who were
naked from the waist up and he was alone at his porch when he witnessed the
clubbing, his wife being in another house.
[12]
 The four assailants were carrying
pipes about 1Â½ feet long and nothing else.
[13]
 And, he did not count the number of
times the assailants hit his nephew.
[14]
 After the clubbing, the four left.
[15]


Enrique Calonge,
who is a neighbor of Alfredo Calonge, declared that in the early morning of
June 30, 1991, he was awakened by his wife because of a commotion outside his
house.
[16]
 Curious, Enrique  went  to  a  window, opened it and saw Marcos lying on the ground about five (5)
meters away.
[17]
 He overheard Marcos pleading
âPlease pity me Manong, I do not have fault.â
[18]
 According to Enrique, he saw Arturo
Lagao holding a 
madre de cacao
 piece of wood and Virgilio Lagao also
brandishing a piece of wood, club his nephew, Marcos, while Arturo Catheza kept
watch on him.
[19]
 He did not do anything except to
tell the assailants to have pity on his nephew but they did not listen.
[20]
 After being hit with the wooden
clubs, Marcos fell into a precipice.
[21]
 Arturo Lagao then ran away while
Virgilio and Catheza stayed behind to make sure that Marcos  was dead.
[22]
 After confirming that Marcos was
lifeless, the two (2) likewise fled.
[23]
 Enrique further  stated   that  he  did  not  see  Alfredo  Calonge at the latterâs porch.
[24]


On
cross-examination, he testified that when he woke up at 1:00 oâclock in the
morning, he saw Alfredo Calonge alone at his lighted porch.
[25]
 After the incident, he went back to
sleep and was awakened at about 4:00 oâclock in the morning of June 30, 1991,
by the noise of people who went to view Marcosâ lifeless body.
[26]
 He likewise went to look at his
nephewâs cadaver.
[27]
 When confronted with his sworn
statement,
[28]
 Enrique affirmed that when questioned
by PFC Rolando Rivera as to the identities of Marcos dela Cruzâ assailants, he
did not say anything.
[29]


Dr. Bonifacio
Sales of the Rosario Emergency Hospital conducted a 
post mortem

examination of the cadaver of Marcos dela Cruz in the morning of June 30,
1991.  He thereafter issued a 
post
mortem
 certificate which shows that the cause of death was a stab wound.
[30]


During the
trial, Dr. Sales  testified  that the  cause  of death of the victim was
a âstab wound penetrating 6 inches depth with the length of 1 Â½ inches along
the left mid-auxiliary fold.â
[31]
 He further stated that when he
examined the body of Marcos dela Cruz, he found only two wounds, i.e., a
contusion and a stab wound.
[32]


Appellant Arturo
Lagao denies participation in the killing of Marcos dela Cruz.  His defense is simply alibi.  He claims that from May 1991 up to and until
July 1991, he was working as a laborer during the construction of the house of
one Erlinda Coroganan at Baguio City.
[33]
 In the evening of June 29, 1991,
he, together with Ben Acupanda and Eugene Norton had a drinking session at the
latterâs house at Lower Cabinet Hill, Baguio City.
[34]
 The group drank until 12:00
midnight.
[35]
 Thereafter, having drank too much
liquor, he slept at Hortonâs house.
[36]
 In the morning of June 30, 1991, he
worked at the construction site.
[37]
 During the entire period of his
stay in Baguio City, he stayed at the house of barangay captain Asterio Caccam
located at Lower Cabinet Hill, Baguio City.
[38]


Asterio Caccam
and Eugene Horton corroborated appellantâs alibi.  


The trial court,
however, disbelieved appellantâs alibi.  He was found guilty of the crime charged on the basis of the eyewitness
accounts of the Calonges positively identifying him as one of the assailants.


In its decision
dated October 3, 1994, the trial court convicted the appellant as follows:


âIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the
Court finds the accused ARTURO LAGAO y CACAYURAN guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of the crime of MURDER and hereby sentences the accused ARTURO LAGAO to suffer
the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to indemnify the offended party in
the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (
P
50,000.00) and expenses incurred by
the complainant in the amount of EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (
P
18,000.00).


âAccused VIRGILIO LAGAO y CACAYURAN
and ARTURO CATHEZA shall be tried as soon as they will be placed within the
fold of the law.  After the Promulgation
of the Decision as against accused ARTURO C. LAGAO let the records of this case
be placed in the ARCHIVES to be retrieved as soon as the said two (2) accused
will be arrested.


âIT IS SO ORDERED.â


Hence, this
appeal seeking the reversal of the court a quoâs decision, appellant raising as
the lone assignment of error, viz:


âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 GRAVELY
ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS ONE OF THE
AUTHORS OF THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.â


Appellant
questions the credibility of eyewitnesses Alfredo Calonge and Enrique Calonge,
who both positively identified him as one of Marcos dela Cruzâ assailants.  He claims that the trial court failed to see
the infirmities in the aforesaid witnesses testimonies which allegedly show
that they were not present during the incident in question.


There is merit
to the appeal.


A scrutiny of
the prosecutionâs evidence does not support the trial courtâs conclusion that
the appellant is guilty of the crime charged.  There are blatant flaws in the testimonies of Alfredo Calonge and
Enrique Calonge, the alleged eyewitnesses, which cast serious doubt on the
positive identification of appellant.


We are well
aware of the long settled rule that when the issue is one of the credibility of
witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the
trial court.
[39]
 This is so because the trial court
is in a better position to decide the question having heard the witnesses and
observed their deportment and manner of testifying, unless certain facts of
substance and value have been overlooked which, if considered, might affect the
result of the case.
[40]
 However, the factual findings of
the trial court may nonetheless be reversed if by the evidence on record or
lack of it, it appears that the trial court erred.
[41]


This is such a
case.  We find that the evidence of the
prosecution lacks sufficient foundation for the trial courtâs verdict of guilty
beyond reasonable doubt.


At the outset,
it is to be noted that the Information  alleges that appellant and his co-accused, armed with a bladed weapon
and wooden clubs âstabbed with the said bladed weapon and with the said wooden
clubs (Marcos de la Cruz y Calonge) xxx xxx thereby inflicting on the aforesaid
victim mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his
death.â  A meticulous reading of the
testimonies of Enrique and Alfredo fail to support the allegation that the
victim was 
stabbed 
by any of the assailants.  These eyewitnesses categorically and positively declared that
Marco dela Cruz was 
clubbed
 to death.


Alfredo Calonge
gave a graphic description of how he witnessed the assault on Marcos dela Cruz,
thus:


â Q â What cause (sic) the death of
Marcos dela Cruz, Mr. Witness, if you know?


â A â He was clubbed by Arturo
Lagao, Virgilio Lagao and Arturo Catheza, sir.

â A â Around ten (10) times, sir.


â Q â What about Arturo Catheza,

that place, what did you do?


â A â I

[43]


Enrique Calonge
echoed the testimony of Alfredo Calonge but declared that it was only the
appellant and Virgilio Lagao who clubbed to death his nephew. His testimony
reads as follows:


â Q â You said that Marcos dela
Cruz was being killed by Arturo Lagao, Virgilio Lagao and Arturo Catheza. Will

â Q â How long did Arturo Lagao and
Virgilio Lagao clubbed (sic) Marcos dela Cruz?


â A â In a short while, sir.

â Q â While they were clubbing Marcos

sir.


â Q â Did you say that in the
Ilocano dialect?


â A â
Yes, sir.â
[44]


Alfredo and
Enrique could not have been mistaken as to the weapons used by the assailants.
Alfredo witnessed the gory episode from his front porch at a distance of about
eight (8) meters. On the other hand, Enrique watched his nephew being clubbed
from a distance of five (5) meters.  And, the crime scene was bathed not only by moonlight but  further illuminated by an incandescent bulb
from the house of Alfredo.


However, it
seems that Marcos dela Cruz was not clubbed to death.  The cause of death was a single stab wound. Dr. Bonifacio Sales
who conducted the 
post-mortem
 examination issued a certificate which
shows the following injuries:


âContusion, hematoma, lower lip.


Cause
of death, stab wound penetrating six (6) inches depth and 1 Â½ inches in length
along the left mid-auxiliary fold.â
[45]


Dr. Sales
confirmed his findings when he testified during the trial. Quoted hereunder is
the relevant testimony of Dr. Sales:


âQ -  In your findings you stated that there was a contusion with hematoma
on the lower lip, what could have caused your first finding?


âA -  It could be a blow by a hard object on the lower lip, it could be
a hard pressure exerted on the lower lip.


âQ -  With respect to your second finding it is stated there was a stab
wound penetrating 6 inches deep and 1 Â½ inches in length along the mid
auxiliary fold, what could have caused that injuries?


âA -  It might have been caused by a bladed object or instrument.


âQ
 
-  And now doctor, what was the cause of the
death of the victim?


âA
 
-  Stab wound penetrating 6 inches deep with
the length of 1 Â½ inches along the left mid auxiliary fold.


âQ
 -  
That caused the death of Marcos dela Cruz?


âA

-  
Yes, sir.â
[46]


The doctor
further declared on the witness stand that he found only two wounds on the body
of Marcos dela Cruz.  Here is his
testimony: 


âQ -  Doctor, we understand from you that you are the one who looked
after the body of the victim, Marcos dela Cruz on that day of June 30, 1991?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  And that you looked at his wound and you found there are two
wounds in the body?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  One stab wound and the other one, contusion?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  And according to you, the contusion is caused by a hard object?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  And the stab wound, there is one?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  And those were the only wounds found in the body of the victim?


âA -  Yes, sir.â
[47]


Under the
circumstances, Dr. Salesâ testimony gives the distress signal to the alleged
eyewitnessesâ accounts of Enrique and Alfredo Calonge.  For, Dr. Sales, an expert witness, to whom
no evil motive may be ascribed, apparently never found any wound or injury on
the head or anatomy of Marcos dela Cruz which could be attributed to a severe
clubbing. The contusion on the  left
lower lip of the victim, which the doctor said could have been caused by âa
hard pressure exerted on the lower lip,â may have been, to our mind, the result
of a fist blow, not a club. Moreover, the testimony of Enrique that his nephew
was clubbed for one hour, is difficult to believe. If this was the case, then
Marcos would have had his skull bashed wide-open or he would have been beaten
to a pulp. 


The trial court
brushed aside the absence of evidence as to how  the victim was stabbed as a minor inconsistency, reasoning that:


âxxx The
minor inconsistency as to the club used and the fact that there was no
testimony as to how the deceased was stabbed could be explained by the fact
that the witness saw the incident at the later stage of the crime, said minor
inconsistencies according to the long line of Decisions of the Supreme Court
strengthens their testimonies rather than weaken them.â
[48]


We do not
agree.  The inconsistency is not minor,
as concluded by the trial court, but touches upon a material point relative to
the identification of the assailant/s. It overlooked a substantial fact which
is of value and which would affect the result of the case. For, the Information
alleged that the victim was stabbed and clubbed. Absent any evidence that
Marcos was stabbed, then the court 
a quoâs
 conclusion that the stabbing
could have occurred at the early stage of the assault is  mere conjecture on its part. 


The trial court
failed to take into account that Alfredo and Enrique categorically declared
that the weapons used by the assailants were a tube (or iron) pipe and wooden
clubs. Alfredo, on cross-examination, positively stated that all of the
assailants were holding pipes. His testimony runs thus:


âQ - All those four (4) persons
were holding pipes, is that your testimony?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  How long were these pipes that you saw those four (4) persons
were holding?


âA -  (Witness indicating  the
length about one and a half (1 Â½) feet.


x x x
                                             
x x
x
                                     
x x
x


  âQ -  You never saw anyone
of them holding anything except those pipes?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  You remember that you are under oath, Mr. witness.


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  And under oath you are saying that these four (4) persons were
holding pipes only?


âA -  Yes, sir.â
[49]


It is to be
noted that the aforequoted declaration of Alfredo clashes with his direct
testimony that the assailants of Marcos dela Cruz wielded wooden clubs, except
Arturo Lagao, who was armed with an iron pipe and a wooden club.  


On the other
hand, Enrique never mentioned on the witness stand that any of the assailants
was armed with a knife. 


Moreover, if one
of the assailants stabbed Marcos with a bladed weapon at the early stages of
the assault, as the trial court insinuates, then we see no reason why the
appellant and the others would continue the attack by clubbing the victim.
Since the intention was to kill, the quickest and surest way was by the use of
a knife. Thus, we can only conclude that Enrique and Alfredo did not witness
how Marcos dela Cruz was killed and there is doubt as to their identification
of the appellant as one of the killers.


It is further
disconcerting to find that during the preliminary examination conducted by the
municipal trial judge of Rosario, La Union on July 5,1991, Alfredo and Enrique
gave conflicting statements. Alfredo declared that the appellant stabbed Marcos
dela Cruz. Excerpts from his statement are quoted hereunder:


â Q â Do you know what happened to
Marcos dela Cruz on June 30, 1991, at 1:00 oâclock in the early dawn?


â A- I know, sir.


â Q â What happened to him?


â A â He was killed, sir.


â Q â Do you know who killed him?


â A â I know, sir. 


âQ â Who?


âA -- Arturo Lagao, Virgilio Lagao
and Arturo Catheza.


â Q â Did you actually witness the
incident?


â A â Yes, sir.


â Q â How far were you from them
when he was being mauled?


â A â Eight (8) meters, sir.


â Q â Now, what was the first thing
that you saw?


â A â Arturo Lagao, sir.


â Q â What did Arturo Lagao do?


â A â He stabbed the deceased, sir.


â Q â How about Virgilio Lagao,
what did he do?


â A- Virgilio Lagao clubbed the
deceased, sir.


â Q â How about Arturo Catheza,
what was his participation?


â A â He
clubbed the deceased, sir.â
[50]


On the other
hand, Enrique stated that appellant clubbed the deceased.  His statement is quoted in part, thus:


â Q â Do you know what happened to
Marcos dela Cruz on June 30, 1991, at 1:00 oâ clock dawn?


â A- Yes, sir.


â Q â What happened to him?


â A â He was clubbed, sir.


â Q â Who clubbed him?


â A â Arturo Lagao, Virgilio Lagao
and Arturo Catheza.


â Q â How do you know that he was
clubbed by the three (3) accused?


â A â I heard a sounds of clubbing
and I look through the window.


â Q â What did you see when you
look through the window?


â A â I saw Marcos dela Cruz was
being clubbed.


â Q â Who was clubbing him when you
saw him?


â A â Arturo Lagao and Virgilio
Lagao.


â Q â You did not see who stabbed
him?


â A â No, sir, because when I look
through the window he was already lied prostrate to the ground he was being
clubbed.

  â Q â How far were you from them when you saw Marcos dela Cruz
being clubbed?


â A- Eight (8) meters, sir, from my
house.


â Q â Did  you not hear any altercation before the stabbing?


â A â
None, sir.â
[51]


However, during
the trial, these eyewitnesses swore that Marcos dela Cruz was clubbed to death
by appellant and his co-accused.


In the case of 
People
vs. Cruz,
[52]
 this Court said:  


â Jurisprudence teaches us that
where the sworn statement given during the preliminary examination conflicts
with that given during the trial, and the variance in the answers of the
witness is greatly disturbing and irreconcilable, the testimony of the said
witness should not be given in evidence, as the discrepancy in the witnessâ
statements shows that he was either lying when he executed it or he had simply
forgotten what he truly witnessed. Simply stated, serious and inexplicable
discrepancies between a previously executed sworn statement of a witness and
his testimonial declarations as to the appellantâs participation in the commission
of a crime raise a grave doubt on the veracity of his account.â


It is true that
the findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to
great weight on appeal.
[53]
 And, the rule is not changed simply
because of some inconsequential inconsistencies that are discovered upon a
faultfinding scrutiny of the records.
[54]
 However, we have not embarked on a
faultfinding expedition but to ferret out the truth.  For, it is our sworn duty to mete out  justice  to  every  person  who comes to this Court
especially one accused of a grievous crime such as murder.


We have gone
over the entire record with a fine-tooth comb, not with the intention of
nitpicking, but to determine the truth.  In so doing, we unearthed inconsistencies, though seemingly minor, but
when taken into account with the above discussed flaws in the prosecutionâs
evidence, would bolster the finding that indeed the identification of appellant
as one of the assailants is open to doubt.  


Thus, we note
that while Alfredo testified that accused-appellant and his co-accused took
turns in clubbing the victim;  Enrique
declared that only accused-appellant and Virgilio Lagao clubbed his nephew,
with Arturo Catheza keeping an eye on him.  Then, while Alfredo declared that the clubbing lasted an hour; Enrique
said it was only for a short time.  According to Enrique, he and his wife witnessed the clubbing from their
porch;  but Alfredo said he did not see
either of them at the porch.


Another aspect
of the entire episode which defies logic is that after Enrique saw his nephew
clubbed and fall into a precipice (could be a ditch) and after the assailants
fled, he went back to bed.  Note his
testimony, thus:


âQ -  The question Mr. witness, what time did you go and see the body
of Marcos dela Cruz when you went.  It
is not 1:00 when you saw the body?


âA -  At  4:00 oâclock, sir.

x x
x


  âQ -  What made you wake up
at 4:00 that morning?


âA -  I was surprised because of the noise of the people who went to
succor the body of Marcos dela Cruz.


âQ -  You are very sure that that was 4:00 oâclock in the morning that
you went to see the body of Marcos dela Cruz?


âA -  Yes, sir.


âQ -  And when you went there Marcos dela Cruz was already dead?


âA -  Yes, sir.


x x x

  âQ -  So, how many minutes
(sic) did you wake up on that night of June 29, 1991?


âA -  Twice, sir.


âQ -  And the first time that you woke up, what did you do?


âA -  I looked out through the window.


âQ -  That is the first time and the second time was when you went to
urinate?


âA -  At 4:00 I went down.â
[55]


To go back to
sleep is not a normal reaction.  The
natural thing to do would have been to immediately investigate if his nephew
was still alive and needed medical help.  


Appellant has
distanced himself from the killing declaring that he was in Baguio City on the
date and time thereof.  Alibi, it is
said, is the weakest of all defenses.  True.  But, it is always the duty
of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused upon the strength of its
own evidence and not by the weakness of that of the accused.
[56]
 While the defense of alibi can
easily be fabricated, it is not always false and without merit  and when coupled with the improbabilities and
uncertainties of the prosecutionâs evidence, the defense of alibi deserves
merit.
[57]
 We must take into consideration all
the evidence on record, which after a conscientious scrutiny may be sufficient
to acquit him.
[58]
 We also take into account the
constitutional presumption of innocence
[59]
 which an accused need not prove. 


In the light of
the foregoing circumstances, it is our considered view that the appellant must
be acquitted.  This is not to say that
the appellant could not have participated in the killing of Marcos dela
Cruz.  All that we do say is that the
evidence of the prosecution does not prove the guilt of the accused-appellant
beyond reasonable doubt.  We are
likewise aware that appellantâs co-accused, Virgilio Lagao and Arturo Catheza,
are still at large.  And, to free
appellant would redound to their benefit.  However, we are left with no choice.  Considering the evidence on record, appellant must go free.


WHEREFORE
, by reason of reasonable doubt, the
judgment of the Regional Trial Court of La Union dated 3 October 1994 is SET
ASIDE and appellant ARTURO LAGAO y CACAYURAN is hereby ACQUITTED. Appellant is
hereby ordered released from detention unless he is detained for some other
crime.


SO ORDERED.
