PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. ALEJANDRO ATOP @ âALI,â ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The trial court
sentenced the appellant to death, holding that his common-law relationship with
the victimâs grandmother aggravated the penalty.  We hold, however, that Sec. 11 of  RA 7659 prescribes the capital penalty in rape, only âwhen the
victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent,
ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within
the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim,â
and not by reason of any other kinship.  On the other hand, ârelationshipâ as an alternative aggravating
circumstance under Art. 15 of the Revised Penal Code encompasses only âthe
spouse, ascendant, descendant, legitimate, natural or adopted brother or
sister, and relative by affinity in the same degrees.â  Outside these enumerations and consistent
with the doctrine that criminal laws must be liberally construed in favor of
the accused, no other relationship, kinship or association between the offender
and the victim may aggravate the imposable penalty for the crime
committed.  The fact, then, that the
offended party is the granddaughter or descendant of appellantâs live-in
partner cannot justify the imposition of death upon the rapist.


The Case


This is a
combined appeal from, and an automatic review of, the Joint Decision of the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, of Ormoc City, finding Appellant Alejandro
Atop, alias âAli,â guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of rape
and sentencing him to two (2) terms of 
reclusion perpetua  
for the first two counts, and to death
for the third.


On April 21,
1995, Provincial Prosecutor I Rosario D. Beleta filed four separate
informations
[1]
 against accused-appellant charging
him with rape on three separate occasions -- on October 9, 1992, sometime in
1993 and on December 26, 1994 -- as well as with attempted rape on December 31,
1994.  The informations charging rape,
except for the date of commission and the age of the victim, similarly allege
the following:


âThat on or about the 9th day of
October, 1992, at Sitio Tambunan, Brgy. Sta. Rosa, Municipality of Matag-ob,
Province of Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then
and there wilfully [sic], unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of
the herein offended party REGINA GUAFIN, 11 years old, the accused is the
live-in partner of her grandmother with whom she is living with [sic], against
her will and without her consent, with the use of a knife, mashed her breast,
embraced, kissed and inserted his penis over the victimâs genital organ to
accomplish his lewd design, to her damage and prejudice.â


During his
arraignment, appellant, assisted by Counsel 
de Oficio 
Wenceslao Vanilla
of the Public Attorneyâs Office, pleaded not guilty.
[2]
 
Thereafter, the cases were tried jointly.  In his Decision,
[3]
 the trial judge
[4]
 
disposed of the cases as follows:


â1.  In Criminal Case No. 4627-0 finding the accused Alejandro Atop
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE defined and penalized under Article 335
of the Revised Penal Code.  Appreciating
the aggravating circumstances of relationship and nighttime with no mitigating
circumstance to offset any of the two, this court imposes upon the said
ALEJANDRO ATOP the sentence of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
 and to indemnify
Regina Guafin the sum of THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (
P
30,000.00) and to pay
the costs.


2.  In Criminal Case No. 4628-0 finding the accused Alejandro Atop GUILTY
beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE defined and penalized under Article 335 of the
Revised Penal Code.  Appreciating the
aggravating circumstances of relationship and nighttime with no mitigating
circumstance to offset any of the two, this court imposes upon the said ALEJANDRO
ATOP the sentence of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
 and to indemnify Regina Guafin
the sum of THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (
P
30,000.00) and to pay the costs.


3.  In Criminal Case No. 4630-0 finding the accused Alejandro Atop NOT
GUILTY for insufficiency of evidence.


4.  In Criminal Case No. 4629-0 finding the accused ALEJANDRO ATOP guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659.  Appreciating the aggravating circumstances of relationship and nighttime
with no mitigating circumstance to offset any of the two, this court imposes
upon the said ALEJANDRO ATOP, also known as âAliâ, the sentence of DEATH.  Further, the same Alejandro Atop is directed
to indemnify Regina Guafin the sum of THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (
P
30,000.00)
as moral damages and to pay the costs.


By reason of the
imposition of two reclusion perpetua and of the death penalties the jail warden
is directed to immediately commit the person of Alejandro Atop to the National
Penitentiary at Muntinlupa, Metro Manila while awaiting the review by the
Supreme Court of this decision.â
[5]


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


The
prosecutionâs evidence is narrated by the trial court
 
[6]
 
as follows:


âPrivate complainant Regina Guafin,
told the court that she is a granddaughter of Trinidad Mejos and that the
accused Alejandro Atop is the common law husband of said Trinidad Atop
[sic].  Her mother is a daughter of said
Trinidad Atop [sic] and lives in Pangasinan.  She is an illegitimate child and she does not even know her father.  Since her early childhood she stayed with
her grandmother Trinidad Atop [sic] and the accused at Barangay Santa Rosa,
Matag-ob, Leyte.  Sometime in 1991 when
she was already 10 years of age the accused started having lustful desire on
her.  The accused then inserted his
finger into her vagina.  She told her
grandmother about this but her grandmother did not believe her.  She was then told by her grandmother,
Trinidad Mejos, that what her grandfather did to her was just a manifestation
of fatherly concern.  She continued
staying with her grandmother and her common law husband Alejandro Atop, the
herein accused.


On October 9, 1992, she was called
by the accused Alejandro Atop to do something for him.  When she approached him the accused rushed
towards her, removed her panty and inserted his male organ into her
vagina.  She was not able to do anything
to resist him because the accused gagged her mouth and was carrying a knife
with him.  She was then 12 years old
when the first rape was committed to her and at that time her grandmother was
then attending a delivery since her grandmother was a âhilotâ.  When her grandmother returned home she told
her what the accused did to her but her grandmother, again, refused to believe
her.  She also remember [sic] of another
incident wherein she was raped again by the accused Alejandro Atop.  It was in the year 1993 but she could not
recall the month when it was committed.  Only she and the accused were then at their house at Barangay Santa
Rosa, Matag-ob, Leyte as her grandmother was at San Vicente attending to a
delivery.  Again, she told her
grandmother about the heinous acts that the accused did to her but her Lola
refused to believe her.


On December 26, 1994, the accused
again raped her.  She could not ask for
help because her mouth was gagged by the accused.  Aside from gagging her, the accused also carried a knife which he
placed at his side.


On December 31, 1994, while she
together with her Aunt Gloria Montealto and her two (2) nieces Rubilen and Jubilen
Atop were about to go to sleep, she noticed that the accused was looking for
her.  Upon seeing her the accused rushed
towards her and was about to lay on top of her.  She kicked him.  After
that, the accused caressed and touched his nieces but his nieces also kicked
him.  Thereafter, the accused stopped
molesting her and his nieces and went to sleep instead.  In the following morning, January 1, 1995,
she went to the barrio to go to school.  She then forgot that there were no classes.  She was not able to get a ride towards the school, so she went
directly to the house of her grandfather Zacarias Geva.  While she was at the house of her Lolo Geva,
the accused arrived and immediately entered the house of her grandfather.  The accused was met by Rubilen Atop who was
about to box him but they immediately went out of the house and the accused
followed them.  The accused wanted to
bring her back to their house but she refused.  So, the accused pulled her.  The
accused kept on holding her until they reached the waiting shed were the
accused smashed her to the concrete wall.


She reported the incidents of rape
that happened in 1992, 1993 and 1994 only in January 1995.  It took her so long to report the said
incidents because she was afraid.  The
accused threatened to kill her should she tell anybody about the
incidents.  She was accompanied by her
Aunts Fe Decio and Rosenda Andales in reporting the said incidents to the
police.  Her statement was taken by the
police at the police headquarters.  Thereafter, she filed a complaint with the Municipal Trial Judge of
Matag-ob, Leyte.  x x x  In her sworn statement which was also marked
as Exhibit â1â for the defense, she only stated therein that what was inserted
into her vagina on July 1991 was only the finger of the accused.  Out of fear, she deliberately concealed from
the investigator what actually had happened to her because at that time,
because the accused was not yet apprehended and she was afraid that the accused
would kill her.  Then she filed
complaints with the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor and requested the
fiscal to make a re-investigation in these cases.  She told the Fiscal the truth of what was done to her by the
accused because at that time the accused was already arrested.  x x x

Another prosecution witness Fe
Decio, an aunt of the private offended party Regina Guafin, testified that she
knows the accused Alejandro Atop, the latter being her stepfather.  She pointed in court the said accused.  She testified also that when her niece
Regina Guafin went to her residence at Himarco, Palompon, Leyte on January 2,
1995, she noticed that Regina Guafin had abrasions on her body and was then
crying.  She asked her the reason why
she cried and Regina told her that on January 1, 1995 the accused again tried
to rape her but did not succeed because she fought back and was able to
resist.  The abrasions in her body was
the result of the maltreatments made by the accused who forcibly pulled her
back to their house.  Further, Regina
told her that the said accused Alejandro Atop had raped her 3 to 4 times.  She was told by Regina when the said
incidents happened but she forgot the actual dates that the latter told to
her.  She accompanied Regina to the
police authorities of Matag-ob, Leyte and reported the said incidents.  During the time that Regina was investigated
by the police authorities, the accused had also fled.  Thereafter, she submitted Regina for a medical examination at the
Ormoc District Hospital.  Then, Regina
Guafin filed a complaint at the MCTC of Matag-ob, Leyte.


On cross
examination, she testified that they offer no objection with the relationship
of the accused to her mother.  In fact
during the time that the accused and her mother were living together, they were
in good terms with the accused.  She
denied the fact of sending her mother to Manila for the purpose of separating
her from the accused Alejandro Atop because it was only the decision of her
mother to have a vacation in Manila.  She testified also that the age of her mother is more than 50 years
old.â 
[7]


The third
prosecution witness, Dr. Judith V. Lomocso who was a resident gynecologist at
the Ormoc District Hospital, testified that she examined Regina Guafin.  Her findings were reduced in writing, as
follows:


âExternal Findings:


1.  Incised
wound with scab formation (L) middle finger.


2.  Tenderness (L) breast.


OB-Gyne Findings:


External genetalia [sic]  -  grossly normal


  -  negative pubic hair


  Vaginal canal  -  admits 2 fingers with ease


  hymen  -  healed laceration


  uterus  -  small


  LMP  -  December 4, 1994â
[8]


Version of the Defense


Appellant denied
the accusations of Guafin and imputed ill motive  upon  her  aunts,  who  were  the  daughters of his live-in partner.
[9]
 The trial court summed up his
testimony this wise:


âAccused Alejandro Atop [then 37
years old] testified that he and Trinidad Mejos had been living together as
husband and wife for about 10 years already.  When they started living together, Trinidad Mejos was already a widow
with eight (8) children of her previous marriage.  When he started to live with Trinidad Mejos the latterâs children
became mad at him because their mother was already old and he was still
young.  He personally knew Regina
Guafin, the latter being their adopted child.  Regina Guafin was still 2 years old when he and his wife took care of
her.  That Regina Guafin continuously
resided at Sta. Rosa, Matag-ob, Leyte.  The other persons who also lived with them aside from Regina Guafin,
were the three sons of Trinidad and his two (2) nieces whom he took from Butuan
City and sent them to school.  He denied
committing rape against Regina Guafin on October 9, 1992, in the year 1993 and
on December 26, 1994.  On December 31,
1994, while he was at his house, Regina went to the barrio proper to go to
school.  In the afternoon of the same
date, he went to fetch Regina Guafin because at that time classes were not
regular yet.  At that time, the
companions of Regina were Jovelyn and Rubilyn.  He also denied committing an offense against Regina Guafin on December
31, 1994.  He testified also that he did
not evade arrest by going out of Matag-ob, Leyte because during that time he
was working in Hideco as a laborer.  The
reason why Regina Guafin filed a case against him because the said private
complainant was coached by her aunt who wanted him and his wife Trinidad to be
separated.


On cross
examination, he testified also that he was told by his cousin Nicolas Valencia
that her [sic] wife Trinidad was prevented by her children from visiting him in
jail upon her arrival from Manila.â
[10]


Ruling of the Trial Court


The court 
a
quo 
evaluated the testimony of the offended party in this manner:


âx x
x  this court observed both the
complainant and the accused when both were on the witness stand.  The tears that spontaneously flowed from the
private complainantâs eyes and the sobs that punctuated complainantâs testimony
when asked about her experience with the accused eloquently conveyed the hurt,
the pain, and the anguish the private complainant has suffered and lived with
during all the years.  When she told the
court that she was raped by the accused she said it all with candor.  The mixed expression of sadness and anger
shown in the private complainantâs face during her testimony convinced this
court that she was telling the truth.  This court then found nothing in the evidence which would indicate in
any way that the said Regina Guafin was motivated in narrating to the court her
ordeal other than her quest for justice.  The defenseâs claim that Regina was coached by her aunts to fabricate
her rape story in order to force their mother Trinidad Mejos to separate from
the accused is nothing but a mere speculation [upon] which this court found no
probative value.  This court then gives
the testimony of the private offended party full faith and credit.â
[11]


The trial court
also ruled that the circumstances of nighttime and relationship aggravated all
the three incidents of rape, but that there was no sufficient evidence proving
attempted rape on December 31, 1994.  Considering that the last rape occurred after the effectivity of RA
7659, the death penalty law, the court meted out the capital punishment to
accused-appellant.


Issues


In his appeal
[12]
 
before us, appellant assigns the following errors:
[13]


âI.
        
The
trial court erred in appreciating the circumstances of nighttime and
relationship as aggravating the penalty imposable for the rape allegedly
committed on October 9, 1992, in 1993 and on December 26, 1994.


âII.
       
The trial court erred in finding accused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crimes charged.â


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
partly meritorious.  We find that the
alleged aggravating circumstances were not duly proved.


First Issue:  
Nighttime
and Relationship


The
time-settled rule is that nocturnity, as an aggravating circumstance, must have
been deliberately sought by the offender to facilitate the crime or prevent its
discovery or evade his capture or facilitate his escape.
[14]
 
The culprit must have
purposely taken advantage of the cover of night as an indispensable factor to
attain his criminal purpose.
[15]


We find merit in
Appellant Atopâs contention, to which the solicitor general agrees, that the
prosecution failed to prove that nighttime was deliberately sought by appellant
to facilitate his dastardly acts.  In
fact, the prosecution failed to show that appellant consummated his carnal
designs at night, except only for the December 26, 1994 incident which the
victim said occurred at 11:00 p.m.
[16]
 Much less is there any evidence
substantiating the trial courtâs conclusion that appellant intentionally sought
the darkness to advance his criminal exploits.


Neither can we
appreciate relationship as an aggravating circumstance.  The scope of relationship as defined by law
encompasses (1) the spouse, (2) an ascendant, (3) a descendant, (4) a
legitimate, natural or adopted brother or sister, or (5) a relative by affinity
in the same degree.
[17]
 Relationship by affinity refers to
a relation by virtue of a legal bond such as marriage.  Relatives by affinity therefore are those
commonly referred to as âin-laws,â or stepfather, stepmother, stepchild and the
like; in contrast to relatives by consanguinity or blood relatives encompassed
under the second, third and fourth enumeration above.  The law cannot be stretched to include persons attached by
common-law relations.  Here, there is no
blood relationship or legal bond that links the appellant to his victim.  Thus, the modifying circumstance of
relationship cannot be considered against him.


Neither is the
following provision of Sec. 11, RA 7659 applicable:


âSec. 11.  Article 335 of the [Revised Penal] Code is hereby amended to read
as follows:


âx x x


The death penalty shall also be
imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant
circumstances:


1.  when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is
a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or
affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent
of the victim.


x x x
                                             
x x
x
                                     
x x
x


Undisputed is
the fact that appellant is not the common law spouse of the 
parent
 of
the victim.  He is the common law
husband of the girlâs 
grandmother
.  Needless to state, neither is appellant the victimâs âparent, ascendant,
step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third
civil degree.â  Hence, he is not
encompassed in any of the relationships expressly enumerated in the aforecited
provision.


It is a basic
rule of statutory construction that penal statutes are to be liberally
construed in favor of the accused.
[18]
 Courts must not bring cases within
the provision of a law which are not clearly embraced by it.  No act can be pronounced criminal which is
not clearly made so by statute; so, too, no person who is not clearly within
the terms of a statute can be brought within them.
[19]
 
Any reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the
accused.
[20]


Second Issue:  
Sufficiency
of Prosecution Evidence


However, we do
not agree with the claim of appellant that the prosecution evidence was not
sufficient to prove his guilt.  In the
main, appellant relies on the disparity between, on the one hand, the
allegations of Regina in her sworn statement
[21]
 executed before MCTC Judge Aquilino
A. Inopiquez Jr. of Matag-ob, Leyte which merely prove acts of lasciviousness;
and, on the other, her testimony in court showing three counts of rape.


Such disparity,
which at first glance may raise some doubts on the truthfulness of
complainantâs statements, was cogently and satisfactorily explained by her
thus:


âQ
    
x
x x  why did you state in your affidavit
that only the finger that [sic] was inserted into your vagina?


A
     
Because
during the time of the investigation, I did not tell what was really true
because he was not yet apprehended, sir.


Q
     
So,
you deliberately conceal[ed] from the investigator what actually happened out
of fear?


A
     
Yes,
your Honor.


CONTINUE


PROSECUTOR


Q
     
And
when you appeared before the Office of the Provâl. Fiscal, were you
investigated?


A
     
Yes,
maâam.


Q
     
And
did you tell the Fiscal the truth of what had this accused done to you?


A
     
Yes,
maâam.


Q
     
And
what was that statement you have given to the Fiscal?


A
     
I
told the Fiscal the truth because the accused was already arrested.


Q
     
And
what was the truth?


A
     
The
truth that it was his penis that was inserted to my vagina.


Q
     
How
many times did the accused inserted [sic] his penis into your vagina?


A
     
Many
times maâam but I can remember only three (3) to four (4) times.


Q
     
And
the first time that [sic] was on October 9, 1992?


A
     
Yes,
maâam.


Q
     
When
was the second time he inserted his penis into your vagina?


A
     
In
the year 1993.


Q
     
And
the third time?


A
     
On December 26, 1994.â 
[22]


From the
testimony of Regina, the crimes evidently committed by appellant on the
aforestated dates were consummated rapes, not merely acts of
lasciviousness.  Initially, she
hesitated to completely divulge her ravishment by appellant because of his
threats to kill her should she tell anybody of his assaults.
[23]
 With his arrest and detention, she
mustered the courage to finally and completely reveal her embarrassing story.


No simple barrio
lass would so candidly admit before the public that a man who had lived as
common-law husband to her grandmother had inserted his penis in her vagina for
so many times in the past.  It is
unthinkable that complainant, a young lady of fifteen years, would allow her
private parts to be examined and would withstand the rigors of a public trial
-- along with the shame, humiliation and dishonor of exposing her own
mortifying defilement -- if she was not in fact ravished.  A careful examination of her testimony does
not reveal any hint of prevarication.  Rather, her straightforward and unequivocal statements, during both her
direct and her cross-examinations, show indelible badges of truth.  As the trial judge keenly observed, âThe
tears that spontaneously flowed from the private complainantâs eyes and the
sobs that punctuated [her] testimony when asked about her experience with the
accused eloquently conveyed the hurt, the pain, and the anguish the private
complainant has suffered and lived with during all the years.  When she told the court that she was raped
by the accused, she said it all with candor.  The mixed expression of sadness and anger shown in the private
complainantâs face during her testimony convinced this court that she was
telling the truth.â
[24]
 We find it apt to say once again
that when a woman, especially a minor, says that she has been raped, she says
in effect all that is necessary to show that the crime was committed.
[25]


Appellantâs
contention that private complainant was merely induced by her aunts who had
objected to his relationship with their mother, Trinidad Mejos, is a trite
defense that is completely undeserving of credit.  It is unnatural and unbelievable for Reginaâs aunts to concoct a
story of rape of their own very young niece, that would bring shame and scandal
not only to her but to the entire family, especially to their mother.  There could have been so many ways to
alienate appellant from their mother, so many crimes to impute to him without
dragging the familyâs honor into it.  The preposterousness  of  appellantâs  assertion  becomes more
obvious in light of the fact that this case was instituted only after ten (10)
years of his illegitimate union with Reginaâs grandmother.  If Reginaâs aunts truly wanted them to
discontinue such relationship, the long wait is inexplicable.


Consequently, in
the face of private complainantâs positive and unequivocal testimony,
appellantâs plain denial of the accusations against him cannot prevail.
[26]
 It is well-settled that denial, if
unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a negative self-serving
assertion which deserves no weight in law.
[27]
 The recognized rule is that
testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature are each worthy of full
credence.
[28]


Time and again,
we have also held that when the question deals with the credibility of
witnesses and their testimonies, the trial courtâs observations and conclusions
deserve great respect and are often accorded finality, unless there appears in
the record some fact or circumstance of weight which the lower court may have
overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated and which, if properly considered,
would alter the results of the case.
[29]
 The trial judge has the valuable
edge of observing the witnessâ deportment and manner of testifying, her
âfurtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering
tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oathâ
[30]
 -- all of which are useful aids for
an accurate determination of a witnessâ honesty and sincerity.  After a thorough review of all the evidence
on record, the Court finds no reason to reverse the trial courtâs findings on
the guilt of appellant.


Penalties Imposable


For the rape
incidents on October 9, 1992 and sometime in 1993, the court 
a quo 
correctly
imposed the penalty of 
reclusion  perpetua
  for each of the two
criminal acts.  The third rape incident,
however, occurred after the effectivity of RA 7659, the law which imposed the
death penalty on certain heinous crimes.  Under this amendatory law, the penalty for rape committed with the use
of a deadly weapon is 
reclusion perpetua  
to death.
[31]
 This provision is applicable in the
instant case, since private complainant was threatened with a knife when
appellant consummated his beastly acts on her.
[32]


In cases where
the penalty prescribed is composed of two indivisible penalties and there is
neither an aggravating nor a mitigating circumstance in the commission of the
felony, the lesser penalty should be applied.
[33]
 Since there was no modifying
circumstance even in the third rape, the penalty therefor should be 
reclusion  perpetua,  
not the graver penalty of death as imposed by the court 
a
quo.  
As earlier explained, the
attendant relationships enumerated under Sec. 11 of RA 7659 do not apply
either.


Consistent with
prevailing jurisprudence,
[34]
 we increase the civil indemnity
imposed upon appellant by the trial court to 
P
50,000 for each count of
rape.  The Court notes that, for
appellantâs third conviction, the trial court ordered him to indemnify the
victim in the amount of 
P
30,000 âas moral damages.â  Civil indemnity under Art. 100
[35]
 of the Revised Penal Code is
separate and distinct from moral damages under Arts. 2217 and 2219 of the Civil
Code.
[36]
 Conformably, Appellant Atop should
indemnify Regina Guafin in the total amount of 
P
150,000 for the three
counts of rape -- separately from payment of moral damages which we find
justified under the circumstances.  The
moral sufferings of private complainant were obvious during the court
proceedings where, as observed by the trial judge and also noted in the
transcripts, she spontaneously cried and sobbed, and showed a mixed expression
of sadness, pain and anger.


WHEREFORE
, the Decision appealed from is
hereby 
AFFIRMED,  
with the 
MODIFICATION

that Appellant Alejandro Atop shall not suffer the penalty of death but shall 
SERVE
  three (3) terms of 
reclusion perpetua, 
one
for each of the three (3) counts of rape for which he was found GUILTY by the
trial court, and is ordered to 
PAY
  Regina Guafin indemnity in the amount of 
P
150,000 plus moral
damages of 
P
50,000
.


SO ORDERED.

The 14-page appellantâs brief, dated May 22, 1997,
prepared by the Public Attorneyâs Office summarized the evidence for the
defense (rollo, pp. 47-48) simply as follows:


âAccused denied the charges against him.  He denied committing the rape against Regina Guafin on October 9,
1992, in the year 1993 and on December 26, 1994.  He also denied committing an offense against Regina on December
31, 1994.  He suspect[ed] that Regina
was coached by her aunt in filing this complaint against him for the purpose of
separating him from his wife Trinidad.


Aside from Regina Guafin, the three sons of Trinidad and his two nieces,
Jovelyn and Rubilyn, were also living with them.â
