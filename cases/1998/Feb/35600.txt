AYALA INVESTMENT &
DEVELOPMENT CORP. AND ABELARDO MAGSAJO, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF
APPEALS AND SPOUSES ALFREDO & ENCARNACION CHING, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


Under Article
161 of the Civil Code, what debts and obligations contracted by the husband
alone are considered âfor the benefit of the conjugal partnershipâ which are
chargeable against the conjugal partnership?  Is a surety agreement or an accommodation contract entered into by the
husband in favor of his employer within the contemplation of the said
provision?


These are the
issues which we will resolve in this petition for review.  


The petitioner
assails the decision dated April 14, 1994 of the respondent Court of Appeals in
âSpouses Alfredo and Encarnacion Ching 
vs
. Ayala Investment and
Development Corporation, 
et. al.
,â docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 29632,
[1]
 upholding the decision of the
Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Branch 168, which ruled that the conjugal
partnership of gains of respondents-spouses Alfredo and Encarnacion Ching  is not liable for the payment of the debts
secured by respondent-husband Alfredo Ching.


A chronology of
the essential antecedent facts is necessary for a clear understanding of the
case at bar.


Philippine
Blooming Mills (hereinafter referred to as PBM) obtained a 
P
50,300,000.00
loan from petitioner Ayala Investment and Development Corporation (hereinafter
referred to as AIDC).  As added security
for the credit line extended to PBM, respondent Alfredo Ching, Executive Vice
President of PBM, executed security agreements on December 10, 1980 and on
March 20, 1981 making himself jointly and severally answerable with PBMâs indebtedness
to AIDC.


PBM failed to
pay the loan.  Thus, on July 30, 1981,
AIDC filed a case for sum of money against PBM and respondent-husband Alfredo
Ching with the then Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasig), Branch VIII,
entitled âAyala Investment and Development Corporation 
vs.
 Philippine
Blooming Mills and Alfredo Ching,â docketed as Civil Case No. 42228.


After trial, the
court rendered judgment ordering PBM and respondent-husband Alfredo Ching to
jointly and severally pay AIDC the principal amount of 
P
50,300,000.00
with interests.


Pending appeal
of the judgment in Civil Case No. 42228, upon motion of AIDC, the lower court
issued a writ of execution pending appeal. Upon AIDCâs putting up of an 
P
8,000,000.00
bond, a writ of execution dated May 12, 1982 was issued.  Thereafter, petitioner Abelardo Magsajo,
Sr., Deputy Sheriff of Rizal and appointed sheriff in Civil Case No. 42228,
caused the issuance and service upon respondents-spouses of a notice of sheriff
sale dated May 20, 1982 on three (3) of their conjugal properties.  Petitioner Magsajo then scheduled the
auction sale of the properties levied. 


On June 9, 1982,
private respondents filed a case of injunction against petitioners with the
then Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasig), Branch XIII, to enjoin the
auction sale alleging that petitioners cannot enforce the judgment against the
conjugal partnership levied on the ground that, among others, the subject loan
did not redound to the benefit of the said conjugal partnership.
[2]
 Upon application of private
respondents, the lower court issued a temporary restraining order to prevent
petitioner Magsajo from proceeding with the enforcement of the writ of
execution and with the sale of the said properties at public auction.


AIDC filed a
petition for 
certiorari
 before the Court of Appeals,
[3]
 questioning the order of the lower
court enjoining the sale.  Respondent
Court of Appeals issued a Temporary Restraining Order on June 25, 1982,
enjoining the lower court
[4]
 from enforcing its Order of June
14, 1982, thus paving the way for the scheduled auction sale of
respondents-spouses conjugal properties.


On June 25,
1982, the auction sale took place.  AIDC
being the only bidder, was issued a Certificate of Sale by petitioner Magsajo,
which was registered on July 2, 1982. Upon expiration of the redemption period,
petitioner sheriff issued the final deed of sale on August 4, 1982 which was
registered on August 9, 1983.


In the meantime,
the respondent court, on August 4, 1982, decided CA-G.R. SP No. 14404, in this
manner:


âWHEREFORE, the petition
for 
certiorari
 in this case is granted and the challenged order of the
respondent Judge dated June 14, 1982 in Civil Case No. 46309 is hereby set
aside and nullified.  The same petition
insofar as it seeks to enjoin the respondent Judge from proceeding with Civil
Case No. 46309 is, however, denied.  No
pronouncement is here made as to costs.  x x x x.â
[5]


On September 3,
1983, AIDC filed a motion to dismiss the petition for injunction filed before
Branch XIII of the CFI of Rizal (Pasig) on the ground that the same had become
moot and academic with the consummation of the sale.  Respondents filed their opposition to the motion arguing, among
others, that where a third party who claims ownership of the property attached
or levied upon, a different legal situation is presented; and that in this
case, two (2) of the real properties are actually in the name of Encarnacion
Ching, a non-party to Civil Case No. 42228.


The lower court
denied the motion to dismiss.  Hence,
trial on the merits proceeded.  Private
respondents presented several witnesses.  On the other hand, petitioners did not present any evidence. 


On September 18,
1991, the trial court promulgated its decision declaring the sale on execution
null and void.  Petitioners appealed to
the respondent court, which was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 29632.


On April 14,
1994, the respondent court promulgated the assailed decision, affirming the
decision of the regional trial court.  It held that:


âThe loan procured from
respondent-appellant AIDC was for the advancement and benefit of Philippine
Blooming Mills and not for the benefit of the conjugal partnership of
petitioners-appellees.

As to the applicable law,
whether it is Article 161 of the New Civil Code or Article 1211 of the Family
Code-suffice it to say that the two provisions are substantially the same.  Nevertheless, We agree with the trial court
that the Family Code is the applicable law on the matter  x x x x x x.


Article 121 of the Family
Code provides that âThe conjugal partnership shall be liable for: x x x (2) All
debts and obligations contracted during the marriage by the designated
Administrator-Spouse for the benefit of the conjugal partnership of gains x x x.â  The burden of proof that the debt was
contracted for the benefit of the conjugal partnership of gains, lies with the
creditor-party litigant claiming as such.  In the case at bar, respondent-appellant AIDC failed to prove that the
debt was contracted by appellee-husband, for the benefit of the conjugal
partnership of gains.â


The dispositive
portion of the decision reads:


âWHEREFORE,
in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the
appeal.  The decision of the Regional
Trial Court is AFFIRMED 
in toto
.â
[6]


Petitioner filed
a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied by the respondent court in a
Resolution dated November 28, 1994.
[7]


Hence, this
petition for review.  Petitioner
contends that the ârespondent court erred in ruling that the conjugal
partnership of private respondents is not liable for the obligation by the
respondent-husband.â


Specifically,
the errors allegedly committed by the respondent court are as follows:


âI.
  
RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE OBLIGATION INCURRED BY
RESPONDENT HUSBAND DID NOT REDOUND TO THE BENEFIT OF THE CONJUGAL PARTNERSHIP
OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT.


II
    
RESPONDENT
COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE ACT OF RESPONDENT HUSBAND IN SECURING THE
SUBJECT LOAN IS NOT PART OF HIS INDUSTRY, BUSINESS OR CAREER FROM WHICH HE
SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY.â


Petitioners in
their appeal point out that there is no need to prove that actual benefit
redounded to the benefit of the partnership; all that is necessary, they say,
is that the transaction was entered into for the benefit of the conjugal
partnership.  Thus, petitioners aver
that:


âThe wordings of Article
161 of the Civil Code is very clear:  for the partnership to be held liable, the husband must have contracted
the debt âfor the benefit ofâ the partnership, thus:


âArt.
161.  The conjugal partnership shall be
liable for:


1) 
   
all debts and obligations contracted by the
husband for the benefit of the conjugal partnership x x x.â


There
is a difference between the phrases: âredounded to the benefit ofâ or
âbenefited fromâ (on the one hand) and âfor the benefit ofâ (on the
other).  The former require that actual
benefit must have been realized; the latter requires only that the transaction
should be one which normally would produce benefit to the partnership,
regardless of whether or not actual benefit accrued.â
[8]


We do not agree
with petitioners that there is a difference between the terms âredounded to the
benefit ofâ or âbenefited fromâ on the one hand; and âfor the benefit ofâ on
the other.  They mean one and the same
thing.  Article 161 (1) of the Civil
Code and Article 121 (2) of the Family Code are similarly worded, i.e., both
use the term âfor the benefit of.â  On
the other hand, Article 122 of the Family Code provides that âThe payment of
personal debts by the husband or the wife before or during the marriage shall
not be charged to the conjugal partnership except insofar as 
they redounded
to the benefit of the family
.â  As
can be seen, the terms are used interchangeably. 


Petitioners
further contend that the ruling of the respondent court runs counter to the
pronouncement of this Court in the case of Cobb-Perez 
vs
. Lantin,
[9]
 that the husband as head of the
family and as administrator of the conjugal partnership is presumed to have
contracted obligations for the benefit of the family or the conjugal
partnership.


Contrary to the
contention of the petitioners, the case of Cobb-Perez is not applicable in the
case at bar.  This Court has, on several
instances, interpreted the term âfor the benefit of the conjugal partnership.â


In the cases of
Javier 
vs.
 OsmeÃ±a,
[10]
 Abella de Diaz 
vs
. Erlanger
& Galinger, Inc.,
[11]
 Cobb-Perez 
vs
. Lantin
[12]
 and G-Tractors, Inc. 
vs
.
Court of Appeals,
[13]
 cited by the petitioners, we held
that:


âThe debts contracted by the
husband during the marriage relation, for and in the exercise of the industry
or profession by which he contributes toward the support of his family, are not
his personal and private debts, and the products or income from the wifeâs own
property, which, like those of her husbandâs, are liable for the payment of the
marriage expenses, cannot be excepted from the payment of such debts.â (Javier)


âThe husband, as the
manager of the partnership (Article 1412, Civil Code), has a right to embark
the partnership in an ordinary commercial enterprise for gain, and the fact
that the wife may not approve of a venture does not make it a private and
personal one of the husband.â (Abella de Diaz)


âDebts contracted by the
husband for and in the exercise of the industry or profession by which he
contributes to the support of the family, cannot be deemed to be his exclusive
and private debts.â (Cobb-Perez) 


âx x x if he incurs an
indebtedness in the legitimate pursuit of his career or profession or suffers
losses in a legitimate business, the conjugal partnership must equally bear the
indebtedness and the losses, unless he deliberately acted to the prejudice of
his family.â (G-Tractors)


However, in the
cases of Ansaldo 
vs
. Sheriff of Manila, Fidelity Insurance & Luzon
Insurance Co.,
[14]
 Liberty Insurance Corporation 
vs
.
Banuelos,
[15]
 and Luzon Surety Inc. 
vs
. De
Garcia,
[16]
 cited by the respondents, we ruled
that:


âThe fruits of the
paraphernal property which form part of the assets of the conjugal partnership,
are subject to the payment of the debts and expenses of the spouses, but not to
the payment of the personal obligations (guaranty agreements) of the husband,
unless it be proved that such obligations were productive of some benefit to
the family.â (Ansaldo; parenthetical phrase ours.)


âWhen there is no showing
that the execution of an indemnity agreement by the husband redounded to the
benefit of his family, the undertaking is not a conjugal debt but an obligation
personal to him.â (Liberty Insurance)


âIn the most categorical language,
a conjugal partnership under Article 161 of the new Civil Code is liable only
for such âdebts and obligations contracted by the husband for the benefit of
the conjugal partnership.â  There must
be the requisite showing then of some advantage which clearly accrued to the
welfare of the spouses.  Certainly, to
make a conjugal partnership respond for a liability that should appertain to
the husband alone is to defeat and frustrate the avowed objective of the new
Civil Code to show the utmost concern for the solidarity and well-being of the
family as a unit.  The husband,
therefore, is denied the power to assume unnecessary and unwarranted risks to
the financial stability of the conjugal partnership.â (Luzon Surety, Inc.)


From the foregoing
jurisprudential rulings of this Court, we can derive the following conclusions:


(A) If the husband himself is the
principal obligor in the contract, i.e., he directly received the money and
services to be used in or for his own business or his own profession, that
contract falls within the term âx x x x obligations for the benefit of the
conjugal partnership.â  Here, no actual
benefit may be proved.  It is enough
that the benefit to the family is apparent at the time of the signing of the
contract.  From the very nature of the
contract of loan or services, the family stands to benefit from the loan
facility or services to be rendered to the business or profession of the
husband.  It is immaterial, if in the
end, his business or profession fails or does not succeed.  Simply stated, where the husband contracts
obligations on behalf of the family business, the law presumes, and rightly so,
that such obligation will redound to the benefit of the conjugal partnership.


(B) On the other hand, if the money
or services are given to another person or entity, and the husband acted only
as a 
surety
 or 
guarantor
, that contract cannot, by itself, alone
be categorized as falling within the context of âobligations for the benefit of
the conjugal partnership.â  The contract
of loan or services is clearly for the benefit of the principal debtor and not
for the surety or his family.  No
presumption can be inferred that, when a husband enters into a contract of
surety or accommodation agreement, it is âfor the benefit of the conjugal
partnership.â  Proof must be presented
to establish benefit redounding to the conjugal partnership.  


Thus, the
distinction between the Cobb-Perez case, and we add, that of  the three other companion cases, on the one
hand, and that of Ansaldo, Liberty Insurance and Luzon Surety, is that in the
former, the husband contracted the obligation for his own business; while in
the latter, the husband merely acted as a surety for the loan contracted by
another for the latterâs business.


The evidence of
petitioner indubitably show that co-respondent Alfredo Ching signed as surety
for the 
P
50M loan contracted on behalf of PBM.  Petitioner should have adduced evidence to prove that Alfredo
Chingâs acting as surety redounded to the benefit of the conjugal partnership.  The reason for this is as lucidly explained
by the respondent court:


âThe loan procured from
respondent-appellant AIDC was for the advancement and benefit of Philippine
Blooming Mills and not for the benefit of the conjugal partnership of petitioners-appellees.  Philippine Blooming Mills has a personality
distinct and separate from the family of petitioners-appellees - this despite
the fact that the members of the said family happened to be stockholders of said
corporate entity.â


x x x

x
                                     
x x

x
x x.  The burden of proof that the debt
was contracted for the benefit of the conjugal partnership of gains, lies with
the creditor-party litigant claiming as such.  In the case at bar, respondent-appellant AIDC failed to prove that the
debt was contracted by appellee-husband, for the benefit of the conjugal
partnership of gains.  What is apparent
from the facts of the case is that the judgment debt was contracted by or in
the name of the Corporation Philippine Blooming Mills and appellee-husband only
signed as surety thereof. The debt is clearly a corporate debt and
respondent-appellantâs right of recourse against appellee-husband as surety is
only to the extent of his corporate stockholdings.  It does not extend to the conjugal partnership of gains of the
family of petitioners-appellees.  x x
x  x x x.â 
[17]


Petitioners
contend that no actual benefit need accrue to the conjugal partnership.  To support this contention, they cite
Justice J.B.L. Reyesâ authoritative opinion in the Luzon Surety Company case:


âI concur in the result,
but would like to make of record that, in my opinion, the words âall debts and
obligations contracted by the husband for the benefit of the conjugal
partnershipâ used in Article 161 of the Civil Code of the Philippines in describing
the charges and obligations for which the conjugal partnership is liable do not
require that actual profit or benefit must accrue to the conjugal partnership
from the husbandâs transaction; but it suffices that the transaction should be
one that normally would produce such benefit for the partnership.  This is the ratio behind our ruling in
Javier 
vs
. OsmeÃ±a, 34 Phil. 336, that obligations incurred by the
husband in the practice of his profession are collectible from the conjugal
partnership.â


The aforequoted
concurring opinion agreed with the majority decision that the conjugal
partnership should not be made liable for the surety agreement which was
clearly for the benefit of a third party.  Such opinion merely registered an exception to what may be construed as
a sweeping statement that in all cases actual profit or benefit must accrue to
the conjugal partnership.  The opinion
merely made it clear that no actual benefits to the family need be proved in
some cases such as in the Javier case.  There, the husband was the principal obligor himself.  Thus, said transaction was found to be âone
that would normally produce x x x benefit for the partnership.â  In the later case of G-Tractors, Inc., the
husband was also the principal obligor - not merely the surety.  This latter case, therefore, did not create
any precedent.  It did not also
supersede the Luzon Surety Company case, nor any of the previous accommodation
contract cases, where this Court ruled that they were for the benefit of third
parties.


But it could be
argued, as the petitioner suggests, that even in such kind of contract of
accommodation, a benefit for the family may also result, 
when the guarantee
is in favor of the husbandâs employer
.


In the case at
bar, petitioner claims that the benefits the respondent family would reasonably
anticipate were the following:


(a)
      
The employment of co-respondent Alfredo Ching would be
prolonged and he would be entitled to his monthly salary of 
P
20,000.00
for an extended length of time because of the loan he guaranteed;


(b)
      
The shares of stock of the members of his family would
appreciate if the PBM could be rehabilitated through the loan obtained;


(c)
      
His prestige in the corporation would be enhanced and his
career would be boosted should PBM survive because of the loan.


However, these
are not the benefits contemplated by Article 161 of the Civil Code.  The benefits must be one directly resulting
from the loan.  It cannot merely be a
by-product or a spin-off of the loan itself.


In all our
decisions involving accommodation contracts of the husband,
[18]
 we underscored the requirement
that:  âthere must be the requisite
showing x x x of some advantage which clearly accrued to the welfare of the
spousesâ or âbenefits to his familyâ or âthat such obligations are productive
of some benefit to the family.â  Unfortunately, the petition did not present any proof to show:  (a) Whether or not the corporate existence
of PBM was prolonged and for how many months or years; and/or (b) Whether or
not the PBM was saved by the loan and its shares of stock appreciated, if so,
how much and how substantial was the holdings of the Ching family.


Such benefits
(prospects of longer employment and probable increase in the value of stocks)
might have been already apparent or could be anticipated at the time the
accommodation agreement was entered into.  But would those âbenefitsâ qualify the transaction as one of the
âobligations x x x for the benefit of the conjugal partnershipâ? Are indirect
and remote probable benefits, the ones referred to in Article 161 of the Civil
Code?  The Court of Appeals in denying
the motion for reconsideration, disposed of these questions in the following
manner:


âNo matter how one looks at
it, the debt/credit extended by respondents-appellants is purely a corporate debt
granted to PBM, with petitioner-appellee-husband merely signing as surety.  While such petitioner-appellee-husband, as
such surety, is solidarily liable with the principal debtor AIDC, such
liability under the Civil Code provisions is specifically restricted by Article
122 (par. 1) of the Family Code, so that debts for which the husband is liable
may not be charged against conjugal partnership properties.  Article 122 of the Family Code is explicit â
âThe payment of personal debts contracted by the husband or the wife before or
during the marriage shall not be charged to the conjugal partnership except
insofar as they redounded to the benefit of the family.â


Respondents-appellants
insist that the corporate debt in question falls under the exception laid down
in said Article 122 (par. one).  We do
not agree.  The loan procured from
respondent-appellant AIDC was for the sole advancement and benefit of
Philippine Blooming Mills and not for the benefit of the conjugal partnership
of petitioners-appellees.


x
x x appellee-husband derives salaries, dividends benefits from Philippine
Blooming  Mills (the debtor
corporation), only because said husband is an employee of said PBM.  These salaries and benefits, are not the
âbenefitsâ contemplated by Articles 121 and 122 of the Family Code.  The âbenefitsâ contemplated by the exception
in Article 122 (Family Code) is that benefit derived directly from the use of
the loan.  In the case at bar, the loan
is a corporate loan extended to PBM and used by PBM itself, not by petitioner-appellee-husband
or his family.  The alleged benefit, if
any, continuously harped by respondents-appellants, are not only incidental but
also speculative.â
[19]


We agree with
the respondent court.  Indeed,
considering the odds involved in guaranteeing a large amount (
P
50,000,000.00)
of loan, the probable prolongation of employment in PBM and increase in value
of its stocks, would be too small to qualify the transaction as one âfor the
benefitâ of the suretyâs family.  Verily, no one could say, with a degree of certainty, that the said
contract is even âproductive of some benefitsâ to the conjugal partnership.


We likewise
agree with the respondent court (and this view is not contested by the
petitioners) that the provisions of the Family Code is applicable in this case.
These provisions highlight the underlying concern of the law for the
conservation of the conjugal partnership; for the husbandâs duty to protect and
safeguard, if not augment, not to dissipate it.


This is the
underlying reason why the Family Code clarifies that the obligations entered
into by one of the spouses must be those that redounded to the benefit of the
family and that the measure of the partnershipâs liability is to âthe extent
that the family is benefited.â
[20]


These are all in
keeping with the spirit and intent of the other provisions of the Civil Code
which prohibits any of the spouses to donate or convey gratuitously any part of
the conjugal property.
[21]
 Thus, when co-respondent Alfredo
Ching entered into a surety agreement he, from then on, definitely put in peril
the conjugal property (in this case, including the family home) and placed it
in danger of being taken gratuitously as in cases of donation.  


In the second
assignment of error, the petitioner advances the view that acting as surety is
part of the business or profession of the respondent-husband.


This theory is
new as it is novel.


The respondent
court correctly observed that:


âSigning as a surety is  certainly
not an exercise of an industry or profession, hence the cited cases of
Cobb-Perez vs. Lantin;  Abella de Diaz
vs. Erlanger & Galinger; G-Tractors, Inc. vs. CA do not apply in the
instant case.  Signing as a surety is
not embarking in a business.â
[22]


We are likewise of the view
that no matter how often an executive acted or was persuaded to act, as a
surety for his own employer, this should not be taken to mean that he had
thereby embarked in the business of suretyship or guaranty.


This is not to
say, however, that we are unaware that executives are often asked to stand as
surety for their companyâs loan obligations.  This is especially true if the corporate officials have sufficient
property of their own; otherwise, their spousesâ signatures are required in
order to bind the conjugal partnerships.


The fact that on
several occasions the lending institutions did not require the signature of the
wife and the husband signed alone does not mean that being a surety became part
of his profession.  Neither could he be
presumed to have acted for the conjugal partnership.


Article 121,
paragraph 3, of the Family Code is emphatic that the payment of personal debts
contracted by the husband or the wife before or during the marriage shall not
be charged to the conjugal partnership except to the extent that they redounded
to the benefit of the family.


Here, the
property in dispute also involves the family home.  The loan is a corporate loan not a personal one.  Signing as a surety is certainly not an
exercise of an industry or profession nor an act of administration for the
benefit of the family.


On the basis of
the facts, the rules, the law and equity, the assailed decision should be
upheld as we now uphold it.  This is, of
course, without prejudice to petitionerâs right to enforce the obligation in
its favor against the PBM receiver in accordance with the rehabilitation
program and payment schedule approved or to be approved by the Securities &
Exchange Commission.
