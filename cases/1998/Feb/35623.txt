[ G.R. No. 123944, February 12, 1998 ]


SGS FAR EAST LTD., NEIL TOVEY
AND RAMON GO, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS OPERATIONS MANAGER AND ADMINISTRATIVE
MANAGER, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC),
PHILIPPINE SOCIAL SECURITY LABOR UNIONS-FED (PSSLU) AND ITS FOUR MEMBERS
CRISANTO ORTIZ, MAURICIO FORBES, JR., ARTURO GALLARDO AND TONY LIM, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


Before us is a
petition for 
certiorari
 and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of
Court to set aside two (2) Resolutions issued by public respondent National
Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) denying petitioners' appeal
[1]
 and motion for reconsideration
[2]
.


It appears that
on February 2, 1982, a complaint for underpayment of wages and violation of
labor standard laws, docketed as NLRC Case No. NCR-2-2095-82, was filed by
private respondent Philippine Social Security Labor Union Federation (PSSLU)
and thirteen (13) of its members.  On
August 4, 1982, the case was amicably settled when the parties executed a
compromise agreement, viz:
[3]


"1)
     
The EMPLOYER hereby affirms the status of
the thirteen (13) individual complainants in the aforementioned case, namely,
Joseph Valerio, Delfin Bragais, Rodolfo Fermin, Antonio Lim, Arturo Gallardo,
Crisanto Ortiz, Manuel Alcera, Alexander Fernandez, Mauricio Forbes, Jr.,
Rogelio Santero, Arminio Malawig, Melvin Santero and Antonio Santero, as
regular seasonal daily-paid employees. 


"2)
     
The EMPLOYER shall pay the aforesaid
thirteen (13) complainants the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS  (
P
50,000.00) in full and complete
settlement of all money claims in the aforementioned labor case, said amount to
be paid in two equal installments: the first to be paid upon the execution of
this agreement and the final payment fifteen (15) days thereafter or on August
19, 1982. 


"3)
     
There shall be no change in the terms and
conditions governing the employment of all the 13 complainants in this case.


"4)
     
The employer undertakes to comply with all
the requirements of law with respect to terms and conditions of employment
which are now or hereafter may be legislated in so far as the same are
applicable to the aforesaid individual complainants.


"5) 
    
The employer manifests that the individual
complainants, if qualified, shall be given priority in hiring the moment a
vacancy or vacancies occur in its Manila Office for regular monthly-paid field
employees.


"6)
     
The COMPLAINANTS and the EMPLOYER shall
file a Joint Motion to dismiss in the aforementioned labor case together with a
Release, Waiver and Quitclaim to be executed by the thirteen (13) individual
complainants."


Thus, NLRC Case
No. NCR-2-2095-82 was dismissed in an order issued by Labor Arbiter Raymundo
Valenzuela dated August 24, 1982.
[4]
 The Deed of Release and Quitclaim
was executed and signed by the complainants.  Three (3) years later or on August 16, 1985, private respondents
Crisanto Ortiz, Mauricio Forbes, Jr., Tony Lim and Arturo Gallardo filed a
Manifestation and Motion before the Office of Labor Arbiter Emerson Tumanon
alleging that: (1) they were not allowed to work by SGS;
[5]
 (2) SGS has not complied with
Presidential Decrees and Wage Orders; (3) they were not given priority in
employment; and (4) SGS violated the August 4, 1982 Compromise Agreement.  Petitioner SGS filed a Motion to Dismiss
alleging that Labor Arbiter Tumanon had no jurisdiction to decide private
respondents' Motion and Manifestation which raised a cause of action not
covered by  the Compromise
Agreement.  It also alleged compliance
with the compromise agreement and labor laws governing wages.  


On February 6,
1989, Labor Arbiter Tumanon denied the Motion to dismiss and held:
[6]


"(U)nder the
circumstances, this Office has jurisdiction over this incidental case, without
the necessity as urged by respondents, of the four (4) complainants filing a
new or another case which to this Labor Arbiter, is a resort to technicality
and is abhorred by the spirit of the NLRC Rules or the New Rules of Court which
are supplementary to the former.


"WHEREFORE,
judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents to pay the four (4) individual
complainants herein their monetary claim of 
P
20,129.43 each, totalling 
P
80,517.72
as above itemized; to reinstate them with backwages for three (3) years without
deduction or qualification, based on the highest salary rate they should be
receiving or to which they were entitled as of their actual reinstatement had
they  not been discriminated against in
promotion as regular employees  and
without loss of seniority rights and other benefits nor reduction of income 
ante
litem motam
. In other words, their backwages should be based on the last
three years' salaries of employees with substantially the same length of
service who were given promotions in substantially the same positions to which
complainants should have been promoted had they not been victims of
discrimination."  


"Respondents
are likewise directed to comply strictly with the terms of the Compromise
Agreement in line with the above pronouncement, especially on matters of
promotion, there being no showing that complainants are not qualified as
regular monthly-paid employees in respondent's Manila Office.


"Ten percent
(10%) of the judgment award as attorney's fees payable by respondents is
likewise herein granted.


"SO
ORDERED."


SGS appealed to
the NLRC.  On August 8, 1991, the NLRC
reversed Labor Arbiter Tumanon and ruled that the latter had no jurisdiction to
decide private respondents' Motion and Manifestation.  It held that private respondents should  file a new case.
[7]
 Private respondents' Motion for
Reconsideration was denied on September 3, 1991.
[8]
 They then filed a Petition for
Certiorari before this Court which was docketed  as G.R. No. 101698.  On
March 23, 1994, the First Division of this Court set aside the ruling of the
NLRC and resolved that Labor Arbiter Tumanon had jurisdiction to decide the
claims of private respondents
[9]
, thus:


"There is no question that the present claims could not
possibly have accrued before the execution of the compromise agreement;
otherwise, they would have been included in the original complaint. In any
event, it is clear that the compromise agreement did not only settle the money
claims of the petitioners that had already accrued but also included
stipulations which would cover future situations. The agreement was intended to
apply also to future claims that may arise as a result of a violation of its
terms. The records show that these claims were extensively discussed in the
pleadings of the parties and were the subject of the hearings conducted by the
Labor Arbiter."


x x x.


"
WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision and Resolution of the
respondent NLRC dated August 6, 1991, and September 3, 1991, respectively, are
ANNULLED and SET ASIDE; the decision of Labor Arbiter Tumanon dated February 6,
1989, is AFFIRMED; and Labor Arbiter Tumanon is ORDERED to issue the
corresponding writ of execution in connection with NLRC Case No.
NCR-2-2045-82."
(
Emphasis supplied
)


After entry of
judgment, the case was referred to a different labor arbiter, Valentin C.
Reyes, for execution.  Labor Arbiter
Reyes required the parties to submit their respective computations of the
monetary award given in the decision of Labor Arbiter Tumanon. Private
respondents'  computation reached 
P
4,806,052.41.  The computation of petitioners merely
totalled 
P
298,552.48.
[10]


On October 18,
1994, Labor Arbiter Reyes issued his order
[11]
, to wit:


"This Office
finds without reservation the correctness and justness of the computation
submitted by the complainants which is in accord with the resolution of the
Honorable Supreme Court.  Furthermore,
considering that this case was instituted in 1984 yet issuance of corresponding
writ of execution is in order (sic).  


"WHEREFORE,
premises all considered, the amount of 
P
4,806,052.41 is hereby approved
and the corresponding writ of execution be issued.


"SO
ORDERED."


On November 21,
1994, petitioners appealed
[12]
 
the Writ of Execution to the NLRC (Second Division)
contending that:  


"a.
      
(The) Labor Arbiter Reyes erred in
ordering the payment of 
P
4,806,052.41 to complainants, as the award is
unreasonable, excessive and varied the tenor of the judgment.


"b.
      
The assailed order is appealable. 


"c.
      
The Labor Arbiter failed to carefully
study the correct individual complainants' monetary entitlement and other
matters related to the case.


"d.
      
The computation submitted by the
Socio-Economic Analyst and the respondents have been altogether salvaged for
unjustifiable reasons.


"e.
      
200% monthly basic pay for every year of
service was even awarded on top of other questionable amounts.


"f.
       
The Labor Arbiter failed to comply with
Rule VIII, Section 3 of the NLRC Rules."


On December 11,
1995, the NLRC dismissed petitioners' appeal holding, viz:
[13]


"Time and
again, the Supreme Court has succintly stated that:  An order of execution is not merely interlocutory but final in
character because its purpose is to enforce a decision on the merits rendered
in the main case. (Allied Free Workers' Union versus Estipona, L-17934,
December 28, 1961, 3 SCRA 780).


"To stay
execution of  a final and executory
judgment, a writ of preliminary injunction must be obtained.  (Service Specialists, Inc. versus Sheriff of
Manila, 145 SCRA 130).  As such, the
appeal is misplaced.  We are hard put to
find any legal basis to entertain it.


"After a
decision has become final, the prevailing party becomes entitled as a matter of
right to its execution, that it becomes merely the ministerial duty of the
court to issue the execution. (Republic versus Reyes, 71 SCRA 430).


"In the light
of the foregoing consideration, it appearing that the challenged order merely
directs the implementation of the decision of Labor Arbiter Tumanon which was
affirmed by the Supreme Court, this Commission has lost jurisdiction over the
case."


Petitioners'
Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the NLRC on January 18, 1996.
[14]


Hence, SGS
contends in this petition:


I


PUBLIC RESPONDENT
NLRC SECOND DIVISION ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF
OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN PROMULGATING ITS RESOLUTIONS DATED 11 DECEMBER
1995 AND 18 JANUARY 1996, RESPECTIVELY, THE SAME BEING IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE
EXPRESS MANDATE OF THE LAW GOVERNING THE APPELLATE JURISDICTION OF THE NATIONAL
LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION.


II


PUBLIC RESPONDENT
NLRC SECOND DIVISION ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF
OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN PROMULGATING ITS RESOLUTIONS DATED 11 DECEMBER
1995 AND 18 JANUARY 1996, RESPECTIVELY, THE SAME BEING IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE
EXPRESS MANDATE OF THE LAW GOVERNING THE WRITS OF EXECUTION AND BACKWAGES.


III


THERE IS NO APPEAL, NOR ANY PLAIN, SPEEDY AND ADEQUATE REMEDY IN THE
ORDINARY COURSE OF LAW.
[15]


In its
Manifestation and Motion (in lieu of Comment), dated September 4, 1996, the
Solicitor General conceded the correctness of the petition.


We grant the
petition.


The public
respondent gravely abused its discretion in refusing to assume jurisdiction
over the appeal of the petitioners.  Its
refusal is based on the general rule that "after a decision has become
final, the prevailing party becomes entitled as a matter of right to its
execution, that it becomes merely the ministerial duty of the court to issue
the execution."
[16]
 The general rule, however, cannot
be applied where the writ of execution is assailed as having varied the
decision.
[17]
 In the case at bar, petitioners
have vigorously assailed the correctness of the computation of arbiter
Reyes.  They also alleged it has
materially altered  the decision of
arbiter Tumanon.  Among others,
petitioners contend that: 1) the salary rate for the computation of the three
(3) years backwages should be the last salary rate received; and (2) the award
of 200% monthly basic pay for every year of service is not within the purview
of the judgment sought to be executed.  If petitioners are correct, they are entitled to the remedy of appeal to
the NLRC.
[18]
 In Bliss Development Corporation v.
NLRC
[19]
, we held that "the NLRC is
vested with authority to look into the correctness of the execution of the
decision and to consider supervening events that may affect such
execution."  We explained the
rational for the remedy in Matriguina Integrated Wood Products v. CA
[20]
, viz: "... where the execution
is not in harmony with the judgment which gives it life and exceeds it, it has 
pro
tanto
 no validity.  To maintain
otherwise would be to ignore the constitutional provision against depriving a
person of his property without due process of law."


IN VIEW
WHEREOF
, the
resolutions of the public respondent dated December 11, 1995 and January 18,
1996 are set aside and the case is remanded to the NLRC for further
proceedings.  No costs.
