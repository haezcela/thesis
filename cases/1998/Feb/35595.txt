KAPUNAN, J.:


In this petition
for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court,
petitioners assail the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 23 March 1995 in
CA-G.R. SP No. 26269 which reversed and set aside the Order of the  Securities and Exchange Commission 
en
banc
  dated 13 August 1991 in SEC-AC
No. 301. Similarly assailed in the Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 15
May 1995, denying, for lack of merit, petitionersâ motion for reconsideration.


Respondent Wack
Wack golf and Country Club ins a non-profit corporation which offers sports,
recreational and social activities to its members. Petitioner  Antonio Litonjua is an Associate Member of
said corporation and his son,  co-petitioner Arnolds Litonjua, is a Junior Member thereof. The
individual respondents are the menbers of the Board of Directors  and Membership Committee of Wack Wack.


The
misunderstanding between the petitioners and respondent corporation stemmed
from the following facts:


On 10 January 1985,
pursuant to its by-laws, respondent club posted the monthly list of delinquent
members on its premises. Included therein was petitioner Antonio Litonjua.


On 13 January
1985, after Antonio Litonjua discovered that his name was on the January 1985
deliquent list, he proceeded to the Cashierâs Office of the  club and was informed therein that the
reason behind his deliquency was his failure to pay his November 1984 dues
(which should have been paid before the end of December 1984 as provided in the
corporate by-laws). Antonio Litonjua  alleged that he was not able  to
pay his  monthly bill on time because he
has not received his statement of account for November 1984. As proof, he
presented a sealed enveloped which he allegedly presumed to be the November
1984 bill (but was actually the December 1984 statement of account) and
explained that he received it only on 12 January 1985.


A check with the
accounting office , however, revealed that the November 1984 statement of
account had already been delivered to Antonio Litonjuaâs office and was
received by his employees allegedly named âAquino.â Petitioner  asserted that he did not receive said
account and had no employee by the name of âAquino.â


Based on the
foregoing, Antonio Litonjua was able to convince the auxiliary clerks in the
Cashier's  Office to delete his name
from the list of delinquent members.  Consequently, Antonio Litonjua continued to avail of the club
facilities.


On 10 February
1985, as Anttonio Litonjua was about to tee off at the clubâs golf course, he
was informed by Mr. Ador Rallos, an employee of Wack Wack, that his name was
included in the February 1985 deliquent list. Thereupon, he paid his account by
presenting Mr. Rallos a blank check and requesting the latter to fill  in the amount of his outstanding balance
which came up to P4,784.30.


On 13 February
1985, Antonio Litonjua was advised of another outstanding balance in the amount
of P9,414.00. Again, he issued a check in payment thereof. As a result, his
name was deleted from the February 1985 list of deliquent members.


However, on the
same day Antonio Litonjua received a letter dated 9 February 1985 from the
General Manager of Wack Wack, Atty. Vicente F. Felix, informing him of the
Membership Committeeâs  decision to
suspend him for a period of sixty (60) days, effective 3 February 1985. He
allegedly  violated  Sec. 34(d) of the clubâs by-laws when he
availed of club privileges while listed as a  deliquent  member. The contents
of the suspension letter is hereunder reproduced:


February 9, 1985


Mr.
Antonio K. Litonjua


370
Aglipay Street Mandaluyong, Metro Manila


Dear Mr.
Litonjua:


I have been instructed by the
Membership Committee to advise and remind you of the following Section under
our By-Laws, to wit:


âSEC. 34(d). A member in the deliquent list who, in
violation of the rule in Section 34 (a) prohibiting deliquent members from
enjoying the privileges of the Club, proceeds to enjoy any  club privileges shall be deemed
automatically  suspended for period of
60 days from the date of the violation and if during the automatic suspension
period the again proceeds to enjoy any Club privileges the Board shall
immediately order the expulsion of said member from the Club. Payment of the
deliquent account during the suspension period shall not have the effect of
lifting said suspension.â


On 03 February, and again, on 07
February 1985, you availed or the Club food services and facilities while
listed as deliquent, in violation of the above.


In view of the foregoing, the
Membership Committee has decided and it is with regrets taht I have to inform
you of their decision to suspend you for sixty (60) days, effective as of 03
February 1985, as provided for in the applicable provision of our Club By-Laws.


With equal regrets, I must inform
you that the Club employees who were negligent in their duties by accommodating
you will also have to be penalized.


Very
truly yours,

Immediately
after receipt of the aforequoted letter, Antonio Litonjua wrote the President
of Wack Wack to explain his side and to request that the decision of the
Membership Committee be reconsidered.  The letter stated:


February
13, 1985


WACK WACK
GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB


Mandaluyong,
Metro Manila


Attention:  Mr. Ed Unson, President


Dear Sir:


This has reference to the 9
th
 February letter which I received re- 60 days
suspension issued by the Membership Committee to me and for which I would like
to clarify the events that transpired prior to my being included in the
Delinquent List for November 1984 outstanding account, for your evaluation and
reconsideration.


1.
             
Sometime last January 13
th
, I went to the club cashierâs office and presented
to Leddy and Jessie a sealed Wack Wack envelope which I presumed contained the
November statement of account.  I
advised the club cashier that same letter was delivered to my office on the 12
th
 January but my name was already posted in the
Deliquent List as of January 10.


2.
             
During my conversation with the
club cashier, I requested Leddy and Jessie to refer the matter of delayed
delivery of statements to the club General Manager to avoid repetition of
similar incident.


3.
             
On the 7
th
 of February, having received no reply to complaint,
I went back to the club cashier to inquire on the action/response of the club
administration  to matter referred.
There was no reply given and instead the same statement of account was return
to me, which I found out refers to the December  statement.


4.
             
I advised Leddy that the statement
handed to me on the 7
th
 February (Thursday) will be process the following
day (Friday) and will be ready for delivery  by the messenger on the 11
th
 February
(Monday). This was acknowledged by Leddy.


5.
             
On the 10
th
 February (Sunday), when I was about to tee-off, my
attention was called to the fact that my name is posted in the Deliquent  List. I requested an audience with your
goodself but unfortunately, you were in the Philippine Open Golf meeting.
Unable to see you, I search my wallet for a blank personal check which
fortunately I had and tendered the P4,784.30 payment for the November bills. It
was allegedly received by certain Aquino as per delivery receipt shown by Ms.
Emma Castillo but we donât have any Aquino in pour employ.


6.
             
Considering my payment on the 13
th
 of January in the amount of P9,414.18 and 10
th
 of February, my account as of today is fully paid
including the January chits, the statement of which I have not received.


In view of the foregoing, I would
like to underscore the fact that I did not receive the November statement of
account for which my name was posted in the Deliquent List and the attention of
the cashierâs office was immediately called. Although the November account was
reflected in the December statement, the same was delivered only on the 12
th
 of January and my name posted as early as January 10
th
 or 11
th
.


In the light of above
circumstances, I would like to request you and the Membership Committee to
reconsider your decision.


Trusting you will extend your
consideration on this matter.  Thank
you.


Very
truly yours,

On 18 February
1985, Antonio Litonjua received a memorandum reiterating his 60-day suspension
from âall privileges accorded (his) membership, (his) dependents and guests on
the use of the golf course and other club facilities.â
[3]
 Thus,
co-petitioner Arnold Litonjua, Antonio Litonjuaâs son, and a junior member of
the club was, likewise, prevented from enjoying the clubâs facilities.


On 25 Febraury
1985, Antonio Litonjua sent the President of Wack Wack another letter
contesting his and his sonâs suspension. He claimed that the whole affair had
caused them humiliation and thus the reserve the right to seek restitution from
Wack Wack for actual and moral damages.
[4]


On the 5 March
1985, Atty. Vicente F. Felix wrote the Board of Directors of Wack Wack the
following letter:


The Board
of Directors


Wack Wack
Golf & Country Club


Mandaluyong,
Metro Manila


Gentlemen:


On March 1, 1985, Mr. Antonio K.
Litonjua came  to my office, again
trying to thresh out and clarify the true facts that transpired, which resulted
in his  suspension  by the Membership Committee  which resulted in his suspension by the
Membership Committee which was  subsequently approved by the Board of  Directors. Attached  herewith are
his two (2) letters dated February 13 and 25, 1985, which are self-explanatory.
He requested us to conduct a more detailed  investigation on the delay in the delivery of his Statement of Account
for the month of November which was delivered and received on January 12, 1985,
per attached photocopy of the delivery receipt. he further requested for
verification on his statement that he requested  Oscar Santos to temporary delete his name from  the delinquent list. Subsequently on
February 10, 1985, he issued a blank check which he supposed was to be payment
of the account in question.


All the allegations contained  in the letter of Mr. Antonio K. Litonjua has
been verified and including Oscar Santos, Leddie Santos and Ador Rallos
affirmed to the truthfulness of such statement, when inquiries was made with
the Cashierâs Office. it was verified that Mr. Antonio K. Litonjuaâs name was
really deleted from the deliquent list of November are requested and therefore
the Club & employees could no way know that Mr. Litonjua was in deliquency.
He is requesting for reconsideration of the Boardâs decision.


Very truly yours,


(Signed) Vicente F. Felix


General Manager

On 28 March
1985, petitioners sent a letter to Wack Wack demanding restitution in the sum
of P5,000,000.00 for their âwrong and arbitrary suspension.â
[6]


When Wack Wack
failed to respond, petitioners filed a complaint with  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the
nullification of their suspension and for actual, moral and exemplary damages.


On 24 June 1985,
petitioners filed an amended complaint to include as party respondents the members
of both the Board of Directors and Membership Committee of Wack Wack.


On 26 March
1990, SEC Hearing Officer Antonio M. Esteves rendered his decision  in favor of petitioners. The dispositive
portion thus read:


WHEREFORE, finding the evidence for
the complainants preponderant, this Commission hereby declares the suspension
of complainant illegal and others respondents, jointly and severally, to pay
the complaints the sum of FOUR MILLION (P4,000,000.00) PESOS, as moral damages,
ONE HUNDRED  TEN THOUSAND (P100,000.00)
PESOS AS actual and compensatory damages and FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
(P500,000.00) PESOS as and by way of attorneyâs fees.


SO ORDERED.
[7]


Private
respondents filed a motion for reconsideration which, however, was denied in
the Order of Hearing Officer Esteves dated 31 May 1990.


Private
respondentsâ next recourse was to appeal to the SEC 
en banc. 
However,
the latter, in its Order dated  13
August 1990, affirmed the findings of Hearing Officer Esteves but reduced the
amount of damages awarded. The dispositive portion of the Order stated thus:


WHEREFORE, the Commission hereby
declares the suspension of complainant illegal and orders respondent directors,
jointly and severally, to pay the complainants the sum of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
(P100,000.00) PESOS as moral damages, TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND (P25,000.00) PESOS
by way of attorneyâs fees.


SO ORDERED.
[8]


Unfazed by their twin setbacks,
private respondents filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals
rendered its decision reversing the order of the SEC en banc and upholding the
suspension of petitioners.  The Court of
Appeals declared:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby
rendered, reversing and SETTING ASIDE the Decision of August 13, 1991 of the
SEC 
en banc
 
in SEC-AC No. 301, and Arnold Litonjua and Arnold
Lintonjua as members of the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club lawful, being in
accordance with its By-Laws.


IT IS SO ORDERED.
[9]


Petitionerâs
motion for reconsideration was denied for lack of merit  in the Court of Appealsâ resolution dated 15
May 1995.


Hence, this
petition which contains the following assignment of errors;


A


RESPONDENT CEOURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
PETITIONERS WERE VALIDLY SUSPENDED DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO THE
CONTRARY.


B


RESPENDENT COURT OF APPEAL ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER ANTONIO
LITONJUA HAD BEEN DULY SERVED WITH STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT DESPITE SUSBSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.
[10]


The  questioned that must primarily be answered
is whether or not the statement of account for November 1984 was duly delivered
to and received by Antonio Litonjuaâs office on 12 December 1984.


Obviuosly, this
is factual issue but Court is constrained to resolve the same due ti the
incongruent findings of the SEC and the Court of Appeals. The maxim that the
factual fundings of the Court of Appeals are binding on the Supreme Court is
not absolute. There are various exceptions to the rule, one of which is when
factual findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary of those of the trial
court (or administrative body, as the case may be).
[11]


Private
respondent maintain that Antonio Litonjuaâs bill for November 1984 was duly
delivered to his office at 370 Blumentritt St., Mandaluyong by Mr. Victor Limbo
of Varied Services, Inc. (the messengerial service contracted by Wack Wack to
deliver various mail matter to its members) and was duly received by one of his
employees on 12 December 1984, as indicated on the Special Delivery Receipt
[12]
 
that private respondents presented
in evidence.


Antonio
Litonjua, on the hand, vehemently contends that he did not receive this
November 1984 statement of account from Wack Wack on 12 December 1984. He
disparages the testimony of the messenger, Mr. Victor Limbo, for his failure to
recall during the trial the face and the gender of the  person who received the statement of
account. What is more damaging, he adds, is that at beginning said witness
testified that he delivered that monthly bill to Antonio Litonjua himself. He,
likewise, asserts that he has no employee by the name of âAquino,â the
signature that was on the Special Delivery Receipt. Petitioners aver that the
factual finding  of the SEC Hearing
Delivery Receipt. Petitioner aver  that
the factual findings  of the SEC Hearing
Officer, affirmed by the SEC 
en banc
 , were based on substantial
evidence duly proven during the trial. They thus sum up their arguments by
quoting the fundamental rule that âconclusions and findings of fact by trial
court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless
for strong and cogent reasons because the trial court is in the better position
to examine real evidence, as well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses
while testifying in case.â
[13]


Petitionersâ
claims are unfounded.


The SEC, in the
26 March 1990 decision of its Hearing Officer, âgravely doubted,â and
consequently discredited Mr. Limboâs testimony due to his alleged inconsistent
statements. According to the SEC, Mr. Limbo testified that he delivered the
statement  of account directly to
Antonio Litonjua but later contradicted himself  by saying that he could no longer remember the gender of the
person who received the bill.
[14]


The SEC
committed an error in apprehending the facts.  We have judiciously studied Mr. Limbo's testimony on record and we
failed to find therein any statement that he delivered the November 1984
account to Antonio Litonjua himself.  Mr. Limbo was consistent in his testimony to the effect that on 12
December 1984 he delivered the November 1984 statement of account at the office
of Antonio Litonjua and it was received by an employee of the latter who signed
the Special Delivery Receipt.
[15]
 On
cross-examination, Mr. Limbo did not waver from his testimony that Antonio
Litonjuaâs November 1984 bill was duly received by the latterâs employee:


xxx.


ATTY.
DAMASO


Q
     
When you delivered this, did you ask for
the name of the person receiving it?


A
     
I cannot remember any more.


Q
     
You did not inquire whether he is an
employee of Mr. Litonjua or not?


A
     
I asked and he said he is employee.


Q
     
So, you asked him. This person is a man,
are you very sure of that?


A
     
I cannot remember any more.


Q
     
You
cannot remember if he is a man or a woman but you know that you asked him if he
is an employee?


A
     
Yes, Sir.
[16]


xxx.


As to Mr.
Limboâs failure to recall the face and gender of the person who received the
statement of account, we concur with the findings of the Court of Appeals:


xxx
The failure to recall whether the employee was male or female is not
significant, and may be naturally attributed to lapse of memory on the part of
the messenger. The delivery of the mail matter took place in December 1984 and
the witness testified in July 1989; besides the messenger must have delivered
mail matters for Wack-Wack to so many of its members, such that it would be
next to impossibility for him to remember distinctly the specific genders of
the individual persons receiving the mail matters from him. We thus hold that
the minor lapse in the testimony of the messenger, fourth grader , should not
detract from his credibility as a truthful witness.
[17]


Against the
testimony of Mr. Victor Limbo, coupled with documentary evidence in the  form  of the signed Special Delivery Receipt, petitioners presented no proof
other than the bare denial of Antonio Litonjua that he never received his
statement of account for November 1984 and that he has no âAquinoâ in his
employ. Petitioners could have readily offered in evidence a record or list of
Antonio Litonjuaâs employees to prove that he has no employee by the name
of  âAquinoâ but, strangely, beyond his
mere say-so no such evidence was adduced. In Trans-Pacific Industrial Supplies,
Inc. v. CA.
[18]
 we ruled
in this wise:


xxx As for the records, there is
actually none submitted by petitioner to prove that the contested amount, i.e.,
the interest, has been paid in full. In civil cases, the party that alleges a
fact has the burden of proving it (Imperial Victory Shipping Agency vs. NLRC,
200 SCRA 178 [1991]). Petitioner could have easily adduced the receipt
corresponding to the accounts paid inclusive of the interest to prove that it
has fully discharged its obligations but it did not.


Mr. Victor Limbo
has ben delivering various mail matter for Wack Wack to the members of the
latter in Mandaluyong (including Antonio Litonjua) in the regular performance
of his duties as messenger of Varied Services, Inc.
[19]
 Petitionersâ
bare denial, no matter how staunch, cannot thus prevail over the
straightforward testimony of Mr. Limbo as supported by the signed Special
Delivery Receipt.


It is clear from
the foregoing discussion that the factual findings of the SEC are not supported
by substantial evidence. Hence, it is the exception are well-stated in Datu
Tagoranao v. SEC.
[20]


Well-settled is the rule that the
finding of the facts of administrative  bodies will not be interfered with by the courts in the absence of grave
abuse of discretion on the part of said agencies, or 
unless the
aforementioned findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

(Gokongwei, Jr. vs. SEC, 97 SCRA 78.) In a long string of cases, the Supreme
Court  has  consistently adhered to the rule that decisions of administrative
officers are not to be disturbed by the courts except when the former have
acted without or in excess of their jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion (Sichangco vs. Board of Commissioner of Immigration, 94 SCRA 61).
Thus in the case of Deluao vs. Vasteel (L-21906, Dec. 24, 1968, 26 SCRA 475,
496, citing Pajo vs. Ago, et al., L-15414, June 30, 1960) and Genitano vs.
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, et al. (L-21167, March 31,
1966), the Supreme Court held that:


âxxx Finding of  fact by an administrative board of official,
following a hearing, are binding upon the courts and will not be disturbed
except where the board or official has gone beyond his statutory authority, exercised
unconstitutional power or clearly acted arbitrarily and without regard to his
duty or with grave abuse of discretion. xxx.â (Underscoring ours.)


Similarly, in Tabaco v. CA,
[21]
 we declared:


xxx
Almost as well-recognized as the general rule is the exception that the factual
findings of the trial court may nonetheless be reversed by the Court of Appeals
if by the evidence on record, or lack of it, it appears that the trial court
erred. xxx.


In the  case at bar, therefore, the Court of Appeals
was justified in setting aside the findings of the SEC.


We now proceed
to the main issue. Petitioners, in the support of their contention that they
were illegally suspended by Wack Wack, ratiocinated as follows:


1. 
      
Petitionersâ
60-day suspension is illegal and; therefore, void Section 34 of respondent
Clubs Bay-Laws states:


â. . .  (a) The treasurer shall bill the members monthly. As soon as
possible after the end of every month, a statement showing the account or bill
of a member for said amount will be prepared and sent to him,  
If the bill of any member remains unpaid
by the end of the month following that in which the bill was incurred
, his
name will be posted as deliquent the 
following day and while posted, he will
not be allowed to enjoy the privileges of the club. 
  A member cannot avail of  his deposit to pay his bill unless he
resigns.


...  ...  ...


(d)  
A member in the deliquent list who, in violation of the rule
in Section 34 (a) prohibiting deliquent members from enjoying the privileges of
the club,  proceeds to enjoy any club
privileges shall be deemed automatically suspend for a period of 60 days from
the date of the violation,
 and if during the automatic suspension period he
again proceeds to enjoy the club privileges, the Board shall immediately order
the expulsion of said member from the club. Payment of the deliquent account
during the suspension period shall not have the effect of lifting said
suspension.â


(Emphasis supplied; Exh. âK-15â)


Since the memberâs act of enjoying Club privileges
while his name is posted in the deliquent list merits 60-day suspension, it
follows that if his name is no longer in such list, the 60-day suspension
cannot be validly imposed. âAs correctly pointed out by the Hearing Officer,
(f)ailure of a member to pay his club dues does not automatically expose him to
sanction expressly provided for in the corporationâs by-laws. In other words,
it is a condition since quo non that he must first be posted as deliquent
before any sanction may be imposed upon himâ (SEC en bancâs Decision dated 13
August 1991 [Annex âDâ], p. 11)
[22]


Following this
framework -- that a member must first be posted in the  deliquent list before he may be suspended
for violating the prohibition against using club facilities while deliquent --
the SEC in its 13 August 1991 Order, found that on 13 January 1985 Antonio
Litonjuaâs name was indeed deleted from the posted list of deliquent members
for January 1985.
[23]
 Most
telling was the letter of Atty. Vicente F. Felix, General Manager of Wack Wack,
to the Board of Directors dated 15 March 1985, the pertinent portion of which
states that:


All the allegations contained in
the letter of Mr. Antonio K. Litonjua has been verified and including Oscar
Santos, Leddie Santos and Ador Rallos affirmed to the  truthfulness of such statement, when inquiries was made with the
Cashierâs Office, It was verified that Mr. Antonio K. Litonjuaâs name was
really deleted from the deliquent list of November as requested and therefore
the Club & employees could no way know that Mr. Litonjua was in  delinquency. He is requesting for
reconsideration of the Boardâs decision.
[24]


Hence, the Commission concluded, Sec. 34(d) of the clubâs by-laws which
metes out an automatic 60-day suspension on members on the delinquent list who
continue  to avail of club privileges,
does not apply to petitioner because when Antonio Litonjua used the club
facilities on 3 and 7 February 1985, he was no longer included in the posted
list of delinquent members. Consequently, the  automatic suspension imposed by Wack Wack on Antonio Litonjua (including
his son Arnold Litonjua), was illegal.
[25]


We disagree with
the SEC on the ground that its ruling focused solely on the factual deletion of
Antonio Litonjuaâs name from list of delinquent club members. The Commissionâs approach
was too rigid and blindly technical, That the auxiliary clerks in the Cashierâs
office of Wack Wack actually crossed out Antonio Litonjuaâs name from the
delinquent list is not dispute. However, the SEC should have considered and
delved deeper into the reasons and the circumstances behind the deletion.


As correctly
determined by the Court of Appeal, it was through misrepresentation that
Antonio Litonjua was able to have his name deleted from the list of delinquent
members. He insisted that he did not receive his statement of account for
November 1984 on 12 December 1984. As previously discussed, however, this claim
turned out to be unsubstantiated.


Another
indication of Anotnio Litonjuaâs duplicity is the sealed envelope he presented
at the Cashierâs office on the 13 January 1985, the same  day he found out he was on the January 1985
and, therefore, since the bill was delivered late he should not be included in
the posted list of deliquent members. With this explanation coupled with sealed
envelope Antonio Litonjua turned in, he managed to persuade the clerk to cross
out his name from the delinquent list. Later, however, when he sealed envelope
was opened, it was discovered that it contained not the statement of account
for November 1984 but  the bill for
December 1984. 


We view with
skepticism Antonio Litonjuaâs claim that he was unaware that the sealed
envelope  contained his December 1984
bill and he simply presumed it to contain his account for November 1984. It
must be recalled that at the accounting office of Wack Wack, he was informed
that his November 1984 bill was delivered to his office in Mandaluyong. If he
thought that the sealed envelope contained his November 1984 bill, he could
have simply opened said envelope at the presence of the auxiliary clerk to
prove, right there and then, the veracity of his claims. But, strangely, he did
not.


Hence, since it
was under false pretenses that Antonio Litonjua managed to have his name
deleted from the list of delinquent members the same has no force and effect.
Consequently, being a delinquent member in the posted list and having used club
facilities while posted as such, the imposition of suspension by respondent on
Antonio Litonjua (and his son Arnold Litonjua) pursuant to Sec. 34 (d) of the
club by-laws, was valid and legal.


In view  of the foregoing, it is immaterial to
discuss whether or not the auxiliary clerks have authority to delete Antonio
Litonjuaâs name from the list of delinquent members. As testified to Mr. Jessie
Casiguran, one of the auxiliary clerks of Wack Wack, it is their standard
operating procedure that when a member  pays his overdue account in full, they delete the memberâs name from the
delinquent list even without the prior authorization of the Membership
Committee and the Board of Directors which is the required procedure in
the  procedure in the clubâs by-laws.
[26]

Nonetheless, even if the auxiliary clerks have this authority, their deletion
of Antonio Litonjuaâs name in the case at bar was invalid for having been
accomplished through false representation.


On the
suspension of Arnold Litonjua, a Junior Member of Wack Wack, petitioner aver
that:


5.1 The only restriction on the
right and privileges of a Junior Member is that contained in Section 6 (g) of
the Revised By-Laws, which states that: â... when parents cease to be members,
the junior membership of their children is likewise terminated.â No similar
provision exists with regard to suspension. It cannot be claimed that the
provision applies to suspension of the parent-members because the reasonable
interpretation of any ambiguity should always be for the least restriction of
right. Clearly, petitioner Arnold Litonjua was unlawfully and arbitrarily
suspended.
[27]


On this
particular matter, the SEC 
en banc
 in its 13 August 1991 Order, ruled as
follows:


The third issue is whether or not
the suspension of an associate member automatically results in the suspension
of a junior member. 


This particular issue may be
resolved through an examination of the By-laws of Wack Wack Golf and Country
Club. Under the By-laws, a junior member is the son or daughter of a
proprietary member or an associate member in good standing whose age is between
10 to 22, single and elected as such by the Board. Moreover, junior membership
ceases upon the termination of membership of parents. It is clear that one of
the requisites for junior membership is that the parentâs membership is in good
standing. This requirement seems to be a condition imposed upon junior
membership such that when an associate or proprietary member suspended, the
junior membership attached thereto is likewise suspended because the parent
membership cannot be deemed in good standing. to subject the By-laws to another
interpretation would open the door to possible circumvention of the suspension
meted upon the proprietary or associate member.  If a junior member is allowed to avail of his club privileges
when either of his parents is suspended, then the latter may avail of club
privileges through the former thereby rendering the suspension nugatory.
Nevertheless, the fact that the suspension of Antonio Litonjua is hereby
declared illegal renders the suspension of Arnold Litonjua moot and academic.
[28]


We see no reason
to disturb the findings of the Commission. From the definition of a junior
member in Section 6(f) of the  clubâs
by-laws,
[29]
 it is
logical to conclude that the childrenâs membership, as junior members, is
dependent upon the membership of their parents. Hence, if the parent member is
suspended, the suspension includes their children who are junior members. This
âdependencyâ was admitted by Arnold Litonjua who testified as follows:


xxx.


Q
     
You said that you get separate billing once
a month?


A
     
Yes, sir.


Q
     
And in whose name is this billing issued?


A
     
Mr. Antonio K. Litonjua.


Q
          
In
the name of your father?


A
     
Yes.


Q
          
When
you say separate billings, you mean to say that your father has his own
billings.


A
           
Yes.


Q
          
Both
billings are in the name of your father?


A
           
Yes,
sir.


Q
          
And
it is father who has to pay these billings which pertains to you?


A
           
Yes,
sir.
