ROMERO, J.:


May the
confession of an accused, given before a police investigator upon invitation
and without the benefit of counsel, be admissible in evidence against him?


Accused-appellant
Herson Tan, along with Lito Amido, were charged with the crime of highway
robbery with murder before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 62, of Gumaca,
Quezon Province, under an information
[1]
 dated February 8, 1989, which reads
as follows:


âThat on or about the 5th day of
December 1988, along the Maharlika Highway at Barangay Tinandog, Municipality
of Atimonan, Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating
together and mutually helping each other, armed with bladed and pointed
weapons, with intent to gain, by means of force, violence, threats and
intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously take,
steal and carry away from one Freddie Saavedra, a Honda TMX motorcycle with a
sidecar bearing Plate No. DW 9961 valued at THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (
P
30,000.00)
Philippine currency, belonging to the said Freddie Saavedra, to the damage and
prejudice of the latter in the aforesaid amount; and that on the occasion of
said robbery and by reason thereof, the said accused,  with intent to kill, with evident premeditation and treachery,
and taking advantage of their superior strength and in pursuance of their conspiracy,
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and
stab with the said weapon said Freddie Saavedra, thereby inflicting upon the
latter multiple stab wounds on the different parts of his body, which directly
caused his death.


Contrary to law.â


On arraignment,
the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge.


The relevant
facts established by the prosecution are as follows:


On December 5, 1988, at about 7:00
oâclock p.m., tricycle driver Freddie Saavedra went to see his wife, Delfa, at
Our Lady of Angels Academy in Atimonan, Quezon, where the latter is a third
year high school student, to inform her that he will drive both accused to
Barangay Maligaya.  It was the last
time, however, that Freddie was seen alive.  When the latter failed to return that evening, Delfa, as early as 4:30
oâclock a.m. of December 6, 1988 inquired on his whereabouts from relatives and
friends.  In the course of such inquiry,
a certain Arnel Villarama revealed that the lifeless body of her husband was
discovered on the diversion road at Barangay Malinao in Atimonan.  Forthwith, they proceeded to the said place
and found him sprawled on the ground with fourteen stab wounds in different
parts of his body.


Meanwhile,
relying on the information that an abandoned sidecar of a tricycle was sighted
at Barangay Malinao, Lucena Philippine National Police (PNP) led by Lt. Carlos
Santos proceeded to the scene of the crime and recovered a blue sidecar which
they brought back with them to their headquarters.  Subsequently, Lt. Santos, Cpl. Numeriano Aguilar and Pat. Rolando
Alandy invited appellant in connection with the instant case and with respect
to two other robbery cases reported in Lucena City.  During their conversation, appellant allegedly gave an explicit
account of what actually transpired in the case at bar.  He narrated that he and co-accused Amido
were responsible for the loss of the motorcycle and the consequent death of
Saavedra.  Moreover, he averred that
they sold the motorcycle to a certain Danny Teves of Barrio Summit, Muntinlupa
for a sum of 
P
4,000.00.  With the
help of appellant as a guide, the Lucena PNP immediately dispatched a team to
retrieve the same.  


After admitting
that it was purchased from both the accused and upon failure to present any
document evidencing the purported sale, Teves voluntarily surrendered it to the
police who turned it over, together with the sidecar, to the Atimonan Police
Station for safekeeping.


Lt. Carlos, on
cross-examination, testified that when he invited appellant to their
headquarters, he had no warrant for his arrest.  In the course thereof, he informed the latter that he was a
suspect, not only in the instant case, but also in two other robbery cases
allegedly committed in Lucena City.  In
the belief that they were merely conversing inside the police station, he
admitted that he did not inform appellant of his constitutional rights to
remain silent and to the assistance of counsel; nor did he reduce the supposed
confession to writing.
[2]


Appellant, on
the other hand, alleged that he had no participation in the offense charged and
contended that his only involvement in the matter was the referral of accused
Amido to Teves.  He recounted that
sometime in December 1988, Amido sought him at his house and told him that the
motorcycle he was riding on was being offered for sale.  Upon proof shown that it was indeed
registered under Amidoâs name, he accompanied the latter to Manila on board the
said motorcycle and they approached Antonio Carandang.  The latter, thereafter, brought them to a
certain Perlita Aguilar and Danilo Teves with whom the sale was finally
consummated.  He allegedly received 
P
150.00
as his commission.


Amido presented
alibi as his defense.  He alleged that
although a tricycle driver by occupation, he was at Barangay Malusak, Atimonan
on the day in question, some seven kilometers from the town, busy assisting in
the renovation of his motherâs house.  He narrated that the victim was his friend and, therefore, he could not
have participated in the gruesome death of the latter.


In a decision
dated April 21, 1994, the trial court convicted appellant, the dispositive
portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, premised in the
foregoing considerations, this Court finds Herson Tan GUILTY beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime of Highway Robbery with Murder and hereby sentences him to
suffer an imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA.  He is further ordered to indemnify the family of the deceased in the
amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (
P
30,000.00).


Due to insufficiency of evidence, Lito
Amido is hereby ACQUITTED of the charges against him and the Provincial Warden
of Quezon, Provincial Jail, Lucena City, is hereby ordered to release from
custody the person of said Lito Amido, unless he is being detained thereat for
some other lawful cause.


SO ORDERED.â
[3]


Appellant
assails the finding of conviction despite failure of the prosecution to
positively identify him as the culprit of the crime and to present clear and
convincing circumstantial evidence that would overcome his innocence.


In light of the
above facts and circumstances, the appealed decision is set aside and appellant
acquitted on the ground that his constitutional rights were violated.


It is
well-settled that the Constitution abhors an uncounselled confession or
admission and whatever information is derived therefrom shall be regarded as
inadmissible in evidence against the confessant.  Article III, Section 12, paragraphs (1) and (3) of the
Constitution provides:


âx x x
                                           
x x x
                                     
x x x


Sec. 12. (1)  Any person under investigation for the
commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to
remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his
own choice.  If the person cannot afford
the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.  These rights cannot be waived except in
writing and in the presence of counsel.


x x x
                                             
x x
x
                                     
x x
x


(3)  Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this or the
preceding section shall be inadmissible against him.â


Republic Act No.
7438 (R.A. No. 7438),
[4]
 approved on May 15, 1992,
reenforced the constitutional mandate protecting the rights of persons under
custodial investigation, a pertinent provision
[5]
 of which reads:


âAs used in this Act, âcustodial
investigationâ shall include the practice of 
issuing an âinvitationâ to a
person who is investigated in connection with an offense he is suspected to
have committed
, without prejudice to the liability of the âinvitingâ
officer for any violation of law.â


Custodial
investigation involves any questioning initiated by law enforcement authorities
after a person is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of
action in any significant manner.  The
rules on custodial investigation begin to operate as soon as the investigation
ceases to be a general inquiry into an unsolved crime and begins to focus
a  particular suspect, the suspect is
taken into custody, and the police carries out a process of interrogations that
tends itself to eliciting incriminating statements that the rule begins to
operate.
[6]


Furthermore, not
only does the fundamental law impose, as a requisite function of the
investigating officer, the duty to explain those rights to the accused but also
that there must correspondingly be a meaningful communication to and
understanding thereof by the accused.  A
mere perfunctory reading by the constable of such rights to the accused would
thus not suffice.
[7]


Under the
Constitution and existing law and jurisprudence, a confession to be admissible
must satisfy the following requirements: (1) it must be voluntary; (2) it must
be made with the assistance of competent and independent counsel; (3) it must
be express; and (4) it must be in writing.
[8]


While the
Constitution sanctions the waiver of the right to counsel, it must, however, be
âvoluntary, knowing and intelligent, and must be made in the presence and with
the assistance of counsel.â
[9]
 To reiterate, in 
People v. Javar
,
[10]
 it was ruled therein that any
statement obtained in violation of the constitution, whether exculpatory or
inculpatory, in whole or in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence.  Even if the confession contains a grain of
truth, if it was made without the assistance of counsel, it becomes
inadmissible in evidence, regardless of the absence of coercion or even if it
had been voluntarily given.


The records of
this case do not indicate that appellant was assisted by counsel when he made
such waiver, a finding evident from the testimony of Lt. Santos on
cross-examination, thus:


âQ
    
Now,
when you brought Herson Tan to the Headquarters, did you tell him that he is
one of the suspects in the robbery slain (sic) that took place in Atimonan on
December 5, 1988?


A
     
Yes,
sir, and he was also suspect to the robbery case which was investigated at
Lucena Police Station.  There were two
(2) cases which were investigated on Herson Tan.


Q
     
Now,
so in addition to the Atimonan case, you also took Herson Tan to your custody
in connection with another case that happened in Lucena?


A
     
Yes,
sir.


Q
     
And
you happened to have Herson Tan in your list as suspect in both cases because
Herson was previously incarcerated at Lucena City Jail in connection with a
certain case, is it not?


A
     
Yes,
sir.


Q
     
Just
for curiosity sake, you invited him in your headquarters, is that what happened
in this case?


A
     
Yes,
sir.


Q
     
And
it just happened that without applying third degree to him he gave you that
information?


A
     
Yes,
sir.


Q
     
Did
you notify him of his constitutional right to counsel before you propounded
questions to him
?


A
     
No,
sir, because we are asking question only to him.


Q
     
Before
propounding question or information you sought to elicit from him, 
did you
inform him of his constitutional right not to testify against himself because
he is a suspect in these two (2) cases
?


A
     
No, sir, because we were just conversing.
[11]
 
(Underscoring supplied)


The evidence for
the prosecution shows that when appellant was invited for questioning at the
police headquarters, he allegedly admitted his participation in the crime.  This will not suffice to convict him,
however, of said crime. The constitutional rights of appellant, particularly
the right to remain silent and to counsel, are impregnable from the moment he
is investigated in connection with an offense he is suspected to have
committed, even if the same be initiated by mere invitation.  âThis Court values liberty  and will always insist on the observance of
basic constitutional rights as a condition 
sine qua non
 against the
awesome investigative and prosecutory powers of government.â
[12]


What remains of
the evidence for the prosecution is inadequate to warrant a conviction.  Considering the circumstances attendant in
the conduct of appellantâs investigation which fell short of compliance with
constitutional safeguards, we are constrained to acquit the appellant.


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the decision
of the Regional Trial Court of Gumaca, Quezon (Branch 62) is REVERSED and SET
ASIDE.  Appellant HERSON TAN y VERZO is
hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged and his immediate release from
confinement is hereby ordered, unless there is any other lawful cause for
continued detention.  Costs
