ROMERO, J.:


It has been held
in numerous decisions
[1]
 that failure to file an appeal
within the reglementary period deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to
alter the final judgment, much less to entertain the appeal.  This timeworn issue is again before us.


In 1974
petitioner Mariano Enriquez operated Shoe Shop which is engaged in the
manufacture and export of shoes to the United States of America as sole
proprietor.  In 1978, he formed Chibum
Shoe Corporation (Chibum) with the following stockholders: Mariano Enriquez -
940 shares; Felipe Santos - 40 shares; Conrado Nepomuceno - 40 shares; and
Marina Eugenio - 40 shares.  When Chibum
was dissolved allegedly for the losses it incurred, Rodolfo Enriquez, the son
of Mariano, organized Cristina Shoes, Inc.


In December
1988, Mariano Shoe Corporation was organized with the following stockholders,
to wit: Mariano Enriquez - 1000 shares; Rosalita Enriquez - 1000 shares; Vilma
Enriquez - 500 shares; Rodolfo Enriquez - 500 shares; Editha Enriquez Valerio -
500 shares; and Ma. Cristina Enriquez - 500 shares.  Subsequently, in May 1990, Merâs Shoe Manufacturing, Inc. (MSMI)
was formed involving the same stockholders of Mariano Shoe Corporation.


Respondents, on
the other hand, were hired by MSMI as piece rate workers.  On February 22, 1993, they were allegedly
barred from entering the company compound on the ground of petitionerâs serious
business decline.  They asserted that
MSMI illegally ceased its operations when it failed to issue the requisite
notices to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and to the employees
concerned.  MSMI, on the other hand,
contended that it acted in good faith arguing that there exists a valid cause
for its shutdown.


On complaint
assailing the legality of the stoppage of MSMIâs operations and for the
recovery of, among other things, separation pay, on January 24, 1994, Labor
Arbiter Melquiades Sol D. Del Rosario rendered a decision, the dispositive
portion of which reads as follows:


âCONFORMABLY WITH THE FOREGOING,
judgment is hereby rendered finding the shutdown to be with cause but without
the required notice and so indemnity pay in the sum of 
P
1,000.00 should
be paid to each complainant.


Further all the respondents are
ordered to pay complainants in solidum the following claims, but subject to
their individual liability among themselves for the period they were actually
the employees of complainants.  These
claims are:


a)
             
13th
month pay for 1990; and proportionate 13th month pay for 1993;


b)
             
Separation
pay at 
15 days
 for every year of service, or at least one (1) month pay
which ever is higher; as appearing herein.

Attorneyâs
Fees equivalent to 5% of the awarded money claims.

SO
ORDERED.â
[2]


Having received
the above decision on February 4, 1994, petitioner perfected its appeal before
respondent NLRC on February 14, 1994.  Simultaneous with the filing thereof, petitioner filed a motion to
reduce the amount of the bond which the NLRC partially granted in an order
dated May 31, 1995, the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
respondent-movants should be, as it is hereby ordered to post a cash or surety
bond issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the Commission or
the Supreme Court in the amount of 
P
403,126.20 within ten (10) calendar
days from receipt hereof.


Should respondents-movants opt to
post a surety bond, they shall, in addition, submit with their counsel a joint
declaration under oath attesting that the surety bond to be posted is genuine
and that it shall be in effect until final disposition of the case.


SO ORDERED.â
[3]


On July 28,
1995, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration from the above order which
the NLRC treated as a motion for extension of time to perfect an appeal which
is a prohibited pleading under the New Rules of Procedure.  Consequently, ruling that the ten-day
reglementary period within which to post the appeal bond having lapsed, NLRC
dismissed the instant appeal.  Hence,
this petition.


We find for the
respondents.


Article 223 of
the Labor Code requires, 
inter alia
 that in case of a judgment involving
a monetary award, an appeal by the employer may be perfected only upon posting
of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited
by the commission in the amount equivalent to the monetary award in the
judgment appealed from.  Perfection of
an appeal within the period and in the manner prescribed by law is
jurisdictional and non-compliance with such legal requirements is fatal and has
the effect of rendering the judgment final and executory.
[4]
 This requirement is intended to
discourage employers from using the appeal to delay, or even evade, their
obligation to satisfy their employeeâs just and lawful claims.  Such a requirement is jurisdictional and
cannot be trifled with.
[5]


The intention of
the lawmakers to make the bond an indispensable requisite for the perfection of
an appeal by the employer is underscored by the provision that an appeal by the
employer may be perfected only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond.  The word âonlyâ makes it perfectly clear,
that the lawmakers intended the posting of a cash or surety bond by the
employer to be the exclusive means by which an employerâs appeal may be
perfected.
[6]
 It must be noted, however, âthat
the law does not require its outright payment, but only the posting of a bond
to ensure that the award will be eventually paid should the appeal fail.â
[7]


While Section
6(c), Rule VI
[8]
 of the New Rules of Procedure of
the NLRC allows the reduction of the appeal bond upon motion of appellant and
on meritorious grounds, the same must be filed within the reglementary period
for appealing.  The records reveal that
when petitioner sought the reduction of the bond to 
P
200,000.00,  the NLRC partially granted the same by
allowing a 50% reduction of the required bond or in the amount of 
P
403,126.20.  


In support of
petitionerâs contention, it begs the  Court to re-examine the following cases, to wit: YBL v. NLRC;
[9]
 Erectors, Incorporated v. NLRC;
[10]
 and Rada v. NLRC, 
[11]
 in relation to the case at bar.


After a careful
scrutiny of the above cases and finding that the factual circumstances differ
from each other, we are unconvinced of its application to the instant
petition.  A distinction, therefore, of
said cases is in order.


In the Erectors
case, the labor arbiter rendered a decision which reinstated the respondent
therein to his former position with full backwages, without loss of seniority
rights or benefits accruing after his dismissal, and to pay him 
P
300,000.00
as moral damages, 
P
100,000.00 as exemplary damages and 10% of all said
sums, as attorneyâs fees.  While YBL did
not question the reinstatement aspect of the decision, it, however, sought to
dismiss the award of moral and exemplary damages.  For allegedly failing to post the bond within the reglementary
period, NLRC dismissed the appeal.  On
petition before this Court, we ruled that:


âThe equivalence thus expressly
prescribed between the amount of the appeal bond and the monetary award, less
moral and exemplary damages, made in the decision sought to be appealed not
only underscores the fact that the obvious and logical purpose of an appeal
bond is to insure, during the period of appeal, against any occurrence that
would defeat or diminish recovery under the judgment if subsequently affirmed;
it also validates and justifies, at least 
prima facie
, an interpretation
that would limit the amount of the bond to the aggregate of the sums awarded
other than in the concept of moral and exemplary damages.â


In fine, the
labor arbiter gravely erred in including moral and exemplary damages in the
computation of the appeal bond when the law clearly provides that moral and
exemplary damages shall not be included in fixing the amount of the bond.
[12]


In the YBL case,
the NLRC similarly dismissed the appealed decision of the labor arbiter for the
non-posting of the appeal bond within the reglementary period.  We ruled, thus:


â
Moreover, in the appealed
decision of the labor arbiter the exact total amount due to the private
respondents as separation pay is not stated which would be the basis of the
bond that is required to be filed by petitioners under the said law
.  Thus even if petitioners may be expected to
know the law, then they allege that they would have to go to the socio-analyst
of the NLRC to compute the approximate amount due the private respondents as
the basis of the amount of the bond to be filed so that it is not probable that
they may be able to secure such computation within the non-extendible period of
ten (10) days to appeal provided for by law.â (Underscoring supplied)


In view of the
foregoing circumstance, petitioner therein could not have posted a bond, the
same having been omitted by the labor arbiter.


In Rada, the
labor arbiter likewise committed the same infraction as in the YBL case.  Thus:


âSaid decision did not state the amount
awarded as backwages and overtime pay, hence the amount of the supersedeas bond
could not be determined.  It was only in
the order of the NLRC of February 16, 1990 that the amount of the supersedeas
bond was specified and which bond, after an extension granted by the NLRC, was
timely filed by private respondent.â


The instant
petition, however, presents a different factual milieu.  As pertinently observed by the Solicitor
General in his Comment:


âTo have
the bond reduced is not a matter of right on the part of the movant but lies
within the sound discretion of the NLRC upon showing of meritorious
grounds.  After the NLRC had exercised
its discretion in fixing the bond, the petitioner should have complied with it.  To file a subsequent motion this time seeking
another reconsideration of the already reduced value of the bond, is indeed to
request for an extension of time to perfect the appeal which is prohibited
under the NLRC Rules of Procedure.  To
rule otherwise will encourage endless motions for reconsideration seeking
reduction of the required bond thereby rendering futile the requirement of the
law to make bond an indispensable requisite for the perfection of appeal by the
employer.â
[13]


We, therefore,
rule that for petitionerâs failure to post the required bond within the
reglementary period after it has been ordered reduced, the NLRC committed no
grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitionerâs appeal.


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is
DISMISSED.  The decision of the National
Labor Relations Commission dated January 24, 1994, is accordingly AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
