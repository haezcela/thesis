PANGANIBAN, J.:


The Court
reiterates some fundamental labor doctrines:  (1) this Court may review factual determinations where the findings of
the med-arbiter conflict with those of the undersecretary of labor; (2) an
employer-employee  relationship  may be established by substantial
evidence;  (3) procedural due process is
satisfied by the grant of an opportunity to be heard and an actual
adversarial-type trial is not required; (4) the NLRC commits grave abuse of
discretion when it remands a case to the labor arbiter in spite of ample pieces
of evidence on record which are sufficient to decide the case directly; and (5)
where illegal dismissal is proven, the workers  are entitled to back wages and other similar benefits without deductions
or conditions.


Statement of the Case


These doctrines
are used by the Court in resolving these consolidated petitions for certiorari
under Rule 65, challenging the resolutions of Undersecretary Bienvenido
Laguesma and the National Labor Relations Commission.


First Case


In G.R. No.
113542, hereafter referred to as the First Case, Petitioner Caurdanetaan Piece
Workers Union/Association (CPWU) prays for the nullification and reversal of
Undersecretary Laguesmaâs Order dated January 4, 1994 in OS-MA-A-8-119-93
(RO100-9207-RU-001), which granted Respondent Corfarmâs motion for
reconsideration and dismissed petitionerâs prayer for certification election.  The dispositive portion of the assailed
Order reads as follows:
[1]


âWHEREFORE, the questioned
Order is hereby set aside and a new one issued dismissing the petition for
certification election for lack of merit.â


In his earlier
Order dated September 7, 1993, Laguesma affirmed Med-Arbiter Sinamar E. Limosâ
order of March 18, 1993 which disposed as follows:
[2]


âIN VIEW OF ALL THE
FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the above-entitled petition is hereby granted.  Consequently, the motion to dismiss filed by
Corfarm Grains, Inc. is denied.


Let a certification
election be conducted among the rank-and-file employees of Corfarm Grains,
Inc., within ten (10) days from receipt hereof, with the following choices:


1.
             
Caurdanetaan
Piece Workers Union;


2.
             
No
Union


A pre-election conference is
hereby set on March 29, 1993 at 2:00 oâ clock in the afternoon at the DOLE,
Dagupan District Office, Mayombo District, Dagupan City to thresh out the
mechanics of the Certification Election.  Employer Corfarm Grains, Inc. is hereby directed to present its
employment records for the period covering January to June 1992 evidencing
payment of salaries of its employees.


Let the parties be notified
accordingly.â


Aggrieved by
Respondent Laguesmaâs subsequent Order dated January 27, 1994
[3]
 denying its motion for
reconsideration, petitioner filed this recourse before this Court.


Second Case


In G.R. No.
114911, hereafter referred to as the Second Case, petitioner assails the
Resolution promulgated on February 16, 1994 in NLRC CA No. L-001109
[4]
 by the National Labor Relations
Commission (Respondent NLRC),
[5]
 the dispositive portion of which
reads:
[6]


âWHEREFORE, the Decision of
the Labor Arbiter dated 14 September 1993 is hereby SET ASIDE.  Let the records of the case be REMANDED to
the Arbitration Branch of origin for immediate appropriate proceedings.â


The labor
arbiterâs decision that was reversed by Respondent NLRC disposed as follows:
[7]


âWHEREFORE, judgment is
hereby rendered as follows:


1.
             
Declaring individual complainantsâ
dismissal illegal;


2.
             
Declaring respondent guilty of
unfair labor practice;


3.
             
Ordering
respondent to pay the 92
[8]
 
complainants the following:


a)
     
13th month pay limited to three years in
the amount of P4,788.00 each;


b)
     
service incentive leave pay in the amount
of P855.00 each for three years;


c)
     
underpaid wages covering the period June
1989 to June 1992 which amount to P47,040.00 each;


d)
     
backwages reckoned from June 1992, the date
of dismissal[,] to September 1993, the date of promulgation of the decision or
a period of 14 months, in the amount of P22,344.00 each;


e)
     
refund of P12.00/day deduction limited to
three years which amounts to P12,096 each; and 


f)
      
to pay the complainants 
P
1,000.00
each as damages.


4.
             
To
reinstate the complainants to their former position[s] immediately.


All
other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.â


In a Resolution
promulgated on March 28, 1994, Respondent NLRC denied petitionerâs motion for
reconsideration.
[9]


The Facts


In his
Consolidated Memorandum, the solicitor general recited the following pertinent
facts, which we find amply supported by the records:
[10]


âPetitioner union has
ninety-two (92) members who worked as âcargadorâ at the warehouse and ricemills
of private respondent [referring to Respondent Corfarm] at Umingan, Pangasinan
since 1982.  As cargadores, they loaded,
unloaded and piled sacks of palay from the warehouse to the cargo trucks and
those brought by cargo trucks for delivery to different places.  They were paid by private respondent on a
piece rate basis.  When private
respondent denied some benefits to these cargadores, the latter organized
petitioner union.  Upon learning of its
formation, private respondent barred its members from working with them and
replaced [them] with non-members of the union sometime in the middle of 1992.


On July 9, 1992, petitioner
filed [a petition] for certification election before the Regional Office No. I
of the Department of Labor and Employment, San Fernando, La Union docketed as
RO100-9207-RU-001.


While this petition for
certification election was pending, petitioner also filed on November 16, 1992,
a complaint for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, refund of illegal
deductions, payment of wage differentials, various pecuniary benefits provided
by laws, damages, legal interest, reinstatement and attorneyâs fees, against
private respondent before the Regional Arbitration Branch No. 1 of Dagupan
City, docketed as NLRC RAB Case No. 01-117-0184-92.


On November 24, 1992, Labor
Arbiter Ricardo Olairez in NLRC Case No. Sub-Rab 01-117-0184-92, directed the
parties to submit position paper on or before December 14, 1992, and to appear
for hearing on the said date.  Only the
complainant petitioner submitted its position paper on December 3, 1992.


Likewise in the scheduled
hearing on December 14, 1992, private respondent did not appear[;] thus Labor
Arbiter Olairez allowed the president of petitioner union Juanito Costales to
testify and present its evidence ex-parte.


On December 16 1992,
another notice was sent to the parties to appear on [the] January 7, 1993
hearing by Labor Arbiter Emiliano de Asis.


Before the scheduled
hearing on January 7, 1993, complainant petitioner filed a motion to amend
complaint and to admit amended complaint.  It also filed the following:


1.
       
Affidavit of Juanito Costales, Jr., dated
November 24, 1992;


2.
       
Joint affidavit of Ricardo Aban, Armando
Casing, Benjamin Corpuz, Danny Margadejas, Fidel Fortunato, Henry de los Reyes,
Anthony de Luna, Warlito Arguilles, Dominador Aguda, Marcelino Cayuda, Jr.,
Jaime Costales and Juanito Mendenilla dated December 30, 1992;


3.
       
Joint affidavit of Juanito Costales and
Armando Casing dated January 7, 1993;


4.
       
Affidavit signed by individual union
members.


On March 18, 1993,
Med-Arbiter Sinamar E. Limos issued an Order granting the petition for certification
election earlier filed.


Meanwhile, Labor Arbiter
Rolando D. Gambito in the illegal dismissal case issued the May 20, 1993 Order,
the dispositive portion [of] which reads:


âWHEREFORE,
respondents are hereby ordered to submit their position paper, together with
their documentary evidence, if any, within TEN (10) days from receipt of the
order, otherwise we will be constrained to resolve this case based on available
evidence on record.â


On September 7, 1993,
public respondent Laguesma issued a Resolution denying the appeal filed by
private respondent against the order of Med-Arbiter Limos granting the petition
for certification election.


Acting on said denial,
private respondent filed a motion for reconsideration which was granted in an
Order dated January 4, 1994 by public respondent Laguesma dismissing the
petition for certification election for lack of employer-employee relationship.


Petitioner in turn filed a
motion for reconsideration of the January 4, 1994, Order but it was denied by
public respondent Laguesma in his January 27, 1994 Order which reaffirmed the
dismissal of petition for certification election.


Thus, the union filed its
first petition for certiorari assailing the Orders of January 4 and 27, 1994 of
public respondent Laguesma dismissing the petition for certification
election.  The said petition is
captioned as âCaurdanetaan Piece Workers Union, petitioner, vs. Hon. Bienvenido
Laguesma, et al., respondents,â docketed as G.R. No. 113542 and raffled to the
Second Division of this Honorable Court.â


On September 14,
1993, Labor Arbiter Rolando D. Gambito issued his decision finding the
dismissal of petitionerâs members illegal.  On appeal by both parties, Respondent NLRC -- as earlier stated -- set
aside the appealed decision and remanded the case to the labor arbiter for
further proceedings.  Petitionerâs
motion for reconsideration was later denied.


The solicitor
general, who was supposed to represent both public respondents, joined
petitioner and filed a âManifestation and Motion (In Lieu of Comment)â dated
July 25, 1994, praying that the petition in the First Case âbe granted and that
judgment be rendered annullingâ
[11]
 the assailed Orders of Respondent
Laguesma.  The Republicâs counsel
likewise filed another âManifestation and Motion (In Lieu of Comment)â dated
October 4, 1994 in the Second Case, praying that âjudgment be rendered
annulling the resolution of Public Respondent NLRC dated February 16, 1994 and
March 28, 1994 and order[ing] public respondent to proceed with the case
instead of remanding the same to the labor arbiter of origin.â
[12]


In a Resolution
dated March 29, 1995,
[13]
 this Court ordered the
consolidation of the two cases.
[14]


Public Respondentsâ Rulings


In the First Case


Public Respondent
Laguesma premised the dismissal of the petition for certification election on
the absence of an employer-employee relationship between petitionerâs members
and private respondent. Professing reliance on the control test in determining
employer-employee relationship, his Order dated January 4, 1994
[15]
 explained:


âIt is settled in this
jurisdiction that the most important factor in determining the existence of
employer-employee relationship is the control test or the question of whether or
not the supposed employer exercises control over the means and methods by which
the work is to be done.  In the instant
case, it is not disputed that movant does not exercise any degree of control
over how the loading or unloading of cavans of palays to or from the trucks, to
or from the rice mills.  Movantâs only
concern is that said cavans of palay are loaded/unloaded.  Absent therefore, the power to control not
only the end to be achieved but also the means to be used in reaching such end,
no employer-employee relationship could be said to have been established.  We also noted that some of petitionerâs
members including its president, Juanito Costales, Jr., admitted in separate
sworn statements that they offer and actually perform loading and unloading
work for various rice mills in Pangasinan and that the performance of said work
depends on the availability of work in said mills.  They also categorically stated that there is no employer-employee
relationship between petitioner and movant.  To our mind, said declarations being made against interest deserve much
evidentiary weight.  Considering
therefore, the foregoing, we have no alternative but to dismiss the petition
for lack of employer-employee relationship.â


In the Second
Case


On the other
hand, Respondent NLRC ordered the remand of the case to the arbitration branch
for further proceedings because âthe issues at hand need further threshing
out.â  Stressing the principle that
allegations must be proved by âcompetent and credible evidence,â it held:
[16]


âThere is no question that
under the Rules of the Commission, complaints may be resolved on the basis of
the Position Papers submitted by the parties and that the parties may be deemed
to have waived their right to present evidence after they have been given an
opportunity to do so.  These procedural
rules, however should be read in conjunction with the time[-]honored principle
that allegations must be proved and established by competent and credible
evidence.  In other words, mere
allegations would not suffice despite the absence of evidence to the contrary.


In subject case,
complainants-appellantsâ allegations that they are laborers of
respondents-appellants receiving 
P
45.00 per dayâs work of eight hours
(p. 2, Amended Position Paper dated December 14, 1992, p. 31 Records; p. 2
Amended Complaint dated 16 December 1992, p. 70, Records) appears to be in
conflict with their earlier assertions that they are paid on the basis of the
number of cavans of palay moved, piled, hauled and unloaded from trucks or haulers
multiplied by 
P
0.12 [per] sack or cavan.â  And for the dayâs earning ârespondents used to be obliged to pay 
P
57.00
per dayâs earning -- â (p. 2, Position Paper dated 24 November 1992; p. 17,
Records).


Similarly attached to the
records is a narrative report of [the] DOLE inspector where it was mentioned
that Juanito Costales, Jr., is the owner of Carcado Contracting Services and is
not an employee of Corefarm [sic] Grains (Narrative Report dated August 4,
1992, p. 10 Records).


Another reason why subject
case should be remanded to the Labor Arbiter below is the fact that the
personality of complainant union has been raised in issue before the proper
forum and adverse decision on the matter will definitely affect the whole
proceedings.


Furthermore, records show
that an Amended Complaint was filed on December 23, 1992.  This amended complaint made no mention of
the affidavits of Juanito Costales, Jr. and the 92 other workers which
documents were filed in January 1993.  Likewise, the amended complaint contains but a general statement that
the 92 workers of Corefarm [sic] Grains have been employed since 1982 which was
adopted by the Labor Arbiter below in his decision notwithstanding the fact
that a number of these workers started working with respondent after 1982.  Some of whom worked with the company in 1990
(Joint Affidavit dated 7 January 1993, pp. 96-98, Records).  Notwithstanding this fact, the Labor Arbiter
in the decision under consideration allowed refund of alleged deduction for a
period of three years.  In the same
manner, payment of salary differential was also granted.


Indeed the issues at hand
need further threshing out.  Under the
Rules, the Labor Arbiter is authorized to thresh out issues (sec. 4, Rule
V).  As it is, we are not convinced by
the conclusions of the Labor Arbiter.


The ends of justice would
better be served if all parties are granted further opportunity to ventilate
their respective positions.â


The Issues


In its
Consolidated Memorandum dated September 19, 1995 filed before us, petitioner
raises the following âgroundsâ in support of its petition:
[17]


â1.
      
Grave abuse of discretion or acting in
excess of jurisdiction, which is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction on the part
of public respondent in setting aside the labor arbiterâs decision and in
remanding this case to the office of origin for further proceedings is not
necessary when in fact the mandatory requirements of due process have been
observed by the labor arbiter in rendering decision on the case; 


2.
       
Remand of the case to office of origin
for further proceedings on matters already passed upon properly by the labor
arbiter is contrary to the rule of speedy labor justice and the [sic] social
justice and to afford protection to labor policy of the Philippine
Constitution, which is a command that should not be disregarded by the courts
in resolving labor cases;


3.
       
Remand of the case to the labor arbiter
would only prolong social unrest and the suffering of injurious effects of
illegal dismissal by the 92 illegally dismissed workers[;] hence, said remand
of the case without justification constitutes an oppressive act committed by
public respondent.â


Simply put, the
issues are as follows:


1.
  
Whether Respondent Laguesma acted with grave
abuse of discretion in ordering the dismissal of the petition for certification
election


2
   
Whether Respondent NLRC acted with grave
abuse of discretion in remanding the illegal dismissal case to the labor
arbiter for further proceedings.


The present
controversy hinges on whether an employer-employee relationship between the
CPWU members and Respondent Corfarm has been established by substantial
evidence.


The Courtâs Ruling


The two
petitions are meritorious.


Main Issue:  
Employer-Employee Relationship


First Case:  
Certification Election


Petitioner contends
that Respondent Laguesma committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the
petition for certification election by relying on private respondentâs bare
allegation, in its motion for reconsideration, of lack of employer-employee
relationship.
[18]
 According to petitioner, Respondent
Laguesma cannot reverse his Decision in the absence of a concomitant change in
his factual findings.
[19]
 Petitioner insists that all its
members were employees of private respondent, 
viz.
:
[20]


âThe 92 workers, who are
all union members of petitioner herein, have been rendering actual manual
services as âcargadoresâ in the warehouse and rice mills of private respondent,
performing activities usually related to or desirable by [sic] the business or
trade of private respondent who is engaged in the buy and sell of palay as well
as warehousing of said commodity and milling the same for sale to customers in
the form of milled rice.  The 92 workers
have performed their activities for the last ten (10) years prior to their
having been illegally dismissed from employment on June 18, 1992 or
thereabouts.â


Petitioner adds
that many of its members received Christmas bonuses from private respondent.
[21]


On the other
hand, Respondent Corfarm describes the contentions of petitioner as 


âoff-tangent,
if not irrelevant. --


First
, 
the authority of the DOLE Secretary to decide
appeals in representation cases is undeniable
 (see e.g., Sections 9 and 10
of Rule V, Book V, of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code;
also Art. 259, appeal from certification election orders, labor code).  
Second
, petitioner completely misses
the point that the 
granting and denial of a motion for reconsideration
involves the exercise of discretion
.  As submitted by the Public Respondent in its Comment, âamong the ends to
which a Motion for Reconsideration is addressed, one is precisely to convince
the court that its ruling is erroneous and improper, contrary to law or the
evidenceâ, x x xâ (Emphasis found in the original.)


Corfarm insists
that the challenged Order of Respondent Laguesma dated January 4, 1994 rests on
âsolid findings of factâ which should be accorded respect and finality.
[22]
 It attacks the petitionerâs
allegation -- that it has â92â workers who worked as âcargadorâ at its
warehouses -- as âgratuitous and not supported by any evidence x x x [because]
as late as this time of day in the litigation of this case, 
who exactly are
those 92 workers cannot be known from the records
.â
[23]
 (Emphasis in original.)


Private
respondent further argues that 
RJL Martinez Fishing Corp. vs. NLRC,
[24]
 
cited by the solicitor general, has a factual
situation different from the case at bar.  âWaiting time,â unlike that in 
RJL Martinez Fishing Corp., 
does
not obtain here.
[25]
 Likewise allegedly inapplicable are
the rulings in 
Villavilla vs. Court of Appeals
[26]
 
and in 
Brotherhood Labor Unity Movement vs.
Zamora.
[27]


Respondent
Corfarm denies that it had the power of control, rationalizing that
petitionerâs members âwere âstreet-hiredâ workers engaged from time to time to
do loading and unloading work x x x[;] [t]here [was] no
superintendent-in-charge x x x to give orders x x x[;] [and] there [were] no
gate passes issued, nor tools, equipment and paraphernalia issued by Corfarm
for loading/unloading x x x.â
[28]
 It attributes error to the
solicitor generalâs reliance on Article 280
[29]
 of the Labor Code.  Citing 
Brent School, Inc. vs. Zamora
,
[30]
 private respondent asserts that a
literal application of such article will result in âabsurdity,â where
petitionerâs members will be regular employees not only of respondents but also
of several other rice mills, where they were allegedly also under service.  Finally, Corfarm submits that the OSGâs
position is negated by the fact that âpetitionerâs members contracted for
loading and unloading services with respondent company when such work was
available 
and
 when they felt like it x x x.â
[31]


We rule for
petitioners.  Section 5, Rule 133 of the
Rules of Court mandates that in cases filed before administrative or
quasi-judicial bodies,  like the
Department of Labor, a fact may be established by substantial evidence, 
i.e.

âthat amount of evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
justify a conclusion.â
[32]
 Also fundamental is the rule
granting not only respect but even finality to factual findings of the
Department of Labor, if supported by substantial evidence.  Such findings are binding upon this Court,
unless petitioner is able to show that the secretary of labor (or the
undersecretary acting in his place) has arbitrarily disregarded or misapprehended
evidence before him to such an extent as to compel a contrary conclusion if
such evidence were properly appreciated.  This is rooted in the principle that this Court is not a trier of facts,
and that the determinations made by administrative bodies on matters falling
within their respective fields of specialization or expertise are accorded
respect.
[33]
 Also well-settled is the doctrine
that the existence of an employer-employee relationship is ultimately a
question of fact and that the findings thereon by the labor authorities shall
be accorded not only respect but even finality when supported by substantial
evidence.
[34]
 Finally, in 
certiorari 
proceedings
under Rule 65, this Court does not, as a rule, evaluate the sufficiency of
evidence upon which the labor officials based their determinations.  The inquiry is essentially limited to
whether they acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion.
[35]
 However, this doctrine is not
absolute.  Where the labor officerâs
findings are contrary to those of the med-arbiter, the Court -- in the exercise
of its equity jurisdiction -- may wade into and reevaluate such findings,
[36]
 which we now embark on in this
case.
[37]


To determine the
existence of an employer-employee relation, this Court has consistently applied
the âfour-foldâ test which has the following elements: (1) the power to hire,
(2) the payment of wages, (3) the power to dismiss, and (4) the power to
control -- the last being the most important element.
[38]


Our examination
of the case records indubitably shows the presence of an employer-employee
relationship.  Relying on the evidence
adduced by the petitioners, Respondent Laguesma himself affirmed the presence
of such connection.  Thus, in his Order
dated September 7, 1993, he astutely held:
[39]


âAnent the first issue, we
find the annexes submitted by the respondent company not enough to prove that
herein petitioner is indeed an independent contractor.  The existence of an independent contractor
relationship is generally established by the following criteria.  The contractor is carrying on an independent
business; [the] nature and extent of the work; the skill required; the term and
duration of the relationship; the right to assign the performance of a
specified piece of work; the control and supervision over the workers; payment
of the contractorâs workers; the control and the supervision over the workers;
the control of the premises; the duty to supply the premises, tools,
appliances, materials and laborers, and the mode, manner and terms of
payment.  [Brotherhood Labor Unity
Movement of the Philippines vs. Zamora, 147 SCRA 49 (198) [sic] ].


None of the above criteria
exists in the case at bar.  The absence
of a written contract which specifies the performance of a specified piece of
work, the nature and extent of the work and the term and duration of the
relationship between herein petitioner and respondent company belies the
latters [sic] allegation that the former is indeed and [sic] independent
contractor.


Also, respondent failed to
show by clear and convincing proof that herein respondent has the substantial
capital or investment to qualify as an independent contractor under the
law.  The premises, tools, equipments
[sic] and paraphernalia are all supplied by respondent company.  It is only the manpower or labor force which
the alleged contractor supplies, suggesting the existence of a âlabor onlyâ
contracting scheme which is prohibited by law.  Further, if herein petitioner is indeed an independent contractor, it
should have offered its services to other companies and not to work [sic]
exclusively for the respondent company.  It is therefore, clear that the alleged J.P. Costales, Jr. Cargador
Services cannot be considered as an independent contractor as defined by law.â


In his
subsequent order, Respondent Laguesma inexplicably reversed his above ruling
and held that there was no employer-employee relationship on the ground that
Respondent Corfarm exercised no power of control over the alleged employees.


It may be asked,
why the sudden change of mind on the part of Respondent Laguesma?  No additional pieces of evidence were
adduced and no existing ones were identified by Laguesma to support such
strange reversal.  The unblemished fact
is that private respondent was the recruiter and employer of petitionerâs
members.


Shoppers Gain
Supermart vs. NLRC
[40]
 
provides the standard to determine whether a worker
is an independent contractor:


âThe applicable law is not
Article 280 of the Labor Code which is cited by petitioners, but Art. 106,
which provides:


âArt. 106.  
Contractor or subcontractor.  
--  Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the
performance of the formerâs work, the employees of the contractor and of the

of this Code.

There is âlabor-onlyâ
contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have
substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries,
work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such
persons are performing activities which are directly related to the principal
business of such employer.  In such
cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the
employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent
as if the latter were directly employed by him.
â  (emphasis
supplied)


In accordance with the above
provision, petitioner corporation is deemed the direct employer of the private
respondents and thus liable for all benefits to which such workers are
entitled, like wages, separation benefits and so forth.  There is no denying the fact that private
respondentsâ work as merchandisers, cashiers, baggers, check-out personnel, sales
ladies, warehousemen and so forth were directly related, necessary and vital to
the day-to-day operations of the supermarket; their jobs involved normal and
regular functions in the ordinary business of the petitioner corporation.  Given the nature of their functions and
responsibilities, it is improbable that petitioner did not exercise direct
control over their work.  Moreover,
there is no evidence--as in fact, petitioners do not even allege--that aside
from supplying the manpower, the labor agencies have âsubstantial capital or
investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among
others.ââ


It is undeniable
that petitionerâs members worked as 
cargadores 
for private
respondent.  They loaded, unloaded and
piled sacks of 
palay
 from the warehouses to the cargo trucks and from
the cargo trucks to the buyers.  This
work is directly related, necessary and vital to the operations of
Corfarm.  Moreover, Corfarm did not even
allege, much less prove, that petitionerâs members have âsubstantial capital or
investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, [and] work premises,
among others.â  Furthermore, said
respondent did not contradict petitionerâs allegation that it paid wages
directly to these workers without the intervention of any third-party
independent contractor.  It also wielded
the power of dismissal over petitioners; in fact, its exercise of this power
was the progenitor of the Second Case.  Clearly,
the workers are not independent contractors.


Applying Article
280
[41]
 of the Labor Code, we hold that the
CPWU members were regular employees of private respondent.  Their tasks were essential in the usual
business of private respondent.


As we have ruled
in an earlier case, the question of whether an employer-employee relationship
exists in a certain situation has bedevilled the courts.  Businessmen, with the aid of lawyers, have
tried to avoid or sidestep such relationship, because that juridical 
vinculum

engenders obligations connected with workmenâs compensation, social security,
medicare, minimum wage, termination pay and unionism.
[42]
 All too familiarly, Respondent
Corfarm sought refuge from these obligations.  However, the records of this case clearly support the existence of the
juridical 
vinculum
. 


RJL Martinez Fishing
Corporation,
[43]
 
cited by the solicitor general, is relevant because
petitionerâs members were also made to wait for âloading and unloadingâ of
cavans of 
palay
 to and from the storage areas and to and from the
milling areas.
[44]
 This waiting time does not
denigrate the regular employment of petitionerâs members.  As ruled in that case:
[45]


âx x x Besides, the
continuity of employment is not the determining factor, but rather whether the
work of the laborer is part of the regular business or occupation of the
employer.(

: Article 281, Labor Code, as amended; Philippine Fishing
Boat Officers and Engineer[s] Union 
vs
. Court of Industrial Relations
,

112 SCRA 159 (1982).  We are thus in
accord with the findings of respondent NLRC in this regard.


Although it may be that
private respondents alternated their employment on different vessels when they
were not assigned to petitionerâs boats, that did not affect their employee
status.  The evidence also establishes
that petitioners had a fleet of fishing vessels with about 65 ship captains,
and as private respondents contended, when they finished with one vessel they
were instructed to wait for the next.  As respondent NLRC had found:


We further find that the
employer-employee relationship between the parties herein is not co-terminous
with each loading and unloading job.  As
earlier shown, respondents are engaged in the business of fishing.  For this purpose, they have a fleet of
fishing vessels.  Under this situation,
respondentsâ activity of catching fish is a continuous process and could hardly
be considered as seasonal in nature.  So
that the activities performed by herein complainants, i.e. unloading the catch
of tuna fish from respondentsâ vessels and then loading the same to
refrigerated vans, are necessary or desirable in the business of
respondents.  This circumstance makes
the employment of complainants a regular one, in the sense that it does not
depend on any specific project or seasonal activity. (
fn
: NLRC Decision,
p. 94, 
Rollo
.)â


Alleged Admission
of Lack of 


Employer-Employee
Relationship


Respondent
Corfarm argues that âsome of petitionerâs members including its president,
Juanito P. Costales, Jr.[,] admitted that they work for various rice mills in
Pangasinan and that there is no employer-employee relations between them and
private respondents.â  It adds that the
solicitor general,  by arguing that
there was an employer-employee relationship, attempts to âsubstitute [his]
judgment [with] that of public respondent  undersecretary  x x x who found
such admissions against self-interest on the part of petitionerâs members x x
x.â
[46]


These arguments
are negligible.  The alleged admissions
cannot be taken against petitionerâs cause.  
First
, the contents of the admissions are highly suspect.  The records reveal that the âadmissionsâ of
Juanito Costales, Jr.,
[47]
 Carlito Costales
[48]
 and Juanito Medenilla
[49]
 were in the form of affidavits
[50]
 of adhesion which were identical in
content, differentiated only by the typewritten names and the signatures of the
workers.  
Second, 
only three of
the workers executed such affidavits.  Clearly, the admissions in such affidavits cannot work against
petitioner unionâs cause.  Such 
pro
forma 
and identical affidavits do not prove lack of employer-employee
relationship against all members of petitioner.  
Third
, the employer-employee relationship is clearly
proven by substantial evidence.  Corfarm
sorely failed to show that petitionerâs members were independent
contractors.  We rule that no particular
form of proof is required to prove the existence of an employer-employee
relationship.  Any competent and
relevant evidence may show the relationship.  If only documentary evidence would be required to demonstrate that relationship,
no scheming employer would ever be brought before the bar of justice.
[51]
 
Fourth
, and in any event,
the alleged admissions of the three workers that they worked with other rice
mills do not work against them.  Assuming 
arguendo
 that they did work with other rice mills, this
was required by the imperative of meeting their basic needs.
[52]


The
employer-employee relationship having been duly established, the holding of a
certification election necessarily follows.  It bears stressing that there should be no unnecessary obstacle to the
holding of such election,
[53]
 for it is a statutory policy that
should not be circumvented.
[54]
 We have held that, in the absence
of a legal impediment, the holding of a certification election is the most
democratic method of determining the employeesâ choice of their bargaining
representative.  It is the best means to
settle controversies and disputes involving union representation.  Indeed, it is the keystone of industrial
democracy.
[55]


Second Case:  
Illegal Dismissal


Petitioner
assails the NLRC for setting aside the labor arbiterâs decision and remanding
the case for further proceedings.  Petitioner argues that the order of remand âwill only prolong the agony
of the 92 union members and their families for living or existing without jobs
and earnings to give them support.â  Further, petitioner contends:
[56]


âThe Labor Arbiter had
rendered a decision (Annex âDâ, Petition) on September 14, 1993 in favor of
petitioner based on the available records of the case after giving more than
ample opportunities to private respondents herein to submit their position
paper and other pleadings alleging their evidences [sic] against the causes of
action of petitioner alleged in the complaint for illegal dismissal, unfair
labor practice, non-payment of various benefits granted by existing laws during
their employment, illegal deductions or diminution of their underpaid daily
wages, non-payment of wage increases and other causes of action pleaded by the
complainant or herein petitioner.


In short, Labor Arbiter
Rolando Gambito rendered his decision based on the records of the case including
evidence available on record and after observing due process of law.â


To support his
opposition against the remand of the case, petitioner recites the chronological
events of the case, 
viz
::
[57]


âIn the case at bar, private
respondents were notified earlier in the latter part of 1992 regarding the
pendency of the complaint for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice,
damages, etc., but said respondents did not appear during the initial hearing
of the case [before] Labor Arbiter Ricardo Olairez, then the Arbiter handling
the case.  The case was re-set for
hearing at some other dates.  On April
22, 1993, Atty. Alfonso C. Bince, Jr. appeared as counsel for respondents at
Dagupan City.  
Atty. Bince committed
to the Labor Arbiter that the former will file the position paper for his
clients (Corfarm Grains, Inc., 
et al
.) within ten (10) days from April
22, 1993, but still private respondentsâ Position Paper was not filed
.


On May 20, 1993, Labor
Arbiter Rolando Gambito, who took over the case for illegal dismissal, etc.
filed by petitioner, 
issued an order to private respondents directing the
latter (respondents) to submit their Position Paper together with THEIR
DOCUMENTARY EXHIBITS, if any, within 10 days from receipt of the order
.  Still, private respondentsâ counsel failed
to submit private respondentâs Position Paper relative to the petitionerâs
complaint for illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, etc. which is involved
in G.R. No. 114911 pending action by this Honorable Court.


Thus, the Labor Arbiter
rendered his decision on the case in favor of petitioner and/or the 92
illegally dismissed workers based on the position paper filed by the latter and
available records of the case.â  (Emphasis
in original.)


On the other hand,
Respondent Corfarm submits that the labor arbiterâs decision should be set
aside not only for âlack of competent and credible evidenceâ but also for lack
of âprocedural due process.â Corfarm further contends that in spite of the
pendency of its motions to cross-examine petitionerâs witnesses and to suspend
proceedings, the labor arbiter ordered the submission of its position paper and
documentary evidence within ten (10) days.
[58]
 Respondent Corfarm insists:
[59]


âIndeed, although
proceedings before a Labor Arbiter are supposed to be non-litigious and the
technicalities in the courts of law need not be strictly applied, the
proceedings should nevertheless be âsubject to the requirements of due processâ
as provided in Section 7, Rule 7 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure.  (See also 
Phil. Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. vs. NLRC, 183 SCRA 451
).â


We agree with
petitioner.  Private respondent was not
denied procedural due process, and the labor arbiterâs decision was based on
competent, credible and substantial evidence.   


Procedural Due
Process Observed


Private
respondent had been duly informed of the pendency of the illegal dismissal
case, but it chose not to participate therein without any known justifiable
cause.  The labor arbiter sent notices
of hearing or arbitration to the parties, requiring them to submit position
papers at 1:30 p.m. on November 14, 1992.
[60]
 Respondent Corfarm did not attend
the hearing.  According to Respondent
NLRC, there was no proof that Respondent Corfarm received such notice.  In any case, petitioner filed a Motion to
Admit Amended Complaint on December 23, 1992.  Again, another notice for hearing or arbitration on January 7, 1993 was
sent to the parties.
[61]
 This was received by petitionerâs
counsel as evidenced by the registry return receipt duly signed by private
respondentâs counsel, Atty. Alfonso Bince, Jr.  It was only on January 28, 1993, however, that Atty. Bince entered his
appearance as counsel for Respondent Corfarm.
[62]
 On May 10, 1993, Corfarm was again
given a new period of ten (10) days within which to submit its position paper
and documentary evidence; âotherwise, [the labor arbiter] will be constrained
to resolve this case based on available evidence on record.â
[63]
 As evidenced by a registry return
receipt, a copy of said directive was received by respondentâs counsel on May
25, 1993.  Still and all, Corfarm failed
to file its position paper.  Clearly,
private respondent was given an opportunity to present its evidence, but it
failed or refused to avail itself of this opportunity without any legal
reason.  Due process is not violated
where a person is given the opportunity to be heard,  but chooses not to give his side of the case.
[64]


Labor Arbiterâs Decision Based


on Credible,
Competent and Substantial Evidence


Contrary to the
conclusions of the NLRC and the arguments of private respondent, the findings
of the labor arbiter on the question of illegal dismissal were based on
credible, competent and substantial evidence. 


It is to be
borne in mind that proceedings before labor agencies merely require the parties
to submit their respective affidavits and position papers.  Adversarial trial is addressed to the sound
discretion of the labor arbiter.  To
establish a cause of action, only substantial evidence is necessary, 
i.e.
,
such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support
a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might conceivably opine
otherwise.
[65]
 As ruled in 
Manalo vs.
Roldan-Confesor
:
[66]


âClear and convincing proof
is âx x x more than mere preponderance, but not to extent of such certainty as
is required beyond reasonable doubt as in criminal cases x x xâ (
fn
:
Blackâs Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 227, citing Fred C. Walker Agency, Inc. 
v.

Lucas, 215 Va. 535, 211 S.E. 2d 88, 92) while substantial evidence âx x x
consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less
than a preponderance x x x xâ (
fn
: 
Ibid.,
 p. 1281, citing Marker 
v.

Finch, D.C. Del., 322 F. Supp. 905, 910)  Consequently, in the hierarchy of evidentiary values, We find proof
beyond reasonable doubt at the highest level, followed by clear and convincing
evidence, preponderance of evidence, and substantial evidence, in that order.â


Evidence to
determine the validity of petitionerâs claims, which the labor arbiter relied
upon, was available to Respondent NLRC.  These pieces of evidence are in the case records, as aptly pointed out
by the solicitor general:
[67]


â[Regarding] the quoted
second sentence of public respondent NLRCâs Resolution that allegations must be
proved and established by competent evidence, and that mere allegations would
not suffice despite the absence of evidence to the contrary, suffice it to say
that there is ample evidence on record to support the Labor Arbiterâs decision,
to wit: 1) Narrative report of DOLE inspector Crisanto Rey Dingle noting some
violation of underpayment of minimum wage and underpayment of 13th month pay
(page 10, record); 2) affidavit of union officers and individual union members,
stating their various claims (page 80-195, Record).  Despite such evidence and an opportunity afforded to private
respondent to present its evidence and position paper as borne out by the
notice of hearing issued by Labor Arbiter Olairez dated November 14, 1992, with
advice to the parties to submit their position paper (p. 14 Record) and the
Order issued by Labor Arbiter Gambito dated May 20, 1993; requiring private
respondents to submit their position paper, together with their documentary
evidence (p. 247, record), private respondent failed to submit its position
paper and countervailing evidence which should have met squarely the
allegations and evidence adduced by the petitioner.  Thus, in the absence of private respondentâs position paper and
countervailing evidence, the Labor Arbiter cannot be faulted in deciding the
case based on the available evidence on record.â


It must be
stressed that labor laws mandate the speedy administration of justice, with
least attention to technicalities but without sacrificing the fundamental
requisites of due process.  In this
light, the NLRC, like the labor arbiter, is authorized to decide cases based on
the position papers and other documents submitted, without resorting to the
technical rules of evidence.
[68]
 Verily, Respondent NLRC noted
several documentary evidence sufficient to arrive at a just decision.  Indeed, the evidence on record clearly
supports the conclusion of the labor arbiter that the petitioners were
employees of respondent, and that they were illegally dismissed.
[69]


The NLRC points
to conflicts and inconsistencies in the evidence on record.  We are not convinced.  These alleged inconsistencies are too flimsy
and too tenuous to preclude a just decision.  The finding that Juanito Costales, Jr. was an employee of respondent was
allegedly inconsistent with his admission that he was the âowner of Carcado
Contracting Services.â  As earlier
observed, the inconsistency is irrelevant.  Juan Costales, Jr. was an employee of Corfarm.  Owning this alleged outfit is not inconsistent with such
employment.  The NLRC also questioned
the amount of the employeesâ compensation.  In one instance, the workers stated that they were âreceiving 
P
45.00
per dayâs work of eight hours.â  In
another, they claimed that they were paid 
P
0.12 per sack or cavan.  These allegedly differ from their allegation
that âCorfarm used to be obliged to pay 
P
57.00 per dayâs earning.â  The alleged inconsistencies are more
apparent than real.  Records reveal that
the 
P
57 was the promised compensation; however, there was an unauthorized
deduction of 
P
12; thus, the amount of 
P
45 per day.
[70]
 The claim of  â
P
0.12 per sack or cavanâ is the
basic computation of how workers or haulers earn their wage for the day.
[71]
 In any event,  the alleged inconsistencies do not affect or
diminish the established fact that petitionerâs members were regular employees
who were illegally dismissed.  


Why Respondent
NLRC refused to rule directly on the appeal escapes us. The remand of a case or
an issue to the labor arbiter for further proceedings is unnecessary,
considering that the NLRC was in a position to resolve the dispute based on the
records before it and particularly where the ends of justice would be served
thereby.
[72]
 Remanding the case would needlessly
delay the resolution of the case which has been pending since 1992.
[73]
 As already observed, the evidence
on record clearly supports the findings of the labor arbiter.


Pursuant to the
doctrine that this Court has a duty to settle, whenever possible,  the entire controversy in a single
proceeding, leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation,
we now resolve all issues.
[74]


It is axiomatic
that in illegal dismissal cases, the employer always has the burden of proof,
[75]
 and his failure to discharge this
duty results in a finding that the dismissal was unjustified.
[76]
 Having defaulted from filing its
position paper, Respondent Corfarm is deemed to have waived its right to
present evidence and counter the allegations of petitionerâs members.  


In the same
light, we sustain the labor arbiterâs holding in respect of unfair labor
practice.
[77]
 As ruled by Labor Arbiter Rolando
D. Gambito:
[78]


âThe last issue:  Instead of sitting down with the individual
complainants or the union officers to discuss their demands, respondents
resorted to mass lay-off of all the members of the union and replaced them with
outsiders.  This is clearly a case of
union busting which Art. 248 of the Labor Code prohibits.  Art. 248 provides that âIt shall be unlawful
for an employer to commit any of the following unfair labor practice (a) To
interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right to
self-organization; (b) x x x (c) To contract out service or functions being
performed by union members when such will interfere with, restrain or coerce
employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization.ââ


In view of
recent jurisprudence,
[79]
 we are correcting some items in the
labor arbiterâs decision.  The
thirteenth month pay awarded should be computed for each year of service from
the time each employee was hired up to the date of his actual
reinstatement.  The same computation
applies to the award of the service incentive leave
[80]
 and underpaid wages.  Each employee is to be paid the remaining
underpaid wages from the date of his or her hiring in accordance with the then
prevailing wage legislations.  Likewise,
a refund of 
P
12 shall be computed for each day of service of each
employee, to be reckoned from the date such employee was hired.  The damages awarded should be sustained
because the employer acted in bad faith.
[81]
 Back wages are to be computed from
the date of dismissal up to the date of actual reinstatement without any
deductions or conditions.  This is in
consonance with 
Fernandez, et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission
:
[82]


âx x x Accordingly, the award
to petitioners of backwages for three years should be modified in accordance
with Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by R.A. 6715, by giving them
full backwages without conditions and limitations, the dismissals having
occurred after the effectivity of the amendatory law on March 21, 1989.  Thus, the Court held in 
Bustamante
:


âThe clear legislative
intent of the amendment in Rep. Act No. 6715 is to give more benefits to
workers than was previously given them under the 
Mercury Drug
 rule or
the âdeduction of earnings elsewhereâ rule.  Thus, a closer adherence to the legislative policy behind Rep. Act No.
6715 points to âfull backwagesâ as meaning exactly that, i.e., without
deducting from backwages the earnings derived elsewhere by the concerned employee
during the period of his illegal dismissal.ââ

The case was deemed submitted for
resolution on September 23, 1996, when the Court received petitionerâs
Manifestation of Compliance dated September 13, 1996, pursuant to the Resolution
of the Court dated August 19, 1996.  The
same Resolution directed private respondent to comment on petitionerâs 
ex
parte
 motion, but due to private respondentâs failure to do so, it is
deemed to have waived the right to do so.

â5.
         
That since June 18, 1992 up to the
present, my co-workers and I were prevented by armed men from entering the
premises of our employer at Caurdanetaan, Umingan, Pangasinan on account of the
formation and organization of our labor union known as the Caurdanetaan Piece
Workers Union, which is duly registered with the Department of Labor and
Employment; that no just, legal and valid cause exists for our employer to
prevent us (workers) from performing our work since June 18, 1992 up to the
present inasmuch as we are regular workers of our employer and for not paying
various pecuniary benefits legally due and payable to us during employment;â
