D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


This is a
petition for 
certiorari
 seeking to set aside the decision
[1]
 of the National Labor Relations
Commission, Third Division, dated November 17, 1992. Said decision reversed the
decision of the Labor Arbiter
[2]
 which found for herein petitioners.


The facts of the
case are as follows:


Private respondent Atlantic Gulf
and Pacific Co. is a construction company engaged, among other things, in
building offshore marine structures for third parties.
[3]


Petitioners were hired by private
respondent by its Offshore and Marine Services Division (OMSD).  They were employed as mechanic, electrician,
welder, painter, equipment operator, rigger, driver, carpenter, pipelifter,
oiler, sandblaster, timekeeper, foreman, welder, clerk, equipment checker, and
other related employment.
[4]


The operations of the OMSD were
based in Poro Point, San Fernando, La Union, where materials needed for private
respondentâs construction activities were fabricated.  This was known as the Poro Point Project.
[5]


Private respondent treated petitioners
as project workers, claiming that the hiring of workers was based on the
availability of project contracts and was thus done on and off.  Workers were hired for definite periods of
time, with tenure depending on the need for each workerâs particular skills.
[6]


Petitioners had been in the service
of private respondent for a period of three to ten years until their
termination on different dates during the period 1973-1976.  They instituted two separate complaints
before the NLRC praying for reinstatement. They alleged that they were
non-project employees who should have become regular employees after completing
one year of service and that, as regular employees, they would have been
entitled to benefits extended to regular employees under the companyâs CBA as
well as to other benefits enjoyed by regular employees. They charged private
respondent with unfair labor practice, declaring that the services of some of
them were terminated after the institution of their complaints.


In 1977, both complaints were archived
upon motion of petitioners to hold hearings on the cases in abeyance. They
filed the motion because at that time an âidentical and analogousâ
[7]
 case (Jose Abuan, 
et al.
 
v
. AG&P,
docketed as NLRC Case No. RBIV-1746-75) was pending appeal in the Office of the
Secretary of Labor.  Deferment of the
hearings was requested âin order to avoid any conflicting decision on the same
facts and the legal and constitutional questions in whatever decision of the
Labor Arbiter might render with that of the Higher Tribunal....â
[8]


The 
Abuan
 case was elevated
to the Supreme Court
[9]
 and was finally decided on July 11, 1980 when this
Court denied for lack of merit the motion filed by petitioners in that case for
reconsideration of the Courtâs earlier resolution
[10]
 denying their petition for certiorari.


On November 10, 1981, petitioners
moved for the revival of these cases.  Petitioners reiterated their motion by filing another motion to revive
the cases on April 8, 1986.  Their
motion could not be resolved, however, as the records could not be located.


On June 2, 1987, a âMotion to
Reconstitute Records of the Above-Entitled Cases or Revival of the Casesâ was
filed by the complainants. By that time, however, the records had been
located.  Consequently, Labor Arbiter
Daisy G. Cauton-Barcelona ordered the records of the cases to be forwarded to
the Region I Arbitration Branch in San Fernando, La Union for further
proceedings.  This was done and, on
August 29, 1991, Labor Arbiter Ricardo Olairez ruled in favor of
petitioners.  He held that petitioners
were non-project employees which, pursuant to Policy Instructions No. 20, were
those employed by construction companies without reference to any particular
project. The Labor Arbiter pointed out that AG&P made petitioners sign
employment contracts every 15th and 30th of every month.  When the contracts were presented to
petitioners for signing, they contained blanks as to the workersâ designation,
rate of wages, duration of employment, the name of the project they were to
work on and the duration of the project. This procedure appeared to be the norm
in private respondentâs company as it continued throughout the duration of
petitionersâ employment whose duration ranged from three to ten years.
[11]


In addition, the Labor Arbiter
found that petitioners continued working for private respondent even when there
were no major projects to work on. The workers performed jobs related to the
maintenance, repair, planning, and programming of both existing and prospective
projects.
[12]


The Labor Arbiter also pointed out
that the petitioners worked continuously for private respondent for three to
ten years.  He cited the service records
submitted by petitioners which showed that their service with AG&P was
unbroken although they were hired in different capacities on different periods.
From the service records, the Labor Arbiter concluded that the petitionersâ
jobs were essential to AG&Pâs business of building offshore and marine
structures and did not depend on any particular project.
[13]


Accordingly, the Labor Arbiter
ordered private respondent to reinstate petitioners and to pay them full
backwages and other benefits equivalent to three years without any deduction or
qualification.  Petitioners were given
the option to avail of separation pay instead, amounting to one month pay for
every year of service including the period when they were supposed to have been
reinstated.  For those who had reached
retirement age during the pendency of the cases, the Labor Arbiter ordered payment
of separation pay equivalent to one month pay per year of service.  The same amount of separation pay was
likewise ordered paid to the heirs of those petitioners who died while the
cases were pending.
[14]


The Labor Arbiter also ordered
private respondent to pay petitioners all the benefits and salary increases
they could have received as regular employees, including those granted under
the CBA, with legal interest of one percent per month compounded annually until
the same are fully and actually paid.  Litigation expenses and attorneyâs fees were likewise ordered paid.
[15]


Private respondent appealed to the
NLRC which reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter in a ruling dated
November 17, 1992. The NLRC cited the case of 
Abuan, et al. v. AG&P

which it said presented substantially the same facts as these cases.  It pointed out that petitioners, like the
complainants in the 
Abuan
 case, also worked in private respondentâs Poro
Point Project with contracts of employment with durations ranging from 15 to 30
days.  The contracts specified the
projects to which the complainants were assigned. The complainants in 
Abuan 
were
separated from employment due to the expiration of their employment
contracts.  The workers in that case
were held to be project employees, and so should it be for the workers in these
cases.


At the same time, however, the NLRC
ordered private respondents to pay petitioners backwages in the amount of
P967,107.00 from July 2, 1992, the date when petitioners filed a motion for
reinstatement, to November 17, 1992, the date of the NLRC decision, for failure
of private respondent AG&P to reinstate them pending appeal.


Petitioners then filed this
petition for certiorari, alleging that the NLRC committed grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in reversing the Labor Arbiterâs
decision based on the principle of 
stare decisis
.
[16]


Petitioners assert that the NLRC
should have ruled on the issue of whether or not the workers were regular
employees based on the available evidence instead of merely invoking 
stare
decisis
.


The petition is without merit.


First.  
Petitioners themselves
asserted in their motion to suspend proceedings before the Labor Arbiter that
they were asking for a deferment of the hearings because of the pendency of the
âidentical and analogousâ
[17]
 case of 
Jose Abuan, et al. v. AG&P
 âto
avoid any conflicting decision on the same facts and the legal and
constitutional questions in whatever decision of the Labor Arbiter might render
with that of the Higher Tribunal....â


The NLRC ruled in 
Abuan
 that
the workers involved therein were project employees.  It found that â[t]he records [of the case] show the specific
projects to which complainants have been assigned.â  Such projects had been terminated by the time of the workersâ
separation from the service. The absence of new construction projects, and thus
the lack of work for which they may be rehired, was not disputed by the
workers.  This decision was affirmed on
appeal by the Secretary of Labor and the Office of the President.  This Court denied the petition for certiorari
seeking to set aside that decision.
[18]


The NLRC pointed out that
petitioners themselves had admitted the similarity between their case and the 
Abuan

case. Hence, 


Applying the principle of 
stare
decisis
, the instant complaints should be dismissed.  
Stare decisis
 declares that, for the
sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those
which follow, if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties
may be different.
[19]


Indeed, the facts and the questions
involved in 
Abuan
 and the present case are the same.  Petitioners themselves did admit as much
when they filed their motion to hold hearings in abeyance pending the final
determination of the issues in 
Abuan
, to avoid any conflict in the
decisions in the two cases.


The workers in 
Abuan
 and the
petitioners were all hired to work in private respondentâs Poro Point Project,
and were attached to private respondentâs Offshore and Marine Services
Division.


The workers in the 
Abuan

case were engaged by AG&P to work as supervisor, engineer, paymaster,
carpenter, warehouseman, clerk, painter, equipment checker, electrician,
accountant, personnel officer, and timekeeper.  Except for the supervisor, engineer, accountant, and personnel officer 
Â¾
 which made up 17 out of the 37 workers therein 
Â¾
 the workers in the 
Abuan
 case had essentially the same nature of
employment as petitioners.  Petitioners
worked for private respondent as foreman, warehouseman, rigger, carpenter,
oiler, clerk, machinist, electrician, sandblaster, equipment checker, and
similar types of employment.  They were
mostly performing manual work.


Like the workers in 
Abuan
,
petitioners in this  case  also had contracts with periods ranging from
15 days to 30 days.  The contracts of
both sets of workers were renewed several times such that the workers spent
more than a year working for private respondent.  The workers in 
Abuan
 as well as the petitioners were
separated from the service upon the completion of the projects to which they
were assigned.  After such separation,
they filed separate complaints seeking the same relief: recognition of their
regular status, their reinstatement and payment of salaries and benefits due
regular workers. Thus the workers in 
Abuan
 and petitioners in the
present case were similarly situated.


Petitioners herein, like the
workers in 
Abuan
, are project employees, assigned to work in a
particular construction project.
[20]
 They are workers whose employment has been fixed for
a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has
been determined at the time of their engagement.
[21]


In the proceedings before the Labor
Arbiter, however, petitioners claimed in an affidavit that private respondent
made them sign blank employment contracts.  This implied that the project to which they would be assigned as well as
the duration and termination thereof was not determined at the time of their
engagement.  A similar assertion made by
workers in 
Abuan
 was rejected by the NLRC.


There is clearly
no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in applying the rule in 
Abuan

to these cases. The NLRCâs decision in 
Abuan 
  was based on the same facts and issues present in this case. It
was but proper and logical for the NLRC to arrive at  the same conclusions in the two cases.


The Solicitor
General cites the case of 
Caramol v. NLRC
[22]
 
to support his contention that petitioners are
regular employees.  In that case,
petitioner Rogelio Caramol, was employed by AG&P on a project-to-project
basis. His employment was renewed 44 times by AG&P.   He was not re-admitted by the company after
he participated in a strike in 1986.  Throughout Caramolâs 13-year employment with AG&P, he continued to
perform the same kind of work as a rigger.  This Court held that this clearly showed that Caramol was a regular
employee, his work being usually necessary or desirable in the usual business
or trade of his employer, considering his successive contracts with AG&P
and the fact that he was doing only one type of work.


However, this
case differs materially from the case of Caramol. While in 
Caramol
 the
worker was engaged in only one type of work, the petitioners herein performed
different types of work throughout the duration of their employment.  As the Labor Arbiter found in this case,
each of the petitioners was employed in various capacities, as follows:
[23]


The service record of Domingo Abad
(Annex âAâ) shows that he started work with respondent company as an 
Unskilled
Laborer
 from December 10, 1970 to February 1, 1971.  This was followed by a series of services as

Junior Mechanic
 all the way from May 2, 1971 to November 20, 1971, then
from November 21, 1971 to June 28, 1972, from June 29, 1972 to December 20,
1972, then from December 21, 1972 to December 16, 1973.


For a duration of three (3) years,
there was only one instance when there was a short break, from February 2, 1971
to May 2, 1971, or a break of three (3) months. After his initial service of
almost two (2) months as 
unskilled laborer
, there was a break of three
(3) months, then an unbroken service as 
Junior Mechanic
 of almost three
(3) years.


Another service record marked as
Annex âA-9â is that of Jose P. Casuga, Jr.  He started as an 
Unskilled Laborer
 and worked as such from
October 16, 1969 to December 12, 1971.  Without a break, this was followed by a series of services as 
Watchman

and as 
Junior Mechanic
 up to his last day of service on September 27,
1973, an unbroken service of four (4) years.


One service record, that of
Seninando Galvez (Annex âA-23â) shows a period of employment with respondent of
three (3) years from April 13, 1966 to February 28, 1969, when he was allegedly
laid off and another two (2) years from April 4 , 1972 to March 31, 1974, when
he was laid off again.


That of Jose L. Sotto (Annex
âA-36â) shows an unbroken service of more than five (5) years starting from
April 27, 1968 ending on September 6, 1973 as 
Junior Mechanic
 and then
as 
Machinist II
.


That of Mauro M. Quilates (Annex
âA-39â) also has an unbroken service record of nine (9) years from March 14,
1966 to June 16, 1975, as 
Carpenter
, 
Pipe-fitter
 and as 
Fitter/Cutter
.


Another complainant, Benjamin
Subala (Annex âA-43â) has served respondent company also for an unbroken period
of more than six (6) years, from April 6, 1967 to September 26, 1973, as 
Sandblaster
,

Leadman Sandblaster
, then as 
Sub-Foreman Blaster
.


That of Mariano M. Balagat (Annex
âA-6â) has a record of unbroken service of eight (8) years from September 1966
to October 16, 1974 as 
Weldor B
 then as 
Weldor A
.


Complainant Alejandro Campos (Annex
âA-16â) had served respondent company for a period of four (4) years without
any break, initially as 
Unskilled Laborer
, then a 
Boiler Operator
,
and finally as
 Mechanic
.


Ferdinand Casuga (Annex âA-10â) has
a service record of three (3) years from March 9, 1972 to December 22, 1975,
with a 3-1/2 months break.


Sixto Dato, Sr. (Annex âA-18â) has
a long service record of nine (9) years from December 1966 to March 31, 1975
without any single break, working as 
Heavy Equipment Operator
 all
throughout his employment. (emphasis supplied)


Thus, it is
clear from the foregoing that each of the petitioners, or at least a majority
of them, was hired in different capacities during different periods of their
employment with private respondent.  This is an indication that petitioners were indeed hired based on
private respondentâs need for a workerâs particular skills.


A case similar
to 
Caramol
 is that of 
Samson v. NLRC
.
[24]
 This case again involved private
respondent and one of its workers who worked for the company as rigger for more
than 20 years.  We ruled, as in 
Caramol
,
that he was a regular employee.


Second
.  Petitioner filed this petition for certiorari without first filing a
motion for reconsideration of the assailed decision.


The rule is that
a petition for certiorari may be filed in case a tribunal, board or officer
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess
of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess
of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[25]


Applied to the
decisions of the NLRC, this means  that
a motion for reconsideration must be filed within ten days from a partyâs
receipt of a copy of the decision.
[26]
 The filing of a motion for
reconsideration of the decision of the NLRC is a prerequisite for availing of
the remedy of a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court.
[27]
 Petitionersâ failure to file such a
motion is fatal to their petition.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DENIED and the decision of the NLRC is
AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
