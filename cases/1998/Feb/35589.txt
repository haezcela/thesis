PANGANIBAN, J.:


To stay the
execution pending appeal of a judgment in an ejectment suit, the Rules require
the defendant to file a supersedeas bond.  What is the nature of this bond?  How is the amount to be computed?  In what court should it be presented?  At what point in the litigation should it be filed?


The Case


The Court
answers the foregoing questions as it resolves this petition for review on 
certiorari

assailing the December 15, 1993 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 32236, which
disposed as follows:
[3]


âWHEREFORE, the petition is
GRANTED, the orders dated June 10, 1993 and June 17, 1993 are SET ASIDE, and
respondent court is ORDERED to issue a writ of execution for the enforcement of
the decision dated March 5, 1993 rendered by the Municipal Trial Court in Civil
Case No. 2592, insofar as the right to the possession of the lots is
concerned.â


Petitioners also
challenge the February 15, 1994 Resolution of Respondent Court which denied
their motion for reconsideration.
[4]


The Facts


The facts of
this case are undisputed.  As found by
Respondent Court, they are as follows:
[5]


âComing now to the merits
of the case, it appears that on March 5, 1993, the Municipal Trial Court (branch
II) of Batangas City rendered judgment for petitioners [private respondents
herein] with respect to four lots located in Galicano St., Batangas City,
ordering the ejectment of private respondents [petitioners herein] and ordering
them to pay monthly rentals of 
P
50,000.00 starting April 7, 1992 until
they shall have vacated the lots and surrendered their possession to
petitioners and the sum of 
P
20,000.00 as attorneyâs fees.


It appears further that a
copy of the decision was received by private respondentsâ counsel on March 10,
1993; that on March 11, 1993 he filed a notice of appeal; and that on March 16,
1993, the MTC ordered the records of the case transmitted to the RTC.


On March 29, 1993,
petitioners moved for the execution of the decision in their favor, alleging
that although private respondents had filed a notice of appeal, the latter had
not filed a supersedeas bond nor make [sic] a deposit every month of the
reasonable value of the use and occupation of the properties as required by
Rule 70, sec. 8.


Private respondents opposed
the motion, claiming that they are co-owners of the lots from which they were
ordered to be ejected and that to grant immediate execution of the decision
would render their appeal moot and academic.  They later filed a supplement to their opposition, claiming that while
they were after all willing to file a supersedeas bond, but that they had been
kept busy attending to their businesses and thus unable to secure a bond.


On June 10, 1993, the trial
court issued the first of its disputed orders in which it denied petitionersâ
motion for execution on the ground that the transmission by the MTC of the
records of the ejectment case to the RTC, without waiting for the expiration of
the period of appeal, prevented private respondents from filing a supersedeas
bond on time.  The order reads:


WHEREFORE, premises
considered, the urgent Motion for Execution filed by plaintiff-appellees is
hereby DENIED for lack of merit.  Accordingly, the defendant appellants are hereby directed to:


a)
     
To
file with this Court a supersedeas bond in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY
THOUSAND (
P
550,000.00) PESOS within five days from receipt of this
Order;


b)
     
To
deposit, within the period afore-mentioned, an amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
THOUSAND (
P
150,000.00) PESOS by way of accrued rentals for the months of
April, May and June, 1993; and


c)
     
To
periodically deposit on or before the tenth day of each succeeding months
[sic], starting from July 1993, and an [sic] amount of FIFTY THOUSAND (
P
50,000.00)
PESOS representing the reasonable monthly rental fixed by the lower court.â


On June 17,
1993, the RTC issued another order giving petitioners an extension of five days
within which to file a supersedeas bond.  After initially admitting a cash bond of 
P
550,000, the RTC
granted on September 20, 1993 petitionersâ motion for the substitution of the
cash bond with a surety bond.  Private
respondents filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals,
questioning the said three orders.


Respondent Courtâs Ruling


Invoking Section
8, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, Respondent Court ruled that the RTC erred in
extending the period for filing a supersedeas bond.  This error was compounded when the same court issued its second
order on June 17, 1993 which gave herein petitioners an additional extension of
five days within which to do so.  The
Court of Appeals held that the said provision was mandatory and gave the said
trial court no discretion with regard to its application.  In dismissing petitionersâ claim that they
did not know where to file the supersedeas bond, the Court of Appeals noted
that said argument was made for the first time on appeal before it,  petitionersâ opposition to the motion for
execution before the RTC being based only on their alleged co-ownership of the
said property.  Respondent Court also
distinguished the present case from 
Laurel vs. Abalos,
[6]
 holding that there was no basis for
the application of an exception to the mandatory provision of Section 8 of Rule
70. 


While sustaining
the order of September 20, 1993, Respondent Court set aside the two other
orders issued on June 10 and 17, 1993.  Subsequently, said Court denied the motion for reconsideration.  


Hence, this
petition for review.
[7]
 In a Resolution dated March 11,
1996, this Court noted that petitioners had no objection to the substitution of
the deceased Mariano Moreno by his surviving heirs.
[8]


The Issues


Petitioners
allege that the Court of Appeals committed the following âerrorsâ:
[9]


âI


The Court of Appeals committed a grave error of law when it found that
petitioners herein, the private respondents in C.A. G.R. SP NO. 32236, could
have filed the supersedeas bond on time and before June 10, 1993 when RTC,
Branch I of Batangas City fixed for the first time the amount of supersedeas
bond which ruling, if implemented, would have condoned and would have resulted
to the violation of the 
equal protection clause of the Constitution
.


II


The Court of Appeals committed grave error of law when it made grossly
erroneous conclusions arising from admitted and undisputed facts which led the
said Court of Appeals to apply the general rule as stated in 
Section 8 
of

Rule 70 
of the 
Rules of Court 
and not the law on exceptions to
said rule.


III


The Court of Appeals committed grave error of law in making findings of
fact contrary to the admitted and proven facts by the petitioners and private
respondents in C.A. G.R. SP. No. 32236 and not supported by evidence on record.


IV


The Court of Appeals committed an error of law when it ordered the RTC, Branch
I of Batangas City to issue a writ of execution which, if implemented, would
necessarily result to the deprivation of petitioners herein of their property
without due process of law in violation of 
Section 1, Article III 
of the

Constitution.
â


In the main, the
case hinges on whether, after the expiration of the period for perfecting said
appeal,  the RTC had the authority to
set the amount of and accept a supersedeas bond to stay the immediate execution
of a decision in an ejectment suit pending appeal.  This encompasses several questions regarding the nature of a
supersedeas bond: What is the amount of the bond? Who, if any, determines the
amount?  Where and at what point in the
litigation should the bond be filed?  We
shall deal with each of these questions.


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
not meritorious.


Main Issue:  
Late
Filing of the Supersedeas Bond


The applicable
rule in this case is Section 8, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, which provides:
[10]


âSEC. 8.  
Immediate execution of judgment.  How to stay same.  
If judgment is rendered against the defendant, execution
shall issue immediately, unless an appeal has been perfected and the defendant
to stay execution files a sufficient bond, approved by the municipal or city
court and executed to the plaintiff to enter the action in the Court of First
Instance and to pay the rents, damages, and costs accruing down to the time of
the judgment appealed from, and unless, during the pendency of the appeal, he
deposits with the appellate court the amount of rent due from time to time
under the contract, if any, as found by the judgment of the municipal or city
court to exist.  In the absence of a
contract, he shall deposit with the court the reasonable value of the use and
occupation of the premises for the preceding month or period at the rate
determined by the judgment, on or before the tenth day of each succeeding month
or period.  The supersedeas bond shall
be transmitted by the municipal or city court, with the other papers, to the
clerk of the Court of First Instance to which the action is appealed.


x x x
                                             
x x
x

xâ


As a general
rule, a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in an ejectment suit is immediately
executory, in order to prevent further damage to him arising from the loss of
possession of the property in question.
[11]
 To stay the immediate execution of
the said judgment while the appeal is pending, the foregoing provision requires
that the following requisites must concur:  (1) the defendant perfects his appeal; (2) he files a supersedeas bond;
and (3) he periodically deposits the rentals which become due during the
pendency of the appeal.
[12]
 The failure of the defendant to
comply with 
any
 of these conditions is a ground for the 
outright
execution
 of the judgment, the duty of the court in this respect being
âministerial and imperative.â
[13]
 Hence, if the defendant-appellant
perfected the appeal but failed to file a supersedeas bond, the immediate
execution of the judgment would automatically follow.  Conversely, the filing of a supersedeas bond will not stay the
execution of the judgment if the appeal is not perfected.  Necessarily then, the supersedeas bond
should be filed within the period for the perfection of the appeal.


In the present
case, petitioners filed their notice of appeal on March 11, 1993, a day after
their receipt of the MTCâs decision.  On
March 16, 1993, or five days later, the MTC transmitted the records of the case
to the RTC.  On March 29, 1993, the
private respondents filed a motion for the immediate execution of the
decision.  As noted earlier, petitioners
opposed the motion on the ground that they were co-owners of the property.  On June 10, 1993, the RTC denied the motion
for execution and directed petitioners to file a supersedeas bond.  On the authority of the RTC order, petitioners
filed a cash bond, which was later substituted with a surety bond.


We agree with
the Court of Appeals that the bond was filed out of time.  The motion for execution was filed eighteen
days from the date the petitioners received a copy of the MTCâs decision,  after the appeal had already been
perfected.  Because no supersedeas bond
had been filed within the period for appeal, a writ of execution should have
been issued as a matter of right.  Petitioners manifestly failed to adduce a compelling reason to justify a
departure from the aforecited rule.


Petitioners
contend that the delay should be excused because the MTC, without fixing the
amount of the bond, transmitted the records of the case to the RTC even before
the perfection of the appeal,
[14]
 
i.e.,
 the expiration of the
period for filing an appeal.
[15]
 Hence, they did not know whether to
file a bond with the RTC or with the MTC.  Neither were they certain of the amount of the bond. 


How the Amount of Supersedeas 


Bond Is Determined


Petitioners need
not require the MTC to fix the amount of the supersedeas bond.  They could have computed this
themselves.  As early as 1947, we have
held in 
Aylon vs. Jugo and De Pablo
 that the supersedeas bond is
equivalent to the amount of rentals, damages and costs stated in the judgment:
[16]


âx x x.  Under the provisions of Section 8 of the
Rule, a justice of the peace or a municipal court may require the defendant to
file a bond for an amount which would cover the stipulated 
rentals, as found
by the judgment of the Court
, or the 
reasonable value for the use and
occupation of the premises, at the rate determined by the judgment, damages and
costs
 down to the time of the final judgment in the action.  The reasonable value for the use and
occupation of the premises, the possession of which is sought to be recovered,
is that fixed by the Court in the judgment, because the rental stipulated in
the contract of lease that has expired or terminated may no longer be the
reasonable value for the use and occupation of the premises as a result or by
reason of the change or rise in values.  But the bond together with the appeal is only to prevent the immediate
execution of a judgment rendered against the defendant in forcible entry and
detainer cases.  Such execution must be
prevented further by paying to the plaintiff or depositing with the Court of
First Instance, during the pendency of the appeal, the stipulated rental due
from time to time under the contract, as found by the judgment of the Court,
or, in the absence of a contract, the reasonable value for the use and
occupation of the premises for the preceding month, on or before the tenth day
of each calendar month, at the rate determined by the judgment.â  (Underscoring supplied).


Under Section 8
of Rule 70, the supersedeas bond shall be equivalent to the unpaid rentals,
damages and costs which accrued before the decision was rendered, as determined
by the MTC in the said decision.
[17]
 The bond does not answer for
amounts accruing during the pendency of the appeal, which are, in turn, the
subject of the periodic deposits to be made by the defendant.
[18]


In the present
case, the MTC clearly stated in its March 5, 1993 decision that petitioners
should pay rentals of 
P
50,000 a month from April 7, 1992 until they
shall have vacated the lots.  The amount
comprising the supersedeas bond and the periodic deposits, therefore, is
evident and computable from the MTCâs decision. 


Where Is the 


Supersedeas Bond Filed?


In the light of
the peculiar circumstances of this case, petitioners allege that they could not
determine whether to file the supersedeas bond with the MTC or the RTC.  Thus, they argue:
[19]


â28.
    
In the facts of the dispute involved in his petition, the court
of origin cannot fix the amount of supersedeas bond since the records are no
longer with it.   The RTC on the other
hand cannot fix the amount of supersedeas bond since the appeal has not yet
been perfected and, after the same has been perfected, the unlawful detainer
case records or 
expediente 
(case folder) must first pass through several
administrative processes such as docketing, checking for completeness of 
expediente
,
raffle and finally taking âcognizanceâ or initial action of the said appeal by
the branch of the RTC to which it was raffled.â


Petitionersâ
submissions are meritless.  As earlier observed,
there is no need for either the MTC or the RTC to fix the amount of the
supersedeas bond, the same being manifest in the face of the MTCâs
decision.  Moreover, petitioner failed
to file the bond on time not because they did not know where to file it, but
because they believed that they should not do so.  Hence, their opposition to the motion for execution was based on
their alleged co-ownership of the property.  It was only before the Court of Appeals that they claimed confusion on
where the bond should be filed.  The
Court of Appeals discarded petitionersâ argument in this wise:


âTheir claim that they did
not know where to file the supersedeas bond is being made only now.  Indeed, in opposing petitionersâ motion for
execution they based their opposition not on this ground but on the claim that
since they were claiming to be co-owners of the lots in question, their claim
would be rendered moot and academic if execution were ordered pending
appeal.  It is, therefore, not true that
they were prevented from filing a supersedeas bond because the MTC transmitted
the records of the case to the RTC before the expiration of private
respondentsâ period of appeal.â


Petitioners also
argue that 
Laurel vs. Abalos
[20]
 
should be applied here. In that case, this Court held
that â[w]here supervening events occurring subsequent to the judgment bring
about a material change in the situation of the parties, which makes the
execution inequitable, or where there is no compelling urgency for the
execution because it is not justified by the prevailing circumstances, the
court may stay immediate execution of the judgment.â
[21]
 They also allege that the
âimmediate execution of judgment of the inferior court will cause irreparable
injury
[22]
 to the petitioners herein who stand
to lose their home, business and source of livelihood x x x.â
[23]


We are not
persuaded.  We do not find in this case
any supervening circumstance or any material change in the situation of the
parties, which would render inequitable the immediate execution of the judgment
pending appeal.  We agree with the
disquisition of Respondent Court on this point:


âIt is also argued that
this case falls under the exception to the rule making Rule 70, sec. 8
mandatory because of supervening events which bring about a material change in
the situation of the parties and make the execution pending appeal inequitable
or because there is no urgency for the execution under the circumstances.


The case in which this
exception was applied was that of 
Laurel v. Abalos, 
30 SCRA 281 (1969).  The present case is, however, a far cry from
that case.  In 
Laurel v. Abalos 
there
was probability that the plaintiff in the ejectment case would lose the
property and therefore, his right to eject the defendant became doubtful
because, while the appeal of the defendant was pending, another court declared
the plaintiffâs title to be null and void at the instance of plaintiffsâ
predecessor-in-interest.  In the present
case, no such probability exists.  What
is there is only an allegation by private respondentsâ ejectment suit, that
they are co-owners of the lots in question.  What is noteworthy in this case is that the titles to the lots are in
the names of petitioners and, except for the claim of ownership put up as a
defense by the defendants, there is otherwise no action questioning the
validity of petitionersâ titles.  Indeed
no heirs of Chua Hai has ever claimed ownership of the lots in question.


There is, therefore, no
basis for private respondentsâ contention that because of a supervening event --
of which there is none -- there is no compelling necessity for ordering
execution of the decision in the ejectment case based on private respondentsâ
failure to file a supersedeas bond and deposit the monthly rentals within the
time provided by law.â


The allegation
of Petitioner Marciano Chua that he, as a co-owner of the subject property, has
filed an action for partition does not constitute a compelling reason to
further delay the execution of the judgment.  
 
An ejectment suit is
conclusive only on the issue of material possession or possession 
de facto 
of
the property under litigation, 
[24]
 not on the issue of ownership.  Section 7
[25]
 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court is
clear on this:


âSEC. 7.
         
Judgment conclusive only on
possession; not conclusive in actions involving title or ownership.  
--  The judgment rendered in an action for forcible entry or detainer shall
be effective with respect to the possession only and in no wise bind the title
or affect the ownership of the land or building.  Such judgment shall not bar an action between the same parties
respecting title to the land or building, nor shall it be held conclusive of
the facts therein found in a case between the same parties upon a different
cause of action not involving possession.â


The pendency of
the action for partition, where ownership is one of the principal issues, does
not preclude the execution of the judgment in the ejectment suit.  Such action for partition is entirely
independent of the ejectment suit.
[26]
 On the other hand, the issue of ownership
is considered in an ejectment suit only for the limited purpose of determining
who between the contending parties has the better right to possession.
[27]
 Moreover, it should be stressed
that we are not being called upon here to decide which of the parties has a
better right of possession, let alone, a better title to the property.  The only issue in this case is whether or
not a writ of execution should be issued 
pending appeal of the ejectment
suit
.  


In any event, it
is erroneous to characterize the partition suit as a compelling reason to stay
the execution of the judgment pending appeal.  On the contrary, the fact that the titles to the disputed lots are in
the name of Private Respondent Mariano C. Moreno, and not in the name of
petitioners or their father Chua Hai, justifies the transfer of possession of
the said property to the private respondents, at least during the appeal.  The question of âirreparable injuryâ to
petitioners, on the other hand, cannot be discussed at this forum,  for this Court is not a trier of facts.
[28]
 In any case, this question of
âirreparable injuryâ is, at best, speculative and conjectural, and deserves no
further disquisition.


Coming back to
the original question, the bond should be filed before the MTC or, where the
records have been forwarded to the RTC, before the latter court.  In either case, it should be done during the
period of appeal. 


Secondary Issue:


Deprivation of
Property Without Due Process


Petitioners
submit that they are âthe exclusive and absolute owners of successful and
profit[-]generating businesses located in [the] parcel of land in
question.â  Thus, if the judgment of
ejectment is to be executed, private respondents will get possession not only
of the parcel of land, but also of the improvements thereon which are integral
to the business of petitioners.
[29]
 They further argue that the rights
of the petitioners over the improvements located in the land are still to be
resolved in the ejectment suit on appeal and in the partition case.
[30]


Petitionersâ
submissions are irrelevant.  In the
first place, the present case involves only the propriety of issuing a writ of
execution 
pending the appeal
.  It
is not conclusive on the right of possession of the land
[31]
 -- let alone the improvements
therein
[32]
 -- which is the main issue in the
appealed ejectment suit.  In the second
place, any of the perceived injuries to their business could have been avoided
by the simple expedient of filing a supersedeas bond pursuant to Section 8 of
Rule 70.  Petitioners had an opportunity
to file the bond, but they did not do so on time.  They cannot now complain of alleged deprivation of property
without due process. 


In an action for
ejectment or for recovery of possession of real property, it is well-settled
that the defendantâs claims for the value of the improvements on the property
or necessary expenses for its preservation should be interposed as compulsory
counterclaims.

Court, however, the prevailing rule states that âa partyâs appeal by notice of
appeal is deemed perfected as to him 
upon the filing of the notice of appeal

in due time.â (Rule 41, Â§. 9.)

According to petitioners, immediate execution of judgment
will result in the following:


âa.
         
Dispossession
of the petitioners herein of the parcels of land which, according to their
knowledge, are theirs by virtue of their inheritance.


b.
          
Dispossession
of the petitioners herein of their business and property established,
maintained and made a success through their own hard labor and thriftiness, and
which business are [sic] the sole source of livelihood of the petitioners
herein inclusive of the members of their family.


c.
          
Dispossession
of the petitioners herein and their family of their homes built through their
own labor, sweat and blood without any other alternative to go to.


d.
          
Giving to
the private respondents herein possession of the entirety of the land in
question which they will not be able to oversee personally since they live in
Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila.


e.
          
Giving to
the private respondents herein the successful business and property of the
petitioners herein without even said private respondents doing anything to put
up said business and property thereby depriving the petitioners of their
property and source of livelihood.


f.
           
Giving to
the private respondents herein dwelling places they may not even use for they
live in their own house at Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila.


g.
          
Worse, in the event
that the petitioners herein are upheld in their action for partition pending
before and to be decided by the branch of Regional Trial Court which is the
same court that was called to order the immediate execution of the judgment of
the inferior court, the private respondents herein will lose their right to
eject the petitioners herein who in turn will be declared co-owners of the
parcels of lands in question.  Thus, the
court 
a quo 
will then be constrained to put the petitioners herein in
possession of the parcels of lands they inherited from their father, Chua Hai,
the business and property they established and maintained through their own
hard labor, and the homes they have known as theirs for so long
