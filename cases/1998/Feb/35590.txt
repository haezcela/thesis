MENDOZA, J.:


This is an
appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court, 8th Judicial Region in
Palo, Leyte convicting accused-appellants Eduardo âEddieâ Robedillo and
Anacleto âYontongâ Novio, together with Artemio âArtemâ Yepes (now deceased),
of murder and sentencing each one to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua 
and jointly and severally to indemnify the heirs of the victim
Martiano Cinco the sum of 
P
30,000.00.


The information in this case alleged -


That on or about the 30th
day of May, 1988, in the Municipality of Tolosa, Province of Leyte, Philippines
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused,
with decided intent to kill, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each
other, with treachery and taking advantage of superior strength, did, then and
there wilfully, and feloniously attack, assault, stab and hack one Martiano
Cinco, with the use of bladed weapons which the accused had provided themselves
for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon said Martiano Cinco wounds on the
head, chest and back, which wounds directly caused his death shortly
thereafter.
[1]


Charged in the
information were Eduardo âEddieâ Robedillo, Artemio âArtemâ Yepes, Artemio
âArtemâ Novio, and Anacleto âYontongâ Novio.  Trial proceeded as to all except Artemio âArtemâ Novio who was and, to
this date, remains at large.


The prosecution
presented two eyewitnesses: Sammy Cinco, the then 16-year old son of the
victim, and Eufrocina Cinco, the victimâs common-law wife.


Sammy Cinco
testified
[2]
 that at about 4 p.m. on May 30,
1988, he and his father, Martiano Cinco, went to the house of Felicisimo Novio
upon invitation of Artemio Novio who said there was a party in that house. It
turned out that among the other guests invited were the four accused.


Sammy said that,
after eating, he decided to wait for his father outside the house and sat down
under a jackfruit tree nearby.  Shortly
thereafter, he saw his father jump out of the house through  the  balcony and run  past him.  He  was being pursued by the four accused who were all armed with
bolos.  Sammy noticed that his father
had been wounded on the back and  was
profusely bleeding.  The four caught up
with his father in the nearby ricefield.  From where he had hidden behind some ornamental plants, Sammy saw his
father kneeling with both hands raised, pleading for mercy as he was surrounded
by his captors.  


That was to be
his fatherâs last deliberate act.  Artemio and Anacleto Novio started the assault directly from the front,
followed closely by Eduardo Robedillo with hacking blows to the victimâs
right.  From behind, Artemio Yepes
stabbed Martiano Cinco on the back.  The
four then took turns striking Martiano until he fell down to the ground face
first.


After witnessing
the gory scene, Sammy fled home to report the incident to his brother.


Eufrocina Cinco
testified next.
[3]
 She said that at the time of the
incident, she was home doing household chores.  Their house was only about 100 meters from the house to which her husband
and Sammy had gone.  Hearing people
shout, she went out of the house and saw her husband Martiano Cinco in a
kneeling position, 80 meters away, with his hands up as the four accused, all
armed with bolos, surrounded him.  Eufrocina could not stand the sight and so covered her eyes.  But later she summoned enough courage and
managed to look.  She saw the four men
hacking away at their victim.  She saw
Martiano hit the ground, as accused-appellant Robedillo continued attacking her
husband even after the other three had left. Robedillo then walked towards
Eufrocinaâs house and shouted, âWho else is aggrieved?â Eufrocina managed to
say, âEduardo, that is enough as you have already killed my husband.â  Eufrocina said she suspected Robedillo to
have harbored some resentment against her husband because the latter had filed
a complaint against Robedillo for theft of a pig.


Eventually, the
wife of the said accused-appellant came and took him away.  This allowed Eufrocina to report Martianoâs killing
to the police.


Dr. Alicia S.
Songalia, Municipal Health Officer of Tolosa, Leyte, conducted the post-mortem
examination.  She found that the victim
had suffered 11 wounds in various parts of the body.
[4]
 Her report (Exh. A) contained the
following findings:

CAUSE OF DEATH:  HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK, secondary multiple stab
wounds.
[5]


Artemio âArtemâ
Yepes testified on his behalf, basically claiming alibi in his defense.
[6]
 On the other hand,  Eduardo âEddieâ Robedillo did not testify or
give evidence on his behalf, although he was represented by counsel.
[7]


Accused-appellant
Anacleto âYontongâ Novio took the stand denying any part in the killing of
Martiano Cinco on May 12, 1988.
[8]
 He claimed that in the afternoon in
question, while he was in the balcony of his motherâs house, about two meters
away from the house of his brother Felicisimo, he saw Martiano coming out of
the front door of his brotherâs residence, followed by accused-appellant
Robedillo and by Artemio Novio who came out of the kitchen door.  Robedillo and Novio were pursuing the
deceased.  Accused-appellant said he ran
after the two, who are his nephews, and shouted at them  to stop their chase after he saw that they
were armed with bolos, but the two did not heed him.


Accused-appellant
said he had no reason to kill Martiano Cinco, who was his neighbor and friend,
and claimed that he was falsely accused by Eufrocina Cinco because he had
stabbed her first husband as a result of an altercation in 1982.  He said that the incident was settled
amicably.


The trial court
found the three (Eduardo Robedillo, Artemio Yepes and Anacleto Novio) guilty as
charged and accordingly sentenced them as above indicated.  Hence this appeal.  


A death
certificate issued by the local civil registrar of Tolosa, Leyte submitted by
accused-appellantsâ former counsel states accused-appellant Artemio Yepes died
in September 1989, the same month the decision of the trial court was
promulgated.
[9]
 On the other hand, it would seem
that although accused-appellant Eduardo Robedillo is in custody, he has not
been ordered committed to the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila
as required by Circular No. 4-92-A of this Court.  It also appears from the record that Anacleto Novio jumped bail
and, although warrants for his arrest were issued by the trial court on
November 21, 1989 and January 22, 1990, he has not been apprehended.
[10]
 There is no mention in the records
whether his bail bond has been ordered forfeited.  Pursuant to Rule 125, Â§1 in relation to Rule 124, Â§8, his appeal
should be dismissed.  The appeal of
accused-appellant Artemio Yepes should likewise be dismissed as a consequence
of his death.  This leaves the appeal of
accused-appellant Eduardo Robedillo alone.


Accused-appellant
raises one issue in his assignment of error, namely:


THE COURT A 
QUO 
GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING
THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF MURDER INSTEAD OF THE LESSER OFFENSE OF HOMICIDE.


Accused-appellant
invokes the ruling in 
People v. Narciso,
[11]
 
in which it was held that the qualifying circumstance
of use of superior strength can not be considered if the accused delivered
blows upon their victim âalternately and one after the other.â


This argument
has no merit.  The facts of the 
Narciso

case are completely different from those of the case at bar.  As the Solicitor General well points out, in

Narciso
, there was neither allegation nor proof of conspiracy among the
accused.  Neither was there proof that
they took advantage of their number to kill the accused.
[12]
 In contrast, the evidence in the
case at bar clearly shows that the accused acted in concert to kill the victim.  It is unnecessary
 
for the prosecution
to show the existence of previous agreement on the part of the accused to take
advantage of their numerical superiority to kill the victim.  Conspiracy does not require a previous plan
or agreement to commit assault. It is sufficient if, at the time of such
aggression, all the accused manifested by their acts a common intent or desire
to attack.
[13]


Even though the
accused in this case may have alternated in striking their victim, the
proximity in time of the individual blows they dealt on their victim as they
surrounded him so as to effectively block his escape and prevent him from
defending himself demonstrates the collective force they employed in order to
commit the crime.  The conspiracy to use
their superior strength resulting from their greater number is clearly shown
not only by the testimonies of the two prosecution eyewitnesses, but by the
number and nature of the stab wounds suffered by the victim as well.


Although we have
resolved to dismiss the appeal of Anacleto Novio, we have nonetheless reviewed
the evidence as to him. As already stated, Anacleto Novio claimed lack of
motive to kill Martiano Cinco.  But his
denial cannot prevail against the positive identification of the
accused-appellants by the two eyewitnesses.
[14]
 Moreover, his escape after his
conviction is an indication of his guilt.  As the proverb says, the guilty fleeth even when no man pursueth, but
the innocent are as bold as the lion.
[15]


The decision of
the trial court should be affirmed.  Given the time caused by this appeal, however, it is just and equitable
to raise the civil indemnity as awarded by the trial court in 1989 to that
currently prevailing as established by recent jurisprudence, which is 
P
50,000.00.
[16]


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the trial court is
AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the award of the civil indemnity to the
heirs of the victim is increased from 
P
30,000.00 pesos to 
P
50,000.00.


The trial court
is DIRECTED forthwith to order (1) the arrest of accused-appellant Anacleto âYontongâ
Novio and the forfeiture of his bail bond and (2) the commitment of
accused-appellant Eduardo Robedillo to the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa,
Metro Manila.
