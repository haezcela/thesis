DANTE J. PEREZ, PETITIONER,
VS. JUDGE GUILLERMO R. ANDAYA, RESPONDENT.

R E S O L U T I O N




ROMERO, J.:


For the Courtâs
resolution is a letter-complaint originally filed by Dante J. Perez on December
6, 1995, against respondent Judge Guillermo R. Andaya in connection with Civil
Case No. 91-126 (Community Development Corporation v. Asian Bank) for the allegedly
unreasonable delay in the disposition of the case.  CC No. 91-126, a complaint for the collection of a sum of money,
was filed on December 21, 1991, and was raffled to Branch 53 of the Regional
Trial Court of Lucena City (the Lucena RTC) presided by Judge Andaya.  By resolution dated March 20, 1996, Judge
Andaya was required to file his comment to the complaint. 


In his comment
dated May 9, 1996, Judge Andaya informed the court that he was deferring action
on two motions pending in his sala in view of the filing of the instant
administrative complaint.  He attributed
the delay in the proceedings to  the  heavy caseload which he was
handling as presiding judge of Branch 53 and 54 of the Lucena RTC.  In the meantime, with the inhibition of
Judge Andaya from hearing CC No. 91-126, said case was re-raffled to Judge
Mario Catelo of Branch 60 on June 26, 1996.  With this development, complainant Perez withdrew his complaint against
Judge Andaya.


After receiving
Judge Andayaâs comment, the Court, on November 18, 1996, resolved to refer the
case to Court of Appeals Justice Omar U. Amin for investigation, report and
recommendation.  On March 12, 1997,
Justice Amin submitted his report delineating his findings, and  recommending that Judge Andaya be
reprimanded for neglect of duty, 
viz
.:


âCivil Case No. 91-126 was filed on
November 21, 1991.  Respondent judge
admitted that several motions for extension to file answer or responsive
pleading were filed at the very instance of defendant Asian Bank Corp. which
ultimately culminated in defendantâs filing of a motion to dismiss on April 20,
1992.  A span of five (5) months had
lapsed from filing of the complaint.  Although opposition to motion to dismiss was filed by plaintiff Perez on
May 13, 1992(,) and the defendantâs reply thereafter, no resolution was ever
made to the motion to dismiss.


Respondent judge had to
unreasonably await action until December 7, 1995, or a span of four (4) years,
for plaintiffâs delayed reaction 
to file Motion to Admit Amended Complaint

which precipitated defendantâs filing of a new supplemental motion to dismiss
on February 16, 1996.  What was worse,
respondent judge withheld resolution through inaction on the two pending
pleadings due to (the) instant administrative complaint earlier filed against
him on December 6, 1995(,)  which,
according to his answer, âit (was) the better part of discretion to defer
action on the motions until such time plaintiff Perez may signify whether it
(sic) desires the undersigned to continue acting on the case and/or wait for
the advice of the Honorable Supreme Court on the matter.â  This is something deplorable.  Respondent judge is telling us that he has
ânever the intention to delay the proceedings in plaintiffâs caseâ but
precisely the subject matter of the complaint is the long delay for four (4)
years without even the availment of the benefit of a pre-trial hearing per the
vehement protestation of complainant Perez.


Members of the judiciary must
always strive to live up to their responsibility of assisting parties litigants
in obtaining just speedy and inexpensive determination of their cases and
proceedings as directed in Rule 1, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Court.  Judges should avoid delays or if it cannot
be totally avoided, at least to hold them to the minimum and repudiate dilatory
tactics.  Delay is always a recurring
complaint of litigants.  Precisely,
again, judges are reminded strict observance of the provisions prescribed by Article
VIII, Section 15, of the Constitution in matter(s) of adjudication and resolution
of cases submitted in relation to compliance of matters involving expeditious
disposition of cases to minimize delays in the processing of cases in the trial
courts.


Respondent judgeâs argument that on
September 29, 1993(,) he was designated acting presiding judge of (the)
RTC(,)  Branch 54(,)  in Lucena City and has been carrying (the)
heavy case load of two salas, and lately designated to hear heinous crimes(,)  should not be made as basis for excuses at
this point in time when the judiciary is under siege upon which the judge
should give complete and dedicated support of his primary and fundamental task
to restore full confidence of our people in the courts.


Premises considered, it is hereby recommended
that respondent judge, despite desistance of complainant to pursue his
administrative complaint, should be ordered 
reprimanded
 for neglect of
duty, with a warning that repetition of similar acts and other administrative
lapses will be dealt with more severely.â 


The Court sees
no plausible reason why this recommendation should not be honored.


ACCORDINGLY
, the Court Resolved to REPRIMAND
respondent Judge Guillermo R. Andaya for neglect of duty with the WARNING that
a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.
