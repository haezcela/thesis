THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 91483, February 27, 1998 ]


THE PEOPLE OF THE
PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. SAMUEL MAHUSAY Y FLORES AND
CRISTITUTO PASPOS @ âTOTOâ Y CATARIG, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


Appellants
Samuel Mahusay and Cristituto Paspos, were charged with the crime of robbery
with rape before the Regional Trial Court of Naval, Subprovince of Biliran,
Leyte. After trial on the merits, on November 7, 1989, the lower court declared
that appellantsâ guilt were proved beyond reasonable doubt.  From this conviction, appellants filed a
notice of appeal.


On November 18,
1987, we rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing,
the appeal is DISMISSED and the decision of the trial court finding appellants
Samuel Mahusay and Cristituto Paspos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of robbery with rape is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that
appellants shall each suffer three (3) terms of 
reclusion perpetua
.  In line with recent jurisprudence,
[1]
 appellants are ordered to
indemnify Maria Luisa Bughao in the amount of  
P
50,000.00 each as indemnity.  Costs against appellants.


SO ORDERED.â


On December 29,
1997, however, Action Officer Homobono R. Lachica Jr., addressed a letter to
this Court seeking clarification regarding the imposition of the penalty
therein insofar as Mahusay is concerned.


A perusal of the
records would show that on May 12, 1995, Mahusay filed an urgent motion to
withdraw his appeal which was accordingly granted by this Court in a resolution
dated July 17, 1995.  Consequently, an
entry of judgment was made on September 7, 1995 and the letter of transmittal
of such entry was sent on April 18, 1996.


ACCORDINGLY
, we resolved to MODIFY the
dispositive portion of the decision, 
viz
.:


âWHEREFORE,
in view of the foregoing, the appeal is DISMISSED and the decision of the trial
court finding appellant Cristituto Paspos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of robbery with rape is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that
appellant shall each suffer three (3) terms of 
reclusion perpetua
.  In line with recent jurisprudence,
[2]
 appellants is ordered to
indemnify Maria Luisa Bughao in the amount of  
P
50,000.00  as
indemnity.  Costs against appellants.


SO ORDERED.â
