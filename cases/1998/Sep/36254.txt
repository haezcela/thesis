[ G.R. No. 108725-26, September 25, 1998 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND FARMERS COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION (FACOMA), SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. EMILIO L. LEACHON, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE, RTC, BRANCH 46, 4TH JUDICIAL REGION, SAN JOSE, OCCIDENTAL MINDORO, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PURISIMA, J.:


The People of the Philippines,
represented by the Provincial Prosecutor of Occidental Mindoro, and the private
complainant, Farmersâ Cooperative Marketing Association (FACOMA), brought this
special civil action for 
certiorari
 and mandamus, to annul the orders,
dated January 18 and February 4, 1993, respectively, of Presiding Judge Emilio
L. Leachon, Jr. of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 46, San Jose, Occidental
Mindoro, who dismissed Criminal Case Nos. R-2877 and R-2828, and denied herein
petitionersâ motion for reconsideration.  Petitioners further pray that respondent Judge be ordered to proceed with
the trial of said cases.


The antecedent facts that matter
are, as follows:


On August 7, 1990, pursuant to the Resolution of the Municipal
Trial Court of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, the Provincial Prosecutor of
Occidental Mindoro filed two separate informations for violation of P. D. 772,
otherwise known as the Anti-Squatting Law, against Noli Hablo, Edmundo Mapindan
and Diego Escala, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. R-2877 and R-2828, before the
Regional Trial Court of Occidental Mindoro presided over by  respondent judge.


The cases proceeded to trial.  After presenting its evidence, the prosecution rested the cases, sending
in a written offer of evidence on November 14, 1991.


On August 18, 1992, almost a year after the prosecution had rested,
the respondent Judge  issued an Order
dismissing  the said cases 
motu
proprio
 on the ground of âlack of jurisdiction.â


From the aforesaid order of dismissal, petitioners appealed to this
Court via a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus, which was referred
to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition.


On December 24, 1992, the 12th
Division of the Court of Appeals came out with a decision reversing the
appealed Order of dismissal, ordering continuation of trial of subject criminal
cases, and disposing, thus:


âIN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING considerations, the petition
is given due course  and the orders  of respondent judge dated August 19, 1992
and September 1, 1992 are set aside and declared null and void. Respondent
judge is hereby directed to proceed with the hearing of the case, i.e., with
the presentation of evidence by the accused, then the rebuttal or surrebuttal
evidence, if necessary and thereafter, to decide the case on the basis of the
evidence adduced.  No pronouncement as
to costs.


SO ORDERED.â


On January 19, 1993, instead of
conducting the trial, as directed by the Court of Appeals, the respondent judge
dismissed the cases 
motu proprio, once more, 
opining
 
that P.D.
772 is rendered obsolete and deemed repealed by Sections 9 and 10, Article  XIII of the 1987 Constitution,  which provide that âurban or rural poor
dwellers shall not be evicted nor their dwellings demolished except in
accordance with law and in a just and humane manner.â


Petitionersâ Motion for
Reconsideration interposed on January 29, 1993, having been denied by the
respondent Judge on February 4, 1993,  petitioners found their way to this court via the instant petition.


The issue posited here is whether
or not the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing subject criminal cases for violation of
the Anti-Squatting Law, and in declaring the said law as repugnant to the
provisions of the 1987 Constitution.


To begin with, to every
legislative act attaches the presumption of constitutionality.  (Misolas vs.Panga, 181 SCRA 648; Alvarez vs.
Guingona, Jr., 252 SCRA 695).  Unless
otherwise repealed by a subsequent law or adjudged unconstitutional by this
Court, a law will always be presumed valid and the first and fundamental duty
of the court is to apply the law.  (Lim
vs. Pacquing, 240 SCRA 649; National Federation of Labor vs. Eisma, 127 SCRA
419)


Then, too, it is a basic rule of
statutory construction that repeals by implication are not favored unless it is
manifest that such is the legislative intent.  (Napocor vs. Province of Lanao del Sur, 264 SCRA 271) This doctrine is
premised on the rationale that the will of the legislature cannot be overturned
by the judicial function of construction and interpretation. (Ty vs. Trampe,
250 SCRA 500; Frivaldo vs. Comelec, 257 SCRA 727; Agujetas vs. Court of
Appeals, 261 SCRA 17)


Presidential Decree No. 772,
otherwise known as the Anti-Squatting Law, enjoys this presumption of
constitutionality.  At the time the
respondent Judge rendered the questioned Decision and issued the orders of
dismissal in 1993, Presidential Decree No. 772, Anti-Squatting Law, was still
effective.  Neither has this Court
declared its unconstitutionality, notwithstanding the social justice provision
of Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution, specifically on urban land reform and
housing.


Article XIII of the 1987
Constitution,  provides:


âSection 9. The State shall, by law, and for the common
good, undertake, in cooperation with the private sector, a continuing program
of urban land reform and housing which will make available at affordable cost
decent housing and basic services to underprivileged and homeless citizens in
urban centers and resettlement areas.  It shall also promote adequate employment opportunities to such
citizens.  In the implementation of such
program the State shall respect the rights of small property owners.â


âSec. 10. Urban or rural poor dwellers shall not be evicted
nor their dwellings demolished, except in accordance with law and in a just and
humane manner.


No resettlement of urban or rural dwellers shall be
undertaken without adequate consultation with them and the communities where
they are to be relocated."


Presidential Decree No. 772, on
the other hand, states:


âSec. 1. Any person, with the use of force, intimidation or
threat, or taking advantage of the absence or tolerance of the landowner,
succeeds in occupying or possessing the property of the latter against his will
for residential, commercial or any other purposes, shall be punished by
imprisonment ranging from six months to one year or a fine not less than  one thousand or more than  five thousand pesos at the discretion of the
Court, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.


If the offender is a corporation or association, the
maximum penalty of five years and the fine of thousand pesos shall be imposed
upon the president, director, manager or managing partners thereof.â


In dismissing subject criminal
cases for anti-squatting, respondent Judge ratiocinated that âif all the
accused in these cases were convicted and ordered evicted, it will run counter
to the said specific constitutional provisions because the conviction and
eviction will not be in a just and humane manner as the government has not yet
undertaken the resettlement of urban and rural dwellers (referring to all
accused in the cases at bar) and neither has the government consulted all the
accused as to where they should be relocated.â


From the aforequoted portion of the
questioned disposition below, it can be gleaned  that the reason of respondent Judge in dismissing subject cases
is that the eviction of the accused was not effected in a just and humane
manner as the government has not yet established a resettlement area for the
accused, and those who would be evicted have not been consulted as to the place
of their relocation.  The import of the
Order of dismissal under scrutiny is that- should the eviction be in a just and
humane manner, the same shall be valid and upheld.


The Court holds that the
respondent judge did not err in so construing the aforecited constitutional
provision.  Under the Constitution, what
makes the eviction and demolition of urban or rural poor dwellers illegal or
unlawful is when the same are not done in accordance with law and in a just and
humane manner.


However, respondent Judge erred in
predicating the validity or legality of eviction on the existence of a
resettlement plan and area.  The
constitutional requirement that the eviction and demolition be in accordance
with law and conducted in a just and humane manner does not mean that the
validity or legality of the demolition or eviction is hinged on the existence
of a resettlement area designated or earmarked by the government.  What is meant by âin accordance with lawâ
and âjust and humane mannerâ is that the person to be evicted be accorded due
process or an opportunity to controvert the allegation that his or her
occupation or possession of the property involved  is unlawful or against the will of the landowner; that should the
illegal or unlawful occupation be proven, the occupant be sufficiently notified
before actual eviction or demolition is done; and that there be no loss of
lives, physical injuries or unnecessary loss of or damage to properties.


Precisely, the enactment of an
anti-squatting law affords the alleged âsquattersâ the opportunity to present
their case before a competent court where their rights will be amply protected
and due process strictly observed.  By
filing the proper informations in court, complainants have complied with the
first requirement of due process, that is, the opportunity for the accused to
be heard and present evidence to show that his or her occupation or possession
of the property is not against the will or without the consent of the landowner
and is not tainted by the use of force, intimidation, threat or by the taking
advantage of the absence of or tolerance by the landowners.


Furthermore, what gives impetus to
P. D. 772 is the constitutional mandate that - âno person shall be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.â  Far from contravening,  P. D. 772 conforms with the 1987
Constitution,  in that it protects the
rights of a property owner against unlawful and illegal intrusion.


It should likewise be noted that a
constitutional question will not be decided unless it is properly raised in
appropriate cases (Tropical Homes Inc. vs. National Housing Authority, 142 SCRA
540).  Before the court can assume
jurisdiction over a constitutional question, the following requisites must
first be met:  (1) there must be an
actual case or controversy, including a conflict of rights susceptible of
judicial determination; (2) the constitutional question must be raised by a
proper party; (3) the constitutional question must be raised at the earliest
opportunity; and (4) the resolution of the constitutional question must be
necessary for  the resolution of the
case.  (Board of Optometry vs Colet, 260
SCRA 88)


In the case at bar, the respondent
Judge dismissed subject cases 
motu proprio
, after the prosecution had
rested the same and without giving the three accused an opportunity to present
their evidence.  What is more, there is
no showing that the issue of constitutionality of P. D. 772 was ever posed by
the accused.  Consequently, such an  issue cannot be given due course for the
simple reason that it was not raised by the proper party at the earliest
opportunity.


But the foregoing antecedent facts
and proceedings notwithstanding, the petition cannot now prosper because on
October 27, 1997, Republic Act No. 8368, entitled âAn Act Repealing
Presidential Decree No. 772 Entitled âPenalizing Squatting and Other Similar
Actsââ was enacted.  Section 3 of the
said Act provides that âall pending cases under the provisions of Presidential
Decree No. 772 shall be dismissed upon the effectivity of this Act.â


WHEREFORE, 
the Petition is hereby DISMISSED, without any
pronouncement as to costs.


SO ORDERED.
