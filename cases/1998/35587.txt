PANGANIBAN, J.:


Is an employee
entitled to back wages during the pendency of her appeal before the NLRC, even
if the assailed labor arbiterâs decision did not order her reinstatement?  May the NLRC decree back wages where the
employeeâs dismissal was legal?


The Case


The Court
answers this questions in the negative granting this petition for 
certiorari

under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the October 29, 1993 Resolution
[1]
 of the National Labor Relations
Commission
[2]
 (NLRC) which disposed as follows:
[3]


âWHEREFORE, the assailed
Decision is hereby set aside and a new one is entered dismissing the complaint
for lack of merit.


However, respondents
[petitioner herein] are ordered to pay complainant [private respondent herein]
her salaries from the date of the filing of the instant appeal on April 10,
1992 up to the date of the promulgation of this Resolution, pursuant to Art.
223 of the Labor Code, as amended.â


Petitioners also
challenge the NLRCâs Resolution dated February 7, 1994 which denied their
subsequent motion for reconsideration, for lack of merit.


The labor
arbiterâs decision, which the NLRC set aside, in NLRC NCR Case NO.
00-02-01060-91 dated  March 10, 1992
disposed as follows:
[4]


âWHEREFORE, based on the
foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the dismissal
of complainant improper and unjust.  Accordingly, respondent is hereby ordered to pay the complainant limited
backwages and other benefits for six (6) months in the amount of 
P
18,252.00.


Considering however the
physical condition of the complainant that was the real cause of her absences
and tardiness, it would be to their mutual advantage and most importantly to
the physical health welfare of complainant that was the real cause of her
absences and tardiness, it would be to their mutual advantage and most
importantly to the physical and health welfare of complainant that she is
separated from the service with separation benefits equivalent to Â½ month basic
salary for every year of service, a fraction of six months equivalent to one
year in the amount of 
P
22,815.00.


The charge of unfair labor
practice is hereby denied for lack of legal basis.


Individual respondent Celia
Buenconsejo is hereby absolved of any liability for she acted only in her
official capacity.


Other claims
are denied for lack of merit.â


The Facts


Labor
Arbiter  Daniel C. Cueto recited the
facts of this  case as follow:
[5]


âComplainant is a sewer who
started working with respondent in November 1975.  She was dismissed for abandonment on February 11, 1991.  At the time of her dismissal, she was
receiving a salary of 
P
117.00 per day of work.  She claimed that while it is true that she was absent from
November 30, 1990 up to December 11, 1990, her dismissal on ground of
abandonment is not consonance with law considering that her absences was [sic]
attributable to chronic ashmatic [sic] bronchitis which she contacted since
early 1990 yet.  She presented as  evidence the medical certificate dated March
4, 1991 attesting for [sic] her medical treatment covering the period January
1990 to May 28, 1990.  She claims that
her failure to report for work for 11 days was due to sickness wherein
respondents were notified by her through the telephone.  Complainant argued that she did not abandon
her job and that is evidenced by her immediate filing of instant complaint on
February 8, 1991.  Her 16 years of
service, according to complainant, should have been considered by respondents
before she was dismissed.  She prays for
reinstatement plus backwages and also for damages.


Respondents contended
otherwise.  It is their position that
complainant was hired on February 5, 1978 and that since the early period of
her employment she committed various violations of company rules and regulations
ranging from habitual tardiness to frequent absences.  Said misdemeanor registered the highest number of tardiness in
the second quarter of 1984 numbering 45 times from 37 times in the first
quarter of 1984 whereas in terms of monthly tardiness, complainant incurred 21
times in March and June, both in 1990 the said tardiness covered by
corresponding memoranda marked as Annexes âAâ to âLâ for respondents, that
despite the several warnings given, complainant persisted in her tardiness and
frequent absences.  By way of evidence,
respondent submitted the memorandum (Annex O) giving complainant the stern
warning for frequent absenteeism incurred in 1988 numbering 49 absences that
affects her performance where the same became worse when she absented for ten
(10) days in August 1989, which was subject of another memorandum warning that
management shall be constrained to take the necessary  drastic action against her due to loss of productive manhours
caused by complainantâs excessive absences.  Finally, due to complaintâs absences from November 30, 1990 to December
11, 1990 the respondent issued another letter dated December 11, 1990 to
complainant (Annex âRâ respondent position paper) requiring her to explain in
writing 72 hours why you should not be considered dismisses for having
abandoned your job considering that you have been earlier served warning memos
for the similar violations.â  Respondents stated that despite the said order, it was only on December
19, 1990 that complaint went to the office of respondent to explain.  Respondents were forced to terminate
complaintâs employment due to her failure to report for work and explain her
absence for the straight 20 days without any leave or permission for which
reason they considered her continued absence as an abandonment of work.â


Declaring âthe
dismissal of complainant improper and unjust,â the labor arbiter  awarded her âlimited backwages and other
benefitsâ plus separation pay equivalent to one half month for every year of
service.  The labor arbiter did not
order her reinstatement, holding that her separation from employment would be
to the partiesâ âmutual benefit and most importantly to the physical and health
welfare of complainant.â


Respondent NLRCâs Ruling


On appeal,
Respondent NLRC ruled that the dismissal of private respondent was justified.  It held, however, that Article 223 of the
Labor Code required the reinstatement of private respondent during the pendency
of her appeal.  Thus, it awarded back
wages for the said period when the appeal was pending before it, reasoning as
follows:
[6]


âVerily,
respondents-appellants could no longer be faulted when they decided to
terminate the services of complainant for her failure to improve her attendance
despite repeated warnings.


However, pursuant to Art.
223 of the Labor Code, as amended, which provides for mandatory reinstatement
whether actual or on payroll, pending appeal, respondent should pay complainant
her salaries from the time the appeal was filed on April 10, 1992 up to the
date of the promulgation of this Resolution.â


Dissatisfied,
petitioners lodged this recourse before this Court.  In the Resolution
[7]
 dated June 29, 1994, this Court
issued a temporary restraining order thus:
[8]


âNOW, THEREFORE, you
(respondents), your officers, agents, representatives, and/or persons acting
upon your orders or in your place or stead, are hereby ENJOYED from enforcing
or executing the resolutions of public respondent National Labor Relations
Commission dated October29, 1993 and February 8, 1994, and in any manner or
purpose continuing with the proceedings of the case in NLRC NCR Case No.
00-02-01060-91 entitled âNational Federation of Labor Unions (NAFLU) and Salud
Galing vs. Filflex Industrial and Manufacturing Corporation and/or Celia
Buenconsejo of the Department of Labor and Employment.â
[9]


The Issue


Petitioners raise
a single issue:
[10]


âx x x.  Petitioners submit that the only issue is
whether the public respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion,
amounting to lack of jurisdiction, in awarding private respondent Galing her
salaries from the date of the filing of the appeal on April 10, 1992 up to the
date of the promulgation of its Resolution on October 29, 1993, given the
undisputed fact of her persistent, repeated, prolonged and contumacious
violations of company rules and regulations.â


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
meritorious.


Sole Issue:  
Back
wages During Pendency of Appeal


Petitioners
argue that the âsecond paragraph of the dispositive portion of the Decision
[11]
 has no basis in fact or in
law.â  They assert that âthe decision of
Labor Arbiter Cuerto did not call for the reinstatement of [C]omplainant Galing
[private respondent herein], [thus] it follows that there is no basis now of
this Honorable Commission to Grant her backwages during the period of
appeal.  Clearly, Article 223 finds no
application to the instant case.â
[12]
 They also contend that the assailed
Resolution âbecame inconsistent with itself.  For while it delared the dismissal of the complainant legal, it ruled
nevertheless that [C]omplainant Galing should have been reinstated during the period
of the appeal.â
[13]


Agreeing with
the petition, the solicitor general clarifies that Article 223 of the Labor
Code is inapplicable to the instant case because Labor Arbiter Cuerto âdid not
order the reinstatement of private respondent.â  Likewise, the government lawyer agrees that the NLRC Resolution
was inherently inconsistent for holding that the dismissal of Complainant
Galing was justified and, at the same time, ruling that she should have been
reinstated during the pendency of the appeal.
[14]


On the other
hand, the legal department of the NLRC
[15]
 maintains that âreinstatement
(pending appeal) whether actual or in payroll is mandatory under Art. 223 of
the Codeâ
[16]


Private
respondent adds that under paragraph one, second sentence of the Labor
Arbiterâs decision, âthere [was] a call for reinstatement of the complainant
because of the backwages granted to her.â
[17]


We agree with
the petitioners and the solicitor  general.


No Order of Reinstatement


The relevant law
is Article 223
[18]
 of the Labor Code, which reads:


âART. 223.  Appeal. â Decision, awards, or orders of the
Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any
or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions,
awards, or orders.  Such appeal may be
entertained only on any of the following grounds:


x x x
                                             
x x
x
                                     
x x
x


In any event, the
decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated  employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect
is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal.  The employee shall either be admitted back
to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to her dismissal
or separation or, at the option of the employer, merely reinstated in the
payroll.  The posting of a bond by  the employer shall not stay the execution
for reinstatement provided herein
.

xâ (Underscoring supplied.)


In other words,
reinstatement during appeal is warranted only when the labor arbiter (LA)
himself rules that the dismissed employee should be reinstated.  In the present case, neither the dispositive
portion nor the text of the labor arbiterâs decision ordered the reinstatement
of private respondent.  Further, the
back wages granted to private respondent were specifically limited to the
period prior to the filing of the appeal with Respondent NLRC.  In fact, the LAâs decision ordered her
separation from service for the partiesâ âmutual advantage and most importantly
to physical and health welfare of the complainant.â  Hence, it is an error and an abuse of discretion for the NLRC to
hold that the award of limited back wages, by implication, included an order
for private respondentâs reinstatement.


An order for
reinstatement must be specifically declared and cannot be presumed; like back
wages, it is a separate and distinct relief given to an illegally dismissed
employee.
[19]
 There being no specific order for
reinstatement and the order being for complainantâs separation, there can be no
basis for the award of salaries/back wages during the pendency of appeal.


NLRC Found
Dismissal Justified


In  addition to the foregoing discussion, there
is an equally cogent reason to sustain the petition.  Before reinstatement or back wages may be granted, there must be
unjust or illegal dismissal from work.
[20]
 The labor arbiter ruled that
private respondentâs âabsences and tardiness by itself are sufficient ground
for the complainantâs dismissal were it not for reason of sickness which we
believe is excusable.â
[21]
 On appeal, however, the NLRC
categorically declared that private respondentâs dismissal was wholly justified
because her performance was characterized by inefficiency, infractions and
absenteeism.
[22]
 Indeed, the records substantiate
the following finding of the NLRC:


âIt was sufficiently
established that complainantâs absences from November 11, 1990 until December
18, 1990 are unauthorized.  She never
informed the respondent of her whereabouts which naturally worked to the prejudice
to her work.  Complainantâs assertion
that she called-up the respondent by telephone, informing them of state of
illness is a bare allegation, unsupported by convincing evidence.  This [sic] unauthorized absences left no
alternative to the respondent but to seek her explanation on the matter (
Rollo

p. 48).  Complainant, however, did not
bother to explain within a reasonable period of time and she only showed-up in
the respondentâs office on December 19, 1990.

In this particular,
complainantâs attitude toward her work is characterized by infractions and
inefficiency.  It is undisputed that
besides her unauthorized absences from November 11, 1990 to December 18, 1990,
she previously incurred various offenses.  She was frequently late in reporting for work during the following

Evidence
likewise disclosed that complainant was absent for 10 days during the month of
August 1989 and incurred absences without leave on October 6 and 7, 1989, (
Rollo
,
p. 46 to 47).  The foregoing infractions
show the unsatisfactory work performance of complainant.  In the case of Mendoza 
vs
. NLRC, 196 SCRA
606, the Supreme Court held that âthe totality of the infractions that
petitioner had committed justifies the penalty of dismissal.â  Furthermore, complainant was duly informed
of the company rules on absences to the fact that a 7
th
 absence within a calendar
year constitute habitual unexcused absence. (
Rollo
, p. 44).  Instead however of improving her attendance,
complainant continuously ignored the warnings given her by the respondent.  This finds support in the findings of the Labor
Arbiter when [sic] ruled that:


âx x x All that we can see
from the parties pleadings is the fact that complainant have (sic) been
incurring tardiness and absences and that despite numerous warnings sent to her
in fact numbering 16 all in all from 1989 to 1990, she still persist in
incurring absences and tardiness.  She
had not shown enough improvement on her attendance that last of which was her
absences incurred from November 30, 1990 to December 19, 1990 without any
justification presented relative to the said absences except the reliance to
the certification of her attending physician which was dated March 4, 1991 that
she was under treatment of the said doctor from âchronic ashtmatic[sic]
bronchitisâ, covering the period of January 19, 1990 to May 28, 1990.  While it may be true that complainant was
suffering from the alleged sickness, her absences incurred during the period
November 30, 1990 up to the time when she reported to explain on December 19,
1990 was not supported by competent proof to rely on.â


Since the
dismissal of private respondent was deemed valid, she cannot be entitled to
reinstatement and back wages.
[23]
 An award of back wages by the NLRC
during the period of appeal is totally inconsistent with its finding of a valid
dismissal.


Additionally,
private respondent cannot now be granted separation pay or any other
affirmative relief previously awarded to her by the labor arbiter but reversed
by the NLRC.  Since she did not appeal
from the NLRCâs Resolution, she is presumed to be satisfied with the
adjudication therein.  This is in accord
with the doctrine that a party who has not appealed cannot obtain from the
appellate court any affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the
appealed decision.
[24]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby
GRANTED.  The award of back wages in the
assailed NLRC Resolution dated October 29, 1993 is DELETED.  The temporary restraining order issued on
June 29, 1994 is MADE PERMANENT.  No
costs.
