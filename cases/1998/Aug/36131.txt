D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:



This is a petition seeking review of the decision of the Court of 
Appeals, dated March 15, 1991, which dismissed the petition for 
certiorari filed by herein petitioner and affirmed the order of the 
National Electrification Administration (NEA), dated October 1, 1990, 
declaring private respondent Miguel Cotiamco a bonafide member of the 
Leyte IV Electric Cooperative (LEYECO IV) and therefore qualified to be a
 director of said cooperative.


The facts are as follows:


Petitioner Elmer Espina and private respondent Miguel Cotiamco were 
candidates for director of respondent Leyte IV Electric Cooperative 
(LEYECO IV), representing the Baybay South District.
[1]



On May 23, 1990, petitioner Elmer Espina filed with the LEYECO IV 
District Election Committee (DECOM) a petition to disqualify private 
respondent Miguel Cotiamco on the ground that respondent was not a 
bonafide member of the LEYECO IV.
[2]
  The DECOM endorsed the petition to the National
 Electrification Administration on May 26, 1990.
[3]



On May 27, 1990, the election for the position of director of the LEYECO
 IV, Baybay South District was held. The results of the election showed 
that Cotiamco garnered 636 votes against Espinaâs 599 votes. 
Accordingly, private respondent Cotiamco was proclaimed winner by the 
DECOM and sworn in as member of the board on June 6, 1990.
[4]



On June 27, 1990, the NEA remanded the petition for disqualification 
filed by petitioner Espina to the DECOM for proper disposition on the 
ground that the latter had original jurisdiction over the case.
[5]



After hearing, the DECOM rendered a decision on July 28, 1990 
disqualifying private respondent Cotiamco.
[6]
  Consequently, petitioner Espina took his 
oath and assumed office.
[7]



However, private respondent Cotiamco appealed to the NEA which on 
October 1, 1990 reversed the DECOM and declared private respondent duly 
elected director of LEYECO IV, Baybay South District.
[8]
  The NEA found that, 
contrary to petitionerâs claim, private respondent Miguel Cotiamco was a
 bonafide member of the LEYECO IV.
[9]



On October 23, 1990, petitioner Espina in turn filed with the Court of 
Appeals a petition for certiorari and prohibition with an urgent prayer 
for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and a writ of 
preliminary and permanent injunction.
[10]



Private respondent Cotiamco moved to dismiss the petition on the ground 
of lack of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, failure of petitioner 
to exhaust administrative remedies, and lack of merit of the 
petition.
[11]



In a decision rendered on March 15, 1991, the Court of Appeals upheld 
the order of the NEA.
[12]

  It held that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was
 inapplicable to the case at bar; that the NEA did not commit grave 
abuse of discretion; that the order of the NEA dated October 1, 1990 was
 issued in the exercise of its power of supervision and control over 
electric cooperatives; and, that the findings of the NEA were supported 
by substantial evidence.
[13]



Hence, this petition. Petitioner contends:
[14]





    I.
  



    RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS AND NEA ERRED IN HOLDING AND FINDING 
THAT MIGUEL COTIAMCO IS A MEMBER OF THE COOPERATIVE AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR 
CANDIDATE [sic] TO THE POSITION OF MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, 
LEYECO IV.
  



    II.
  


 RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING AND FINDING 
THAT 
RESPONDENT NEAâS LETTER-ORDER (ANNEX âGâ) WAS ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
LAW, RULES AND REGULATIONS. IN FACT, THE SAID LETTER-ORDER WAS ISSUED IN
 GROSS VIOLATION OF PETITIONERâS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. 





Respondents justify the decision of the NEA to take cognizance of the 
case and dispose of it as a valid exercise of its appellate jurisdiction
 and power of supervision and control over electric cooperatives. 
Moreover, they contend that the present petition for review should be 
dismissed for failure of petitioner Espina to exhaust administrative 
remedies.


The present petition is well taken. Private respondentsâ contentions 
have no merit.


The rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not absolute but 
admits of exceptions. One of these exceptions is when only a question of
 law is involved and nothing of an administrative nature is to be done 
or can be done.
[15]
  In this 
case, the issue whether private respondent Cotiamco is a member of the 
cooperative is one which calls for the interpretation and application of
 both the law creating the NEA and the by-laws of the LEYECO IV. 
Consequently, the Court of Appeals correctly assumed jurisdiction over 
the case.


However, we hold that the appellate court erred in upholding the NEAâs 
decision and ruling that the said agency did not commit grave abuse of 
discretion in declaring private respondent Cotiamco a bonafide member of
 the LEYECO IV and therefore qualified to run for a seat in the board of
 directors on the basis of the following facts:
[16]





    a)  That membership No. 166 had long been approved by the LEYECO IV 
Board of Directors on October 30, 1977;
  


 b)  That the LEYECO IV Consumerâs Index bears the entry 
Carmen-Miguel Cotiamco using the same membership number; 



    c)  That Miguel Cotiamco had been using the aforementioned 
membership number in all his dealings/transactions with the electric 
cooperative;
  


 d)  That the LEYECO IV Board and Management allowed him to 
use the
 same membership number when he availed of separate metering on November
 16, 1987 per Meter No. 65026129 and which fact can be gleaned from the 
entries of the Consumerâs Index thereafter separately issued in his 
favor; 


 e)  That it was he who used the said membership number and 
not 
Carmen Cotiamco in the District Elections for Baybay South District in 
1987 per ballot No. 000219 - entry No. 951 of the Votersâ Masterlist; 




    f)   That his name as bonafide member of the electric cooperative 
appeared in both the 1987 and 1990 Masterlist of Voters for Baybay South
 District.
  





and on the principle of estoppel:
[17]




 Furthermore, the principle of estoppel now lies as against 
the 
LEYECO IV Board and Management with respect to the issue of his [Miguel 
Cotiamcoâs] membership with the electric cooperative. 





Section 21 of P.D. No. 269 (Charter of the NEA) provides:




    SEC. 21. 
Members.
 - Each incorporator of a 
cooperative 
shall be a member thereof, but no other person may become a member 
thereof unless such other person agrees to use services furnished by the
 cooperative when made available by it. Membership in a cooperative 
shall not be transferable, except as provided in the by-laws. The 
by-laws may prescribe additional qualifications and limitations with 
respect to membership. (underlining ours)
  





Thus, the law clearly requires that for a person other than an 
incorporator to be a member of the cooperative, he must agree to use the
 services furnished by the cooperative and he must have such other 
qualifications as may be prescribed by the by-laws of the cooperative. 
In this case, the by-laws of the LEYECO IV requires not only that one 
agrees to purchase electric energy but that one must apply for 
membership in the cooperative. Thus, the by-laws states:
[18]




 SECTION 1. Requirements for membership. Any person, firm, 
association, corporation or body politic or subdivision thereof will 
become member of LEYTE IV ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC. hereinafter called 
the âCooperativeâ), provided that he or it has first: 





        (a)     Made a written application for membership therein;
    



        (b)     Agreed to purchase from the Cooperative electric energy 
as hereinafter specified;
    



        (c)     Agreed to comply with and be bound by the articles of 
incorporation and by laws of the Cooperative and any rules and 
regulations adopted by the board; and
    



        (d)     Paid the Membership fee hereinafter specified.
    





    Provided, however, that no person, firm, corporation or body politic
 shall became a member unless and until he or it has been accepted for 
membership by the board.
  



    No membership in the Cooperative shall be transferable, except as 
provided in these bylaws.
  


 The word âboardâ is used herein to refer to the board of 
directors. 



    SECTION 2.        Membership Certificates. Membership in the 
Cooperative shall be evidenced by a membership certificate which shall 
be in such form and shall contain such provisions as shall be determined
 by the board. Such certificate shall be signed by the President and by 
the Secretary of the Cooperative and the corporate seal shall be affixed
 thereto. No membership certificate shall be issued for less than the 
membership fee fixed in these bylaws, nor until such membership fee has 
been fully paid for. In case a certificate is lost, destroyed or 
mutilated a new certificate may be issued therefor upon such uniform 
terms and indemnity to the Cooperative as the board may prescribe.
  





Private respondent Cotiamco did not meet these requirements. In fact, he
 has no certificate to show as evidence of membership in the 
cooperative. The fact that he purchased electric energy using Membership
 Certificate No. 166 does not prove he is a member of the cooperative. 
The membership certificate in question is not his but that of his 
sister-in-law Carmen Cotiamco. The Manager of the Member Service 
Department of LEYECO IV certified that Miguel Cotiamco is not a member 
of the cooperative. His certification states:
[19]





    LEYTE IV ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC.
  



    Hilongos, Leyte
  



    C E R T I F I C A T I O N 
  



  TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
  





This is to certify that one Miguel Cotiamco of 30 de Deciembre St., 
Baybay, Leyte is an âindustrial consumer of the Cooperative as of 
November 11, 1987.


It is certified further that nothing on record showed the membership of 
Miguel Cotiamco to (sic) the Cooperative.




    Issued this 3rd day of July, 1990 at Hilongos, Leyte.
  



    (SGD.) ROMULO L. LACERNA
  



    Manager, Member Services Dept.
  





(underlining ours)


On the other hand, said manager certified that the registered member is 
actually Carmen Cotiamco, Miguelâs sister-in-law, thus:
[20]





    LEYTE IV ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC.
  



    Hilongos, Leyte
  



    C E R T I F I C A T I O N 
  



    TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
  





THIS IS TO CERTIFY that Mrs. Carmen Cotiamco is the registered member of
 Leyeco IV under membership #166 which was approved by the Board of 
Directors on October 30, 1997.


Evidencing her membership is the issuance of Official Receipt No. 000287
 issued on October 24, 1997.


Hilongos, Leyte, May 23, 1990.




    (SGD.) ROMULO LACERNA
  



    Manager, Member Services Department
  


(underlining ours)
  





He also certified that there is nothing on record which showed a 
separate membership of private respondent Miguel Cotiamco, thus:
[21]





    C E R T I F I C A T I O N 
  



    TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: 
  





THIS IS TO CERTIFY that records of this office show that CARMEN-MIGUEL 
COTIAMCO is a member-consumer bearing membership number 166 since August
 18, 1981.


It is further certified that Miguel Cotiamco become an industrial 
consumer since November 16, 1987 using the same membership number.


Nothing on record showed a separate membership of Miguel Cotiamco.


Issued this 6th day of June, 1990 at Hilongos, Leyte.




    (SGD.) ROMULO L. LACERNA
  



    Manager, Member Services Department
  





Nor can there be a joint membership of private respondent Miguel 
Cotiamco and his sister-in-law Carmen, as the by-laws allow joint 
membership only in the case of husband and wife. Thus, the by-laws 
provides in Article I, Â§Â§3&4 that:



 Section 3. Joint Membership. A husband and wife may apply 
for a 
joint membership and, subject to their compliance with the requirements 
set forth in Section 1 of this Article, may be accepted for such 
membership. The term âmemberâ as used in these bylaws shall be deemed to
 include a husband and wife holding a joint membership and any 
provisions relating to the rights and liabilities of membership shall 
apply equally with respect to the holders of a joint membership. Without
 limiting the generality of the foregoing, the effect of the hereinafter
 specified actions by or in respect of the holders of a joint membership
 shall be as follows: 



  (a)     The presence at a meeting of either or both shall be regarded 
as the presence of one member and shall constitute a joint waiver of 
notice of the meeting;
  



  (b)     The vote of either separately or both jointly shall constitute
 one joint vote;
  



  (c)     A waiver of notice signed by either or both shall constitute a
 joint waiver;
  



  (d)     Notice to either shall constitute notice to both;
  



  (e)     Expulsion of either shall terminate the joint membership;
  



  (f)      Withdrawal of either terminate the joint membership;
  



  (g)     Either but not both may be elected or appointed as an officer 
or board member, provided that both meet the qualifications for such 
office.
  



  SECTION 4. Conversion of Membership. (a) A Membership may be converted
 to a joint membership upon the written request of the holder thereof 
and the agreement by such holder and his or her spouse to comply with 
the articles of incorporation, by-laws and rules and regulations adopted
 by the board. The outstanding membership certificates shall be 
surrendered, and shall be reissued by the Cooperative in such manner as 
shall indicate the changed membership status.
  



  (b) Upon the death of either spouse who is a party to the joint 
membership, such membership shall be held solely by the survivor. The 
outstanding membership certificate shall be surrendered, and shall be 
reissued in such manner as shall indicate the changed membership status,
 provided, however, that the estate of the deceased shall not be 
released from any debts due to the Cooperative.
  





Nevertheless, the NEA and the Court of Appeals held that having allowed 
private respondent Cotiamco to exercise the membership rights of Carmen 
Cotiamco to vote in the district elections of 1987 and 1990, the 
cooperative could no longer deny his membership under the principle of 
estoppel. But, as petitioner points out, he was not privy to any 
arrangement that private respondent and the LEYECO IV might have and 
thus the doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked against himself. It may 
be added that the doctrine cannot be used to disregard the provisions of
 law, in this case, the provision of P.D. No. 269, Â§24 which requires 
membership in the cooperative as a condition for membership in the board
 of directors. It states:




    Sec. 24. 
Board of Directors
.- (a) The business 
of a 
cooperative shall be managed by a board of not less than five directors,
 each of whom shall be a member of the cooperative or of another which 
is a member thereof. . . . 
  





The ruling of the NEA that private respondent is a bonafide member of 
the cooperative and for that reason was qualified to be a director 
contravenes both the provisions of P.D. No. 269 and the by-laws of the 
LEYECO IV. It was error for the Court of Appeals to affirm such ruling 
of the NEA which was clearly rendered with grave abuse of discretion.


Petitionerâs contention that he was denied due process is, however, 
untenable. As the NEA and the Court of Appeals found, petitioner filed 
an opposition to private respondent Cotiamcoâs âMotion for Issuance of 
Restraining Order Against Espinaâ in the NEA, thus belying petitionerâs 
claim that he did not know that the decision of the DECOM had been 
appealed to the NEA. Consequently, he cannot claim lack of notice. It is
 settled that what the law prohibits is not the absence of previous 
notice but the absolute absence thereof and lack of an opportunity to be
 heard.
[22]



Under Â§48(17) of the LEYECO IV Election Code, votes cast for a 
âcandidate who has been disqualifiedâ are considered stray votes. 
Although at the time the election in this case was held private 
respondent had not been declared to be disqualified, there is no reason 
why this provision cannot be applied to this case and the votes cast for
 him considered stray so as to declare petitioner the winner. After all,
 the petition for disqualification of private respondent was filed 
before the election.


At all events, this case is now moot and academic as the term of office 
of director expired on June 26, 1993, pursuant to Art. IV, Â§2 of the 
by-laws of LEYECO IV.



WHEREFORE,
 petition is DISMISSED for being 
moot and academic.


SO ORDERED.
