EMPIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND MONERA ANDAL, RESPONDENTS.

PURISIMA, J.:



This is a Petition of a surety company disowning solidary liability with
 its principal, a recruitment agency, on the monetary claims of an 
overseas contract worker for illegal dismissal, non-payment and 
underpayment of salaries.


The antecedent facts and proceedings can be capsulized, as follows:


Private respondent Monera Andal applied with G & M Phils., Inc. 
for 
an overseas employment as a domestic helper in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia. She was hired for a term of two years at a monthly basic salary 
of US $200.00.


She left for the said jobsite on May 17, 1991 and worked for a certain 
Abdullah Al Basha. But on January 11, 1992, she was repatriated. Upon 
her repatriation, she lost no time in bringing her complaint before the 
Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) for illegal dismissal, 
non-payment and underpayment of salaries. Impleaded as a co-respondent 
in the complaint was the herein petitioner, Empire Insurance Company, in
 its capacity as the surety of G & M Phils.


Subject complaint averred, inter alia, that:



 â...she was not paid for four months and underpaid for four 
months; that she was forced to preterminate her contract due to 
unbearable treatment in the hands of her employer and the non-payment 
and underpayment of her salaries; and that she was constructively 
dismissed from employment. In her affidavit, she alleged that she was 
unpaid for 3 1/2 months; that for four months she was paid only US 
$150.00 instead of the agreed rate of US $200.00; that her employer 
resented her effort to collect her delayed salaries and, in retaliation,
 made her work long hours, allowing her to sleep only five hours daily 
and requiring her to render services for his relatives and friends 
without giving her additional compensation; that after serving her 
employer for 7 1/2 months, she sought the help of the Philippine 
Embassy; that her employer terminated her employment due to her 
insistent demand for the payment of her claims; and that she was 
repatriated at her own expense. On May 14, 1992, she testified that the 
wife of her employer always beat her and that her employer gave her US 
$450.00 representing her salaries for three (3) months. In her position 
paper, she reiterated the sufferings she allegedly underwent in the 
course of her employment and alleged, further, that the efforts of the 
Philippine Embassy to mediate and/or to settle her claims failed; that 
her services were abruptly terminated by her employer; and she was 
forced to depart at her own expense (arriving in the Philippines with 
only whatever clothing she had on).â (pp.2-4, NLRC decision dated 
November 22, 1994) 





Empire Insurance Company, now the petitioner, theorized that the 
complainant, Monera Andal, was without any cause of action against it 
for the alleged reason that the liability of its principal and 
co-respondent had not been established. It further argued that its 
liability, if any, for the money claims sued upon was merely subsidiary.


In its answer to the complaint, respondent G & M (Phil.), Inc., 
stated that it had no knowledge of complainantâs unpaid and underpaid 
salaries, her working conditions and of the proceedings at the 
Philippine Embassy. It denied the charge of illegal dismissal, reasoning
 out that the complainant abandoned her job. In its position paper, it 
contended that the complainantâs money claims in dispute are not 
meritorious as the same are not supported by substantial evidence. It 
also capitalized on what it branded as the inconsistencies in the 
complainantâs pleadings with her admission that the Philippine Embassy 
mediated her claims, which development could have meant that subject 
claims had been settled.


On July 13, 1993, POEA Administrator Felicisimo O. Joson decided the 
claims in question; disposing, as follows:



 âWHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing premises, 
respondents are hereby ordered to pay complainant the following: 



 1. US $200.00 or its peso equivalent representing 
complainantâs 
salary differentials for four (4) months for the period May 17, 1991 to 
September 17, 1991 computed at US $50.00 a month; 



    2. US $3,300.00 or its peso equivalent representing the payment of 
salaries for 16.5 months as the unexpired portion of the contract.
  


 SO ORDERED.â
  





From the aforesaid decision adverse to it, petitioner Empire Insurance 
Company appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission; posing as 
issues, that:



 1. Complainant (Monera Andal) had no cause of action against
 
petitioner because the liability of petitionerâs principal and 
co-respondent (G&M) had not been established. 


 2. Petitionerâs liability, if any, was merely subsidiary. 






On November 22, 1994, the NLRC came out with a judgment of affirmance, 
upholding the POEA, and holding, thus:



 âThe argument that respondent Empire Insurance Company is 
only 
subsidiarily liable for the judgment award is unmeritorious. It is 
settled that a surety is considered in law as being the same party as 
the debtor in relation to whatever is adjudged touching the obligation 
of the latter, and their liabilities are interwoven as to be 
inseparable... 



    WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED.
  


 SO ORDERED.â
  





Undaunted by the denial of its motion for reconsideration, petitioner 
found its way to this court via the present petition, raising the 
pivotal issue of whether or not respondent NLRC erred in adjudging it 
(petitioner) jointly liable with its principal, G & M Phils., 
Inc., 
for the payment of private respondentâs monetary claims.


Petitioner faults respondent NLRC for holding that G & M Phils.,
 
Inc. failed to comply with the rules and regulations of the Department 
of Labor and Employment. It is petitionerâs submission that there is no 
basis for holding it liable as surety under the premises.


Although it concedes that the burden of proof in cases of illegal 
dismissal rests on the employer, petitioner argues that when private 
respondent Monera Andal asked the Philippine Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia to mediate her claims with her employer, such a move on the part 
of private respondent shifted the 
onus probandi
 to 
her to substantiate her claim.


Private respondentâs Comment sought the dismissal of the petition for 
being a wrong mode of appeal from the NLRC decision. It is private 
respondentâs stance that appeal from decisions of the National Labor 
Relations Commission to the Supreme Court is by a special civil action 
for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules 
of Court. Not a petition for review under Rule 45.


The Solicitor General, as counsel for respondent NLRC, joined private 
respondent in stressing on such procedural defect. Furthermore, the 
Solicitor General pointed out that the errors assigned by petitioner 
deal primarily with factual findings and, as such, are unavailing under 
the well-entrenched rule that findings of fact by administrative 
agencies and quasi-judicial bodies are generally accorded not only 
respect but finality, and are not to be disturbed on appeal.


We find for respondents.


Before delving into the merits of the petition, the procedural objection
 of respondents should first be resolved. Private respondent and the 
Solicitor General have correctly pointed out the elementary rule of 
procedure with regard to review of decisions rendered by the National 
Labor Relations Commission. The only way a labor case may reach the 
Supreme Court is through a petition for 
certiorari
 
under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court.
[1]
  A petition for 

certiorari
 which is a special civil action under 
Rule 65 should be distinguished from a petition for review on 

certiorari

 which is a mode of appeal under Rule 45. Under Rule 65, only questions 
of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess
 of jurisdiction may be entertained by the reviewing court. Therefore, 
only decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission tainted with 
grave abuse of discretion or jurisdictional errors may be elevated to 
this court.


Findings and/or conclusions of fact cannot be assailed in a petition for
 
certiorari
.
[2]

  The inquiry in such a petition is limited exclusively to the issue of 
whether or not the respondent official acted without or in excess of 
jurisdiction. Consequently, petitioner cannot assail the finding arrived
 at by public respondent NLRC that the employer involved violated 
pertinent POEA rules and regulations.


However, while an appeal to the Supreme Court from decisions of the 
National Labor Relations Commission should be pursued as a special civil
 action for 
certiorari
, in a number of cases this 
court has 
treated as special civil actions for certiorari petitions erroneously 
captioned as petitions for review on certiorari âin the interest of 
justice.â
[3]



In the case of Peopleâs Security, Inc. vs. NLRC,
[4]
  this Court held that:



 âDismissal of appeal purely on technical grounds is frowned 
upon 
where the policy of the courts is to encourage hearings of appeal on 
their merits. The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very 
rigid technical sense, rules of procedure are used only to help secure, 
not override substantial justice. If a technical and rigid enforcement 
of the rules is made, their aim would be defeated.â (Tamayo v. Court of 
Appeals, 209 SCRA 518, 522 
[1992]
  citing Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, 72 SCRA
 120 
[1976]
  ). 
Consequently, in the interest of justice, the instant petition for 
review shall be treated as a special civil action on 

certiorari
.â
  





The single issue posed for resolution by this court here is - whether or
 not the petitioning surety company is jointly liable with its 
principal, G & M Phils, Inc., a recruitment agency, for the 
payment 
of respondent employeeâs monetary claims in litigation.


We rule in the affirmative. Petitioner is solidarily liable with its 
principal, G & M Phils., Inc., under the attendant facts and 
circumstances.


Suretyship is a contractual relation resulting from an agreement whereby
 one person, the surety, engages to be answerable for the debt, default 
or miscarriage of another, known as the principal.
[5]



Where the surety bound itself solidarily with the principal obligor, the
 former is so dependent on the principal debtor such that the surety is 
considered in law as being the same party as the debtor in relation to 
whatever is adjudged touching the obligation of the latter, and their 
liabilities are interwoven as to be inseparable.
[6]

  The suretyâs liability is solidary but the nature of its undertaking 
is such that unless and until the principal debtor is held liable it 
does not incur liability.


When the herein petitioner, Empire Insurance Company, entered into a 
suretyship agreement with G & M Phils., Inc., it bound itself to
 
answer for the debt or default of the latter. And, since the POEA and 
NLRC found the said recruitment agency liable to private respondent, 
petitionerâs liability likewise proceeds from such a finding. As a 
surety, petitioner is primarily liable to private respondent, as 
judgment creditor, for her monetary claims against its principal, G 
& M Phils., Inc., and is immediately bound to pay and satisfy 
the 
same.


Time and again, this court has pronounced that claims of overseas 
workers should be acted upon with sympathy, and allowed if warranted, 
conformably to the constitutional mandate for the protection of the 
working class.
[7]
 
 Private 
employment agencies are held to be jointly and severally liable with the
 foreign-based employer for any violation of the recruitment agreement 
or contract of employment.
[8]



POEA has thus promulgated a rule requiring private recruitment agencies 
to set up cash and surety bonds. The purpose of the required surety bond
 is to insure that if the rights of overseas workers are violated by 
their employer, recourse would still be available to them against the 
local companies that recruited them for the foreign principal.
[9]



It bears stressing that surety companies may be ordered impleaded by the
 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) in administrative 
complaints against recruitment agencies, on surety bonds posted, and are
 bound by the judgment of POEA.
[10]
  This Court discerns no reason why the said 
rule should not apply to herein petitioner.



WHEREFORE,
 the petition under consideration
 is hereby 
DISMISSED and the appealed decision of respondent NLRC AFFIRMED. No 
pronouncement as to costs.


SO ORDERED.
