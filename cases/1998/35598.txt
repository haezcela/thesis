ABD OVERSEAS MANPOWER
CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, MARS
INTERNATIONAL MANPOWER, INC. AND MOHMINA MACARAYA, RESPONDENTS.

ROMERO, J.:


Can an
accredited transferee recruitment agent of a foreign employer/recruitment
office be held liable under POEA Rules and Regulations (POEA Rules) for the
illegal dismissal of an overseas worker who filed the case prior to the
transferee agentâs accreditation?


In December
1989, respondent Mohmina Macaraya applied for employment as a dressmaker with
respondent Mars International Manpower, Inc. (MARS).  After paying MARS the amount of P12,000.00 as processing or recruitment
fee, she signed a two-year employment contract whereby she would earn a monthly
salary of US$250.00. Without her knowledge, however, MARS submitted to the POEA
an overseas contract worker information sheet stating that she would be
employed as a domestic helper for two years with a monthly salary of US$200.00.


On January 30,
1990, Macaraya was deployed to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Her employer took the only copy of her employment contract and
never returned it to her.  She was made
to work as a domestic helper over her objections and in violation of the
contract she signed in Manila.  After
working for three months and thirteen days, Macaraya was dismissed by her
employer, paid merely 700.00 Saudi riyals, and repatriated to the Philippines
on May 13, 1990.


Immediately upon
her arrival in the Philippines, Macaraya filed with the POEA a complaint
[1]
 for illegal dismissal and salary
underpayment/ nonpayment against MARS, M.S. Al Babtain Recruitment Office and
Times Surety and Insurance Co.  Later, in
her position paper, she included claims for overtime pay and attorneyâs fees.
MARS filed an answer to the complaint on July 5, 1990, through its president
and general manager, Adelaida Manabat. 


After several
hearings, with hopes of an amicable settlement getting more remote, the case
was submitted for decision.  On January
9, 1992, MARS filed a manifestation and motion praying that petitioner ABD
Overseas Manpower Corporation be impleaded in the case, because the latter
apparently became the accredited recruitment agency in this country of M.S. Al
Babtain Recruitment Office on September 8, 1990.  Thus, after being summoned, petitioner filed an answer alleging
affirmative and special defenses, notably, that MARS had no cause of action
against it.  Petitioner also filed a
cross-claim against MARS which the latter never answered.


On January 12,
1993, the POEA, ruling that Macaraya had been illegally dismissed as both her
foreign employer and recruitment agency failed to prove that the dismissal was
for a just and valid cause, rendered a decision,
[2]
 the dispositive portion of which
reads as follows:


âWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby
rendered in favor of the complainant Mohmina Macaraya and against respondents
ABD Overseas Manpower Corporation and M.S. Al Babtain Recruitment Office,
ordering the latter to pay, jointly and severally, to complainant the following
amounts:


1.
             
FOUR
THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN & 39/100 US DOLLARS (US$4,113.39) or its
equivalent in Philippine Currency at the time of payment, representing the
salaries corresponding to the unexpired portion of complainantâs contract; and


2.
             
SIX
HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX & 71/100 US DOLLARS (US$686.71) less SEVEN HUNDRED SAUDI
RIYALS (SR 700.00), or its equivalent in Philippine Currency, at the time of
actual payment, representing the salary differentials.


All other claims are dismissed for
lack of merit.


The Complaint and the Cross-claim
against Mars International Manpower Inc. is (sic) likewise dismissed for lack
of merit.


SO ORDERED.â


On the issue of
whether or not petitioner should be liable with her foreign employer for the
monetary awards, the POEA, relying on Section 6, Rule I, Book III, of the POEA
Rules, declared that:


â(The r)ecords undisputably show
that the foreign principal and now co-respondent M.S. Al Babtain Recruitment
Office of Saudi Arabia is presently accredited to ABD which is valid up to 06
August 1992. This fact was established by a Certification dated 07 November
1991 issued by the Accreditation Branch, this Administration.


The Office is convinced that
respondent ABD was not fully aware of the import and consequences of transfer
of accreditation it entered into and between the other respondents, which
transfer was duly registered with and approved by the Accreditation Branch. But
ignorance of the same does not serve as a valid excuse in defeating its
liability or obligation to the complainant.


As a
consequence, the transferee agency, ABD, now assumes full and complete
responsibility to the contractual obligation of the principal, M.S. Al Babtain
Recruitment Office(,) to herein complainant originally recruited and processed
by the former agency, MARS.â
[3]


On appeal to the
National Labor Relations Commission, petitioner prayed for the reversal of the
POEAâs decision and the invalidation of Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA
Rules, citing the rule against unjust enrichment.  Thus, it alleged:  


â14.1 Macaraya was deployed 
January
30, 1990
 by MARS; she stayed and worked in Riyadh only for three (3) months
and 13 days and was repatriated on 
May 13, 1990
. She filed the complaint
against MARS on 
May 14, 1990.
 Hence, her 
cause of action ripened
and/or accrued as of that early date
 as 
against MARS
, her placement
agency. Further, it is significant to state here that MARS 
filed its answer

to the complaint on 
July 5, 1990
 wherein it made admissions and averred
its affirmative defenses by way of confession and avoidance of liability. How
then could ABD be made to `assume full and complete responsibility to all
contractual obligationsâ under the aforecited Rule when the accreditation of
M.S. Al Babtain in its favor was made only on 
September 3, 1990
 per POEA
records, and was only `impleadedâ in this case by motion of MARS on 
January
9, 1992
?


14.2 When
MARS filed its answer on July 5, 1990, 
long before ABD was made a party
respondent
, it caused a joinder of issues in the case. Under the
well-settled principle of estoppel, it cannot (after filing such answer) now be
heard to say 
one and a half years later
 (on January 9, 1992 when it
impleaded ABD in the case) that ABD must `be summoned to answer for the claims
of herein Complainant.â x x x.  That
late, and in filing its answer to the complaint, MARS is certainly estopped
from shifting to ABD whatever liability it had under the contract it entered
into with Macaraya, or for any violations thereof by its principal, or any POEA
rules/regulations - - 
which all accrued/occurred when accreditation was NOT
yet transferred to ABD.
 Ignoring these facts/ circumstances constitute a
clear case of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Hon. Administrator.â
[4]
 (Underscoring supplied)


By resolution
dated March 21, 1994,
[5]
 the NLRC dismissed the appeal.  Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration met
the same fate on August 10, 1994.
[6]
 Hence, this petition for
certiorari. 


Petitioner
alleges that in the assailed resolution of March 21, 1994, the NLRC merely
quoted the findings of the POEA Administrator and concluded that it should
âassume full and complete responsibility to the contractual obligationâ of the
foreign principal to Macaraya. Petitioner questions the failure of the NLRC to
make  âcategorical rulings on the
issuesâ it had raised in its memorandum on appeal and, therefore, the NLRC
should be charged with âevasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to
perform the duty enjoinedâ by law.  MARS
had allegedly already answered the complaint when petitioner became the
transferee recruitment agency.  Petitioner was impleaded in the case one-and-a-half years after the
filing of MARSâ answer to the complaint.  Hence, the failure of MARS to prove the legality of Macarayaâs dismissal
from employment should not mean that the same burden should fall upon
petitioner who was not even privy to Macarayaâs employment contract.  If it were to be held liable for the
monetary awards in favor of Macaraya, then it would result in undue enrichment
on the part of MARS.  It must be noted
that none of these allegations was mentioned in the March 21, 1994, resolution.


Thus, after
stating the facts that are clearly culled from the POEA decision, the questioned
resolution of March 21, 1994, quotes the discussion of the POEA on the
liabilities for monetary awards of petitioner and its foreign principal.  Consequently, in the nine-page resolution,
the NLRC merely contributed two pages, including its conclusions, 
viz
.:


âAfter a careful perusal of the
records of the case, We agree with the POEA Administrator findings and
conclusion th(a)t the transferee agency, ABD must assume full and complete
responsibility to the contractual obligation of the principal, M.S. Al Babtain
Recruitment Office to the complainant who was recruited by MARS.


Section 6, Rule I,
Book III of the POEA Rules and Regulation provides:
[7]
 x x x 


It is clear from the aforementioned
provision of the POEA Rules and Regulation that the transferee agency shall
assume full and complete responsibility to all contractual obligations of the
principals to its workers originally recruited and processed by its former
agency.


In the case at bar, respondent ABD
Overseas Manpower Corporation(,) being the transferee agency(,) must assume
(the) full liability of the principal, M.S. Al Babtain(,) to the complainant
originally recruited and process(ed) by its former agency(,) Mars International
Manpower Inc.


We find no grave abuse of
discretion on the part of the POEA Administrator.


WHEREFORE,
in view of the foregoing considerations, the Motion for Reconsideration
[8]
 is dismissed for lack of
merit.


SO ORDERED.â


Section 13, Rule
VII of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC provides as follows:


âSEC. 13. 
Form of Decision/Resolution/Order
.
â The Decision/ Resolution shall state clearly and distinctly the findings of
facts, issues and conclusions of law on which it is based and the relief
granted, if any. If the decision or resolution involves monetary awards, the
same shall contain the specific amount awarded as of the date the decision is
rendered.â


This provision
of the Rules is obviously in consonance with Section 14, Article VIII of the
Constitution providing that â(n)o decision shall be rendered by any court without
expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is
based.â Interpreting this constitutional provision, in Nicos Industrial
Corporation v. Court of Appeals,
[9]
 the Court said:


âIt is a requirement of due process
that the parties to a litigation be informed of how it was decided, with an
explanation of the factual and legal reasons that led to the conclusions of the
court. The court cannot simply say that judgment is rendered in favor of X and
against Y and just leave it at that without any justification whatsoever for
its action. The losing party is entitled to know why he lost, so he may appeal
to a higher court, if permitted, should he believe that the decision should be
reversed. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and
the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was
reached and is especially prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to
pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal.â


In this case,
the NLRC left petitioner âin the darkâ by its failure to discuss why the facts
it pointed out in its memorandum on appeal would not affect the unqualified
application of Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules.  It is possible that the NLRC fully believed
that said rule should be applied literally.  This should not, however, have given premium to brevity in its
resolution
[10]
 to the point that the very
underpinnings for a partyâs appeal to it would be completely disregarded and
left unresolved. As this Court declared, â(b)revity is doubtless an admirable
trait, but it should not and cannot be substituted for substance.â
[11]
 The need for a clear dissertation
on the issues raised on appeal was underscored in Francisco v. Permskul.
[12]
 In said case, although the Court
upheld the validity of Section 40 of
 Batas Pambansa Blg
. 120, allowing
the rendition of memorandum decisions, especially in appealed cases, it
nevertheless stated that:


âDespite the convenience afforded
by the memorandum decision, it is still desirable that the appellate judge
exert some effort in restating in his own words the findings of fact of the
lower court and presenting his own interpretation of the law instead of merely
parroting the language of the court 
a quo
 as if he cannot do any better.
There must be less intellectual indolence and more pride of authorship in the
writing of a decision, especially if it comes from an appellate court.


It ill becomes an appellate judge
to write his rulings with a pair of scissors and a pot of paste as if he were a
mere researcher. He is an innovator, not an echo. The case usually becomes
progressively simpler as it passes through the various levels of appeal and
many issues become unimportant or moot and drop along the way. The appellate
judge should prune the cluttered record to make the issues clearer. He cannot
usually do this by simply mimicking the lower court. He must use his own
perceptiveness in unraveling the rollo and his own discernment in discovering
the law. No less importantly, he must use his own language in laying down his
judgment. And in doing so, he should also guard against torpidity lest his
pronouncements excite no more fascination than a technical tract on the values
of horse manure as a fertilizer. A little style will help liven the opinion
trapped in the tortuous lexicon of the law with all its whereases and
wherefores. A judicial decision does not have to be a bore.â


We should add
that much more than being stylish, a decision or resolution, especially one
resolving an appeal, should directly meet the issues for resolution; otherwise,
the appeal would be pointless. It is immaterial that the NLRC is a
quasi-judicial body and not a regular court.  In any controversy, the appellant needs enlightenment on the issues that
befuddle him.  Accordingly, assuming
that petitioner should indeed be liable to Macaraya, the NLRC should have
discussed why Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules should be applied
notwithstanding the factual circumstances pointed out by petitioner.  As it was, petitionerâs theory that the case
does not merit the application of Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules
was merely glossed over, such that it was left with no other recourse but to
file a motion for reconsideration and, after its denial, the instant petition. 


Worth stressing
is the fact that petitioner does not question the validity of the monetary
awards to Macaraya.  The basic issue
here is:  âAs between petitioner and
MARS, who should be held liable for such awards?â  This can only be resolved by interpreting Section 6, Rule I, Book
III of the POEA Rules which states as follows:


âSEC. 6. 
Transfer of
Accreditation
. â The accreditation of a principal or a project may be
transferred to another agency provided that transfer shall not involve any
diminution of wages and benefits of workers.


The transferee agency in these
instances shall comply with the requirements for accreditation and shall assume
full and complete responsibility for all contractual obligations of the
principals to its workers originally recruited and processed by the former
agency. Prior to the transfer of accreditation, the Administration shall notify
the previous agency and principal of such application.â


A cursory
reading of this provision lends the impression that an accreditation  transferee assumes the contractual
responsibility of the transferor under all circumstances, without
qualification.  We find, however, that a
strict application of said 
proviso
 in this case may result in a grave
injustice to petitioner which became liable only when it âstepped into the
shoes,â as it were, of its predecessor after the issues had been met in the
illegal dismissal case filed against the latter, and after the POEA had failed
to discharge its duty of deciding the simple illegal dismissal case with
dispatch. 


The rule on
transfer of accreditation was prescribed under the general policies of the POEA
to âestablish the environment conducive to the continued operations of
legitimate, responsible and professional private agenciesâ and to âafford
protection to Filipino workers and their families, promote their interests and
safeguard their welfare.â
[13]
 In line with these policies, Book
III of the same rules provides for the accreditation of a principal or âany
foreign person, partnership or corporation hiring Filipino workers through an
agency.â
[14]
 Principals may be accredited in
this country only through licensed local agencies.
[15]
 A land-based principal shall be
accredited to only one agency but the POEA may grant accreditation to a second
agent as may be deemed necessary.
[16]
 In the same manner, the
accreditation of a principal may be transferred to another agency under the
aforequoted Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules.  


In the case at
bar, petitioner became the accredited recruitment agency of the principal, M.S.
Al Babtain Recruitment Office, on September 3, 1990, after MARS had filed on
July 5, 1990, its answer to Macarayaâs complaint for illegal dismissal.  Petitioner got involved only on January 9,
1992, when it was impleaded in the case upon MARSâ motion.  The case having been submitted for decision
long before it became a party, petitioner naturally filed an answer alleging
its own claims against MARS.


Under the Rules
of Court which were then in effect and applicable to the case at bar, when MARS
failed to file an answer to petitionerâs cross-claim, it should have been
declared in default with respect to such claim.
[17]
 In labor cases, however, technical
rules of procedure are not applicable,
[18]
 but may apply only by analogy or in
a suppletory character, for instance, when there is a need to attain
substantial justice and an expeditious, practical and convenient solution to a
labor problem.
[19]
 Hence, when the POEA  opted  to  overlook petitionerâs
cross-claim against MARS, petitioner 


was denied
substantial justice.


MARS impleaded
petitioner in the case after it had been submitted for decision and 
one-and-a-half
years
 after it had filed its answer.  During this hiatus, the case lay dormant in the POEA.  It should be noted that petitioner became
the accredited recruitment agency on September 3, 1990, two months 
after 
MARS
had filed its answer to the complaint.  The POEAâs inaction 
ad interim
 provided MARS with an opportunity
to escape liability. 


Basic principles
of justice and equity, however, dictate that MARS should not be totally cleared
of its liability to Macaraya under the peculiar circumstances of this
case.  Section 6, Rule II, Book III of
the POEA Rules may not be used as a shield against liability by a recruitment
agency that has been substituted by a foreign principal as its local
recruitment agency after it has clearly incurred liability in favor of an
overseas worker.  After all, the POEA is
presumed by law to have intended right and justice to prevail
[20]
 in promulgating its rules.  Consequently, considering that it was MARS
with whom Macaraya entered into a contract and that it had been accorded due
process at the proceedings before the POEA, it is but meet and just that MARS
be the one to be held accountable for her claims.


In so ruling,
the Court is not in any way invalidating Section 6, Rule II, Book III of the
POEA Rules. The presumption of its validity remains. Its application in this
case should, however, be an exception to the rule.  Petitioner shall pay Macaraya the amount due her under the
assailed POEA decision, without prejudice to its right to be reimbursed by MARS
under the provision of the Civil Code that â(w)hoever pays for another may
demand from the debtor what he has paid.â
[21]


WHEREFORE
, the resolutions of the NLRC dated
March 21, 1994, and August 10, 1994,  are  hereby  AFFIRMED,  subject to the modification that respondent Mars International Manpower,
Inc. shall reimburse petitioner ABD Overseas Manpower Corporation the amount
awarded therein to respondent Mohmina Macaraya.  This Decision is immediately executory.  No costs.
