[ G.R. No. 109383, June 15, 1998 ]


MANILA CENTRAL LINE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. MANILA CENTRAL LINE FREE WORKERS UNION-NATIONAL FEDERATION OF LABOR AND THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


This is a petition for certiorari to set aside the resolution 
dated October 10, 1991 of the National Labor Relations Commission in 
NLRC NCR Case No. 000977-90, dismissing the appeal of petitioner Manila 
Central Line Corporation from the order of Labor Arbiter Donato G. 
Quinto, Jr., in NLRC NCR Case No. 02-00813-90, as well as the resolution
 dated March 11, 1993 of the NLRC, denying reconsideration.

This case arose out of a collective bargaining deadlock between 
petitioner and private respondent Manila Central Line Free Workers 
Union-National Federation of Labor. The partiesâ collective bargaining 
agreement had expired on March 15, 1989. As the parties failed to reach 
new agreement, private respondent sought the aid of the National 
Conciliation and Mediation Board on October 30, 1989, but the deadlock 
remained unresolved.

On February 9, 1990, private respondent filed a âPetition for 
Compulsory Arbitrationâ in the Arbitration Branch for the National 
Capital Region of the National Labor Relations Commission. At the 
initial hearing before the labor arbiter, the parties declared that 
conciliation efforts before the NCMB had terminated and it was their 
desire to submit the case for compulsory arbitration. Accordingly, they 
were required to submit their position papers and proposals, which they 
did, and in which they indicated portions of their respective proposals 
to which they agreed, leaving the rest for arbitration.
[1]


On September 28, 1990, the labor arbiter rendered a decision 
embodying provisions for a new collective bargaining agreement. The 
dispositive portion of his decision reads:



WHEREFORE, the petitioner UNION and the respondent COMPANY are 
directed to execute and formalize their new five-year collective 
bargaining agreement (CBA) retroactive to the date of expiry of the 
1986-1989 CBA by adopting the provisions in the aforementioned test 
which incorporated therein in the disposition set forth by this 
Arbitrator within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Decision
  


SO ORDERED.
[2]






Petitioner appealed, but its appeal was denied by the NLRC in its 
questioned resolution of October 10, 1991. On March 11, 1993, the NLRC 
denied petitionerâs motion for reconsideration. Hence, this petition 
with the following assignment of errors:



a)   The NLRC erred in affirming the Labor Arbiterâs decision â
  




1.    increasing the commission rate, the incentive pay, the 
salaries and wages of the fixed income employees covered by the CBA.
    


2.    granting P500.00 signing bonus to the complainant-appellee; and 
    


3.    holding that the effectivity of the renegotiated CBA shall 
be retroactive to March 15, 1989, the expiry date of the old CBA
    




b)   There are serious errors in the findings of facts of the Labor
 Arbiter which were unqualified affirmed by the NLRC and which justify 
the review by this Honorable SUPREME COURT.
  


c)    The NLRC erred in upholding the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter; and 
  


d)   The NLRC erred in affirming the finalization of the CBA by the
 Labor Arbiter in disregard of the provisions agreed upon by the 
parties.
  




The petition is without merit. We shall deal with these contentions 
in the order they are presented, with the exception of the argument 
concerning the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter (par. (c)), which we 
shall treat first since it raises a threshold question.

First
. Despite the fact that it agreed with the union to
 submit their dispute to the labor arbiter for arbitration, petitioner 
questions the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter to render the decision 
in question. Petitioner contends that the policy of the law now is to 
encourage resort to conciliation and voluntary arbitration as Art 250(e)
 of the Labor Code provides.

Indeed, the Labor Code formerly provided that if the parties in 
collective bargaining fail to reach an agreement, the Bureau of Labor 
Relations should call them to conciliation meetings and, if its efforts 
were not successful, certify the dispute to a labor arbiter for 
compulsory arbitrarion.
[3]
 But
 this was changed by R.A.No. 6715 which took effect on March 21, 1989. 
Art 250(e) of the Labor Code now provides that if effects of 
conciliation fail, the Board shall âencourage the parties to submit 
their case to a voluntary arbitrator.â With specific reference to cases 
involving deadlocks in collective bargaining, Art. 262 provides:



Jurisdiction over other labor disputes â The Voluntary Arbitrator 
or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, upon agreement of the parties, shall 
also hear and decide all other labor disputes including unfair labor 
practices and bargaining deadlocks. 




This is what the parties did in this case. After the Board failed to 
resolve the bargaining deadlock between parties, the union filed a 
petition for compulsory arbitration in the Arbitration Branch of the 
NLRC. Petitioner joined the petition and the case was submitted for 
decision. Although the unionâs petition was for âcompulsory 
arbitration,â the subsequent agreement of petitioner to submit the 
matter for arbitration in effect made the arbitration a voluntary one. 
The essence of voluntary arbitration, after all is that it is by 
agreement of the parties, rather than compulsion of law, that a matter 
is submitted for arbitration.
[4]

 It does not matter that the person chosen as arbitrator is a labor 
arbiter who, under Art 217 of the Labor Code, is charged with the 
compulsory arbitration of certain labor cases. There is nothing in the 
law that prohibits these 
labor arbiters
 from also acting as 
voluntary arbitrators
 as long as the parties agree to have him hear and decide their dispute.

Moreover, petitioner must be deemed to be estopped from 
questioning the authority of Labor Arbiter Donato G. Quinto, Jr., to act
 as voluntary arbitrator and render a decision in this case. Petitioner 
agreed together with the union, to refer their dispute for arbitration 
to him. It was only after the decision was rendered that petitioner 
raised the question of lack of jurisdiction. Even then, petitioner did 
so only for the first time in a âsupplemental memorandum of appealâ to 
the NLRC.
[5]
 As the NLRC, through Commissioner Romeo B. Putong held, it was too late in the day for petitioner to do this.
[6]


Indeed, it is inconsistent for petitioner to contend, on the 
other hand, that this case should have been resolved through voluntary 
arbitration and, on the other, to follow the procedure for compulsory 
arbitration and, appealing the decision of the labor arbiter to the NLRC
 and subsequently questioning the latterâs decision in 
Luzon Development Bank v. Luzon Development Bank Employees Association
,
[7]

 this case, considered as a special civil action for certiorari to set 
aside the decision of a voluntary arbitrator, should have been referred,
 as a matter of policy, to the Court of Appeals. However, it was not 
evident in the beginning from a cursory consideration of the pleadings 
that what actually took place in the labor agency was a proceeding for 
voluntary arbitration. Accordingly, so as not to delay the disposition 
of this case, we have thought on balance that this case should be 
retained and decided on the merits.

Second
. In par. (a) (1) and par. (b) of its assignment 
of errors, petitioner questions factual findings of the labor arbiter 
and the NLRC. Such findings are generally held to be binding, and even 
final, so long as they are substantially supported by evidence in the 
record of the case.
[8]
 This is
 especially so where, as here, the agency and a subordinate one which 
heard the case in the first instance are in full agreement as to the 
facts.
[9]


The decisions of both the NLRC and the labor arbiter contain an 
exhaustive discussion of the issues, belying petitionerâs claim that 
they did not fully consider the evidence and appreciate what it claims 
are the âdire economic straitsâ it is in. This is evident from the 
following portion of the labor arbiterâs order dated September 28, 1990,
 which NLRC adopted:



From the foregoing allegations of the parties and as expound (sic),
 discussed and/or argued by them in their respective position paper, the
 disagreement, or deadlock, as we say it, focus (sic) and centers on the
 so called âeconomic issuesâ particularly on the provisions on Salaries 
and Wages. 


Petitioner-Union proposed that the commission for drivers, 
conductors and conductresses shall be 10% and 8%, respectively of their 
gross collections. In addition, as incentive pay, it proposed that 
drivers, conductors and conductresses shall be entitled to incentive pay
 as follows: (a) For a quota of P2,600.00, the incentive should be 
P40.00; (b) for a quota of P2,875.00, the incentive should be P50.00 and
 (c) for a quota of P3,155.00 the incentive pay should be P60.00.
  


Further, petitioner-Union, insofar as the âfixed income employeesâ 
are concerned, they proposed that they should be granted a salary/wage 
increase as follows: (a) effective March 15, 1989 â P12.00; (b) 
Effective March 15, 1990 â P10.00; and (c) effective March 15, 1991 â 
P8.00. 


Respondent, on the other hand, proposes that the commission for 
drivers and conductor/tresses shall be 8.5% and 6.5% of their gross 
collection, respectively. And in addition, these drivers and 
conductors/tresses shall be entitled to an incentive pay based on the 
following quota, to wit: (a) for a quota of P3,276.00, the incentive pay
 is P35.00; (b) for a quota of P3,635.00, it is P45.00; and for a quoa 
of P3,994.00, it is P55.00. Respondent management has no proposal 
insofar as grant of increase/s to fixed income employeesâ subject of the
 bargaining unit. 


As noted at present under the old CBA, the commission for drivers 
and conductor/tresses is 8% and 6%, respectively. During and in the 
negotiation, respondent proposes to raise this rate by .5% thus making 
it 8.5 and 6.5 respectively. Respondent in proposing an increase of .5% 
justifies the same by saying that such is only what it can afford as it 
had been incurring financial losses as shown by Financial Statement it 
submitted in evidence. This was rejected by the union which proposes 
that the rate of the commission be raised to 10% and 8% respectively, 
from 8% and 6%, or an increase by 2% respectively. The union debunked 
the claim fo the respondent-company that it had been financially 
suffering and had claim (sic) that it had earned profit in all the years
 that it had been under operation.
  


A look at the partiesâ proposal and counter-proposal shows that the
 union was demanding that the rate be increased to 10% and 8% from the 
old rate of 8% and 6% or an increase of 2% while that of the company 
effectively increase the rate by .5% to make the rate at 8.5% and 6.5%. 
From this, it appears that the disagreement lies on how much would the 
increase equivalent to at least 25% for the drivers and at least 33% for
 the conductor/tresses, while that which proposed (sic) by the company 
shows an increase of at least 6% and 8% respectively. The difference 
between the parties proposal and counter-proposal is at least 19% and 
25%, respectively. With this disagreement in this difference, it is 
thought of to be practical and reasonable to meet at the middle of the 
difference in the rate by dividing the same into two. Hence, the 
increase in the rate should be from the present 8% and 6% to 8.75% and 
6.75%. However, in order to make the increase realistic it is opined 
that it should be rounded off to the nearest full number that is to 9% 
and 7%, respectively. 


As regards the incentive pay, the following appears:






OLD CBA


RESPONDENTâS PROPOSAL


UNIONâS PROPOSAL

55.00    


3,155.00    


60.00    








As can be gleaned from the above respondent raised the quota but 
maintained the rate for the incentive pay, while the union lowers (sic) 
the quota and raises (sic) the rate for the incentive. To the mind of 
this arbitrator, he deems it proper and fair for both parties, to adopt 
the quota as proposed by the respondent and the rate for the incentive 
pay as proposed by the union. It is believe (sic) that such is fair and 
reasonable because as appearing in the partiesâ proposal and counter 
proposal, it would seem that they are trying to out-wit each other. 
Hence, such would be as follows:








Quota


Rate of Incentive Pay






P3,276.00 


P40.00






 3,635.00 


 50.00






 3,994.00 


 60.00






Another issue where the parties are in statements (sic) is the matter
 of increase in the salary and wages of the fixed income employees 
covered by the CBA. The Union proposes an increase of P12.00, P10.00 and
 P8.00 to be spread in the three-year period, while the company did not 
submit a proposal for an increase claiming that it cannot afford to give
 any increase as it had suffered financial difficulty. However, as 
already discussed earlier where it is found that respondent, as shown by
 its financial statement, is not really in the verge of financial 
collapse, it is believed that it is reasonable and fair to the parties, 
particularly to the union that increase would be mandated. However, we 
could not adopt in toto the proposal of the union. Instead, we are to 
adopt the increase as provided under the old CBA, that is, P6.00 for the
 first year, P5.00 for the second year and P4.00 for the third year.
[10]






Petitioner contends, however, that the labor arbiter has a duty to 
indicate in his order every relevant proof necessary to show that the 
opposing partyâs evidence is superior to that of petitioner. This is not
 so. The quantum of proof required in proceedings before administrative 
agencies is âsubstantial evidence,â not overwhelming or preponderant 
evidence.
[11]
 The quoted 
portion of the labor arbiterâs order shows that the proposals of the 
parties as well as petitionerâs financial statements were carefully 
considered by him in arriving at his judgment. As the Solicitor General 
states:




Nor did respondent NLRC overlook the protestations of the COMPANY 
that it is suffering from âgargantuan economic trouble.â This assertion,
 however, was sufficiently refuted by the UNION by presenting proof that
 the COMPANY had acquired a bus terminal area in Tunasan. Moreover, the 
COMPANY had just imported machines to recondition their old buses. Also,
 as can be seen in the 1992 Financial Statement of the COMPANY had just 
imported machines to recondition their old buses. Also, as can be seen 
in the1992 Financial Statement of the COMPANY, it acquired new buses 
worth P2,400,000.00. These facts verify the findings of the Labor 
Arbiter that the COMPANY is not on the verge of financial 
collapseâ¦.Also, the COMPANY had offered an increase of .5% but in the 
same breath, it claims that it can hardly maintain the commission rate 
of 8% and 6%. There is a contradiction of facts right there and then, 
which considerably weakens its assertions 


The increase in commission rate will not really affect the income 
of the COMPANY. By their very nature, commissions will only be given to 
the employees if the COMPANY receives more income. They are given in the
 form of incentives or encouragement so that employees would be inspired
 to put a little more industry on their particular tasks. This is unlike
 salaries and wages which are fixed amounts and which should be given to
 the employees regardless of whether the COMPANY is making any 
collection or not. Therefore, the employees are merely asking a 
percentage of the earnings of the COMPANY, which they, through their 
efforts, helped produce.
  


As regards the incentive pay increase, the COMPANYâs financial 
position was also taken into consideration. It appears that the COMPANY 
and the UNION were trying to outwit each other in their respective 
proposals. Thus, the position adopted by the Labor Arbiter - - 
increasing the quota and the amount of incentive â is a middle ground 
which is fair to both parties. 


The increase in salaries and wages was premised on the findings of 
the Labor Arbiter that the COMPANY was not on the verge of financial 
collapse and that an increase would be mandated, particularly taking 
into consideration the inflation or increase in the cost of living in 
the subsequent years after the CBA was finalized. In adopting the wage 
increase rates provided in the old CBA, the financial condition of the 
COMPANY as well as the needs of the employees were taken into 
consideration. When conclusions of the Labor Arbiter are sufficiently 
corroborated by the evidence on record, the same should be respected by 
the appellate tribunals since he is in a better position to assess or 
evaluate the credibility of the contending parties [CDCP Tollways 
Operation Employees and Workers Union v. NLRC, 211 SCRA 58)â¦.
[12]






Nor is the grant of a P500.00 âsigning bonusâ to employees 
unreasonable or arbitrary. The amount is a modest sum, to be given by 
petitioner only once, in order to make employees finally agree to the 
new CBA. In ordering payment of this amount, the labor arbiter acted in 
accordance with Art. 262-A of the Labor Code which provides in part:



Procedures
. â The voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall have the power to hold hearings, receive evidence and 
take whatever action is necessary to resolve the issue or issues subject to dispute
, including efforts to effect a voluntary settlement between parties. (emphasis added)
  




Third
. Petitioner also contends that in ordering a new CBA 
to be effective on March 15, 1989, the expiry date of the old CBA, the 
labor arbiter acted contrary to Art. 253-A of the Labor Code. This 
provision states, among others, that:



Any agreement on such other provision of the Collective Bargaining 
Agreement entered into within six (6) months from the date of the expiry
 of the term of such other provisions as fixed in such Collective 
Bargaining Agreement, shall retroact to the day immediately following 
such date. If any such agreement is entered into beyond six months, the 
parties shall agree on the duration of retroactivity thereof. In case of
 a deadlock in the renegotiation of the collective bargaining agreement,
 the parties may exercise their rights under this Code.
  




Art. 253-A refers to collective bargaining agreements entered into by
 the parties as a result of their mutual agreement. The CBA in this 
case, on the other hand, is part of an arbitral award. As such, it may 
be made retroactive to the date of expiration of the previous agreement.
 As held in 
St. Lukeâs Medical Center, Inc. v. Torres
:



Finally, the effectivity of the Order of January 28, 1991, must 
retroact to the date of the expiration of the previous CBA, contrary to 
the position of petitioner. Under the circumstances of the case, Article
 253-A cannot be properly applied to herein case. As correctly stated by
 public respondent in his assailed Order of April 12, 1991 dismissing 
petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration â
  




Anent the alleged lack of basis for the retroactivity to 
provisions awarded, we would stress that the provision of law invoked by
 the Hospital. Article 253-A of the Labor Code, speaks of agreements by 
and between the parties, and not arbitral awards . . . (p. 818 Rollo).
    




Therefore, in the absence of a specific provision of law 
prohibiting retroactivity of the effectivity of arbitral awards issued 
by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Article 263(g) of the Labor Code, 
such as herein involved, public respondent is deemed vested with plenary
 and discretionary powers to determine the effectivity thereof.
[13]






Indeed, petitioner has not shown that the question of effectivity was
 not included in the general agreement of the parties to submit their 
dispute for arbitration. To the contrary, as to the order of the labor 
arbiter states, this question was among those submitted for arbitration 
by the parties:



As regards the âEffectivity and Durationâ clause, the company 
proposes that the collective bargaining agreement shall take effect only
 upon its signing and shall remain in full force and effect for a period
 of five years. The union proposes that the agreement shall take effect 
retroactive to March 15, 1989, the expiration date of the old CBA. 


And after an evaluation of the partiesâ respective contention and 
argument thereof, it is believed that the union is fair and reasonable. 
It is the observation of this Arbitrator that in almost subsequent CBAs,
 the effectivity of the renegotiated CBA, usually and most often is made
 effective retroactive to the date when the immediately proceeding CBA 
expires so as to give a semblance of continuity. Hence, for this 
particular case, it is believed that there is nothing wrong adopting the
 stand of the union, that is that this CBA be made retroactive effective
 March 15, 1989.
[14]






Fourth
. It is finally contended that the labor arbiter 
disregarded many provisions of the old CBA which the parties had 
âretained, improved and agreed upon,â with the result that âthe CBA 
finalized by the Honorable Labor Arbiter does not reflect the true 
intention of the parties.â
[15]

 Petitioner does not specify, however, what provisions of the old CBA 
were disregarded by the labor arbiter. Consequently, this allegation 
should simply be dismissed.

WHEREFORE
, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.
