MARTINEZ, J.:


This is a petition for mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of 
Court which seeks to compel the Office of the Ombudsman to proceed with 
its preliminary investigation of respondents on complaint for violation 
of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 and thereafter to file the corresponding 
information in court against said respondents.

The pertinent facts of the case are as follows:

On July 6, 1990, the Republic of the Philippines filed with the 
Regional Trial Court of Pasay City an Amended Petition for Determination
 of Just Compensation for lands expropriated under B.P. Blg. 340. In 
said case, entitled 
âRepublic of the Philippines v. Salem 
Investment Corporation, Ma. Del Carmen Roxas de Elizalde, Concepcion 
Cabarrus vda. de Santos, Mila dela Rama and Inocentes dela Rama, Heirs 
of Eduardo M. Lesaca and Carmen Padillaâ
, and docketed as Civil
 Case No. 7327, the Republic, as petitioner, sought the following 
reliefs from the court: 1) the appointment of commissioners under 
Section 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court for the determination of just 
compensation for the lands expropriated by B.P. Blg. 340; and, 2) the 
issuance of an order authorizing petitioner Republic to enter said 
properties and take possession thereof, the required deposit already 
made with the Philippine National Bank and consent having been obtained 
from the abovenamed respondents.
[1]


On August 29, 1990, the Regional Trial Court granted the Motion 
for the issuance of a Writ of Possession filed by the Republic in Civil 
Case No. 7237. In the Writ of Possession it issued, said trial court 
commanded the City Sheriff of Pasay and or his deputies to serve the 
Writ, stating:



âWHEREAS, petitioner filed with this Court on August 15, 1990 a 
Motion for the issuance of a Writ of Possession to the end that 
petitioner be placed in possession of the properties expropriated by the
 Government by virtue of B.P. Bilang 340 after petitioner had deposited 
with the Philippine National Bank on August 9, 1990 the amount of TWELVE
 MILLION NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY (P12, 970, 
350.00) PESOS representing ten (10%) percent of the approximate total 
market value of the properties expropriated; 


WHEREAS, in the Order dated August 28, 1990, the Court GRANTED the 
aforesaid motion of petitioner and has directed the City Sheriff of 
Pasay City and/or his deputies, to place petitioner Republic of the 
Philippines in possession of the expropriated properties;
  


NOW THEREFORE, you are hereon commanded, pursuant to Section 4 of 
B.P. Bilang 340, to place the petitioner Republic of the Philippines to 
the immediate possession and disposition of the following properties and
 improvements thereon, including the power of demolition, if necessary, x
 x xâ
[2]






The Republic of the Philippines was henceforth placed in possession 
of the properties and the houses and other improvements thereon were 
subsequently demolished.

Petitioners eventually filed a complaint on November 19, 1992, 
with the respondent Ombudsman for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 
3019, alleging that:



âThat on or about August 30, 1990 to September 5, 1990, the said 
respondents confederating and in conspiracy with each other, caused the 
demolition of the 7 houses of the complainants in P. Lovina St. cor. 
F.B. Harrison St., Pasay City, with the aid of policemen against and 
over their objection with the use of force causing them undue injury 
through manifest partiality, gross inexcusable negligence or evident bad
 faith, since there is no writ of demolition authorizing said 
demolition, but simply on the basis of a writ of possession issued by 
Judge Sofronio Sayo, without notice to them, even as they were in 
adverse possession thereof. 


âCONTRARY TO LAW.â
[3]






Respondent Office of the Ombudsman, through the Hon. Conrado M. 
Vasquez, dismissed the complaint for lack of evidence on March 30, 1994,
 which petitioners received on May 7, 1994.

In his resolution, the Ombudsman reasoned out in this manner:



âThe property referred to by complainants has been the object of 
expropriation proceedings where the complainantâs claim of ownership had
 already long been foreclosed by judicial action, thus at the time of 
demolition, complainants had no colorable title to the properties. 


Perusing through the complaint sheet specifically the November 19, 
1992 letter of counsel R. Gonzales, we note that it is admitted that the
 demolition was carried out on the basis of a writ of possession issued 
by Judge Sofronio Sayo.
  


âThe above disclosure creates the impression that respondents were 
clothed with the proper judicial armor in causing the demolition and in 
view of the vehement protestation of complainants any ensuing violence, 
fracas or disorder would have been an inevitable consequence. 


âComplainants appear to make an issue about the absence of a writ 
of demolition even if there was an earlier writ of possession issued by 
Judge Sofronio Sayo. 


âThe absence of a writ of demolition does not per se make 
respondents indictable under Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019 as they were merely 
constituting a full execution of a writ, thus complainants and their 
personal properties had to be removed from the premises and the real 
estate be placed fully in the possession of the government. 


âIt is observed that on the day of the demolition, complainantâs 
Administrator surnamed Gatil refused to accept and acknowledge the writ 
of possession thus prompting the demolition crew to initiate the tearing
 down of several structures. 


âSince a writ of possession implies the delivery of possession of 
the land to the successful litigant, a writ of demolition must likewise 
issue especially considering that the latter writ is but a complement of
 the former which with the said writ of demolition would be ineffective.
 To require a successful litigant x x x to institute another action for 
the purpose of obtaining possession of the land adjudged to him would 
foster unnecessary litigation and result in multiplicity of suits. 
(Marcelo vs. Meneasis GIL No. L-15609m April 29, 1960) 


âIt must be noted that the expropriation of the subject property 
had been unduly protracted and that a decisive/concrete action had to be
 undertaken to avert further delay in the EDSA Extension project. 


âThere being sufficient justification and substantial legal grounds
 to take possession of the property and effect demolition, we find no 
basis to indict respondents for violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019.â 
[4]






Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the said resolution but the same was denied in an Order dated June 3, 1995.
[5]


Hence, the present petition, with petitioners setting forth the following reasons relied upon for its allowance:



I
  


THAT RESPONDENT OMBUDSMAN IS NEGLECTING THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ACT 
WHICH THE LAW ENJOINS AS A DUTY RESULTING FROM AN OFFICE IN NOT 
PROCEEDING WITH THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AND FILING THE 
CORRESPONDING INFORMATION IN COURT AGAINST RESPONDENTS FOR VIOLATION OF 
SEC. 3(E), R.A. 3019;
  


II
  


THAT PETITIONERS HAVE NO PLAIN, SPEEDY AND ADEQUATE REMEDY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LAW EXCEPT THE PRESENT PETITION.
  




It is the contention of petitioners that the Ombudsman could be 
compelled to perform his duty to conduct a preliminary investigation as 
he had gravely abused his discretion in dismissing the complaint for 
violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019. Such complaint, noted 
petitioners, was resolved without the Ombudsman ordering the submission 
of counter-affidavits. Even though in conducting a preliminary 
investigation, the Ombudsman was supposed to be guided only by the 
evidence before him, it was a grave abuse of discretion for him to 
dismiss such complaint without receipt of any evidence contradicting 
that of complainants.
[6]


Moreover, the Ombudsman, argued petitioners, gravely abused his 
discretion when he approved of the conclusion that a writ of demolition 
was not needed in demolishing the improvements made by petitioners upon 
the subject property. The Ombudsman agreed with the investigating 
officer that the right to demolish was a privilege granted to 
respondents by virtue of the writ of possession.
[7]


Petitioners prayed that this Court issue a writ of mandamus 
ordering the Ombudsman to require its co-respondents to file their 
counter-affidavits and comply with Sections 3(c ), (d), (e) and (f) of 
Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.
[8]


Petitionersâ arguments are not impressed with merit.

Administrative Order No. 07 of the Office of the Ombudsman, 
otherwise known as âthe Rules of Procedure of the Office of the 
Ombudsman,â specifically Section 2 of Rule II, states:



âSEC. 2. Evaluation. - Upon evaluating the complaint, the investigating officer shall recommend whether it may be: 




a)        dismissed outright for want of palpable merit;
        

        b)        referred to respondent for comment;
        

        c)        indorsed to the proper government office of agency which has jurisdiction over the case;
        

        d)        forwarded to the appropriate officer or official for fact-finding investigation;
        

        e)        referred for administrative adjudication; or
        

        f)         subjected to a preliminary investigation.â






From the above-mentioned provision, it could be seen that the 
Ombudsman does not necessarily have to conduct a preliminary 
investigation upon receipt of a complaint. Should the investigating 
officer find the complaint utterly devoid of merit, then he may 
recommend its outright dismissal. Moreover, it is also within his 
discretion to determine whether or not a preliminary investigation 
should be conducted.

This rule is even buttressed and finds support in the Rules of 
Court, specifically Section 3(b) of Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on 
Criminal Procedure, which states:



âSEC.3. Procedure. - Except as provided for in Section 7 hereof, no
 complaint or information for an offense cognizable by the Regional 
Trial Court shall be filed without a preliminary investigation having 
been first conducted in the following manner: 


xxx xxx xxx xxx
  


(b) Within ten (10) days after the filing of the complaint, the 
investigating officer shall either dismiss the same if he finds no 
ground to continue with the inquiry, or issue a subpoena to the 
respondent, attaching thereto a copy of the complaint, affidavits and 
other supporting documents. Within ten (10) days from receipt thereof, 
the respondent shall submit counter-affidavits and other supporting 
documents. He shall have the right to examine all other evidence 
submitted by the complainant.â
  




Thus, in the case at bar, the investigating officer, Ramon Godinez, 
was not acting without any legal basis for he was indeed clothed with 
the authority to recommend the dismissal of the complaint without going 
through a preliminary investigation. 

This Court can not grant the relief sought by petitioners for the duty sought to be compelled is discretionary in nature.

Mandamus lies to compel the performance, when refused, of a 
ministerial duty, but not to compel the performance of a discretionary 
duty.
[9]
 It will not issue to 
control or review the exercise of discretion of a public officer where 
the law imposes upon said public officer the right and duty to exercise 
his judgment in reference to any matter in which he is required to act. 
It is his judgment that is to be exercised and not that of the court.
[10]


Petitioners also argue that this case would fall under the 
exception to the rule that the writ will not issue to control the 
discretion of the tribunal board or officer since there was a clear 
showing of grave abuse of discretion. This discretion which will stand 
review by mandamus, must be exercised under the law and not contrary to 
law. If in the attempted performance of a discretionary act, the 
official abuses his discretion, so as to amount to a failure to do the 
acts as the law requires, or if by a mistaken view of the law, there has
 in fact been no actual exercise in good faith of the judgment or 
discretion vested in the officer, mandamus is a proper remedy.
[11]


Petitioners claim that this grave abuse of discretion was evident
 when the public respondent concluded that: 1) they no longer had any 
colorable title to the properties as the property was made the object of
 expropriation proceedings and their claim of ownership had long been 
foreclosed by judicial action, and 2) the respondents were clothed with 
the proper judicial armor in causing the demolition.

With regard to the first conclusion, it is of judicial notice that in the case of 
Republic of the Philippines v. Cristina de Knecht and Court of Appeals
,
[12]

 this Court had already made an adjudication on the status of the 
property when it upheld the validity of Batas Pambansa Blg. 340, which 
expropriated the property in question. Furthermore, the issue of 
ownership over the expropriated land had already been laid to rest with 
finality when this Court, in a resolution dated November 20, 1989, 
denied petitionersâ Petition for Review in G.R. No. 89862, entitled 
âCristina de Knecht and Rene Knecht v. Court of Appeals, et. al.,â. The 
motion for reconsideration of this resolution was denied with finality 
in another resolution dated January 17, 1990.
[13]


Anent the second conclusion, respondents were indeed clothed with
 the proper judicial armor. A writ of demolition was no longer necessary
 since B.P. 340 itself gave the power of demolition to the agency or 
instrumentality of the government in charge of the expropriation. 
Section 4 of Batas Pambansa 340, which expropriated specified parcels of
 land located along F. Rein-Del Pan streets from Taft Avenue to Roxas 
Blvd. in the City of Pasay, states:



â
SEC. 4
. The just compensation for the 
expropriated properties shall be determined by the court based on their 
fair market value, after considering all the facts which make them 
commercially valuable.
  


âUpon the expropriation of said parcels of land, the Government 
shall deposit at the Philippine National Bank at its main office or any 
of its branches an amount as may be determined by the court, the 
Government or its authorized instrumentality, agency or entity 
shall
 be entitled to immediate possession and disposition of the property and
 improvements thereon including the power of demolition if necessary
.â
  




Hence, the writ of possession, which was properly issued, also gave 
the respondents the power of demolition in accordance with the 
aforecited provision.

Whether or not the evidence of guilt was strong should be left to
 the determination of the Ombudsman who took into account the evidence 
before him.
[14]
 It was 
discretionary upon him if he would rely mainly on the findings of fact 
of the investigating prosecutor in making a review of the latterâs 
report and recommendation.
[15]
 This Court will not interfere with the Ombudsmanâs exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers. 

In closing, it is apt to take heed of this Courtâs ruling in the case of 
Dr. Ramon Y. Alba v. The Honorable Deputy Ombudsman, Cesar Y. Nitorreda, et. al.
,
[16]
 wherein it was said that:



ââ¦ this Court has consistently refrained from interfering with the 
exercise by the Ombudsman of his constitutionally mandated investigatory
 and prosecutory powers. Otherwise stated, it is beyond the ambit of 
this Court to review the exercise of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or 
dismissing a complaint filed before it. Such initiative and independence
 are inherent in the Ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as the 
champion of the people and preserver of the integrity of the public 
service.â

, the Petition for the issuance of the Writ of Mandamus is hereby DISMISSED.

SO ORDERED

evidence presented by the complainant.
