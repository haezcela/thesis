BELLOSILLO, J.:


On 29 October 1974 Bernarda and Rosario Galan sold their 
agricultural land with an area of 2.3926 hectares situated in Basak, 
Compostela, Cebu, to spouses Antonio Leonardo Sr. and Josefa Galan for 
P2,000.00. More than a decade later, or on 30 October 1986, petitioner 
Aniceto QuiÃ±o filed aa complaint for redemption of the property against 
the vendees claiming that he had been instituted as tenant thereon by 
the Galans since 1951; consequently, he had the right to be notified in 
writing of the owners' intention to sell the property to enable him to 
exercise his right of preemption under Sec. 11 of RA No. 3844
[2]

 but that notwithstanding the Galans had not informed him of the sale. 
He claimed that he learned of the transaction only on 1 September 1986 
when he found out that the Leonardos were already the new owners. He 
therefore prayed that he be allowed to redeem the property and consigned
 the purchase price with the trial court on the same day he filed his 
complaint.

Meanwhile, on 4 November 1986 the Leonardos sold the property to private respondent Jose Bitoon for P30,000.00.

On 12 November 1986 petitioner filed another complaint against 
the same spouses for injunction with a prayer for a restraining order to
 enjoin his ejectment from the property.

During the pendency of the case, Antonio Leonardo Sr. died. His 
children, private respondents Purificacion L. Canson, Editha G. 
Leonardo, Carmelita L. Mori, Josefina L. Bais, Aida L. Collyer, Antonio 
G. Leonardo, Rudolfo G. Leonardo, Roberto G. Leonardo and Teresa L. 
Regner, were substituted in his stead as co-defendants. 

Sometime thereafter, petitioner received a letter from the 
counsel of respondent Bitoon dated 24 November 1986 notifying him of the
 transfer of ownership of the land to his client. As no supporting 
document was attached to the letter to bolster counsel's claim, 
petitioner went to the Notarial Division of the Capitol Building and 
obtained on 2 March 1987 a copy of the pertinent deed of sale between 
spouses Leonardo and respondent Bitoon.

On 27 July 1987 petitioner filed an amended complaint impleading 
Jose Bitoon as additional defendant. However, on 8 October 1990 the 
trial court dismissed the original as well as the amended complaint 
after finding that majority of the essential requisites of tenancy 
relationship between the parties did not exist.
[3]


The Court of Appeals however arrived at an entirely different evaluation of the evidence.
[4]

 On 5 August 1994 it held that all the essential requisites for tenancy 
relationship were present, and being a tenant petitioner was entitled to
 the rights of preemption and redemption under Secs. 11 and 12, 
respectively, of RA No. 3844. Nevertheless it noted a stumbling block to
 petitioner's complete victory thus -



Be that as it may, since the land in question had already pass(ed) 
on to defendant-appellee Jose Bitoon, and plaintiff-appellant's quests 
against defendant-appellees spouses Antonio Leonardo and Josefa Galan 
may be considered moot and academic under RA 3844, Section 10, 
defendant-appellee Jose Bitoon having been subrogated to the rights and 
obligations of his predecessors-in-interest, his obligation under the 
law to the tenant-plaintiff continues and subsists, that 
if he decides to sell the land, then plaintiff-appellant can still exercise his rights under the law
 (
Velasquez v. Nery
, 211 SCRA 28, 
underscoring supplied
).
[5]






The appellate court decreed thus - 



declaring petitioner as tenant of Bernarda and Rosario Galan and 
thereafter of their successor-in-interest, Antonio Leonardo Sr. 
substituted by his (nine?) children and in turn of the present owner, 
respondent Bitoon; 
ordering respondent Bitoon to reinstate petitioner as agricultural
 tenant and to maintain him in the peaceful possession and enjoyment of 
the land tenanted by him; 
ordering the Clerk of Court of the trial court to return to 
petitioner the amount of two thousand pesos (P2,000.00) which he 
consigned with the trial court as redemption price for the land in 
question, covered by O.R. No. 9802404 J dated 30 October 1986; and, 
no pronouncement as to costs.
[6]






On 23 November 1994 respondent Court of Appeals denied reconsideration.
[7]


The issue then is whether respondent Court of Appeals was correct
 in holding that petitioner could not redeem the property from 
respondent Bitoon unless the latter decided to sell it on the strength 
of the ruling in 
Velasquez v. Nery
.
[8]


Petitioner asserts that 
Velasquez
 is inapplicable 
because of the difference in factual circumstances. In that case, the 
sale made by the landowners to a third party was by virtue of a court 
order and not as envisioned under Sec. 11 of RA No. 3844. In other 
words, the right of the tenants therein to preemptively purchase was not
 violated. Hence the right of redemption was unavailing to them.

For a better understanding of the controversy, it is essential to
 discuss first the statutory right of redemption and pertinent 
jurisprudence on the matter. 

Section 12 of RA No. 3844 as amended by RA No. 6389 provides - 



Sec. 12. 
Lessee's right of Redemption
. - In case the 
landholding is sold to a third person without the knowledge of the 
agricultural lessee, the latter shall have the right to redeem the same 
at a reasonable price and consideration x x x x The right of redemption 
under this Section may be exercised within one hundred eighty days from 
notice in writing which shall be served by the vendee on all lessees 
affected and the Department of Agrarian Reform upon the registration of 
the sale x x x x The redemption price shall be the reasonable price of 
the land at the time of the sale x x x x 
  




Simply stated, in the event that the landholding is sold to a third 
person without the knowledge of the agricultural lessee, the latter is 
granted by law the right to redeem it within one hundred eighty (180) 
days from notice in writing and at a reasonable price and consideration.
 Petitioner was not notified of the first and second instances of sale 
of the property apparently because all the respondents disputed 
petitioner's assertion that he has been a tenant thereon since 1951. 
These instances of sale without notification gave rise to his right to 
redeem the property as lessee although no longer from the Leonardos but 
from its present owner, respondent Bitoon. 

A letter dated 24 November 1986 from the counsel of respondent 
Bitoon was received by petitioner informing him that the ownership of 
subject property has been transferred to respondent Bitoon. However the 
counsel did not bother to furnish petitioner with the supporting 
documents which is why petitioner did not readily believe what was 
written in the letter. Petitioner had to proceed to the Notarial 
Division of the Capitol Building on 2 March 1987 to secure a copy of the
 deed of sale between spouses Leonardo and respondent Bitoon. 

The purpose of the written notice required by law is to remove 
all uncertainties as to the sale, its terms and its validity, and to 
quiet any doubts that the alienation is not definitive. The law does not
 prescribe any particular form of notice, nor any distinctive method for
 notifying the redemptioner. So long as the redemptioner is informed in 
writing of the sale and the particulars thereof, the period for 
redemption will start running.
[9]

 The letter received by petitioner, being bare, was not such written 
notice. It failed to make certain the terms, particulars and validity of
 the sale. Rather, only a copy of the deed of sale, in an authentic 
form, will satisfy the requirement of the law and serve the purpose 
thereof. Thus, it is proper to reckon the period of redemption from 
receipt of the authentic document on 2 March 1987. The amended complaint
 filed on 27 July 1987 is well within the redemption period of one 
hundred eighty (180) days.

The preceding discussion leads us to the requirement concerning 
reasonable price and consideration. An offer to redeem to be properly 
effected can either be through a formal tender with consignation or by 
filing a complaint in court coupled with consignation of the redemption 
price within the prescribed period.
[10]

 It must be stressed however that in making a repurchase it is not 
sufficient that a person offering to redeem merely manifests his desire 
to repurchase; this statement of intention must be accompanied by an 
actual and simultaneous tender of payment which constitutes the legal 
use or exercise of the right to repurchase. And the tender of payment 
must be for the full amount of the repurchased price, otherwise the 
offer to redeem will be held ineffectual.
[11]

 As to what constitutes reasonable price and consideration, the 
valuation placed by the Leonardo spouses and respondent Bitoon 
themselves as price of the land must be taken to be such reasonable 
price and consideration.
[12]


Petitioner consigned the amount of P2000.00 paid by the Leonardos
 to the Galans. However when he amended his complaint by imp[leading 
respondent Bitoon, he did not increase the amount consigned as would 
have made it equivalent to P30,000.00, representing payment by the 
second vendee. In this regard, petitioner submits that he is not 
required to consign the latter amount since that would put an additional
 burden on a tenant seeking redemption. After all, he would be paying 
whatever amount would be finally determined by the trial court as 
reasonable price and consideration. 

It is not difficult to discern why the full amount of the 
redemption price should be consigned in court. Only by such means can 
the buyer become certain that the offer to redeem is one made seriously 
and in good faith. A buyer cannot be expected to entertain an offer of 
redemption without the attendant evidence that the redemptioner can, and
 is willing to accomplish the repurchase immediately. A different rule 
would leave the buyer open to harassment by speculators or crackpots, as
 well as to unnecessary prolongation of the redemption period, contrary 
to the policy of the law in fixing a definite term to avoid prolonged 
and anti-economic uncertainty as to ownership of the thing sold. 
Consignation of the entire price would remove all controversies as to 
the redemptioner's ability to pay at the proper time.
[13]

 Against such rationale, petitioner's submission is rendered 
insignificant. The amount so consigned by him falls short of the 
requirement of the law and leaves the Court with no choice but to rule 
against him. 

With the foregoing ratiocination, it becomes unnecessary to dwell
 on the issue of whether petitioner may redeem the property from 
respondent Bitoon. Nevertheless, we shall pursue the discussion thereon 
if only to rectify some points. In Velasquez, the Velasquez spouses, in a
 nutshell, were agricultural lessees of the property owned by the Nery 
spouses and the Lorenzos. Later, the owners filed an action for 
partition before the trial court. In a compromise agreement, they agreed
 to sell the property to Delta Motor Corporation. Having received 
information about the impending sale, the Velasquez spouses filed an 
action for redemption before the then Court of Agrarian Relations. 
Subsequently, the sale materialized. Unfortunately, the redemption case 
was dismissed due to lack of interest to redeem the property at its 
acquisition price. The appeal before respondent court and the petition 
before this Court met the same fate. However, we also noted that the 
Philippine National Bank (PNB), which was not a party to the case, had 
in the meantime extrajudicially foreclosed the property. By way of 
obiter dictum
 we stated-



Because of the extra-judicial foreclosure of the mortgage over the 
subject property by the Philippine National Bank, the present case has 
become moot and academic with regard to petitioners' claim against Delta
 Motor Corporation. It is now the PNB or its subsequent transferees from
 whom the petitioners must redeem, if and when PNB decides to sell or 
alienate the subject property in the future x x x x
  




Respondent appellate court must have taken out of context our 
statement therein when the former ruled that "if respondent Bitoon 
decides to sell the land then petitioner can still exercise his rights 
under the law." The phrase in the 
Velasquez
 case that "if and 
when PNB decides to sell or alienate the subject property in the future"
 logically refers to "its subsequent transferees" only, and not as a 
condition precedent to the exercise of the right of redemption as what 
respondent court perceived it to be. To further stress the matter, the 
ruling of respondent court overlooks the essence of redemption provided 
in the amended Sec. 12 of RA No. 3844 which, as previously mentioned, 
grants to the lessee such right in case the property is sold to a third 
person without his knowledge. Since that situation obtained in 
Velasquez
,
 the Velasquez spouses had the right to redeem the property from the PNB
 as new owner. The circumstance that the property was sold to a third 
person without the knowledge of the lessee provides the source from 
which the right of redemption springs. Analyzing this right, it may be 
stated that such right works only one way - in favor of the 
redemptioner. For he can compel the purchaser to sell but he cannot be 
compelled to buy. Supposing the lessee failed to redeem the property and
 the purchaser decided to sell or alienate it without notifying the 
former, the property may be redeemed from the subsequent transferee 
because another essence of the right of redemption is that it attaches 
to a particular landholding by operation of law.
[14]
 The plain import of the 
obiter dictum
 in the 
Velasquez

 case is that the Velasquez spouses may redeem the property from the PNB
 as new owner, or 
should PNB decide to sell the property they may redeem the same from its
 transferee. Thus, contrary to the assertion of petitioner, 
Velasquez

 is applicable but not as so applied by respondent court; instead, it 
should have based its main ruling on the lack of interest to redeem the 
property at the acquisition price paid by respondent Bitoon. 

Hence we reiterate that, for failure of petitioner to consign the
 entire redemption price, there was no valid exercise by him of his 
legal right to redeem.

WHEREFORE
, the petition is DENIED. The decision 
of respondent Court of Appeals (1) declaring petitioner as tenant of 
Bernarda and Rosario Galan and thereafter of their 
successor-in-interest, Antonio Leonardo Sr. and Josefa Galan, and in 
turn, of the present owner respondent Bitoon; (2) ordering respondent 
Jose Bitoon to reinstate petitioner as agricultural tenant and to 
maintain him in the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the land 
tenanted by him; (3) ordering the Clerk of Court of the trial court to 
return to petitioner the amount of P2,000.00 which he consigned as 
redemption price for the land in question covered by O.R. No. 9802404 J 
dated 30 October 1986, with no pronouncement as to costs, is AFFIRMED.
