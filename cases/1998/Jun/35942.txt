SEVERIANA GACHO, COMPLAINANT, VS. DIOSCORO A. FUENTES, JR. DEPUTY SHERIFF IV, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 20, CEBU CITY, RESPONDENT. 
D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


The instant administrative matter arose from a letter-complaint of 
Severiana Gacho dated February 4, 1997, addressed to the Honorable 
Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, charging Dioscoro 
A. Fuentes, Jr., Sheriff IV of Branch 20 of the Regional Trial Court of 
Cebu City, with grave dishonesty allegedly committed as follows: 
  


âSometime after I was awarded as a winning bidder of the 25 
[l]ots sold at public auction in Civil Case No. CEB-14498 entitled 
âFermina O. Consunji, et al vs. Leopolda Cecilioâ and on the execution 
of the Certificate of Sale on December 2, 1996 in my favor for  
P1,700,000.00, the aforenamed [s]heriff fraudulently demanded from me 
10% of the said amount or the sum of P170,000.00 as an alleged sheriffâs
 fee for which I issued Managerâs Check No. 006513 in the said amount, 
dated December 2, 1996; that for the said amount, I was not issued an 
official receipt and much less even [a] provisional receipt; that what 
is worst is the fact that said [s]heriff has been avoiding my presence; 
that I finally verified recently with the Office of the Clerk of Court 
as to the payment of the sheriffâs fee and there I found out that the 
sheriffâs fee for the value of P1,700,000.00 is only P34,080.00; that it
 was only after the discovery of his anomaly that subject sheriff paid 
the sheriffâs fee of P34,080.00 belatedly; and that subject sheriff had 
twice requested me for time within which to return the excess of
      P135,920.00 but had consistently failed to return the said excess 
even up to the present indicative of his misappropriation thereof.â
[1]
 




On February 17, 1997 complainant filed an affidavit of desistance,
[2]

 praying that the complaint be
        withdrawn since she had already received a managerâs check in 
the amount of P135,920 representing the excess of the sheriffâs fee, and
 that she
        had come to terms with respondent.



On March 11, 1997, Deputy Court Administrator Bernardo P. Abesamis 
(now a member of the Court of Appeals) indorsed the letter-complaint and
 the
        subsequent affidavit of desistance to Executive Judge Priscila 
S. Agana, RTC, Branch 24, Cebu City, for the purpose of determining if 
there
  still existed reasonable ground to proceed administratively against 
respondent sheriff.
[3]
 


In a second indorsement letter
[4]
addressed
 to Judge Galicano Arriesgado, Judge Agana stated that she
        could not act on the complaint with impartiality, because she 
had made a prejudgment thereon before it was referred to her by the 
Office of the
        Court Administrator. Hence, Judge Arriesgado himself conducted 
an inquiry. He subpoenaed the complainant and the respondent and advised
 them to
        bring witnesses and to obtain the assistance of counsel. In 
compliance therewith, Complainant Severina Gacho appeared with her 
counsel, Atty.
        Basilio E. Duaban, while Respondent Dioscoro Fuentes, Jr. was 
assisted by Atty. Oliveros Kintanar. Both parties gave their respective
  testimonies, which were summarized by Judge Arriesgado as follows: 




âDuring the clarificatory examination, Mrs. Severina Gacho, 78 
years old, widow, businesswoman and residing at Sabellano St., Pleasant
              Homes, Cebu City, declared that she had filed a sworn 
letter-complaint addressed to the Honorable Executive Judge, RTC, Cebu 
City dated
              February 4, 1997. She identified her signature on the 
letter-complaint. The letter complaint was filed because as a winner in 
the bidding
              for P1.7 [m]illion, she was made to pay 10% thereof as 
sheriffâs fee for P170,000.00 without any receipt as the payment was 
only through [a]
              managerâs check of Monte de Piedad with the sheriff, Jun 
Fuentes, as payee. The manager of the bank handed to the sheriff the 
managerâs
              check and the same was encashed by him. As he was not 
issued any receipt, she went to RTC Br. 20 where respondent sheriff is 
assigned. She
              went to Atty. Joaquino, the [c]lerk of [c]ourt, and she 
was told that the sheriffâs fee was not P170,000.00 but only P34,080.00.
 The amount
              of P135,920.00 was returned to her by Sheriff Fuentes. 
Confronted with the Affidavit of Desistance executed by her on February 
17, 1997, she
              declared that she was prompted to execute it as Mr. 
Fuentes pleaded to her that he would just pay the amount and she was 
asked to pity him
              because he ha[d] four (4) children and a wife. He might be
 ousted from his work. The amount was paid to her after the execution of
 her
              affidavit. With her execution of the affidavit, she had no
 more intention to pursue the case against him for as long as he would 
not do it
              again. She had executed the affidavit voluntarily, without
 being coerced or intimidated in any manner whatsoever. 


Respondent was presented as the only witness for himself. He 
declared that he [was] 43 years old, married and a resident of Talo-ot, 
Argao,
              Cebu and presently Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court, 
Branch 20, Cebu City. He was a deputy sheriff for about three (3) years.
 He [knew]
              Severiana Gacho, a lone bidder in a bidding conducted by 
him in a sale of execution. She was known to him for 3 months before the
 bidding.
              After the bidding, he informed Mrs. Gacho that being the 
highest bidder and not being a party to the case, she ha[d] to pay him 
the sum of
              P1,700,000.00 as her bid price and an amount corresponding
 to the payments due to the government and somebody close to her who 
were termed
              as âahente sa mga yutaâ, real estate brokers for the sum 
of P170,000.00 or ten percent (10%) of P1,700,000.00 because this would 
be the
              amount due the government. He issued to Mrs. Gacho a 
Certificate of Sale. 


It was further testified by respondent that the sum of 
P170,000.00 really went to the government. After deducting the amount of
 P34,800
[5]
 representing the 
government commission under Rule 141, Rules of Court, capital gains tax 
and
              documentary stamps were to be paid to the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue. Another amount was also to be paid to the Register of 
Deeds for the
              registration of the certificate of sale. He did not issue 
any receipt to complainant in the amount of P1,700.000.00 and the 
P170,000.00
              because there were 2 checks which she gave through the 
manager of the bank both in the name of respondent. He admitted that the
 amount
              actually payable [was] only P34,080.00 and not 
P170,000.00. The amount of P135,020.00 [was] an excess amount from 
P170,000.00 after
              deducting P34,080.00 paid to the Office of the Clerk of 
Court but it did not necessarily mean that the excess amount went to his
 pocket. He
              returned the P135,020.00 to her to pay the capital gains 
tax with the BIR and to pay the registration fees with the Register of 
Deeds.  


Mr. Fuentes also declared that he did not receive a formal 
complaint against him. He only received an Affidavit of Desistance 
executed by
              [C]omplainant Severiana Gacho. The execution of the 
affidavit of desistance was upon request of respondent who pleaded to 
her that he ha[d]
              4 children and a wife.


xxx                                                xxx                                    xxxâ




Concluding, on the basis of the foregoing, that âthe act complained
 of [was] an established matter,â Judge Arriesgado explained:    




âWith the declaration of the complainant and the admission of the
 respondent, the fact of the commission of the act complained of is an
                established matter. There is however an extenuating 
evidence adduced during the whole inquiry[:] the assertion of the 
respondent that
                although he received P170,000.00 and P34,080.00 was paid
 representing the government commission (sheriffâs fee) under Rule 141, 
Rules of
                Court, yet the sum of P135,920.00 was intended to pay 
capital gains tax, [and] documentary stamps to the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue and
                another sum to be paid to the Register of Deeds for the 
registration of the Certificate of Sale. Respondent claimed that nothing
 of such
                amount went to his pocket. Even assuming that what he 
declared [was] true, yet as a sheriff, it [was] not proper for him to 
receive any
      amount of money other than what is termed as sheriffâs fee for 
which proper receipt must [have been] issued therefor. He was not 
supposed to receive other sums of money as payments of capital gains 
tax, documentary stamp tax and registration of documents as this could 
be handled by the interested party, the complainant herself. A 
government employee must, like Caesarâs wife, appear not only upright, 
but above suspicion. A public office is a public trust.â
[6]
 




In a memorandum dated February 11, 1998 addressed to the Chief 
Justice, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) agreed with the 
findings of
          Investigating Judge Arriesgado and recommended that Deputy 
Sheriff Dioscoro A. Fuentes be dismissed from the service for grave 
dishonesty and
          grave misconduct.


The Court agrees with the OCA that the acts of respondent 
constitute grave dishonesty and grave misconduct, for which dismissal 
from the service
          is warranted.


In 
Flores v. Caniya
,
[7]

 the Court âemphasized time and again that the conduct and behavior of 
everyone
          connected with an office charged with the dispensation of 
justice, from the presiding judge to the sheriff and to the lowliest 
clerk should be
          circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. 
Respondent sheriff is a court employee. He is thus required to conduct 
himself with
          propriety and decorum. His actions must be beyond suspicion.â 
In this case, the Court finds that the respondent has failed to comply 
with the
          strict standards required of court employees.


The essential facts of this case are undisputed. The evidence shows
 that respondent demanded from complainant the amount of P170,000 as
          sheriffâs fees. He received that amount, but issued no 
official or provisional receipt therefor. Upon complainantâs inquiry at 
the Office of the
          Clerk of Court in the said branch, she learned that the 
correct amount of sheriffâs fee was only P34,080 and that said sum was 
still unpaid at
          the time. Respondent transmitted the amount of P34,080 only 
after complainant discovered the irregularity. Respondent had earlier 
claimed that
          the excess of P135,920 was for the payment of capital gains 
tax, documentary stamps and registration of the Certificate of Sale; but
 the amount
          was not used for the said purpose, and it was subsequently 
returned to the complainant.


Quite obviously, respondent improperly collected an excessive 
amount of money from complainant. In the first place, only the payment 
of
          sheriffâs fees can be lawfully received by him. Acceptance of 
any other amount is improper, even if it were to be applied for lawful 
purposes as
          herein alleged by respondent. As held in 
Tan v. Herras
,
[8]

 sheriffs cannot receive gratuities and
          voluntary payments from parties in the course of the 
performance of their duties. This is inimical to the best interest of 
the service, which
          would be tainted with suspicion.


Worse, respondent claimed that the excess was for the payment of 
tax and other registration fees. It is undisputed, however, that he did 
not
          tell the complainant 
at the time
 that the amount was 
to be used also for such purpose; instead, he misrepresented the entire 
amount of P170,000
          as sheriffâs fees. In the first place, it was not the duty of 
the sheriff to pay taxes and other sums to the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue (BIR)
          and the Register of Deeds. In the second place, he knew that 
the amount he collected as sheriffâs fees was excessive. This Court has 
held that
          any sum collected by a court employee in excess of the lawful 
fees allowed by the Rules of Court is an unlawful exaction which makes 
the
          respondent liable for grave misconduct and grave dishonesty.
[9]
 In 
AÃ±onuevo v. PempeÃ±a
,
[10]
 the Court held that â[i]t is an abhorrent and anomalous practice for a sheriff to demand fees in excess
    of those lawfully allowed.â 


Compounding his culpability, respondent did not issue any receipt 
for the amount he received in his official capacity, in violation of the
          General Auditing and Accounting Rules, which evidently 
signified his intent to misappropriate it.
[11]

 Furthermore, he did not remit the payment of the sheriffâs fees to the 
clerk of court; or the capital gains tax or registration fees to the BIR
          and the Register of Deeds, respectively.


Respondent failed to give a satisfactory justification for (1) 
collecting sheriffâs fees in excess of those prescribed by the Rules, 
(2)
          misrepresenting the purpose of the amount he demanded, (3) 
failing to issue a receipt for the amount he collected, and (4) not 
using the amount
          for the purported objectives.


Indubitably, respondent is administratively liable for grave 
dishonesty and grave misconduct in the discharge of his official duty. 
By his
          conduct, he violated the yardstick of public service imposed 
in Section 1, Article XI of our Constitution: a public office is a 
public trust;
          public officers and employees must serve with the highest 
degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency; and they 
must at all
          times remain accountable to the people.
[12]

 In addition, he displayed unprofessionalism in the discharge
          of his official duty, contrary to the mandate of the Code of 
Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees,
[13]
 
i.e.
, to perform and discharge their duty with the highest degree of excellence, professionalism,
          intelligence and skill, while endeavoring to discourage wrong perceptions of their role as dispensers of justice.


We agree with the OCA that the complainantâs desistance does not 
warrant the dismissal of the case. Administrative cases against public 
officers
          and employees are impressed with public interest, for they 
relate to a public office which is a public trust.

          [14]
 The grievance of the complainant against the 
respondent relates to his public duty and not to a purely personal 
matter; therefore,
          the matter transcends the complainantâs personal pique or 
pride. The need to maintain the faith and confidence of the people in 
the government,
          its agencies and its instrumentalities demands that 
proceedings in such cases should not be made to depend on the whims and 
caprices of the
          complainants who are, in a real sense, only witnesses therein.
[15]

 After this Court has taken cognizance
          of an administrative case, the complaint can no longer be 
withdrawn just because the complainant had changed his or her mind. In 
any event, this
          Court cannot be bound by the unilateral act of a complainant 
in a matter which involves its disciplinary authority over all employees
 of the
    judiciary.
[16]
 


The records indubitably establish respondentâs administrative 
liability. For such grave offenses prejudicial to the best interest of 
the
          service, respondent deserves the penalty of dismissal. As held
 by the Court in 
Punzalan-Santos v. Arquiza
:
[17]
    
 




âAt the grassroots of our judicial machinery, sheriffs and deputy
 sheriffs are indispensably in close contact with the litigants; hence,
                their conduct should be geared towards maintaining the 
prestige and integrity of the court, for the image of a court of justice
 is
                necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or 
otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the 
least and lowest of
                its personnel; hence, it becomes the imperative sacred 
duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good name and 
standing as a
                temple of justice. Respondentâs behavior erodes the 
faith and confidence of our people in the administration of justice. He 
no longer
      deserves to stay in service any longer.â
