PANGANIBAN, J.:


The Constitution mandates the state to afford full protection to 
labor. To achieve this goal, technical rules of procedure shall be 
liberally construed in favor of the working class in accordance with the
 demands of substantial justice.

The Case


This petition for review under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeks to set aside the Decision
[1]
 dated August 12, 1993, promulgated by the National Labor Relations Commission
[2]
 (NLRC) in NLRC NCR CC No. 000033-92, the dispositive portion of which reads:
[3]




âWHEREFORE, premises considered, respondent PNOC-subsidiaries are 
declared guilty of illegal dismissal, violation of the Memorandum of 
Agreement dated 3 January 1992 and of unfair labor practice acts, as 
herein charged. 


Consequently, respondent companies are hereby ordered to cease and 
desist from further violating the terms and conditions of the partiesâ 
Memorandum of Agreement of 3 January 1992 and from further committing 
the unfair labor practice acts herein complained of. 


Individual respondents herein are hereby ordered reinstated to 
their former positions with full backwages from the time of their 
dismissals to the dates of their actual reinstatements and without loss 
of seniority rights and benefits appurtenant thereto. In case 
reinstatement proves unenforceable on account of the sale of any of 
respondent companies, in lieu of reinstatement, the complainants 
concerned are hereby ordered paid their separation pay equivalent to 
their one (1) monthâs pay for every year of service, a fraction of at 
least six (6) months considered as one (1) whole year, in addition to 
the award of backwages. 


Respondents are hereby ordered to pay complainants their attorneyâs
 fees in the amount of not less than ten (10%) percent of the total 
monetary award herein. 


The claims of both parties herein for moral and exemplary damages 
and all other claims herein for lack of merit are hereby dismissed.â
  




Both parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration. Only
 the motion of herein private respondents was granted in a Decision
[4]
 of the NLRC dated December 9, 1994. The decretal part thereof reads:
[5]




âACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing, this Divisionâs Decision 
dated August 12, 1993 is hereby MODIFIED so that the PNOC-Dockyard and 
Engineering Corporation shall pay their employees separated because of 
the sale of their assets, separation benefits equivalent to two months 
for every year of service, as mandated by company policy and practice. 


The motions for reconsideration filed by Petron and its officers, 
PNOC-Dockyard and Shipping Corporations, PNOC Energy Development 
Corporation and Bataan Refiners Union of the Philippines are hereby 
DENIED for lack of merit.â
  




The present petition likewise impugns the foregoing ruling.

The Facts


The solicitor general exhaustively presents these factual antecedents of the case:
[6]




â1. On November 22, 1991, private respondent [Kapisanan ng Malayang
 Manggagawa-PNOC Dockyard & Engineering Corporation (KMM-PDEC)], 
among other unions namely: Bataan Refiners Union of the Philippines 
(BRUP); PNOC-Energy Development Employeesâ Association (PEDEA); 
PNOC-Coal Corporation Employeesâ Association (PCC-ELU); and 
PNOC-Shipping & Transport Corp. [Employeesâ Association] (PSTCEA), 
filed with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) a notice of 
strike against Phil. National Oil Company (PNOC) and Monico Jacob as 
President/Chairman, on the ground of discrimination constituting unfair 
labor practice (p. 2, NLRC Decision dated August 12, 1993). The dispute 
arose from the grant [by] petitioner and PNOC [of] the amount of 
P2,500.00 increase in monthly salaries to Managerial, Professionals and 
Technical Employees (MPT) but not to Non-Managerial, Professional and 
Technical Employees (NMPT). 


2. On December 13, 1991, Acting Secretary Nieves Confesor certified
 the dispute subject of the notice of strike to the National Labor 
Relations Commission (NLRC) for compulsory arbitration. The 
certification reads in part:
  




âxxx                 xxx                     xxx 


WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, and pursuant to Article 263 
(g) of the Labor Code, as amended, this Office hereby CERTIFIES the 
labor dispute at Phil. National Oil Company to the National Labor 
Relations Commission for compulsory arbitration.
    


Accordingly, any strike or lock-out is hereby strictly enjoined.
    


Parties are ordered to CEASE and DESIST from committing any and all acts that might exacerbate the situation.
    


SO ORDERED.
    


Manila, Philippines, 13 Dec. 1991.
    


SGD. NIEVES R. CONFESOR

        Acting Secretaryâ
    


(DOLE Order dated Dec. 13, 1991, Attachment 3, Position Paper, PNOC Subsidiaries)
    




3. The aforequoted Order however was not served to the respondent 
unionâs President, Felimon Paglinawan, who is authorized to receive 
notices. Wilfredo Rojo, the process server of DOLE merely left the Order
 with the guard on duty at the gate of the premises which is a distance 
away from the union office (pp. 10-11, Position Paper of respondent 
union, Records). 


4. In the morning of December 18, 1991, the day when respondent 
union was poised to strike, its officers and members decided to report 
for work but petitioner thru its Operations Manager, Nemesio Guillermo, 
padlocked the gate and refused entry to the employees. Some officers and
 members of respondent union were able to enter the premises of 
petitioner and punch-in their timecards; however, they were immediately 
escorted back outside (pp. 4, 12, & 13, Position Paper of respondent
 union and its Annexes âE-1â to âE-4â, Records; pp. 13-14, NLRC Decision
 dated Aug. 12, 1993). 


5. On December 19, 1991, Acting Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor issued a return to work order, which reads in part:
  




âxxx                 xxx                     xxx


WHEREFORE, ABOVE PREMISES CONSIDERED, all striking workers are 
hereby ordered to return to work within twenty four (24) hours from 
receipt of this Order and for the Company to accept them under the same 
terms and conditions prevailing prior to the work stoppage.
    


Further, the directive to the parties to cease and desist from 
committing any and all acts that might aggravate the situation is hereby
 reiterated.
    


SO ORDERED.
    


Manila, Philippines, 19 December 1991.
    


SGD. NIEVES CONFESOR

      Acting Secretaryâ
      


(Return to Work Order dated December 19, 1991, Attachment 4, Position Paper of PNOC Subsidiaries, Records)
    




6. On December 20, 1991, respondent union thru its President, 
Felimon Paglinawan filed before the NLRC Arbitration Branch, Region IV, a
 complaint against petitioner for Illegal Lock-out (Complaint dated 
December 20, 1991, Records).
  


7. On December 23, 1991, all members of the private respondent 
union reported and were accepted back to work (p. 5, NLRC Decision dated
 August 12, 1993).
  


8. Subsequently, petitioner filed before the DOLE a petition to 
declare the strike illegal with a motion to cite the striking workers in
 contempt for defying the DOLE Orders (p. 4, Position Paper of 
Petitioner, Records). Respondent union on the other hand filed a Motion 
to Dismiss the petition (p. 4, Position Paper for Respondent, Records).
  


9. On March 3, 1992, Felimon Paglinawan, Leo O. Orrica, Johnny 
Clariones and Generoso Mercado, Jr., the President, Secretary, Auditor 
and Treasurer of the respondent union, respectively, after due notice 
and investigation, were dismissed by petitioner from their employment on
 the ground, among others of their participation in the work stoppage on
 December 18 to 21, 1991 (p. 4, Position Paper of Respondent, Records).
  


10. On March 9, 1992, the aforementioned dismissed union officers 
filed before the NLRC a complaint for illegal dismissal. The cases were 
consolidated and in [the herein challenged] Decision dated August 12, 
1993, public respondent ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed 
officers of private respondent union x x x.â
  




The same Decision further ruled that, where reinstatement was no 
longer feasible âon account of the sale of any of respondent companies,â
 separation pay shall be awarded, equivalent to âone (1) monthâs pay for
 every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months considered
 as one (1) whole year, in addition to the award of backwages.â

The parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration. 
In its December 9, 1994 Decision, the NLRC modified its earlier 
disposition and ordered herein petitioner to pay its separated employees
 severance benefit equivalent to âtwo months for every year of serviceâ 
in accordance with the companyâs established business practice. The 
separate motions of PNOC and its subsidiaries were all denied.

Hence, this recourse
[7]
 filed by the PNOC Dockyard and Engineering Corporation.
[8]


Issues


Petitioner submits the following grounds for its petition:



âI. Respondent NLRC committed a grave abuse of discretion in not 
holding that KMM-PDEC and its officers are not guilty of illegal strike 
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, Rule XIII of the Omnibus 
Rules implementing the Labor Code and overwhelming evidence of their 
guilt. 


II. Respondent NLRC committed a grave abuse of discretion in not 
finding the termination of respondent KMM-PDEC union officers, who led 
the illegal strike, as legal and for just cause as clearly shown by 
overwhelming evidence.
  


III. Respondent NLRC committed a grave abuse of discretion in not finding that petitioner is entitled to the award of damages.â
[9]






The Courtâs Ruling 


The arguments of petitioner do not persuade us. We find no grave 
abuse of discretion committed by the NLRC in its two challenged 
Decisions.

First Issue:
    


The Strike Was Legal


At the outset, the Court emphasizes that, under Rule 65 of the 
Rules of Court, its review of decisions or resolutions of quasi-judicial
 bodies, such as the NLRC, is confined to issues of jurisdiction and 
grave abuse of discretion.
[10]

 As a rule, judicial review by this Court does not extend to a 
reevaluation of the factual circumstances of the case. Specialized 
agencies are presumed to have gained expertise on matters within their 
respective fields. Thus, their findings of fact, when supported by 
substantial evidence, are entitled to great respect and are generally 
rendered conclusive upon this Court,
[11]

 except only upon a clear showing of palpable error or arbitrary 
disregard of evidence. A thorough examination of the records of this 
case reveals no reason to justify a reversal of the factual findings of 
the NLRC.

In resolving that the strike was legal, the labor tribunal took 
note of the following facts: (1) the notice of strike was filed only 
after the union members lost hope for the redress of their grievance 
arising from their exclusion from the P2,500 salary increase; (2) the 
union members honestly believed that they were discriminated against, 
since the company practice in the past was to grant salary increases to 
all employees regardless of whether they were MPTs (managerial, 
professional, and technical employees) or NMPTs (non-managerial, 
professional, and technical employees); (3) such discriminatory grant 
appeared to be an unfair labor practice intended to discourage union 
membership, since MPTs were non-union members; and (4) the labor unions 
complied with the legal requirements before going on strike, such as the
 membersâ strike vote by secret ballot, the submission of the results 
thereof to the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB), the 
filing of a notice to strike and the observance of the 15-day 
cooling-off period. Respondent Commission opined that the unions had a 
reason to regard the salary discrimination, believed to discourage 
membership in the labororganization, as an unfair labor practice 
prohibited by Article 248 (e)
[12]
 of the Labor Code.

Thus, although rejecting that PNOC and its subsidiaries were 
guilty of discrimination, the NLRC reiterated the policy enunciated in 
several labor cases âthat a strike does not automatically carry the 
stigma of illegality even if no unfair labor practice were committed by 
the employer. It suffices if such a belief in good faith is entertained 
by labor as the inducing factor for staging a strike.â
[13]

 Indeed, the presumption of legality prevails even if the allegation of 
unfair labor practice is subsequently found to be untrue,
[14]
 provided that the union and its members believed in good faith in the truth of such averment.

As to the alleged violation of the strike prohibition in their 
CBA, the NLRC held that there should be no automatic verdict of 
illegality on the strike conducted. It found support from this Supreme 
Court ruling
[15]




âEven on the assumption that the illegality of the strike is 
predicated on its being a violation of the ban or prohibition of strikes
 in export-oriented industries, lack of notice to strike, and as a 
violation of the no-strike clause of the CBA, still, the automatic 
finding of the illegality of the strike finds no authoritative support 
in the light of the attendant circumstances. As this Court held in Cebu 
Portland Cement Co. vs. Cement Workers Union [25 SCRA 504], a strike 
staged by the workers, inspired by good faith, does not automatically 
make the same illegal. In Ferrer vs. Court of Industrial Relations [17 
SCRA 352], the belief of the strikers that the management was committing
 unfair labor practice was properly considered in declaring an otherwise
 premature strike, not unlawful, and in affirming the order of the Labor
 Court for the reinstatement without backwages of said employees.â
  




The NLRC noted further that the strike was peaceful and orderly, unmarred by any form of violence or untoward incident.

As to the alleged transgression by respondent unions of Section 
4, Rule XIII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, we agree 
with Respondent Commission that there actually was substantial 
compliance thereof. The aforesaid provision reads:



âSec. 4. 
Contents of notice
. - The notice shall state, 
among others, the names and addresses of the employer and the union 
involved, the nature of the industry to which the employer belongs, the 
number of union members and of the workers in the bargaining unit, and 
such other relevant data as may facilitate the settlement of the 
dispute, such as a brief statement or enumeration of all pending labor 
disputes involving the same parties. 


In cases of bargaining deadlocks, the notice shall, as far as 
practicable, further state the unresolved issues in the bargaining 
negotiations and be accompanied by the written proposals of the union, 
the counter-proposals of the employer and the proof of a request for 
conference to settle the differences. In cases of unfair labor 
practices, the notice shall, as far as practicable, state the acts 
complained of and the efforts taken to resolve the dispute amicably.
  


Any notice which does not conform with the requirements of this and
 the foregoing sections shall be deemed as not having been filed and the
 party concerned shall be so informed by the regional branch of the 
Board.â
  




Petitioner argues that the notice of strike was invalid, since (1) it
 erroneously named PNOC as the employer, which is actually a corporate 
entity separate and distinct from petitioner; (2) it did not indicate 
the specific acts which respondent union considered as unfair labor 
practices; and (3) there was no reasonable attempt or effort on the part
 of respondent union to amicably settle the alleged labor dispute.

The NLRC ruled, and we agree, that respondent union merely 
committed an honest mistake, because it appears on record that PNOC has 
the same set of corporate officers as petitioner;
[16]

 and matters as to wages and other official policies all emanated from 
PNOC, the mother company. The unrebutted testimony of Leo O. Orrica 
further attests to the fact that the employees concerned repeatedly 
brought to the attention of the management the discriminatory grant of 
salary increase, but the latter failed to address the grievance of the 
NMPTs or to satisfactorily explain such grant to MPTs only, except to 
say that it was managementâs prerogative.
[17]


Lastly, we agree with the solicitor general that, under the 
circumstances, there was sufficient indication of the nature and cause 
of the labor dispute subject of the notice of strike -- unfair labor 
practice in the form of discrimination. The unions merely filled out the
 standard form furnished for the purpose by the Department of Labor and 
Employment, and they were indeed not expected to write in detail the 
history of their dispute. By supplying the information required in the 
DOLE form and submitting the other explicitly required documents, 
respondent unions have substantially complied with the law.

A well-recognized norm in labor law is that technical rules of 
procedure are not to be strictly interpreted and applied in a manner 
that would defeat substantial justice or be unduly detrimental to the 
work force. Rules may be relaxed in order to give full meaning to the 
constitutional mandate of affording full protection to labor.
[18]

 As provided in Article 4 of the Labor Code, âall doubts in the 
implementation and interpretation of this Code, including its 
implementing rules and regulations shall be rendered in favor of labor.â
[19]


In addition, we disagree with petitionerâs contention that the 
strike became automatically illegal upon the labor secretaryâs 
certification of the dispute to the NLRC for compulsory arbitration. 
Basic is the rule that no order, decision or resolution -- not even one 
that is âimmediately executoryâ -- is binding and automatically 
executory unless and until the proper parties are duly notified thereof.
[20]

 The Labor Code specifically enjoins that decisions, orders or awards of
 the labor secretary, the regional director, the NLRC or the labor 
arbiter are âto [be] separately furnish[ed] immediately [to] the 
counsels of record 
and
 the parties x x x.â
[21]

 This means that in labor cases, both the party and its counsel must be 
duly served their separate copies of the order, decision or resolution; 
unlike in ordinary judicial proceedings where notice to counsel is 
deemed notice to the party.
[22]


Private respondents precisely impugn the validity of the service 
of the DOLE certification order dated December 13, 1991. They maintain 
that said order was not validly served on them, since their supposed 
copy was left only with a security guard at the gate of the office 
premises of the union. Allegedly, no effort was made to serve the same 
to an authorized person inside their office. The service of the order 
upon counsel for the umbrella union FUEL-GAS should not be deemed a 
valid service upon Respondent KMM-PDEC, which had its own counsel of 
record, Atty. Tomas Caspe, who appeared before the NCMB. Besides, the 
law requires service to both the counsel and the parties. It has also 
been previously held that service to a security guard of the building 
where the principal holds office is not a valid service.
[23]

 Nevertheless, upon verified information of the existence of the 
certification order, members of respondent labor unions promptly ended 
their strike and returned to their jobs.

All in all, we find that the conclusions of Respondent NLRC on 
the legality of the strike are in accordance with law and jurisprudence.
 Petitioner has failed to show grave abuse of discretion amounting to 
lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the NLRC.

Second Issue:
    


The Dismissals Were Illegal


Having ruled that the strike staged by respondent unions was 
legal, the subsequent dismissals of their officers due to their staging 
of said strike cannot be countenanced.

The NLRC correctly observed that, although petitioner averred 
that the dismissals of individual respondents were due to infractions of
 company rules and regulations, the alleged infractions actually arose 
from their participation in the strike. This is crystal clear from the 
charges leveled against the union officers, such as âactive 
participation in the illegal work stoppage,â âdisruption of company 
operations resulting [in] losses,â âviolation of the âNO STRIKEâ clause 
of the existing CBA,â among others, cited in their similarly worded 
notices of investigation that eventually led to their dismissals.

Furthermore, such investigations conducted by petitioner were in 
flagrant disregard of the authority and jurisdiction of Respondent 
Commission and in defiance of the Memorandum of Agreement
[24]

 with the striking unions, executed upon the order of then acting Labor 
Secretary Nieves R. Confesor. The issues relating to the strike and 
lockout were already submitted before the NLRC through the corresponding
 complaints filed by petitioner itself and private respondents. By 
filing a formal complaint for illegal strike, it behooved petitioner to 
desist from undertaking its own investigation on the same matter, 
concluding upon the illegality of the union activity and dismissing 
outright the union officers involved. The latter objected, in fact, to 
the conduct of such investigations precisely due to the pendency before 
the NLRC of an action based on the same grounds. Instead, petitioner 
preempted the NLRC from ascertaining the merits of the complaints. 

Moreover, the Memorandum of Agreement, other than enjoining the 
striking workers to return to work, likewise ordered the management to 
âaccept them under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to the
 work stoppage,â and ruled that the matter of âstaggeredâ wage and 
holiday pay deductions for the strike period be discussed in the 
labor-management committee (LMC). In glaring defiance, petitioner 
arbitrarily undertook to change the work schedule of some employees on 
the very day they resumed work, aside from deducting in full the wages 
and holiday pays of the striking employees pertaining to the strike 
period, even before the LMC could convene.

The actions of petitioner are clearly tainted with abuse of power
 and with illegality. While we recognize the prerogative of management 
to regulate all aspects of employment, the power to discipline and 
terminate an employeeâs services may not be exercised in a despotic or 
whimsical manner as to erode or render meaningless the constitutional 
guarantees of security of tenure and due process.
[25]


Time and again, we have held that the employment status of 
workers cannot be trifled with, such that their constitutional and 
statutory rights as well as those arising from valid agreements will, in
 effect, be defeated or circumvented. No less than the Constitution 
itself guarantees state protection of labor and assures workers of 
security of tenure in their employment.
[26]


Third Issue:
    


Damages


The actual and exemplary damages sought by petitioner have no 
basis in law, much less in equity and fair play. From the foregoing 
discussion, the strike was staged by respondent unions in the honest 
belief that petitioner, among the other PNOC subsidiaries involved, was 
guilty of unfair labor practice due to the discrimination in the grant 
of salary increase believed to discourage union membership, and to its 
refusal to bargain collectively on the matter. There was good faith on 
the part of the striking unions. Thus, they cannot be penalized by 
imposing upon them payment of damages.
