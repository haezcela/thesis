PANGANIBAN, J.:


Presidential Decree 1818 prohibits courts from issuing an 
injunction against any infrastructure project, such as the Cebu South 
Reclamation Project, âin order not to disrupt or hamper the pursuit of 
essential government projectsâ or frustrate âthe economic development 
effort of the nation.â This Court will not tolerate a violation of this 
prohibition.
    
  
Statement of the Case
 


Petitioners, through Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, assail the 
validity of three Orders of Judge Jose P. Burgos of the Regional Trial 
Court of Cebu.
[1]
 The first 
assailed Order, dated February 22, 1996, denied herein Petitioner Tomas 
R. OsmeÃ±aâs Omnibus Motion with Opposition to the Application for Writ 
of Preliminary Injunction, which prayed that said application be 
cancelled or its hearing deferred, and that the temporary restraining 
order already issued in favor of herein private respondent be lifted.
[2]
 


The respondent judgeâs previous voluntary inhibition was set aside 
by the second assailed Order dated March 12, 1996, which reads as 
follows:




âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the motion for reconsideration 
is granted and accordingly, the order of the Presiding Judge in 
voluntarily inhibiting himself from further sitting in the case dated 
February 26, 1996 is reconsidered and set aside. 


Set this case for another hearing on the application for 
preliminary injunction on March 15, 1996 at 10 oâclock in the morning 
whereby defendants are ordered to show cause if any they have why the 
injunction should not be granted. 


SO ORDERED.â
[3]
 




Meanwhile, the preliminary injunction sought by herein private 
respondent was granted by respondent judge who, in his third assailed 
Order dated March 18, 1996, ruled in this wise: 




âWHEREFORE, premises considered, and in order to preserve the 
status quo, upon the filing of an injunction bond with this Court in the
 amount of Two Million (P2,000,000.00) Pesos, let a writ of preliminary 
injunction be issued, hereby enjoining all the defendants, their 
assigns, agents and representatives or anyone acting for any or all of 
them or in their behalf from implementing the memorandum of agreement 
dated September 11, 1995, attached and marked as Annex âVâ in the 
original complaint dated January 18, 1996, except the construction of 
the Cebu South Coastal Road, and all other agreements/contracts of 
defendants concerning the Cebu South Reclamation Project tending to 
deprive plaintiff of its prior contractual rights in the said Cebu South
 Reclamation Project until further orders from this Court. 


The amount of the required bond shall answer for all damages that
 the defendants may sustain by reason of the injunction should the Court
 finally decide that plaintiff was not entitled thereto.          


SO ORDERED.â
[4]
 




The Facts
 


In their pleadings, the parties tried their best to give detailed 
accounts of the factual antecedents of this case. In fairness to them, 
the Court hereby reproduces in toto their respective narrations.        
  


Petitionersâ Version




âA. The Project
 


1. The Cebu South Reclamation Project (hereinafter referred to as
 the âPROJECTâ) is a FOUR BILLION PESO (P4,000,000,000.00) project of 
the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (hereinafter referred 
to as the âGOVERNMENTâ), funded out of a loan taken out by the 
government from the Government of Japan, through its international 
financing institution, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund 
(hereinafter referred to as the âOECFâ). 


2. The loan was made possible by virtue of an Exchange of Notes 
between the Governments of the Republic of the Philippines and Japan, 
whereby the latter extended a total loan package of ONE HUNDRED BILLION 
NINE HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR MILLION YEN (Y101,964,000,000.00) [sic] to 
finance certain specified and listed projects of the former. Among these
 projects to be financed by the loan is the Cebu South Reclamation 
Project. (Refer to Annex âEâ- Petition) 


3.        The project is an integral part of the Third Phase of 
the Metro Cebu Development Projects (hereinafter referred to as âMCDP 
IIIâ), which has been favorably endorsed and approved by the President 
of the Republic of the Philippines, Fidel V. Ramos, as âone of the 
projects of the national government.â (Refer to Annex âFâ- Petition) 


4.        The project has likewise been approved by the National 
Economic and Development Board (the âNEDAâ), of which the President is 
the Chairman, as an ICC Project, by virtue of NEDA Resolution No. 1, 
Series of 1995. (Refer to Annex âGâ- Petition) 


5.        The project is further certified as a project of the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines, by the Department of 
Foreign [Affairs], through its Secretary, Domingo E. Siazon. (Refer to 
Annex âHâ- Petition) 


6.        In due course, loan agreements in implementation of the
 Exchange of Notes between the two governments were executed between the
 OECF and [P]etitioner Land Bank of the Philippines (the âLANDBANKâ). 
Under these agreements, the City of Cebu was designated as the projectâs
 implementing agency. (Refer to Annex âIâ- Petition) 


7.        In accordance with the Constitution, the loan package 
to finance, among others, the Cebu South Reclamation Project, was 
granted final approval by the Monetary Board, by virtue of Resolution 
No. 1260 issued on 07 November 1995. (Refer to Annex âJâ- Petition) 


8.        The loan arrangements having been entered into, and the
 funds ready for release to the City of Cebu, the implementing agency of
 the project, the City of Cebu, the Department of Public Works and 
Highways (the âDPWHâ) and the Metro Cebu Development Project Office (the
 âMCDPOâ) executed, on 11 September 1995, the âImplementing Arrangement 
for Metro Cebu Development Project Phase III (MCDP III)â (Refer to Annex
 âKâ - Petition), under which agreement is outlined the procedure for 
implementation of the project as well as the rights and obligations of 
the parties thereto. 


B. The Suit Filed Below by Private Respondent
 


9. On 19 January 1996, [P]rivate [R]espondent Malayan Integrated 
Industries Corporation (hereinafter referred to as âMALAYANâ), filed a 
case for âSpecific Performance, Declaration of Nullity, Damages and 
Injunction, with Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Temporary 
Restraining Orderâ against herein petitioners, docketed as Civil Case 
No. CEB-18292, before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City. (Refer to 
Annex âLâ - Petition) The case was raffled to Branch 17 of the said 
court. 


10. Pursuant to Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 20-95, a
 summary hearing was conducted by respondent [j]udge to determine the 
propriety of issuing the temporary restraining order (TRO) prayed for by
 [R]espondent Malayan in its complaint. 


11. During the summary hearing to determine whether the temporary
 restraining order (TRO) should issue, defendants questioned the 
jurisdiction of the court to issue the same, citing Section 1 of 
Presidential Decree No. 1818, which provides: 




âSection 1. 
No court in the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order, preliminary injunction
, or preliminary mandatory injunction 
in any case
, dispute,or controversy 
involving an infrastructure project
,
 or a mining, fishery, forest, or other natural resource development 
project of the government, or any public utility operated by the 
government, including among others public utilities for the transport of
 the goods or commodities, stevedoring and arrastre contracts, 
to
 prohibit any person or persons, entity or government officials from 
proceeding with, or continuing the execution or implementation of any 
such project
, or the operation of such public utility, 
or pursuing any lawful activity necessary for such execution, implementation or operation
.â (Sec. 1, P.D. 1818; emphasis supplied) 




12. It was also pointed out to herein respondent [j]udge that the
 Supreme Court, in Administrative Circular 13-93, pursuant to P.D. 1818,
 and in implementation of the policy behind the law, prohibited all 
judges of all courts from issuing TROâs and/or writs of preliminary 
injunction against the implementation of government infrastructure 
projects. 


13. It was further manifested that the Supreme Court, observing 
non-compliance with the above-cited Circular by judges of trial courts 
was compelled to reiterate its earlier prohibition, with a warning 
against further violation, 
for their âstrict complianceâ
, under Administrative Circular No. 68-94, issued on 3 November 1994, which states:




â
There have been reports that
 despite Circular 13-93, dated March 5, 1993, 
some
 courts are still issuing temporary restraining orders and/or 
preliminary injunctions even in cases, disputes, or controversies 
involving government infrastructure projects
 in violation of Section 1 of P.D. 1818 x x x


âxxx                                                                                                xxx               xxx â 


In order to obviate complaints against the indiscriminate 
issuance of restraining orders and court injunctions against government 
public utilities and infrastructure projects in gross violation of the 
aforesaid Presidential Decree, the provision of 
Circular No. 13-93 issued on March 5, 1993 is hereby reiterated for your strict compliance.
 


âxxx         xxx      xxxâ (Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 68-94; emphasis supplied) 




14. In gross violation of the law and the circulars of the 
Honorable Supreme Court, however, respondent [j]udge issued a temporary 
restraining order on 5 February 1996, the dispositive portion of which 
reads as follows: 


âThe verified complaint being sufficient in form and substance 
and in order to preserve the status quo, all the defendants and their 
agents, employees, workers and all persons acting in their behalf are 
temporarily 
restrained from implementing the alleged memorandum 
of agreement dated September 11, 1995, and any and all such other 
agreements/contracts entered into by any and all of the defendants, 
covering the Cebu South Reclamation Project consisting of 330 hectares 
more or less
â (Refer to Annex âMâ - Petition) 


15. The hearing on [R]espondent Malayanâs application for the 
writ of preliminary injunction was set for 14 February 1996. During the 
said hearing, [P]etitioner Tomas R. OsmeÃ±a filed an Omnibus Motion for: 
(a) the immediate lifting of the Temporary Restraining Order; (b) the 
cancellation of the hearing on the application for the writ of 
preliminary injunction; and (c) the outright dismissal of the complaint.
 The Omnibus Motion was subsequently adopted by the defendants below. 
(Refer to Annex âNâ - Petition) 


16. The thrust of the Omnibus Motion was that the court below 
had, under P.D. 1818, no jurisdiction and no compelling reason to issue 
any TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction against the implementation
 of a government infrastructure project. Since it had no jurisdiction to
 issue such TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction, much less does it
 have the jurisdiction to entertain any application for the injunctive 
writ.                


17. The Omnibus Motion likewise refuted respondent [j]udgeâs 
arguments in its Order dated 5 February 1996 granting the TRO, wherein 
he attempted to remove the case from the ambit of P.D. 1818 thus: 




(a) the ruling in Genaro R. Reyes Construction, Inc. v. Court 
of Appeals, 234 SCRA 116 applies to the case at bar;                


(b) âplaintiff is not asking for enjoining the infrastructure 
project x x x [but] the enjoining of the contract to be awarded to 
another entityâ; 


(c) âinclusion of reclamation of submerged lands as being 
covered under the term âinfrastructure projectâ [is a] classification 
[that] has yet to be determined in the light of existing Presidential 
Proclamations, Orders and/or Executive Memorandums.â    




18. Respondent Judge -- apparently to verify whether the project 
was an infrastructure project of the national government -- required 
defendants below, petitioners herein, to show proof that the project had
 the approval of the President of the Republic of the Philippines.    


19. In compliance with the order of respondent [j]udge, 
petitioners, during the continuation of the hearing on the Omnibus 
Motion, set on 16 February 1996, presented the documents mentioned above
 (Refer to Annexes âDâ to âJâ - Petition), proving that the project had 
the favorable recommendation and approval, not only of the President, 
but likewise of the NEDA, and certified as a project of the Government 
of the Republic of the Philippines by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
 Insofar as the loan agreements were concerned, the Exchange of Notes 
(Annex âDâ) and the resolution of the Monetary Board (annex âJâ) 
approving the loan agreement were presented. All requirements for the 
implementation of a perfected contract are present and submitted to the 
court. 


20. Following the presentation of the foregoing documents, 
respondent [j]udge gave the parties five (5) days to submit their 
respective memoranda on the Omnibus Motion, after which the incident 
would be deemed submitted for resolution.                


21. On 21 February 1996, the parties filed their respective 
memoranda. As the memorandum for [R]espondent Malayan contained 
misstatements of the facts of the case, petitioner Tomas R. OsmeÃ±a filed
 a âReply to Plaintiffâs Memorandumâ at 9:00 oâclock in the morning of 
the following day, 22 February 1996. 


22. With unusual dispatch in a time frame of only a few hours, 
however, and under suspicious circumstances, in the afternoon of the 
same day, 22 February 1996, respondent [j]udge had issued an Order 
(Refer to Annex âAâ - Petition), a quite comprehensive five-page 
resolution denying petitionersâ Omnibus Motion, received by petitioners 
on 23 February 1996. 


23. Without having to consider the unusual haste with which the 
Order was issued -- considering that it was issued the day immediately 
after the last day for the filing of the memoranda, and on the day, and 
just hours after petitioner OsmeÃ±aâs âReply to Plaintiffâs Memorandumâ 
was filed, the Order dated 22 February 1996 was highly irregular for the
 most obvious reasons. 


24. A cursory review of the Order dated 22 February 1996 would 
reveal that it has practically decided the case on the merits, on a mere
 resolution of an incident in the main case. The Order denying the 
Omnibus Motion has practically ruled that: (a) [R]espondent Malayan has 
valid, existing and enforceable contracts of reclamation approved by the
 President of the Philippines; (b) petitionersâ reclamation project did 
not have the approval of the President; and (c) petitioners were 
violating [R]espondent Malayanâs contracts. 


These were precisely the issue[s] in the main case for specific performance. 




24.1 It would be relevant to mention that in so ruling, 
respondent Judge practically considered âevidenceâ which were 
non-existent in favor of [R]espondent Malayan, and suppressed the 
evidence presented by petitioners. 




25. [I]n view of the actions of respondent [j]udge, [P]etitioner 
OsmeÃ±a filed, on 23 February 1996, an Omnibus Motion, praying, among 
other things, for the voluntary inhibition of respondent [j]udge on the 
ground of partiality manifested by the Order of 22 February 1996, which 
practically decided the case on the merits in favor of [R]espondent 
Malayan, in a resolution of a mere incident in the case. 


26. In an Order dated 26 February 1996, respondent [j]udge voluntarily inhibited himself. (Refer to Annex âOâ - Petition) 


27. Respondent Malayan, however, filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the Order of voluntary inhibition, to which 
petitioner OsmeÃ±a filed an Opposition. 


28. In the meantime, petitioner OsmeÃ±a had filed a Motion for 
Reconsideration of the Order dated 22 February 1996 denying the Omnibus 
Motion, with the cautionary notice that it was not to be deemed as a 
waiver of their opposition to the motion for reconsideration filed by 
[R]espondent Malayan of respondent [j]udgeâs Order of voluntary 
inhibition. Instead, the said Motion for Reconsideration with Cautionary
 Notice was to be heard by the court to which the case was to be 
eventually re-raffled, and scheduled for hearing on 22 March 1996. 


29. On 12 March 1996, however, respondent [j]udge reversed 
himself and reconsidered his Order of voluntary inhibition dated 26 
February 1996, and set the hearing on [R]espondent Malayanâs application
 for the writ of preliminary injunction for 15 March 1996. (Refer to 
Annex âCâ - Petition) 


30. Since the Motion for Reconsideration with Cautionary Notice 
was still pending resolution (and the hearing thereon yet to be 
conducted on 22 March 1996), petitioner filed an Urgent Motion for 
Resetting of the hearing, considering that the Motion for 
Reconsideration with Cautionary Notice -- which questioned the courtâs 
jurisdiction to entertain the application for the writ of preliminary 
injunction -- was prejudicial to the hearing set for 15 March 1996, 
since it would determine whether or not such proceedings should continue
 or not. 


31. During the hearing on 15 March 1996, however, respondent [j]udge denied petitioner OsmeÃ±aâs Urgent Motion for Resetting. 


32. Again, with unusual dispatch, on 18 March 1996, respondent 
[j]udge issued two (2) Orders, one granting the writ of preliminary 
injunction prayed for by [R]espondent Malayan (Refer to Annex âBâ - 
Petition), and another one denying petitionerâs Motion for 
Reconsideration with Cautionary Notice -- 
both issued even 
before the hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration with Cautionary 
Notice which was yet scheduled for 22 March 1996.
 


33. Hence, this petition for certiorari, questioning: (a) the 
validity of the Orders of respondent [j]udge dated 22 February 1996 
claiming it had the jurisdiction to entertain and to issue a writ of 
preliminary injunction against petitionersâ government infrastructure 
project, and the Order of 18 March 1996, granting the writ of 
preliminary injunction; and (b) the validity of the Order of respondent 
[j]udge dated 12 March 1996, reconsidering his earlier Order of 
voluntary inhibition, there being no other plain, speedy and adequate 
remedy in the ordinary course of law.â

Private Respondentâs Version




âOn May 22, 1967, Proclamation No. 200-A was issued which 
reserved for national improvement purposes, a certain parcel of land of 
the [p]ublic [d]omain situated in the foreshore of the District of San 
Nicolas, Pardo, Cebu City and Tangkey, Talisay, Cebu. This area was 
transferred and relinquished by the President of the Philippines to the 
Province of Cebu in behalf of the [n]ational [g]overnment, subject to 
private rights, if any there be. Copy of said proclamation was attached 
as Annex â4â to respondentsâ Comment. 


On January 11, 1973, Presidential Decree No. 3-A was issued which
 decreed that the reclamation of land under water, whether foreshore or 
inland, throughout the Philippines belong to and are owned by and 
limited to the [n]ational [g]overnment or to any person authorized by it
 under a proper contract.                    


On October 14, 1977, pursuant to and in accordance with the 
above-said Proclamation No. 200-A and Sec. 1 of P.D. No. 3-A, the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cebu and the then Cebu Provincial Governor 
Eduardo R. Gullas granted, awarded and authorized private respondent to 
undertake the actual and physical reclamation and development works of 
the foreshore, submerged and offshore areas of Three Hundred Fifty (350)
 hectares, more or less, which is a portion of the approximate area of 
5,386,800 square meters or 438.6800 hectares, as described in 
Proclamation No. 200-A. Copy of said Award was attached as Annex â5â to 
the Comment of respondents. 


On October 31, 1977, a Contract of Reclamation and Development 
was entered into, signed and executed by and between the Province of 
Cebu, represented by then Governor Eduardo R. Gullas, and private 
respondent. Copy of said Contract was attached as Annex â6â to the 
Comment. 


The said Contract of Reclamation and Development dated October 
31, 1977 between Cebu Province and private respondent was authorized by 
Resolution No. 475 dated October 4, 1977 of the Sangguniang Bayan [sic] 
Panlalawigan of Cebu.                    


On September 15, 1978, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cebu and 
then Cebu Governor Eduardo R. Gullas considered and approved the request
 of private respondent dated August 25, 1978 that the reclamation area 
of 350 hectares, more or less be increased from 350 hectares to 625 
hectares, more or less. Copy of said resolution was attached as Annex 
â7â to respondentâs Comment. 


On October 7, 1978, the Second Supplemental Contract of 
Reclamation and Development between the Province of Cebu and private 
respondent was entered into, signed and execu[t]ed by and between the 
Province of Cebu and private respondent. Copy of said contract was 
attached as Annex â8â to the respondentsâ Comment. 


On January 15, 1979, a Contract of Reclamation and Port 
Development was entered into, executed and signed by and between private
 respondent and Amsterdam Ballast Dredging Corporation (BALLAST) in 
connection with and regarding the reclamation area of 625 hectares of 
the foreshore, submerged and offshore areas from Pasil, Cebu City, to 
Tangke, Talisay, Cebu to Kawit Island and then to Pasil, Cebu City. Copy
 of said contract was attached as Annex â9â to respondentsâ Comment. 


On February 7, 1979, a Memorandum dated February 7, 1979 
addressed to then President Marcos, was submitted by the Province of 
Cebu, represented and signed by then Governor Eduardo R. Gullas, and the
 City of Mandaue, represented and signed by then City Mayor Demetrio M. 
Cortes for final consideration and approval. Copy of said memorandum was
 attached as Annex â10â to respondentsâ Comment. 


When the Province of Cebu and the City of Mandaue submitted to 
the President the Cebu South Reclamation Project for approval per 
memorandum dated February 7, 1979, attached as Annex â10â to 
respondentsâ Comment, it was premised on the following consideration as 
stated in the first paragraph of said memo:




âIn our earnest desire to contribute our share to the program 
of Your Excellency and of our government on industrialization, 
industrial dispersal and regional development in the New Society, the 
Province of Cebu and the City of Mandaue have authorized, subject to 
your Excellencyâs reclamation of 625 and 360 hectares of foreshore and 
offshore lands in South Cebu from Pasil, Cebu City to Tangke, Talisay, 
Cebu by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 200-A, promulgated on 
May 22, 1967 (ANNEX âBâ), which gives the Province of Cebu the authority
 to administer these areas within the City of Cebu, and, in Mandaue 
City, from Subangdaku to the Cabahug Coastways, by virtue of Sec. 94 of 
Republic Act No. 5519, which vests ownership and possession of all 
foreshore lands and submerged lands of the public domain in the City of 
Mandaue (ANNEX âCâ), respectively, 
under contracts of Reclamation and Port Development with Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation
,
 hereto attached as Annexes âDâ and âEâ, which we believe offer the most
 advantageous terms for the Province of Cebu, and City of Mandaue and 
the [n]ational [g]overnment because not a single centavo will be spent 
by the government in return for its share in the reclaimed areas and the
 operation of the international and domestic port facilities thereof, 
not to mention the socio-economic impact that the projects will create 
in the Visayas and Mindanao.â (Emphasis ours) 




On August 13, 1979, the Cebu South Reclamation Project was 
presented by the Province of Cebu and Mandaue City, was considered and 
approved in principle by then President E. Marcos, as per Presidential 
Memorandum directive dated August 13, 1979 and a copy thereof is 
attached as Annex âQâ of the petition. Among the salient provisions of 
said presidential approval are:




âa. That within twelve (12) months after the issuance of 
[p]residential directive authorizing the Project, a detailed and 
integrated development plan on land use including technical, economic, 
marketing and financial feasibility studies be submitted to the 
President for approval, otherwise, project approval may be deemed 
automatically revoked; to enable the PEA to exercise its 
responsibilities as the representative of the [n]ational [g]overnment as
 landowner, the person or entity chosen by the contractor to undertake 
the detailed feasibility studies shall report directly to the PEA; 


x                                       x                                         x 


âd. That Cebu City and Mandaue City shall enter into contract 
with Public Estates Authority for the reclamation project pursuant to 
E.O. 525. The PEA is authorized to determine the terms and conditions 
necessary for the implementation of the aforecited conditions including 
specification of the sharing scheme and other requirements of government
 entities on the reclaimed areas. Furthermore, the PEA is authorized to 
review, modify, and approve all contracts entered into or arising out of
 the reclamation project consistent with existing government regulations
 and national interests considerations. Finally, consideration of equity
 requires that option rights of first refusal for a period as may be 
determined by PEA, shall be granted to private entities which have made 
initial investments on the project.â (Emphasis ours) 




In other words, herein private respondent was granted by said 
[p]residential directive option rights of first refusal to undertake the
 project because of the initial investments it made on the project.     
                   


On August 1, 1980, as provided in Presidential Memorandum 
directive dated August 13, 1979 to submit within twelve (12) months 
after the issuance of the said Presidential Memorandum directive the 
detailed feasibility study for approval and âto enable the PEA to 
exercise its responsibilities as the representative of the [n]ational 
[g]overnment as land owner, the person or entity chosen by the 
contractor to undertake the detailed feasibility studies shall report 
directly to the PEAâ, the Province of Cebu, the City of Mandaue, the 
City of Lapulapu and the Municipality of Cordova submitted said 
feasibility study to the President for approval, copy of which was 
attached as Annex â12â to respondentsâ Comment. 


The Province of Cebu and private respondent entered into, signed 
and executed a Confirmatory Agreement dated November 1979, by virtue of 
which the services of MALAYAN was contracted to undertake the 
preparation and making of the said Detailed and Integrated Development 
Plan on Land use, etc., of the Cebu South Reclamation Project at no cost
 to the Province of Cebu. Copy of said Confirmatory Agreement was 
attached as Annex â13â to the respondentsâ Comment. 


The said Confirmatory Agreement acknowledged that it was the 
private respondent which made initial investments in the Cebu South 
Reclamation Project and the entity granted the right of first refusal or
 option rights to undertake the project as follows: 




âWHEREAS, the Memorandum dated 13 August 1979 embodied the 
proviso that option rights of first refusal shall be granted to private 
entities who have made initial investments in the reclamation projects; 


WHEREAS, the MALAYAN INTEGRATED INDUSTRIES CORPORATION, which 
had made initial investments in the projects and had, as a matter of 
fact, been previously bound by a contract with the PROVINCE OF CEBU to 
undertake the reclamation project in South Cebu evidenced by Document 
No. 145; Page No. 30; Book No. VI; Series of 1977 before Notary Public 
Justino K. Hermosisima, by these presents have offered to undertake and 
prepare, for and in behalf of the PROVINCE OF CEBU, the detailed 
feasibility study for the reclamation of the areas in the Municipalities
 of Talisay and Cordova, Province of Cebu, in conjunction and 
coordination with the Cebu South and the Mandaue Reclamation Projects, 
and which offer had been accepted by the PROVINCE OF CEBU as the 
consequence of the Reclamation contract by and between the two entities 
similarly reconfirmed in a communication dated October 4, 1979;â    




On January 4, 1980, a Confirmatory Agreement was entered into, 
executed and signed by and between the City of Cebu, and private 
respondent in which they confirmed, affirmed, approved and agreed that 
the Cebu South Reclamation Project dated January 15, 1979 between 
MALAYAN and BALLAST which was approved by the Province of Cebu and City 
of Mandaue and were approved in principle by then President Ferdinand E.
 Marcos, that its corresponding plan on land use, including technical, 
economic, marketing and financial feasibility studies of the Project be 
undertaken by the aforesaid Local Goverment units concerned and to be 
submitted to the PEA and the President of the Philippines within twelve 
(12) months after the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum directive 
dated August 13, 1979, and in compliance with the above-said 
requirements, the City of Cebu hired, awarded, engaged and contracted 
the services of private respondent to undertake and prepare in behalf of
 the City of Cebu the detailed and integrated development plan on land 
use, etc., of the Project covering the reclamation area of 400 to 625 
hectares, more or less, without any single expense, funding and at no 
cost whatsoever to the City of Cebu. Copy of said Confirmatory 
Agreemen[t] was attached as Annex â14â to the respondentsâ Comment. 


Again, the City of Cebu recognized the option right or right of 
first refusal of private respondent to undertake the project as the 
entity [which] had made initial investments in the project as follows:




 âWHEREAS, the President also directed that option rights of 
first refusal shall be granted to private entities which have made 
initial investments in the reclamation projects; 


WHEREAS, the MALAYAN INTEGRATED INDUSTRIES CORPORATION, which 
has made initial investments on the project, and in fact, was previously
 contracted by the Province of Cebu by virtue of Proclamation No 200-A, 
P.D. No. 3-A and Executive Order No. 525 to undertake the reclamation 
project for and in the City of Cebu and the Municipality of Talisay, 
Province of Cebu, and prior to which MALAYAN INTEGRATED had already 
invested substantial sums of money, time and effort in preparatory 
activities on said reclamation projects, by these presents have offered 
to undertake the detailed and integrated development plan on land use, 
[including] feasibility studies as required by the President, and the 
CITY OF CEBU has accepted the said offer of MALAYAN INTEGRATED 
INDUSTRIES CORPORATION;â    




On January 24, 1980, the Public Estates Authority (PEA) and the 
City of Cebu entered into a Memorandum of Understanding which recognized
 the pre-emptive right of plaintiff to undertake the project as 
recognized in the Presidential directive dated August 13, 1979. 




â6. Pursuant to the Presidential Directive dated August 13, 
1979, to accord pre-emptive rights for the actual prosecution of the 
reclamation project to private entities which have made initial 
investments on the project:â    




Copy of said Memorandum of Understanding was attached as Annex â15â to respondentsâ Comment. 


On August 1, 1980, on the basis of the Confirmatory Agreement 
dated November 1979 between the Province of Cebu and private respondent 
and the Confirmatory Agreement dated January 4, 1980 between the City of
 Cebu and the City of Cebu have awarded, hired, engaged and contracted 
the services of private respondent to undertake and prepare, in behalf 
of the Province of Cebu and the City of Cebu without any single expense,
 funding and at no cost to said Province of Cebu and City of Cebu, the 
detailed and integrated development plan on land use, etc., of the Cebu 
South Reclamation Project, the Province of Cebu thru then Eduardo R. 
Gullas, the City of Cebu thru then City Mayor Florentino S. S. Solon, 
the city of Mandaue thru then City Mayor Demetrio M. Cortes, the City of
 Lapulapu thru then City Mayor Maximo V. Patalingjug, Jr., and the 
Municipality of Cordova, Cebu thru Municipal Mayor Celedonio B. Sitoy, 
filed and submitted on August 1, 1980 the corresponding Detailed and 
Integrated Development Plan on Land use, including technical, economic, 
marketing and financial feasibility studies of the Cebu South 
Reclamation Project for the final consideration and approval by the 
Public Estates Authority and the Office of the President and the 
President of the Philippines. Copy of said document was attached as 
Annex â12â to respondentsâ Comment. 


On August 12, 1980, private respondent, for and in behalf of the 
Province of Cebu, City of Cebu, City of Mandaue, City of Lapulapu, 
Municipality of Talisay, Municipality of Cordova, in relation to the 
above-said Memorandum dated August 1, 1980 as required, also filed and 
submitted to the Office of the President and the President of the 
Philippines thru the PEA the additional copies of the said complete 
Project Studies and the Detailed and Integrated Development Plan on Land
 Use, etc., of the Metro Cebu Reclamation and Development Project which 
includes the Cebu South Reclamation Project. Copy of said document was 
attached as Annex â16â to respondentsâ Comment. 


On September 29, 1980, on the basis of the aforesaid Memorandum 
dated August 1, 1980 the PEA, in its MEMO FOR THE PRESIDENT dated 
September 29, 1980 indorsed and recommended to the President the final 
consideration and approval of the Detailed and Integrated Development 
Plan on Land Use of the Cebu South Reclamation Project. Copy of said 
document was hereto attached as Annex â17â to the respondentsâ Comment. 


Since Septembe[r] 19, 1980, when the PEA approved the Metro Cebu 
Reclamation and Development Project covering the reclamation area of 
4,910 hectares, which include the Cebu South Reclamation Project 
covering 625 hectares, and its corresponding detailed and integrated 
development plan on land use, etc., as per MEMO FOR THE PRESIDENT dated 
September 29, 1980, the President of the Philippines has not yet 
approved the detailed and integrated development plan on land use, 
including technical, economic, marketing and financial feasibility 
studies of the said project.                        


On December 29, 1995, the Office of the President thru President 
Staff Director Vicente A. Galang, issued 1st Indorsement to the effect 
that the detailed and integrated development plan on land use of the 
project is still pending final consideration and approval by the 
[O]ffice of the President until now or at the present date. Copy of said
 resolution was attached as Annex â18â to the respondentsâ Comment. 


On January 12, 1996, the Office of the President thru 
Presidential Staff Director Vicente A. Galang, issued an official 
certification that the Cebu South Reclamation Proj[e]ct covering 360 
hectares, has already long been considered and approved by the Office of
 the President and the President of the Philippines as per Presidential 
Memorandum directive dated August 13, 1979 but its corresponding 
detailed and integrated development plan on land use, including 
technical, economic, marketing and financial feasibility studies of the 
project which was filed and submitted by the Province of Cebu, City of 
Cebu, City of Mandaue, City of Lapulapu and Municipality of Cordova with
 the PEA and the Office of the President on August 1, 1980 per 
Memorandum dated August 1, 1980 and approved by the PEA in favor of the 
above-mentioned Local Government units concerned per MEMO FOR THE 
PRESIDENT dated September 29, 1980, is still pending final consideration
 and approval by the Office of the President. Copy of said certification
 was attached as Annex â19â to respondentsâ Comment. 


When the Province of Cebu and the City of Mandaue submitted to 
the President the Cebu South Reclamation Project for approval per 
memorandum dated February 7, 1979, it was premised on the following 
consideration as stated in the first paragraph of said memo: 




âIn our earnest desire to contribute our share to the program 
of Your Excellency and of our government on industrialization, 
industrial dispersal and regional development in the New Society, the 
Province of Cebu and the City of Mandaue have authorized, subject to 
your Excellencyâs approval, pursuant to PD 3-A (ANNEX âAâ), the 
reclamation of 625 and 360 hectares of foreshore and offshore lands in 
South Cebu from Pasil, Cebu City to Tangke, Talisay, Cebu by virtue of 
Presidential Proclamation No. 200-A, promulgated on May 22, 1967 (ANNEX 
âBâ), which gives the province of Cebu the authority to administer these
 areas within the City of Cebu, and, in Mandaue City, from Subangdaku to
 the Cabahug Coastways, by virtue of Sec. 94 of Republic Act No. 5519, 
which vests ownership and possession of all foreshore lands and 
submerged lands of the public domain in the City of Mandaue (ANNEX âCâ),
 respectively, 
under contracts of Reclamation and Port Development with Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation
,
 hereto attached as Annexes âDâ and âEâ, which we believe offer the most
 advantageous terms for the Province of Cebu, and City of Mandaue and 
the National Government because not a single centavo will be spent by 
the government in return for its share in the reclaimed areas and the 
operation of the international and domestic port facilities thereof, not
 to mention the socio-economic impact that the projects will create in 
the Visayas and Mindanao.â (Emphasis ours) 




This was so because under Executive Order No. 525 dated February 
14, 1979, all reclamation projects are subject to approval by the 
President. After the reclamation project is approved by the President, 
the project shall be undertaken by the Public Estates Authority (PEA) or
 through a proper contract executed by the PEA with any person or 
entity. This is so provided in Section 1 of said Executive Order which 
reads as follows: 




âSECTION 1 - The Public Estates Authority (PEA) shall be 
primarily responsible for integrating, directing, and coordinating all 
reclamation projects for and on behalf of the National Government. All 
reclamation projects shall be approved by the President upon 
recommendation of the PEA, and shall be undertaken by the PEA or through
 a proper contract executed by it with any person or entity; provided, 
that, reclamation projects of any National Government agency or entity 
authorized under its Charter shall be undertaken in consultation with 
the PEA upon approval of the President.â    




In other words, the President does not approve reclamation contracts but approves only the reclamation project.    


The President approved in principle the Cebu South Reclamation 
Project on August 13, 1979 as shown by Exhibit âA-13â. The approval was 
in principle only pending submission and presidential approval of a 
detailed and integrated feasibility study on the land use of said 
project. What is unique in said presidential approval was that it 
recognized the reclamation contracts earlier entered into by plaintiff 
with the Province of Cebu and the City of Mandaue by giving plaintiff 
option rights of first refusal to undertake the project, when said 
presidential memorandum stated:




â x                                         x                                               x       x 


Finally, considerations of equity requires that option rights 
of first refusal for a period as may be determined by PEA, shall be 
granted to private entities which have made initial investments on the 
project.â    




The presidential memorandum also directed the PEA, City of Cebu 
and the City of Mandaue to enter into contracts with the PEA for the 
Cebu South Reclamation Project and the Mandaue Reclamation project, 
respectively.    


Conformably, with said presidential directive, the PEA and the 
City of Cebu entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to 
the Cebu South Reclamation project wherein paragraph 6 of its Section 
II, it [sic] provided that the City of Cebu was obliged âto accord 
pre-emptive rights for the actual prosecution of the reclamation project
 to private entities which have made initial investments on the 
projectâ, which entity is no other than herein plaintiff. This option of
 first refusal or pre-emptive rights of plaintiff to undertake the 
actual prosecution of the project has never been cancelled, or 
rescinded. 


The herein private respondent filed this case for injunction when
 the respondents issued an invitation to bidders, Exhibit âA-21â 
particularly section 3.2 thereof which provides âfor the conduct of 
tenders and subsequent evaluation of bidsâ for the Cebu South 
Reclamation Project. In other words, the petitioners were going to 
entertain bids from private contractors for the undertaking of the Cebu 
South Reclamation Project in violation of the preemptive rights or right
 of first refusal of private respondent to prosecute the project.â
[6]
 




In a Resolution dated March 27, 1997, the Court granted 
petitionersâ prayer and issued a temporary restraining order enjoining 
the trial judge from enforcing the assailed orders and from conducting 
further proceedings in this case.
[7]
 


The Issues
 


In their Memorandum dated July 30, 1997, petitioners summarized the issues as follows:
[8]
 




âI 


Whether or not respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in 
issuing the orders dated 22 February 1996 and 18 March 1996, in 
contumacious violation of Presidential Decree No. 1818, and Supreme 
Court Administrative Circulars Nos. 13-93 and 68-94.                    
      


II                          


Whether or not, in grave abuse of discretion, the order dated 22 
February 1996 and the order granting the writ of preliminary injunction 
had the effect of practically deciding the case on the merits.          
                


III                          


Whether or not respondent judge acted with grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in granting the 
writ of preliminary injunction, as the applicant, [R]espondent Malayan, 
had no clear and unmistakable right to be protected by the injunctive 
writ.                          


IV                            


Respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in not dismissing 
the complaint outright, the alleged cause of action being admittedly 
premature, and a mere expectancy, or having otherwise been barred by 
prescription and/or 
laches
. 


V                          


Whether respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing
 the order dated 12 March 1996, reconsidering his earlier order of 
voluntary inhibition, there being strong grounds -- as respondent judge 
himself admits -- for his voluntary inhibition.                         
 


VI                          


Whether or not, as claimed by private respondent, the omnibus 
motion to dismiss filed below by petitioners was a mere scrap of paper. 


VII                          


Whether or not, as claimed by private respondent, a motion for 
reconsideration was necessary before the filing of the present 
petition.â    




The first, second, third and fourth issues are closely related and will be discussed together.    


The Courtâs Ruling 


The petition is meritorious.                          


First Issue:


Preliminary Injunction Void and Improper
 


Section 1 of PD 1818 distinctly provides that â[n]o court in the 
Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order, 
preliminary injunction, or preliminary mandatory injunction in any case,
 dispute, or controversy involving an infrastructure project x x x of 
the government, x x x to prohibit any person or persons, entity or 
government official from proceeding with, or continuing the execution or
 implementation of any such project, x x x or pursuing any lawful 
activity necessary for such execution, implementation or operation.â
[9]

 At the risk of being repetitious, we stress that the foregoing 
statutory provision expressly deprives courts of jurisdiction to issue 
injunctive writs against the implementation or execution of an 
infrastructure project.
[10]
 


In the case at bar, the assailed March 18, 1996 Order of respondent
 judge specifically enjoined petitioners from implementing their 
Memorandum of Agreement dated September 11, 1995
[11]

 (except as to the Cebu South Coastal Road), which pertains to the 
implementation of the Metro Cebu Development Project, Phase III, a major
 component of which is the Cebu South Reclamation Project. The 
petitioners were also enjoined from acting on or implementing all other 
contracts involving the said reclamation project. The issuance of said 
writ of preliminary injunction evidently constitutes a blatant violation
 of PD 1818. The assailed Order is therefore void for being issued with 
grave abuse of discretion and without jurisdiction. On this ground 
alone, the Court may already grant the petition. Nonetheless, we will 
proceed to discuss the other issues raised.                          


Reclamation Is an
                          Infrastructure Project
 


Private respondent claims that the Cebu South Reclamation Project is not an infrastructure project.
[12]
 This is erroneous and misleading. In 
Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation vs. Court of Appeals
,
[13]

 the Court unequivocally held that âthe reclamation of foreshore and 
submerged lands along the coast of Mandaue City up to the Cebu City 
boundary for the purpose of developing the reclaimed area into an 
industrial and trading center with a modern harbor and port facilities 
for both domestic and international commerceâ is an 
infrastructure project
 as contemplated under PD 1818.
[14]

 Private respondent should know this not only because everyone is 
presumed to know the law, but also because it was a principal party in 
that case.                          


Cebu South Reclamation Project
    

  Approved by the President


Private respondent further contends that, in spite of the 
prohibition in PD 1818, the questioned injunctive writ may still validly
 issue against petitioners, because the latter have not sufficiently 
shown that (1) â[t]he City of Cebu has a contract with the Public 
Estates Authority (PEA) to undertake the Cebu South Reclamation Project 
under P.D. 3-A,â (2) â[t]he PEA has favorably endorsed the Cebu South 
Reclamation Project for approval by the President pursuant to Executive 
Order No. 525,â and (3) â[t]he President has approved the Cebu South 
Reclamation Project pursuant to P.D. 525.â
[15]
 The Court is not persuaded.                          


In the August 13, 1979
[16]

 Memorandum on the Cebu South and Mandaue Reclamation Project, the 
President of the Philippines addressed this clear statement to the city 
mayors of Cebu and Mandaue, the chairman of the PEA and others 
concerned: âPursuant to P.D. 3-A and E.O. 525, and upon recommendation 
of the Public Estates Authority (PEA), the reclamation project covering 
985 ha.[,] more or less, of Cebu South and Mandaue foreshore areas is 
hereby approved in principle; and the City of Cebu and the City of 
Mandaue are hereby authorized to undertake the reclamation of subject 
areas x x x.â
[17]
 Furthermore, even the certification from the Office of the President dated January 12, 1996,
[18]

 presented in evidence by respondent itself, certifies that the Cebu 
South (and Mandaue) Reclamation Project âhas been previously considered 
and approved by the Office of the President and by the President of the 
Philippines, then His Excellency President Ferdinand E. Marcos, in favor
 of the Province of Cebu, City of Cebu, City of Mandaue, the Public 
Estates Authority and others concerned as the proponents x x x.â
[19]
 The approved reclamation project is distinct from the reclamation contract itself.                          


Private Respondent Has No Vested
    

  Right Violated by a Public Bidding
 


Private respondent argues that PD 1818 cannot be invoked to stop 
the issuance of a preliminary injunction in this case, as the acts of 
petitioners are tantamount to a violation of its vested rights. It 
claims â x x x a right to seek judicial intervention and relief when 
petitioners violated its right of first refusal by issuing invitations 
to bid the project to other contractors, without affording private 
respondent its right of first refusal.â
[20]
 We disagree.                          


Undisputed is the fact that the private respondent and the 
government have not entered into any validly approved and effective 
reclamation contract covering the Cebu South Reclamation Project. The 
City of Cebu and private respondentâs Contract of Reclamation dated 
October 31, 1977
[21]
 was never
 approved by the President. Their Confirmatory Agreement dated January 
4, 1980 merely shows that the City of Cebu engaged private respondent 
âto undertake and prepare the detailed and integrated development plan 
on land use, including technical, economic, marketing and financial 
feasibility studies x x xâ of the Cebu South Reclamation Project.
[22]

 Incidentally, the aforementioned certification, issued by the Office of
 the President on January 12, 1996, manifests that private respondentâs 
development plan and feasibility studies, submitted pursuant to the said
 Confirmatory Agreement, are the items pending final consideration and 
approval of the President.                          


Private respondent alleges that the injunctive writ merely 
protected its alleged right of first refusal which arose from the 
Presidentâs August 13, 1979 Memorandum addressed to the concerned public
 officials, stating that âconsiderations of equity [require] that option
 rights of first refusal for a period as may be determined by the PEA 
shall be granted to private entities which have made initial investments
 on the project.â
[23]
 This memorandum, however, must be construed in harmony with the aforecited PD 1818 and PD 1594,
[24]

 which prescribed the policies, guidelines, rules and regulations for 
government infrastructure contracts. Said memorandum certainly could not
 be construed as a law authorizing a repeal of PD 1818 and PD 1594. 
Indeed, laws are repealed only by subsequent ones,
[25]

 whether expressly or impliedly. There is no express repeal of said 
laws, as they were not even mentioned in the memorandum, either by 
number or by text. Neither can there be an implied repeal, since it was 
not âconvincingly and unambiguously demonstratedâ that the mention in 
the memorandum of a right of first refusal was so repugnant and 
inconsistent with said laws as to defy harmonization. Basic is the rule 
in statutory construction that implied repeals are not favored.
[26]

 In addition, the memorandum was merely an expression of an executive 
directive to subordinates, not a legislative enactment. Hence, it cannot
 obviate the operation of PD 1818 and PD 1594. Section 4 of PD 1594 
provides: 




âSEC. 4. 
Bidding
. -- Construction projects shall 
generally be undertaken by contract after competitive public bidding. 
Projects may be undertaken by administration or force account or by 
negotiated contract only in exceptional cases where time is of the 
essence, or where there is lack of qualified bidders or contractors, or 
where there is a conclusive evidence that greater economy and efficiency
 would be achieved through this arrangement, and in accordance with 
provision of laws and acts on the matter, subject to the approval of the
 Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communications, the 
Minister of Public Highways, or the Minister of Energy, as the case may 
be, if the project cost is less than P1 Million, and of the President of
 the Philippines, upon the recommendation of the Minister, if the 
project cost is P1 Million or more.â    




In the award of government contracts, the law requires a 
competitive public bidding. This is reasonable because â[a] competitive 
public bidding aims to protect the public interest by giving the public 
the best possible advantages thru open competition. It is a mechanism 
that enables the government agency to avoid or preclude anomalies in the
 execution of public contracts.â
[27]

 Lawful and laudable, therefore, is the petitionersâ Memorandum of 
Agreement mandating the City of Cebu to conduct a competitive public 
bidding in implementing the Cebu South Reclamation Project. The conduct 
of such public bidding is not violative of private respondentâs alleged 
vested right. In the Courtâs viewpoint, the said right may be considered
 for the purpose of awarding the contract of reclamation, only when the 
latterâs proposal are in all aspects equal to the bid of another 
proponent. In this kind of situation, the private respondentâs claim to a
 right of first refusal indeed entitles it to priority in the award of 
the contract. But this claimed right of first refusal cannot bar another
 proponent from submitting a bid or proposal.                          


Note, however, that under Section 4 of PD 1594, a negotiated 
contract may be allowed in exceptional circumstances enumerated therein,
 subject to approval by the President. Executive Order No. 380,
[28]

 which took effect November 27, 1989, also provided for the Presidentâs 
approval of negotiated infrastructure contracts, the cost of which, for 
the Department of Transportation and Communications, amounts to P100 
million and, for other departments and government corporations, P50 
million. Since the project cost of the Cebu South Reclamation Project is
 over 4 billion pesos,
[29]
 it 
is ineluctable that the Presidentâs approval is required. Consequently 
untenable is private respondentâs contention that its right of first 
refusal 
ipso facto
 entitles it to a contract of reclamation, 
because it fails to take into consideration the legal requirement that 
negotiated infrastructure contracts with costs beyond the specified 
ceiling must be approved by the President. Private respondent has no 
legal basis to claim that, because of its initial expenses in preparing 
its proposed plans and feasibility studies, it could dispense with or, 
worse, arrogate unto itself the Presidentâs power to ultimately decide 
or approve a contract of reclamation. In 
Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation vs. Court of Appeals
,
[30]

 the Court recognized the Presidentâs authority to disapprove the 
reclamation contract proposed by private respondent despite the latterâs
 initial investments; in that case, the President approved, instead, the
 contract between the City of Mandaue and F.F. Cruz, Inc. et al.
[31]
 


Issuance of Writ of Preliminary
                          Injunction Unjustified
 


From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the respondent 
judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing the Writ of Preliminary 
Injunction. Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, enumerates the 
grounds for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Although private 
respondent alleged these grounds,
[32]
 respondent judge had the duty to take judicial notice
[33]

 of PD 1818 and PD 1594. These laws, based on the foregoing discussion, 
ineludibly show that private respondent had no right to the relief it 
sought. It is well-settled that, âbefore a writ of preliminary 
injunction may be issued, there must be a clear showing by the complaint
 that there exists a right to be protected, and that the acts against 
which the writ is to be directed are violative of the said right.â
[34]

 In hindsight, the respondent judgeâs grant of the writ is truly 
regrettable, as it unnecessarily delayed the implementation of an 
important infrastructure project, a delay which had far-reaching 
consequences on the economic development and interest of Cebu, as well 
as the nation.                          


Second Issue:
    


Respondent Judgeâs Voluntary Inhibition
 


Petitioners
[35]
 contend that the respondent judge gravely abused his discretion, when he made a 
volte face
 on his previous Order dated February 26, 1996
[36]

 inhibiting himself from hearing the case. In issuing said Order, Judge 
Burgos noted that Petitioner Tomas OsmeÃ±aâs Motion for Inhibition raised
 the ground of âprejudgmentâ on the basis of statements made in his 
Order dated February 22, 1996. Judge Burgos disposed as follows:




âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the motion is granted, and 
accordingly, in order to disabuse the mind of the movant and to further 
faithfully serve the cause of justice, the Presiding Judge of this Court
 hereby voluntarily inhibits himself from further sitting in the present
 case with instruction to the Branch Clerk of Court to send the records 
to the Office of the Clerk of Court for approval by the Honorable 
Executive Judge Priscila S. Agana for final re-raffling. 


The scheduled hearing for February 26, 1996 is cancelled.                          


SO ORDERED.â
[37]
 




However, respondent judge reversed his voluntary inhibition,
[38]

 meekly stating in his Order dated March 12, 1996 that â[t]he allegation
 of prejudgment and partiality is so bare and empty as movant OsmeÃ±a 
failed to present sufficient ground or proof for the Presiding Judge to 
disqualify himself. The Judge realized the mistake in granting the 
motion for inhibition when defendant OsmeÃ±a misled the Court in 
asserting that on the same day February 26, 1996, he would be filing an 
administrative case against the Judge for violation of PD 1818 and 
Supreme Court Circulars issued in relation to said decree x x x. In that
 eventuality, OsmeÃ±a said, the Judge would be bias[ed] and partial to 
him because he [was] the complainant in the pending administrative 
case.â
[39]
 


We find merit in petitionersâ contention. Judge Burgos inhibited 
himself on the basis of Petitioner OsmeÃ±aâs allegation of prejudgment. 
In reversing his voluntary inhibition, respondent judge nebulously 
branded OsmeÃ±aâs allegations as âso bare and empty.â Judge Burgosâ claim
 that he was misled by OsmeÃ±aâs threat of an administrative case is 
obviously a mere afterthought that does not inspire belief. Although 
inhibition is truly discretionary
[40]

 on the part of the judge, the flimsy reasons proffered above are 
insufficient to justify reversal of his previous voluntary inhibition. 
As aptly pointed out by petitioners in their Memorandum, 




ââ xxx a judge may not rescind his action and reassume jurisdiction where good cause exists for the disqualification. 
Furthermore,
 because a presumption arises, by reason of the judgeâs prior order of 
disqualification, of the existence of the factual reason for such 
disqualification
, where the regular judge who has been 
disqualified revokes the order of disqualification, and objection is 
made to such revocation, 
it is not sufficient for the judge to 
enter an order merely saying that he or she is not disqualified; the 
record should clearly reveal the facts upon which the revocation is made
.â (46 Am Jur 2d Â§ 234, p. 321)â
[41]
 




We deem it important to point out that a judge must preserve the 
trust and faith reposed in him by the parties as an impartial and 
objective administrator of justice. When he exhibits actions that give 
rise, fairly or unfairly, to perceptions of bias, such faith and 
confidence are eroded, and he has no choice but to inhibit himself 
voluntarily. It is basic that â[a] judge may not be legally prohibited 
from sitting in a litigation, but when circumstances appear that will 
induce doubt [on] his honest actuations and probity in favor of either 
party, or incite such state of mind, he should conduct a careful 
self-examination. He should exercise his discretion in a way that the 
peopleâs faith in the courts of justice is not impaired. The better 
course for the judge is to disqualify himself.â
[42]
 


Third Issue:
    


Omnibus Motion Ineffective?
 


Private respondent insists that the petitionersâ Omnibus Motion
[43]

 dated February 14, 1996 is a mere scrap of paper, as it contained a 
notice of hearing addressed only to the clerk of court with no proof of 
its service to the opposing counsel.
[44]

 Private respondent is clutching at straws. The petitionersâ Omnibus 
Motion was filed pursuant to the trial courtâs own order to show cause 
why the injunction should not issue. It actually partakes of a brief or 
memorandum showing the trial courtâs lack of jurisdiction to issue the 
preliminary injunction. The Omnibus Motion raised a very important 
matter which the court itself could have ruled on, even 
motu proprio
, considering that a jurisdictional question may be raised at any time, even for the first time on appeal.
[45]

 Moreover, as expressed by petitioners, the issue is now moot, since the
 private respondent filed an Amended Complaint giving petitioner another
 fifteen days to file a responsive pleading. Within the said period, 
âpetitioners filed a Manifestation and Motion dated 7 March 1996, 
adopting the Omnibus Motion of 14 February 1996 and the Motion for 
Reconsideration with Cautionary Notice against the Amended Complaint and
 the application for writ of preliminary injunction therein contained.â
[46]
 


Fourth Issue: 
Motion for Reconsideration Actually Filed
 


Finally, private respondent alleges that the petition should be 
dismissed on the ground that petitioners did not file a motion for 
reconsideration.
[47]
 This allegation is negated by the simple fact that a Motion for Reconsideration with Cautionary Notice,
[48]
 although denied by the trial court, was actually filed by petitioners within the prescribed period.                          


Epilogue                          


Litigants, lawyers and judges sometimes forget that they share the 
responsibility of unclogging the dockets of the judiciary. As a 
lamentable consequence, this Court is compelled to resolve cases which 
are utterly bereft of merit. This is one of those cases.                
          


Private Respondent Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation (âMalayan,â for brevity) was the petitioner in 
Malayan Integrated Industries, Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.
,
[49]

 in which this Court, citing PD 1818, held that no writ of injunction 
may be issued to prevent the implementation of the reclamation project 
along the coast of Mandaue City, which was deemed an infrastructure 
project. In the present case, Private Respondent Malayan, nevertheless 
sought again the issuance of an injunctive writ to restrain the 
implementation of a similar reclamation project in adjacent Cebu City. 
In initiating the present proceedings, private respondent evidently 
ignored our earlier pronouncement and unnecessarily clogged the dockets 
of our courts.                          


The respondent trial judge, on the other hand, abetted Malayanâs 
brazen disregard of this Courtâs earlier ruling. Worse, he ruled that 
the earlier case did not apply, because âE.O. No. 380 was not presented 
by the parties for consideration by the High Court.â
[50]

 He maintained that EO 380, dated November 27, 1989, did not include 
reclamation projects in the definition of infrastructure projects.      
                    


As earlier stated, the ruling of the trial court is lamentable. We 
note that, in the first place, EO 380 did not purport to be an exclusive
 enumeration of infrastructure projects. Moreover, the Supreme Court 
itself held -- after the effectivity of EO 380 -- that reclamation 
projects are deemed infrastructure projects, thereby resolving the 
present question with finality. It is unfortunate that the trial court 
cavalierly contravened a categorical ruling of the Supreme Court. But 
even more deplorable, it insinuated that this Court did not take into 
account all applicable extant laws. To propound such view is to 
undermine the peopleâs trust and confidence in the judiciary. This, we 
cannot countenance. It is opportune to remind judges of their sworn duty
 to follow the doctrines and rulings of this Court.                     
     


In issuing writs of injunction, judges should observe the admonition of the Court in 
Olalia vs. Hizon
:
[51]
 




âIt has been consistently held that there is no power the 
exercise of which is more delicate, which requires greater caution, 
deliberation and sound discretion, or more dangerous in a doubtful case,
 than the issuance of an injunction. It is the strong arm of equity that
 should never be extended unless to cases of great injury, where courts 
of law cannot afford an adequate or commensurate remedy in damages. 


Every court should remember that an injunction is a limitation 
upon the freedom of action of the defendant and should not be granted 
lightly or precipitately. 
It should be granted only when the court is fully satisfied that the law permits it and the emergency demands it
.â
