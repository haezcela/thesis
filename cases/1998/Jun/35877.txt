JOSE A. LINZAG AND THE HEIRS OF CRISTOBAL A. LINZAG, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, THE PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH IV, MATI, DAVAO ORIENTAL, PATRICIO S. CUNANAN, ORLANDO SALVADOR, MANUEL P. BLANCO, JR., JOSE MANUEL SERRANO AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MATI, DAVAO ORIENTAL, RESPONDENTS.

DAVIDE, JR., J.:


May a party aggrieved by a judgment of a cadastral court and who 
subsequently obtains an unfavorable judgment in an action to annul the 
original certificate of title issued pursuant to the former, and then 
loses both in the Court of Appeals and in this Court in the appeal from 
the latter, be allowed to file with the Court of Appeals an action to 
annul the judgment of the cadastral court? The Court of Appeals resolved
 the issue in the negative on the ground of 
res judicata
. Hence, this special civil action of 
certiorari
.

We affirm the Court of Appeals not only because of absence of 
grave abuse of discretion, but likewise because an action for annulment 
of judgment was no longer available. Moreover, the instant special 
action was not the proper remedy against the challenged decision of the 
Court of Appeals. 

As gathered from the decisions of the trial court and the Court 
of Appeals and the pleadings of the parties, the following are the 
material facts in this case:

Petitioners Jose A. Linzag and the heirs of Cristobal A. Linzag 
are members of the non-Christian tribe known as the Kalagan tribe of 
Mati, Davao Oriental. Jose and Cristobal claim to have inherited from 
their deceased parents, Datu Joaquin Linzag and Regina Agustino, a 
parcel of land, otherwise known as Waniban Island, designated as Lot No.
 1222 of the Mati Cadastre, with an area of 36,575 square meters, more 
or less.
[1]


At the cadastral proceeding (CAD CASE No. N-16, LRC Cad. Record 
N-326) involving Lot No. 1222 before the then Court of First Instance of
 Davao Oriental sitting in Mati, Davao Oriental, Cristobal Linzag filed 
his claim over said Lot. Another claimant, one Patricio Cunanan, 
likewise filed a claim.

On 26 July 1971, one Orlando L. Salvador filed a motion
[2]

 to award Lot No. 1222, as an uncontested lot, in his favor. He alleged 
therein that he had acquired the rights of Patricio Cunanan for 
sufficient consideration and that the other claimant, Cristobal Linzag, 
had withdrawn his answer/claim in favor of Patricio Cunanan and/or his 
successors-in-interest, thereby making said lot as a ânon-contested 
lot.â At the hearing of the motion, which was not opposed by the 
Director of Lands, then represented by the Office of the Provincial 
Fiscal, Salvador offered in evidence the following: (a) a âDeed of 
Absolute Sale of Hereditary Rights Over an Unregistered Landâ covering 
Lot No. 1222 executed on 29 December 1970
[3]

 by Patricio S. Cunanan, Avelina C. Salazar, Elena C. Abayari, Igualdad 
Cunanan, Diosdado Cunanan, Lakandula Cunanan, Josefina C. Sibala as 
vendors and Orlando L. Salvador as vendee; and (b) a verified 
âWithdrawal of Claim/Answerâ dated 13 July 1971
[4]
 signed by Cristobal and Jose Linzag and executed in favor of Patricio Cunanan and/or his successorâs-in-interests. 

On 10 August 1971, the cadastral court, on the basis of the foregoing, issued an Order
[5]

 declaring that Salvador and his predecessors-in-interests had been in 
peaceful, open, continuous, exclusive and adverse possession of Lot No. 
1222, in concept of an owner for a period of at least 30 years; that 
Salvador was the successor-in-interest of original claimant Patricio S. 
Cunanan; and that the lot was a non-contested lot. The court thus 
decreed: 



WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court hereby adjudicates Lot 
No. 1222, together with all its improvements thereon, in favor of:
  


ORLANDO L. SALVADOR, of legal age, Filipino, married to Jovita B. Ramos-Salvador, a resident of ParaÃ±aque, Rizal. 


The Land Registration Commissioner is hereby directed to issue the 
corresponding decree of registration for said Lot No. 1222, as soon as 
this Order becomes final and executory.
  




After the Order became final, the cadastral court issued an Order
[6]
 directing issuance of the decree of registration.

In due time, Decree No. N-137262 was issued. Then on 13 October 
1971, pursuant to said Decree, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 
O-2039
[7]
 covering Lot No. 1222 was issued in the name of Orlando L. Salvador.

On 4 February 1977, petitioners herein filed an action for annulment of title and reconveyance with damages
[8]

 against private respondents Patricio Cunanan and Orlando Salvador 
before the Court of First instance of Mati, Davao Oriental (docketed as 
Civil Case No. 571). 

On 10 June 1977, petitioners filed an amended complaint
[9]
 wherein they alleged, 
inter alia
,
 that they and their predecessors-in-interests had been in actual, 
lawful, peaceful, public, adverse and uninterrupted possession and 
occupation of the land since the Spanish regime up to the present; the 
lot was ancestral land of the Linzags; the lot had been included in a 
prior land registration case filed by Patricio Cunanan which was decided
 against him, with the land registration court holding that the land was
 âpart of the public domain,â which decision was affirmed by the Court 
of Appeals on 19 November 1960 in CA-G.R. No. 19594-B; that in the 
cadastral proceedings, specifically on 13 July 1971 and after the 
effectivity of said decision of the Court of Appeals, Patricio Cunanan, 
with the aid and participation of his son-in-law, Atty. Galileo Sibala, 
procured, through fraud, the signatures of Jose and Cristobal Linzag on a
 document which turned out to be a withdrawal of their claim to Lot No. 
1222 by representing to them that it was a deed of mortgage over the lot
 in consideration of P3,000.00; and thereafter, Cunanan, together with 
the heirs of his deceased wife, sold the lot to Orlando Salvador for the
 sum of P25,000.00. Petitioners further alleged that both the withdrawal
 of claim and deed of absolute sale were notarized by Atty. Sibala; on 
the basis of the deed of sale in his favor, Salvador filed a motion with
 the cadastral court to adjudicate the lot in his favor as an 
uncontested lot; that the cadastral court granted the motion and as a 
consequence thereof, OCT No. 0-2039 was issued in Salvadorâs name; and 
that it was only on 14 May 1974 that petitioners discovered the fraud. 
They then prayed for judgment directing the Register of Deeds of Davao 
Oriental to issue a certificate of title in petitionersâ names, and 
ordering defendants to pay moral and exemplary damages, attorneyâs fees 
and transportation expenses.

In its decision
[10]
 
dated 14 February 1984, the trial court dismissed Civil Case No. 571 
because the âaction [was] improper and that the claim of plaintiffs have
 not been duly substantiated by them.â The court likewise ruled that 
plaintiffs therein were not the true owners of the property; plaintiffs 
failed to prove extrinsic fraud; there was no evidence that Salvador was
 a buyer in bad faith; and that the action was filed beyond the 
prescriptive period.

Petitioners appealed the above decision to the Court of Appeals (Eighth Division) in CA-G.R. CV No. 03329. In its decision
[11]
 of 25 July 1989, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the ground of prescription.

Petitioners thereafter appealed to this Court by way of a 
petition for review, which was docketed as G.R. No. 89441. In the 
resolution
[12]
 of 2 October 
1989, this Court (First Division) denied the petition âfor late filingâ 
and decreed that the judgment sought to be reviewed âhas now become 
final and executory.â

Meanwhile, on 9 November 1993, Original Certificate of Title No. 
O-2039 was cancelled and the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Davao
 Oriental issued a Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-16604
[13]
 in the name of Manuel P. Blanco, Jr. and Jose Manuel Serrano.

Undaunted by the foregoing adverse events, on 5 December 1994, petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals, a petition
[14]

 for the annulment of judgment of the then Court of First Instance of 
Mati, Davao Oriental in CAD. CASE No. N-16, LRC Cad. Record No. N-326 
concerning Lot No. 1222 (docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 35877). Impleaded as
 respondents were the presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court of 
Mati, Davao Oriental, which succeeded the former Court of First Instance
 that decided the cadastral case, herein private respondents Patricio 
Cunanan, Orlando Salvador, Manuel Blanco, Jr., Jose Manuel Serrano and 
the Register of Deeds of Davao Oriental. 

In its decision
[15]
 of 
28 February 1995, public respondent Court of Appeals dismissed the 
petition for being barred by the judgment in Civil Case No. 571, 
i.e.
, on ground of 
res judicata
. The appellate courtâs extensive discussion
[16]
 on this issue deserves to be quoted, thus: 



On the issue of 
res judicata
, the private respondent point
 [sic] to the decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao Oriental 
in Civil Case 571 affirmed by this Court in CA G.R. CV. 03329. It was 
argued that this previous case involved the same parties, subject matter
 and cause of action as this instant petition, and is, therefore, a bar 
to this petition.
  


An action is barred by a former judgment if (1) the former judgment
 is final; (2) the court which rendered it has jurisdiction over the 
subject matter and the parties; (3) it must be a judgment on the merits;
 (4) there must be, between the first and the second actions, identity 
of parties, subject matter and causes of action.
  


An examination of the records show [sic] that the first three 
requirements for the application of the doctrine of res judicata are 
present in this case.
  


The petitioners themselves related in their petition that they had 
instituted a complaint for annulment of title and reconveyance with 
damages against the private respondents, Salvador and Cunanan. The 
complaint was dated 10 June 1977 and was docketed as Civil Case No. 571 
of the then Court of First Instance of Davao Oriental.
  


On 14 February 1984, the Court of First Instance rendered judgment 
against the petitioners dismissing their complaint and ordering them to 
pay Orlando Salvador P5,000.00 and Patricio Cunanan, P2,000.00 by way of
 litigation expenses and attorneyâs fees (see Decision, Annex âJâ, 
Petition; Rollo, pp. 50-68). 


The judgment was affirmed by this Court in CA G.R. No. 03329 (âJose
 A. Linzag, et. [sic] al. vs. Patricio Cunan, et. [sic] al.â) in a 
decision rendered on 25 July 1989 (see copy of Decision; Annex âKâ, 
Petition; Rollo, pp. 69-74). 


The petition for review with the Supreme Court was not filed within
 the extension period granted to the petitioners. Thus, on 2 October 
1989 the Supreme Court issued a Resolution stating that no appeal was 
taken on time by the petitioners and the judgment had already become 
final and executory (Annex âLâ, Petition; Rollo, p. 75). 


The judgment in Civil Case 571 (i.e., the annulment case) having 
already become final as pronounced in the Supreme Court Resolution, the 
first requirement for the application of 
res judicata
 is, therefore, present.
  


The Court of First Instance of Davao Oriental undoubtedly has 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. The parcel of land in 
question is located within the province and as such, lies within the 
territorial jurisdiction of said court. No question on the jurisdiction 
of the trial court over the parties appears to have been raised.
  


The judgment was on the merits as it was rendered after a 
determination of which party is right and was not merely based on a 
preliminary or technical issue (see Santos vs. Intermediate Appellate 
Court, 145 SCRA 238, 245-246). A reading of the decision of the trial 
court shows that it was based on matters of substance and not merely on 
technical points.
  


There is also an identity between the parties in this petition and 
that in Civil Case 571. The petitioners in this case, Jose Linzag and 
the Heirs of Cristobal Linzag are likewise the plaintiffs in Civil Case 
571. The defendants in Civil Case 571 are also the private respondents 
in this case. The inclusion of Manuel Serrano and Jose Manuel Blanco as 
private respondents does not affect the identity of the parties as these
 two are successors-in-interest of original defendant Orlando Salvador.
  


The subject matter between the two cases are also identical. It is 
the parcel of land known as Waniban Island in Mati, Davao Oriental and 
the certificate of title covering such property.
  


The issue is whether or not there is an identity in the causes of action between this petition and Civil Case No. 571.
  


The test generally applied in determining whether causes of action 
are identical as to warrant the application of the doctrine of 
res judicata

 is to consider whether there is an identity in the facts essential to 
the maintenance of the two actions or whether the same evidence will 
sustain both. This is regardless [of whether] the form or nature of the 
two actions are different. If the same facts or evidence can sustain 
either, the two actions are considered the same so that the judgment in 
one is [a] bar to the other. If, however, the two actions rest upon two 
different state [sic] of facts, or if different proofs would be required
 to sustain the two actions, a judgment in one is not a bar to the 
maintenance of the other (Nabus vs. Court of Appeals, 193 SCRA 732; Aroc
 vs. Peopleâs Homesite and Housing Corporation, 81 SCRA 350; Pagsisihan 
vs. Court of Appeals, 95 SCRA 540). 


In this petition, the petitioners claim for nullity of judgment and
 their argument of lack of notice to them in the cadastral case [is] 
essentially based on allegations of fraud. As narrated earlier, the 
petitioners also alleged that the documents submitted by the private 
respondents to support their application for registration were 
fraudulent. They further alleged that the withdrawal of claim filed in 
their behalf in the cadastral case was procured through fraud.
  


It is, however, clear from the complaint and the decision in Civil 
Case 571, attached to this petition, that these issues have already been
 raised by the petitioners and passed upon by the trial court. This can 
be shown by the following excerpts of the decision of the Court of First
 Instance.
  




In any case, even granting 
arguendo
 that plaintiffs or 
their predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the property 
before 1945, it would appear that at the time of the filing of the 
action, they had no more right [to] the property. The main thrust of 
plaintiffsâ assault on the validity of defendant Orlando Salvador is 
that the waiver of claim is null and void, did not reflect truly the 
intention of the parties. 


An examination of the testimonies of the two (2) witnesses for 
the plaintiffs, Jose Linzag and Salvacion vda. De Linzag, who were twice
 presented as witnesses will show that plaintiffs were not able to 
successfully substantiate their claim on the invalidity of said 
withdrawal of answer or claim. Nothing was said in their testimonies as 
would support the contention that the said instrument was not validly 
executed.
    


x x x
    


On the second requirement, that the land must be wrongfully 
registered through fraud, it is clear from jurisprudence that the fraud 
in securing title must be actual fraud and must be proven and that the 
said fraud must be extrinsic. It is clear that as earlier discussed, 
plaintiffs failed to prove any actual fraud. The alleged fraud 
plaintiffs claimed is not extrinsic fraud, granting that fraud was 
committed. xxx (See CFI Decision, pp. 10, 15; Rollo, pp. 59, 64)
    




Notably also, the underlying objective or relief sought in this 
petition and in the earlier case are essentially the same. It is the 
nullification of the land title in the name of the private respondents 
and the adjudication of the land in question to the petitioners. 
  


The only difference is the form and nature of the two actions; 
while the earlier complaint is for the annulment of the land title, this
 present petition is for the nullification of the judgment upon which 
the title sought to nullified (sic) in the first case was issued.
  


It is readily apparent, therefore, that were this petition to be 
given due course, the same evidence or set of facts as that considered 
by the Court of First Instance in the annulment case, Civil Case 571, 
will be also be [sic] considered in this petition. Applying then the 
test earlier discussed, this court finds that the causes of action in 
Civil Case 571 and in this petition are the same as to warrant the 
application of the doctrine of 
res judicata
.
  


In sum, we find that all the requirements for the application of 
res judicata

 are present in this case. This petition should, therefore, be 
dismissed. The difference in the form of the actions instituted is 
immaterial. The petitioners may not escape the effect of the doctrine by
 merely varying the form of his [sic] action (Filinvest Credit 
Corporation vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 207 SCRA 59, 63; Sangalang
 vs. Caparas, 151 SCRA 53; Ibabao vs. Court of Appeals, 150 SCRA 76, 
85).
  


The underlying philosophy of the doctrine of 
res judicata
 
is that parties should not be permitted to litigate the same issue more 
than once. When a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined
 by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial 
has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains 
unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity 
in them in law or estate. It is to the interest of the public that there
 should be an end to litigation by the same parties and their privies 
over a subject once fully and fairly adjudicated (Ibabao vs. 
Intermediate Appellate Court, supra, at p. 85; Sangalang vs. Caparas, 
supra, at p. 59).
  


As this petition is already barred by the judgment in Civil Case 
571, We see no other course of action but to resolve to dismiss this 
petition.
  




Their motion for reconsideration
[17]
 and supplemental motion for reconsideration
[18]
 having been denied by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution
[19]

 of 3 October 1995, on the ground that there existed âno new and cogent 
ground to warrant reversal or modification,â petitioners filed the 
instant special action for 
certiorari
 with 
mandamus
, raising the following issues:



(1) WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS CAN DENY DUE 
COURSE TO THE INSTANT PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT ON THE BASIS 
THAT THERE WAS AN EARLIER CASE FOR NULLIFICATION OF TITLE BEFORE THE 
REGIONAL TRIAL COURT;
  


(2) WHETHER OR NOT A PETITION FOR DECLARATION OF NULLITY OF TITLE 
FILED AND DISMISSED BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT IS A BAR (RES JUDICATA) 
TO THE FILING OF A PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT BEFORE THE COURT 
OF APPEALS OF AN LRC CASE RENDRED BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT SITTING AS
 A CADASTRAL COURT;
  


(3) WHETHER OF NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS CAN DENY DUE 
COURSE TO A VALID PETITION ORIGINALLY FILED BEFORE IT MERELY BECAUSE A 
CASE FOR ANNULMENT OF TITLE WAS ALREADY FILED AND DECIDED BEFORE THE 
REGIONAL TRIAL COURT;
  


(4) WHETHER OR NOT PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT OF WHICH THE 
HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS ORIGINAL JURISDICTION IS THE SAME AS A 
PETITION FOR NULLITY OF TITLE WHICH THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT HAS 
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION.
  


(5) WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL
 RIGHT OF THE PETITIONERS OF DUE PROCESS IN DISMISSING THE INSTANT CASE 
EVEN BEFORE RECEIVING EVIDENCE AND WITHOUT DETERMINING THE ACTUAL MERITS
 OF THE PETITION FILED FOR THE ANNULMENT OF A PATENTLY NULL AND VOID 
JUDGMENT.
  




Petitioners contend that the decision in Civil Case No. 571, an 
action for annulment of title and reconveyance with damages, does not 
constitute 
res judicata
 to bar the instant petition for 
annulment of judgment. Petitioners further insist that the 10 August 
1971 decision of the cadastral court is void for violation of due 
process and extrinsic fraud, stressing that a void judgment never 
acquires finality and is subject to collateral attack. Petitioners 
underscore that in the proceedings before the cadastral court they were 
not informed of the dates of hearing, and as a result, were unable to 
hire the services of counsel. Thus if they had been afforded their day 
in court, they could have proved possession of the land for the required
 number of years that would have entitled them to ownership thereof; and
 that private respondents procured spurious documents showing a waiver 
of petitionersâ claim over the disputed property. Moreover, petitioners 
were not furnished a copy of the trial courtâs decision. Finally, 
petitioners contend that the transfer of the land title to private 
respondents Blanco and Serrano, who failed to verify true ownership of 
the land, was part of Salvadorâs âfraudulent schemes and strategiesâ to 
deprive petitioners of an opportunity to recover the land.

Cunananâs comment
[20]
 
filed on 12 January 1996 does not meet squarely the substantive issues 
raised by petitioners and, instead, interposes the following defenses: 
(1) he is not a party-in-interest, having sold all his rights over the 
subject property to Orlando Salvador; (2) Galileo Sibala has not 
appeared as counsel on behalf of the other respondents; (3) there is no 
new and cogent reason to disturb the 28 February 1995 decision as the 
allegations in the petition are a mere rehash of the issues already 
passed upon by respondent Court of Appeals; and (4) the petition fails 
to show that petitionersâ motion for reconsideration was filed within 
the reglementary period.

In their comment filed on 4 October 1996, respondents Manuel P. 
Blanco, Jr. and Jose Manuel Serrano contend that: (1) petitioners were 
not denied due process since they were afforded ample opportunity to 
present their side of the controversy; (2) the trial courtâs finding on 
the issue of possession and extrinsic fraud must be accorded great 
weight and respect, if not finality, on appeal; (3)the transfer 
certificate of title evidencing their ownership over the land has become
 incontrovertible and indefeasible; (4) they are purchasers in good 
faith and for value and may safely rely on what appears on the face of 
the title; (5) the instant petition is barred by 
res judicata
; 
and (7) there is no showing that respondent Court of Appeals gravely 
abused its discretion when it refused to give due course to the 
petition.

Petitioners filed separate replies to the comments of Cunanan and Blanco and Serrano.

In his manifestation filed on 20 September 1996, counsel for 
private respondent Cunanan informed the Court that Cunanan died on 8 
April 1996, and on 20 November 1996, said counsel submitted the names 
and addresses of the heirs of Cunanan. Upon motion of petitioners, to 
which the other parties submitted their comment, the Court granted, on 2
 July 1997, petitionersâ motion to substitute the heirs of Cunanan for 
the latter.

The Court resolved to give due course to the petition and 
required the parties to submit their memoranda, which petitioners and 
respondents Serrano and Blanco did on 4 September 1997 and 26 August 
1997, respectively. The parties likewise filed reply memoranda. 

This petition is devoid of merit.

Respondent Court of Appeals did not err, much less, commit grave 
abuse of discretion, in dismissing CA-G.R. SP No. 35877 on ground of 
res judicata
. 

Paragraph (b) of Section 47(b), Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of 
Civil Procedure, which was likewise Section 47(b), Rule 39 of the 1964 
Rules of Court, enshrines the doctrine of 
res judicata
: 



SEC. 47. Effect of judgment or final orders. â The effect of a 
judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having 
jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as 
follows: 




xxx
    


(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect 
to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could 
have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and
 their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of
 the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing under 
the same title and in the same capacityâ¦
      






The doctrine of 
res judicata
 is a rule which pervades every 
well-regulated system of jurisprudence and is founded upon two grounds 
embodied in various maxims of the common law, namely: (1) public policy 
and necessity which makes it to the interest of the State that there 
should be an end to litigation - 
republicae ut sit litium
, and (2) the hardship on the individual that he should be vexed twice for the same cause â 
nemo debet bis vexari et eadem causa
.
 A contrary doctrine would subject the public peace and quiet to the 
will and neglect of individuals and prefer gratification of the 
litigious disposition on the part of suitors to the preservation of the 
public tranquility and happiness.
[21]


The requisites of 
res judicata
 are: (1) there must be a 
final judgment or order; (2) the court rendering it must have 
jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it must be a 
judgment or order on the merits; and (4) there must be, between the two 
cases, identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action.
[22]


The doctrine of 
res judicata
 has two aspects, to wit: 
(1) the effect of a judgment as a bar to the prosecution of a second 
action upon the same claim, demand or cause of action; and (2) preclude 
relitigation of a particular fact or issue in another action between the
 same parties on a different claim or cause of action.
[23]

 As earlier shown, the Court of Appeals convincingly demonstrated that 
the decision in Civil Case No. 571 of the Court of First Instance of 
Mati, Davao Oriental operates to bar, on the ground of 
res judicata
,
 the case for annulment of judgment -- CA-G.R. SP No. 35877. As stated 
earlier, the decision in Civil Case No. 571 dismissed petitionersâ 
complaint for annulment of title and reconveyance with damages; and, in 
effect, affirmed the judgment of the cadastral court. The judgment in 
Civil Case No. 571 was then affirmed by the Court of Appeals in its 
decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 03329, while a petition to review the latter 
was denied by this Court in G.R. No. 89441.

The claim of petitioners that the judgment in Civil Case No. 571 
does not bar CA-G.R. SP No. 35877 because the former was for annulment 
of title only, while the latter was for annulment of the judgment, is 
palpably unmeritorious. There is here a clear case of hair-splitting. It
 is settled that a party cannot evade or avoid the application of 
res judicata
 by simply varying the form of his action or adopting a different method of presenting his case.
[24]

 This is as good a time as any to remind lawyers that any attempt to do 
so merits the Courtâs condemnation for being an abuse or misuse of the 
rules of procedure.

We stress in this connection that petitioners may have resorted 
to the filing of Civil Case No. 571 because they had lost the right to 
file a petition for review. It is settled that a party deprived of his 
property in a cadastral proceeding may file within one (1) year from 
entry of the decree, a petition for review. After the lapse of said 
period, if the property has not yet passed on to an innocent purchaser 
for value, an action for reconveyance may still be filed by the 
aggrieved party.
[25]
 An action
 for reconveyance attacks not only the judgment of the cadastral court; 
it likewise seeks confirmation by the court of plaintiffsâ title to the 
land.

Another more telling reason why CA-G.R. SP No. 35877 should be 
dismissed was that the remedy of annulment of judgment allowed in 
Section 9(2) of B.P. Blg. 129 was no longer available to petitioners. 
Such is available only where the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal,
 petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer 
available through no fault of petitioners.
[26]

 Here, petitioners had, in fact, availed of an action for reconveyance 
where they litigated the grounds for annulment of judgment. There would 
be no end to litigations if parties who have unsuccessfully availed of 
any of the appropriate remedies or lost them through their fault would 
still be heard in an action to annul the judgment. 

A final word before ending.

The proper remedy of a party aggrieved by a decision of the Court
 of Appeals in an action to annul a judgment of a Regional Trial Court 
(or of its predecessor the Court of First Instance) is a petition for 
review on certiorari under Rule 45, where only questions of law may be 
raised. Petitioners, however, have availed of the special civil action 
for 
certiorari
 and 
mandamus
 under Rule 65 of the Rules
 of Court. No special reasons exist in this case to justify resort to 
Rule 65. Of course, every lawyer should be familiar with the obvious 
distinctions
[27]
between a special civil action for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 and an appeal by petition for review on 
certiorari

 under Rule 45. For one, that under Rule 45 is a continuation of the 
judgment complained of, while that under Rule 65 is an original or 
independent action.
[28]
 It is likewise settled that, generally, the special civil action of 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 will not be allowed as a substitute for failure to timely file a petition for review under Rule 45
[29]
 or for the lost remedy of appeal.
[30]


The wrong choice of remedy thus provides another reason to dismiss this petition.

Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 35877 is AFFIRMED
