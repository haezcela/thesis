[ G.R. No. 125788, June 05, 1998 ]


THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT (PCGG), PETITIONER, VS. HON. SANDIGANBAYAN AND AEROCOM INVESTORS & MANAGERS, INC., RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:




In its continuing search for âill-gotten wealthâ, herein 
petitioner Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed in 
the Sandiganbayan on July 22, 1987 a case (Civil Case No. 0009) for 
reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution and damages against 
Manuel H. Nieto, Jose L. Africa, Roberto S. Benedicto, Potenciano 
Ilusorio, Juan Ponce Enrile and Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. alleging, in 
substance, that said defendants acted as âdummiesâ of the late strongman
 and devised âschemesâ and âstrategemsâ to monopolize the 
telecommunications industry. Annexed to the complaint is a listing of 
the assets of defendants Nieto and Africa, among which are their shares 
of stock in private respondent Aerocom Investors and Managers, Inc. 
(Aerocom).
[1]
Almost a year later, the PCGG sought to sequester Aerocom under a writ of sequestration dated June 15, 1988,
[2]
 which was served on and received âunder protestâ by Aerocomâs president on August 3, 1988.
[3]


Seven (7) days after receipt of the sequestration order, Aerocom 
on August 10, 1988 filed a complaint against the PCGG (docketed as Civil
 Case No. 0044)
[4]
 urging the 
Sandiganbayan to nullify the same on the ground that it was served on 
Aerocom beyond the eighteen (18)-month period from the ratification of 
the 1987 Constitution as provided for in Section 26, Article XVIII 
thereof which reads:



â
Sec. 26
. The authority to issue sequestration or 
freeze orders under Proclamation No. 3 dated March 25, 1986 in relation 
to the recovery of ill-gotten wealth shall remain operative for not more
 than eighteen months after the ratification of this Constitution. 
However, in the national interest, as certified by the President, the 
Congress may extend said period.
  


âA sequestration or freeze order shall be issued only upon showing of a 
prima facie case
.
 The order and the list of the sequestered or frozen properties shall 
forthwith be registered with the proper court. For orders issued before 
the ratification of this Constitution, the corresponding judicial action
 or proceeding shall be filed within six months from its ratification. 
For those issued after such ratification, the judicial action or 
proceeding shall be commenced within six months from the issuance 
thereof. 


âThe sequestration or freeze order is deemed automatically lifted 
if no judicial action or proceeding is commenced as herein provided.â
  




In its amended answer dated May 19, 1992,
[5]

 the PCGG specifically alleged that Aerocom has no cause of action 
against it since the issuance of the writ of sequestration on June 15, 
1988 was well-within the 18-month constitutional deadline counted from 
February 2, 1987, the date when the people, in a plebiscite, 
overwhelmingly ratified the 1987 Constitution.

During the pendency of Civil Case No. 0044, Aerocom filed on July 5, 1995 a Manifestation and Motion
[6]

 praying that the Sandiganbayan direct the PCGG to release and 
distribute the dividends pertaining to the shares of Aerocom in all 
corporations where it owns shares of stock. Commenting thereon,
[7]

 the PCGG opposed the release of the dividends on the argument that âthe
 fact that plaintiff (Aerocom) is mentioned in Annex âAâ of the 
complaint filed in Civil Case No. 0009 is a clear indication that the 
shares thereof are likewise sequestered.â

The Sandiganbayan in its Resolution promulgated on January 31, 1996
[8]

 acted favorably on Aerocomâs Manifestation and Motion and thus ordered 
the PCGG to release the dividends pertaining to Aerocom except the 
dividends on the sequestered shares of stock registered in the names of 
Manuel Nieto and Jose Africa in POTC, ETPI and Aerocom, on the following
 findings:



âA close scrutiny of Annex `Aâ of the complaint in Civil Case No. 
0009, entitled `Republic of the Philippines vs. Jose L. Africa, Manuel 
H. Nieto, Jr., and Roberto S. Benedictoâ, does not show, that herein 
plaintiff Aerocom Investors & Managers, Inc., as a corporation, was 
itself sequestered. What was sequestered are the shares of stock of 
Manuel H. Nieto, Jr. and Jose L. Africa in Aerocom Investors & 
Managers, Inc. 


âDefendant PCGG is under estoppel from denying that it has in fact 
recognized and confirmed the non-sequestration status of herein 
plaintiff, as a corporation, by releasing the cash dividends due to the 
plaintiff from Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (POTC 
for short) per its Resolutions dated June 29, 1993 and May 6, 1994. The 
said PCGG Resolution, dated June 29, 1993 (Annex âAâ, Manifestation and 
Motion, p. 330, record) refers to its approval to release the POTC cash 
dividends declared in 1989 and 1991 pertaining to the shares of herein 
plaintiff Aerocom Investors & Managers, Inc. in Philippine Overseas 
Telecommunications Corporation. On the other hand, PCGG Resolution No. 
94-066 dated May 6, 1994 refers to its approval releasing the POTC cash 
dividends declared in 1993 and `accruing to the shares of stocks in 
POTC, registered under the name of Aerocom Investors & Managers, 
Inc., except cash dividends pertaining to the personal shares of Mr. 
Manuel H. Nieto, Jr. in POTC and likewise his shares of stocks in 
Aerocom Investors & Managers, Inc.â (Annex `Bâ, Manifestation and 
Motion, p. 331, record). 


âThere is no dispute that herein plaintiff, as a corporation, has a
 juridical personality separate and distinct from its stockholders.â
  




After a motion for reconsideration thereof was denied by the Sandiganbayan per Resolution promulgated on May 7, 1996,
[9]

 the PCGG filed the present petition for certiorari on August 16, 1996 
assailing the Sandiganbayan order for the release of the dividends as 
having been issued with grave abuse of discretion. In compliance with 
the Resolution of this Court dated September 2, 1996
[10]

 which also granted the temporary restraining order prayed for by the 
PCGG, Aerocom filed its comment on the petition on September 11, 1996
[11]
 to which, the PCGG on November 21, 1996 filed a reply.
[12]


The petition must fail.

There is merit in the initial point amplified by Aerocom in its 
comment that the instant certiorari proceedings brought by the PCGG is 
an improper remedy under the circumstances. From a reading of its 
January 31, 1996 Resolution granting Aerocomâs Manifestation and Motion,
 (as heretofore quoted), as well as the May 7, 1996 Resolution denying 
the motion for reconsideration, the Sandiganbayan has virtually passed 
upon the pivotal issue involved in Aerocomâs complaint for the 
declaration of nullity of the writ of sequestration (Civil Case No. 
0044) - i.e., whether or not Aerocomâs sequestration was in order. That 
courtâs finding to the effect that Aerocom was not validly sequestered, 
clearly, was a final adjudication on the merits which is reviewable by 
the appellate court only through an appeal under Rule 45 of the Rules of
 Court. The PCGG should have availed of the remedy of appeal filed 
within the statutory fifteen (15)-day period and not a petition for 
certiorari, as the arguments the PCGG propounds in support of its 
challenge on the Sandiganbayan Resolutions would amount to a digging 
into the merits and unearthing errors of judgment.
[13]
 At this juncture, â
[i]t must emphatically be reiterated,
â to borrow the words of Mr. Justice Regalado in 
Purefoods Corp. vs. NLRC
,
[14]
 
âsince
 so often is it overlooked, that the special civil action for certiorari
 is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and 
not errors of judgment. The reason for the rule is simple. When a court 
exercises its jurisdiction, an error committed while so engaged does not
 deprive it of the jurisdiction being exercised when the error is 
committed. If it did, every error committed by a court would deprive it 
of its jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment would be a void 
judgment. This cannot be allowed. The administration of justice would 
not survive such a rule. Consequently, an error of judgment that the 
court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction is not correctable 
through the original civil action of certiorari.â


Equally worth recalling is that certiorari is not and cannot be 
made a substitute for an appeal where the latter remedy is available
[15]
 but was lost thru the fault or negligence of petitioner,
[16]
 as in this case.

Even if we disregard such procedural flaw, the substantial contentions of the PCGG fail to invite judgment in its favor.

First
. We cannot subscribe to the PCGGâs theory that, as 
the first paragraph of Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution 
speaks only of âThe authority 
to issue
 . . .â, then there is 
faithful compliance with the 18-month constitutional deadline by the 
mere issuance of the writ of sequestration within that time-frame (June 
15, 1988) even if service thereof on Aerocom was effected thereafter 
(August 3, 1988).

The obvious intendment behind the 18-month period, as well as the
 six (6)-month time-limit for the filing of the corresponding judicial 
action, is to ensure the protection of property rights and to serve as a
 necessary safeguard against an overzealous exercise by the State, 
acting as âbounty-huntersâ so to speak, of its power of sequestration 
which, as described by Justice Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera in her 
concurring opinion in 
BASECO v. PCGG
,
[17]

 is an âextra-ordinary, harsh and severe remedy.â For this reason, â(I)t
 should be confinedâ, J. Herrera continues, âto its lawful parameters 
and exercised, with due regard, in the words of its enabling laws, to 
the requirements of fairness, due process, and Justice.â The probable 
evil of governmental abuse is best avoided and the dictates of 
âfairnessâ, âdue processâ and âJusticeâ are truly heeded under an 
interpretation of Section 26, Article XVIII as requiring both the 
issuance of the writ 
and
 notification to, or more precisely, the 
acquisition of jurisdiction over the entity/entities to be sequestered 
via valid service thereof, to be effected within the 18-month period. A 
writ of sequestration, therefore, runs the risk of being struck down as 
invalid if and when the twin requirements of issuance and service are 
not satisfied within the deadline.

Such is the fate of the subject writ of sequestration, 
unfortunately. Whether the 18-month period expired on July 26, 1988 (as 
claimed by Aerocom, in line with the computation of time under Article 
13 of the Civil Code and the ruling in âNational Marketing Corp. v. 
Tecson,â 29 SCRA 70) or on August 2, 1988 (the PCGGâs position), the 
fact remains that service of the writ on Aerocom on August 3, 1988 was 
made beyond these dates. The PCGGâs theory that the mere issuance of the
 writ within the 18-month deadline will suffice, is just too dangerous 
to accept. Imagine a scenario where the PCGG may have actually tarried 
in the issuance of the sequestration order to the prejudice of the 
would-be sequestered entity, and all that the PCGG has to do to cover 
its mistake is to conveniently ante-date the writ so as to feign timely 
compliance. That would, in effect, be allowing the PCGG to employ a 
subterfuge to validate what may in fact be a purely whimsical, unfounded
 and an âafterthoughtâ takeover of corporate property. The Constitution 
does not and can never tolerate such a deceptive maneuver. Service of 
the writ of sequestration within the 18-month period, then, is an 
imperative measure to guard against this kind of mischief, for it will 
certainly give the assurance that the writ was genuinely issued within 
that constitutional deadline.

Second
. The PCGG cannot justify its failure, as found by the Sandiganbayan,
[18]

 to file the corresponding judicial action against Aerocom within the 
six (6)-month period as provided for under the same constitutional 
provision in focus (Section 26, Article XVIII, second paragraph) by the 
fact that Aerocom was mentioned in the complaint of the PCGG in Civil 
Case No. 0009 (the Nieto, Africa, et al. case) and in Annex âAâ thereof 
notwithstanding that Aerocom was not impleaded as party-defendant, and 
on the argument that the filing of Civil Case No. 0009 against the 
âNieto, Africa, et al. groupâ is enough compliance with the âjudicial 
actionâ requirement. The case of 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 240 SCRA 376, January 23, 1995
,
 relied upon by the PCGG, has no rightful application, inasmuch as this 
Courtâs pronouncements therein, in answer to this crucial question:



âDOES INCLUSION IN THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY THE PCGG BEFORE THE 
SANDIGANBAYAN OF SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS OF CORPORATIONS BEING `DUMMIESâ OR
 UNDER THE CONTROL OF ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE DEFENDANTS NAMED THEREIN AND
 USED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR ACQUISITION, OR AS BEING DEPOSITARIES OR 
PRODUCTS, OF ILL-GOTTEN WEALTH; OR THE ANNEXING TO SAID COMPLAINTS OF A 
LIST OF SAID FIRMS, BUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY IMPLEADING THEM AS DEFENDANTS, 
SATISFY THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A 
SEIZURE EFFECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 1, s. 1986, THE 
CORRESPONDING `JUDICIAL ACTION OR PROCEEDINGâ SHOULD BE FILED WITHIN THE
 SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN SECTION 26, ARTICLE XVIII, OF THE (1987)
 CONSTITUTION?â, 




presuppose a valid and existing sequestration of the unimpleaded corporation/s concerned. Thus - 



â1) Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution does not, by its 
terms or any fair interpretation thereof, require that corporations or 
business enterprises alleged to be repositories      of `ill-gotten 
wealth,â as the term is used in said provision, be actually and formally
 impleaded in the actions for the recovery thereof, 
in order to maintain in effect existing sequestrations thereof
;
  


â2) complaints for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth which merely 
identify and/or allege said corporations or enterprises to be the 
instruments, repositories or the fruits of ill-gotten wealth, without 
more, come within the meaning of the phrase `corresponding judicial 
action or proceedingâ contemplated by the constitutional provision 
referred to; the more so, that normally, said corporations, as 
distinguished from their stockholders or members, are not generally 
suable for the latterâs illegal or criminal actuations in the 
acquisition of the assets invested by them in the former; 


â3) even assuming the impleading of said corporations to be 
necessary and proper so that judgment may comprehensively and 
effectively be rendered in the actions, amendment of the complaints to 
implead them as defendants may, under existing rules of procedure, be 
done at any time during the pendency of the actions thereby initiated, 
and even during the pendency of an appeal to the Supreme Court - a 
procedure that, in any case, is not inconsistent with or proscribed by 
the constitutional time limits to the filing of the corresponding 
complaints 
`forâ - i.e., with regard or in relation to, in respect 
of, or in connection with, or concerning - orders of sequestration, 
freezing, or provisional takeover.ââ
 xxx xxx xxx (underscoring supplied) 




There is no existing sequestration to talk about in this case, as the
 writ issued against Aerocom, to repeat, is invalid for reasons 
hereinbefore stated. Ergo, the suit in Civil Case No. 0009 against Mr. 
Nieto and Mr. Africa as shareholders in Aerocom is not and cannot ipso 
facto be a suit against the unimpleaded Aerocom itself without violating
 the fundamental principle that a corporation has a legal personality 
distinct and separate from its stockholders. Such is the ruling laid 
down in 
PCGG v. Interco
[19]
 reiterated anew in a case of more recent vintage - 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan, Sipalay Trading Corp. and Allied Banking Corp.
[20]
 where this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Ricardo J. Francisco,
[21]
 hewed to the lone dissent of Mr. Justice Teodoro R. Padilla
[22]
 in the very same 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan
 case herein invoked by the PCGG, to wit:



âx x x failure to implead these corporations as defendants and 
merely annexing a list of such corporations to the complaints is a 
violation of their right to due process for it would in effect be 
disregarding their distinct and separate personality without a hearing. 


âIn cases where stocks of a corporation were allegedly the fruits 
of ill-gotten wealth, it should be remembered that in most of these 
cases the stocks involved constitute a substantial if not controlling 
interest in the corporations. The basic tenets of fair play demand that 
these corporations be impleaded as defendants since a judgment in favor 
of the government will undoubtedly substantially and decisively affect 
the corporations as distinct entities. The judgment could strip them of 
everything without being previously heard as they are not parties to the
 action in which the judgment is rendered. 


âx x x. Holding that the `corresponding judicial action or 
proceedingâ contemplated by the Constitution is any action concerning or
 involving the corporation under sequestration is oversimplifying the 
solution, the result of which is antagonistic to the principles of 
justice and fair play. 


âx x x the actions contemplated by the Constitution should be 
those which include the corporation not as a mere annex to the complaint
 but as defendant. This is the minimum requirement of the due process 
guarantee
. Short of being impleaded, the corporation has no 
standing in the judicial action. It cannot adequately defend itself. It 
may not even be heard. 


âOn the x x x opinion that alternatively the corporations can be 
impleaded as defendants by amendment of the complaint, Section 26, 
Article XVIII of the Constitution would appear to preclude this 
procedure, for allowing amendment of the complaint to implead 
theretofore unimpleaded corporations would in effect allow complaints 
against the corporation 
to be filed beyond the periods fixed by said Section 26
. 


xxx                                    xxx                                          xxx
  


âWhile government efforts to recover illegally amassed wealth 
should have support from all its branches, eagerness and zeal should not
 be allowed to run berserk, overriding in the process the very 
principles that it is sworn to uphold. In our legal system, the ends do 
not always justify the means. Wrongs are never corrected by committing 
other wrongs, and as above-discussed the recovery of ill-gotten wealth 
does not and should never justify unreasonable intrusions into 
constitutionally forbidden grounds. x x x.â
  




The last area of discussion touches on the doctrine of estoppel. Let 
us rewind the events for a clear understanding of the issue involved. 

During the pendency of the Aerocom complaint against the PCGG, 
the latter approved the release of the cash dividends declared in the 
years 1989, 1991 and 1993 accruing to the shares of stock of Aerocom in 
the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Co. (POTC) per PCGG 
Certification dated June 29, 1993

The PCGG issued the aforequoted âCertificationâ and âResolution 94-066â apparently on the basis of a âMemorandumâ
[24]

 prepared by Atty. Ismael B. Sanchez, former legal counsel of the PCGG, 
advising the latter not to interpose any objection to the release of the
 POTC cash dividends. A portion of the âMemorandumâ reads:



âTHE ISSUES:

Is there legal basis to withhold the release of the POTC cash 
dividends declared in 1989 and 1991 in favor of Mr. Nieto and Aerocom? 
Was the sequestration order over Aerocom issued validly? 


â
As to the first issue
.

âAs resolved by the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution of October 2,
 1991 and January 25, 1993, the PCGG has no authority to withhold 
satisfaction and release of dividends to stockholders whose shares in 
POTC are not and have never been sequestered. Thus, the Sandiganbayan 
ruled:



`We have gone over the pleadings filed by the parties, and we find 
that herein petitioners, whose stockholdings in the POTC are not 
sequestered, have the right to the payment of their respective 
dividends. Respondent PCGG has no authority to withhold satisfaction and
 release of the same.â
  




âThere is nothing in the records of the Commission to show that a 
sequestration order issued against the shares of Mr. Nieto Jr. and 
Aerocom in POTC. A distinction must be made in the matter of 
sequestration of the corporation itself and the sequestration of 
corporate shareholdings in another corporation. (Please see NOTE above 
regarding sequestration of Aerocom) The sequestration refers to Aerocom 
as a corporation. 


âBeing similarly situated as the petitioners in Sandiganbayan Civil 
Case No. 118 and considering the relevant facts stated above, it is the 
opinion of the undersigned that the POTC dividends due Mr. Nieto and 
Aerocom may be released to them. 


â
As to the second issue
. 


âWith respect to the writ of sequestration issued on June 15, 1988 
against Aerocom and served on August 3, 1988, the following points are 
to be considered: 


â(1) It may be argued that this writ is a `midnightâ sequestration 
order considering the date of its issuance and the date it was served on
 Aerocom, that is, four (4) days before the expiration of the authority 
of PCGG to issue sequestration or freeze order as provided under Section
 26, Article XVIII of the 1987 Constitution. 


â(2) The sequestration order in question was issued after the 
effectivity of the 1987 Constitution exactly on June 15, 1988. As such, 
the sequestration order can only be issued upon showing a 
prima facie

 case of ill-gotten wealth. Nothing was mentioned in the writ against 
Aerocom of any ground or basis for its issuance. It just stated that the
 company is placed under sequestration. 


â(3) Even assuming that it was valid when issued, the sequestration 
order was never implemented. In fact, in Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 
044, the PCGG through the Office of the Solicitor General agreed not to 
implement the sequestration order as earlier discussed. 


â(4) PCGG has not filed any action against Aerocom. In the Interco 
case, the Supreme Court, citing Section 26, Article XVIII of the 
Constitution, has ruled and held `the sequestration or freeze order is 
deemed automatically lifted if no judicial action or proceeding is 
commenced as herein provided.â Any action or proceeding against Aerocom 
should have been commenced or filed within six (6) months from June 15, 
1988. 


âCONCLUSION: 


âIN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, it our considered opinion and 
recommendation that the Commission interpose no objection to the release
 of the POTC cash dividends declared in 1989 and 1991 in favor of Mr. 
Nieto Jr. and Aerocom Investors, Inc. 


âFurthermore, appropriate instruction be given to the assigned Asset 
Monitor in POTC to approve the corresponding checks covering the cash 
dividends due Mr. Nieto Jr. and Aerocom Investors, Inc.â



(SGD.)          
      

      ISMAEL B. SANCHEZâ
  




Taking into account these documents, the Sandiganbayan thus found the
 PCGG to be in estoppel from denying the non-sequestered status of 
Aerocom and from refusing the release of cash dividends in favor of the 
latter. The PCGG takes exception to this finding on the claim that the 
State should not be held vulnerable to estoppel for the acts of past 
officials.

The PCGGâs contention is not persuasive under the attendant 
circumstances. While we agree with the statement that the State is 
immune from estoppel, this concept, as clarified by this Court thru Mr. 
Justice Melo in 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan, et al
.
[25]
 âis understood to refer to acts and mistakes of its officials especially those which are irregular.â
[26]

 Here, other than its bare assertion that Atty. Sanchezâs âOpinionâ is 
âillegal and prejudicialâ, the PCGG has not presented convincing 
evidence to prove irregularity or negligence on the part of Atty. 
Sanchez in rendering his âOpinionâ favorable to Aerocom. In fact, no 
less than PCGG Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo and the rest of the 
Commissioners clearly heeded the recommendation of Atty. Sanchez by 
affixing their signatures on Resolution No. 94-066 allowing the release 
of the cash dividends declared in 1993 accruing to Aerocomâs shares of 
stock in POTC. Elementary notions of consistency and fair play call upon
 the PCGG to honor the release of the cash dividends presently requested
 by Aerocom, after a similar commitment has been collectively confirmed 
by its commissioners in black and white. âA ruling to the contraryâ, in 
the erudite language of Justice Escareal of the Sandiganbayan as adopted
 in 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 226 SCRA 314
, âis not 
only illogical and irrational, but inequitable and pernicious as well, 
for it may open the door for capricious adventurism on the part of the 
policy-makers of the land, and disregard for the majesty of the law, 
which could ultimately bring about the citizenryâs loss of faith and 
confidence in the sincerity of the government in its dealings with the 
governed.â

WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is hereby 
DISMISSED. The assailed Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan promulgated on 
January 31, 1996 and May 7, 1996 are AFFIRMED in their entirety.

SO ORDERED.



Regalado, (Chairman.), Puno,
 and 
Mendoza, JJ.
, concur.

Melo, J.
