SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 124922, June 22, 1998 ]


JIMMY CO, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME & STYLE DRAGON METAL MANUFACTURING, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND BROADWAY MOTOR SALES CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


On July 18, 1990, petitioner entrusted his Nissan pick-up car 1988 model
[1]

 to private respondent - which is engaged in the sale, distribution and 
repair of motor vehicles - for the following job repair services and 
supply of parts:



- Bleed injection pump and all nozzles;
  
- Adjust valve tappet;
  
- Change oil and filter;
  
- Open up and service four wheel brakes, clean and adjust;
  
- Lubricate accelerator linkages;
  
- Replace aircon belt; and
  
- Replace battery
[2]






Private respondent undertook to return the vehicle on July 21, 1990 
fully serviced and supplied in accordance with the job contract. After 
petitioner paid in full the repair bill in the amount of P1,397.00,
[3]

 private respondent issued to him a gate pass for the release of the 
vehicle on said date. But came July 21, 1990, the latter could not 
release the vehicle as its battery was weak and was not yet replaced. 
Left with no option, petitioner himself bought a new battery nearby and 
delivered it to private respondent for installation on the same day. 
However, the battery was not installed and the delivery of the car was 
rescheduled to July 24, 1990 or three (3) days later. When petitioner 
sought to reclaim his car in the afternoon of July 24, 1990, he was told
 that it was carnapped earlier that morning while being road-tested by 
private respondentâs employee along Pedro Gil and Perez Streets in Paco,
 Manila. Private respondent said that the incident was reported to the 
police.

Having failed to recover his car and its accessories or the value
 thereof, petitioner filed a suit for damages against private respondent
 anchoring his claim on the latterâs alleged negligence. For its part, 
private respondent contended that it has no liability because the car 
was lost as a result of a fortuitous event - the carnapping. During 
pre-trial, the parties agreed that:



â(T)he cost of the Nissan Pick-up four (4) door when the plaintiff 
purchased it from the defendant is P332,500.00 excluding accessories 
which were installed in the vehicle by the plaintiff consisting of four 
(4) brand new tires, magwheels, stereo speaker, amplifier which amount 
all in all to P20,000.00. It is agreed that the vehicle was lost on July
 24, 1990 `approximately two (2) years and five (5) months from the date
 of the purchase.â It was agreed that the plaintiff paid the defendant 
the cost of service and repairs as early as July 21, 1990 in the amount 
of P1,397.00 which amount was received and duly receipted by the 
defendant company. It was also agreed that the present value of a brand 
new vehicle of the same type at this time is P425,000.00 without 
accessories.â
[4]






They likewise agreed that the sole issue for trial was who between 
the parties shall bear the loss of the vehicle which necessitates the 
resolution of whether private respondent was indeed negligent.
[5]
 After trial, the court 
a quo

 found private respondent guilty of delay in the performance of its 
obligation and held it liable to petitioner for the value of the lost 
vehicle and its accessories plus interest and attorneyâs fees.
[6]

 On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the ruling of the lower 
court and ordered the dismissal of petitionerâs damage suit.
[7]

 The CA ruled that: (1) the trial court was limited to resolving the 
issue of negligence as agreed during pre-trial; hence it cannot pass on 
the issue of delay; and (2) the vehicle was lost due to a fortuitous 
event. 

In a petition for review to this Court, the principal query 
raised is whether a repair shop can be held liable for the loss of a 
customerâs vehicle while the same is in its custody for repair or other 
job services?

The Court resolves the query in favor of the customer. First, on 
the technical aspect involved. Contrary to the CAâs pronouncement, the 
rule that the determination of issues at a pre-trial conference bars the
 consideration of other issues on appeal, except those that may involve 
privilege or impeaching matter,
[8]

 is inapplicable to this case. The question of delay, though not 
specifically mentioned as an issue at the pre-trial may be tackled by 
the court considering that it is necessarily intertwined and intimately 
connected with the principal issue agreed upon by the parties, i.e. who 
will bear the loss and whether there was negligence. Petitionerâs 
imputation of negligence to private respondent is premised on delay 
which is the very basis of the formerâs complaint. Thus, it was 
unavoidable for the court to resolve the case, particularly the question
 of negligence without considering whether private respondent was guilty
 of delay in the performance of its obligation.

On the merits. It is a not a defense for a repair shop of motor 
vehicles to escape liability simply because the damage or loss of a 
thing lawfully placed in its possession was due to carnapping. 
Carnapping 
per se
 cannot be considered as a fortuitous event. 
The fact that a thing was unlawfully and forcefully taken from anotherâs
 rightful possession, as in cases of carnapping, does not automatically 
give rise to a fortuitous event. To be considered as such, carnapping 
entails more than the mere forceful taking of anotherâs property. It 
must be proved and established that the event was an act of God or was 
done solely by third parties and that neither the claimant nor the 
person alleged to be negligent has any participation.
[9]

 In accordance with the Rules of evidence, the burden of proving that 
the loss was due to a fortuitous event rests on him who invokes it
[10]
-
 which in this case is the private respondent. However, other than the 
police report of the alleged carnapping incident, no other evidence was 
presented by private respondent to the effect that the incident was not 
due to its fault. A police report of an alleged crime, to which only 
private respondent is privy, does not suffice to established the 
carnapping. Neither does it prove that there was no fault on the part of
 private respondent notwithstanding the partiesâ agreement at the 
pre-trial that the car was carnapped. Carnapping does not foreclose the 
possibility of fault or negligence on the part of private respondent.

Even assuming 
arguendo
 that carnapping was duly established as a fortuitous event, still private respondent cannot escape liability. Article 1165
[11]

 of the New Civil Code makes an obligor who is guilty of delay 
responsible even for a fortuitous event until he has effected the 
delivery. In this case, private respondent was already in delay as it 
was supposed to deliver petitionerâs car three (3) days before it was 
lost. Petitionerâs agreement to the rescheduled delivery does not defeat
 his claim as private respondent had already breached its obligation. 
Moreover, such accession cannot be construed as waiver of petitionerâs 
right to hold private respondent liable because the car was unusable and
 thus, petitioner had no option but to leave it.

Assuming further that there was no delay, still working against 
private respondent is the legal presumption under Article 1265 that its 
possession of the thing at the time it was lost was due to its fault.
[12]

 This presumption is reasonable since he who has the custody and care of
 the thing can easily explain the circumstances of the loss. The vehicle
 owner has no duty to show that the repair shop was at fault. All that 
petitioner needs to prove, as claimant, is the simple fact that private 
respondent was in possession of the vehicle at the time it was lost. In 
this case, private respondentâs possession at the time of the loss is 
undisputed. Consequently, the burden shifts to the possessor who needs 
to present controverting evidence sufficient enough to overcome that 
presumption. Moreover, the exempting circumstances - earthquake, flood, 
storm or other natural calamity - when the presumption of fault is not 
applicable
[13]
 do not concur 
in this case. Accordingly, having failed to rebut the presumption and 
since the case does not fall under the exceptions, private respondent is
 answerable for the loss.

It must likewise be emphasized that pursuant to Articles 1174 and
 1262 of the New Civil Code, liability attaches even if the loss was due
 to a fortuitous event if âthe nature of the obligation requires the 
assumption of riskâ.
[14]
 
Carnapping is a normal business risk for those engaged in the repair of 
motor vehicles. For just as the owner is exposed to that risk so is the 
repair shop since the car was entrusted to it. That is why, repair shops
 are required to first register with the Department of Trade and 
Industry (DTI)
[15]
 and to 
secure an insurance policy for the âshop covering the property entrusted
 by its customer for repair, service or maintenanceâ as a pre-requisite 
for such registration/accreditation.
[16]
 Violation of this statutory duty constitutes negligence 
per se
.
[17]

 Having taken custody of the vehicle, private respondent is obliged not 
only to repair the vehicle but must also provide the customer with some 
form of security for his property over which he loses immediate control.
 An owner who cannot exercise the seven (7) juses or attributes of 
ownership â the right to possess, to use and enjoy, to abuse or consume,
 to accessories, to dispose or alienate, to recover or vindicate and to 
the fruits -
[18]
 is a crippled
 owner. Failure of the repair shop to provide security to a motor 
vehicle owner would leave the latter at the mercy of the former. 
Moreover, on the assumption that private respondentâs repair business is
 duly registered, it presupposes that its shop is covered by insurance 
from which it may recover the loss. If private respondent can recover 
from its insurer, then it would be unjustly enriched if it will not 
compensate petitioner to whom no fault can be attributed. Otherwise, if 
the shop is not registered, then the presumption of negligence applies.

One last thing. With respect to the value of the lost vehicle and
 its accessories for which the repair shop is liable, it should be based
 on the fair market value that the property would command at the time it
 was entrusted to it or such other value as agreed upon by the parties 
subsequent to the loss. Such recoverable value is fair and reasonable 
considering that the value of the vehicle depreciates. This value may be
 recovered without prejudice to such other damages that a claimant is 
entitled under applicable laws.

 The dispositive portion of the trial courtâs decision reads:

âAccordingly, this Court finds the defendant liable to the 
plaintiff for the value of the vehicle in question. Defendant is ordered
 to pay plaintiff the value of the vehicle in the amount of Three 
Hundred Thirty Two Thousand Five Hundred Pesos representing the 
acquisition cost of the vehicle plus the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos
 representing the cost of the four brand new tires, magwheels, pioneer 
stereo, speakers, air-conditioner, which were installed by the plaintiff
 in his vehicle after the plaintiff bought the vehicle from the 
defendant. While it is true that plaintiff purchased from the defendant 
the vehicle about two years and five months before the same was lost, 
and therefore the vehicle had already depreciated from its original 
value at the time it was lost, it is also true as agreed upon by the 
parties in the pre-trial, that the present value of a brand new vehicle 
of the same type has at this time increased to Four Hundred Thousand 
Pesos without accessories, so whatever is awarded by this Court to the 
plaintiff in this decision would not even be sufficient to purchase a 
brand new vehicle at the present prices. This Court believes that the 
amount awarded to the plaintiff above-stated represents a fair 
compromise, considering the depreciation of the vehicle from the time it
 was purchased and to the time it was lost and which is off-seated by 
the increase cost of a brand new vehicle at the present time. Defendant 
is likewise ordered to pay plaintiff legal interest in the amount 
above-stated from the date of the finality of this decision until full 
payment of the obligation. Further, defendant is ordered to pay 
plaintiff Ten Thousand Pesos by attorneyâs fees.â (sic was not included

Products, Inc. v. Teodoro, 26 SCRA 332. In the Bergado case (p. 501), 
the court reiterated the rule that the specific exceptions to the 
general rule to be observed in pre-trials emphasized in Gicano v. 
Gegato, 157 SCRA 140 is âthat trial courts have authority and discretion
 to dismiss an action on the ground of prescription when the partiesâ 
pleadings or other facts on record show it to be indeed time-barred; and
 it may do so on the basis of a motion to dismiss, or an answer which 
sets up such ground as an affirmative defense; or even if the ground is 
alleged after judgment on the merits, as in a motion for 
reconsideration; or even if the defense has not been asserted at all, as
 where no statement thereof is found in the pleadings, or where a 
defendant had been declared in default. What is essential only, to 
repeat, is that the facts demonstrating the lapse of the prescriptive 
period, be otherwise sufficiently and satisfactorily apparent on the 
record; either in the averments of the plaintiffâs, or otherwise 
established by the evidence."
