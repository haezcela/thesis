JOSE ABACA, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ J.:


Petitioner Jose Abaca was tried before the Regional Trial Court 
of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, for the crime of illegal recruitment under
 Article 38 and 39 of Presidential Decree No. 442, based on an 
Information which reads:



"That in the month of November 1988, and for a period prior and/or 
subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of Calapan, Province of Oriental
 Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused thru false manifestation and fraudulent 
representation made to ROSELIA JIZ JANEO, ZENAIDA J. SUBANG, RENITA J. 
JANEO and MELROSE S. PALOMO to the effect that he has the authority to 
recruit workers for employment in Taipei, Taiwan, and can facilitate the
 processing of their necessary papers in connection therewith if given 
the necessary amount of money to cover the costs of such recruitment and
 by means of other similar deceit when in truth and in fact he is not 
authorized nor licensed to recruit, did then and there willfully and 
unlawfully, and feloniously collect from the aforestated applicants the 
aggregate amount of FOURTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P 14,000.00), Philippine 
Currency, the said accused assuring and representing that the same would
 be used in defraying the necessary expenses of the complainants' 
application for employment abroad and having been convinced by said 
misrepresentation the complainants gave the said amount to the herein 
accused, but the latter far from complying with his obligations, 
misappropriated and converted to his own personal use and benefit the 
aforecited amount, to the damage and prejudice of the said ROSELIA JIZ 
JANEO, ZENAIDA J. SUBANG, RENITA J.JANEO and MELROSE S. PALOMO. 


Contrary to Articles 38 and 39 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines."
[1]






Arraigned on February 6, 1990, petitioner entered a plea of not guilty. Thereafter, trial ensued.

The prosecution's evidence, as summarized by the trial court, reads as follows:



"The gist of the testimonies of the four complainants revolves on 
how the accused (petitioner herein) recruited them to work abroad and 
made them believe that the accused could work out their papers in 
consideration of a certain sum of money. Specifically, the four 
complainants similarly testified that the accused was introduced to them
 by his brothers, Perferio and Guding Abaca, whom they already knew for a
 long time. Sometime in the month of November 1988, the accused, 
accompanied by his brothers, misrepresented himself to be a licensed 
recruiter and convinced the four complainants that for a consideration 
they could work abroad at Taipei either as a domestic helper or factory 
worker with a salary ranging from $300 to $500 a month. The accused 
asked the sum of P14,000.00 each, but the complainants requested if they
 could pay P6,000.00 first and before departure they will complete the 
amount as demanded. Thus, the complainants paid partial amount at the 
office of the accused at Five Ace Philippines located in Manila and all 
of them gave their own down payment. Each complainant paid the accused 
P1,500.00 allegedly to be used for the processing of the passport and 
the following amounts for processing x x x 


'All the complainants were able to receive the passport from the accused.
  


'From the foregoing, the complainants were able to pay the accused 
the aggregate amount of P14,000.00, excluding the amount of P1,500.00 
each for the passport.
  


'It was agreed between the complainant and the accused that the 
balance of their obligation would be given on or before they leave for 
abroad. But since their payment, the accused promised them to leave, 
first, on or before December, 1988 and then anytime in January of 1989, 
and then later. When the complainants sensed that they would not leave 
anymore, they informed the brothers of the accused whom they are 
familiar with, complaining about the failure of the accused to send them
 abroad when they have already paid the advance payment. The two 
brothers could not do otherwise but appeased them and promised to 
contact their brother, the accused herein. Finally, the complainants 
were able to confront the accused and demanded the return of their 
money, but the accused merely promised to do so, until such time that 
they already filed their complaint with the NBI."
  




On the other hand, petitionerâs version of the case is likewise capsulized by the trial court in this wise, viz:



"In trying to absolve himself from criminal liability, the accused 
shifted the blame to a certain Mr. Reynaldo Tan to whom he alleges to 
have remitted the sums of money he received from the complainants. To 
corroborate his version of the incident, the accused presented one 
Alberto Tolentino, an employee of the Department of Public Works and 
Highways who also was recruited by Mr. Abaca and who was also referred 
to Mr. Reynaldo Tan. 


xxx                                    xxx                                          xxx
  


When asked if he recruited complainants as they testified in Court,
 the accused denied the truth of such statement. The accused stated that
 he did not recruit them and the truth was he happened to be at the 
establishment of complainants in Calapan and they were able to talk with
 the Janeo sisters who told them of their problems wherein they were 
notified to vacate the establishment, and thus asked the accused to 
assist them in going abroad. The accused told them that they were 
recruiting workers in the Middle East but he is discouraging female to 
work there because of the horrible experiences others have undergone. 
The accused also told them that he was referring them to somebody whom 
he knows are sending people to Taipei in the person of Mr. Reynaldo Tan.
 The complainants agreed, after which the accused left for Manila where 
he was working. Then, one morning, the two girls in the name of Melrose 
Paloma and Zenaida Subang called the accused by phone and told him that 
they are interested in joining the Janeo sister to go to Taipei and they
 said that they came across the calling card of the accused marked as 
Exhibit "G". He admitted that the Five Ace Philippines is only engaged 
in trading and not as recruitment agency. He informed the Court that he 
was connected with the recruitment agency called WORK Incorporated-a 
licensed company."
  




After trial, judgment was rendered finding petitioner guilty of the crime charged, the dispositive portion of which reads:



"WHEREFORE, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
the crime of illegal recruitment under Art. 39 ( c ) of P.D. 442, he is 
hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of four (4 ) years straight and 
to indemnify the complainants the aggregate amount of P14, 000.00 by way
 of civil liability, with the legal rate of interest from 1988 up to the
 time of payment. 


SO ORDERED."
  




On appeal, the respondent Court of Appeals affirmed with modification
 the decision of the trial court. It found petitioner guilty of illegal 
recruitment on a large-scale and sentenced him to life imprisonment and a
 fine of P100,000.00.
[2]


Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the same was denied on November 7, 1996.
[3]


Petitioner now comes to us alleging that the respondent court 
committed grave and reversible errors of law and/or acted with grave 
abuse of discretion-

In not considering the certification (Exh. 1) issued by the POEA 
stating, among others, that WORK, Inc. was a duly licensed private 
recruitment agency prior to August 20,1989, and that petitioner was then
 a manager and PDOS (Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar) Trainor in said 
recruitment agency, and that, therefore, by virtue of his position as 
manager and PDOS trainor of WORK, Inc. , he had the authority to 
undertake recruitment activities. 
 In not finding that petitioner, being a holder of authority, may 
not be validly charged of illegal recruitment as defined by law in force
 at the time of the alleged commission of the offense charged, much 
less, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
 In declaring petitioner guilty of illegal recruitment in large 
scale and sentencing him to a penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a 
fine of P100,000.00 
 In finding that herein petitioner undertook recruitment activities, there being a grave misapprehension of the facts. 


The petition must be dismissed.

The crime of illegal recruitment is committed when two elements 
concur, namely: (1) the offender has no valid license or authority 
required by law to enable one to lawfully engage in recruitment and 
placement of workers; and (2) he undertakes either any activity within 
the meaning of "recruitment and placement" defined under Article 13(b), 
or any prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor 
Code. 
[4]


Under the first element, a 
nonlicensee
 or 
nonholder of authority

 is any person, corporation or entity which has not been issued a valid 
license or authority to engage in recruitment and placement by the 
Secretary of Labor, or whose license or authority has been suspended, 
revoked or canceled by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration
 (POEA) or the Secretary.
[5]
 
Agents or representatives appointed by a licensee or a holder of 
authority but whose appointments are not previously authorized by POEA 
are within the meaning of the term 
nonlicensee
 or 
nonholder of authority
.
[6]


The record shows that petitioner is not a licensed recruiter as evidenced by the Certification
[7]

 issued by Mr. Hermogenes C. Mateo, Chief of the Licensing Branch, POEA.
 Testifying on the aforesaid certification, Mr. Mateo said:



"Q    Now, how about a person by the name of Jose Abaca alias "Joe"
 or Jose "Joe" Abaca listed in that particular list as one among those 
authorized by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration to 
recruit workers for employment abroad? 


A      He is not included among those authorized to recruit in their personal capacity like single proprietorship, sir."
[8]






Petitioner's theory that he has the authority to recruit by reason of
 his position as manager and Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar Trainor 
(PDOS) of the WORKERS FOR OVERSEAS RECRUITMENT KEY CENTER, INC. (WORK, 
Inc.), a licensed private recruitment agency is devoid of merit. The 
Certification
[9]
 issued by Mr.
 Mateo, which was relied upon by petitioner is nothing but an 
affirmation that he is an officer of WORK, Inc. It does not, in any way,
 prove that petitioner has a license or authority to undertake 
recruitment activities. Moreover, his employment with a licensed 
placement agency does not 
ipso facto
 authorize him to recruit workers. This was clarified by Mr. Mateo when he testified that: 



"Q    Now, will you please tell this Court if the employees of 
WORK, Incorporated in particular or any agency for that matter which are
 license to recruit workers for overseas employment authorized or 
licensed to recruit workers for employment abroad? 


xxx        xxx        xxx
  


A      That will depend on the designation of the person concerned, sir.
  


FISCAL SENOREN:
  


Q     What do you mean by it depends upon the designation of a person?
  


A      Well, if the designation states for example that he is only 
authorized to market for overseas principal, that is the only function 
that he could do so in representing the company. For example, if he is 
trainor, it so states that he is authorized to serve as trainor in the 
conduct of pre-departure orientation seminar, sir.
  


xxx        xxx        xxx
  


Q     When a person is trainor or only a personnel manager, do you mean to say that he cannot recruit for his agency?
  


A      As far as the POEA is concerned, we only recognize the 
appointment submitted to our office in his capacity as that, Your 
Honor." 
[10]






Even assuming that WORK, Inc. had authorized petitioner, by reason of
 his position in the company, to recruit workers, still, such authority 
was not previously approved by the POEA.
[11]


Again, Mr. Mateo explained that a licensee or holder of authority
 may authorize their employees to recruit for the agency. However, said 
authority must be submitted to and approved by the POEA.
[12]
 The provision of Article 29 of the Labor Code is very clear on this:



"Art. 29. 
Non-transferability of license or authority
.- No
 license or authority shall be used directly or indirectly by any person
 other than the one in whose favor it was issued or at any place other 
than stated in the license or authority, nor may such license or 
authority be transferred, conveyed or assigned to any other person or 
entity. 
Any transfer of business address, appointment or designation 
of any agent or representative including the establishment of additional
 officers anywhere shall be subject to the prior approval of the 
Department of Labor
." (Underlining Ours) 




Moreover, there is nothing from the record which would show even by 
implication that petitioner was acting for and in behalf of WORK, Inc. 
when he was dealing with the complainants. Petitioner gave his calling 
card 
[13]
 and met with private complainants at his office at Five Ace, Phil., Malate, City of Manila. 

Thus, complainant Roselia Janeo testified:



"Q    Where did you give the amount of P 1,500.00 for your passport? 


A      I give (sic) the amount of P1,500.00 to Jose Abaca in Manila because he instructed us to follow him in Manila.
  


Q     Where in Manila did you give that P1,500.00?
  


A      At Five Ace Philippines and this Five Ace Philippines is the agency which according to Jose Abaca he is handling"
[14]






Complainant Reneta Janeo also testified:



"Q Miss witness, where did you give the amount of P6,000.00 to Mr. Jose Abaca? 


A   At Five Ace Philippines, sir.
  


Q  What is this Five Ace Philippines?
  


A   It is an office, sir.
  


Q  And where is this Five Ace Philippines located?
  


A   At Guerero corner J. Nakpil St., Malate, sir. "
[15]






Petitioner's testimony that he referred the private complainants to a
 certain Reynaldo Tan because WORK, Inc. is deploying workers to the 
Middle East and other countries with bilateral agreements with the 
Philippines undisputably show that he was not representing WORK, Inc. 
when he dealt with private complainants. Petitioner recounted:



"Q If that is so, Mr. Witness, why do you have to refer the 
complainants to other company represented by Mr. Reynaldo Tan, if 
according to you, the WORK Incorporated was duly licensed to engage in 
recruitment business? 


A   Well, as I have said that I did not want them to be deployed to
 the Middle East wherein we have authority to deploy to the Middle East.
 Now, the fact that we do not have a bilateral agreement with Taipei but
 the Taipei government is accepting employees from the Philippines on a 
tourist visa and a tourist passport and visitors visa and as matter of 
fact, we have no less than two hundred thousand Filipino workers in 
Taipei right now under a visitor's visa on a tourist passport.
  


Q  So your company is not engaged in sending workers for Taipei, Taiwan" I am referring to WORK Incorporated? 


A   Yes, sir.
  


Q  Because, according to you, our government has no diplomatic relation.
  


A   Bilateral agreement, sir.
  


Q  Bilateral agreement with said country?
  


A   Because the papers to be processed by the POEA, that cannot be 
processed because our government has no bilateral agreement with the 
said country.
  


Q  And you want to impress upon this Court that all workers going 
to Taipei, Taiwan work there unofficially without the sanction of our 
government but on shall we say, unofficial capacity, am I right?
  


A   Yes, unofficially in our country because they are working there
 on a tourist visa. And that is not the problem of our country. This is 
the problem of the once accepting these people. Even a tourist visa, a 
tourist passport.
  


Q  
So that is the reason , according to you, why you do not 
utilize your company, the WORK Incorporated in connection with this 
particular application of the complainants in going to Taipei, Taiwan?
 


A   Yes, sir."
[16]
 (Underlining Ours)
  




It is clear therefore that petitioner never acted for and in behalf of WORK, Inc. when he recruited the private complainants.

Going now to the second element of the crime charged, that is, 
the offender undertakes either any activity within the meaning of 
recruitment and placement, Article 13(b) of the Labor Code defines "
recruitment and placement
," as follows:



"Recruitment and placement refers to 
any act of canvassing,
 enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring 
workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or 
advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or 
not;
 Provided, that any person or entity which in any manner 
offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be 
deemed engaged in recruitment and placement."(Underscoring Supplied) 




Petitioner's acts of (1) representing to the private complainants 
that he can help them work in Taipei with a monthly salary of $300 to 
$500; (2) requiring them to submit their ID pictures, birth certificates
 and bio-data for their employment abroad; (3) demanding from them 
P12,000.00 as processing fee; and (4) receiving from them certain 
amounts for the processing of their passports and other papers, are all 
recruitment activities within the contemplation of the law. 

The finding of the trial court in this regard is worth noting:



"It has already been shown by the prosecution that accused was not 
licensed or authorized by the POEA to recruit workers for abroad. And 
yet, despite such fact, accused, thru false manifestation and fraudulent
 representation, made the complainants believe that he could help them 
work abroad as household helper or factory worker at Taipei at a salary 
ranging from $300 to $500, alleging that he has a friend who could help 
them work abroad. Relying on this representation, complainants were 
constrained to pay the aggregate amount of P14,000.00 as demanded by the
 accused besides the P1,500.00 each for passport, and the accused issued
 a private receipt (not official or printed receipt) evidencing such 
payment. With these receipts marked as Exhibits "A" to "E", "H" and "I" 
and the issuance of the passport, ID pictures, birth certificate, 
bio-data and other personal papers, the complainants were led to believe
 that accused could really help them work abroad. Thus, after payment, 
accused assured complainants that they might be able to leave in 
December of 1988. Come December 1988 and yet complainants were not able 
to leave and was again promised by accused that they could leave the 
following month of January, 1989. Again, complainants failed to leave, 
thus, they demanded from the accused to return the money, otherwise, 
they would file a case against the accused in court."
[17]






Petitioner further asserted that he did not recruit private complainants but only tried to help them by 
referring

 them to one Reynaldo Tan who was allegedly licensed to recruit workers 
to Taiwan. This posture, unfortunately will not exculpate him. 
Petitioner's act of referring private complainants to Tan is, under the 
law, also considered a recruitment activity.

Finally, petitioner faults respondent court in finding him guilty of illegal recruitment 
in large scale

 which has a higher penalty. He argues that he cannot be convicted of 
illegal recruitment in large scale because the information charged him 
only with simple illegal recruitment. Having been sentenced by the 
respondent court to a graver offense, petitioner claims that he was 
deprived of his constitutional right to be informed of the true nature 
and cause of the accusation against him.

We do not agree.

The real nature of the criminal charge is determined not from the
 technical name given by the fiscal appearing in the title of the 
information but by the actual recital of facts appearing in the 
complaint or information.
[18]


Thus, where the allegations in the information clearly sets forth the 
essential elements

 of the crime charged, the constitutional right of the accused to be 
informed of the nature and cause of his accusations is not violated.
[19]


The information against petitioner has clearly recited all the 
elements of the crime of illegal recruitment at large scale, namely: 



the offender is a non-licensee or non-holder of authority to engage in recruitment and placement activity, 
the offender undertakes recruitment and placement activity defined
 under Article 13 (b), or any prohibited practices enumerated under 
Article 34, and 
illegal recruitment is committed against three or more persons individually or as a group.
[20]






All these elements were duly proven by the prosecution. Petitioner, 
as discussed earlier, is not licensed or authorized to recruit overseas 
workers; he undertook recruitment activities defined under Article 34 
under the Labor Code and he recruited the four (4) complainant-workers, 
thus making the crime illegal recruitment in large scale. The imposable 
penalty is life imprisonment and a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos 
(P100,000.00) pursuant to Article 38 (b)
[21]
 and Article 39 (a)
[22]
 of the Labor Code.
