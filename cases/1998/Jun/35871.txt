ZOSIMO M. DIMAANDAL, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT. 
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


This petition for certiorari seeks the reversal of the decision of the Commission on Audit dated September 7, 1995,
[1]
 the dispositive portion of which reads, to wit:



âForegoing premises considered, the instant appeal cannot be given 
due course. Accordingly, the disallowance in question in the total 
amount of P52,908.00 is hereby affirmed. Considering that the claim for 
the RATA differential in the amount of P8,400.00 is devoid of any legal 
basis, the same is also disallowed. Hence, appellant Zosimo M. Dimaandal
 is hereby directed to refund the salary and RATA differential in the 
amount of P61,308.00 he had received from the Provincial Government of 
Batangas.â
[2]






The undisputed facts:

On November 23, 1992, petitioner Zosimo M. Dimaandal, then 
holding the position of Supply Officer III, was designated Acting 
Assistant Provincial Treasurer for Administration by then Governor 
Vicente A. Mayo of Batangas. Pursuant to the designation, petitioner 
filed a claim for the difference in salary and Representation and 
Transportation Allowance (RATA) of Assistant Provincial Treasurer and 
Supply Officer III for the whole year of 1993 in the total amount of 
P61,308.00.

However, the Provincial Auditor disallowed in audit P52,908.00 of
 the claim. What was allowed was only the amount of P8,400.00 which 
corresponds to the difference in the allowances attached to the 
designation and the position occupied by the appellant. The disallowance
 was premised on the following reasons:



â1. The provisions of Section 2077 of the Revised Administrative 
Code is not applicable in the instant case as the power to fill the 
position of Assistant Provincial Treasurer rests on the Secretary of 
Finance. 


2. The designation is temporary in nature and does not amount to 
the issuance of an appointment as could entitle the designee to receive 
the salary of the position to which he is designated (Opinion of the 
Director, Office for Legal Affairs, Civil Service Commission dated 
January 25, 1994).â
  




On August 3, 1994, Governor Mayo wrote to the Provincial Auditor 
requesting reconsideration of the subject disallowance, interposing the 
following reasons:



â1. That Section 2077 of the Revised Administrative Code is 
applicable in the instant case as the same provides that the Governor 
General or the officer having the power to fill-up a temporary absence 
or disability in the provincial office has the power to order or 
authorize payment of compensation to any government officer or employee 
designated or appointed temporarily to fill the place; 


2. That the budget containing an appropriation for the position of 
Assistant Provincial Treasurer for Administration was already approved 
by the Provincial Board; and
  


3. That Mr. Dimaandal at the time of his designation as Acting 
Provincial Treasurer for Administration was no longer performing the 
duties and functions of Supply Officer III."
  




The Provincial Auditor, however, denied the request for 
reconsideration. Appellant was required to refund the amount of 
P52,908.00 which was disallowed.

Petitioner appealed to the respondent Commission on Audit which 
sustained the stand of the Provincial Auditor of Batangas as valid and 
proper. The respondent Commission was of the view that the petitioner 
was merely designated as an Assistant Provincial Treasurer for 
Administration in addition to his regular duties. As such, he is not 
entitled to receive an additional salary. The Commission further opined 
that petitioner was likewise not entitled to receive the difference in 
RATA provided for under the Local Budget Circular issued by the 
Department of Budget and Management considering that the party 
designating him to such position is not the âduly competent authority,â 
provided for under Section 471 of the Local Government Code. Notably, 
petitioner was appointed as Assistant Provincial Treasurer for 
Administration by the Secretary of Finance only on July 8, 1994.

Thus, the respondent Commission not only affirmed the 
disallowance of the amount of P52,908.00 but likewise disallowed the 
claim for the RATA differential in the amount of P8,400.00, for being 
devoid of any legal basis. Petitioner was, therefore, directed to refund
 the salary and RATA differential in the amount of P61,308.00. 

Hence, this petition.

The issue here is whether or not an employee who is designated in
 an acting capacity is entitled to the difference in salary between his 
regular position and the higher position to which he is designated.

Petitioner avers that the respondent Commissionâs decision is 
âprobably not in accordance with applicable decisions of the Supreme 
Court.â
[3]
 He cites the cases of Cui, et. al. vs. Ortiz, et. al.,
[4]
 April 29, 1960; and, Menzon vs. Petilla, May 20, 1991,
[5]

 which laid down the rule that de facto officers are entitled to salary 
for services actually rendered. Petitioner contends that he may be 
considered as a de facto officer by reason of services rendered in favor
 of the Province of Batangas. He then posits the view that to disallow 
his compensation and in the process allow the Province of Batangas to 
keep and enjoy the benefits derived from his services actually rendered 
would be tantamount to deprivation of property without due process of 
law, and impairment of obligation of contracts duly enshrined in the 
Constitution.

On the other hand, the respondent Commission, through the Office 
of the Solicitor General, maintains that the decisions cited by 
petitioner do not find application in petitionerâs case. In the case of 
Menzon, what was extended was an appointment to the vacant position of 
Vice-Governor. Here, what was extended to petitioner was not an 
appointment but a mere designation. Thus, the nature of petitionerâs 
designation and in the absence of authority of the Governor to authorize
 the payment of the additional salary and RATA without the appropriate 
resolution from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan does not make the ruling on
 de facto officers applicable in this case.

We find the petition to be without merit.

We are not persuaded by petitionerâs insistence that he could 
still claim the salary and RATA differential because he actually 
performed the functions pertaining to the office of Acting Assistant 
Provincial Treasurer and, therefore, entitled to the salary and benefits
 attached to it despite the fact that the Governor of Batangas had no 
authority to designate him to the said position.

The law applicable is Section 471(a) of RA 7160 otherwise known as the Local Government Code which mandates that:



â
Sec. 471. Assistant Treasurers
. - (a) An 
assistant treasurer may be appointed by the Secretary of Finance from a 
list of at least three (3) ranking eligible recommendees of the governor
 or mayor, subject to civil service law, rules and regulations.
  


xxx                                                 
                                                xxx                     
       xxx 
  




In fact, the appointing officer is authorized by law to order the 
payment of compensation to any government officer or employee designated
 or appointed to fill such vacant position, as provided under Section 
2077 of the Revised Administrative Code which states that:



"
Section 2077. Compensation for person appointed to temporary service
.
  


xxx                                                 
                                                          xxx           
                       xxx
  


âIn case of the temporary absence or disability of a provincial 
officer or in case of a vacancy in a provincial office, the President of
 the Philippines or officer having the power to fill such position may, 
in his discretion, order the payment of compensation, or additional 
compensation, to any Government officer or employee designated or 
appointed temporarily to fill the place, but the total compensation paid
 shall not exceed the salary authorized by law for the position filled.â
  




Undoubtedly, the aforecited laws do not authorize the Provincial 
Governor to appoint nor even designate one temporarily in cases of 
temporary absence or disability or a vacancy in a provincial office. 
That power resides in the President of the Philippines or the Secretary 
of Finance.

Necessarily, petitionerâs designation as Assistant Provincial 
Treasurer for Administration by Governor Mayo being defective, confers 
no right on the part of petitioner to claim the difference in the 
salaries and allowances attached to the position occupied by him.

Moreover, what was extended to petitioner by Governor Mayo was 
merely a designation not an appointment. The respondent Commission 
clearly pointed out the difference between an appointment and 
designation, thus:



âThere is a great difference between an appointment and 
designation. While an appointment is the selection by the proper 
authority of an individual who is to exercise the powers and functions 
of a given office, designation merely connotes an imposition of 
additional duties, usually by law, upon a person already in the public 
service by virtue of an earlier appointment (Santiago vs. COA, 199 SCRA 
125). 


âDesignation is simply the mere imposition of new or additional 
duties on the officer or employee to be performed by him in a special 
manner. It does not entail payment of additional benefits or grant upon 
the person so designated the right to claim the salary attached to the 
position (COA Decision No. 95-087 dated February 2, 1995). As such, 
there being no appointment issued, designation does not entitle the 
officer designated to receive the salary of the position. For the legal 
basis of an employeeâs right to claim the salary attached thereto is a 
duly issued and approved appointment to the position (Opinion dated 
January 25, 1994 of the Office for Legal Affairs, Civil Service 
Commission, Re: Evora, Carlos, A. Jr., Designation).â
[6]






This Court has time and again ruled that:



âAlthough technically not binding and controlling on the courts, 
the construction given by the agency or entity charged with the 
enforcement of a statute should be given great weight and respect (In re
 Allen, 2 Phil. 630, 640), particularly so if such construction, as in 
the case at bar, has been uniform, and consistent, and has been observed
 and acted on for a long period of time (Molina vs. Rafferty, 38 Phil. 
167; Madrigal vs. Rafferty, 38 Phil. 414; Philippine Sugar Central vs. 
Collector of Customs, 51 Phil. 143).â
[7]






We see no justifiable reason to sustain petitionerâs argument that 
non-payment of his salary differential and RATA would be a violation of 
his constitutional right against deprivation of property without due 
process of law and the non-impairment of obligation of contracts clause 
in the Constitution.

The right to the salary of an Assistant Provincial Treasurer is 
based on the assumption that the appointment or designation thereof was 
made in accordance with law. Considering that petitionerâs designation 
was without color of authority, the right to the salary or an allowance 
due from said office never existed. Stated differently, in the absence 
of such right, there can be no violation of any constitutional right nor
 an impairment of the obligation of contracts clause under the 
Constitution.

The nature of petitionerâs designation and the absence of 
authority of the Governor to authorize the payment of the additional 
salary and RATA without the appropriate resolution from the Sangguniang 
Panlalawigan does not make him a de facto officer.

A de facto officer is defined as one who derives his appointment 
from one having colorable authority to appoint, if the office is an 
appointive office, and whose appointment is valid on its face. It is 
likewise defined as one who is in possession of an office, and is 
discharging its duties under color of authority, by which is meant 
authority derived from an appointment, however irregular or informal, so
 that the incumbent be not a mere volunteer.
[8]

 Then a de facto officer is one who is in possession of an office in the
 open exercise of its functions under color of an election or an 
appointment, even though such election or appointment may be irregular.
[9]


Petitioner invokes in his favor the ruling in 
Menzon vs. Petilla
,
[10]
 that a de facto officer is entitled to receive the salary for services actually rendered. However, his reliance on the 
Menzon
 case is misplaced. In 
Menzon
,
 what was extended was an appointment to the vacant position of 
Vice-Governor, in petitionerâs case, he was designated. The appointment 
of Menzon had the color of validity. This Court said:



âAnd finally, even granting that the President, acting through the 
Secretary of Local Government, possesses no power to appoint the 
petitioner, at the very least, the petitioner is a de facto officer 
entitled to compensation. There is no denying that the petitioner 
assumed the Office of the Vice-Governor under a color of a known 
appointment. As revealed by the records, the petitioner was appointed by
 no less than the alter ego of the President, The Secretary of Local 
Government, after which he took his oath of office before Senator 
Alberto Romulo in the Office of Department of Local Government Regional 
Director Res Salvatierra. Concededly, the appointment has the color of 
validity.â
  




Likewise, the doctrine in 
Cui
, et. al. vs. Ortiz, et. al.
[11]
 does not apply in petitionerâs case. In Cui, this Court held:



âPetitionersâ appointments on December 1 and 12, 1955 by the then 
mayor of the municipality were legal and in order, the appointing mayor 
still in possession of his right to appoint. For such appointments to be
 complete, the approval of the President of the Philippines is required.
 The law provides that pending approval of said appointment by the 
President, the appointee may assume office and receive salary for 
services actually rendered. Accordingly, therefore, in that duration 
until the appointment is finally acted upon favorably or unfavorably, 
the appointees may be considered as âde factoâ officers and entitled to 
salaries for services actually rendered.â
  




Finally, the appointment signed by Finance Undersecretary Juanita D. 
Amatong is dated July 8, 1994. Petitionerâs claim that the appointment 
retro-acts to his assumption of office is not confirmed by the express 
phraseology of the appointment itself, which states:



âKayo ay nahirang na 
ASSISTANT PROVINCIAL TREASURER FOR ADMINISTRATION
 na may katayuang 
PERMANENT
 sa 
OFFICE OF THE PROVINCIAL TREASURER OF BATANGAS
 sa pasahod na 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY (P121,620.00) P.A.

 piso. Ito ay magkakabisa sa petsa ng pagganap ng tungkulin subalit di 
aaga sa petsa ng pagpirma ng puno ng tanggapan o appointing authority.â
[12]






The subsequent appointment of petitioner to the position on July 8, 
1994, cannot justify petitionerâs retention of the excess amount of 
P61,308.00, which corresponds to the amount disallowed and ordered 
refunded by COA representing the salary and RATA in excess of what was 
due him in 1993.
