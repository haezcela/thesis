May a complaint for damages arising from an alleged premature 
foreclosure of mortgage, with prayer for a writ of preliminary 
injunction, be dismissed on the ground that the foreclosure sought to be
 enjoined is already a 
fait accompli
?

On 12 November 1991 private respondent Romeo Barilea filed a 
complaint for damages with the Regional Trial Court of Negros Occidental
 with a prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and 
writ of preliminary injunction against petitioner Philippine National 
Bank (PNB) and the Provincial Sheriff of Negros Occidental.

The complaint alleged that: defendant Barilea (private respondent
 herein) obtained sugar crop loans with petitioner at its Victoria 
Branch to finance his sugarcane plantation in Sagay, Negros Occidental; 
he was granted a crop loan of P208,300.00 and, thereafter, another loan 
of P40,000.00 which would fall due on 31 August 1991 and 31 August 1992,
 respectively; the crop loans were secured by a mortgage on Barileaâs 
parcel of land with an area of 2,804 square meters and covered by 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-12217 of the Register of Deeds of 
Cadiz City. Private respondent also alleged that on 29 September 1991, 
while he was harvesting and cutting canes for the purpose of milling the
 same, petitioner filed a petition for the sale of the mortgaged 
property under Act No. 3135 as amended with the Provincial Sheriff of 
Negros Occidental, and that, consequently, on 7 October 1991 the latter 
issued a Notice of Extrajudicial Sale by public auction of private 
respondentâs property on 18 November 1991. 

The complaint further stated that in October 1991 private 
respondent had partially harvested and milled his sugarcane at a sugar 
central after which quedans were prepared; that when private respondent 
was about to withdraw the quedans, he was informed that they were taken 
by petitioner. Private respondent contended that in filing the petition 
for the sale of the mortgaged property with the provincial sheriff, 
petitioner acted with malice and bad faith in order to embarrass him; 
that the petition was premature because the crop loans had not yet 
fallen due; and, that because of petitionerâs malicious acts in filing 
the petition, private respondent suffered sleepless nights, mental 
torture, anxiety, public humiliation and public ridicule, thus entitling
 him to moral and exemplary damages in addition to the actual expenses 
incurred for which petitioner should be ordered to pay. Private 
respondent also prayed for the issuance of a temporary restraining order
 and writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin petitioner and the 
Provincial Sheriff from conducting the sale by public auction scheduled 
on 18 November 1991.
[1]


Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, petitioner filed on 17 January 1991 a motion to dismiss
[2]

 alleging that: petitioner had not acted maliciously and prematurely in 
filing the petition for foreclosure of mortgage; private respondent was 
granted four (4) loan accomodations by petitioner three (3) of which had
 already fallen due; because of the past due accounts of private 
respondent petitioner had the right to institute foreclosure 
proceedings; and, the other reliefs prayed for by private respondent, 
i.e., issuance of a restraining order and writ of preliminary 
injunction, had been rendered moot and academic by the holding of the 
auction sale on 7 November 1991.

On 18 February 1992 private respondent filed an amended complaint
 increasing the amounts prayed for as moral damages and attorneyâs fees.

On 10 March 1992 the trial court issued an order dismissing the 
case for being moot and academic because the sale sought to be enjoined 
had already been conducted on 7 November 1991.
[3]
 The motion for reconsideration by private respondent was denied.

Private respondent appealed the order of dismissal to the Court of Appeals. In its decision
[4]

 of 28 June 1995, the Court of Appeals set aside the order dismissing 
the case. The appellate court found that the complaint of private 
respondent sought the payment of moral and exemplary damages on the 
ground that petitioner was actuated with malice and bad faith in filing 
the petition with the sheriff for the sale of the mortgaged property 
even if the crop loan of P40,000.00 had not yet matured. It also ruled 
that the issuance of a temporary restraining order and a writ of 
preliminary injunction was only a provisional remedy, and consequently, 
the foreclosure sale on 7 November 1991 did not render the case moot 
since the principal action for payment of damages still had to be 
litigated. The Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the trial 
court for proper proceedings.

Hence this petition alleging that the Court of Appeals 
erroneously failed to hold that (a) the dismissal of the case by the 
trial court was justified after it had become moot and academic with the
 foreclosure sale; (b) denial of the ancillary remedy of temporary 
restraining order was proper; and, (c) the foreclosure of the mortgage 
was valid in view of the contract between the parties and conformably 
with the mandatory requirements of PD No. 385.

The principal issue to be resolved is whether the complaint for 
damages based on the foreclosure of mortgage should now be dismissed in 
view of the foreclosure sale. The other issues raised by petitioner, 
i.e., whether the foreclosure sale was valid, and whether the claim of 
private respondent for damages was proper, are factual matters well 
within the domain of the trial court - and not of this Court.

The petition must fail. The Court of Appeals was correct in 
ruling that the dismissal of the complaint of private respondent by the 
trial court was not valid.

In a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint states no
 cause of action, the question to be resolved by the trial court is 
whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to constitute a
 cause of action and not whether the allegations of fact are true as the
 latter are hypothetically admitted.
[5]

 Hence, a complaint sufficiently states a cause of action when the 
following questions are answered in the affirmative: (a) Does the 
complaint show the plaintiff has suffered an injury? (b) Is it an injury
 which the law recognizes as a wrong and for which it provides a remedy?
 (c) Is the defendant liable for the alleged wrong done? and, (d) If the
 defendant is liable, is there a legal remedy for such injury?
[6]


Applying these criteria to the complaint of private respondent, 
the same alleged facts are sufficient to state a cause of action for 
damages. The complaint alleged that private respondent suffered actual 
expenses, moral anxiety and public humiliation, among others, as a 
result of the alleged premature and malicious filing of the petition for
 foreclosure of mortgage over private respondentâs property; hence, the 
prayer for damages and attorneyâs fees.

In its motion to dismiss, petitionerâs allegation that private 
respondent had no basis to claim for damages amounted to failure to 
state a cause of action. Since the allegations in the complaint furnish 
sufficient basis by which the complaint can be maintained, the same 
should not have been dismissed regardless of the defense that may be 
raised by petitioner as defendant before the trial court.
[7]


In the instant case, aside from the principal action for damages,
 private respondent sought the issuance of a temporary restraining order
 and writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the foreclosure sale in 
order to prevent an alleged irreparable injury to private respondent. It
 is settled that these injunctive reliefs are preservative remedies for 
the protection of substantive rights and interests. Injunction is not a 
cause of action in itself but merely a provisional remedy, an adjunct to
 a main suit. When the act sought to be enjoined had become 
fait accompli
,
 only the prayer for provisional remedy should be denied. However, the 
trial court should still proceed with the determination of the principal
 action so that an adjudication of the rights of the parties can be had.

It was grave error for the trial court to dismiss the case simply
 because the basis for the issuance of the writ of injunction is no 
longer existent and thus moot and academic. A case becomes moot and 
academic when there is no more actual controversy between the parties
[8]
 or no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits.
[9]

 The foregoing circumstances do not obtain in the instant case. The 
holding of the extrajudicial sale did not in any way render the case 
moot and academic. As found by the Court of Appeals, there still 
remained for the resolution of the trial court the issue of whether 
private respondent is entitled to damages prayed for as a result of 
petitionerâs act in filing a petition to foreclose the mortgage. Whether
 the filing of the petition for foreclosure was proper and whether 
private respondent suffered damages resulting from petitionerâs acts are
 still unanswered questions which have to be determined and passed upon 
by the trial court after hearing the evidence of both parties in 
accordance with due process. 

It is a rule of universal application that courts of justice are 
constituted to adjudicate substantive rights. While courts should 
consider public policy and necessity in putting an end to litigations 
speedily they must nevertheless harmonize such necessity with the 
fundamental right of litigants to an opportunity to be heard.
[10]


WHEREFORE
, the Petition is DENIED. The decision 
of the Court of Appeals dated 28 June 1995 is AFFIRMED. The records of 
this case are remanded to the trial court with a directive to proceed 
and dispose of this case expeditiously.
