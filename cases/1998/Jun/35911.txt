PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. REY SOLIS, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 
D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


In a decision, promulgated on 21 December 1995, the Regional Trial 
Court of Dagupan City, Branch 43, presided over by Judge Silverio Q. 
Castillo, found accused Rey Solis guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the 
crime of murder. Since the sentence pronounced on him was the capital 
penalty of death, the case was elevated to this Court for automatic 
review.      
  
The accused was earlier charged by the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor with murder in an information that read: 




âThat on or about October 12, 1994 at public Market, at 
Poblacion, municipality of Mangaldan, province of Pangasinan, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused, armed with a knife with intent to kill and 
treachery, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
embrace and stab EDUARDO ULIGAN y CAOILE inflicting upon him mortal 
wound which caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.


âCONTRARY to Art. 248, Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659.


âDagupan City, November 22, 1994.â
[1]
 




With the assistance of Attorney Aurora E. Valle of the Public 
Attorneyâs Office (âPAOâ), the accused entered a plea of not guilty when
 arraigned. The pre-trial conference was waived; forthwith, trial on the
 case ensued.            


The prosecution submitted its case with a presentation of an 
eyewitness account of the incident, the medical findings on the victim 
by the attending physician, the autopsy report of the examining doctor 
and the findings of police officers who conducted an investigation of 
the crime and later apprehended the accused.            


Flora Cera, an eyewitness, testified that on 12 October 1994 at 
around six oâclock in the afternoon, just after alighting from a 
tricycle at the Public Market of Mangaldan, Pangasinan, she saw Eduardo 
Uligan buying something from an ambulant vendor. Moments later, she 
beheld, from a distance of only around one and a half meters, 
accused-appellant Rey Solis come from behind Eduardo Uligan, then make a
 strangle hold on the latter and with his free right hand stabbed the 
victim with a â29â balisong (also commonly known as a âBatangas knifeâ).
[2]

 Accused-appellant hurriedly left the scene and lost himself inside the 
public market. The victim was still able to walk some distance away 
until somebody came to his succor.            


The victim was rushed to Dagupan City and brought to the emergency 
room of Medical City Dagupan, Inc., where he was promptly attended to by
 Dr. Eugenio De Leon. It was too late, however, for Eduardo Uligan. He 
expired soon after arriving at the hospital and before any medical 
treatment could be administered to him. Dr. De Leon testified that the 
wound sustained by the victim was fatal and could have been caused by a 
sharp and pointed instrument like a Batangas knife.
[3]
 


Dra. Ophelia T. Rivera conducted an autopsy on the cadaver. She 
found the victim to have sustained a single lacerated wound at the left 
chest that fractured ribs, penetrated the lungs and caused a partial 
perforation of the heart.
[4]
 
The wound must have been caused by either a sharp single or 
double-bladed weapon. The injury sustained was fatal and death was 
inevitable. Dra. Rivera concurred with Dr. De Leon in concluding that it
 was possible for the assailant to have been in front or on the left 
side of, or behind, the victim when the fatal blow was delivered.       
     


SPO4 Antonio Zabala testified that after receiving the report on 
the stabbing incident, he promptly proceeded to the Medical City 
Dagupan, Inc., to conduct an investigation. He attempted to interview 
the victim but he was unable to get any response from the dying man. He 
took, instead, the sworn statements of Flora Cera, Warlito Junio, Jr., 
and Delia Uligan.            


SPO4 Salvador Samson, an intelligence officer of the Mangaldan 
Police, declared that on 22 October 1994 he was on duty at the police 
station when he received a report that accused-appellant was in Gapan, 
Nueva Ecija. SPO4 Samson, together with a fellow officer, Mario 
Espiritu, proceeded to Gapan, Nueva Ecija, where accused-appellant was 
apprehended and brought to the Mangaldan Police Station. The police 
officers were later able to recover the weapon used in the stabbing 
incident buried under one of the stalls in the public market of 
Mangaldan.            


The victimâs widow, Delia Uligan, testified that the family spent P68,000.00 by way of actual expenses
[5]
 occasioned by the death of the victim.            


The defense presented its lone witness, accused-appellant Rey 
Solis, to negate the charge of murder against him. He admitted having 
killed the victim but he interposed the justifying circumstance of 
self-defense.            


In his testimony, accused-appellant, a vegetable vendor, denied 
having personally known the victim. According to him, at about six 
oâclock in the afternoon of 12 October 1994, he was at the Mangaldan 
Public Market when he âaccidentally bumpedâ the victim causing the 
latter to fall on the pavement. Still showing strong resentment despite 
accused-appellantâs apology, the victim slapped accused-appellant on the
 face and then pulled out a knife. The two grappled for possession of 
the knife until accused-appellant was able to wrest it away from the 
victim and, holding the latter by the neck, stabbed him on the chest. 
After the incident, he left the crime scene and proceeded to Rosario, La
 Union, by tricycle. Two days later, he went to the house of one 
Leopoldo Visperas in Sta. Maria, San Jacinto, Pangasinan, to seek the 
latterâs assistance on his intention to surrender to the authorities. He
 was brought to a certain Col. Lomibao in San Fernando, La Union.       
     


The trial court found for the prosecution; it concluded: 




âWHEREFORE, the COURT finds accused Rey Solis guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the felony of MURDER qualified by treachery defined 
and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by 
Republic Act No. 7659 and pursuant to law, the Court sentences him the 
capital penalty of DEATH and to pay Delia Q. Uligan the following to 
wit:


â1.      P68,000.00 as actual damages;

â2.      P50,000.00 as indemnity;

â3.      P50,000.00 as moral damages;

â4.      And costs.


âThe fan knife `balisongâ (Exh. I) of the accused is ordered confiscated and forfeited in favor of the government.


âSO ORDERED.â
[6]
 




In his appeal to this Court, accused-appellant sought to ascribe to the trial court the following âerrors;â 
viz
:




â1.      The Court a quo gravely erred in finding the 
accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder qualified by 
treachery (Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. No. 
7659).


â2.      The Court a quo gravely erred in sentencing the 
accused-appellant to death and in not taking into consideration the 
mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.â
[7]
 




Accused-appellant, invoking self-defense, has admitted 
responsibility for the killing of the victim. In cases, such as here, 
where an accused owns up the killing of the victim, the burden of 
evidence is shifted to him to prove by clear and convincing evidence 
that he is entitled to an extenuating circumstance and that he has 
incurred no liability therefor.
[8]
 This time, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the case submitted by the prosecution.
[9]
 


The justifying circumstance of self-defense may exempt an accused 
from criminal liability when the following requisites are met, viz: That
 (1) there has been an unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; 
(2) the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression are 
reasonably necessary; and (3) the person defending himself has not 
provoked the victim into committing the act of aggression.
[10]

 Unlawful aggression by the victim presupposes an actual, sudden and 
unexpected attack, or an imminent danger thereof, not merely a 
threatening or intimidating attitude, and there must exist a real danger
 to the life or personal safety of the person claiming self-defense.
[11]

 Along with it, there must be a reasonable necessity both in the action 
taken, as well as in the means used, to ward off the attack.            
                    


The Court has carefully examined the records and, unfortunately for
 accused-appellant, his plea of self-defense must fail.                 
               


The debilitating factor, more than anything else, against the 
self-defense theory was the testimony of Flora Cera, a 38-year old 
housewife, who positively identified accused-appellant and narrated in 
detail the incident she had witnessed. Flora Cera testified: 




âPROS. MARATA:

âQ    How about you when you saw Eduardo Uligan asking help from persons nearby, what did you do if you did any?


âA    I already run away but I am watching, sir.

âA    It is not yet too dark, sir.


âQ    What do you mean when it was not yet too dark?


âA    There is still daylight at that time, sir.â
[12]
 




Where there is no evidence to indicate that the witness against the
 accused has been actuated by any improper motive, and absent any 
compelling reason to conclude otherwise, the testimony given is 
ordinarily accorded full faith and credit
[13]
 for it is inconceivable for such a witness to openly concoct a story that would sent an innocent man to jail
[14]

 or, let alone, to the gallows. From all that can be gathered, Flora 
Cera is a disinterested eyewitness to the stabbing incident against whom
 no malice or sinister motive has been imputed.                         
                                                                        
                                                               


Surprisingly, accused-appellant himself testified that he already 
had overpowered the victim by the time the fatal thrust was delivered. 
Also noteworthy was that accused-appellant went into hiding in La Union 
immediately after the incident. The flight of an accused, when 
unexplained, would be a circumstance from which an inference of guilt 
might be drawn.
[15]
 It would 
appear that appellant did not bother to tell his version of the 
incident, but remained silent, even when brought to the Mangaldan Police
 Station. A truly innocent person would normally grasp the first 
available opportunity to defend himself and to assert his innocence over
 a crime imputed against him.                                           
                                                                        
                                             


Again, the Court might stress the rule that when the real issue is a
 clash of credibility in the testimony of witnesses, an appellate court 
would ordinarily defer to, even rely on, the assessment and judgment 
made by the trial court which concededly has better vantage points than 
the former in the determination of that issue.                          
                                                                        
                                                              


The Court, nevertheless, finds the crime committed by appellant to 
be one of homicide rather than of murder. In order to qualify a killing 
to murder, the circumstance invoked therefor by the prosecution must be 
proven as indubitably as the killing itself and cannot be deduced from 
mere inference.
[16]
 Here, the 
Court believes that the trial court has erred in appreciating treachery 
to have qualified the killing to murder. During cross-examination, 
witness Flora Cera has declared that she did not see anything prior to 
the stabbing incident; thus: 




âATTY. VALLE:


âQ    Madam Witness, when you alighted from that tricycle was your attention directed to Eduardo Uligan at once?


âA    Right after I alighted from the tricycle I saw at once Rey Solis stabbed the victim, sir.


âQ    You only saw that incident, that stabbing incident and nothing more?


âA    No more, sir.


âQ    You do not know what happened prior to that stabbing incident but it was only the stabbing?


âA    I did not see any prior incident, sir.


âQ    Madam Witness, right after you saw Rey Solis stabbed Eduardo Uligan you said you just went away, did I get you right?


âA    Yes, sir.


âCOURT:


âQ    Why did you run?


âA    Yes because I was frightened of what I witnessed, sir.â
[17]
 




The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an 
assailant without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim. 
Absent any particulars on the manner in which the aggression has 
commenced or how the story resulting in the death of the victim has 
unfolded, treachery cannot be reasonably appreciated to qualify the 
killing to murder.
[18]
 


Neither can abuse of superior strength against accused-appellant be
 used to qualify the crime to murder, the same not having been so 
alleged in the information,
[19]

 nor appreciable even as a generic aggravating circumstance for, whether
 as a qualifying circumstance or as an aggravating circumstance, abuse 
of superior strength requires, at base, a deliberate intent on the part 
of the malefactor to take advantage thereof. While abuse of superior 
strength may be considered when there is an inequality of comparative 
force between the victim and the aggressor, there must, nonetheless, be a
 situation of strength notoriously selected and made use of by the 
latter in the commission of the crime.
[20]
 


Appellantâs claim of voluntary surrender was not sufficiently 
substantiated. The evidence would indicate, in fact, that appellant was 
arrested by virtue of a warrant of arrest issued against him. On this 
score, SPO4 Antonio Zabala and SPO4 Salvador Samson testified:

âQ    How was he arrested, was he arrested by virtue of the 
warrant of arrest issued by the Municipal Trial Court of Mangaldan, 
Pangasinan?


âA    He has a standing warrant of arrest, he was arrested in Gapan, Nueva Ecija, sir.


âQ    So, he was arrested by virtue of the warrant of arrest

âATTY. VALLE:


âQ    Was he arrested in Gapan or was he surrendered by a certain barangay captain Ocampo?


âPROS. MARATA:

âWITNESS: 


He was arrested in Gapan Nueva Ecija and the arresting Brgy. Captain surrendered him to our office, sir.â
[21]
 




Testimony of SPO4 Salvador Samson
: 




âQ    Were you able to arrive at Gapan Nueva Ecija on the same date?


âA    Yes, sir.


âQ    When you arrived at Gapan, Nueva Ecija what happened there?


âA    The accused was turned over to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo Ocampo, sir.


âQ    Who turned over to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo Ocampo the person of the suspect?


âA    I could not remember, sir.


âQ    In what particular place in Gapan Nueva Ecija the accused was surrendered?


âA    I could not also remember, sir.


âQ    Do you know the person who turned over the person of the accused to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo Ocampo?


âATTY. FRANCISCO: 


Already answered. 


âCOURT: 


Sustained. 


âQ    You are mentioning of Gapan Nueva Ecija, why is it that you
 cannot mention the place where the accused was turned over to Brgy. 
Captain Wilfredo Ocampo?


âA    Because when we went there, they immediately turned over the person of the accused, sir.


âQ    Who is that person, is he a civilian or a military?


âA    Civilian, sir.


âQ    Do you know the Poblacion of Gapan, Nueva Ecija?


âA    I am aware of the Poblacion of Gapan Nueva Ecija but I am not aware of that particular barangay, sir.


âQ    That place where the person of accused was turned over by a
 certain civilian to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo Ocampo, how far is that 
barangay to Poblacion?


âA    Quite far to the Poblacion, sir.


âCOURT: 


Proceed. 


âPROS. MARATA:


âQ    Being the police officer who went with Brgy. Captain 
Wilfredo Ocampo in Gapan Nueva Ecija did you ask the person who turned 
over the accused to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo Ocampo under what authority 
he was in custody of the accused?


âA    I and my companion Mario Espiritu only went there and it was only Mr. Wilfredo Ocampo who talked with him, sir.


âCOURT:


âQ    The truth of the matter is that the accused did not 
surrender to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo Ocampo, to you as well as your 
companion but he was turned over by a civilian to Brgy. Captain Wilfredo
 Ocampo?


âA    Yes, sir.â
[22]
 




Given the above testimony, the least accused-appellant could have 
done was to present Brgy. Captain Ocampo to attest to the fact of 
surrender, if truly he did. The failure to present a witness in a 
position to establish a partyâs thesis could give rise to the 
implication that his testimony, if produced, would be adverse.          
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                  


Relative to the claim for damages by the victimâs widow, only the 
following expenses duly substantiated can be awarded by way of actual 
damages:








1. tomb -


P 2,500.00






2. funeral mass -


     600.00






3. materials and labor of tomb -


   
3,300.00






 


P 6,400.00








In order to justify a grant of actual damages, it is necessary to 
prove with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent 
proof and on good evidence obtainable by the injured party, the actual 
amount of loss.
[23]
 The award 
by the trial court of moral damages is appropriate pursuant to Article 
2219, in relation to Article 2206, of the Civil Code.  


Now to the penalty. Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, 
prescribes the penalty of reclusion temporal for homicide. There being 
no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance that can aptly be 
appreciated, the penalty shall be imposed in its medium period, the 
range of which is from fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1)
 day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months. Applying the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the range of the penalty that can be imposed
 could be anywhere within the range of prision mayor, the next lower 
degree than reclusion temporal, of from six (6) years and one (1) day to
 twelve (12) years, as minimum, to reclusion temporal in its medium 
period of from fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to 
seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, as maximum.    


WHEREFORE
, the judgment of the trial court 
convicting accused-appellant Rey Solis for the killing of Eduardo Uligan
 is MODIFIED. Accused-appellant Rey Solis is hereby found guilty of 
homicide, instead of murder, under Article 249 of the Revised Penal 
Code, and he is, accordingly, sentenced to an indeterminate imprisonment
 term of from Nine (9) years and Four (4) months of prision mayor as 
minimum to Sixteen (16) years, Five (5) months and Nine (9) days of 
reclusion temporal as maximum. He shall, pursuant to current 
jurisprudence, pay the heirs of the victim the amounts of Fifty Thousand
 Pesos (P50,000.00) by way of indemnity for the killing, Six Thousand 
Four Hundred Pesos (P6,400.00) as actual damages and Fifty Thousand 
Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages. The forfeiture ordered by the trial
 court of the fan knife used in the killing is sustained. Cost against 
appellant.
