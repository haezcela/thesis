ALMA COSEP, MARILOU COQUIA, DULCEVITA SORIANO AND MARY JANE RABORAR, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND PREMIERE DEVELOPMENT BANK, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:




The antecedents of this labor case are sufficiently and 
faithfully summarized in the Comment of the Office of the Solicitor 
General, quoted as follows:
[1]


âPetitioners Alma Cosep, Dulcevita Soriano, Marilou Coquia and Mary
 Jane Raborar were regular employees of private respondent Premiere 
Development Bank at its Guadalupe Branch, then headed by area manager 
Gloria Doplito. Cosep began working with private respondent on October 
11, 1989, Coquia, on March 7, 1994, Soriano, on April of 1992, and 
Raborar, on March 4, 1994. 


On November 17, 1994, private respondent suspended Doplito for 
alleged malversation of money belonging to its clients. Commiserating 
with Doplito, petitioners wrote an open letter which criticized private 
respondent's handling of the case of Doplito. The open letter, which was
 disseminated to the employees of private respondentâs various branches,
 stated: 




âThe transfer of assignment of Mrs. Gloria Doplito and 
subsequently her suspension have tremendously affected us, the officers 
and staff of Guadalupe and the branch as a whole. Guadalupe will not be 
the same without Ate Oyah around because whatever success it has 
attained, no one can take credit for it but only one person â with a 
heart as big as she is â the person weâve mentioned above. We felt that 
the Managementâs decision was very inconsiderate, unfair, biased, even 
inhuman. For the past 26 years, her loyalty to the bank was 
unquestionable, her integrity has been intact for those long years and 
worth mentioning here is her love to the bank which we think no 
officers(sic) or staff can surpass. Whatever she did that management 
compelled(sic) to suspend her â that â we cannot question. We cannot 
just say Forgive and Forget. What weâre saying is to give her another 
chance because we felt the accusations hurled against her were all 
peanutsâ compared to Girlie Roccoâs of Concepcion branch who admitted 
having committed the crime of stealing other peopleâs money and yet 
remained scot-free. What youâve become to tolerate this decision, you 
yourself can only answer. Its very scary working under this system 
wherein there is no justice. If they want to throw you out even if 
youâre innocent, they can. If this can happen to the officers of the 
bank how much more the security of the rank and file(sic)? Letâs put 
some decency to the bank and most importantly, to ourselves. If we 
cannot do this, weâre not worth to be called educated bank employees who
 can carry on any tasks courageously â but ROBOTS. 


Whatever may come out of this, weâre ready to face the 
consequences â for the love of Ate Oyah. Weâve grown attached to her for
 all the kindness and love she has shown us. Her many friends and 
supporters can attest to this. The clients she has unselfishly served 
and given enough accommodation(sic) to the extent of sacrificing a part 
of herself, specifically her career, will always be grateful to her. WE 
ALL ARE. 




Before we end, we want to make it clear that nobody forced us
 to do this. We did this on our own free will to show Ate Oyah how much 
we love her. Please give her a chance, thatâs what weâre only 
asking(sic). 




Thank You,

Private respondent required petitioners to explain what they meant 
by issuing the âopen letter.â It also suspended petitioner and did not 
pay their 13th month pay and wages in the meantime. 


Petitioners filed an answer, explaining that the âopen letterâ was just an exercise of their right to freedom of speech. 


On January 20, 1995, private respondent sent to each petitioner a 
memorandum dismissing them from the service effective immediately, on 
the ground that they undermined the interest of the bank. However, on 
January 23, 1995, private respondent issued to each petitioner a 
âtransfer of assignmentâ temporarily suspending the effects of the 
previous memorandum ordering their dismissal. Petitioners ignored the 
memorandum transferring them to other branches and, instead, filed a 
complaint before the Labor Arbiter against private respondent for 
illegal dismissal and unpaid wages and 13th month pay. They asked for 
separation pay and the award of moral and exemplary damages. 


Despite the filing of the complaint, private respondent again 
instructed petitioners in separate letters dated February 8, 1995 that 
they should report to their new assignments, warning that âtheir 
continued failure and/or refusals to do so shall leaveâ the bank 
âwithout any option but (to) take such action as may be warranted under 
the circumstancesâ to protect its interest. 


Petitioners subsequently wrote a letter to private respondent dated
 February 9, 1995, informing the bank that as of January 20, 1995, they 
considered themselves dismissed from the service, and that they have 
already filed a complaint with public respondent.
  


At the time of the filing of the complaint, Cosep was a cashier 
with a monthly salary of P5,440.00. Coquia, a teller, was earning 
P3,900.00 a month. Soriano, an accounting clerk, was receiving P4,500.00
 monthly. On the other hand, Raborar, a new accounts clerk, was being 
paid P3,900.00 a month.
  


On June 23, 1995, Labor Arbiter Manuel P. Asuncion issued his decision, the decretal part of which states:
  




âWHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, judgment is hereby 
rendered declaring complainants to have been illegally dismissed and 
ordering the respondent to pay the former the following: 


xxx                                    xxx                                          xxx 
[2]




SO ORDERED.â (citations omitted). 






Private respondents appealed the judgment to public respondent 
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which rendered a decision 
reversing that of the Labor Arbiter. The dispositive part of the NLRC 
decision provides:



âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is modified 
by deleting the awards of separation pay, backwages, moral and exemplary
 damages. Respondent is ordered to pay complainants their unpaid wages 
and 13th month pay as computed in the Labor Arbiterâs decision.â 
[3]






When its motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioners elevated 
the case to this Court via petition for certiorari and imputed grave 
abuse of discretion to respondent NLRC in reversing the labor arbiterâs 
finding that petitioners were illegally dismissed. The issues raised 
are:



âI 


Public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring 
that petitionersâ âtemporary suspensionâ of termination resulted in the 
lifting of their termination. 


II
  


Public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in finding 
that there were just causes for petitionersâ dismissal i.e., 
insubordination and for signing the âopen letterâ
  


III
  


Public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring 
that petitioners were validly dismissed despite private respondentâs 
assertion that they were merely being reassigned. 


IV
  


Public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in omitting 
to make a finding whether or not procedural due process requirements 
were complied with.â
[4]






The petition is impressed with merit.

In the assailed Decision, respondent NLRC declared that:



âWhile there is no dispute that the complainants were notified of 
their termination effective January 20, 1995, it also appears clear that
 the respondent lifted the effects of that termination by so informing 
them that effective January 23, 1995, they are being reassigned to 
different branches of bank. As January 20, 1995 is a Friday and January 
23, 1995 is a Monday, the two-day gap are non-working days in the bank. 
This is the basis of respondent in saying that the complainants were not
 dismissed. Respondent may have realized the severity of the earlier 
decision. 


Under such circumstances, We believe that there was no illegal dismissal of the complainants.
  


Complainants, consistent with the stand that they have been 
dismissed, remained adamant in their refusal to report for work. The 
acts of the complainants in refusing to obey the transfer order issued 
to them constitute valid and lawful basis for their termination due to 
insubordination. They should be answerable by their very acts. Even if 
they believe that the order is unreasonable, it did not give the 
complainants the prerogative not to comply.â 
[5]






According to respondent NLRC, petitioners were dismissed for 
insubordination which corresponds to willful disobedience under par. (a)
 of Article 282 of the Labor Code. We ruled in 
Gold City Integrated Port Services, Inc. vs. NLRC
[6]

 that willful disobedience of the employerâs lawful orders, as a just 
cause for dismissal of an employee, envisages the concurrence of at 
least two (2) requisites: the employeeâs assailed conduct must have been
 willful or intentional, the willfulness being characterized by a 
wrongful and perverse attitude; and the order violated must have been 
reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee and must pertain to the 
duties which he had been engaged to discharge. 

It appears from the record, however, that the earlier memorandum 
issued by private respondent dated January 20, 1995 terminated the 
services of petitioners on the ground of serious misconduct for 
violation of Rule IV of the Bankâs Code of Conduct,
[7]
 where it held as follows: 



âAs you are well aware of, Rule IV of the Bankâs Code of Conduct 
strictly prohibits an employee from undermining the interest of the Bank
 by issuing malicious, derogatory or false statements involving the good
 name of the Bank or its management/stockholders. As you are likewise 
aware of such action is considered as a serious misconduct for which the
 penalty is outright dismissal. 


By your own admission of your willful and collective authorship of 
the subject letter as well as the surreptitious distribution thereof 
with the other Guadalupe Branch personnel concerned, and based on the 
results of the investigation on such other Guadalupe Branch personnel, 
you have been determined to have committed a serious misconduct and 
willfully violated the lawful order of the Bank as embodied in Rule IV 
of the Banksâ Code of Conduct which penalizes such offense with 
dismissal. In accordance with Article 282 of the Labor Code of the 
Philippines, you are hereby dismissed from your employment immediately 
upon your receipt hereof.â
[8]






Normally, the factual findings of 
quasi-judicial
 agencies, 
such as the NLRC, which have acquired expertise in the matters entrusted
 to their jurisdiction are accorded by the Supreme Court not only 
respect but even finality if they are supported by substantial evidence,
 or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable man might accept
 as adequate to justify a conclusion.
[9]

 But this is true only when they do not come under the established 
exceptions. One of these is where the findings of the labor arbiter and 
the NLRC are contrary to each other. In the instant case, the findings 
of the NLRC and the labor arbiter are inconsistent, hence there is a 
necessity to review the records to determine which of them should be 
preferred as more conformable to the evidentiary facts. 

Contrary to the findings of the NLRC that there is a valid ground
 for dismissal, i.e. insubordination, we find that petitioners were not 
actually dismissed due to insubordination in refusing to comply with the
 notices of transfer of assignment but were dismissed for admitting 
authorship of the âopen-letter,â as evidenced by the memorandum issued 
to petitioners last January 20, 1995. Thus, for want of substantial 
basis, in fact or in law, we cannot give the stamp of finality and 
conclusiveness normally accorded to the factual findings of an 
administrative agency, such as herein public respondent NLRC,
[10]

 as even decisions of administrative agencies which are declared âfinalâ
 by law are not exempt from the judicial review when so warranted.
[11]


Private respondent bank maintains that petitioners violated a 
company policy. It is a recognized principle that company policies and 
regulations are, unless shown to be grossly oppressive or contrary to 
law, generally valid and binding on the parties and must be complied 
with until finally revised or amended, unilaterally or preferably 
through negotiation, by competent authority.
[12]

 Notwithstanding the company policy violated, the issue is whether or 
not the infraction committed by them warrants the penalty of dismissal. 
We believe not. 

The fundamental guarantees of security of tenure and due process 
dictate that no worker shall be dismissed except for just and authorized
 cause provided by law and after due process.
[13]

 Under Article 282 of the Labor Code, as amended, an employer may 
validly terminate the services of an employee on the following grounds: 
(a) serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the 
lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his 
work; (b) gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties; (c) 
fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by 
his employer or duly authorized representative; (d) commission of a 
crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or 
any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized 
representative; and (e) other causes analogous to the foregoing. 

In termination cases, the burden of proof rests on the employer to show that the dismissal is for just cause.
[14]

 When there is no showing of a clear, valid and legal cause for the 
termination of employment, the law considers the matter a case of 
illegal dismissal and the burden is on the employer to prove that the 
termination was for a valid or authorized cause.
[15]


In this case, private respondent has not established nor 
presented sufficient basis for the dismissal of petitioners from service
 on the ground of serious misconduct. As correctly found by the Labor 
Arbiter, there is nothing wrong with the petitioners issuance of the 
open-letter. It does not lay any material claims upon the bank, nor does
 it threaten any sanction, nor invoke right to credit, nor preferential 
treatment. It merely expressed an opinion. Thus, there was here no 
prejudice, nor intent to prejudice respondent as a banking entity.
[16]


Misconduct is improper or wrong conduct. It is the transgression 
of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a 
dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent 
and not mere error in judgment. The misconduct to be serious within the 
meaning of the Act must be of such a grave and aggravated character and 
not merely trivial or unimportant. Such misconduct, however serious, 
must, nevertheless, be in connection with the employeeâs work to 
constitute just cause for his separation.
[17]
 In this case however, the misconduct has no relation to the work of petitioners; hence, not a valid ground. 

On moral and exemplary damages, we found no evidence showing that
 private respondentâs dismissal of petitioners was in bad faith. Moral 
damages are recoverable only where the dismissal was attended by bad 
faith or fraud, or constituted an act oppressive to labor, or was done 
in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy.
[18]
 A dismissal may be contrary to law but by itself, it does not establish bad faith.
[19]
 In 
Primero vs. IAC
, 
[20]
 we ruled:



âxxx if the evidence adduced by the employee before the Labor 
Arbiter should establish that the employer did indeed terminate the 
employeeâs services without just cause or without judgment it shall be 
for the employer to reinstate the employee and pay him his backwages, or
 exceptionally, for the employee simply to receive separation pay. These
 are reliefs explicitly prescribed by the Labor Code. But any award of 
moral damages by the Labor Arbiter obviously cannot be based on the 
Labor Code but should be grounded on the Civil Code. Such an award 
cannot be justified solely upon the premise (otherwise sufficient for 
redress under the Labor Code) that the employer fired his employee 
without just cause or due process. Additional facts must be pleaded 
under the Civil Code, these being, to repeat, that the act of dismissal 
was attended by bad faith or fraud, or was oppressive to labor, or done 
in a manner contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy; and, of 
course, that social humiliation, wounded feelings, grave anxiety, etc., 
resulted therefrom. 




IN VIEW WHEREOF
, the assailed Decision of the NLRC 
is SET ASIDE and the decision of the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED subject
 to the MODIFICATION that the award of MORAL and EXEMPLARY DAMAGES is 
DELETED.

SO ORDERED.
