RE: REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 117, PASAY CITY.
R E S O L U T I O N




DAVIDE, JR., J.:


As a result of the judicial audit and physical inventory of 
pending cases in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 117, Pasay City, 
conducted on 18 and 19 March 1996, it was discovered that, among other 
things, although Mr. William Villaruz was the regular Deputy Sheriff of 
Branch 117, most of the writs of replevin issued in eighty-seven (87) 
civil cases were assigned to Deputy Sheriff Virgilio Villar of Branch 
111 and Deputy Sheriff Edilberto Santiago of Branch 113 said court. Upon
 inquiry, Teresita S. Pablo, Clerk of Court, Branch 117 informed the 
audit team that Deputy Sheriff Villaruz did not accept the numerous 
writs of replevin due to time constraints; and Villaruz himself 
explained that he had to request service by the other deputy sheriffs 
because many of those writs could only be served in the evening.

Conformably with the recommendation of the Office of the Court 
Administrator (OCA) in its memorandum of 24 April 1996, the court, in 
its resolution of 9 July 1996, required Deputy Sheriff Villaruz âto 
explain â¦ why he should not be held administratively liable for refusal 
to perform his official duty of serving copies of writs of replevin 
amounting to insubordination and/or gross inefficiency.â

In his Explanation of 14 August 1996, Villaruz averred that it 
was not true that he refused to serve copies of the writ of replevin, in
 fact, he spent several days and nights monitoring the whereabouts of 
the properties to be seized; that although there were times when due to 
asthma attacks, he had to pass on service of the writs to his 
co-sheriffs in order not to impair the administration of justice, he 
nevertheless continued to perform his official duties of serving 
subpoenae and other court processes; and that due to his deteriorating 
health and age, he would like to avail of early retirement so as not to 
prejudice the best interest of the service.

In its resolution of 12 November 1996, the Court required 
Villaruz to submit copies of the sheriffâs returns of service which he 
filed with Branch 117 from January 1995 up to the present, and to inform
 the Court if he would submit his case for resolution on the basis of 
his 14 August 1996 explanation.

In his letter of 2 January 1997, Villaruz complied with the 12 
November 1996 resolution and manifested that he was submitting his case 
for resolution on the basis of his explanation.

On 17 June 1997, the Court referred the case to the OCA for 
re-evaluation, report and recommendation. The OCA then recommended that 
Villaruz be required to submit a âproperly notarized Medical Certificate
 attesting to his asthmatic conditionâ¦which prevented him from 
performing his duties,â which the Court approved in our resolution of 23
 September 1997.

On 24 November 1997, Villaruz submitted medical certificates 
dated as follows: (1) 13 May 1996 and 19 November 1997 issued by Dr. 
Delfin P. Santos stating that Villaruz was under his care for recurring 
bronchial asthma since 1988; (2) 23 September 1997, issued by the Holy 
Saviouâs Family Clinic stating that Villaruz was examined on 26 August 
and 23 September 1997, for difficulty of breathing and was diagnosed as 
suffering from bronchial asthma; (3) 20 August 1996, showing that 
Villaruz was treated at Estuita Clinic of Internal Medicine for 
moderately severe asthmatic bronchitis; and (4) 27 August 1996, issued 
by Dr. Winchito M. Moral stating that Villaruz was treated for asthmatic
 bronchitis.

In its Memorandum of 18 February 1998, the OCA informed the Court
 that Deputy Sheriff Villaruz had applied for optional retirement 
effective 15 July 1997, which request was still pending due to this 
case, and that an inquiry from the Leave Section of the Office of the 
Administrative Services revealed that for the period of 1 January 1995 
to 14 July 1997, he had no application for leave of absence except for 
the period of 7-30 April 1997 for vacation leave, and that he did not 
file his daily time records from 16 May to 14 July 1997. The OCA then 
observed and found:



At the very outset, Deputy Sheriff Villaruz claimed that the other 
deputy sheriff[s] performed his duties for him because the defendants 
could only be served the writs in the late evening. This assertion 
corroborates Branch Clerk of Court Pablo's disclosure of time 
constraints as the reason for his refusal sometimes to enforce writs of 
replevin.
  


Later, he altered his excuse averring instead asthmatic condition. 
Explored, this ground opens the question of his work performance, office
 attendance and application for early retirement.
  


The Sheriffâs Returns of Service on record show that in 1995, he 
discharged his duties only in the months of May-August and 
November-December; in 1996, in the months of February and September 
âDecember; and in 1997, only in the month of February. There is no 
showing that he performed his duties the rest of the time. Viewing that 
no leaves of absences were filed and no reported unauthorized absences 
were incurred on the dates he did not perform his duties, we presume 
that he regularly reported to work without rendering actual service. 


The medical certificates bear no moment in the light of 
respondentâs consistent attendance. In any case, there is nothing in the
 medical certificates that suggests that his asthmatic condition 
incapacitated him from discharging his duties. Moreover, if his health 
was undermining the quality of his work and conversely, his work further
 impaired his health, he should have filed an application for disability
 retirement and not early retirement. Finally, as observed in this 
Officeâs Memorandum of August 18, 1997, âthe absence of any any [sic] 
communication casts some doubts as to the real reason for his request 
for succor from other sheriffs, so that the writs under his care can be 
implemented.â
  


We are not persuaded by the documents on record that health reasons
 brought about his failure to perform his duties, hence, our conclusion 
that he is administratively liable for negligence and insubordination.
  




The Office of the Court Administrator thus recommend that:



Deputy Sheriff Villaruz be FINED in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND 
(P5,000.00) PESOS to be remitted to the Court within THIRTY (30) DAYS 
from notice.
  




The Court agrees with the OCA only insofar as the recommended penalty
 is concerned, but cannot subscribe to the view that Villaruz is liable 
for ânegligence and insubordination.â Plainly, ânegligenceâ is not 
involved here. What the OCA may have had in mind was âneglect of duty,â 
one of the grounds for disciplinary action under Sec. 46(3), Chapter 7, 
Subtitle A, Title I, Book V, Administrative Code of 1987.

Negligence
 is not synonymous with âneglect of duty.â The
 former pertains to the failure to observe such care as a reasonably 
prudent and careful person would use under similar circumstances; it is 
the doing of some act which a person of ordinary prudence would not have
 done under similar circumstances. It is a conduct which falls below the
 standard established by law for the protection of others against 
unreasonable risk of harm; a departure from the conduct expected of a 
reasonably prudent person under like circumstances (BLACKâS LAW 
DICTIONARY 930-931, 5th ed., hereafter BLACKâS). At bottom, it is a test
 of foreseeability, and in this jurisdiction, may be deemed either a 
quasi
-delict
 under Chapter 2, Title XVII, Book IV, Civil Code, or a delict under 
Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, depending on the facts attending 
its commission. Likewise, it may be ground for administrative liability 
of a government official or employee.

The Court likewise does not perceive âinsubordinationâ as 
pertinent to this proceeding. While it is another ground for 
disciplinary action against erring civil servants (Sec. 46[25], Chapter 
7, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V, Administrative Code of 1987), it 
properly refers to wilful or intentional disregard to some lawful and 
reasonable instructions of the employer (BLACKâS 720). Here, there is no
 showing that any of Villuruzâ immediate superiors instructed him to 
serve the writs of replevin and that he wilfully or intentionally 
refused to do so. What appears clear from the record is that he 
requested that the writs be served by other deputy sheriffs due to his 
alleged asthmatic condition and that his requests were accommodated. In 
fact, the Clerk of Court of Branch 117 even tolerated this practice as 
neither has it been shown that he ever called Villaruzâ attention to 
this irregularity.

To our mind, what Villaruz must be sanctioned for is either 
neglect of duty
 or 
conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service
, pursuant to Sec. 46(3) and (27), respectively, Chapter 7, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V, Administrative Code of 1987.

This Court has time and again stressed that each and every 
employee in the judiciary is a vital link in the chain which binds all 
those involved in the sacred task of administering justice. And as the 
chain can only be as strong as its weakest link, by the very nature of 
the duties and responsibilities of those so involved, be they the 
seemingly lowliest clerk or the Executive Judge, they must all 
faithfully adhere to, hold inviolate and invigorate the principle 
solemnly enshrined in Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution, that 
public office is a public trust and, as such, all public officers and 
employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them 
with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency and act 
with patriotism and justice and lead modest lives. Thus, will this Court
 never tolerate or condone any conduct, act or omission on the part of 
officers and employees of the judiciary which would violate the norm of 
public accountability or diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith 
of the people in the justice system (Sy v. Academia, 198 SCRA 705 
[1991]; Annang v. Vda. De Blas, 202 SCRA 635 [1991]).

The alleged asthmatic condition of Deputy Sheriff Villaruz 
provided him no excuse to be remiss in the performance of his duties, 
nor did it exempt him from the exacting demands of the public trust 
character of his office. In the first place, what is telling for 
Villaruz is that while his ailment had been characterized as ârecurrentâ
 or âmoderately severe,â there is at all no showing that his condition 
had degenerated to such a stage that would have reduced him to the 
demonstrated levels of neglect of duty and inefficiency. The medical 
certificates he submitted failed to so indicate the gravity of his 
disorder which could have accounted for, but certainly not have 
justified, his ineptitude, as most of the dates of treatment mentioned 
therein were post-audit dates. Moreover, considering that he submitted 
these medical certificates only after he was required to do so, and not 
of his own volition, to support his allegations in his explanation, 
there is much doubt as to the credibility of the entries therein. 
Confirming this doubt is the finding of the OCA that for the periods 
material to this case, Villaruz did not apply for sick leave and nothing
 in his daily time records suggested that he was absent due to sickness.
 If indeed he had frequent bouts of asthma, then he must have absented 
himself from work, or if he did not, necessarily he must have simply 
rested in the office, much like a non-performing asset, to the prejudice
 of public service.

WHEREFORE
, for neglect of duty and for conduct 
prejudicial to the best interest of the service, Deputy Sheriff WILLIAM 
VILLARUZ is hereby FINED in the amount of FIVE THOUSAND (P5,000.00) 
PESOS payable to this Court within ten (10) days from notice of this 
resolution. He is further WARNED that the commission of the same or 
similar acts or omissions in the future shall be dealt with more 
severely.

SO ORDERED.



Narvasa, C.J., Regalado, Romero, Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Martinez, Quisumbing
, and 
Purisima, JJ.
, concur.
