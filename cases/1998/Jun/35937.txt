MARTINEZ, J.:


This case illustrates the application of the legal precept that 
the law aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights. 
Vigilantibus, sed non dormientibus jura subverniunt
.

The facts:

On September 14, 1955, Edilberta Pandinco filed a petition
[1]

 for the settlement of the testate estate of Vicenta Alviar, before then
 Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of BiÃ±an, Laguna, 
which was docketed as Special Proceeding No. 4749. The subject thereof 
for probate is the will
[2]
 of Vicenta Alviar, portions of which read:



"xxx xxx xxx 


'Aking sinasaysay at ipinaliliwanag na ako'y tatlo (3) ang naging 
anak sa nasirang asawa, MONICO PANDINCO, na ang mga pangalan ay itong 
sumusunod:
  




ELVIRA Pandinco, buhay pa;
        

        LEONOR Pandinco, buhay pa; at
        

        GADIOSA Pandinco, patay na.
    




Ang anak kong GADIOSA PANDINCO ay nagkaroon ng labing dalawang (12) anak na ang mga pangalan ay:
  




Edilberta Pandinco,
        

        Catalina Salandanan,
        

        Alfredo Salandanan,

        Vedasto Salandanan.
    




Ako'y may apo sa tuhod na ang pangalan ay Ambrocio Salandanan, anak ni Belen Salandanan.
  


xxx xxx xxx 
  


Ipinatatanto ko na sa kasalukuyan ay ako'y viuda, at ang aking mga 
taga pagmana ay wala kundi ang aking dalawang anak at mga apo na 
binabangit sa itaas."
  




The will was admitted to probate on July 8, 1957. Thereafter, a project of partition
[3]
dated
 August 13, 1960, duly signed by all the heirs and acknowledged before a
 notary public, was approved by the probate court on August 29, 1960.
[4]


On September 17, 1966, the probate court approved and declared as
 valid the transfer of the petitionersâ shares to their co-heir, 
respondent Elvira Pandinco, over the estate of Vicenta Alviar.

On August 18, 1995, petitioners filed a "Motion To Reopen The 
Case and Set Aside Partition with Preliminary Injunction" before the 
Regional Trial Court of BiÃ±an, Laguna (Branch XXV). The motion alleged 
inter alia that petitioners never signed the project of partition or 
acknowledged the same before a notary public; that they never appeared 
or testified before the probate court to affirm their agreement to the 
partition; that they never sold their shares to Elvira Pandinco; that 
while Catalina Salandanan testified in the probate of the will, she did 
not testify regarding the sale; that they never received any order from 
the court approving the project of partition and the order finding valid
 and binding the transfer and sale of their shares to respondent Elvira 
Pandinco; and that they came to know of the Order of September 17, 1966 
only in 1990 when they secured a copy thereof from the court.
[5]


The motion was opposed by private respondents who are the heirs of Elvira Pandinco.

On December 19, 1995, the lower court denied petitioners' motion on the ground of estoppel by laches ratiocinating thus:



"There is no showing that movants ever filed a Petition for Review 
on Appeal of the Court of Appeals' Resolution dated July 16,1960 
dismissing the appeal on the aforementioned first Order, or an Appeal on
 the second and third Orders, thereby making the triple Orders final and
 executory since twenty nine (29) years ago. 


'It was only in August, 1995 or more than twenty nine (29) years 
from date of the above-stated Court Orders that herein movants filed the
 subject Motion to Reopen the above-entitled case, to Set Aside the 
project of partition which was already implemented in the light of its 
finality and to NULLIFY the sales and/or transfers to Elvira Pandinco.
  


'Jurisprudence on this matter is well-settled. Where a party sleeps
 on his rights and allows laches to set in, the same is fatal to his 
case (Periquet, Jr. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 238 SCRA 697). 
Laches had been defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable 
and unexplained length of time, to do that which by exercising due 
diligence could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or 
omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a 
presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it
 or declined to assert it (Olizon vs. Court of Appeals, 236 SCRA 148)."
  




Aggrieved, petitioners went to the Court of Appeals through a 
petition for certiorari alleging that the orders of the probate court 
are all contrary to law and were issued with grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
[6]
 On December 27,1996, the respondent Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, ruling in this wise:



"The proper remedy then for herein petitioners would have been to 
file an appeal questioning the decree of distribution, within the 
reglementary period. However, the records reveal that they have not 
availed of such remedy and would only now belatedly raise a protest 
against matters which have become long ago settled, final and binding. 
Petitioners cannot be allowed to benefit from their inaction and neglect
 for an unreasonable length of time, by the simple expedient of bringing
 this special civil action for certiorari, allegedly on jurisdictional 
grounds. It has been held time and again that certiorari may not be used
 as a substitute for a lost appeal."
  




Petitioners now come to us seeking the nullification of the 
respondent Court of Appeal's decision contending that it erred or 
committed grave abuse of discretion: (1) in sustaining the probate 
court's Orders dated August 29, 1960, September 17, 1966 and December 
19, 1995; (2) in finding that the proper remedy in assailing the said 
Orders is an appeal; and (3) in finding them guilty of laches.

The petition must fail.

Petitioners cannot now assail the orders of the probate court as 
the same had already attained finality. The project of partition was 
executed on August 16, 1960. It was approved on August 29, 1960 or 
thirty-eight (38) years ago. Since no appeal was filed by the 
petitioners, the assailed orders, by operation of law, became final. The
 said orders cannot, therefore, by a mere motion, be set aside. 

As we have enunciated in 
Vda. De Kilayko vs. Tengco
:
[7]




"A final decree of distribution of the estate of a deceased person 
vests title to the land of the estate in the distributees. If the decree
 is erroneous, it should be corrected by opportune appeal, for once it 
becomes final, its binding effect is like any other judgment in rem, 
unless properly set aside for lack of jurisdiction or fraud. Where court
 has validly issued a decree of distribution and the same has become 
final, the validity or invalidity of the project partition becomes 
irrelevant."
  




Similarly, petitioners cannot seek the re-opening of the probate 
proceedings which had long been terminated. They cannot, in the same 
manner, question the order validating the transfer and/or sale of their 
shares in favor of respondent Elvira Pandinco which was issued on 
September 17, 1966, or thirty-two (32) years ago. 

It is a fundamental principle of public policy in every jural 
system that at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts should
 become final at some definite time fixed by law (
interest rei publicae ut finis sit litum
). "The very object of which the courts were constituted was to put an end to controversies."
[8]
 Once a judgment or an order of a court has become final, the issues raised therein should be laid to rest.
[9]


Moreover, petitioners' long delayed action in assailing the 
Orders of the probate court is fatal to their cause of action as laches 
has already set in. 

Laches is the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable length of 
time to do that which by exercising due diligence could or should have 
been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within
 a reasonable time warranting a presumption that the party entitled to 
assert it has either abandoned it or has declined to assert it.
[10]

 It has also been defined as such neglect or omission to assert a right 
taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other circumstances 
causing prejudice to an adverse party, as will operate as a bar in 
equity.
[11]


We have ruled in 
Catholic Bishop of Balanga vs Court of Appeals
,
[12]
 that:



"The principle of laches is a creation of equity which, as such, is
 applied not really to penalize neglect or sleeping upon one's right, 
but rather to avoid recognizing a right when to do so would result in a 
clearly inequitable situation. As an equitable defense, laches does not 
concern itself with the character of the defendant's title, but only 
with whether or not by reason of the plaintiff's long inaction or 
inexcusable neglect, he should be barred from asserting this claim at 
all, because to allow him to do so would be inequitable and unjust to 
the defendant. 




'The doctrine of laches or stale demands is based upon grounds of
 public policy which requires, for the peace of society, the 
discouragement of stale claims and x x x is principally a question of 
the inequity or unfairness of permitting a right or claim to be enforced
 or asserted.'
    




The time-honored rule anchored on public policy is that relief will
 be denied to a litigant whose claim or demand has become 'stale' or who
 has acquiesced for an unreasonable length of time, or who has not been 
vigilant or who has slept on his rights either by negligence, folly or 
inattention. In other words, public policy requires, for the peace of 
society, the discouragement of claims grown stale for non-assertion; 
thus laches is an impediment to the assertion or enforcement of a right 
which has become, under the circumstances, inequitable or unfair to 
permit."
  




Petitioners' neglect or omission to assert a supposed right for more 
than thirty (30) years is too long a time as to warrant the presumption 
that they had either abandoned such right or had conceded the 
correctness of the assailed Orders. Indeed, the law helps the vigilant 
but not those who sleep on their rights. For time is a means of 
destroying obligations and actions, because time runs against the 
slothful and contemners of their own rights.
