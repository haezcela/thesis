PERLITO D. FLORES, ARLYN H. ARABILLA, DOMINGO RAMIREZ, JORGE BANDALAN, VICENTE ASILOM, MARY JANE VILLEGAS, JOEL DIAZ AND ELVIRA VALENZONA, COMPLAINANTS, VS. JUDGE ANTONIO C. SUMALJAG, ACTING PRESIDING JUDGE, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 5, BAYBAY, LEYTE, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


This is an administrative case against Judge Antonio C. Sumaljag,
 Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 5, Municipal Trial Court of Baybay, 
Leyte, for gross ignorance of the law in connection with the preliminary
 investigation of three criminal cases and the arrest of complainants.

Respondent, whose regular station was at Branch 2 of the Municipal Trial Court of Albuera, Leyte, retired on December 13, 1996.

Complainants Perlito D. Flores, Arlyn H. Arabilla, Domingo 
Ramirez, Jorge Bandalan, Vicente Asilom, Mary Jane Villegas, Joel Diaz 
and Elvira Valenzona are members of the Sangguniang Pambarangay of 
Domingo C. Veloso in Baybay, Leyte, who were charged with three counts 
of falsification of public document as defined in Art. 171, pars. 2, 4 
and 8 of the Revised Penal Code. In Criminal Case No. R-3231-A, it was 
charged -



That on or about the 19th day of November, 1996, at Barangay 
Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, [all the herein 
complainants] in their capacities as members of Sangguniang Pambarangay 
of the said barangay (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, conspiring together and 
confiderating (sic) themselves did then and there wilfully and 
feloneously (sic) prepare a spurious and falsified excerpt from the 
alleged minutes of the purported regular session allegedly on August 24,
 1996, which never was to falsely substantiate the purported Resolution 
No. 14, Series of 1996, unduly protesting the application of complainant
 Gualberto Parmis to own Lot No. 521-A with the DENR, located in Sitio 
Hayahay, Barangay Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8), Baybay, Leyte, with DENR 
of Ormoc City, intercalating thereby that Gualberto Parmis is not a 
resident of said Barangay when he is a bona fide resident thereat and in
 fact he has his house of abode erected thereat, by letting it appear 
also in that spurious minutes alluded to as the result of a regular 
session on August 24, 1996, when in fact and in truth, no regular 
session was held on August 24, 1996, on the aspect of the said undue 
protest to the application of Gualberto Parmis to own Lot No. 521-A with
 the DENR, that none of the accused deliberated nor discussed re the 
concocted Resolution 14, alluded to, none of them signed the minutes or 
excerpt thereof because no minutes whatsoever on that aspect was 
obtaining then on August 24, 1996, and the spurious minutes or excerpt 
thereof was only crafted unduly and contrively prepared only on November
 19, 1996, to the damage and prejudice of the undersigned complainant 
Gualberto Parmis in violation of item 8, Article 171 of the Revised 
Penal Code.
  


CONTRARY TO LAW.
  




In Criminal Case No. R-3227-A, the complaint, filed by the chief of police of Baybay, Rolando C. Piamonte, charged -



That on or about the 24th day of August, 1996, at Barangay Domingo 
C. Veloso (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, [the herein complainants Perlito D.
 Flores and Arlyn H. Arabilla], in their capacities as Barangay Captain 
and Barangay Secretary, respectively, conspiring together and 
confiderating (sic) themselves did then and there wilfully, and 
feloneously (sic), prepare a purported Barangay Resolution No. 14, 
Series of 1996, unduly protesting the application of one Gualberto 
Parmis to own Lot No. 521-A, CSD 14542-D, located in Sitio Hayahay, 
Barangay Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8), Baybay, Leyte, with the DENR of 
Ormoc City, by narrating falsely having it appeared (sic) thereat that 
he is not residing in said Barangay and it was enacted on motion of 
Kagawad Rodulfo M. Roca at a regular session and attended by the 
Barangay Officials, Mr. Perlito D. Flores, Mr. Domingo C. Ramirez, Mr. 
Jose M. Bandalan, Mr. Vicente J. Asilom, Mr. Diego C. Cala, Jr., Mr. 
Rodulfo M. Roca, Mrs. Mary Jane L. Villegas, Mr. Joel A. Diaz, Miss Ma. 
Elvira F. Valenzona and Mrs. Evelyn A. Calipayan, when in truth and in 
fact, there was no such regular session obtaining on such a date 
mentioned in the questioned resolution nor such resolution was enacted 
on motion of Mr. Rodulfo M. Roca, nor such barangay officials mentioned 
thereon participated in the alleged proceeding as it never was as they 
did not in fact participate and when verily Gualberto G. Parmis is a 
bona fide resident at said Barangay with his family and has a house 
thereat where he and his family have their abode to the damage and 
prejudice of Gualberto G. Parmis.
  


CONTRARY TO LAW. 
  




In Criminal Case No. R-3228-A, the complaint, which was also filed by the chief of police, charged -



That on or about the 24th day of August, 1996, at Barangay Domingo 
C. Veloso (Zone 8) of Baybay, Leyte, [the herein complainants Perlito D.
 Flores and Arlyn H. Arabilla] in their capacities as Barangay Captain 
and Barangay Secretary, respectively, conspiring together and 
confiderating (sic) themselves did then and there wilfully, and 
feloneously (sic), prepare a purported Barangay Resolution No. 14, 
Series of 1996, unduly protesting the application of one Gualberto 
Parmis to own Lot No. 521-A, CSD 14542-D, located in Sitio Hayahay, 
Barangay Domingo C. Veloso (Zone 8), Baybay, Leyte, with the DENR of 
Ormoc City, by falsely having it appeared thereat that Gualberto Parmis 
is not residing in said Barangay and it was enacted on motion of Kagawad
 Rodulfo M. Roca at a regular session and attended by the Barangay 
Officials, Mr. Perlito D. Flores, Mr. Domingo C. Ramirez, Mr. Jorge M. 
Bandalan, Mr. Vicente J. Asilom, Mr. Diego C. Cala, Jr., Mr. Rodulfo M. 
Roca, Mrs. Mary Jane L. Villegas, Mr. Joel A. Diaz, Miss Ma. Elvira F. 
Valenzona and Mrs. Evelyn A. Calipayan, when in truth and in fact, there
 was no such regular session obtaining on such a date mentioned in the 
questioned resolution nor such resolution was enacted on motion of 
Kagawad Rodulfo M. Roca, nor such barangay officials mentioned therein 
participated in the alleged proceeding as it never was as they did not 
in fact participate.
  


CONTRARY TO LAW.
  




On November 25, 1996, respondent judge conducted a preliminary 
examination, during which the complainant, Gualberto Parmis, and his 
witness, Diego Cala, Jr., testified in each of the criminal cases. 
Thereafter, respondent judge ordered the arrest of herein complainants. 
By virtue of warrants of arrest, the herein complainants were arrested 
and detained. They were later released on bail.

The complainants instituted this administrative case against 
respondent judge. As Deputy Court Administrator Bernardo Abesamis 
summarizes in his memorandum, complainantsâ allegations relate to four 
main points:
[1]




 the testimonies during the preliminary examinations failed to establish probable cause;
  
 in Criminal Case Nos. R-3227-A and R-3228-A, the complainant was 
not personally examined by respondent, the ones who testified being only
 complainantâs witnesses; 
 in Criminal Case No. R 3231-A, there was absence of âsearching 
questions and answersâ during the preliminary examination, the questions
 propounded being answerable by âYes, Judgeâ; 
 there was no cause under the law to arrest them as the 
possibility of fleeing to escape the hands of justice is remote as they 
are barangay officials. 




Deputy Court Administrator Abesamis thought that the first and last 
charges involve the exercise of judicial discretion in determining the 
existence of probable cause and the probability of flight and therefore 
believed that these were not proper subjects of administrative 
disciplinary action. However, he opined that the second and third 
charges involve the âproper observance of procedural rules and due 
processâ and should be looked into. For this reason, he recommended that
 respondent judge be required to comment.

Respondent was required to comment. In his comment dated May 14, 
1997, respondent maintained that he observed the pertinent legal 
procedures before issuing the warrants of arrest against complainants. 
He said that the quantum of evidence required in preliminary 
investigation had likewise been observed. He contended that, by posting 
bail, complainants waived objection to any irregularities which might 
have been committed in the course of the preliminary investigation. 
Respondent claimed that the present case is just a rehash of another 
administrative case filed against him (Administrative Case No. OCA-IPI 
97-253-MTJ) which was dismissed by this Court for lack of merit.

First
. Complainants claim that, contrary to Rule 112, 
Â§6(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, respondent did not ask the 
complainant and the witnesses searching questions but mainly questions 
designed to make them merely affirm what they had previously stated in 
their affidavits. Deputy Court Administrator Abesamis notes that the 
questions asked by the respondent were leading and ârevealed the 
latterâs apparent knowledge of the case which the witness testifying had
 only to confirm with a âYes, Judge.ââ
[2]


The transcript of the preliminary investigation shows that some 
of the questions asked by the respondent were indeed leading. It is 
evident, however, that he was dealing with witnesses who were reticent 
and had to be prodded if their examination was to be searching. Most of 
the time, complainant Gualberto Parmis and his witness Diego Cala, Jr. 
merely said âYes, Judgeâ in answer to questions put to them. The only 
way to make them explain was to ask them leading questions.

Deputy Court Administrator Abesamis contends that the respondent 
revealed his apparent knowledge of the facts of the case which the 
witness testifying before him only needed to confirm with a âYes, 
Judge.â Obviously, this is because the judge based his questions on the 
allegations of the complaint and the affidavits of the complainant and 
the witnesses. In fact, the first questions he asked concerned the 
execution of affidavits. If the only way to make the witnesses give 
details was to ask questions based on their complaints and affidavits, 
we see no reason why this should be considered improper. After all, the 
witnesses could deny what the judge asked them if it was not true. 

The following excerpt from the transcript of the preliminary 
examination of complainant and his witness belies the allegations of 
complainants that respondent did not ask searching or probing questions 
but, through leading questions, simply fished for evidence in 
determining probable cause. 



COURT:
  


Q-    Your dialogue was made on the 15th day of November, 1996?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    But the resolution was passed in the regular session on August 24, 1996?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    And when she answered you she has not yet prepared the minutes and she has not yet prepared the logbook?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    So, in other words, said Secretary of the Barangay, Arlyn 
Arabilla, has no knowledge whether there was Regular Session on August 
24, 1996, because she was only made to sign that prepared resolution by 
the Barangay Captain?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    At that time on November 15, 1996 when you had a dialogue 
with Arlyn Arabilla, was she able to present to you anything that would 
support their claim that there was a Regular Session held on August 24, 
1996?
      

      A-    None.
  


Q-    Now, since you had a copy of that resolution, did you show this Resolution No. 14 to Arlyn Arabilla?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    And then, what did she say?
      

      A-    She told me that this resolution was made from the excerpt of the minutes.
  


Q-    And said Secretary was not able to produce the minutes of that session supposedly held on August 24, 1996?
      

      A-    Yes, Judge.
  


Q-    Were you alone when you went to the house of Arlyn Arabilla?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    So, in other words, there was no Regular Session ever held on
 August 24, 1996 as claim (sic) by the Barangay Captain which was the 
basis for Resolution No. 14?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    It was only the Barangay Captain who prepared this resolution and there has been no minutes at all up to the present time?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    In other words, the Barangay Captain clearly falsified this Resolution No. 14?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    Although it appears to be attested by the Barangay Secretary 
who claim (sic) that she was just requested and pressed by the Barangay 
Captain to sign the said resolution?
      

      A-    Yes, Judge.
  


Q-    Said resolution is not supported by any minutes?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
  


Q-    And when you find out this resolution, this was only a resolution handed to you by DENR without any supporting minutes?
      

      A-    Yes, sir.
[3]






While some of the questions of the judge clearly suggested the 
answers, nonetheless it is clear that the answers were still those of 
the witnesses and not those of the judge. We are satisfied that as far 
as the duty to ask âsearching questionsâ is concerned, respondent 
complied with his duty under the Rules of Court. 

Second
. The complainants aver that the testimonies of 
Gualberto Parmis and Diego Cala, Jr. during the preliminary examination 
failed to establish probable cause. They cited instances to prove this 
point. 

(1) Gualberto Parmis testified that the other barangay officials 
charged in the complaint were only misled into signing Resolution No. 14
 by being asked by Perlito D. Flores, the punong barangay, to sign 
several papers, which they did not suspect included the resolution in 
question. Hence, it would appear that only Perlito D. Flores was guilty 
of âintercalating any instrumentâ in a registry or official book within 
the meaning of Art. 171(8) of the Revised Penal Code. The other barangay
 officials are innocent. 

It should be noted, however, that the charge against complainants
 herein is that, as barangay officials, they prepared a spurious excerpt
 from the minutes of an alleged session of the barangay council in order
 to show that Resolution No. 14, Series of 1996 had been adopted at the 
session allegedly held on August 24, 1996 of the Sangguniang 
Pambarangay. Even if the barangay officials signed Resolution No. 14 by 
mistake, this fact would not show that they did not take part in the 
preparation of spurious minutes or excerpts thereof. 

(2) According to complainants, Diego Cala, Jr. testified that, on
 August 24, 1996, he could not have taken part in the deliberation of 
the Sangguniang Pambarangay of Domingo C. Veloso in Baybay, Leyte 
because he was then in Cebu. Therefore, he could not have known whether 
or not the council had a session on that day and whether the other 
members were not present at its session.

Complainants miss the point. Precisely, what Diego Cala, Jr. is 
saying is that he could not have attended the session of the barangay 
council on August 24, 1996 because he was then in Cebu. 

Anyway, the determination of the individual liability of the 
accused would have to await trial. For purposes of the preliminary 
investigation, which was summary in nature, it was enough that there was
 evidence showing that the crime had been committed and that the accused
 were probably guilty thereof. Any error which might have been committed
 at this stage could be corrected after the case was filed in the 
Regional Trial Court. As held in 
Angcog v. Tan
,



the determination that there was probable cause which is judgmental
 and which, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion or malice, may 
not necessarily give rise to disciplinary action . . .
[4]






To hold a judge accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision 
which he might render would be nothing short of harassment and would 
make his job unbearable.
[5]


Third
. Complainants point out that in Criminal Cases 
Nos. R-3227-A and R-3228-A, only the witnesses were examined by the 
judge. The chief of police was the complainant but he was not examined. 
Complainants cite Rule 112, Â§6(b) which provides:



(b)               
By the Municipal Trial Court
. --- If the
 municipal trial court judge conducting the preliminary investigation is
 satisfied after an examination in writing and under oath of the 
complainant and his witnesses

 in the form of searching questions and answers, that a probable cause 
exists and that there is a necessity of placing the respondent under 
immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice, he 
shall issue a warrant of arrest. (Emphasis added)
  




The contention has no merit. The complainant in these cases is not 
the chief of police. The chief of police signed the complaints in these 
cases simply as prosecutor, pursuant to Rule 110, Â§5 which in part 
provides:



Who must prosecute criminal actions
. --- . . . [I]n the 
Municipal Trial Courts or Municipal Circuit Trial Courts when there is 
no fiscal available, the offended party, 
any peace officer
 or public officer charged with the enforcement of the law violated may prosecute the case. (Emphasis added)
  




The complainant in the two cases was Gualberto Parmis, who testified, together with Diego Cala, Jr.

Fourth
. Finally, it is contended that respondent ordered
 the arrest of complainants without the justification of doing so âin 
order not to frustrate the ends of justice,â as provided in Rule 112, 
Â§6(b). 

We find this contention to be meritorious. What differentiates 
the present rule from the previous one before the 1985 revision of the 
Rules on Criminal Procedure is that while before, it was mandatory for 
the investigating judge to issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused
 if he found probable cause, the rule now is that the investigating 
judgeâs power to order the arrest of the accused is limited to instances
 in which there is a necessity for placing him in custody âin order not 
to frustrate the ends of justice.â The arrest of the accused can be 
ordered only in the event the prosecutor files the case and the judge of
 the Regional Trial Court finds probable cause for the issuance of a 
warrant of arrest. As this Court said in 
Samulde v. Salvani, Jr.
:
[6]




It is entirely new rule, and it is plain to see that it is not 
obligatory, but merely discretionary, upon the investigating judge to 
issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused, even after having 
personally examined the complainant and his witnesses in the form of 
searching questions and answers, for the determination of whether a 
probable cause exists and whether it is necessary to arrest the accused 
in order not to frustrate the ends of justice, is left to his sound 
judgment or discretion.
  




Accordingly, in 
Mantaring v. Roman
,
[7]

 we reprimanded a judge in a preliminary investigation for issuing a 
warrant without any finding that it was necessary to place the accused 
in immediate custody in order to prevent a frustration of justice. In 
this case, it appears that respondent ordered the issuance of a warrant 
of arrest solely on his finding of probable cause, totally omitting to 
consider whether it was necessary to do so in order not to frustrate the
 ends of justice.

As already stated, respondent has since retired. This fact, 
however, does not render this case moot and academic. As held in Gallo 
v. Cordero:
[8]




[T]he jurisdiction that was ours at the time of the filing of the 
administrative complaint was not lost by the mere fact that the 
respondent public official had ceased in office during the pendency of 
his case. The Court retains its jurisdiction either to pronounce the 
respondent official innocent of the charges or declare him guilty 
thereof. A contrary rule would be fraught with injustices and pregnant 
with dreadful and dangerous implications . . . . If innocent, respondent
 officials merits vindication of his name and integrity as he leaves the
 government which he has served well and faithfully; if guilty, he 
deserves to receive the corresponding censure and a penalty proper and 
imposable under the situation.
  




On the other hand, considering that respondent judge has retired, the
 only appropriate penalty that could be imposed on him, in light of what
 he failed to do in this case, is a fine of P5,000.00.
[9]


Accordingly, a FINE of P5,000.00 is hereby imposed on respondent 
Judge Antonio Sumaljag, the amount to be deducted from whatever 
retirement benefits he may be entitled to receive.

SO ORDERED.
