RE: REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONALTRIAL COURT, BRANCHES 4 AND 23, MANILA, AND METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 14, MANILA.
R E S O L U T I O N




DAVIDE, JR., J.:


In view of the compulsory retirements of the respective presiding
 judges, judicial audits on all pending cases were conducted by the 
Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) at Branches 4 and 23 of the 
Regional Trial Court of Manila and Branch 14 of the Metropolitan Trial 
Court (MeTC) of Manila. The respective presiding judges and dates of 
retirement were as follows: Judge Betino Reyes of Branch 4, RTC, on 17 
April 1997; Judge William Bayhon of Branch 23, RTC, on 12 July 1997; and
 Judge Bienvenido Salamanca of Branch 14, MeTC, on 4 February 1997.

As disclosed in the OCA Memorandum dated 4 September 1997, the audit uncovered the following material points:

REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 23, MANILA
  


The Audit Team examined the records of 59 civil cases. Of the said 
cases, two (2) were filed in January 1997, one (1) archived in December 
1996, one (1) decided also in December 1996 and another in January 1997.
 According to the team they found it difficult to reconcile the records 
of cases that were actually examined with the cases recorded/listed in 
the Courtâs Docket Books. Some of those cases the records of which were 
examined were not reflected in the Docket Book while there were pending 
cases listed in the court docket which records [were] deemed considered 
missing inasmuch as the records could not be presented to them. The 
Court does not have an effective system of monitoring the status of 
cases. It was observed that the Docket Book is a useless source of 
determining the true number of cases filed with the Court because of the
 inconclusive entries entered thereon. Likewise, a scan of the Docket 
Book disclosed that from the mid-eighties onwards, there was no 
conscientious recording of the status of quite a number of cases. The 
person in-charge of the civil cases was advised to update the Docket 
Book reflecting therein the outcome or current status of the said cases.

CRIMINAL CASES



The Audit Team was able to physically examine the records of 52 
criminal cases. Of these, two (2) were filed in January 1997, one (1) 
decided and another dismissed also in January 1992. The person 
in-charged [sic] of the Criminal Cases provided the team with a list of 
the 50 pending criminal cases as of November 30, 1996, however, the 
records of some of those included in the list were neither seen nor 
examined by any member of the team and there were records of pending 
cases examined by the team which are not among those listed. The state 
of the Courtâs Docket Book on criminal case[s] is the same as that of 
the civil cases. 


METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 14, MANILA



The number of Pending Cases Including Those Submitted For Decision as
 of December, 1996 as provided by Atty. Igama, Branch Clerk of Court 
thereat are as follows:



Civil Cases   -                92
    

    Criminal Cases              -             948



CIVIL CASES



The Audit Team was able to physically examine the records of only 80 
of the pending civil cases. They were informed by the court employees 
that there are records inside the chambers of Judge Salamanca. Thus, 
they requested repeatedly the Branch Clerk of Court to get the records 
inside the Judgeâs chambers, especially those submitted for decision, so
 that the same may be examined. Much as the Branch Clerk of Court wanted
 to accommodate their request, she reluctantly told them that she is 
unable to bring out the records. Hence, the Team concluded that it was 
Judge Salamanca who did not want to have the records inside his chambers
 to be checked or examined by the team. 


The Civil Cases Whose Records Were Not Physically Examined By the Audit Team are as follows:



        142626 entitled âC & R de Guzman Realty Inc. vs. Eduardo Bernabe, Jr.â, filed on September 24, 1993; 
        147959 entitled âU.P. vs. Erlinda Mangnonâ, filed on April 17, 1995; 
        150146 entitled âCo-Workers Baptist Lot Owners Asso., 
Inc., and/or its members namely: âAntonio I. SeÃ±ora, et. [sic] al. vs. 
Dionisio dela Serna, et. [sic] al.â, filed on February 22, 1996; 
        150494 entitled âManotoil Services Inc., vs. Cipriano Garciaâ filed on February 5, 1996;

On June 10, 1997 the Court took the following measures:



DIRECTED the Branch Clerk of Court, MeTC Manila, Br. 14., Atty. 
Bernarda S. Unera-Igama to report whether or not Judge Bienvenido S. 
Salamanca (Retired) had rendered his decisions in Criminal Cases Nos. 
292000 and 172363 to 172365 and Civil Cases Nos. 148973, 151000, 149961,
 151771, 151007, 150494 and 151573 which were already beyond the 90-day 
reglementary period within which to decide a case; and REQUIRED her to 
report on the status of Civil Cases Nos. 142626, 147959, 150146, 150494,
 150605, 150968, 151475, 154088, 040701, 045022, 051855, 073080, 120634,
 128363 and 142053 whose records were not physically examined by the 
Audit Team. 




DIRECTED Judge William Bayhon, RTC Manila, Br. 23, to: 


1.    RENDER his decision in Civil Cases Nos. 94-69553, 91-59300, 
93-68026, 87-41813, 90-52369, 87-40034, 87-42092, 93-66633, 83-15232, 
94-69717 and 91-57827, which were already beyond the 90-day reglementary
 period within which to decide a case and to SUBMIT PROOF of such 
disposal; and
  


2.    EXPLAIN (a) why no disciplinary action should be taken 
against him for his failure to decide the abovementioned cases within 
the prescribed period; (b) why, despite the lapse of a considerable 
length of time, no action was taken by his court in Civil Cases Nos. 
92-62329, 92-63479, 92-63263, 94-69120, 93-68336, 93-67888, 93-68687, 
95-72743, 92-60715, 95-72867, 93-66933, 93-677721, 91-58374, 95-73057, 
94-70101, 92-61530 and 94-72035, as well as the discrepancies in the 
recording of cases in the courtâs Docket Books; and 


3.    CONDUCT a physical inventory of all the cases assigned to his
 court, making sure that the records of cases reconcile with the cases 
listed in the Docket Book and vice versa, and thereafter to SUBMIT a 
corrected report of cases pending in his sala.
  




In his compliance addressed to the Clerk of Court, en banc, dated 18 July 1997, Judge Bayhon informed the Court, thus:



[P]lease be informed that decisions have already been rendered in 
Civil Cases Nos. 94-69553, 91-59300, 93-68026, 87-41813, 87-40034, 
83-15232, 94-69717 and 91-57827, proofs of which are hereto attached for
 ready reference.
  


It may be noted that the above cases were submitted for decision 
during my incumbency as Executive Judge and considering the volume of 
work as such, I was hardly able to render decisions thereon; hence, the 
lapse [of] the 90-day reglementary period.
  


Civil Cases Nos. 90-52369 and 93-66633 are still on trial and are scheduled on August 1, 1997 and July 21, 1997, respectively.
  


Case No. 87-42092 was raffled to RTC Branch 38, not 23 as verified from the OCC Civil Docket Section.

The corrected record of pending cases as of June 30, 1997 is likewise enclosed.



Plainly, however, Judge Bayhon failed to provide an explanation as 
regards the cases where, as stated in the resolution of 10 June 1997, 
"no court action was taken for a considerable length of time."

Branch Clerk of Court Bernarda S. Umera-Igama as regards the status of 
cases thereat, as follows:

        151573 CV entitled âUniversum Sales, Inc. vs. Rufina Levy Limâ
      


- On October 10, 1996, a Petition for Prohibition and Mandamus
 was filed by the defendant before RTC, Branch 15, Manila, which 
dismissed the same in an order dated December 11, 1996. 


The resolution of the said case by the RTC, Branch 15, Manila was received only on July 14, 1997. 




By way of a resolution dated 7 October 1997, we required Judge 
Salamanca to comment as to why the records of seven (7) cases could no 
longer be found. In the OCA memorandum of 23 February 1998, Judge 
Salamancaâs letter-compliance to the above resolution was summarized, to
 wit: 



040701 entitled âAgus Devât. Corp. vs. Cristina Mendozaâ with motion for reconsideration. 
  045022 entitled âJosefina A. Apostol vs. Feliciano Elbinoâ. 
  051855 entitled â20th Century Hardware Co., Inc. vs. Natividad T. Genatoâ. 
  073082 entitled âBA Finance Corp. vs. Lonita Kuizon, et. [sic] al.â. 
  120634 entitled âJosefa Peralta Subrino vs. Esmeralda Urrutiaâ. 
  128363 entitled âDPG and Management Corp. vs. Mermont Packaging, Inc.â. 
  142053 entitled âErnesto A. Riveral vs. Florencio Guevarraâ. 


He admits however that at the time of audit the same were in his 
possession but it was already impossible to retrieve the same. He claims
 that the records were possibly eaten by termites since their building 
was then leaking, soaking the records with rain water. In fact, he 
added, then Mayor Mel Lopez ordered that their building be condemned and
 was finally bulldozed by the present city authorities.

Judge Salamanca likewise added that he recently went to the new 
office of MeTC, Branch 14, at Sta. Cruz, Manila to locate the said 
records. He was however surprised to see the very sordid state of 
affairs of the said court. The records were allegedly scattered and 
mixed-up. Thus, the improbability of retrieving the records of subject 
cases.



In his Manifestation dated 19 January 1998, Judge Bayhon informed the
 Court that he was submitting this case for resolution on the basis of 
the audit report and his explanation thus filed praying for âleniency,â 
considering that he âacted on the matter prior to his retirement.â

In the resolution of 14 April 1998, the Court considered the case
 against Judge Salamanca submitted for resolution on the basis of the 
audit report and his letter of 14 November 1997.

In its Memorandum, the Office of the Court Administrator noted:



A careful perusal of the records show that Judge William Bayhon, 
RTC, Branch 23, Manila and Judge Salamanca were remiss in the 
performance of their duties when they failed to resolve 11 and 7 cases, 
respectively, within the 90 day reglementary period. This is aside from 
the fact that numerous cases were unacted upon in their salas for a 
considerable length of time without any justifiable explanations.
  


The excuse given by Judge Bayhon that he failed to decide the said 
cases within the prescribed period because of his duties as Executive 
Judge may not be given credence.
  


Administrative Circular No. 6, V, (1-C) dated June 30, 1995, 
provides that xxx âIn case of multiple branches (sala) of more than five
 (5) the distribution of cases shall be in the proportion of one (1) 
case for the Executive Judge and two (2) for each of the other judgesâ. 
Thus, in the raffling alone of cases he shares the least of numbers 
assigned cases. His claim therefore that he has a lot of 
responsibilities as an Executive Judge cannot be countenanced. 


Moreover, as Judges, they should know the cases submitted to them 
for decision or resolution, and are expected to keep their own record of
 cases so that they could act on them promptly without delay. It was 
incumbent upon them to have devised an efficient recording and filing 
system in their court so that no disorderliness have [sic] affected the 
flow of cases and the speedy disposition. Proper and efficient court 
management is their primary responsibility. (Administrative Matter No. 
R-465-MTJ, Nidua vs. Lazaro, June 29, 1989).
  


What aggravated the negligence of these Judges was the fact that 
the decisions/resolutions were subsequently issued only in those 
undecided/unacted cases after an audit ha[d] been conducted. It is 
probable that if there was no judicial inspection the delay would have 
been more considerable or it may even have resulted in the denial of 
justice.
  


The unjustified failure of Judges Bayhon and Salamanca to act on a 
great number of cases is an act of negligence or even dereliction of 
duty. As Judges they should have known that they must always be imbued 
with a sense of duty and responsibility in the discharge of their 
obligation to promptly and properly administer justice.
  




As to Judge Salamancaâs explanation in his letter of 14 November 
1997, the Office of the Court Administrator in its Memorandum of 23 
February 1998 observed:



A perusal of the letter of Judge Salamanca shows that he has been 
remiss in the performance of his duties. The excuse he proffered, 
particularly on the sorry state of his sala and the vulnerability of the
 court records to be destroyed and/or misplaced do not inspire 
compassion. On the contrary, it revealed his inefficiency in securing 
the records of the cases assigned to him. In fact, by his own admission,
 the records of the cases might have been in his possession on audit 
date, yet he has [sic] not done anything to inspect its [sic] status. 
Moreover, if indeed it was [sic] irretrievable, why were there no 
efforts exerted on his part to reconstruct the same, since he knew there
 were probable pending incidents for his resolution/s. This were [sic] 
however totally ignored by Judge Salamanca till he was directed to 
return the said case records.
  


Time and again the Honorable Court stressed that: The Court will 
not tolerate the serious misconduct of a Judge nor will absolve him on 
account of the excuses he advanced. In accepting his Office, he took in 
the responsibilities necessarily attached to such exalted position. He 
is mandate to abide by the rules without condition and must, at all 
times exercise extreme caution so as not to commit an injustice to those
 who seek refuge under the very law he has sworn to uphold. (Serafin 
Castillo vs. Judge Liberato C. Cortes, 234 SCRA 398). 
  




The Office of the Court Administrator thus recommended that the Court
 IMPOSE: (a) a Fine of P50,000.00 on Judge Bayhon for his failure to 
decide seven (7) cases within the reglementary period of 90 days, 
likewise considering his failure to act on seventeen (17) cases for a 
considerable length of time; and (b) a Fine of P50,000.00 on Judge 
Salamanca for his failure to decide fifteen (15) cases within the 
reglementary period of 90 days and for keeping the records of seven (7) 
cases even after his retirement. 

We are in full accord with the findings of facts and the 
conclusions as to the administrative liabilities of Judges William 
Bayhon and Bienvenido Salamanca. However, as hereafter discussed, we opt
 to impose reduced penalties. 

Canons 2, 6 and 31 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics, provide, 
respectively, that the âadministration of justice should be speedy and 
careful;â that judges âshould be prompt in disposing of all matters 
submitted to [them], remembering that justice delayed is often justice 
denied;â and that in the discharge of his judicial duties, a judge 
âshould be conscientious ... [and] thorough .â¦â While Rule 3.05 of Canon
 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct expressly directs that a judge should
 dispose of the courtâs business âpromptly and decide cases within the 
required period.â In this regard, Section 15(1) of Article VIII of the 
Constitution mandates:



(1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this 
Constitution must be decided or resolved within ... three months for all
 other lower courts. 
  




Needless to say, any delay in the determination or resolution of a 
case, no matter how insignificant the case may seem to a judge, is, at 
bottom, delay in the administration of justice in general. The suffering
 endured by just one person â whether plaintiff, defendant or accused --
 while awaiting a judgment that may affect his life, honor, liberty or 
property, taints the entire judiciaryâs performance in its solemn task 
of administering justice. Inefficient, indolent or neglectful judges are
 as equally impermissible in the judiciary as the incompetent and 
dishonest ones. Any of them tarnishes the image of the judiciary or 
brings it to public contempt, dishonor or disrespect and must then be 
administratively dealt with or criminally prosecuted, if warranted, and 
punished accordingly.

In this case, both Judges Bayhon and Salamanca committed gross 
inefficiency and neglect of duty in failing to decide seven (7) and 
fifteen (15) cases, respectively, within the reglementary period of 
ninety days (
Bentulan v. Dumatol
, 233 SCRA 168 [1994]); 
additionally, the former failed to act on seventeen (17) cases for a 
considerable length of time. The failure of Judge Bayhon to decide the 
seven (7) cases within the reglementary period was, according to him, 
due to the fact that he was then the Executive Judge. By his proffered 
excuse, however, what escapes him is the fact that said designation was a
 privilege and a form of recognition of his leadership qualities, and 
did not excuse him from complying with his constitutional duty to decide
 cases within ninety (90) days from the time they were deemed submitted 
for decision. On the contrary, much was demanded from him for, as 
Executive Judge, he was expected to be a role model for his peers.

As to Judge Salamanca, his gross inefficiency and neglect of duty was compounded by another act of graver malfeasance, 
viz
.,
 removal of the records of seven (7) cases and keeping them even after 
his retirement. Section 14 of Rule 136 expressly provides that â(n)o 
record shall be taken from the clerkâs office without an order of the 
court except as otherwise provided by these rules.â Further, it must be 
stressed that Article 226 of the Revised Penal Code punishes any public 
officer who removes, conceals or destroys documents or papers officially
 entrusted to him.

Considering, however, that Judges Bayhon and Salamanca have no 
prior record of adverse disciplinary actions taken against them, coupled
 with the fact of their retirements, a reduction of the penalties 
recommended by the OCA is in order. Thus, for their gross inefficiency 
and neglect of duty, Judges Bayhon and Salamanca are each fined Ten 
Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos. Then, as an additional penalty for having 
kept the records of seven (7) cases even after his retirement, Judge 
Salamanca is further fined the amount of Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) 
Pesos.

Finally, the Court noted from the findings of the audit team that
 insofar as civil cases were concerned, Branch 23 of the RTC of Manila 
âdoes not have an effective system of monitoring the status of cases ...
 [t]he Docket Book is a useless source of determining the true number of
 cases filed ... because of the inconclusive entries thereon. Likewise, a
 scan of the Docket Book disclosed that from the mid-eighties onwards, 
there was no conscientious recording of the status of quite a number of 
cases ....â While as to criminal cases, the team found that â[t]he state
 of the courtâs Docket Book on criminal case[s] is the same as that of 
the civil cases.â

As regards Branch 14 of the MeTC of Manila, the audit team reported:



The Audit Team was able to physically examine the records of only 
80 of the pending civil cases. They were informed by the Court employees
 that there are records inside the chambers of Judge Salamanca. Thus, 
they requested repeatedly the Branch Clerk of Court to get the records 
inside the Judgeâs chambers, especially those submitted for decision, so
 that the same may be examined. Much as the Branch Clerk of Court wanted
 to accommodate their request, she reluctantly told them that she is 
unable to bring out the records. Hence, the Team concluded that it was 
Judge Salamanca who did not want to have the records inside his chambers
 to be checked or examined. 




Two things are immediately clear from these findings, viz., (a) a 
prima facie

 showing of neglect or inefficiency on the part of the clerks of court 
concerned; and (b) helplessness on the part of the audit team when faced
 with an uncooperative branch clerk of court.

Clerks of Courts are, among other things, required to: (1) safely
 keep all records, papers, files, exhibits and public property committed
 to his charge, including the library of the court, and the seals and 
furniture belonging to his office (Sec. 7, Rule 136, Rules of Court); 
and (2) keep a general docket, each page of which shall be numbered and 
prepared for receiving all the entries in a single case, and shall enter
 therein all cases, numbered consecutively in the order in which they 
were received, and, under the heading of each case and a complete title 
thereof, the date of each paper filed or issued, of each order or 
judgment entered, and of each other step taken in the case, so that by 
reference to a single page the history of the case may be seen (Sec. 8, 
id
.).

In not keeping the records of the cases the audit team wanted to 
examine in her office or allowing the records to be kept in the chambers
 of the Judge without any written proof, such as a receipt, showing that
 these were properly taken from the formerâs custody, the Branch Clerk 
of Court of Branch 14 of the MeTC of Manila, Atty. Bernarda S. 
Unera-Igama, may have violated Section 7 of Rule 136. In like manner, on
 the basis of the report, the Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 23 of the 
RTC of Manila failed to comply with Section 8 of Rule 136.

Both Branch Clerks of Court must then be required to show cause 
why no disciplinary action should be taken against them for the 
aforementioned misfeasance or malfeasance.

Anent the 
helplessness
 of the audit team, it is an 
opportune time to remind clerks of courts and other personnel of lower 
courts that a judicial audit is not an idle ceremony. It is conducted by
 the Office of the Court Administrator as the principal arm of this 
Court in the performance of its constitutional duty to exercise 
administrative supervision over all lower courts. Accordingly, clerks of
 courts and other personnel must fully cooperate with and support the 
audit teams. On the other hand, the audit teams must not simply back 
down or concede when faced by a hostile environment and desist from 
conducting or completing the audit. They must forthwith report the 
matter to the Court through the Office of the Court Administrator so 
that appropriate action may be taken against uncooperative clerks of 
courts or other personnel.

WHEREFORE
, for gross inefficiency and neglect of
 duty, Judges William Bayhon, former presiding judge of Branch 23, 
Regional Trial Court of Manila, and Judge Bienvenido Salamanca, former 
presiding judge of Branch 14, Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, are

 additional fine of TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00) is hereby imposed on
 Judge Salamanca to be paid within the same period. 

The fines may be deducted from the retirement benefits due to Judges William Bayhon and Bienvenido Salamanca.

 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, and the Branch Clerk of 
Court of Branch 23 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila are hereby
