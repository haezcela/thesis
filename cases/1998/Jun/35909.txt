BELLOSILLO, J.:Â 


This petition for review seeks the reversal of the decision of 
respondent Court of Appeals of 16 January 1996 in CA-G.R. CV Case No. 
37273, "
Cresencia Cristobal, et al. v. Cesar Ledesma, Inc., et al.,
"
[1]
 which affirmed in toto the decision of the RTC-Br. 81, Quezon City,
[2]

 dismissing herein petitionersâ complaint for easement of right of way, 
and the Resolution of 14 June 1996 denying their motion for 
reconsideration.

Petitioners own a house and lot situated at No. 10 Visayas Avenue
 Extension, Quezon City, where they have been residing from 1961 to the 
present. Respondent Cesar Ledesma, Inc., on the other hand, is the owner
 of a subdivision at Barrio Culiat along Visayas Avenue which once 
included the disputed residential lots, Lot 1 and Lot 2, with areas of 
164 square meters and 52 square meters, respectively, located adjacent 
to petitionersâ property. Lots 1 and 2 were originally part of a private
 road known as Road Lot 2 owned exclusively by Cesar Ledesma, Inc. 
Petitioners were using Road Lot 2 in going to and from the nearest 
public road. When Visayas Avenue became operational as a national road 
in 1979, Cesar Ledesma, Inc., filed a petition before the RTC of Quezon 
City to be allowed to convert Road Lot 2 into residential lots.
[3]

 The petition was granted, hence, Road Lot 2 was converted into 
residential lots designated as Lot 1 and Lot 2. Subsequently, Cesar 
Ledesma, Inc., sold both lots to Macario Pacione in whose favor Transfer
 Certificates of Title were correspondingly issued. In turn, Macario 
Pacione conveyed the lots to his son and daughter-in-law, respondent 
spouses Jesus and Lerma Pacione. 

When the Pacione spouses, who intended to build a house on Lot 1,
 visited the property in 1987, they found out that the lot was occupied 
by a squatter named Juanita Geronimo and a portion was being used as a 
passageway by petitioners to and from Visayas Avenue. Accordingly, the 
spouses complained about the intrusion into their property to the 
Barangay Office. At the barangay conciliation proceeding, petitioners 
offered to pay for the use of a portion of Lot 1 as passageway but the 
Pacione spouses rejected the offer. When the parties failed to arrive at
 an amicable settlement, the spouses started enclosing Lot 1 with a 
concrete fence.

Petitioners protested the enclosure alleging that their property 
was bounded on all sides by residential houses belonging to different 
owners and had no adequate outlet and inlet to Visayas Avenue except 
through the property of the Paciones. As their protests went unheeded, 
petitioners instituted an action for easement of right of way with 
prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO).

On 3 June 1987 the trial court issued a TRO directing the Pacione
 spouses to cease and desist from fencing the disputed property. The 
Paciones objected arguing that petitioners were not entitled to a TRO 
since they showed no valid basis for its issuance, and that petitioners 
had no cause of action against respondents because there were actually 
two (2) accessible outlets and inlets - a pathway right in front of 
their gate leading towards an asphalted 5-meter road to the left, and 
across an open space to the right adjacent to respondentsâ lot likewise 
leading to Visayas Avenue. 

At the instance of the parties, the trial court ordered an ocular
 inspection of the property. A Board of Commissioners was constituted 
for that purpose composed of representatives chosen by the parties, with
 Deputy Sheriff Florencio D. Dela Cruz, Jr., as representative of the 
court. 

On 3 January 1990 Deputy Sheriff Dela Cruz, Jr., submitted his Report
[4]
 relative to the ocular inspection on the litigated lots -



x x x there is another way from the Visayas Ave. to the plaintiffsâ
 lot existing at the time of the ocular inspection. Plaintiffs can use 
the street originating from Visayas Avenue, identified as Ma. Elena St.,
 which is about 2.5 m. in width and about 150 m. in length up to an 
intersection, meeting a private road, which is about 100 meters in 
length, that ends at the lower portion of the right side of the adjacent
 vacant lot previously identified, and at the back of a lot with 
concrete fence located at the back of the plaintiffsâ property. From 
that point the plaintiff must enter the adjacent vacant lot (entry to 
the said lot is still possible during the ocular inspection because the 
barbed wires were not properly placed) to reach a gate at the side of 
the plaintiffsâ lot, about 16 m. from the end of the private road, 
allegedly used by the plaintiffs before the adjacent lot was enclosed by
 barbed wires. According to Atty. Mendoza, counsel for the defendants, 
that gate no longer exist(ed) at the time of the ocular inspection. 




As may be observed from the above report, only one outlet was 
indicated by Sheriff Dela Cruz, Jr. The other outlet across an open 
space to the right referred to by the Pacione spouses was not reflected 
thereon. However, on the basis of the report as well as the testimonial 
and documentary evidence of the parties, the trial court dismissed the 
complaint holding that one essential requisite of a legal easement of 
right of way was not proved, i.e., the absence of an alternative 
adequate way or outlet to a public highway, in this case, Visayas 
Avenue.
[5]


Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals arguing that the 
trial court erred in finding that they failed to sufficiently establish 
the essential fact that from their property no adequate outlet or access
 to a public highway existed; and, that the conversion of the Road Lot 
into two (2) residential lots by Cesar Ledesma, Inc., was violative of 
PD No. 957, hence illegal, and the titles issued as a consequence of the
 conversion were null and void.

On 16 January 1996 the Court of Appeals rendered its assailed decision affirming the findings of the trial court - 



The burden of proving the existence of the requisites of easement 
of right of way lies on the owner of the dominant estate. In the case at
 bar, plaintiff-appellants failed to prove that there is no adequate 
outlet from their property to a public highway. Convenience of the 
dominant estate is not a gauge for the grant of compulsory right of way.
 The true standard for the grant of the legal right is âadequacy.â 
Hence, when there is already an existing adequate outlet from the 
dominant estate to a public highway, as in this case, even if the 
outlet, for one reason or another, be inconvenient, the need to open up 
another servitude is entirely unjustified. To justify the imposition of 
an easement of right of way, there must be real, not fictitious or 
artificial necessity for it. A right of way is legally demandable, but 
the owner of the dominant estate is not at liberty to impose one based 
on arbitrary choice. Art. 650 of the Civil Code provides for the 
criteria in the establishment of such easement but it has been settled 
that the criterion of âleast prejudicialâ prevails over shortest 
distance. Each case must be weighed according to its individual merits 
and judged according to the sound discretion of the court (
Costabella Corporation v. Court of Appeals
, G.R. No. 80511, 193 SCRA 333 [1991]).
  


The second assigned error has no legal leg to stand on since 
plaintiff-appellants cannot just introduce a new issue to an already 
settled one, especially for the first time on appeal.
  




Their motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioners now come to us with the following assignment of errors: 
First
, the Court of Appeals erred in applying the doctrine in 
Costabella
,
 considering that in the instant case the four (4) requisites that must 
be complied with by an owner of the dominant estate in order to validly 
claim a compulsory right of way have been clearly established by 
petitioners, contrary to the Decision appealed from, and that the facts 
in 
Costabella
 are not the same as in the present case. 
Second
,
 the Court of Appeals seriously erred in holding that the question of 
legality or illegality of the conversion of Road Lot 2 into two (2) 
residential lots by the Cesar Ledesma, Inc., is a new issue raised for 
the first time on appeal, because such issue appeared in the complaint 
filed before the trial court.

Quite noticeably, petitionersâ first assigned error is 
essentially factual in nature, i.e., it merely assails the factual 
findings of both the Court of Appeals and the trial court. Basic is the 
rule in this jurisdiction that only questions of law may be raised in a 
petition for review under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. 
The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases brought to it from the 
Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing errors of law, the findings of 
fact of the appellate court being conclusive.
[6]

 We have emphatically declared that it is not the function of this Court
 to analyze or weigh such evidence all over again, its jurisdiction 
being limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by
 the lower court.
[7]


Petitioners insist that their petition raises a question of law, 
that is, the correctness of the appellate courtâs ruling that one who 
has an existing passageway, however inconvenient that passageway may be,
 is no longer entitled to an easement of right of way. 

We do not agree. Questions of law are those that do not call for 
any examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the 
parties.
[8]
 In the instant 
case, petitioners' assignment of errors would have this Court go over 
the facts because it necessarily entails an examination of the evidence 
and its subsequent re-evaluation to determine whether petitioners indeed
 have no sufficient outlet to the highway.

Petitioners next claim that the findings of the appellate court 
are based on misapprehension of facts, which circumstance warrants a 
review of the appellate courtâs decision. Yet, they failed to 
sufficiently demonstrate this allegation in their pleadings. Absent a 
clear showing that the findings complained of are totally devoid of 
support in the record, or that they are so glaringly erroneous as to 
constitute serious abuse of discretion, such findings must stand. 

At any rate, even assuming that the first assignment of error may
 be properly raised before this Court, we find no reversible error in 
the assailed decision. To be entitled to a compulsory easement of right 
of way, the preconditions provided under Arts. 649 and 650 of the Civil 
Code must be established. These are: (1) that the dominant estate is 
surrounded by other immovables and has no adequate outlet to a public 
highway; (2) that proper indemnity has been paid; (3) that the isolation
 was not due to acts of the proprietor of the dominant estate; (4) that 
the right of way claimed is at a point least prejudicial to the servient
 estate and, in so far as consistent with this rule, where the distance 
from the dominant estate to a public highway may be the shortest.
[9]
 The burden of proving the existence of these prerequisites lies on the owner of the dominant estate.
[10]


In the present case, the first element is clearly absent. As 
found by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, an outlet already 
exists, which is a path walk located at the left side of petitionersâ 
property and which is connected to a private road about five hundred 
(500) meters long. The private road, in turn, leads to Ma. Elena Street 
which is about 2.5 meters wide and, finally, to Visayas Avenue. This 
outlet was determined by the court a quo to be sufficient for the needs 
of the dominant estate, hence petitioners have no cause to complain that
 they have no adequate outlet to Visayas Avenue.

Further, no evidence was adduced by petitioners to prove that the
 easement they seek to impose on private respondentsâ property is to be 
established at a point least prejudicial to the servient estate. For 
emphasis, Lot 1 is only 164 square meters and an improvident imposition 
of the easement on the lot may unjustly deprive private respondents of 
the optimum use and enjoyment of their property, considering that its 
already small area will be reduced further by the easement. Worse, it 
may even render the property useless for the purpose for which private 
respondents purchased the same.

It must also be stressed that, by its very nature, and when 
considered with reference to the obligations imposed on the servient 
estate, an easement involves an abnormal restriction on the property 
rights of the servient owner and is regarded as a charge or encumbrance 
on the servient estate. Thus, it is incumbent upon the owner of the 
dominant estate to establish by clear and convincing evidence the 
presence of all the preconditions before his claim for easement of right
 of way may be granted. Petitioners miserably failed in this regard.

On the question of adequacy of the existing outlet, petitioners 
allege that the path walk is much longer, circuitous and inconvenient, 
as from Visayas Avenue one has to pass by Ma. Elena St., turn right to a
 private road, then enter a vacant lot, and turn right again to exit 
from the vacant lot until one reaches petitionersâ property.

We find petitionersâ concept of what is "adequate outlet" a 
complete disregard of the well-entrenched doctrine that in order to 
justify the imposition of an easement of right of way there must be a 
real, not fictitious or artificial, necessity for it. Mere convenience 
for the dominant estate is not what is required by law as the basis for 
setting up a compulsory easement. Even in the face of necessity, if it 
can be satisfied without imposing the easement, the same should not be 
imposed.
[11]


Thus, in 
Ramos v. Gatchalian
,
[12]

 this Court disallowed the easement prayed for - even if petitioner 
therein "had to pass through lots belonging to other owners, as 
temporary ingress and egress, which lots were grassy, cogonal and 
greatly inconvenient due to flood and mud" - because it would run 
counter to the prevailing jurisprudence that mere convenience for the 
dominant estate does not suffice to serve as basis for the easement.

Also, in 
Floro v. Llenado
,
[13]

 we refused to impose an easement of right of way over petitionerâs 
property, although private respondentâs alternative route was admittedly
 inconvenient because he had to traverse 
several
 rice lands and
 rice paddies belonging to different persons, not to mention that said 
passage, as found by the trial court, was impassable during rainy 
season.

Admittedly, the proposed right of way over private respondentsâ 
property is the most convenient, being the shorter and the more direct 
route to Visayas Avenue. However, it is not enough that the easement be 
where the way is 
shortest
. It is more important that it be where it will cause the 
least prejudice
 to the servient estate.
[14]

 As discussed elsewhere, petitioners failed to sufficiently demonstrate 
that the proposed right of way shall be at a point least prejudicial to 
the servient estate. 

The second assignment of error was likewise properly rejected by 
the appellate court. Primarily, the issue of legality or illegality of 
the conversion of the road lot in question has long been laid to rest in
 LRC Case No. Q-1614
[15]
 which
 declared with finality the legality of the segregation subdivision 
survey plan of the disputed road lot. Consequently, it is now too late 
for petitioners to question the validity of the conversion of the road 
lot. 

Finally, questions relating to non-compliance with the requisites
 for conversion of subdivision lots are properly cognizable by the 
National Housing Authority (NHA), now the Housing and Land Use 
Regulatory Board (HLURB), pursuant to Sec. 22 of PD 957
[16]
 and not by the regular courts. Under the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction,
[17]

 where jurisdiction is vested upon an administrative body, no resort to 
the courts may be made before such administrative body shall have acted 
upon the matter.

1996 Decision and the 14 June 1996 Resolution of the Court of Appeals
