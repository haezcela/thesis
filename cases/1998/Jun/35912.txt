[ G.R. No. 124013, June 05, 1998 ]


ROSARIO MANEJA, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND MANILA MIDTOWN HOTEL, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


Assailed in this petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court are the Resolution
[1]
 dated June 3, 1994 of the respondent National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC NCR-00-10-05297-90, entitled "Rosario Maneja, 
Complainant
, vs. Manila Midtown Hotel, 
Respondent
,"
 which dismissed the illegal dismissal case filed by petitioner against 
private respondent company for lack of jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter
 over the case; and its Resolution
[2]
 dated October 20, 1995 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.

Petitioner Rosario Maneja worked with private respondent Manila 
Midtown Hotel beginning January, 1985 as a telephone operator. She was a
 member of the National Union of Workers in Hotels, Restaurants and 
Allied Industries (NUWHRAIN) with an existing Collective Bargaining 
Agreement (CBA) with private respondent.

In the afternoon of February 13, 1990, a fellow telephone 
operator, Rowena Loleng received a Request for Long Distance Call (RLDC)
 form and a deposit of P500.00 from a page boy of the hotel for a call 
by a Japanese guest named Hirota Ieda. The call was unanswered. The 
P500.00 deposit was forwarded to the cashier. In the evening, Ieda again
 made an RLDC and the page boy collected another P500.00 which was also 
given to the operator Loleng. The second call was also unanswered. 
Loleng passed on the RLDC to petitioner for follow-up. Petitioner 
monitored the call.

On February 15, 1990, a hotel cashier inquired about the 
P1,000.00 deposit made by Ieda. After a search, Loleng found the first 
deposit of P500.00 inserted in the guest folio while the second deposit 
was eventually discovered inside the folder for cancelled calls with 
deposit and official receipts.

When petitioner saw that the second RLDC form was not 
time-stamped, she immediately placed it inside the machine which stamped
 the date âFebruary 15, 1990.â Realizing that the RLDC was filed 2 days 
earlier, she wrote and changed the date to February 13, 1990. Loleng 
then delivered the RLDC and the money to the cashier. The second deposit
 of P500.00 by Ieda was later returned to him.

On March 7, 1990, the chief telephone operator issued a memorandum
[3]

 to petitioner and Loleng directing the two to explain the February 15 
incident. Petitioner and Loleng thereafter submitted their written 
explanation.
[4]


On March 20, 1990, a written report
[5]

 was submitted by the chief telephone operator, with the recommendation 
that the offenses committed by the operators concerned covered 
violations of the Offenses Subject to Disciplinary Actions (OSDA): (1) 
OSDA 2.01: forging, falsifying official document(s), and (2) OSDA 1.11: 
culpable carelessness - negligence or failure to follow specific 
instruction(s) or established procedure(s).

On March 23, 1990, petitioner was served a notice of dismissal
[6]
 effective April 1, 1990. Petitioner refused to sign the notice and wrote therein "under protest."

Meanwhile, a criminal case
[7]

 for Falsification of Private Documents and Qualified Theft was filed 
before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila by private respondent
 against Loleng and petitioner. However, the resolution recommending the
 filing of a case for estafa was reversed by 2nd Asst. City Prosecutor 
Virgilio M. Patag.

On October 2, 1990, petitioner filed a complaint for illegal 
dismissal against private respondent before the Labor Arbiter. The 
complaint was later amended to include a claim for unpaid wages, unpaid 
vacation leave conversion and moral damages.

Position papers were filed by the parties. Thereafter, the motion
 to set the case for hearing filed by private respondent was granted by 
the Labor Arbiter and trial on the merits ensued.

In his decision
[8]
 
dated May 29, 1992, Labor Arbiter Oswald Lorenzo found that the 
petitioner was illegally dismissed. However, in the decision, the Labor 
Arbiter stated that:



âPreliminarily, we hereby state that on the face of the instant 
complaint, it is one that revolves on the matter of the implementation 
and interpretation of existing company policies, which per the last par.
 of Art. 217 of the Labor Code, as amended, is one within the 
jurisdictional ambit of the grievance procedure under the CBA and 
thereafter, if unresolved, one proper for voluntary arbitration. This 
observation is re-entrenched by the fact, that complainant claims she is
 a member of NUWHRAIN with an existing CBA with respondent hotel. 


On this score alone, this case should have been dismissed outright.â
[9]
 




Despite the aforequoted preliminary statement, the Labor Arbiter 
still assumed jurisdiction âsince Labor Arbiters under Article 217 of 
the same Labor Code, are conferred original and exclusive jurisdiction 
of all termination case(sic.).â The dispositive portion of the decision 
states that:



"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: 




(1) Declaring complainant's dismissal by respondent hotel as illegally effected; 


(2) Ordering respondent to immediately reinstate complainant to her previous position without loss of seniority rights; 


(3) Ordering further respondent to pay complainant the full backwages due her, which is computed as follows: 


3/23/90 - 10/31/90 = 7.26/mos.
        

        P2,540 x 7.26/mos.                      P18,440.40 


11/1/90 - 1/7/91 = 2.23/mos.
        

        P3,224.16 x 2.23/mos.                     7,189.87 


1/8/91 - 4/29/92 = 15.7/mos.
        

        P3,589.16 x 15.7/mos.                                          
56,349.89

                                                                          P81,980.08 


(4) Moreover, respondent is ordered to pay the 13th month pay due
 the complainant in the amount of P6,831.67 including moral and 
exemplary damages of P15,000.00 and P10,000.00 respectively, as well as 
attorney's fees equivalent to ten (10) percent of the total award herein
 in the amount of P11,381.17;
    


(5) Finally, all other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.
    




"SO ORDERED."
  





Private respondent appealed the decision to the respondent commission on the ground 
inter alia
 that the Labor Arbiter erred in â
assuming
 jurisdiction over the illegal dismissal case after finding that the 
case falls within the jurisdictional ambit of the grievance procedure 
under the CBA, and if unresolved, proper for voluntary arbitration
.â
[10]
 An Opposition
[11]
 was filed by petitioner.

In the assailed Resolution
[12]

 dated June 3, 1994, respondent NLRC dismissed the illegal dismissal 
case for lack of jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter because the same 
should have instead been subjected to voluntary arbitration.

Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration
[13]
 was denied by respondent NLRC for lack of merit.

In this petition for certiorari, petitioner ascribes to respondent NLRC grave abuse of discretion in -

Ruling that the Labor Arbiter was without jurisdiction over the illegal dismissal case; 
Not ruling that private respondent is estopped by laches from 
questioning the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter over the illegal 
dismissal case; 
Reversing the decision of the Labor Arbiter based on a technicality notwithstanding the merits of the case. 


Petitioner contends that Article 217(a)(2) and (c) relied upon by 
respondent NLRC in divesting the labor arbiter of jurisdiction over the 
illegal dismissal case, should be read in conjunction with Article 261
[14]

 of the Labor Code. It is the view of petitioner that termination cases 
arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel 
policies pertaining to violations of Offenses Subject to Disciplinary 
Actions (OSDA), are under the jurisdiction of the voluntary arbitrator 
only if these are unresolved in the plant-level grievance machinery. 
Petitioner insists that her termination is not an unresolved grievance 
as there has been no grievance meeting between the NUWHRAIN union and 
the management. The reason for this, petitioner adds, is that it has 
been a company practice that termination cases are not anymore referred 
to the grievance machinery but directly to the labor arbiter.

In its comment, private respondent argues that the Labor Arbiter 
should have dismissed the illegal dismissal case outright after finding 
that it is within the jurisdictional ambit of the grievance procedure. 
Moreover, private respondent states that the issue of jurisdiction may 
be raised at any time and at any stage of the proceedings even on 
appeal, and is not in estoppel by laches as contended by the petitioner.

For its part, public respondent, through the Office of the 
Solicitor General, cited the ruling of this Court in Sanyo Philippines 
Workers Union-PSSLU vs. CaÃ±izares
[15]
 in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter.

The legal issue in this case is whether or not the Labor Arbiter has jurisdiction over the illegal dismissal case.

The respondent Commission, in holding that the Labor Arbiter 
lacks jurisdiction to hear the illegal dismissal case, cited as basis 
therefor Article 217 of the Labor Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 
6715. It said:



âWhile it is conceded that under Article 217(a), Labor Arbiters 
shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving 
âtermination disputes,â the Supreme Court, in a fairly recent case 
ruled: 




âThe procedure introduced in RA 6715 of referring certain 
grievances originally and exclusively to the grievance machinery, and 
when not settled at this level, to a panel of voluntary arbitrators 
outlined in CBAs does not only include grievances arising from the 
interpretation or implementation of the CBA but applies as well to those
 arising from the implementation of company personnel policies. No other
 body shall take cognizance of these cases. x x x.â (Sanyo vs. 
CaÃ±izares, 211 SCRA 361, 372)â
[16]








We find that the respondent Commission has erroneously interpreted 
the aforequoted portion of our ruling in the case of Sanyo, as divesting
 the Labor Arbiter of jurisdiction in a termination dispute. 

Article 217 of the Labor Code gives us the clue as to the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter, to wit:



Article 217. 
Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the Commission
.
 a) Except as otherwise provided under this Code the Labor Arbiters 
shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide within
 thirty (30) calendar days after the submission of the case by the 
parties for decision without extension even in the absence of 
stenographic notes, the following cases involving all workers, whether 
agricultural or non-agricultural:
  


Unfair labor practice cases; 
 Termination disputes; 
 If accompanied with a claim for reinstatement, those cases that 
workers may file involving wages, rates of pay, hours of work and other 
terms and conditions of employment; 
 Claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from the employer-employee relations; 
 Cases arising from any violation of Article 264 of this Code, 
including questions involving the legality of strikes and lockouts; 
 Except claims for Employees Compensation, Social Security, 
Medicare and maternity benefits, all other claims, arising from 
employer-employee relations, including those of persons in domestic or 
household service, involving an amount exceeding five thousand pesos 
(P5,000.00) regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for 
reinstatement. 


b) The Commission shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters.

c) Cases arising from the interpretation or implementation of 
collective bargaining agreements and those arising from the 
interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies shall be 
disposed of by the Labor Arbiter by referring the same to the grievance 
machinery and voluntary arbitration as may be provided in said 
agreements.â



As can be seen from the aforequoted Article, termination cases fall 
under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter. It 
should be noted, however, that in the opening paragraph there appears 
the phrase: âExcept as otherwise provided under this Code x x x.â It is 
paragraph (c) of the same Article which respondent Commission has 
erroneously interpreted as giving the voluntary arbitrator jurisdiction 
over the illegal dismissal case.

However, Article 217 (c) should be read in conjunction with 
Article 261 of the Labor Code which grants to voluntary arbitrators 
original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide all 
unresolved grievances

 arising from the interpretation or implementation of the collective 
bargaining agreement and those arising from the interpretation or 
enforcement of company personnel policies. Note the phrase âunresolved 
grievances.â In the case at bar, the termination of petitioner is not an
 unresolved grievance.

The stance of the Solicitor General in the 
Sanyo
 case is totally the reverse of its posture in the case at bar. In 
Sanyo
,
 the Solicitor General was of the view that a distinction should be made
 between a case involving âinterpretation or implementation of 
Collective Bargaining Agreementâ or interpretation or âenforcementâ of 
company personnel policies, on the one hand and a case involving 
termination, on the other hand. It argued that the dismissal of the 
private respondents does not involve an âinterpretation or 
implementationâ of a Collective Bargaining Agreement or âinterpretation 
or enforcementâ of company personnel policies but involves 
âtermination.â The Solicitor General further said that where the dispute
 is just in the interpretation, implementation or enforcement stage, it 
may be referred to the grievance machinery set up in the Collective 
Bargaining Agreement or by voluntary arbitration. Where there was 
already actual termination, i.e., violation of rights, it is already 
cognizable by the Labor Arbiter.
[17]
 We fully agree with the theory of the Solicitor General in the 
Sanyo
 case, which is radically apposite to its position in this case.

Moreover, the dismissal of petitioner does not fall within the 
phrase âgrievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of 
collective bargaining agreement and those arising from the 
interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies,â the 
jurisdiction of which pertains to the grievance machinery or thereafter,
 to a voluntary arbitrator or panel of voluntary arbitrators. It is to 
be stressed that under Article 260 of the Labor Code, which explains the
 function of the grievance machinery and voluntary arbitrator, â(T)he 
parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall include therein 
provisions that will ensure the mutual observance of its terms and 
conditions. They shall establish a machinery for the adjustment and 
resolution of grievances arising from the interpretation or 
implementation of their Collective Bargaining Agreement and those 
arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel 
policies.â Article 260 further provides that the parties to a CBA shall 
name or designate their respective representative to the grievance 
machinery and if the grievance is unsettled in that level, it shall 
automatically be referred to the voluntary arbitrators designated in 
advance by the parties to a CBA of the union and the company. It can 
thus be deduced that only disputes involving the union and the company 
shall be referred to the grievance machinery or voluntary arbitrators.
[18]


In the case at bar, the union does not come into the picture, not
 having objected or voiced any dissent to the dismissal of the herein 
petitioner. The reason for this, according to petitioner is that âthe 
practice in said Hotel in cases of termination is that the latter cases 
are not referred anymore to the grievance committee;â and that âthe 
terminated employee who wishes to question the legality of his 
termination usually goes to the Labor Arbiter for arbitration, whether 
the termination arose from the interpretation or enforcement of the 
company personnel policies or otherwise.â
[19]


As we ruled in 
Sanyo
, âSince there has been an actual 
termination, the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Labor 
Arbiter.â The aforequoted doctrine is applicable foursquare in 
petitionerâs case. The dismissal of the petitioner does not call for the
 interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies but is a 
termination dispute which comes under the jurisdiction of the Labor 
Arbiter.

It should be explained that âcompany personnel policiesâ are 
guiding principles stated in broad, long-range terms that express the 
philosophy or beliefs of an organizationâs top authority regarding 
personnel matters. They deal with matters affecting efficiency and 
well-being of employees and include, among others, the procedure in the 
administration of wages, benefits, promotions, transfer and other 
personnel movements which are usually not spelled out in the collective 
agreement. The usual source of grievances, however, are the rules and 
regulations governing disciplinary actions.
[20]


The case of Pantranco North Express, Inc. vs. NLRC
[21]

 sheds further light on the issue of jurisdiction where the Court cited 
the Sanyo case and quoted the decision of therein Labor Arbiter Olairez 
in this manner:



âIn our honest opinion we have jurisdiction over the complaint on the following grounds: 


First, this is a complaint of illegal dismissal of which original 
and exclusive jurisdiction under Article 217 has been conferred to the 
Labor Arbiters. The interpretation of the CBA or enforcement of the 
company policy is only corollary to the complaint of illegal dismissal. 
Otherwise, an employee who was on AWOL, or who committed offenses 
contrary to the personnel policies(sic) can no longer file a case of 
illegal dismissal because the discharge is premised on the 
interpretation or enforcement of the company policies(sic).
  


Second. Respondent voluntarily submitted the case to the 
jurisdiction of this labor tribunal. It adduced arguments to the 
legality of its act, whether such act may be retirement and/or 
dismissal, and prayed for reliefs on the merits of the case. A litigant 
cannot pray for reliefs on the merits and at the same time attacks(sic) 
the jurisdiction of the tribunal. A person cannot have oneâs cake and 
eat it too. x x x.â 
  




As to the second ground, petitioner correctly points out that 
respondent NLRC should have ruled that private respondent is estopped by
 laches in questioning the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter.

Clearly, estoppel lies. The issue of jurisdiction was mooted by 
herein private respondentâs active participation in the proceedings 
below. In Marquez vs. Secretary of Labor,
[22]
 the Court said:



âx x x. The active participation of the party against whom the 
action was brought, coupled with his failure to object to the 
jurisdiction of the court or quasi-judicial body where the action is 
pending, is tantamount to an invocation of that jurisdiction and a 
willingness to abide by the resolution of the case and will bar said 
party from later on impugning the court or bodyâs jurisdiction.â
  




In the assailed Resolution,
[23]
 respondent NLRC cited 
La Naval Drug Corporation vs. Court of Appeals
[24]
 in holding that private respondent is not in estoppel. Thus,



âThe operation of the principle of estoppel on the question of 
jurisdiction seemingly depends upon whether the lower court actually had
 jurisdiction or not. If it had 
no jurisdiction
, but 
the case was tried and decided upon the theory that it had jurisdiction,
 the parties are not barred, on appeal, from assailing such 
jurisdiction, for the same âmust exist as a matter of law, and may not 
be conferred by consent of the parties or by estoppelâ (5 C.J.S., 
861-863). 
However, if the lower court 
had jurisdiction
,
 and the case was heard and decided upon a given theory, such, for 
instance, as that the court had no jurisdiction, the party who induced 
it to adopt such theory will not be permitted, on appeal, to assume an 
inconsistent position â that the lower court had jurisdiction. 
Here, the principle of estoppel applies
.
 The rule that jurisdiction is conferred by law, and does not depend 
upon the will of the parties, has no bearing thereon.â (Underscoring 
ours) 




Again, the respondent NLRC has erroneously interpreted our ruling in the 
La Naval

 case. Under the said ruling, estoppel lies in this case. Private 
respondent is estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the Labor 
Arbiter before the respondent NLRC having actively participated in the 
proceedings before the former. At no time before or during the trial on 
the merits did private respondent assail the jurisdiction of the Labor 
Arbiter. Private respondent took the cue only from the preliminary 
statement in the decision of the Labor Arbiter, which was a mere obiter,
 and raised the issue of jurisdiction before the Commission. It was then
 too late. Estoppel had set in.

Turning now to the merits of the case, We uphold the ruling of the Labor Arbiter that petitioner was illegally dismissed.

The requisites of a valid dismissal are (1) the dismissal must be
 for any of the causes expressed in Article 282 of the Labor Code,
[25]
 and (2) the employee must be given an opportunity to be heard and to defend himself.
[26]

 The substantive and procedural laws must be strictly complied with 
before a worker can be dismissed from his employment because what is at 
stake is not only the employeeâs position but his livelihood.
[27]


Petitionerâs dismissal was grounded on culpable carelessness, 
negligence and failure to follow specific instruction(s) or established 
procedure(s) under OSDA 1.11; and, having forged or falsified official 
document(s) under OSDA 2.01.

Private respondent blames petitioner for failure to follow 
established procedure in the hotel on a guestâs request for long 
distance calls. Petitioner, however, explained that the usual or 
established procedures are not followed by the operators and hotel 
employees when circumstances warrant. For instance, the RLDC forms and 
the deposits are brought by the page boy directly to the operators 
instead of the cashiers if the latter are busy and cannot attend to the 
same. Furthermore, she avers that the telephone operators are not 
conscious of the serial numbers in the RLDCs and at times, the used 
RLDCs are recycled. Even the page boys do not actually check the serial 
numbers of all RLDCs in one batch, except for the first and the last.

On the charge of taking of the money by petitioner, it is to be 
noted that the second P500.00 deposit made by the Japanese guest Ieda 
was later discovered to be inserted in the folder for cancelled calls 
with deposit and official receipts. Thus, there exists no basis for 
personal appropriation by the petitioner of the money involved. Another 
reason is the alleged tampering of RLDC No. 862406.
[28]

 While petitioner and her co-operator Loleng admitted that they indeed 
altered the date appearing therein from February 15, 1990 to February 
13, the same was purposely made to reflect the true date of the 
transaction without any malice whatsoever on their part.

As pointed out by Labor Arbiter Oswald B. Lorenzo, thus:



âThe specifics of the grounds relied by respondent hotelâs 
dismissal of complainant are those stated in Annex âFâ of the latterâs 
POSITION PAPER, which is the Notice of Dismissal, notably: 


OSDA 2.01 - Forging, falsifying official document(s) 
OSDA 1.11 - Culpable negligence or failure to follow specific instruction(s) or established procedure(s) 


On this score, we are persuaded by the complainantâs arguments that 
under OSDA 1.11, infractions of this sort is not without qualifications,
 which is, that the alleged culpable carelessness, negligence or failure
 to follow instruction(s) or established procedure(s), RESULTING IN LOSS
 OR DAMAGE TO COMPANY PROPERTY. From the facts obtaining in this case, 
there is no quantum of proof whatsoever, except the general allegations 
in respondentâs POSITION PAPER and other pleadings that loss or damage 
to company property resulted from the charged infraction. To our mind, 
this is where labor tribunals should come in and help correct 
interpretation of company policies which in the enforcement thereof 
wreaks havoc to the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure. 
Apparently, the exercise of little flexibility by complainant and 
co-employees which is predicated on good faith should not be taken 
against them and more particularly against the complainant herein. In 
this case, to sustain the generalized charge of respondent hotel under 
OSDA 1.11 would unduly be sanctioning the imposition of too harsh a 
penalty - which is dismissal.

In the same tenor, the respondentâs charge under OSDA 1.11 on the
 alleged falsification of private document is also with a qualification,
 in that the alleged act of falsification must have been done âIN SUCH A
 WAY AS TO MISLEAD THE USER(S) THEREOF.â Again, based on the facts of 
the complained act, there appeared no one to have been misled on the 
change of date from RLDC #862406 FROM 15 TO 13 February 1990.

As a matter of fact, we are in agreement with the jurisprudence 
cited by VIRGILIO M. PATAG, the 2nd Asst. City Prosecutor of the City of
 Manila, who exculpated complainant MANEJA from the charges of 
falsification of private documents and qualified theft under IS No. 
90-11083 and marked Annex âHâ of complainantâs POSITION PAPER, when he 
ruled that an altercation which makes the document speak the truth 
cannot be the foundation of a criminal action. As to the charge of 
qualified theft, we too are of the finding, like the city prosecutor 
above-mentioned that there was no evidence on the part of MANEJA to have
 unlawfully taken the P500.00 either from the hotel or from guest IEDA 
on 13 February 1990 and moreover, we too, find no evidence that 
complainant MANEJA had the intention to profit thereby nor had 
misappropriated the P500.00 in question.â
[29]




Given the factual circumstances of the case, we cannot deduce 
dishonesty from the act and omission of petitioner. Our norms of social 
justice demand that we credit employees with the presumption of good 
faith in the performance of their duties,
[30]

 especially petitioner who has served private respondent since 1985 up 
to 1990 without any tinge of dishonesty and was even named âModel 
Employeeâ for the month of April, 1989.
[31]


Petitioner has been charged with a very serious offense - 
dishonesty. This can irreparably wreck her life as an employee for no 
employer will take to its bosom a dishonest employee. Dismissal is the 
supreme penalty that can be meted to an employee and its imposition 
cannot be justified where the evidence is ambivalent.
[32]

 It must, therefore, be based on a clear and not on an ambiguous or 
ambivalent ground. Any ambiguity or ambivalence on the ground relied 
upon by an employer in terminating the services of an employee denies 
the latter his 
full
 right to contest its legality. Fairness cannot countenance such ambiguity or ambivalence.
[33]


An employer can terminate the services of an employee only for 
valid and just causes which must be supported by clear and convincing 
evidence. The employer has the burden of proving that the dismissal was 
indeed for a valid and just cause.
[34]
 Failure to do so results in a finding that the dismissal was unjustified.
[35]


Finding that there was no just cause for dismissal of petitioner,
 we now determine if the rudiments of due process have been duly 
accorded to her.

Well-settled is the dictum that the twin requirements of notice 
and hearing constitute the essential elements of due process in the 
dismissal of employees. It is a cardinal rule in our jurisdiction that 
the employer must furnish the employee with two written notices before 
the termination of employment can be effected: (a) the first apprises 
the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which his dismissal
 is sought; and, (b) the second informs the employee of the employerâs 
decision to dismiss him. The requirement of a hearing, on the other 
hand, is complied with as long as there was an 
opportunity
 to be heard, and not necessarily that an actual hearing was conducted.
[36]


In the case at bar, petitioner and her co-operator Loleng were 
issued a memorandum on March 7, 1990. On March 11, 1990, they submitted 
their written explanation thereto. On March 20, 1990, a written report 
was made with a recommendation that the offenses committed by them were 
covered by OSDA 1.11 and 2.01. Thereafter, on March 23, 1990, petitioner
 was served with a notice of dismissal for said violations effective 
April 1, 1990.

An examination of the record reveals that no hearing was ever 
conducted by private respondent before petitioner was dismissed. While 
it may be true that petitioner submitted a written explanation, no 
hearing was actually conducted before her employment was terminated. She
 was not accorded the opportunity to fully defend herself.

Consultations or conferences may not be a substitute for the 
actual holding of a hearing. Every opportunity and assistance must be 
accorded to the employee by the management to enable him to prepare 
adequately for his defense, including legal representation.
[37]

 Considering that petitioner denied having allegedly taken the second 
P500.00 deposit of the Japanese guest which was eventually found; and, 
having made the alteration of the date on the second RLDC merely to 
reflect the true date of the transaction, these circumstances should 
have at least warranted a separate hearing to enable petitioner to fully
 ventilate her side. Absent such hearing, petitionerâs right to due 
process was clearly violated.
[38]


It bears stressing that a workerâs employment is property in the 
constitutional sense. He cannot be deprived of his work without due 
process of law. 
Substantive due process
 mandates that an employee can only be dismissed based on just or authorized causes. 
Procedural due process

 requires further that he can only be dismissed after he has been given 
an opportunity to be heard. The import of due process necessitates the 
compliance of these two aspects.

Accordingly, we hold that the labor arbiter did not err in 
awarding full backwages in view of his finding that petitioner was 
dismissed without just cause and without due process.

We ruled in the case of 
Bustamante vs. NLRC
[39]

 that the amount of backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed 
employee must be computed from the time he was dismissed to the time he 
is actually reinstated, without deducting the earnings he derived 
elsewhere pending the resolution of the case.

Petitioner is likewise entitled to the thirteenth-month pay. 
Presidential Decree No. 851, as amended by Memorandum Order No. 28, 
provides that employees are entitled to the thirteenth-month pay benefit
 regardless of their designation and irrespective of the method by which
 their wages are paid.
[40]


The award of moral and exemplary damages to petitioner is also 
warranted where there is lack of due process in effecting the dismissal.

Where the termination of the services of an employee is attended 
by fraud or bad faith on the part of the employer, as when the latter 
knowingly made false allegations of a supposed valid cause when none 
existed, moral and exemplary damages may be awarded in favor of the 
former.
[41]


The anti-social and oppressive abuse of its right to investigate 
and dismiss its employees constitute a violation of Article 1701 of the 
New Civil Code which prohibits acts of oppression by either capital or 
labor against the other, and Article 21 on human relations. The grant of
 moral damages to the employees by reason of such conduct on the part of
 the company is sanctioned by Article 2219, No. 10 of the Civil Code, 
which allows recovery of such damages in actions referred to in Article 
21.
[42]


The award of attorneyâs fees amounting to ten percent (10%) of 
the total award by the labor arbiter is justified under Article 111 of 
the Labor Code.

WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the petition is 
GRANTED and the assailed resolutions of the respondent National Labor 
Relations Commission dated June 3, 1994 and October 20, 1995 are hereby 
REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The decision dated May 29, 1992 of the Labor 
Arbiter is therefore REINSTATED.
