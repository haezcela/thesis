BELLOSILLO, J.:


In a conflict of rights over registered land subject of intestate 
proceedings which is sold without express authority of the court, which 
right should prevail: those of the innocent purchasers for value in good
 faith, or those of the heirs of the estate?  
  
 This petition emanates from a case for 
Annulment of Fraudulent Sales of Registered Property with Reconveyance and for Damages

 filed in 1968 with the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial 
Court), Naga City, by Juana Vda. de Arejola, Justiniano R. Exequiel and 
Dominador Aureas, as administrators of the Intestate Estate of Luis P. 
Arejola, against Atty. Jacobo Briones and his spouse Natividad Olivan, 
and the spouses Benito Gavino and Juana Euste.
[1]


In 1976 the original records of the case were burned in a fire 
which gutted the old Provincial Capitol Building housing Branch 22 of 
the court.
[2]
 The records were
 eventually reconstituted although partially. Five (5) judges 
successively presided over the case: Judges Delfin Vir. Sunga, Jorge S. 
Imperial, Juan B. Montecillo, Ignacio S. Calleja, Jr., and Angel S. 
Malaya. Several substitutions of counsel also took place. In 1977 
plaintiff Juana Vda. de Arejola died. Defendants Jacobo Briones and the 
Gavino spouses also died some years later.


Culled from the reconstituted records, in 1953 a parcel of land 
measuring 9.3540 hectares covered by TCT No. 896 of the Registry of 
Deeds of Camarines Sur and originally registered in the name of the 
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC)
[3]
 was sold by the corporation on installment basis to Luis P. Arejola under a 
Deed of Conditional Sale
. The vendee however died on 25 September 1958 without completing his payments.
[4]


Subsequently, a petition for settlement of his intestate estate was
 commenced by his surviving spouse Juana Vda. de Arejola who on 11 
October 1958 was appointed special administratrix and on 2 February 1959
 as regular administratrix in Sp. Proc. No. R-9 (771). Atty. Jacobo 
Briones was engaged as lawyer of the estate.
[5]

 However, the lot purchased from the RFC was not included in the 
inventory of properties submitted by Juana to the intestate court, 
although she reserved the right to include in the list all other 
properties belonging to her husband's estate that would come later to 
her knowledge.
[6]


In April 1960, after being informed that the land bought by her 
deceased husband from the RFC was about to be foreclosed for non-payment
 of amortizations, Juana made arrangements with the Development Bank of 
the Philippines (DBP), successor in interest of RFC, to save the 
property. After proper negotiations, she executed with the bank a 
"Revival and Re-amortization of Deed of Conditional Sale"

 and signed the document in her own behalf as vendee and as 
administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband. This transaction 
in effect revived the conditional sale
  entered into by the RFC with her husband Luis
[7]
 with the imprimatur of the intestate court.
[8]
 


On 3 September 1962 Juana was granted judicial authority to sell 
properties of the decedent's estate. However, with her removal as 
administratrix on 3 October 1962, this authority became 
functus oficio
.


On 14 February 1963, armed with the authority to sell earlier 
granted to her by the court, without revealing however that her 
appointment as adminstratrix had already been revoked, Juana sold to the
 Gavino spouses the subject property by way of 
pacto de retro
 for P6,650.00.
[9]
 


Meanwhile, upon full payment to DBP of the purchase price, a final 
Deed of Sale

 was executed on 15 February 1963 between Juana and DBP which resulted 
in the cancellation of TCT No. 896 and the issuance of TCT No. 4873 in 
the name of Juana Vda. de Arejola.
[10]

 On 6 March 1963, despite her earlier sale of the land to the Gavino 
spouses, Juana fictitiously sold the same property to the estate's 
lawyer, Atty. Jacobo Briones, so that the latter could secure a mortgage
 thereon in her behalf.
[11]
 At
 any rate, the sale to Atty. Briones was registered; accordingly, TCT 
No. 4873 was cancelled and TCT No. 4874 was issued in the name of Atty. 
Jacobo Briones.
[12]
 


On 22 April 1963 Juana Vda. de Arejola asked for and was given by 
the Gavino spouses an additional amount of P1,000.00 and a new deed of 
pacto de retro

 with option to buy was executed thus formalizing the earlier sale to 
the spouses and indicating therein the actual purchase price of 
P7,650.00. However, the certificate of title described in the contract 
of sale was still TCT No. 896
[13]

 despite the fact that it had already been cancelled and substituted by 
TCT No. 4873 in the name of Juana, and then by TCT No. 4874 in favor of 
Atty. Jacobo Briones.    


On 18 July 1963 Atty. Briones mortgaged the property to PNB for P4,000.00,
[14]
 and a month later, the amount was increased by P700.00.
[15]
 


On 15 October 1963 Atty. Briones sold the property to the Gavino 
spouses. The latter alleged that they were constrained to buy the land 
because of their apprehension that they might lose their earlier 
investment of P7,650.00 on the same land under the sale by Juana in 
their favor on 22 April 1963. As a consequence, TCT No. 4874 was 
cancelled and TCT No. 5244 was issued in the name of Benito Gavino 
married to Juana Euste.
[16]
 


On 12 January 1968 Juana Vda. de Arejola together with the other 
judicial administrators of the estate of Luis P. Arejola, namely, 
Justiniano Exequiel and Dominador Aureas, manifesting that all of the 
foregoing sales executed by Juana were done without judicial authority 
to sell through the manipulations of Atty. Briones who acted for his own
 benefit, filed the instant case against him, his wife and the Gavino 
spouses.     


On 31 March 1969, during the pendency of the case, one Sulpicio 
Lovendino filed a complaint-in-intervention alleging that on 25 February
 1969 the property was sold to him by the Gavino spouses for P15,000.00 
and that by virtue thereof TCT No. 5244 was cancelled and TCT No. 10503 
was issued in his name.
[17]
 


After Lovendino died his heirs manifested that they were not 
interested in substituting him because the lot had already been sold to a
 certain Gerardo Pesebre in 1971.
[18]

 Be that as it may, it is undisputed that the property is now in the 
hands of Amparo Gavino Pesebre and Belen Gavino Verceluz, daughters of 
the spouses Benito Gavino and Juana Euste.     


On the basis of the antecedent facts a decision was rendered by the
 trial court on 29 August 1991 declaring the sales of the land to 
defendant spouses Benito Gavino and Juana Euste valid and lawful. It 
ordered that in the final distribution of the intestate estate of Luis 
P. Arejola the subject property be excluded from the estate chargeable 
however against Juana Vda. de Arejola's share, interest and 
participation therein, and that the Gavino spouses be granted attorney's
 fees of P5,000.00.
[19]
 


The plaintiffs (now private respondents) appealed to the Court of 
Appeals asserting in the main that the sale of the property by Juana 
Vda. de Arejola and Atty. Jacobo Briones to the Gavino spouses was 
invalid and unlawful so that the property must be included in the final 
distribution of the intestate estate of Luis P. Arejola.
[20]
 


Respondent appellate court upheld the validity of the sale to the 
Gavinos but only insofar as the individual share of Juana Vda. de 
Arejola was concerned.
[21]
 
Consequently, the two (2) daughters of Benito Gavino, namely, Amparo G. 
Pesebre and Belen G. Verceluz, then already the registered owners of the
 property, were ordered to convey the remaining undivided portion 
thereof to the estate of Luis P. Arejola, retaining in their name only 
the undivided portion equivalent to the share of his widow Juana. It 
also directed the estate of Luis P. Arejola to refund to the Gavino 
spouses a proportionate share of the amount of P7,650.00 which they paid
 to Juana for the land. The appellate court denied the claim for damages
 and deleted the award of attorney's fees. 


Petitioners now pray for the adjudication of the entire lot to 
them, Juana Vda. de Arejola being the sole owner of the property as 
evidenced by the transfer certificates of title shown to them and, 
consequently, had full authority to sell or otherwise dispose of it. 
They also ask that since they simply relied on the information contained
 in the certificates of title they should be declared innocent 
purchasers for value and in good faith.
[22]
 


Respondents, on the other hand, claim that the entire lot should be
 considered part of the estate of Luis P. Arejola because the sale by 
Juana Vda. de Arejola to the Gavinos was invalid considering that the 
property was in 
custodia legis
 and could not be disposed of 
without the imprimatur of the intestate court. They suggest that Juana 
was a victim of the malicious machinations of the estate's counsel, 
Atty. Jacobo Briones.
[23]
 


We do not agree with the finding of the Court of Appeals nor of the
 Regional Trial Court that the contested parcel of land belonged 
entirely to Luis P. Arejola, 
ergo
, formed part of his estate. In the proceedings before the trial court, plaintiffs presented the 
Deed of Conditional Sale
 executed by the RFC describing vendee Luis P. Arejola as 
married to Juana Arejola
,
 ineluctably showing that he acquired his right over the land during his
 marriage to Juana. This being the case, the land is presumed to be 
conjugal, hence, Art. 160
[24]
 of the New Civil Code will have to be applied, i.e., 
all
 property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal 
partnership unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the 
husband or to the wife
. Although this presumption is rebuttable, it
 can only be overcome by strong, clear and convincing evidence of 
exclusive ownership of one of the spouses. In the case at bar, the 
quantum of proof demanded by law has not been satisfied. For nowhere in 
the exhibits presented by both parties, documentary or testimonial, has 
it been demonstrated that the land in question was inherited by Luis nor
 acquired by him with his own capital or exclusive funds. The 
presumption not having been overthrown, the conclusion is that the 
contested land is conjugal property. 


It is this conjugal nature of the property that vested in Juana 
Vda. de Arejola, as surviving co-owner, the right to agree to a revival 
of the conditional sale. This should explain 
why
 the 
Deed of Revival and Re-amortization of Conditional Sale

 was signed by her not only as administratrix of her husband's estate 
but also in her own behalf. There should be no doubt that the property 
in question is not entirely owned by the estate of Luis for what 
rightfully belongs to it is only one-half, the other half being Juana's 
share as conjugal partner. It must be recalled that when Juana and the 
DBP (formerly RFC) agreed on reviving the conditional sale, Juana was 
still the administratrix of the intestate estate. Thus, where an 
executor or administrator receives by virtue of his representative 
capacity property to which the decedent became entitled after his death,
 he holds such property as asset of the estate and is liable therefor in
 his representative capacity.
[25]
 He cannot acquire by purchase, even by public auction, the property of the estate under his administration.
[26]
 
Consequently,
 with regard to the portionof land held by Juana for the estate of her 
late husband in her capacity as administratrix, she had no right to 
acquire ownership over it and have the entire lot titled in her name 
alone
. 


After the DBP had been fully paid the purchase price of the 
property Juana Vda. de Arejola ceased to be the administratrix of the 
estate. As a result, if that portion of the land pertaining to the share
 of Luis in the conjugal partnership had been held by Juana beyond the 
period of her judicial administration she only did so in trust for the 
estate.
[27]
 But this trust was
 breached when after the land had been fully paid for, Juana 
deliberately caused the issuance of a new certificate of title in her 
name as 
sole
 owner thereby depriving the estate of Luis P. Arejola of its rightful share therein. 


Private respondents insist that the sale of the land by Juana Vda. 
de Arejola to the Gavino spouses was illegal and invalid because her 
lawyer, Atty. Jacobo Briones, manipulated her into selling the property.
 This is difficult to accept. The evidence on record shows that while 
Juana may have been improperly and improvidently advised by her lawyer 
on the matter, the ultimate decision was still hers. It was with full 
knowledge and consent that she entered into the sale transaction with 
the Gavinos. 


The claim of respondents that the invalidity of the sale is 
aggravated by the absence of judicial imprimatur cannot be sustained. If
 the sale was without judicial approval, it could only be attributable 
to Juana's own fault because she knew very well that she was no longer 
administratrix of the estate and therefore could not be empowered by the
 intestate court to sell the property. And yet, despite this knowledge, 
she proceeded with the sale. Justice and reason therefore dictate that 
she, not the Gavinos, should suffer the consequences of her foolhardy 
act. 
Apropos
 to this, we quote the findings of the Regional Trial Court
[28]
- 




x x x x the vendee Gavino acted in good faith when he purchased 
the subject property from one who Gavino knows to be an heir and 
entitled to a share of the land under administration, of course subject 
to the final distribution of the estate x x x x




and the findings of the Court of Appeals
[29]
- 




x x x x When they purchased the same from Juana R. vda. de 
Arejola, they were made to believe that she had court authority to sell.
 They cannot be faulted for not knowing that the said authority had 
already lapsed. When they purchased the same property from Atty. Jocobo 
Briones, to protect their investment as aforesaid, they relied on the 
certificate of title in his name. Hence, it cannot be said that they 
were purchasers in bad faith. 




The above factual findings of the courts below that the Gavinos 
were innocent purchasers for value cannot be disturbed. It is axiomatic 
that findings of fact of the trial court are entitled to great respect 
and carry more weight when affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
[30]
 


Insofar as the contract of sale executed by Atty. Briones in favor 
of the Gavinos is concerned, the Court of Appeals also ruled that the 
vendee spouses could not be considered in bad faith for they simply 
relied on the vendor's Torrens title. In so concluding, the appellate 
court considered three (3) varying situational accounts: 


First
, the Gavinos claimed that they employed adequate 
safeguards in verifying the real owner of the land by checking with the 
PNB and the Register of Deeds. Benito Gavino recounted that Juana Vda. 
de Arejola always came up with what appeared to him to be an alibi why 
she could not turn over to him the documents covering the land in 
litigation.
[31]
 In the first 
week of August 1963 Atty. Briones went to their house and asked them if 
it was true that they bought the land from Juana by way of 
pacto de retro
.
 When they confirmed that they did, Atty. Briones told them that he was 
already the owner and, if they wanted, they could check with PNB and the
 Register of Deeds to ascertain who the real owner was.
[32]
 


Upon verification with PNB, the Gavinos learned that the property 
was mortgaged with the bank to secure a loan of P4,700.00 in the name of
 the registered owner, Atty. Jacobo Briones. The spouses also learned 
from the Register of Deeds that the land was indeed registered in the 
name of Atty. Briones. Benito Gavino then approached Juana Vda. de 
Arejola and asked her why the property that was already sold to them by 
way of 
pacto de retro
 was also sold to Atty. Briones, but the 
latter simply assured him that she would take care of the matter 
including the P7,650.00 which the Gavinos gave her in consideration of 
the sale.
[33]
 


In October of 1963 Atty. Briones approached the Gavinos and told 
them that he wanted to sell the land. Petitioner Gavino went to his 
lawyer, a certain Atty. Catimbang, and explained the matter to him. 
Atty. Catimbang told him that the papers appeared to be in order so 
petitioners could buy the property if they had the money. Upon this 
advice, the Gavinos bought the property. The parties agreed on the 
purchase price of P14,350.00 with Gavino imposing the condition that the
 mortgage indebtedness of P4,700.00 be deducted from the consideration.
[34]
 


Second
, Atty. Briones alleged that Atty. Catimbang, then 
representing the Gavinos, informed him that the property mortgaged by 
him with the PNB was also sold to the Gavinos.
[35]

 Thereafter, Atty. Briones went to see Juana Vda. de Arejola and 
recommended to her that to avoid an estafa suit the sale should be 
consolidated in the name of the Gavinos provided the latter assumed the 
mortgage indebtedness, to which the widow agreed. For purposes of 
convenience, Atty. Briones was designated as vendor instead of Juana 
because at this point the latter no longer had the personality to sell.
[36]
 


Third
, Juana Vda. de Arejola claimed that she was a victim
 of the manipulative designs of Atty. Briones and the Gavino spouses. 
But her acts and omissions adequately supported by evidence demonstrate 
that she had a hand in the transactions that transpired. It seems 
reasonable therefore to infer that the sale by Juana to Atty. Briones 
was only simulated in order for the latter to mortgage the same with the
 PNB for Juana's own benefit after she had sold the property by 
pacto de retro
 to the Gavinos.    


We are convinced, more than ever, that all the problems over the 
land were caused by Atty. Jacobo Briones and the widow, Juana Vda. de 
Arejola, whom Atty. Briones described as "always strapped for cash and 
living beyond her means."
[37]
 As admitted by him in his testimony, this was not the first time that he entered into shady deals 
with and for
 the widow.
[38]
 


In determining whether the Gavinos were purchasers in good faith, we call to mind the edict in 
Fule v. de Legare
[39]
-    




A purchaser in good faith is one who buys property of another, 
without notice that some other person has a right to or interest in, 
such
property and pays a full and fair price of the same at the time of such 
purchase, or before he has notice of the claim or interest of some other
 persons in the property. 
Good faith consists in an honest intention to abstain from taking any unconscientious advantage of another 
(italics supplied).




When the Gavinos learned that after all Atty. Briones' predecessor 
in interest was Juana Vda. de Arejola, a person known to be an heir of 
her late husband Luis P. Arejola and a logical transferee of the 
property, the Gavinos could not have sensed any foul play. In fact, 
despite such knowledge, they checked with Juana herself who confirmed 
having sold the land to Atty. Briones. The transfer certificate of title
 covering the land was in the name of Atty. Briones. The tax 
declarations were in the name of Juana Vda. de Arejola and, later, in 
the name of Atty. Jacobo Briones.
[40]

 The records with PNB and the Register of Deeds, as already adverted to,
 confirmed that Atty. Briones was the registered owner of the land. The 
Gavinos also sought the advice of Atty. Catimbang who found all the 
papers to be in order and consequently advised them to buy the land.


Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the Gavinos did not
 exert efforts to ascertain the legality and fairness of the transaction
 they entered into. According to the Court of Appeals, citing 
Macquiling v. Umadhay
,
[41]
 




x x x 'she took all the necessary precautions to ascertain the 
true ownership of the property having engaged the services of a lawyer 
for the specific purpose, and it was only after said counsel had assured
 her that everything was in order did she make the final arrangements to
 purchase the property.' The appellate court's conclusion that 
respondent x x x was a purchaser in good faith and for value is correct,
 and the title she has thereby acquired is good and indefeasible.




Resolving now the core issue, we hold that the rights of innocent 
purchasers for value should prevail. Even assuming that the sale by 
Atty. Briones to the Gavinos was void - being based on a fictitious 
transfer from Juana to Atty. Briones - as the former did not own the 
property in its entirety when sold, 
the general rule that the direct result of a previous void contract cannot be valid
,
 is inapplicable in this case as it will directly contravene the Torrens
 system of registration. Where innocent third persons, relying on the 
correctness of the certificate of title thus issued, acquire rights over
 the property, the court cannot disregard such rights and order the 
cancellation of the certificate.
[42]

 The effect of such outright cancellation will be to impair public 
confidence in the certificate of title. The sanctity of the Torrens 
system must be preserved; otherwise, everyone dealing with the property 
registered under the system will have to inquire in every instance as to
 whether the title had been regularly or irregularly issued, contrary to
 the evident purpose of the law. Every person dealing with the 
registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of
 title issued therefor and the law will in no way oblige him to go 
behind the certificate to determine the condition of the property.
[43]
 


The Court can do no less. The philosophy of the Torrens system must
 be upheld. The present registered owners of the land cannot be 
disturbed in their ownership and possession thereof and be ordered to 
return the property for inclusion in the final settlement of the 
intestate estate of Luis P. Arejola. It is for this reason that we 
cannot entirely affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. This is not
 to say however that Juana Vda. de Arejola is not liable to the estate 
for willfully causing the transfer to her of the sole ownership of the 
entire land including that pertaining to the share of her husband in 
their conjugal partnership of gains.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is GRANTED and the 
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals awarding to petitioners only a
 portion of the disputed property as well as its Resolution denying 
reconsideration thereof is SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Decision of the 
Regional Trial Court of Naga City awarding the entire property of 9.3540
 hectares originally covered by TCT No. 896 to the petitioners; 
declaring valid, lawful and binding the sale of subject parcel of land 
to the late Luis P. Arejola and Juana Vda. de Arejola and later to 
petitioner Benito Gavino married to Juana Euste; ordering the exclusion 
thereof in the final distribution of the estate of Luis P. Arejola in 
Sp. Proc. No. R-9 (771) but chargeable against respondent Juana Vda. de 
Arejola's share, interest and participation in the estate; and, granting
 to petitioners P5,000.00 as attorney's fees, is REINSTATED and 
AFFIRMED. No costs.
