SAMAHAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA FILSYSTEMS (SAMAFIL-NAFLU-KMU), PETITIONER, VS. HON. SECRETARY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT AND FILSYSTEMS, INC., RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


Assailed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court are the Resolution and Order
[1]

 of the public respondent, dated June 28, 1996 and November 18, 1996, 
respectively, dismissing petitioner's petition for certification 
election.

It appears that petitioner Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa Filsystems (SAMAFIL-NAFLU-KMU) is a 
registered labor union

 with Certificate of Registration No. NCR-UR-10-1575-95 issued by the 
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on October 25, 1995. On 
November 6, 1995, petitioner union filed a Petition for Certification 
Election among the rank-and-file employees of private respondent 
FILSYSTEMS, Inc. before the DOLE - National Capital Region (NCR).
[2]

 Attached as annexes to the petition are the Certificate of Registration
 issued by the DOLE, copies of union membership signed by thirty three 
(33) rank-and-file employees of respondent company, the Charter 
Certificate showing its affiliation with the National Federation of 
Labor Unions (NAFLU-KMU), the list of union officers, the certification 
of the union secretary of the minutes of the general membership meeting,
 the Books of Accounts and its Constitution and By-Laws.
[3]


Private respondent opposed the petition. It questioned the status
 of petitioner as a legitimate labor organization on the ground of lack 
of proof that its contract of affiliation with the NAFLU-KMU has been 
submitted to the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR) within thirty (30) days
 from its execution.
[4]


In reply, petitioner averred that as a duly registered labor 
union, it has "all the rights and privileges x x x to act as 
representative of its members for the purpose of collective bargaining 
with employers."
[5]


On January 12, 1996, Med-Arbiter Paterno D. Adap dismissed the 
petition for certification election. He ruled that petitioner, as an 
affiliate of NAFLU-KMU, has no legal personality on account of its 
failure to comply with paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) of Section 3, Rule II
 of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code,
[6]
 viz:



"x x x 


"In matters of affiliation of an independently registered union, 
the rules provide that the latter shall be considered an affiliate of a 
labor federation after submission of the contract or agreement of 
affiliation to the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR) within thirty (30) 
days after its execution. 


"Likewise, it mandates the federation or national union concerned 
to issue a charter certificate indicating the creation or establishment 
of a local or chapter, copy of which shall be submitted to the Bureau of
 Labor Relations within thirty (30) days from issuance of such 
certificate. 


"A close examination of the records of the case does not reveal 
that the federation and the independent union have executed a contract 
or agreement of affiliation, nor had it shown that it has submitted its 
charter certificate to the Bureau of Labor Relations, within thirty (30)
 days from issuance of such charter certificate as amended by the rules.
 


"Petitioner argued that it has complied with all the requirements 
for certification election pursuant to the mandate of Sec. 2, Rule V of 
Book V of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code; that the rule cited 
by respondent is not included in the Rule citing the requirements for 
certification election. 


"We disagree with petitioner's contention. The rule cited by the 
petitioner, Sec. 2, Rule V, Book V, sub-paragraphs A, B, C, D, E, F and 
G, refers to an independently registered labor organization which has 
filed a petition for certification election. 


"In the case at bar, an independently registered union has 
affiliated with a federation, hence, strict compliance with the 
requirements embodied in Sec. 3, paragraphs A, B and E of Rule II, Book V
 of the Rules and Regulations implementing the Labor Code should be 
complied with. 


"Record discloses that petitioner has not shown to have executed a 
contract or agreement of affiliation nor has it established that is has 
submitted its charter certificate to the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR)
 within thirty (30) days from its execution. 


"Thus, petitioner in this case having failed to comply with the 
mandatory requirement, there was no valid affiliation. Consequently, 
petitioner has no legal personality because the union failed to attain 
the status of legitimacy for failure to comply with the requirements of 
law." 
  




Petitioner appealed to the Office of the Secretary of Labor and 
Employment. It reiterated its contention that as an independently 
registered union, it has the right to file a petition for certification 
election regardless of its failure to prove its affiliation with 
NAFLU-KMU.
[7]


On February 26, 1996, private respondent opposed the appeal. It 
argued that petitioner should have filed its petition for certification 
election as an independently registered union and not as a union 
affiliated with NAFLU-KMU.
[8]


Meanwhile or on February 7, 1996, another union, the Filsystem 
Workers Union (FWU), filed a Petition for Certification Election in the 
same bargaining unit. On March 22, 1996, the Med-Arbitration - NCR 
Branch granted the petition. The certification election held on April 
19, 1996, was won by FWU which garnered twenty six (26) votes out of the
 forty six (46) eligible voters. The FWU was certified on April 29, 
1996, as the exclusive bargaining agent of all rank-and-file employees 
of private respondent. Eventually, FWU and the private respondent 
negotiated a CBA.
[9]


On June 11, 1996, the private respondent filed a Motion to 
Dismiss Appeal of petitioner as it has become moot and academic. It also
 invoked Section 3, Rule V of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the 
Labor Code stating that "once a union has been certified, no 
certification election may be held within one (1) year from the date of 
issuance of a final certification election [result]."
[10]


In opposing the Motion to Dismiss Appeal, petitioner contended 
that its appeal is not moot as the certification election held on April 
19, 1996, was void for violating Section 10, Rule V of the Implementing 
Rules of Book V of the Labor Code,
[11]
 
viz
: 



"SEC. 10. 
Decision of the Secretary final and inappealable
.
 - The Secretary shall have fifteen (15) calendar days within which to 
decide the appeal from receipt of the records of the case. The filing of
 the appeal from the decision of the Med-Arbiter stays the holding of 
any certification election. The decision of the Secretary shall be final
 and inappealable."
  




Petitioner further argued that the CBA executed between the FWU and 
the private respondent could not affect its pending representation case 
following Section 4, Rule V of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the 
Labor Code
[12]
 which states:



"SEC. 4. 
Effects of early agreements
. - The 
representation case shall not, however, be adversely affected by a 
collective bargaining agreement registered before or during the last 60 
days of the subsisting agreement or during the pendency of the 
representation case."
  




On June 28, 1996, respondent Secretary dismissed the appeal 
interposed by petitioner on the ground that it has been rendered moot by
 the certification of FWU as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of 
the rank-and-file workers of respondent company. Petitioner's Motion for
 Reconsideration was denied in an Order dated November 18, 1996.
[13]


Before this Court, petitioner contends:



I
  


Public respondent acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to
 acting without or in excess of jurisdiction in holding that the pending
 appeal in the representation case was rendered moot and academic by a 
subsequently enacted collective bargaining agreement in the company.
  


II
  


Public respondent committed a serious legal error and gravely 
abused its discretion in failing to hold that the legal personality of 
petitioner as a union having been established by its Certificate of 
Registration, the same could not be subjected to collateral attack. 
  




The petition is meritorious.

I

We shall first resolve whether the public respondent committed 
grave abuse of discretion when he effectively affirmed the Resolution 
dated January 12, 1996 of the Med-Arbiter dismissing petitioner's 
petition for certification election for failure to prove its affiliation
 with NAFLU-KMU.

The reasoning of the public respondent and the Med- Arbiter is 
flawed, proceeding as it does from a wrong premise. Firstly, it must be 
underscored that petitioner is an independently registered labor union 
as evidenced by a Certificate of Registration issued by the DOLE. As a 
legitimate labor organization, petitioner's right to file a petition for
 certification election on its own is beyond question.
[14]

 Secondly, the failure of petitioner to prove its affiliation with 
NAFLU-KMU cannot affect its right to file said petition for 
certification election as an independent union. At the most, 
petitioner's failure will result in an ineffective affiliation with 
NAFLU-KMU. Still, however, it can pursue its petition for certification 
election as an independent union. In our rulings, we have stressed that 
despite affiliation, the local union remains the basic unit free to 
serve the common interest of all its members and pursue its own 
interests independently of the federation.
[15]


In fine, the Med-Arbiter erred in dismissing petitioner's 
petition for certification election on account of its non-submission of 
the charter certificate and the contract of affiliation with the 
NAFLU-KMU with the BLR. The public respondent gravely abused his 
discretion in sustaining the Med-Arbiter's Resolution.

II

We shall now resolve the issue of whether the appeal filed by the
 petitioner was rendered moot and academic by the subsequent 
certification election ordered by the Med-Arbiter, won by the FWU and 
which culminated in a CBA with private respondent.

Public respondent's ruling is anchored on his finding that there 
exists no pending representation case since the petition for 
certification election filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the 
Med-Arbiter. According to the public respondent, the legal effect of the
 dismissal of the petition was to leave the playing field open without 
any legal barrier or prohibition to any petitioner; thus, other 
legitimate labor organizations may file an entirely new petition for 
certification election.

We reject public respondent's ruling. The order of the 
Med-Arbiter dismissing petitioner's petition for certification election 
was seasonably appealed. The appeal stopped the holding of any 
certification election. Section 10, Rule V of the Implementing Rules of 
Book V of the Labor Code is crystal clear and hardly needs any 
interpretation.

Accordingly, there was an unresolved representation case at the 
time the CBA was entered between FWU and private respondent. Following 
Section 4, Rule V of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code,
 such CBA cannot and will not prejudice petitioner's pending 
representation case or render the same moot.
[16]
 This rule was applied in the case of 
Associated Labor Unions (ALU-TUCP) v. Trajano
[17]

 where we held that "[t]here should be no obstacle to the right of the 
employees to petition for a certification election at the proper time, 
that is, within sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the life of a
 certified collective bargaining agreement x x x, not even by a 
collective agreement submitted during the pendency of the representation
 case." Likewise, in 
Associated Labor Unions (ALU) v. Ferrer-Calleja
,
[18]
 we held that a prematurely renewed CBA is not a bar to the holding of a certification election. 

Finally, we bewail private respondent's tenacious opposition to 
petitioner's certification election petition. Such a stance is not 
conducive to industrial peace. Time and again, we have emphasized that 
when a petition for certification election is filed by a legitimate 
labor organization, it is good policy for the employer not to have any 
participation or partisan interest in the choice of the bargaining 
representative. While employers may rightfully be notified or informed 
of petitions of such nature, they should not, however, be considered 
parties thereto with an inalienable right to oppose it. An employer that
 involves itself in a certification election lends suspicion to the fact
 that it wants to create a company union. Thus, in 
Consolidated Farms, Inc. II v. Noriel
,
[19]

 we declared that "[o]n a matter that should be the exclusive concern of
 labor, the choice of a collective bargaining representative, the 
employer is definitely an intruder. His participation, to say the least,
 deserves no encouragement. This Court should be the last agency to lend
 support to such an attempt at interference with a purely internal 
affair of labor. x x x [While] it is true that there may be 
circumstances where the interest of the employer calls for its being 
heard on the matter, x x x sound policy dictates that as much as 
possible, management is to maintain a strictly hands-off policy. For if 
it does not, it may lend itself to the legitimate suspicion that it is 
partial to one of the contending unions. That is repugnant to the 
concept of collective bargaining. That is against the letter and spirit 
of welfare legislation intended to protect labor and promote social 
justice. The judiciary then should be the last to look with tolerance at
 such efforts of an employer to take part in the process leading to the 
free and untrammeled choice of the exclusive bargaining representative 
of the workers."

IN VIEW WHEREOF
, the instant petition is 
GRANTED. The assailed Resolution and Order of the public respondent are 
set aside. The Bureau of Labor Relations is ORDERED to hold a 
certification election in respondent company with petitioner as a 
contending union. No costs.
