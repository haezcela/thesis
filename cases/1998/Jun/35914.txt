ASSOCIATED BANK, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND LORENZO SARMIENTO JR., RESPONDENTS.

PANGANIBAN, J.:


In a merger, does the surviving corporation have a right to enforce
 a contract entered into by the absorbed company subsequent to the date 
of the merger agreement, but prior to the issuance of a certificate of 
merger by the Securities and Exchange Commission?      
  
The Case
 


This is a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to set aside the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]

 in CA-GR CV No. 26465 promulgated on January 30, 1996, which answered 
the above question in the negative. The challenged Decision reversed and
 set aside the October 17, 1986 Decision
[3]

 in Civil Case No. 85-32243, promulgated by the Regional Trial Court of 
Manila, Branch 48, which disposed of the controversy in favor of herein 
petitioner as follows:
[4]
 




âWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff
 Associated Bank. The defendant Lorenzo Sarmiento, Jr. is ordered to pay
 plaintiff: 


        The amount of P4,689,413.63 with interest thereon at 14% per annum until fully paid;      
        The amount of P200,000.00 as and for attorneyâs fees; and 
        The costs of suit.â 




On the other hand, the Court of Appeals resolved the case in this wise:
[5]
 




âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision appealed from, 
dated October 17, 1986 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and another judgment 
rendered DISMISSING plaintiff-appelleeâs complaint, docketed as Civil 
Case No. 85-32243. There is no pronouncement as to costs.â 




The Facts
 


The undisputed factual antecedents, as narrated by the trial court and adopted by public respondent, are as follows:
[6]
 




âx x x [O]n or about September 16, 1975 Associated Banking 
Corporation and Citizens Bank and Trust Company merged to form just one 
banking corporation known as Associated Citizens Bank, the surviving 
bank. On or about March 10, 1981, the Associated Citizens Bank changed 
its corporate name to Associated Bank by virtue of the Amended Articles 
of Incorporation. On September 7, 1977, the defendant executed in favor 
of Associated Bank a promissory note whereby the former undertook to pay
 the latter the sum of P2,500,000.00 payable on or before March 6, 1978.
 As per said promissory note, the defendant agreed to pay interest at 
14% per annum, 3% per annum in the form of liquidated damages, 
compounded interests, and attorneyâs fees, in case of litigation 
equivalent to 10% of the amount due. The defendant, to date, still owes 
plaintiff bank the amount of P2,250,000.00 exclusive of interest and 
other charges. Despite repeated demands the defendant failed to pay the 
amount due. 


xxx  xxx                                          xxx      


x x x [T]he defendant denied all the pertinent allegations in the
 complaint and alleged as affirmative and[/]or special defenses that the
 complaint states no valid cause of action; that the plaintiff is not 
the proper party in interest because the promissory note was executed in
 favor of Citizens Bank and Trust Company; that the promissory note does
 not accurately reflect the true intention and agreement of the parties;
 that terms and conditions of the promissory note are onerous and must 
be construed against the creditor-payee bank; that several partial 
payments made in the promissory note are not properly applied; that the 
present action is premature; that as compulsory counterclaim the 
defendant prays for attorneyâs fees, moral damages and expenses of 
litigation. 


On May 22, 1986, the defendant was declared as if in default for 
failure to appear at the Pre-Trial Conference despite due notice.      


A Motion to Lift Order of Default and/or Reconsideration of Order
 dated May 22, 1986 was filed by defendantâs counsel which was denied by
 the Court in [an] order dated September 16, 1986 and the plaintiff was 
allowed to present its evidence before the Court ex-parte on October 16,
 1986. 


At the hearing before the Court ex-parte, Esteban C. Ocampo 
testified that x x x he is an accountant of the Loans and Discount 
Department of the plaintiff bank; that as such, he supervises the 
accounting section of the bank, he counterchecks all the transactions 
that transpired during the day and is responsible for all the accounts 
and records and other things that may[ ]be assigned to the Loans and 
Discount Department; that he knows the [D]efendant Lorenzo Sarmiento, 
Jr. because he has an outstanding loan with them as per their records; 
that Lorenzo Sarmiento, Jr. executed a promissory note No. TL-2649-77 
dated September 7, 1977 in the amount of P2,500,000.00 (Exhibit A); that
 Associated Banking Corporation and the Citizens Bank and Trust Company 
merged to form one banking corporation known as the Associated Citizens 
Bank and is now known as Associated Bank by virtue of its Amended 
Articles of Incorporation; that there were partial payments made but not
 full; that the defendant has not paid his obligation as evidenced by 
the latest statement of account (Exh. B); that as per statement of 
account the outstanding obligation of the defendant is P5,689,413.63 
less P1,000,000.00 or P4,689,413.63 (Exh. B, B-1); that a demand letter 
dated June 6, 1985 was sent by the bank thru its counsel (Exh. C) which 
was received by the defendant on November 12, 1985 (Exh. C, C-1, C-2, 
C-3); that the defendant paid only P1,000,000.00 which is reflected in 
the Exhibit C.â    




Based on the evidence presented by petitioner, the trial court 
ordered Respondent Sarmiento to pay the bank his remaining balance plus 
interests and attorneyâs fees. In his appeal, Sarmiento assigned to the 
trial court several errors, namely:
[7]
 




âI         The [trial court] erred in denying appellantâs motion 
to dismiss appellee bankâs complaint on the ground of lack of cause of 
action and for being barred by prescription and laches. 


II          The same lower court erred in admitting 
plaintiff-appellee bankâs amended complaint while defendant-appellantâs 
motion to dismiss appellee bankâs original complaint and using/availing 
[itself of] the new additional allegations as bases in denial of said 
appellantâs motion and in the interpretation and application of the 
agreement of merger and Section 80 of BP Blg. 68, Corporation Code of 
the Philippines. 


III         The [trial court] erred and gravely abuse[d] its 
discretion in rendering the two as if in default orders dated May 22, 
1986 and September 16, 1986 and in not reconsidering the same upon 
technical grounds which in effect subvert the best primordial interest 
of substantial justice and equity.      


IV        The court a quo erred in issuing the orders dated May 
22, 1986 and September 16, 1986 declaring appellant as if in default due
 to non-appearance of appellantâs attending counsel who had resigned 
from the law firm and while the parties [were] negotiating for 
settlement of the case and after a one million peso payment had in fact 
been paid to appellee bank for appellantâs account at the start of such 
negotiation on February 18, 1986 as act of earnest desire to settle the 
obligation in good faith by the interested parties. 


V         The lower court erred in according credence to appellee
 bankâs Exhibit B statement of account which had been merely requested 
by its counsel during the trial and bearing date of September 30, 1986. 


VI        The lower court erred in accepting and giving credence 
to appellee bankâs 27-year-old witness Esteban C. Ocampo as of the date 
he testified on October 16, 1986, and therefore, he was merely an 
eighteen-year-old minor when appellant supposedly incurred the foisted 
obligation under the subject PN No. TL-2649-77 dated September 7, 1977, 
Exhibit A of appellee bank. 


VII       The [trial court] erred in adopting appellee bankâs 
Exhibit B dated September 30, 1986 in its decision given in open court 
on October 17, 1986 which exacted eighteen percent (18%) per annum on 
the foisted principal amount of P2.5 million when the subject PN, 
Exhibit A, stipulated only fourteen percent (14%) per annum and which 
was actually prayed for in appellee bankâs original and amended 
complaints. 


VIII      The appealed decision of the lower court erred in not 
considering at all appellantâs affirmative defenses that (1) the subject
 PN No. TL-2649-77 for P2.5 million dated September 7, 1977, is merely 
an accommodation pour autrui bereft of any actual consideration to 
appellant himself and (2) the subject PN is a contract of adhesion, 
hence, [it] needs [to] be strictly construed against appellee bank -- 
assuming for granted that it has the right to enforce and seek 
collection thereof. 


IX        The lower court should have at least allowed appellant 
the opportunity to present countervailing evidence considering the huge 
amounts claimed by appellee bank (principal sum of P2.5 million which 
including accrued interests, penalties and cost of litigation totaled 
P4,689,413.63) and appellantâs affirmative defenses -- pursuant to 
substantial justice and equity.â    




The appellate court, however, found no need to tackle all the 
assigned errors and limited itself to the question of âwhether [herein 
petitioner had] established or proven a cause of action against [herein 
private respondent].â Accordingly, Respondent Court held that the 
Associated Bank had no cause of action against Lorenzo Sarmiento Jr., 
since said bank was not privy to the promissory note executed by 
Sarmiento in favor of Citizens Bank and Trust Company (CBTC). The court 
ruled that the earlier merger between the two banks could not have 
vested Associated Bank with any interest arising from the promissory 
note executed in favor of CBTC 
after
 such merger.      


Thus, as earlier stated, Respondent Court set aside the decision of
 the trial court and dismissed the complaint. Petitioner now comes to us
 for a reversal of this ruling.
[8]
 


Issues
 


In its petition, petitioner cites the following âreasonsâ:
[9]
 


âI   The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the decision of the 
trial court and in declaring that petitioner has no cause of action 
against respondent over the promissory note.      


II    The Court of Appeals also erred in declaring that, since the 
promissory note was executed in favor of Citizens Bank and Trust Company
 two years after the merger between Associated Banking Corporation and 
Citizens Bank and Trust Company, respondent is not liable to petitioner 
because there is no privity of contract between respondent and 
Associated Bank. 


III   The Court of Appeals erred when it ruled that petitioner, 
despite the merger between petitioner and Citizens Bank and Trust 
Company, is not a real party in interest insofar as the promissory note 
executed in favor of the merger.â    


In a nutshell, the main issue is whether Associated Bank, the 
surviving corporation, may enforce the promissory note made by private 
respondent in favor of CBTC, the absorbed company, after the merger 
agreement had been signed.    


The Courtâs Ruling 


The petition is impressed with merit.      


The Main Issue:


Associated Bank Assumed

      All Rights of CBTC


Ordinarily, in the merger of two or more existing corporations,
 one of the combining corporations survives and continues the combined 
business, while the rest are dissolved and all their rights, properties 
and liabilities are acquired by the surviving corporation.
[10]

 Although there is a dissolution of the absorbed corporations, there is 
no winding up of their affairs or liquidation of their assets, because 
the surviving corporation automatically acquires all their rights, 
privileges and powers, as well as their liabilities.
[11]
 


The merger, however, does not become effective upon the mere 
agreement of the constituent corporations. The procedure to be followed 
is prescribed under the Corporation Code.
[12]

 Section 79 of said Code requires the approval by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) of the articles of merger which, in turn, must
 have been duly approved by a majority of the respective stockholders of
 the constituent corporations. The same provision further states that 
the merger shall be effective only upon the issuance by the SEC of a 
certificate of merger. The effectivity date of the merger is crucial for
 determining when the merged or absorbed corporation ceases to exist; 
and when its rights, privileges, properties as well as liabilities pass 
on to the surviving corporation.  


Consistent with the aforementioned Section 79, the September 16, 1975 Agreement of Merger,
[13]

 which Associated Banking Corporation (ABC) and Citizens Bank and Trust 
Company (CBTC) entered into, provided that its effectivity âshall, for 
all intents and purposes, be the date when the necessary papers to carry
 out this [m]erger shall have been approved by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.â
[14]
 As to the transfer of the properties of CBTC to ABC, the agreement provides: 




â10.   Upon effective date of the Merger, all rights, 
privileges, powers, immunities, franchises, assets and property of 
[CBTC], whether real, personal or mixed, and including [CBTCâs] goodwill
 and tradename, and all debts due to [CBTC] on whatever act, and all 
other things in action belonging to [CBTC] as of the effective date of 
the [m]erger shall be vested in [ABC], the SURVIVING BANK, without need 
of further act or deed, unless by express requirements of law or of a 
government agency, any separate or specific deed of conveyance to 
legally effect the transfer or assignment of any kind of property [or] 
asset is required, in which case such document or deed shall be executed
 accordingly; and all property, rights, privileges, powers, immunities, 
franchises and all appointments, designations and nominations, and all 
other rights and interests of [CBTC] as trustee, executor, 
administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, 
assignee, receiver, trustee of estates of persons mentally ill and in 
every other fiduciary capacity, and all and every other interest of 
[CBTC] shall thereafter be effectually the property of [ABC] as they 
were of [CBTC], and title to any real estate, whether by deed or 
otherwise, vested in [CBTC] shall not revert or be in any way impaired 
by reason thereof; provided, however, that all rights of creditors and 
all liens upon any property of [CBTC] shall be preserved and unimpaired 
and all debts, liabilities, obligations, duties and undertakings of 
[CBTC], whether contractual or otherwise, expressed or implied, actual 
or contingent, shall henceforth attach to [ABC] which shall be 
responsible therefor and may be enforced against [ABC] to the same 
extent as if the same debts, liabilities, obligations, duties and 
undertakings have been originally incurred or contracted by [ABC], 
subject, however, to all rights, privileges, defenses, set-offs and 
counterclaims which [CBTC] has or might have and which shall pertain to 
[ABC].â
[15]
 




The records do not show when the SEC approved the merger. Private 
respondentâs theory is that it took effect on the date of the execution 
of the agreement itself, which was September 16, 1975. Private 
respondent contends that, since he issued the promissory note to CBTC on
 September 7, 1977 -- two years after the merger agreement had been 
executed -- CBTC could not have conveyed or transferred to petitioner 
its interest in the said note, which was not yet in existence at the 
time of the merger. Therefore, petitioner, the surviving bank, has no 
right to enforce the promissory note on private respondent; such right 
properly pertains only to CBTC.  


Assuming that the effectivity date of the merger was the date 
of its execution, we still cannot agree that petitioner no longer has 
any interest in the promissory note. A closer perusal of the merger 
agreement leads to a different conclusion. The provision quoted earlier 
has this other clause: 




âUpon the effective date of the [m]erger, all references to 
[CBTC] in any deed, documents, or other papers of whatever kind or 
nature and wherever found shall be deemed for all intents and purposes, 
references to [ABC], the SURVIVING BANK, as if such references were 
direct references to [ABC]. x x xâ
[16]
 (Underscoring supplied)  




Thus, the fact that the promissory note was executed after the 
effectivity date of the merger does not militate against petitioner. The
 agreement itself clearly provides that all contracts -- irrespective of
 the date of execution -- entered into in the name of CBTC shall be 
understood as pertaining to the surviving bank, herein petitioner. 
Since, in contrast to the earlier aforequoted provision, the latter 
clause no longer specifically refers only to contracts existing at the 
time of the merger, no distinction should be made. The clause must have 
been deliberately included in the agreement in order to protect the 
interests of the combining banks; specifically, to avoid giving the 
merger agreement a farcical interpretation aimed at evading fulfillment 
of a due obligation.  


Thus, although the subject promissory note names CBTC as the 
payee, the reference to CBTC in the note shall be construed, under the 
very provisions of the merger agreement, as a reference to petitioner 
bank, âas if such reference [was a] direct reference toâ the latter âfor
 all intents and purposes.â 


No other construction can be given to the unequivocal 
stipulation. Being clear, plain and free of ambiguity, the provision 
must be given its literal meaning
[17]
 and applied without a convoluted interpretation. 
Verba legis non est recedendum
.
[18]
 


In light of the foregoing, the Court holds that petitioner has a
 valid cause of action against private respondent. Clearly, the failure 
of private respondent to honor his obligation under the promissory note 
constitutes a violation of petitionerâs right to collect the proceeds of
 the loan it extended to the former.  


Secondary Issues:


Prescription, Laches, Contract
 
      Pour Autrui, 
Lack of Consideration
 


No Prescription
      or Laches
 


Private respondentâs claim that the action has prescribed, 
pursuant to Article 1149 of the Civil Code, is legally untenable. 
Petitionerâs suit for collection of a sum of money was based on a 
written contract and prescribes after ten years from the time its right 
of action arose.
[19]
 
Sarmientoâs obligation under the promissory note became due and 
demandable on March 6, 1978. Petitionerâs complaint was instituted on 
August 22, 1985, before the lapse of the ten-year prescriptive period. 
Definitely, petitioner still had every right to commence suit against 
the payor/obligor, the private respondent herein.      


Neither is petitionerâs action barred by laches. The principle 
of laches is a creation of equity, which is applied not to penalize 
neglect or failure to assert a right within a reasonable time, but 
rather to avoid recognizing a right when to do so would result in a 
clearly inequitable situation
[20]
 or in an injustice.
[21]

 To require private respondent to pay the remaining balance of his loan 
is certainly not inequitable or unjust. What would be manifestly unjust 
and inequitable is his contention that CBTC is the proper party to 
proceed against him despite the fact, which he himself asserts, that 
CBTCâs corporate personality has been dissolved by virtue of its merger 
with petitioner. To hold that no payee/obligee exists and to let private
 respondent enjoy the fruits of his loan without liability is surely 
most unfair and unconscionable, amounting to unjust enrichment at the 
expense of petitioner. Besides, this Court has held that the doctrine of
 laches is inapplicable where the claim was filed within the 
prescriptive period set forth under the law.
[22]
 


No Contract

      Pour Autrui
 


Private respondent, while not denying that he executed the 
promissory note in the amount of P2,500,000 in favor of CBTC, offers the
 alternative defense that said note was a contract 
pour autrui
.      


A stipulation 
pour autrui
 is one in favor of a third 
person who may demand its fulfillment, provided he communicated his 
acceptance to the obligor before its revocation. An incidental benefit 
or interest, which another person gains, is not sufficient. The 
contracting parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor
 upon a third person.
[23]
 


Florentino vs. Encarnacion Sr.
[24]

 enumerates the requisites for such contract: (1) the stipulation in 
favor of a third person must be a part of the contract, and not the 
contract itself; (2) the favorable stipulation should not be conditioned
 or compensated by any kind of obligation; and (3) neither of the 
contracting parties bears the legal representation or authorization of 
the third party. The âfairest testâ in determining whether the third 
personâs interest in a contract is a stipulation 
pour autrui
 or merely an incidental interest is to examine the intention of the parties as disclosed by their contract.
[25]
 


We carefully and thoroughly perused the promissory note, but 
found no stipulation at all that would even resemble a provision in 
consideration of a third person. The instrument itself does not disclose
 the purpose of the loan contract. It merely lays down the terms of 
payment and the penalties incurred for failure to pay upon maturity. It 
is patently devoid of any indication that a benefit or interest was 
thereby created in favor of a person other than the contracting parties.
 In fact, in no part of the instrument is there any mention of a third 
party at all. Except for his barefaced statement, no evidence was 
proffered by private respondent to support his argument. Accordingly, 
his contention cannot be sustained. At any rate, if indeed the loan 
actually benefited a third person who undertook to repay the bank, 
private respondent could have availed himself of the legal remedy of a 
third-party complaint.
[26]
 That he made no effort to implead such third person proves the hollowness of his arguments.      


Consideration
 


Private respondent also claims that he received no 
consideration for the promissory note and, in support thereof, cites 
petitionerâs failure to submit any proof of his loan application and of 
his actual receipt of the amount loaned. These arguments deserve no 
merit. 
Res ipsa loquitur
. The instrument, bearing the signature
 of private respondent, speaks for itself. Respondent Sarmiento has not 
questioned the genuineness and due execution thereof. No further proof 
is necessary to show that he undertook to pay P2,500,000, plus interest,
 to petitioner bank on or before March 6, 1978. This he failed to do, as
 testified to by petitionerâs accountant. The latter presented before 
the trial court private respondentâs statement of account
[27]

 as of September 30, 1986, showing an outstanding balance of 
P4,689,413.63 after deducting P1,000,000.00 paid seven months earlier. 
Furthermore, such partial payment is equivalent to an express 
acknowledgment of his obligation. Private respondent can no longer 
backtrack and deny his liability to petitioner bank. âA person cannot 
accept and reject the same instrument.â
