[ G.R. No. 126363, June 26, 1998 ]


THE CONGREGATION OF THE RELIGIOUS OF THE VIRGIN MARY PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS AND SPOUSES JEROME AND TERESA PROTASIO, RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


Petitioner, The Congregation Of The Religious Of The Virgin Mary,
 has filed this petition for review on certiorari, urging us to reverse 
the decision
[1]
 of the Court 
of Appeals dated September 12, 1996, in CA-G.R. CV No. 43311, entitled 
âSPS. JEROME and TERESA PROTASIO, Plaintiffs-Appellees, versus, THE 
RELIGIOUS OF THE VIRGIN MARY, Defendant-Appellant.â The decision 
affirmed the judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City in Civil
 Case No. 29,960-91, ordering the petitioner to return the possession of
 the disputed land to the respondents-spouses and to pay them damages.

The facts of this case, as found by the respondent court,
[2]
 are as follows: 

On December 26, 1964, Gervacio Serapio, the grandfather of herein
 respondents-spouses Jerome and Teresa Protasio, sold to herein 
petitioner, the Congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary, two 
(2) lots identified as Lot No. 5-A and Lot No. 5-C which were covered by
 TCT Nos. 14834 and 14835, respectively. In between Lot No. 5-A and Lot 
No. 5-C is Lot No. 5-B. Petitioner did not buy it when it was offered 
for sale by Gervacio Serapio. In 1978, Gervacio died and his estate 
consisting of several parcels of land was settled extra-judicially among
 his heirs. 

In October of 1989, respondents-spouses purchased Lot No. 5-B 
from the heirs of Gervacio Serapio. Accordingly, TCT No. 148595 was 
issued in their name. Sometime in November of 1989, respondents-spouses 
had the subject Lot No. 5-B surveyed and they discovered that 664 square
 meters of their 858 square meters property was fenced and occupied by 
petitioner. They also found out that a building for the boysâ quarters 
and a portion of petitionerâs gymnasium were constructed inside Lot No. 
5-B. The encroachment by petitioner on respondents-spouses land was made
 without the latterâs knowledge and consent. Despite repeated demands by
 respondents-spouses, petitioner failed and refused to (1) restore to 
the spouses possession of the encroached property; (2) demolish the 
improvements constructed thereon, and (3) pay damages and back rentals. 
Thus, on September 23, 1991, a complaint for recovery of possession of 
real property, damages, back rentals and attorney's fees was filed by 
respondents-spouses against the petitioner. The complaint was docketed 
as Civil Case No. 20,960-91 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, 
Branch 15. In answer to the complaint, petitioner admitted that it 
occupies part of the litigated property but averred that Lot No. 5-B was
 supposed to be a road lot that would give their Lots 5-A and 5-C means 
of entry and egress to the public road and, therefore, was beyond the 
commerce of man. Petitioner further claims that respondents-spouses, as 
successors-in-interest of Gervacio Serapio, have the obligation to 
respect the perpetual use of Lot No. 5-B ceded to it by Serapio.

After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered judgment in 
favor of respondents-spouses and against the petitioner. It rejected 
petitionerâs claim of being a builder in good faith of the improvements 
it introduced on the disputed lot of respondents-spouses. The 
dispositive portion of the decision dated July 30, 1993 reads:



âWHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering the defendant (now petitioner): 


1. To vacate the part of the plaintiffsâ (now respondents-spousesâ)
 lot covered by TCT No. 148595 it is presently occupying and to 
peaceably return the possession to the plaintiffs at its own expense. 


2. To demolish the buildings and improvements it introduced on the lot of the plaintiffs at its own expense.
  


3. To pay one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) as moral damages.
  


4. To pay back rentals of fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00) with 
legal interests to be computed from January 31, 1991 until fully paid.
  


5. To pay one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) as attorneyâs 
fees, four thousand pesos (P4,000.00) as litigation expenses and the 
costs of suit. 


âSO ORDERED.â
[3]






Upon appeal by petitioner to the respondent court, the latter affirmed 
in toto
 the judgment of the trial court.

Still dissatisfied, petitioner now comes to us via the present 
petition, assailing the respondent courtâs decision on the following 
grounds:



âI 


THE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT PRIVATE 
RESPONDENTSâ ANCESTOR, GERVACIO SERAPIO, HAD CEDED TO THE PETITIONER THE
 PERPETUAL USE OF LOT 5-B. 


II
  


THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRIEVOUSLY IGNORED THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD AND
 ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTSâ CLAIM HAD CLEARLY BEEN 
BARRED BY LACHES. 


III
  


THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT 
AWARDED ACTUAL DAMAGES IN THE FORM OF BACK RENTALS WITHOUT PROOF TO 
SUPPORT THE SAME.
  


IV
  


THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN AWARDING MORAL DAMAGES TO PRIVATE RESPONDENTS â
  


(A) IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRAYER FOR THE AWARD NOR PROOF OF THE SAME.
  


(B) IN THE FACE OF EVIDENCE CLEARLY SHOWING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTS WERE PURCHASERS IN BAD FAITH.â
[4]






The above-quoted errors allegedly committed by the respondent court call for a review of its 
findings of facts
.
 As a general rule, the re-examination of the evidence submitted by the 
contending parties during the trial of the case is not a function that 
this Court normally undertakes inasmuch as the findings of facts of the 
respondent court are generally binding and conclusive on the Supreme 
Court.
[5]
 The jurisdiction of 
this Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 
Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law,
[6]
 not of fact, 
unless

 the factual findings complained of are devoid of support by the 
evidence on record or the assailed judgment is based on misapprehension 
of facts.
[7]


Petitioner contends that its case should be treated as an 
exception to the said general rule since the respondent court 
âoverlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which if
 properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.â
[8]


Let us examine these ârelevant factsâ which the respondent court allegedly overlooked when it rendered the assailed decision.

First. Petitioner maintains that Gervacio Serapio, the original 
owner of the land in question (Lot 5-B), had in his lifetime 
represented, committed and warranted that the said lot would be for 
petitionerâs perpetual use as a road lot, it being the only access to 
the public road for Lot 5-A and Lot 5-C, and to each other.
[9]


In support of this posture, petitioner cited the document entitled âAgreement Of Purchase And Saleâ
[10]

 dated July 8, 1959, executed between Gervacio Serapio and petitioner, 
which Agreement shows a sketch attached thereto as Annex âAâ
[11]

 indicating the location of the two (2) lots subject of the Agreement 
and two (2) proposed roads, the Simeon de Jesus St. and Padre Faura St. 
(which is the disputed Lot B). Petitioner argues that âwithout that map 
(sketch) and the implicit assurance that goes with it, there could not 
have been a sale.â
[12]


There is nothing significant in the said sketch which would 
justify a reversal of the findings and conclusions reached by the 
respondent court. It is merely a sketch of the location of the two (2) 
lots subject of the sale. There is no express or implied agreement in 
said annex containing the sketch which would confirm petitionerâs claim 
that Geronimo Serapio âhad ceded to the petitioner the perpetual use of 
Lot 5-B.â If petitionerâs claim was true, then the same could have 
easily been inserted as an additional agreement between the parties. 
That it was not made so, only shows that petitionerâs claim is nothing 
but a mere conjecture, which has zero evidentiary weight. Section 9, 
Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court provides in part that where, as 
here, âthe terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, 
it
 is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be,
 between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of 
such terms other than the contents of the written agreement
.â Simply put, any oral evidence of an agreement should be 
excluded
 when after all, the existing agreement is already in writing.
[13]
 Thus, we are not prepared to disturb the following findings and conclusions of the respondent court:



âAppellant first argues that the original owner of the subject 
land, Gervacio Serapio, had intended, represented and warranted that the
 same would be for its perpetual use as a road lot. Involving as it does
 a transmission of real rights, this claim should be based on something 
more concrete than bare allegations and speculations. In the instant 
case, however, there is notably no concrete evidence supporting 
appellantâs claim. 


âAppellant would have Us believe that the map attached to the 
Agreement of Purchase and Sale between it and Gervacio Serapio, 
containing as it does the proposed roads in the area, implicitly carries
 the assurance that Gervacio Serapio had made with respect to said 
proposed roads. 


âEven the most careful perusal of the map attached to the Agreement
 of Purchase and Sale between appellant and Gervacio Serapio, however, 
does not reveal anything other than that it merely shows the location of
 the lots subject of such Agreement. Indeed, from the Agreement itself, 
it is clear that said map was attached simply to identify the location 
of the lots covered by the Agreement; and that reference to the map was 
simply as follows â
  




x x x, the SELLER by these presents PROMISE TO SELL to said BUYER, 
these portions of land more particularly identified and designated as Lot Nos. âAâ and âCâ in the sketch hereto attached
 and marked as Annex âA,â xxx. (Exh. 16, Agreement of Purchase and Sale) [underline ours] 




âThere being no provision in the Agreement, whatsoever, regarding 
the subject lot, or the grant of its use unto appellant, We cannot now 
accept appellantâs bare allegations on Gervacio Serapioâs representation
 and warranty that the subject land would be for its perpetual use as a 
road lot. At any rate, it has been ruled that in case of doubt in the 
provisions of the Deed of Sale, the least transmission of rights should 
prevail (Gacos vs. Court of Appeals, 212 SCRA 8). 


âThe rest of appellantâs arguments in support of its claim 
regarding perpetual use of the subject land as a road lot are nothing 
but mere speculations which, as We have stressed, cannot suffice for Us 
to uphold any transmission of real rights. Being painfully bereft of 
concrete evidence, said claim of appellant must be brushed aside.â
[14]






Even if we were to accept as true petitionerâs stance that Lot 5-B 
was intended by Gervacio Serapio as a road right of way for petitionerâs
 perpetual use, still a grant of a right of way in favor of petitioner 
does not legally entitle it to 
occupy
 part of the said lot which is registered in respondents-spousesâ name, more so to 
introduce permanent improvements
 thereon such as a gymnasium and a boysâ quarters/dormitory.

Thus, what is actually at issue here is not whether the 
petitioner could use Lot 5-B in question as a road, but rather whether 
the petitioner could legally possess/occupy part of the said lot. This 
is, in fact, the only issue as agreed upon by the contending parties 
during the pre-trial conference of this case before the trial court.
[15]

 As discussed earlier, petitioner has no right whatsoever to possess and
 construct permanent structures on the questioned land owned by 
respondents-spouses. Petitioner admits in its answer to the complaint 
that it introduced improvements on the subject lot without the consent 
and knowledge of respondents-spouses.
[16]
 It is thus a builder in bad faith. Again, we find no reversible error in the following ruling of the respondent court:



âWhich leads us to a discussion of whether or not appellant was in 
bad faith in introducing improvements on the subject land. It cannot be 
denied that appellant never gained title to the subject land as it 
admits to not having purchased the said lot (TSN, p. 81, November 9, 
1992). Neither has appellant successfully shown any right to introduce 
improvements on the said land (its claim of grant of perpetual use of 
the same as a road lot and its right to build on a right of way both 
having been rejected above). This being so, it follows that appellant 
was a builder in bad faith in that, knowing that the land did not belong
 to it and that it had no right to build thereon, it nevertheless caused
 the improvements in question to be erected. 


âNext, appellant claims that granting that it was in bad faith, 
appellees and their predecessors-in-interest were equally guilty of bad 
faith in allowing the construction of the improvements. This bad faith 
on the part of the appellees and their predecessors-in-interest should, 
however, have been proved at the hearing below, for in the absence of 
such proof, it must be presumed that with the unlawful trespass upon the
 subject land, the buildings were commenced thereon without the 
knowledge and consent of the owners thereof (Rivera vs. Archbishop of 
Manila, 40 Phil. 717). Again, We find such proof absent in the instant 
case."
[17]






Second. Petitioner contends that the respondent court struck down its
 defense of laches âwith a grossly erroneous and unfair declaration that
 since the private respondents themselves did not sleep on their rights,
 there could be no laches.â
[18]

 Suffice it to state that no evidence was presented by petitioner during
 the trial to prove that the improvements constructed on the subject 
property were made during the lifetime of Gervacio Serapio, nor that 
Serapio, his heirs or respondents-spouses were aware of, much less 
tolerated, the said structures so as to make them guilty of laches. In 
this regard, we find the respondent courtâs disputation on the issue of 
laches proper:



"Neither are We convinced by appellantâs argument that appelleeâs 
claim is barred by laches. In Olizon vs. Court of Appeals, 236 SCRA 148,
 the Supreme Court once again defined laches â
  




xxx as the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and 
unexplained length of time, to do that which by exercising due diligence
 could or should have been done earlier: it is negligence or omission to
 assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that 
the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to 
assert it.
    




âHere, the improvements introduced by appellant were finished in 
1988. In November 1989, a month after appellees purchased the subject 
lot, they had the same surveyed, after which they immediately sought to 
inform the appellant about the encroachment they had discovered (TSN, 
pp. 8-11, August 26, 1992). Thereafter, on October 26, 1990, appellees, 
through their lawyer, sent a demand letter to appellant regarding the 
matter, followed by another demand letter dated January 31, 1991. 
Finally the Complaint was filed on September 23, 1991. All told, We do 
not find laches to have set in to effectively bar appellees from the 
claims contained in their Complaint. By any indication, the lapse of a 
mere three (3) years from the time the improvements were constructed up 
to the time of the filing of the Complaint cannot be construed as 
sufficient to hold the complainant as barred by laches. Especially so 
since during the interim, appellees were diligent in having the subject 
land surveyed and in sending demand letters to appellant.â
[19]






Third. Petitioner claims that the respondent court committed grave 
abuse of discretion when it awarded respondents-spouses actual damages 
in the form of back rentals of P15,000.00 a month, plus the legal rate 
of interest, to be reckoned from January, 1991, without proof to support
 the same. We have examined the respondents-spousesâ complaint and the 
testimony of respondent Jerome Protasio on the matter of back rentals 
prayed for in the complaint, and we find no factual basis how such award
 was arrived at. Thus, we have to discard such award of damages. A party
 is entitled to an adequate compensation for such pecuniary loss 
actually suffered by him as he has duly proved
.
[20]

 Such damages, to be recoverable, must not only be capable of proof, but
 must actually be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty.
[21]
 These damages cannot be presumed,
[22]

 and the courts in making such award of damages must point out specific 
facts which could afford a basis for measuring whatever compensatory or 
actual damages are borne.
[23]


Fourth. We also agree with the petitioner that the respondent 
court should not have awarded respondents-spouses moral damages of 
P100,000.00 simply because their complaint did not specifically ask for 
such relief. Moral damages must be disallowed when it is not 
specifically prayed for in the complaint.
[24]
 It is elementary that in order that moral damages may be awarded, there must be 
pleading
 and 
proof
 of moral suffering, mental anguish, fright and the like,
[25]
 both of which are absent in this case.

Finally. We further agree with the petitioner that the award of 
attorneyâs fees of P100,000.00 should be eliminated for lack of factual 
basis and legal justification. The only evidence to support 
respondents-spousesâ claim for attorneyâs fees is the testimony of 
Jerome Protasio to the effect that his agreement with the law firm 
handling his case is that he is obligated to pay â25% of the obligation 
receivable x x x.â
[26]
 That is
 all. Both the trial court and respondent Court of Appeals likewise did 
not cite specific factual basis to justify the award of attorneyâs fees,
 which is in violation of the proscription against the imposition of a 
penalty on the right to litigate.
[27]
 As we enunciated in 
Refractories Corporation of the Philippines vs. Intermediate Appellate Court
:
[28]




âx x x. The award of attorneyâs fees is the exception rather than 
the general rule and counselâs fees is not to be awarded every time a 
party wins a suit. The discretion of the court to award attorneyâs fees 
under Article 2208 of the Civil Code âdemands factual, legal and 
equitable justification, without which the award is a conclusion without
 a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and 
conjecture.â In all events, the court must state the reason for the 
award of attorneyâs fees.â 
  




WHEREFORE
, the decision of the respondent Court of 
Appeals dated September 12, 1996, in CA-G.R. CV No. 43311, is hereby 
MODIFIED in the sense that the awards of back rentals, moral damages and
 attorneyâs fees are hereby DELETED. In all other respects, the assailed
 decision is AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.
