MARTIN V. BRIZUELA, COMPLAINANT, VS. DEPUTY SHERIFFS JOSEPH ANTONIL OF BRANCH 63; ERIBERTO DE CASTRO AND VILLAMOR VILLEGAS OF THE OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENTS.
R E S O L U T I O N




VITUG, J.:


Joseph Antonil, Eriberto de Castro and Villamor Villegas, all Deputy Sheriffs assigned to the Regional Trial Court of Makati,
[1]

 were charged by Martin V. Brizuela with grave misconduct, oppression 
and dishonesty in connection with the alleged wrongful implementation of
 a writ of possession and an 
alias
 writ of possession issued in
 LRC Case No. M-3510. Brizuela, the respondent in the LRC case, averred 
that respondent Sheriffs implemented a writ of possession, dated 24 May 
1995, on 24 August 1995 which was well beyond the sixty-day period 
provided for by the Rules of Court within which the writ could be 
enforced. The complainant claimed that no one was in his house when the 
writ was implemented and respondent Sheriffs merely broke open the steel
 gates of the premises, entered the house, took out the personal 
belongings thereat and placed the items on the garage. He and his 
family, however, were able to later gain possession of the premises but 
only after the security guards posted thereat were told of the pending 
cases with the Court of Appeals involving the property. The complainant 
admitted that the temporary restraining order issued by the Court of 
Appeals had already expired but he maintained that respondent Sheriffs 
should have accorded due courtesy to the appellate court where a motion 
for the reconsideration of the denial of his motion for the issuance of 
an injunctive writ was filed. The complainant added that the irregular 
actuations of respondent Sheriffs were repeated on 01 September 1995 
when the latter returned, accompanied by about a hundred personnel, to 
implement an 
alias
 writ of possession without bothering to wait
 for the resolution of his pending motion for reconsideration with the 
appellate court. This second time around, respondent Sheriffs took 
personal belongings worth about P5,000,000.00.

Respondent Sheriff de Castro, in his comment, dated 12 January 
1996, explained that he only had taken part in the implementation of the
 
alias
 writ of possession. He sought assistance from the 
Station Commander of Block 3, Bangkal, Makati City, because the 
complainant had hired seven heavily armed security guards from the ACD 
Investigation Security Agency in an attempt to thwart the enforcement of
 the writ. De Castro said that he and his fellow respondents did not 
attempt to implement the writ, until after complainant's lawyer arrived 
at about five o'clock in the afternoon, in order to give complainant a 
chance to secure a restraining order. Finally, de Castro maintained, the
 writ had been implemented in accordance with the rules prescribed 
therefor. 

Respondent Sheriff Villegas, in his comment of 12 January 1996, 
informed the Court that he, like his co-respondent de Castro, had only 
taken part in the implementation of the 
alias
 writ of possession. He reiterated, in substance, the statements of de Castro in the latter's comment of even date.

Respondent Sheriff Antonil, in his comment, likewise dated 12 
January 1996, stated for his part that after the issuance of the writ of
 possession by Judge Ruben A. Mendiola of the Regional Trial Court of 
Makati City, he promptly went on to serve it upon the spouses Brizuela 
who were given eight days from receipt thereof within which to vacate 
the premises. Due to the petition to stay the implementation of the writ
 filed by the spouses, he had to hold in abeyance any further action on 
the writ until after the petition was acted upon. The petition was 
denied on 19 June 1995. On 23 June 1995, respondent Antonil served on 
the spouses a notice to vacate the premises. He tried to implement the 
writ on 27 June 1995 only to find out that the premises had been 
padlocked. The Brizuela spouses, in the meantime, sought a 
reconsideration of the denial of their petition to stay the 
implementation of the writ while the counsel for Integrated Credit and 
Corporate Services Company ("Integrated Credit"), the plaintiff in LRC 
Case No. M-3510, filed a motion to break open the premises. On 05 July 
1995, the trial court, without ruling on the motion to break open the 
premises, denied the spouses' motion for reconsideration. The Brizuelas 
went to the Court of Appeals for relief. On 07 July 1995, the appellate 
court issued an order temporarily restraining respondent Antonil from 
implementing the writ of possession. Then, in its resolution of 07 
August 1995, the Court of Appeals denied the Brizuelas' prayer for the 
issuance of a preliminary prohibitory injunction. On 24 August 1995, 
after giving the spouses sufficient time within which to voluntarily 
vacate the premises, respondent Antonil finally implemented, in the 
presence of security guards of Magallanes Village and with the help of 
members of the Magallanes PNP Detachment Unit, the writ of possession. 
The property of the spouses were inventoried and thereafter turned over 
to the security guards of Magallanes Village and the Integrated Credit 
for safekeeping. On 29 August 1995, the trial court issued an alias writ
 of possession which respondent Antonil, together with respondents de 
Castro and Villegas, implemented on 01 September 1995. Respondent 
Sheriffs sought the assistance of the Station Commander of Block 3, 
Bangkal, Makati, after discovering that the Brizuelas had hired seven 
heavily armed security guards from ACD Investigation Security Agency to 
prevent the enforcement of the 
alias
 writ. The 
alias
 writ was implemented only after the counsel for the Brizuelas had failed to secure another restraining order.

In the Court's resolution, dated 05 June 1996, acting upon the 
recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator ("OCA"), the 
complaint was dismissed for lack of merit.

Complainant forthwith moved for a reconsideration. The Court, in 
its resolution of 11 November 1996, required respondents to comment on 
the motion for reconsideration. In its resolution of 22 October 1997, 
the Court, after deliberating on the motion for reconsideration and the 
comments thereon, resolved to so docket the case as an administrative 
matter. The parties were also required to manifest whether or not they 
would be willing to submit the case for resolution on the basis of 
pleadings and documents theretofore filed.

To date, the parties have yet to file the required manifestations, which the Court will now dispense with.

Respondent Antonil did implement the writ of possession only on 
24 August 1995 or 93 days from the date of its issuance on 23 May 1995. 
Even if, indeed, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining 
order on 17 July 1995, it only tolled the running of the 60-day period 
for 20 days. Nevertheless, respondent Sheriff Antonil could not be said 
to have acted in bad faith. He put off the implementation of the writ of
 possession while complainant and his spouse were filing one pleading 
after another in the hope of suspending the enforcement of the writ. 
These circumstances considered, the imposition of a fine of P1,000.00 
recommended by the OCA would be severe. The Court deems it proper to 
instead administer a reprimand on respondent Joseph Antonil. There being
 no irregularity established in the implementation of the 
alias
 writ of possession, respondent Eriberto De Castro and respondent Villamor Villegas are absolved from any liability therefor.

WHEREFORE
, respondent Sheriff Joseph Antonil is 
REPRIMANDED and cautioned to be more circumspect than he has heretofore 
shown. The administrative charges against respondent Eriberto De Castro 
and respondent Villamor Villegas are dismissed.

SO ORDERED
.

Davide, Jr., Belossillo, Panganiban,
 and 
Quisumbing JJ.
, concur.
