HONOR P. MOSLARES, PETITIONER, VS. THIRD DIVISION, COURT OF APPEALS, HON. ERIBERTO ROSARIO, JR., PRESIDING JUDGE, BR. 66, MAKATI; TOYOTA BEL-AIR, INC., RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




MELO, J.:


Petitioner Honor P. Morales seeks to set aside the decision of 
the Court of Appeals in its CA-G.R. SP No. 40086, dismissing his 
petition for review and affirming the order dated September 13, 1995 of 
the Regional Trial Court of the National Capital Judicial Region (Makati
 City, Branch 66), declaring petitioner to have waived his right to 
present evidence, and affirming too the decision of the same regional 
trial court dated October 26, 1995 finding petitioner guilty of 
violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (Criminal Case No. 22-0099) which 
decision was promulgated in absentia. Likewise, petitioner seeks to 
nullify respondent appellate court's resolutions dated April 11, 1997 
denying his petition for bail.

The antecedental facts may be chronicled in the following manner:

On February 19, 1991, petitioner purchased three units of Toyota 
Corolla 1600 from Toyota Bel-Air, Inc which were thereupon registered 
under his name, under the name of Manila Construction Development 
Corporation of the Philippines, and under the name of Austra-Phil Homes 
Inc. In payment thereof, petitioner issued Philippine Bank of 
Commissions Check No. 841644 dated May 24, 1991 in the amount of 
P1,425,780.00. When presented for payment, said check was dishonored for
 having been drawn against insufficient funds. Thus, petitioner was 
charged for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 and for Estafa.

The hearings of the case were postponed several times either at 
the instance of the petitioner or the prosecution, or motu proprio by 
the court. On Septmenber 13, 1995, the scheduled date of the 
presentation of evidence by petitioner, he failed to appear, but was 
represented by a newly retained lawyer, Atty. Dionisio Landero, who 
claimed that he was not ready to proceed with the trial as he was not 
yet familiar with the case. As a result, the trial court set the 
promulgation of the decision on October 30, 1995.

On October 9, 1995, petitioner filed a Motion for 
Recorsideration/Re Trial. However, on October 26, 1995 the trial court 
issued its assailed decision, portions of which read:



The record shows that accused Honor Moslares did not attend during 
the presentation of evidence for the prosecution nor for the defense. 
The Court set the presentation of evidence for the defense nineteen (19)
 times four (4) of which were cancelled on the ground that there was a 
typhoon and the public prosecutor was 'indisposed'. But the accused did 
not even testify and presented only one witness, a certain Sixto Avila. 
Subject cases were submitted for decision four (4) times for failure of 
the accused to present evidence but was lifted in the interest of 
justice upon motion of the accused. He changed his lawyer four times 
everytime the Court ordered the case submitted for decision for failure 
of the accused to present his evidenced inorder to gain a delay.

Moslares guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Batas Pambansa 
Bilang 22 and the Court hereby sentences Honor Moslares to suffer an 
imprisonment of one year (1) year.
    


2)      In Criminal Case No. 92-0100 finding accused Honor 
Moslares guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Batas Bilang 22 
and the Court hereby sentences Honor Moslares to suffer an imprisonment 
of one (1) year. 
    


(pp. 111-112; 114, Rollo.)
    






On October 30, 1995, the trial court proceeded to promulgate in absentia the October 26, 1996 decision.

On November 14, 1995, petitioner filed a notice of appeal which 
was denied due course by the lower court in its assailed order dated 
dated February 1, 1996. The lower court, relying on the case of People 
vs. Mapalao (197 SCRA 79[1991]), considered petitioner to have waived 
his right to appeal.

On February 14, 1996, petitioner filed a petition for relief from
 judgment which was likewise denied by the trial court. On March 14, 
1996, petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals 
which treated the petition as one for certiorari. Petitioner also filed 
on October 3, 1996, a petition to post bail, later supplemented.

On November 29, 1996, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision 
dismissing the petition for review and denying the petition to post 
bail. Motions for reconsideration subsequently filed by petitioner were 
denied.

Hence, the instant recourse, with petitioner contending that the Court of Appeals erred:



I.      IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE LOWER COURT DECLARING THAT
 THE PETITIONER HAD WAIVED HIS RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE BY NUMEROUS 
POSTPONEMENTS THEREBY DEPRIVING PETITIONER HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.
  


II.        IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE LOWER COURT WHICH WAS 
PROMULGATED IN ABSENTIA WITHOUT GIVING PETITIONER AN OPPURTUNITY TO 
PRESENT EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF HIS DEFENSE.
  


III.       IN RULING THAT PETITIONER HAS NO VALID DEFENSE.
  


IV.      IN SUSTAINING ACTION OF LOWER COURT DISMISSING APPEAL THEREBY DENYING HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.
  


V.       IN DENYING PETITIONER'S APLLICATION FOR BAIL.
  


(p. 10, Rollo)
  




Anent the first and second which are related, the Court of Appeals 
agreed with the trial court that petitioner should be considered to have
 waived his right to present further evidence because of his repeated 
failure to attend scheduled hearings.

While it is true that the right to present evidence may be waived
 expressly or impliedly, it cannot be said that petitioner had waived 
said right in this case. The postponement sought by petitioner and 
counsel appear to be justified and were not vexatious and oppressive as 
borne by the record of the case. The intention and the willingness of 
petitioner to present evidence can be gleaned from the fact that he had 
already presented one witness and has other witnesses ready for 
presentation, although this was delayed, but for meritorious reasons, 
such as illness of the petitioner and his counsel, petitioner's 
confinement at a hospital, ongoing negotiations between the parties, and
 substitution of counsel.

The rights of an accused during trial are given paramount 
importance in our laws and rules on criminal procedure. Among the 
fundamental rights of the accused is the right to be heard by himself 
and counsel. Verily, this right is even guaranteed by the Constitution 
itself. This right has been recognized and established in order to make 
sure that justice is done to the accused.

Further, the constitution right of the accused to be heard in his
 defense is inviolate. No court of justice under our system of 
government has the power to deprive him of that right (
People vs. Lumague, Jr.
, 111 SCRA 515 [1982]).

It would have thus been more befitting and seemly of the Court of
 Appeals had it ordered the trial court to reopen the case for the 
reception of petitioner's evidence. Granting that petitioner had sought a
 number of postponements, the requirements of substantial justice 
mandate that he should have been given his day in court. The grant of a 
reasonable continuance would have been sounder judicial discretion to 
ferret out the truth, than to have a speedy disposition of the case, but
 at the expense of a fundamental right.

Hence, it was error for the trial court to have proceeded with 
the promulgation of decision on the premise that petitioner had waived 
his right to appear in court to present his evidence. Likewise, the 
Court of Appeals, in affirming said decision, gravely abused its 
discretion as it sustained a decision of the lower court rendered in 
violation of the right of petitioner to due process. As enunciated in 
the case of 
Alliance of Democratic Free Labor Organization vs. Laguesma
 (254 SCRA 565 [1996]), the most basic tenet of due process is the right to heard.

As regards the third assigned error, the Court of Appeals held 
that the defense sought to be established by petitioner would not, even 
if considered by the court, exonerate him from his criminal liability 
under Batas Pambansa Blg. 22. This disclaration seems to be no less 
than, and is tantamount to, prejudging the nature of the testimony of 
petitioner and his witnesses.

It is worthy to note that the alleged criminal liability of 
petitioner stems from his being the signatory of the questioned check 
and his being an officer of the corporation, the actual purchaser of the
 cars. As mentioned by the Solicitor General in his Manifestation, and 
citing the case of 
Lina Lim Lao vs. Court of Appeals
 (274 SCRA 
572 [1997]), an officer of a corporation is not to be held criminally 
liable for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 for signing a bum check, 
upon which premise, the Solicitor General concludes and recommends that 
petitioner be given his opportunity to present his evidence.

With respect to the fourth error, the lower court, in denying 
petitioner's appeal, considered him to have waived his right to appeal 
because of his failure to be present during the promulgation of the 
judgment on October 30, 1995, despite due notice to him and his bondsman
 or counsel.

We do not agree.

The last sentence of Section 6, Rule 120 states that:



â¦ If the judgment is for conviction, and the accused's failure to 
appear was without justifiable cause, the court shall further order the 
arrest of the accused, who may appeal within fifteen (15) days from 
notice of the decision to him or his counsel. 




This means that whether or not the absence of the accused during 
promulgation is justified, the right to appeal is not lost, the only 
requirement being that the notice of appeal must be filed within 15 days
 notice of the judgment.

The 
Mapalao
 ruling (197 SCRA 79 [1991]), upon h the 
lower court and the court of Appeals based their denial of petitioner's 
appeal, does not appear to be applicable herein, as the facts of the two
 cases differ. In 
Mapalao
, the accused escaped from detention and trial 
in absentia

 continued against him. He remained at larged even at the time of the 
promulgation of judgment, and thus, was deemed to have waived his right 
to appeal. In the instant case, however, petitioner is not a fugitive 
from justice. On the contrary, petitioner has been seeking redres under 
the law as evidenced by the various pleadings and motions he has filed 
with the courts. Petitioer, therefore, cannot be considered as one who 
has lost his standing in court and thus, cannot be deprived of his right
 to seek judicial relief.

Inasmuch as petitioner's appeal was perfected within the 15-day 
reglementary period, the samemust be given due course. To deny 
petitioner's appeal is tantamount to denying him due process. Although 
the right to appeal is a statutory, not a natural right, it is an 
essential part of the judicial system and courts should proceed with 
caution so as not to deprive a party of this prerogative, but instead, 
afford every party-litigant the amplest oppurtunity for the proper and 
just disposition of his cause, freed from the constrainsts of 
technicalities (
Santos vs. Court of Appeals
, 253 SCRA 623 [1996]).

On the matter of bail, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's 
motion to post bail on the bail on the ground that the decision of the 
lower court had become final and executory, inasmuch as the petitioner's
 appeal has also been denied.

The following provision of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, as amended by Administrative Circular No. 12-94, are pertinent:



Sec. 4. 
Bail, a matter of right
. - All persons in custody 
shall: (a) before or after conviction by the Metropolitan Trial Court, 
Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities and Municipal 
Circuit Trial Court, and (b) before conviction by the Regional Trial 
Court of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua of life 
imprisonment, be admitted to bail as a matter of right, with sufficient 
sureties, or be released on recognizance as prescribed by law or this 
Rule.
  


Sec. 5. 
Bail, when discretionary
 - Upon conviction by the 
Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion 
perpetua or life imprisonment, the court, on application, may admit the 
accused to bail.
  


The court, in its discretion, may allow the accused to continue on 
provisional liberty under the same bail bond during the period of appeal
 subject to the consent of the bondsman.
  


If the court imposed a penalty of imprisonment exceeding six (6) 
years but not more than twenty (20) years, the accused shall be denied 
bail, or his bail prebe cancelled, upon a showing by the prosecution, 
with notice to the accused of the following or other similar 
circumstances:
  


(a)            That the accused is a recidivist, quasi-recidivist, 
or habitual delinquent, or has committed the crime aggravated by the 
circumstance of reiteration;
  


(b)            That the accused is found to have previously escaped
 from legal confinement, evaded sentence, or has violated the conditions
 of his bail without valid jurisdiction;
  


(c)            That the accused committed the offense while on probation, parole or under conditional pardon
  


(d)            That the circumstances of the accused or his case indicate the probability of flight if released on bail; or
  


(e)            That there is undue risk that during the pendency of the appeal, the accused may commit another crime.
  


The appellate court may review the resolution of the Regional Trial Court, on motion and with notice to the adverse party.
  




Petitioner was not convicted of an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
,
 or life imprisonment where bail is not matter of right on the part of 
petitioner nor of discretion on the part of the Court. Neither has he 
been convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment of six to twenty
 years where bail becomes a matter of judicial discretion and may be 
denied if any of the circumstances aforementioned are present. Rather, 
petitioner was convicted erroneously - it is to be hastily added - of 
offenses punishable only by imprisonment of one year each. In this 
light, petitioner's admission to bail becomes imperative and 
indispensable, moreso because of petitioner's deteriorating health.

The right to bail is a constitutional guaranty which every person
 under legal custody may invoke, except those qualified under the law. 
Petitioner does not fall under these exceptions and must, therefore, be 
duly accorded such right. Verily, it was patent error for the respondent
 Court of Appeals to deny petitioner of said right.

WHEREFORE
, the instant petition for certiorari 
is GRANTED. The decision of the Court of Appeals dated November 29, 1996
 affirming the October 30, 1996 decision of the lower court, as well as 
said latter decision, are hereby set aside, and the case is remanded to 
the court of origin for further proceedings whereat, petioner may be 
given an opportunity to post bail. For this reason, respondent court's 
resolution dated April 11, 1997 and May 19, 1997 denying petitioner's 
petition for bail are likewise set aside. No special pronouncement is 
made as to costs.

SO ORDERED.



Regalado, (Chairman), Puno, Mendoza
, and 
Martinez, JJ.
, concur.
