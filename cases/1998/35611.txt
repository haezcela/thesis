PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. RUSTUMÂ  LUZORATA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO,Â  J.:


RUSTUM LUZORATA
was charged with rape in the Regional Trial Court of Lapu-Lapu City.  He was convicted and sentenced to 
reclusion
perpetua.
  He was also ordered to
indemnify his victim 
P
30,000.00.  


We now review
his conviction.  


Maritess
Cutamora and Rustum Luzorata were neighbors in Pusok, Lapu-Lapu City, their
houses being only about 30 to 40 meters apart.  Maritess was a helper in the household of Ceferina Ibio.  


The nightmare of
Maritess began at dawn of 10 December 1990.    At around 3:00 o'clock in the
morning, Maritess who was sleeping with her face downwards suddenly felt a
heavy weight on her back.  When she
turned around she saw a man naked holding a pair of scissors.  It was the accused Rustum Luzorata.  She recognized him immediately as she had
known him for quite sometime before then and his face was illuminated by the
night light on the left side of her bed.
[1]
 Ceferina, Maritess' employer, was
out of town.


Maritess'
familiarity with Rustum did not deter him from pursuing his evil design.  He lost no time in lifting her t-shirt,
raised her skirt and took off her panties.  She tried to resist him by crossing her legs but to no avail.  She told him, "
kalain gud nimo Noy
Rustum,
"
[2]
 but the accused warned her instead
to keep quiet or he would kill her.  He
then placed himself on top of her, parted her legs and the inevitable had to
come.  He forcibly inserted his penis
into her vagina with a "push-and-pull" movement while alternately
nibbling and sucking her nipples.  After
having satisfied his lust he hurriedly put on his shorts and exited through the
same window he destroyed when he entered the house early that morning.


Her vagina bled,
ached.  She wept incessantly through the
night, heavy perhaps with the thought of her experience with the accused.  She was so disturbed that it took her a long
while to open the door when her employer arrived that morning from Bohol.  Obviously, Maritess appeared weak, weary and
exhausted,  and  her employer later noticed her
condition.  After narrating to Ceferina
what happen to her, her employer accompanied her to the Lapu-Lapu District
Hospital where she underwent physical examination.  The result showed that she suffered fresh lacerations with bleeding
and congested edges at 5:00 o'clock position.  She had abrasions on her fourchette with white vaginal discharge
indicating the presence of spermatozoa in her organ.
[3]


On 14 December
1990 Maritess Cutamora lodged her complaint agaisnt the accused Rustum Luzorata
for rape in the court 
a quo
  which
on 29 October 1991 found him guilty as charged.
[4]


The accused now
comes to us on appeal contending that -


First
.
  There is no any physical evidence showing
the use of force.  Dr. Araceli P. Yap,
the medico-legal officer of Lapu-Lapu District Hospital, Lapu-Lapu City,
admitted that she found no injuries on the victim's person when she was
examined and that, furthermore, the victim had old lacerations which she could
have obtained through previous sexual encounters.
[5]


But in rape,
force need not always produce physical injuries.
[6]
 The absence of external signs of
physical injuries and the failure of the victim to shout for help do not negate
rape.
[7]
 It  is  not  necessary  that force be
employed.  Intimidation is sufficient,
and this includes threatening the victim with a knife.
[8]
 In this case, the accused used a
pair of scissors to compel his victim to submit to his evil scheme.  In  People v. Oarga
 
we held
that intimidation was addressed to the mind of the victim and  therefore subjective,  and  its  presence  could  not  be tested by any
hard-and-fast rule but must be viewed in the light of the  victim's perception and judgment at the  time of the crime.
[9]


Second
.
  The behavior of the complainant,
particularly her  conduct immediately
after the incident, negated her claim that she was raped.


This Court
indeed has not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave
immediately after she has been abused.  This experience is relative and may be dealt with in any way by the
victim depending  on  the circumstances,  but  her  credibility  should  not  be tainted with any modicum of doubt.  Different people act differently to  a given stimulus or type of situation, and
there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a
strange or startling or frightful experience.
[10]
 In one case
[11]
 the Court held that in a
prosecution for  rape the complainant's
credibility becomes the single  most
important issue.  If her testimony meets
the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis
thereof.  Moreover, the  testimony of  a  rape  victim  is  credible  where  she  has  no  motive  to testify falsely.  Considering the inbred modesty and the
consequent  revulsion of a Filipina
against airing in public matters that affect her honor, it is hard to conceive
that complainant would reveal and admit  the ignominy she had undergone if it were not true.
[12]


Third
.
  The
complainant's delay in reporting the alleged rape to the authorities created
serious doubts.


We do not
agree.  In People v. Faigano  this Court held that it was
understandable  for the victim not to
immediately report the rape as Filipino women are known to be affectedly shy
and coy, and rape stigmatizes the victim, not the perpetrator.
[13]


Fourth
.
  The complainant did not know the identity of
the man who allegedly raped her. 


This is
puerile.  While it is true that the
complainant was lying down in a prone position and could not have seen the face
of the accused at the first instance, Maritess was able to positively identify
the accused when she turned her head to find out what it was or who he
was.  Besides, in consummating the act,
they had to assume a missionary position which enabled the accused to
consummate the rape.  The contention of
the defense that it was improbable, if not highly impossible, for the victim to
recognize a man in darkness when both her eyes were covered with tears, cannot
be  given  credence.  The
crime  scene  was  not  exactly  in  pitch  darkness  since there was a tiny bulb which illuminated the room sufficient enough
for Maritess to see and recognize the accused.


Fifth
.
  The defense would also fault the complaining
witness for not confronting the accused about the incident when they saw each
other after the incident.  


We must consider
that the victim was a 15-year old barrio lass  who only finished grade six and worked only as a househelp, obviously
too naive in the ways of the world.  One
cannot expect a girl with her status in life to cry out in public her personal
anguish, humiliation and pain.  Surely,
she should be looked upon with pity for the bestiality she went through.  Her courage failed her when she came face to
face with the accused who was threatening to snuff off her life should she
resist. 


As the trial
court observed, Maritess' innocent, straightforward and unflinching narration
of how she was molested was not at all tainted by any semblance of
untruthfulness that may open a possible avenue for suspicion that what she was
telling the court may have been coached or fabricated.
[14]


We have oftentimes
taken judicial notice of the fact that it is highly inconceivable for a young
barrio girl to fabricate a charge of defloration, undergo a medical examination
of her private parts,  subject herself
to public trial and tarnish her own and her family's honor and reputation
unless  she was motivated by a potent
desire to seek justice  for the wrong
done to her.
[15]


As regards the
testimony of Azucena Luzorata wife of the accused, suffice it to say that her
effort at an alibi for her husband merits no credence at all.  She testified that her husband Rustum was
with her when the rape was committed.  She tried to bolster this allegation with the fact that they had sex
around 1:00 a.m. and again at 3:00 a.m.  For someone who has been so physically busy the whole day, it is most
unlikely that she could still muster the strength to indulge in sexual
interlude, twice at that in a span of two hours, when she had to report for
work early the following morning.  Alibi
as a means of defense is weak when not substantiated by the testimony of a
credible witness.  Courts have always
looked upon the defense of alibi with  suspicion  and  have always received it with caution  not  only because it is  inherently  weak  and unreliable but also because it is easily fabricated.  Alibi as basis for acquittal must be
established with clear and convincing evidence.  The accused must convincingly demonstrate that it was physically
impossible for him to have been at the scene of  the crime at the time of its commission.  And, where  accused  was  positively  identified  by  the  victim herself who harbored no ill motive against the rapist, as in this
case,  the defense of alibi must fail.
[16]


Finally, the
feigned revenge plot against the accused said to be at the machinations of the
complainant's employer is preposterous being  irrelevant and immaterial.  We
should accord great weight and respect to  the findings of fact of the trial court  as  it  is  in  a  better  position  to determine questions involving credibility
having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment at the witness
stand.  We do not see  in this case any reason to overturn the  findings of the trial  court.
[17]
