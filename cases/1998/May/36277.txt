The information
filed against accused-appellants charged 


That on or about the 15th
day of November, 1992, at around 1:15 oâclock in the morning at Barangay Libas,
San Carlos City in Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating, and mutually aiding
each other, with evident premeditation, treachery, and intent to kill, did then
and there wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, with the use of high-powered
long firearm, attack and shoot Rodolfo Manzon and Mateo Manzon, killing them
instantaneously as a consequence, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of
the said victims in the amount of P ____________.


Contrary
to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
[2]


When arraigned
on June 7, 1993, accused-appellants pleaded not guilty, whereupon trial was
held.  The prosecutionâs main witnesses
were Carlito Manzon and Jordan Pagsolingan.  Carlito Manzon is a nephew of the deceased Rodolfo Manzon, Carlitoâs father
being the brother of Rodolfo Manzon.  Jordan Pagsolingan is the son of Carlito Manzonâs sister, Flora
Pagsolingan, and therefore is a grandnephew of the deceased Rodolfo Manzon.


Per their
testimonies,
[3]
 at around 11 p.m. of November 14,
1992, at a  pre-wedding dance in
Barangay Libas, San Carlos City, Rufo Manzon was beaten up by accused-appellant
Mario Padlan and a certain Lito Fernandez.  He was saved from further punishment by the timely intervention of
Carlito Manzon and Jordan Pagsolingan who took him away and led him to the
house of Flora Pagsolingan in Barangay Anando.  Carlito Manzon and Jordan Pagsolingan then went to Barangay Payar to
fetch Rufoâs father, Rodolfo Manzon.  Mateo, a brother of Rufo, came along in response.


At Sitio
Caniogon of Barangay Libas, the four saw accused-appellants Mario Padlan, Romeo
Magleo, and Alfredo Magleo.  They tried
to avoid them, but they were pursued by the three.  Romeo Magleo ordered them to stop, shouting âHoy!â at them.  Carlito and Jordan saw that Mario Padlan was
armed with a rifle.  Jordan also saw
that accused-appellant Alfredo Magleo had a knife.


Carlito and
Jordan were young boys aged 16 and 15, respectively.  Mario Padlan âwent aroundâ the two boys to get near Rodolfo
Manzon and then shot the latter.  Mario
Padlan fired three times at Rodolfo Manzon,
[4]
 as the other accused-appellants
watched.
[5]


Frightened,
Jordan Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon ran away.  As they were fleeing, Jordan Pagsolingan said he heard two more
shots fired.
[6]
 He and Carlito went home to
Barangay Anando to report the incident.  Upon learning of the incident, Jordanâs mother, Flora Pagsolingan, and
Eling Manzon lost no time and went to the city proper to report the matter to
the police.


Flora
Pagsolingan corroborated the testimonies of her son Jordan and her brother
Carlito Manzon.
[7]
 She testified that the incident was
entered in the blotter of the police.
[8]


SPO4 Alberto
Castro of the Philippine National Police in San Carlos City also testified.
[9]
 He said that upon receipt of Flora
Pagsolinganâs report, at 3:20 a.m. of November 15, 1992, a team of policemen
went to the scene of the crime and afterwards to the residence of Mario Padlan
in Barangay Libas, but was told by the latterâs wife that he did not go home
that night.  The police finally found
him at about 7 a.m., in the house of his father-in-law, Alejandro Magleo.  Magleo, a former barangay captain,
surrendered Mario Padlan to the police.  SPO4 Castro said that the report mentioning the participation of the two
other accused-appellants, Romeo and Alfredo Magleo, came only at about 5 in the
morning.
[10]


SPO Virgilio G.
CardiÃ±oza, who was a member of the team, testified that they recovered from the
scene of the crime four empty shells fired from an armalite rifle.
[11]
 Rodolfo Manzon had a short bolo
which the police found to be in its scabbard,
[12]
 while Mateo Manzon had a slingshot
with darts.
[13]
 Near the feet of Rodolfo Manzon the
police found a knife.
[14]
 SPO CardiÃ±oza said he interviewed
Jordan Pagsolingan and was told that Mario Padlan fired at them and that with
Padlan were Romeo and Alfredo Magleo.
[15]
 SPO CardiÃ±oza said that he and his
companions after sometime found Mario Padlan in the house of his father-in-law,
but they were unable to locate the other accused-appellants Romeo and Alfredo
Magleo in their residences.
[16]


Lolita Manzon,
the wife and mother of the victims, testified
[17]
 that prior to their death, Rodolfo
Manzon worked as a tenant farmer on land that produced eight cavans a year,
while her son Mateo, 15 years of age, was a high school sophomore who helped
his father farm the land.  She bought
coffins but could not remember how much she paid for them because of her shock
and grief.  The deaths of her husband
and son were for her âvery painful because there were two of them.â
[18]


Dr. Juan I.
Pizarro, who conducted the postmortem examination of the bodies of the victims,
found Rodolfo Manzon to have suffered the following wounds:


1.
Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Lacerated wound, anterior surface of left
forearm, 3 inches from the elbow, measuring 1

3.
Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Gunshot wound with point of entrance,
circular in shape, 10 mm. in diameter, located at the left epigastric area
along anterior axillary line 3 inches below the coastal line with irregular
borders penetrating the abdominal cavity with portion of the intestine
protruding outside through this wound.


Point of Exit - None.
[19]


Dr. Pizarro testified that wound no. 1 could have been caused by a
pointed instrument and wound no. 2 by a sharp-bladed instrument.  Wound no. 3 was the fatal wound, which  caused massive internal hemorrhage.
[20]


Dr. Pizarro
found Mateo Manzon to have suffered a â[g]aping incised wound 2
1
/
2
 inches
long and 1
1
/
2

 inches deep horizontally across the
anterior chest wall just below the medial end of the right clavicle lacerating
the right first rib and right portion of the sternum, directed posteriorily to
the left lacerating the lungs and the heart.â
[21]
 According to Dr. Pizarro, the
wound, which was caused by a sharp-pointed instrument, was fatal.
[22]


Accused-appellant
Alfredo Magleo admitted
[23]
 that he was at the pre-wedding
party in Barangay Libas in the evening of November 14, 1992.  He claimed, however, that he and
accused-appellant Mario Padlan and others did not leave the place until 4 a.m.
of the following day, November 15, 1992.  Alfredo said that from the party he went home  to Barangay Anando, and that in the morning, while the police
officers went to the house of his father and arrested his brother-in-law,
accused-appellant Mario Padlan, they did not arrest him (Alfredo Magleo)
despite the fact that his house was only 15 meters away.


Accused-appellants
Mario Padlan and Romeo Magleo also interposed the defense of alibi.  Padlan claimed
[24]
 that they were in the house of
Aniceto de la Cruz for the pre-wedding party for the latterâs daughter,
Evangeline de la Cruz, and Roly Domingo which lasted from 7 p.m. of November
14, 1992 up to 4 a.m. of November 15, 1992; and that after the party,
accused-appellant Romeo Magleo stayed behind, as he had been asked by Aniceto
de la Cruz to help prepare the food for the guests on the day of the wedding.


Padlan claimed
that from the party, he went to the house of his father-in-law Alejandro Magleo
because his wife was there.   It was
there that the police found him and âinvitedâ him to go with them to the police
station for questioning.  He said he
denied involvement in the killing and even asked to be given a paraffin test by
the National Bureau of Investigation, but that although he was taken to the
NBI, he could not be tested because of lack of equipment.  Padlan also testified that he had no
misunderstanding with the Pagsolingan family.


  For his part, Romeo Magleo testified
[25]
 that before he left the house of
Aniceto de la Cruz (where the party was held) at 8:30 a.m. of November 15,
1992, Flora Pagsolingan arrived with some policemen and asked if any untoward
incident had happened during the celebration, to which Romeo Magleo said he
answered in the negative; and that he (Romeo Magleo) was not apprehended by the
police officers.


Aniceto de la
Cruz, in whose house the party was held, testified that none of the
accused-appellants had left the party before it ended at 4 a.m. of  November 15, 1992.
[26]


The defense also
presented as witnesses three farmers, Rodolfo Lavarias, Tomas Lavarias, and
Ernesto Lavarias, all of whom were residents of Barangay Anando.  Ernesto Lavarias testified
[27]
 that at around midnight of November
14, 1992, he heard cries coming from the house of Flora Pagsolingan less than
30 meters away.  For this reason, he
said, he fetched his brother Tomas and the two of them then went to Floraâs
house.  There they learned that Rufo
Manzon had been beaten up.  Rufo was
brought to the house of Flora.  According to Ernesto Lavarias, Flora Pagsolingan sent her son Jordan
Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon to fetch Rufoâs parents.  In no time, Jordan and Lito were back with
news that Rufoâs parents were coming.


On rebuttal,
Flora Pagsolingan testified
[28]
 that actually Ernesto and Tomas Lavarias
went to her house only at about 1:15 in the morning of November 15, 1992, and
that was because of the news that Rodolfo Manzon had been shot.


The trial court
found accused-appellants guilty as charged in its decision, the dispositive
portion of which was quoted earlier herein.  Hence, this appeal.  Accused-appellants contend:


I.


THE LOWER
COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION SUBSTANTIALLY
INSUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH THE GUILT OF THE HEREIN ACCUSED-APPELLANTS BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT IN THE CASE AT BAR.


II.


THE LOWER
COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING WEIGHT TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE HEREIN
ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.


The contentions
are without merit.


First.
  Accused-appellants were positively identified by prosecution witnesses
Jordan Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon as the ones who had stopped them on the
way on the day of the incident.  While
accused-appellants claimed they were in the house of Aniceto de la Cruz
attending a pre-wedding party, their alibi cannot prevail over the testimonies
of the prosecution witnesses positively identifying them as the
assailants.  The place where
accused-appellants were at the time of the killing is in Barangay Libas where
the crime also took place.  It was not
at all physically impossible for them to have committed the crime.
[29]
 Each of the accused-appellants
claimed he had no quarrel with the deceased or the prosecutionâs main
witnesses.  Their identification,
however, makes it irrelevant that there is no proof of ill motive on their part
to commit the crime.  Motive assumes
significance only where there is no showing of who the perpetrators of the
crimes were.
[30]


It is contended
that the testimonies of the two prosecution eyewitnesses, Carlito Manzon and
Jordan Pagsolingan, are at odds with the entry in the police blotter.  Accused-appellants Romeo and Alfredo Magleo
contend that entry in the police blotter does not name them as among those
involved in the killing of Rodolfo Manzon and his son Mateo.


The entry reads:


FIRST, SECOND & THIRD
SHIFT:  0800h-0800h 14-15 NOVEMBER 1992.


Entry Nr-496


Date:  11-15-92


Time:

school graduate, and resident of Brgy. Anando, this city came and reported to
this office that Rodolfo Manzon and Mateo Manzon, Carlito Manzon and Jordan
Pagsolingan were fired upon 
by Marcos Pagsolingan in company w/ two other
whom they do not know their names
.  Reportee further reported that they do not  know  whether  Mateo Manzon and Rodolfo Manzon were
hit.  Incident happened at about 1:15

  Desk Officer
[31]


Flora
Pagsolingan explained that at the time she made the report, she was âin [a]
state of shock ... confused, and did not know what [she] was doing.â
[32]
 She must have been in such a state
of agitation that even the police investigator, who took down her statement,
identified accused-appellant Mario âMarcosâ Padlan as âMarcos Pagsolingan,â
although Flora maintains she never said the assailant was âMarcosâ
Pagsolingan.  As she testified:


COURT:


Q
Â Â Â Â  
Now, in this police blotter, it was entered
by the police, which you also confirmed, that it was Marcos Pagsolingan who
fired his gun?


A
Â Â Â Â  
What I said was Marcos Padlan, sir.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
So, in other words, this entry in this
police blotter is not accurate?


A
Â Â Â Â  
I said Marcos Padlan, your Honor, and I did
not put so much attention on the two because my mind was confused.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
In other words, you confirmed the fact that
your son Jordan Pagsolingan and this Carlito Manzon told you that it was Marcos
Padlan who fired his gun at Rodolfo Manzon and Mateo Manzon?


A
Â Â Â Â  
It was what they were telling me, sir.
[33]


Accused-appellants
contend that Floraâs son, Jordan, and Carlito Manzon could have corrected her or
otherwise helped her since the two boys were with her when she gave her
statement to the police.  But the two
boys said they were themselves agitated if not in shock as well as in fear
[34]
 and so possibly could not have
corrected Floraâs mistakes.


Accused-appellants
cite the testimony of SPO4 Alberto Castro which allegedly corroborates the
blotter entry naming accused-appellant Mario Padlan as the only assailant.  That is not so.  SPO4 Castroâs testimony is as follows:


Q
Â Â Â Â  
Aside from Marcos Padlan, did [Jordan
Pagsolingan] also mention others?


A
Â Â Â Â  
Actually, 
at the crime scene
 when we
conducted an investigation, Flora Pagsolingan and her son were only mentioning
Marcos Padlan, sir.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
Now, what time did you receive that report
from Flora Pagsolingan on November 15, 1992?


A
Â Â Â Â  
If I am not mistaken, before 5:00 oâclock,
sir.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
5:00 oâclock in the morning?


A
Â Â Â Â  
Yes, sir.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
And you immediately formed a team and
investigated the veracity of the report, can you tell us further what time more
or less did you go to the place of the incident?


A
Â Â Â Â  
3:20 oâclock in the morning of  November 15, sir.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
So that, do we understand from you senior
police officer that the report was made at 5:00 oâclock in the  morning of November 15?


A
Â Â Â Â  
No, sir, what I mean, I am referring to the
other  accused that if I am not
mistaken, there were three (3) accused in this particular case.  
We received a report only at about 5:00
oâclock in the morning mentioning the two (2) accused
.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
Who were the two (2) accused
?


A
Â Â Â Â  
Magleo brothers, sir
.


Q
Â Â Â Â  
In what manner are they accused of?


A
Â Â Â Â  
In the first place, this Flora Pagsolingan
and her son only mentioned Marcos Padlan, so, we concentrated on Marcos Padlan,

we invited him to the police station, sir
.
[35]


Thus what SPO4
Castro said was that while in the beginning only accused-appellant Mario Padlan
was named by Flora Pagsolingan and her son Jordan, the police later received a
report at 5 a.m. that accused-appellants Romeo Magleo and Alfredo (Boy) Magleo
were also involved in the killing of Rodolfo Manzon and his son Mateo.  In fact, according to the police blotter,
Rodolfo Manzon, his son Mateo, Carlito Manzon, and Jordan Pagsolingan were
fired at by Mario âMarcosâ Padlan (erroneously identified therein as âMarcos
Pagsolinganâ) and two unidentified men.  Another member of the police team, SPO Virgilio G. CardiÃ±oza, also
testified that, during their investigation at the scene of the crime, Jordan
Pagsolingan named the two Magleos as the companions of Mario Padlan.
[36]


It is not
surprising that attention should focus on Mario Padlan because he was the one
seen by Jordan Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon shooting Rodolfo Manzon.  In the process, the participation of the
other two as coconspirators was obscured.  But when it came to their turn to make their sworn statements and later
to testify in court, Jordan Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon categorically stated
that the Magleo brothers were present at the shooting.


Moreover, it
should not be forgotten that entries in police blotters, though regularly done
in the course of the performance of official duty, are not conclusive proof of
the truth stated in such entries and should not be given undue significance or
probative value because they are usually incomplete and inaccurate.  Sometimes they are based on partial
suggestion or inaccurate reporting and hearsay, untested in the crucible of a
trial on the merits.
[37]
 But an indication of the guilt of
the Magleos is the fact that shortly after the killing they went into
hiding.  They could not be found in their
respective residences for which reason an alias warrant had to be issued by the
trial court for their arrest.  Flight
has been held to be evidence of guilt.
[38]


Second.  
Accused-appellants focus on the credibility of the
prosecution witnesses.  Accused-appellants
point out a discrepancy between Jordan Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzonâs
testimonies to the effect that they were with Rufo Manzon when the latter was
attacked by Mario Padlan and Lito Fernandez and their affidavits
[39]
 in which they stated that they were
on their way to the pre-wedding dance party when they came upon Rufo Manzon
being beaten up.  There really appears
to be a discrepancy concerning this matter.  However, it is not denied that Rufo Manzon had been beaten up by Mario
Padlan and Lito Fernandez, and this was the reason his father, the deceased
Rodolfo Manzon, was summoned.  Whether
Rufo Manzon was with Carlito Manzon and Jordan Pagsolingan when he was set upon
or whether he was then alone is therefore of little moment.


Accused-appellants
point out other âdiscrepanciesâ in the evidence of the prosecution.  Accused-appellants cite Jordan Pagsolinganâs
testimony that accused-appellant Mario Padlan fired three times at Rodolfo
Manzon and that, as he and Carlito Manzon were fleeing, he heard two more
gunshots, so that in all accused-appellant fired at the victims five times.


Accused-appellants say that this is contrary to the evidence that
Rodolfo Manzon sustained only one gunshot wound.


The number of
wounds does not have to be equal to the number of shots, because some of the
shots may have missed their mark.  It is
also possible that in the excitement of the moment, Jordan Pagsolingan may have
made a mistake as to the  number of
shots he heard.  What is important is
that although Rodolfo Manzon suffered only one gunshot wound, the fact is that
the police recovered four empty shells from the scene of the crime.  This confirms the statement of Jordan
Pagsolingan that several gunshots had been fired by accused-appellant Mario
Padlan.


Accused-appellants
claim that had it been their intention to kill the victims, they could easily
have ambushed the victims instead of openly confronting them, considering that
they are known to the witnesses and the victims.  This assumes that accused-appellants knew that the Manzons were
going to pass the place where they were so as to enable them to waylay their
victims.  The fact, however, is that it
was the Manzons who saw accused-appellants at a distance and who tried to run
away from them, but accused-appellants, using a shortcut, were able to overtake
the Manzons.


Accused-appellants
doubt whether the prosecution witnesses really recognized them.  Accused-appellants argue that if Mario
Padlan trained his flashlight on the group of the eyewitnesses and the Manzons,
the prosecution witnesses would not have recognized accused-appellants.  As Jordan Pagsolingan explained, however, it
was quite bright that early morning because there was a moon and
accused-appellants were known to them because âwe usually joke together.â
[40]
 Carlito Manzon also testified that
the moon was bright at that time.
[41]


Finally,
accused-appellants brand the prosecution evidence as fabricated because of the
close relationship of the prosecutionâs main witnesses to the victims.  In the absence of proof of improper motive,
the mere relationship of the prosecution witnesses to the victims is not a
ground for doubting their truthfulness.  On the contrary, their natural interest to secure the conviction of the
real culprits could have deterred them from implicating otherwise innocent
persons, for then the real culprits would go scot free.
[42]
 In this case, there is additional
reason for rejecting accused-appellantsâ contention that because of their
relationship to the deceased the prosecution witnesses concocted stories to lay
the blame for the killing on accused-appellants: accused-appellants admitted
that they had no quarrel or misunderstanding with the Pagsolingan family which
could make Jordan Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon testify falsely against them.


The various
criticisms made by accused-appellants against the testimonies of Jordan
Pagsolingan and Carlito Manzon boil down to a question of their
credibility.  The trial court, which was
in the unique position to hear the witnesses and observe their deportment and
manner of testifying, believed their testimonies.
[43]
 We have considered the contrary
view of accused-appellants which we find to be without merit.  Accused-appellants have not shown that, in
the evaluation of the testimonies of the witnesses for both parties, the trial
court overlooked matters of substance and weight justifying reversal of the
findings of the trial court.
[44]
 Accordingly, we give its findings
full faith and credit.


Third
.  Accused-appellants claim that even if all of them were present at the scene
of the crime, no inference of conspiracy can be drawn since the two prosecution
eyewitnesses did not see Romeo and Alfredo Magleo attack the victims.  Several circumstances indicate, however,
that there was a conspiracy to kill Rodolfo Manzon and his son, Mateo, in
addition to the fact that all of  accused-appellants were at the scene of the crime,  to wit: (1) accused-appellant Romeo Magleo
shouted âHoy!â at the Manzons to make them stop as the latter were running
away; (2) accused-appellants pursued the Manzons when the latter tried to flee
from them; and (3) accused-appellant Alfredo Magleo was seen by Jordan
Pagsolingan  with a knife, which fits
the description of the weapon used in wounding Rodolfo Manzon and Mateo Manzon:
âpointedâ and âsharp-bladed.â
[45]


Nevertheless, we
do not think that the crime committed was murder.  The qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation and
treachery have not been shown in this case.  Proof of conspiracy does not imply the existence of evident
premeditation.  Evident premeditation
can be presumed only where conspiracy is directly established, not where, as in
this case, conspiracy is only implied.
[46]
 Nor was treachery established with
certainty.
[47]
 The prosecution has not shown that
there was that swift and unexpected attack of an unarmed victim, which is the
essence of treachery.
[48]
 First, the victims were not
defenseless, since they too were armed.  Rodolfo had a bolo, while Mateo had a slingshot with darts.  Second, the sight of accused-appellants at a
distance must have sufficiently warned the Manzons of accused-appellants and
their  intentions; that was why they
tried to evade them.  Thus, an important
condition for the existence of treachery under Art. 14(16) of the Revised Penal
Code has not been proven:  that the
means of execution employed was deliberately and consciously adopted so as to
give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate.  Accordingly, the killing of Rodolfo Manzon
and his son Mateo constitutes not murder but only homicide.


The trial court
found that the killing was attended by the aggravating circumstances of (1)
abuse of superior strength, (2) aid of armed men, and (3) nocturnity.  Indeed, there was abuse of superior strength
in this case.  Whatever superiority in
number the victims had over accused-appellants (four to three) was more than
offset by the fact that the latter group was composed of adult males in their
physical prime.  Accused-appellant Mario
Padlan was 28,
[49]
 while accused-appellants Romeo and
Alfredo Magleo were 26
[50]
 and 32,
[51]
 respectively.  In contrast, the former group, with the sole
exception of Rodolfo Manzon, who was 43,
[52]
 was composed of youths barely in
their early teens.  Mateo Manzon and
Jordan Pagsolingan were both 15 years old,
[53]
 while Carlito Manzon was 16 years
of age.
[54]
 More importantly, the group of
accused-appellants had a firearm and a knife which gave them a clear advantage
over the bolo and slingshot of the victims.


But we do not
think the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity can be appreciated as
nocturnity was not shown to have been purposely sought by accused-appellants
the better to commit the crime.
[55]
 Nor can the aggravating
circumstance of âaid of armed menâ be appreciated, considering that accused-appellants,
as coconspirators, acted under the same plan and for the same purpose.
[56]


Under Art. 249
of the Revised Penal Code the penalty for homicide is 
reclusion
temporal.  
As there was one
aggravating circumstance (abuse of superior strength), the penalty should be
fixed in its maximum period, the duration of which  is  from 17 years, 4
months, and 1 day to 20 years.  Under
the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum of the penalty is 
prision mayor,

which is from  6 years and 1 day to 12
years, as the penalty next lower in degree to 
reclusion temporal
. 


In addition, we
find errors committed by the trial court in awarding damages for the death of
Rodolfo Manzon and his son Mateo.  The
indemnity for death as currently fixed
[57]
 is 
P
50,000.00 so the trial
courtâs award of 
P
60,000.00 for the death of Rodolfo Manzon should be
reduced accordingly.


The award of 
P
100,000.00
for actual and temperate damages cannot be allowed.  Damages cannot be both actual and temperate.  Temperate or moderate damages are allowed
because, while some pecuniary loss has been suffered, from the nature of the
case its amount cannot be proved with certainty.
[58]
 This is not the case here.  The trial court awarded the 
P
100,000.00
as temperate damages apparently because the prosecution failed to adduce proof
of expenses in connection with the death, wake, or burial of Rodolfo and Mateo
Manzon but not because from the nature of the case it was not possible to show
with certainty the amount of the damage done.  For the same reason, no award of actual damages can be made.
[59]


The award of 
P
200,000.00
for moral damages is  excessive.  As moral damages are not intended to enrich
the prevailing party,
[60]
 an award of 
P
50,000.00 would
be in keeping with this purpose of the law.


The award of
exemplary damages is warranted under Art. 2230 of the Civil Code in view of the
presence of the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength.  Imposition of exemplary damages is also
justified under Art. 2229 of the Civil Code in order to set an example for the
public good.  For this purpose, we
believe that the amount of P20,000.00 can be appropriately awarded.
[61]
 In reviewing the records of this
case, we noticed a variance between the allegation in the information and the
evidence presented regarding the manner in which Mateo Manzon was killed.  The information alleged that he and his
father Rodolfo Manzon were killed âwith the use of high-powered long firearm,â
but the medical certificate indicates that while Rodolfo Manzon suffered both
incised and lacerated wounds as well as a gunshot wound, his son Mateo suffered
only a â[g]aping incised wound 2
1
/
2
 inches long and 1
1
/
2
 inches
wide and 5
1
/
2
 inches deep horizontally across the anterior chest wall
just below the medial end of the right clavicle lacerating the right first rib
and right portion of the sternum, directed posteriorily to the left lacerating
the lungs and the heart.â  The variance,
however, is not an obstacle to finding the accused-appellants liable for double
homicide.  The variance does not affect
or change the nature of the crime charged, namely, murder, which in view of our
finding is actually homicide.  The
variance concerns merely the manner of execution of the crime.  The defense could have objected to the
presentation of the evidence, in which event the court could have ordered the
amendment of the information so as to make the allegation conform to the
evidence presented and the accused-appellants would be none the worse for
it.  Accordingly, we hold that
accused-appellants are liable for two counts of homicide.


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial
Court is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the accused-appellants are found
guilty of two counts of homicide and each one is sentenced to two prison terms
of 12 years of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to 20 years of 
reclusion
temporal
, as maximum, and to pay to the heirs of the victims 
P
50,000.00
as indemnity for the death of Rodolfo Manzon, 
P
50,000.00 as indemnity
for the death of Mateo Manzon, 
P
50,000.00 as moral damages, and 
P
20,000.00
as exemplary damages.
