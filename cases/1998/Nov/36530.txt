KAPUNAN, J.:


Before
 us is a petition for 
certiorari

under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the
decision of the NLRC dated  31 January
1995 which affirmed the decision of Labor Arbiter Manuel R. Caday dated 
23
September 1994 dismissing petitionerâs complaint for illegal dismissal 
and
damages. Similarly impugned is the NLRCâs resolution dated 20 April 1995
denying the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner.


The facts are:


On 16 March 1989, the 
Hotel Nikko
Manila Garden (Nikko for brevity), a corporation duly organized and 
existing
under Philippine laws and primarily engaged in the hotel and restaurant
business, employed petitioner Antonio Habana as Rooms Division Director.


Then General Manager 
Masakazu
Tsuruoka issued the following inter-department memorandum announcing
petitionerâs appointment, detailing his experiences in the hotel 
business.  He expressed full support for petitionerâs
capability to improve and develop the services and facilities of the 
Rooms
Division.  The pertinent portion of the
memorandum reads:

:  
MR. ANTONIO
 R. HABANA, ROOMS 
DIVISION
 DIRECTOR


DATE
         
:  March 15, 
1989


I am pleased to announce the appointment of MR. ANTONIO R. 
HABANA
to the position of Rooms Division Director effective March 16, 1989.


Mr. Habana joins Manila Garden Hotel backed by 20 years 
experience
in the hotel industry.  He worked with
Manila Hilton, Guam Hilton and Hyatt Regency Manila in various 
managerial
capacities.  His recent employments
were with Manila Hotel as Operations Analyst for 10 years up to June 
1986, and
with Penta Hotel in Manhattan, New York as Night Manager.  From 1986 to 
early 1989, he was president
of a travel/tour company in New York.


Mr. Habana is a BSBA Management graduate of  Dela Salle 
University, and a BSBA Accounting
graduate of the University of the East.


I ask every one to welcome and extend full support and 
cooperation
to Mr. Habana to enable him to upgrade the services and facilities of 
the
Division.


(SGD.)
MASAKAZU TSURUOKA
[1]


As Rooms Division 
Director,
petitioner was tasked with the management  and supervision of the âFront
 Office, GRO, Concierge, Reservations,
Roomskeeping, Housekeeping and Telephone Exchange to ensure high 
standard of
service.â
 
[2]
In particular, his duties were:


1.
 
Formulates plans,
projects, policies, system/procedures and  new approaches in the 
management of all departments under Rooms and
supervises the implementation of the same if determined feasible.


2.
 
Conducts regular and
surprise inspection of all work areas to ensure quality of  performance.
 Formulates/implement operations
improvement measures for Rooms Division.


3.
 
Prepares divisional
objectives and budget and implementation of  the same.


4.
 
Oversees the proper
implementation of established Standard Operating procedures in Front 
Office
operations, Reservations, public areas, guest floors and offices.


5.
 
Ensures effective and
efficient handling and processing of  FITS, group booking and 
convention.


6.
 
Upgrades the guest rooms
and services offered therein, the laundry service and cleanliness and
maintenance of public/service and garden areas for a more effective and
efficient Housekeeping operations.


7.
 
Oversees the efficient and
high quality Housekeeping of guest rooms, suites, service areas at guest
floors.


8.
 
Oversees the proper
handling of hotel telephone systems and switchboard operation to ensure 
good
communication service.


9.
 
Performs
other
 duties that the General Manager/Assistant General Manager may assign 
from
time to time.
[3]


On 31 May 1989, upon the 
request
of  top management,  petitioner submitted a âReport on Rooms
Divisionâs Operationâ to Mr.  Tsuruoka
wherein he identified the problem areas under his responsibility and
concommitantly discussed the improvements that had been accomplished and
programs he had initiated in line with Hotel Nikkoâs aim to upgrade âthe
standard of service and hotel facilities to ensure guest satisfaction.â
[4]
 These included open dialogues among the 
department
heads, modification of duties for easy determination of accountability,
training program for Assistant Department Heads to prevent disruption of
operations in absence of the Department Heads and various repairs and
refurbishments of guest rooms and public area facilities.
[5]


In the course of his 
employment,
however, petitioner encountered several difficulties, among which  was 
his failure to unite and control his
managerial staff.  In particular, petitioner
had several conflicts with his Senior Rooms Manager, Dolores Samson.  On
 9 January 1990, he issued a memorandum
admonishing her for her failure to comply with the standard operating 
procedure
of informing petitioner, being her immediate supervisor, of matters 
pertaining
to their divisionâs operations.  Petitioner reminded Samson that it was 
her  responsibility to advise and inform him of all memoranda,
reports, problems and other matters relative to their operations  which 
come to her attention.
[6]
 Similarly, in a special meeting called on 24 
January
1990,  petitioner  reiterated that âmeetings/ discussions and
instructions/decisions should not be done by  (Samson) unless cleared 
with (him),â
 
[7]
due to the âconfusions regarding (the) 
implementation
of instructions coming from the Rooms Division office.â
[8]


Thereafter, on  22 March 
1990, then Assistant General
Manager Masao Yokoo issued a memorandum expressing concern over the 
dispute
between petitioner and his managerial staff in the Rooms Division.  Mr. 
Yokoo stressed the importance of good
teamwork and urged petitioner to take responsibility for the âunhealthy
situationâ and to immediately carry out corrective measures.  Otherwise,
 management may be compelled to
intervene and take action.  The
memorandum reads in full:

I would like you to realize that management is very much 
concerned
with the conflicts involving yourself and your managerial staff within 
Rooms
Division.  This may be the first time
we are calling your attention through this manner, but management has 
been
aware for quite some time of the disunity and disharmony that has 
remained
unresolved inspite of the several  attempts management has initiated for
 you to have person-to-person
dialogues with your managers, inasmuch as management wants you, as 
Director for
Rooms Division, to take responsibility for the existence of such an 
unhealthy
situation.


We strongly believe that 
good teamwork
 coupled with 
high
respect for each otherâs potentiality and creativity within your area of
responsibility is essential to motivate efficiency and improve 
self-esteem of
your staff,  as we consider it of vital
importance for operations and should be given the highest priority at 
this
instance.


As a result, management has decided to give you due process 
to carry
out managementâs perception through instant corrective measures, or 
management
would be compelled to act or intervene directly and irrevocably.


(Sgd)  MASAO YOKOO


Assistant General Manager
[9]


Instead of complying, 
petitioner
issued a reply belying the existence of any conflict within the Rooms 
Division.
He explained that the misunderstanding was only between himself and his
assistant Dolores Samson which arose when he reprimanded her for 
violating the
hotelâs SOPs.  Petitioner stated that
the aforequoted memorandum should have been addressed to Ms.  Samson.  
He suggested that  âbetter result
will be attained if you (Yokoo) call the attention of those 
uncooperative with
their supervisor whose intention is to achieve a systematic and orderly
operation of his division such as mine . . . .â
[10]
 He further stated that he had tried to solve 
the
conflict following the applicable disciplinary actions but âthe only way
 to
make it effective to Ms. Samson is when management make(s) her realize 
that her
improper behavior is to the detriment of the operation.â
[11]


Aside from the 
afore-discussed
conflict, the Labor Arbiter found that petitioner was engaged in real 
estate
business, was frequently absent and tardy and  that there were rampant 
violations of hotel rules due to petitionerâs
failure to effectively manage his division.  For instance, an employee 
with an approved room discounts for only one
night (August 13, 1989) was allowed to change the reservation to August 
17 and
extend their stay availing of the discounted rate up to August 21 1989. 
 There were also complaints  regarding wrong key issuances and double
check-in of guests in one room.  In addition,
the rooms in the hotel were often found dirty and unkempt.
[12]


As a result thereof on 24
 April
1990, Mr. Tamiyasu Okawa who was appointed on 26 March 1990, as 
Executive
Assistant for Sales, Marketing and Rooms and replaced Mr. Yokoo as 
petitionerâs
immediate superior, issued a memorandum instructing petitioner, Ms. 
Vicky
Raquepo (Roomskeeping Manager) and Mr. Danilo Cabaluna (Housekeeping 
Manager)
to conduct a daily inspection of the guestrooms and the public areas, 
due to
the several complaints received by management.  The full text of the 
memorandum is hereby reproduced:

On 27 April 1990, petitioner sent a memorandum of protest  
to Mr. Okawa alleging that the latterâs order  for petitioner  to 
inspect the hotelâs guestrooms and public areas from 9:00 a.m.
to 6:30 p.m. left him no time to perform his other functions and thus
effectively stripping him of his powers and responsibilities without
justification.  He declared that the
above order was a form of harassment to âease him out of his position.â 
 In the said memorandum, petitioner
illustrated in detail the other forms of alleged harassment perpetuated
supposedly  by Mr. Okawa, like the
transfer of petitioner to a smaller office;  the removal of petitionerâs
 name as one of the approving officers in the
personnel forms;  and the exclusion of
petitioner from regular meetings regarding Rooms Division operations:

Recently, you stripped me of my powers and responsibilities,
without case (sic) and justification and relegated me to the job of 
inspecting
rooms and public area.  Thus, in your
Memorandum of April 24, 1990, you instructed me to do the above job from
 9:00
a.m. to 6:30 p.m., thereby preventing me from performing my other 
functions
such as attending meetings, managing the activities at the Front Office,
Reservations, Telephone Departments as well as attending to matters 
affecting
the overall operation of my area of responsibility.  This strongly 
confirms the fact that you are exerting best
efforts to harass me and ease me out of my position, as can be gleaned 
from the
following:


1.
         
On April 16, 1990, while I was on sick
leave, you caused my office/things to be transferred to a smaller room 
which is
a passageway going to SLZAâs office.  This caused me great shame and 
embarrassment;


2.
         
For some time now, you have been conducting
meetings with my staff without inviting me although matters discussed 
therein
involved the  operation of my
division.  Thus, I was left out in the
cold as to matters concerning my own division;


3.
         
Last Friday, April 20, 1990, you
informed me that you can easily ease me out of my job by just effecting a
reorganization of my division;


4.
         
One time upon seeing a request from PHI
particularly addressed to me for me to review a contract, you took said 
request
and directly acted on it without informing me thereof, inspite of the 
fact that
I was in my office at that time.


5.
         
Last April 24, 1990, you particularly
instructed me not to attend a very important seminar intended for all 
Directors
and Managers, and instead ordered me to do routine room inspection.   I 
was the only director who was not allowed
to attend this seminar, to my great embarrassment;


6.
         
When I issued a memorandum to a
subordinate who had repeatedly failed to follow the hotelâs SOPs, you
reprimanded me and instructed me not to send out memos anymore.  When I 
tried to explain, you shouted at me
and ordered me to resign.  I would
like to make it of record that I have no plans to resign because I have 
not
done anything which warrants me to do so.  I will try to do my job to 
the best of my ability despite that fact that
you have been persistently making my working conditions unbearable in 
order to
force me to resign;


7.
         
During the past weeks, before your memo
for my daily inspection dated April 24, 1990, whenever I would go  to my
 office so that I can review some
documents or otherwise work out some plans for the different departments
 under
my division, you would always send me out and require me to do some more
  inspection work.


8.
         
You instructed our secretaries not to
include my name as signatory to Personnel Forms such as Employees Status
 Form
and Misconduct Notice prepared for Rooms Division, which means that my
authority to approve the same has  likewise been removed from me.  This 
again curtailed my authority as a Division Director.


9.
         
In several occasions you have been very
rude, sarcastic and discourteous.  I
cannot be denied that you have shouted and insulted me even in the 
presence of
my staff.  But even if my self respect
is agitated, I cannot openly question your manner being my superior.


The above acts have caused me serious anxiety.  Hence,  with
 respect, this is to call your attention of the abovementioned to
respect my rights as an employee and dignity as a human.


Thank you.

However, on 2 May 1990, 
petitioner
went to the Hotelâs Comptroller, Mr. Ernesto Rosales asking for his 
severance
pay of P120,000.00 plus accrued benefits  in the amount of  P11,865.28, 
for
a total of  P131,865.28. The check was
prepared but before it was released,  petitioner was asked to submit a 
letter of resignation pursuant to hotel
policy.  Petitioner dictated the
contents of his resignation letter to Mr. Rosalesâ secretary who 
prepared the
same. After the letter was finished, petitioner signed it and submitted 
it to
Mr. Rosales who, in turn, gave the  check to petitioner.
 
[15]
Petitionerâs resignation letter reads as 
follows:


May 02, 1990


Hotel Nikko Manila
Garden


Makati, Metro Manila


Attention:  Personnel
Department


Gentlemen:


I hereby tender my resignation effective the close of 
business hour
of May 15, 1990 and I wish to thank the management and staff for having 
worked
with them for the past year.


Very truly yours,


(SGD.)  ANTONIO HABANA


  Rooms Division Director
[16]


Petitioner,
likewise,
 executed an Affidavit of  Quitclaim in favor of Hotel Nikko.


The next day, 3 May 1990,
respondents received a letter from petitioner (addressed to Mr. Okawa) 
who
insisted that he was forced to resign because he could no longer endure 
Mr.
Okawaâs acts of harassment against him.  The letter reads in full:


MR. TAMIYASU OKAWA


Executive Assistant for


Sales and Rooms


Hotel Nikko Manila Garden


Makati, Metro Manila


Dear Mr. Okawa,


I resigned because I could no longer endure your 
harassments.  Yesterday, May 2, 1990, when I explained to
you that the reason for my absence last April 28 and 30, 1990 was due to
 fever,
you told me that I was sick here (pointing to your head).  This was just
 another instance among the
other several acts of harassment which you maliciously performed in 
order to
force me to resign.  With the things
you have done which subjected me to humiliation and embarassment, they 
only
decent thing to do was to resign.


I was likewise forced to receive the money offered to me, in
 order
to have money to spend during the days I am out of work.


Thank you.


(SGD.)  ANTONIO R.  HABANA
[17]


Consequently, on 17 May 
1990,
petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and damages against 
Hotel
Nikko and its officers Masakasu Tsuruoka, Masao Yokoo and Tamiyasu 
Okawa.


On 23 September 1994, 
Labor
Arbiter Manuel R. Caday dismissed the complaint.  He ruled that when 
petitioner sensed that the hotelâs top
management has lost its confidence in his ability to effectively manage 
the Rooms
Division, he offered to voluntarily resign  in exchange for a large 
amount of separation pay.  Labor Arbiter Caday further declared that
the alleged acts of harassment were non-existent, being merely the
âself-serving imaginations conceptualized by complainant who for 
boasting too
much of his alleged twenty (20) years know-how in hotel operations, 
could not
swallow his pride and accept his being constantly reminded, reproached 
and
reprimanded by his disciplinarian new superior officer, respondent 
Okawa, for
his failing ability to effectively manage and control his own Division.â
[18]


The dispositive portion 
of the
above decision states as follows:


WHEREFORE, premises all considered, judgment is hereby 
rendered
dismissing the instant case for utter lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.
[19]


On appeal to the NLRC, 
the latter
rendered a decision on 31 January 1995 affirming the findings of  Labor 
Arbiter Caday.  The NLRC ruled that the âalleged
harassmentsâ  were  ânothing more than resentment to (the) high
and strict standards of work and personal grudge or animosity towards a
superior.â
[20]
 Likewise, the NLRC maintained that petitioner
voluntarily resigned as manifested by his act of negotiating for a huge 
amount
of separation pay.  Hence, the
dispositive portion of the NLRC decision reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated 23
September  1994 is hereby AFFIRMED and
the appeal of complainant is DISMISSED for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.
[21]


When his motion for
reconsideration was denied in the Resolution of the NLRC dated 20 April 
1998,
petitioner came to this Court stating the following grounds for his 
petition
for 
certiorari
:


I


PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN 
CONCLUDING THAT
PETITIONER HAD VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED FROM EMPLOYMENT.


II


PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY 
ABUSED ITS
DISCRETION IN NOT AWARDING DAMAGES TO PETITIONER.
[22]


The petition is without 
merit.


Evidently, the issues 
raised in
this case are factual in nature and firm is the principle that âfactual
findings of the NLRC, particularly when they coincide with those of the 
Labor
Arbiter, are accorded respect, even finality, and will not be disturbed 
for as
long as such findings are supported by substantial evidence.â
[23]


We have painstakingly 
reviewed the
records of this case and we find no justifiable reason to overturn the
findings  of  both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC.


Petitioner accuses the 
hotelâs top
brass of deliberately  committing acts
of harassment which were intended to and eventually succeeded in forcing
 him to
resign.


Petitioner laments that 
he was
completely stripped of his  powers and
functions as Director of the Rooms Division when Mr. Okawa, Executive 
Assistant
for Sales, Marketing and Rooms and petitionerâs immediate superior,  
tasked him with inspecting the hotelâs guest
rooms and public areas.  Conducting
these daily inspections, he adds, took up all of his working hours 
leaving him
no time to attend to his other important duties.  Hence,  âthe very 
essence
and substance of his directorshipâ was taken away from him.  He was, in 
effect, demoted to a mere room
inspector âwith a rank a notch higher than a bellboy.â  Moreover, 
petitioner could no longer endure
the humiliation and indignity of going from room to room, inspecting  
the toilets and garbage areas, âclad in his
standard formal suit  and tieâ  and  concludes that this  was part of
a malicious scheme to âharassâ  him out
of his position.


We are not convinced.


The instructions for 
petitioner,
along with the Executive Housekeeper (Danilo Cabaluna) and the Executive
Roomskeeper (Victoria Raquepo) to conduct daily inspection of the guest 
rooms
and public areas of the hotel could hardly be characterized  as  
harassment.  The orders were not
borne out of mere whim and caprice.  As
explicitly stated in the Memorandum dated 24 April 1990, the management 
was
getting several complaints regarding the hotelâs guestrooms and public 
areas
[24]
 and petitioner did not dispute this.  In 
fact, he testified  as follows:


x  x x.


ATTY. BAUSA:


We will go back to that letter on Mr.
Habana, we will quote to you the next complaint which is the alleged 
inspection
of rooms.  As the Rooms Division
Director, it is one of  your duties to
inspect the rooms, is it not?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY.  BAUSA:


As  a
matter of fact, it is one of the duties enumerated in your Job
Description?  Is that correct?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. BAUSA:


More specifically, it is contained in item
No. 2 in the enumeration of your Job description  contained in your 
affidavit?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. BAUSA:


You will agree with us Mr. Habana, that the
rooms and public area of a five (5) star hotel should not only be clean 
and
tidy, it would be impeccable also, is that correct?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. BAUSA:


And seeing to it that this (sic) rooms were
in that impeccable condition, are critical and crucial part of your job,
 is
that correct?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. BAUSA:


During this time that you complaint of
which is also mentioned in your affidavit, it is not a fact that there 
were several
complaints from the public about the condition of the rooms as well as 
the
public area.


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. BAUSA:


Is it for this reason that . . . the
improvement and the maintenance of this rooms condition were imperative?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


x x x
[25]
.


From the aforequoted
testimony  petitioner, likewise,
admitted  that his primordial
responsibility as Rooms Division Director was to ensure that the 
guestrooms
measure up to the highest standards of cleanliness.  He supplemented 
this by testifying that:


x x x.


ATTY. BAUSA:


Mr.  Habana, you confirmed
here that one of the most important functions of your room division, is 
to see
to it that the guest rooms and the public areas  in the hotel, are in 
the best condition, it is not?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. BAUSA:


I see.  And as a matter of fact, Mr. Habana, this is your 
major responsibility
in the hotel, is it not?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir, that is one of my
responsibilities.


ATTY. BAUSA:


And  that the time that you were requested to conduct 
continuous inspections
of  the rooms.... conditions of the
hotel rooms and the public areas were at the worse?


WITNESS:


Well, yes.


ATTY. BAUSA:


Just answer the question,  Mr. Habana?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


xxx.
[26]


If petitioner was 
well-aware that
conducting room inspections was a major part of his responsibilities, 
then, he
certainly had no reason to complain, much less be embarrassed about.  
Moreover,  inspections conducted by division heads are not without 
precedent.  Ms. Pearl Aragon, Hotel Nikkoâs Director
for Administration (who holds the same level position as petitioner) 
testified
that she herself  had to inspect  garbage areas and the hotel sewers and
 she
did not feel the least bit embarassed about it because it was part of 
her
work.  Even the General Manager, she
added, would go around and inspect various areas of the hotel.  She 
expounded thus:


x x x.


ATTY. ANASCO:


Q:
 
  
Mr. Habana  also claim that he 
was made to inspect
rooms, toilets, garbage areas for eight hours a day, what can you say  
about his claim, Madam Witness?


MS. ARAGON:


A:
 
  
That is something that we
are all expected to do.  I for one,
being in-charge, since I managed for instance the engineering 
department, Iâm
being asked to inspect sewage fits;  Iâm
being asked to inspect wet and dry garbage areas.  Even the GM, itself, 
would go around and inspect each
places.  So I donât think that anyone
to be  exempt to do those things.  All of us have our own duties to 
perform
and areas to visit and inspect.  I
donât think that it is unusual for asking Mr. Habana to go and inspect 
the
areas  under his responsibility.


ATTY. ANASCO:


Q:
   
You mentioned earlier
that you, yourself did kind of inspection?


MS. ARAGON:


A:
   
Yes.


ATTY. ANASCO:


Q:
 
  
When you did this
inspection, how did you feel then?


MS. ARAGON:


A:
   
Itâs part of my work as
Manager in-charge of those areas.  Itâs
my obligation to do those things, so I should do that without any 
question,
without any bitterness, without any thinking that Iâm being downgraded 
or being
put to embarrassment or anything.  Just
performing my regular job.

Petitionerâs complaint 
that he was
made to conduct  inspections the whole
day while his two subordinates were assigned only a few hours each is
unmeritorious.  Petitioner was the
head of his division.  Precisely, it
was his duty to take command responsibility.  Sadly, petitioner has lost
 sight of the fact that being a leader is not
all  prestige and glamour but includes,
in great measure, hard work.  Being
charged to take action is not harassment but a challenge to petitionerâs
leadership capability.


Petitioner puts too much
emphasis  on the  merit for cleanliness given to Hotel Nikko
in 1989 by the Department of Tourism.  He stated that the same was 
awarded at the time he took over the helm of
the hotelâs Rooms Division.


This pronouncement 
deserves scant
consideration.  Firstly, in his
testimony during the 11 March 1992 hearing, petitioner explicitly stated
 that
he was not aware that Hotel Nikko was awarded such recognition,
[28]
 Secondly,  the
Hotel must be able to maintain, if not surpass, the same standard of
cleanliness which merited them the award in the first place.  Hence, the
 need for the daily inspections.


Equating the âdaily 
inspection
measureâ to harassment is but the result of petitionerâs misplaced 
perception.  On the contrary, it was a valid solution
conceived by top management to counter guest complaints on the state of 
hotelâs
guestrooms and public areas.  It cannot
be denied that cleanliness is top priority in the hotel business.  
Petitioner was the Rooms Division Director
and  this was his responsibility.  He was not singled out.  He was 
simply called to task.


Another act of 
harassment,
petitioner contends, was his unceremonious  ouster from his old office 
and his transfer to a âpitiable passageway.â


Petitioner exaggerates.  
As found by the Labor Arbiter  and the NLRC, said move was brought about
 by
operational necessity.  Mr. Okawa needed
a room which could be divided into an office and a meeting area.
 
[29]
Again, this is not an uncommon practice.  
From her own experience, Ms. Aragon
testified thus:


x x x.


ATTY. ANASCO:


Q:
 
  
Another form of
harassment that Mr. Habana claimed is that he was transferred from big 
room to
small room, what can you say about this, Madam Witness?


MS. ARAGON:


A:
 
  
The relocation of office
has happened several times.  I for one,
again, as an example, used to occupy a forty (40) square meter room and 
my
secretary in that room.  Now, Iâm
occupying a twelve (12) square meter room because my room had to be 
given with
the new PHI President.  These things we
have to do to  give way to some
operational requirements.  Itsâ not the
first time it happened.


ATTY. ANASCO:


Q: 
 For  the record what is your present position?


MS. ARAGON:


A:
   
Iâm the Director for
Administration and I have five departments under me.  Iâm supervising 
personnel, accounting, training, engineeering
and purchasing.  Iâd like to say it is
the same level  Mr. Habana used to
occupy, a director level.


x x x.
[30]
 


Petitioner also claims  
that his alleged exclusion from the regular
staff meetings held by Mr. Okawa and the removal of his name from the 
hotelâs
personnel requisition forms  were
concoctions aimed to force him to resign.


On  the first claim,  
aside
from petitionerâs self-serving allegation, there is nothing in the 
record to
support the same.  On the second
accusation, we agree with the findings of the Labor Arbiter.  Said 
rearrangement was not intended to ease
petitioner out, rather it was to enable Mr. Okawa, petitionerâs 
immediate
supervisor âto have stricter control inasmuch as in the past, there were
 many
occasions that the hiring, recruitment and transfer of employees were 
being
freezed by the Rooms Division Head.â
[31]


In sum, the various 
measures
executed by the hotelâs top management were not acts of harassment but 
were
legitimate exercise of management prerogatives.  In  
San Miguel 
Brewery
Sales Force Union (PTGWO) v. Ople
,
[32]
 when  San
Miguelâs marketing scheme known as the âComplementary Distribution 
Systemâ
(CDS), [whereby its beer products were offered for sale directly to 
wholesalers
through its sales offices] came under fire for allegedly reducing the 
take-home
pay of its route salesmen and truck helpers since the company, in 
effect, would
be competing with them, we held:


Public respondent was correct in holding that the CDS is a 
valid
exercise of management prerogatives:


â
Except as limited by special laws, an employer is free
 to
regulate, according to his own discretion and judgment, all aspects of
employment,
 including hiring, work assignments, working methods, 
time,
place and manner of work, tools to be used, 
processes to be followed
,
supervision of workers, working regulations, transfer of employees, work
supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall
 of
work. x x x (NLU 
vs
. Insular La Yebana Co., 2 SCRA 924;  Republic
 Savings Bank 
vs
. CIR, 21
SCRA 226, 235.)â  (Perfecto V.
Hernandez, Labor Relations Law, 1985 ED., p. 44.)  (Italics ours.)


Every business enterprise endeavors to increase its profits.
  In the process, it may adopt or devise
means designed towards that goal.  In
Abott Laboratories 
vs
. NLRC, 154 SCRA 713, We ruled:


âx x x Even as the law is solicitous of the welfare of the
employees, it must also protect the right of an employer to exercise 
what are
clearly management prerogatives.  The
free will of management to conduct its own business affairs to achieve 
its
purpose cannot be denied.â


So long as a companyâs management prerogatives are exercised
 in
good faith for the advancement of the employerâs interest and not for 
the
purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under 
special
laws or under valid agreements, this Court will uphold them (LVN 
Pictures
Workers 
vs
. LVN, 35 SCRA 147;  Phil.  American Embroideries 
vs
.
Embroidery and Garment Workers, 26 SCRA 634;  Phil. Refining Co. 
vs
.
 Garcia, 18 SCRA 110). 


The
harassment
 issue raised by petitioner was but a smokescreen to conceal  his own 
shortcomings.


The next issue to be 
resolved is
whether or not petitioner voluntarily resigned.  Petitioner asserts that
 private respondents coerced and
intimidated him into resigning through their collective acts of 
harassment
which caused him tremendous psychological and emotional stress.  He 
further alleges that the  
P
120,000.00 separation pay was the
pay-off offered by Hotel Nikko in exchange for his resignation.  
Petitioner stresses that he had no
intention of resigning as manifested in his memorandum  dated 27 April 
1990, the pertinent portion
of which states:


x x x.


When I issued a memorandum to a
subordinate who had repeatedly failed to follow the hotelâs SOPâs, you
reprimanded me and instructed me not to send out memos anymore.  When I 
tried to explain, you shouted at me
and ordered me to resign.  I would like
to make it of record that I have no plans to resign because I have not 
done
anything which warrants me to do so.  I
will try to do my job to the best of my ability despite that fact that 
you have
been persistently making my working conditions unbearable in order to 
force me
to resign;


x x x.
[33]
 


Contrariwise, private 
respondents
contend that it was petitioner who approached (around the first week of 
April
1990)  Ms.  Aragon indicating his desire to resign due to his 
âdifficulty in
coping with his responsibilities as Rooms Division Directorâ
[34]
 and his differences with his immediate boss, 
Mr.
Okawa.  Petitioner wanted a severance
pay of  P250,000.00 and he solicited Ms.
Aragonâs assistance in this regard.  Negotiations  ensued until both
parties (petitioner and Hotel Nikko through Ms. Aragon) agreed on  
P120,000.00  as separation pay.  Thereafter,
on 2 May 1990, petitioner went to the office of the Comptroller, Mr. 
Rosales to
get his check.  Upon  Mr. Rosalesâ request, pursuant to hotel
policy, petitioner prepared his letter of resignation (typed by Mr. 
Rosalesâ
secretary) and submitted it to  the
former.


We agree with  private 
respondents that petitioner
voluntarily resigned.  


Voluntary resignation is 
defined
as the voluntary act of  an employee who
âfinds himself in a situation where he believes that personal reasons 
cannot be
sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service and he has no other 
choice
but to dissassociate himself from his employement.â
[35]
 In this case, as indicated in the various 
memoranda
he received from his superiors, petitioner was clearly  having trouble 
performing his job, one which
undeniably carries immense responsibilities.  Notable too was 
petitionerâs failure to see eye to eye with
his  immediate bosses, first, Mr. Yokoo
and then Mr. Okawa.  Because of these
difficulties, it was quite reasonable for petitioner to think of, and
eventually, relinquishing his position voluntarily (and get a fat sum as
severance pay in the bargain) instead of waiting to be fired.


Petitioner could not have
been  intimidated  by  private  respondents to
quit.  In his 27 April 1990 memorandum,
petitioner emphatically vowed not to resign despite private respondentsâ
alleged acts of harassment.  Surprisingly, however, after only a few 
days he did quit alleging that
he was forced and harassed to do so.  If petitioner was adamant in his 
intention not to be coerced into
leaving,  how could  he suddenly be forced to resign.  Petitioner 
glaringly contradicted
himself.  His excuse is, thus,
unbelievable and unjustifiable.


 
Guatson Intâl. 
Travel & Tours vs. NLRC
[36]
does
 not
apply in this case.  The factual milieu
is different and more importantly the 
Guatson
 case  involved a  
mere messenger who, understandably, could easily be cowed and forced by
his employer to quit, while the case at bar involves a well-educated
professional and  a managerial employee
at that.  The ruling in 
Samaniego v.
NLRC
[37]
 
is
instructive:


It must be emphasized as well that the petitioners are not 
ordinary
laborers or rank-and-file personnel who may not be able to completely
comprehend and realize the consequences of their acts.  The petitioners 
are managerial employees
holding responsible positions.  They are
educated individuals.  For his part,
petitioner Samaniego immediately assumed a ranking position in a 
competing
company after his  resignation from
Sandvik Philippines, Inc.  Under these
circumstances, it can hardly be said that they were coerced into 
resigning from
the company.


The Solicitor General maintains that receipt of separation 
pay is
not a bar to contesting the legality of dismissal from employment.  The 
observation is beside the point.  As stated earlier, there is no illegal
dismissal in the case at bar.  


From the foregoing, it clearly appears that the petitioners
voluntarily resigned from the company for a valuable consideration.  The
 quitclaim they executed in favor of the
company amounts to a valid and binding compromise agreement.  To allow  
the petitioners to repudiate the same will be to countenance unjust
enrichment on their part.  The Court
will not permit such a situation.


Petitioner tries to belie
 private
respondentsâ contention that they negotiated for the formerâs separation
 pay by
pointing out that the negotiations allegedly began in the first week of 
April
1990 but petitioner categorically stated on 27 April 1990 that he would 
not
resign.


Petitionerâs claim is not
convincing.  As testified by  Ms.  Aragon, in early April 1990, 
petitioner told her  he was thinking of resigning.  At that time 
petitioner had not yet made up
his mind.  Apparently, he made his
decision to voluntarily quit after 27 April 1990 and after finally 
agreeing on
the P120,000.00 separation pay.


Furthermore, the fact 
that Mr.
Rosales, the hotelâs Comptroller required petitioner to submit a 
resignation
letter before his separation pay was  released did not militate against 
the voluntariness of his
resignation.  Petitioner readily
acceded and was the one who dictated the contents of the said letter to 
Mr.
Rosalesâ secretary who typed the same and he showed neither resistance 
nor
protest when he submitted his letter of resignation.
[38]


Finally, the timing of
petitionerâs letter of protest, which he sent to private respondents 
just after
he received the check for his severance pay  on 3 May 1990,   arouses 
suspicion
of bad faith.  He wanted to exact
something more from  private  respondents despite his voluntary
resignation and acceptance of a huge amount of separation pay.


In  view of the foregoing
 findings,  petitionerâs claim  for  damages must,  likewise, fail.

 premises considered, the petition for 
certiorari
 is hereby
