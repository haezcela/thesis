MABUHAY DEVELOPMENT
INDUSTRIES, BOA BROTHERS COMPANY, AND ANTONIO YU LIM BO, PETITIONERS, VS.
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, LORENZO BADELLES, HIPOLITO RAGO, AND
MELCHOR REBUYON, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


This is
a petition for 
certiorari
 to set aside the decision of the National
Labor Relations Commission finding petitioners guilty of illegally dismissing
private respondents and ordering their reinstatement with backwages,  reversing for this purpose the labor
arbiterâs contrary decision.


The
facts are as follows:


Petitioners
Mabuhay Development Industries and BOA Brothers Company are general
partnerships owned and managed by petitioner Antonio Yu Lim Bo.  Private respondents Lorenzo Badelles and
Hipolito Rago were employed as truck drivers at Mabuhay Development Industries
and BOA Brothers Company, respectively, while private respondent Melchor
Rebuyon was employed as truckman or helper at BOA Brothers Company.  Private respondentsâ job was to receive
stocks at the Zamboanga City pier and transport these to the Zamboanga Foodmart
of petitioners.


On
September 3, 1984, private respondents Hipolito Rago and Melchor Rebuyon,
together with four others, were suspended by petitioner Antonio Yu Lim Bo
because of alleged shortages in their delivery.
[1]
 Private respondents were
subsequently separated from employment on the basis of letters of resignation
signed by them on September 7, 1984.
[2]
 


On
November 5, 1984, private respondents Lorenzo Badelles and Hipolito Rago filed
a complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for reinstatement against Mabuhay
Development Industries, BOA Brothers Company, and Antonio Yu Lim Bo, while
private respondent Melchor Rebuyon filed a similar complaint against BOA
Brothers Company and Antonio Yu Lim Bo on March 18, 1985.
[3]


In
their Joint Affidavit (Exh. B)
[4]
 submitted to the Labor
Arbiter, private respondents claimed that their liability for some missing
items (for which they were dismissed) had not been established; that âthe
alleged missing crate of pancit was found, while the alleged missing cartons of
edible oil were already missing at the Blas Perez warehouse in Canelar,
Zamboanga City,â when the  private  respondents received the delivery;  that the termination of their employment was
without just cause and made without sufficient investigation, and in an
arbitrary manner; that they were forced to sign letters of resignation prepared
in the office of petitioner Antonio Yu Lim Bo on pain that if they refused they
would not be paid for their services from August 16-31, 1984.
[5]


Petitioners
likewise submitted a position paper
[6]
 in which they alleged that
in an investigation conducted by them, private respondents admitted liability
for the missing items;  that respondents
offered to resign in exchange for petitionersâ agreement not to file criminal
charges against them and to pay for the missing carton of edible oil.


On July
25, 1989, the Labor Arbiter rendered a joint decision in the two cases,
dismissing the complaints of private respondents.  He found that private respondents had not been dismissed but that
they had resigned after being found responsible for the losses.
[7]


A copy
of the decision was served on private respondentsâ counsel on August 18, 1989.
[8]
 Private respondents
appealed to the NLRC by filing an appeal memorandum on August 30, 1989 and
paying the appeal fees on September 1, 1989.
[9]


On
April 27, 1992, the NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and ordered
the petitioners to reinstate private respondents to their former positions
without loss of seniority and other privileges and benefits and to pay them
backwages for three years âwithout qualification or deduction.â In addition,
petitioners were ordered to pay attorneyâs fees equal to ten (10) percent of
the total monetary award.
[10]
 The NLRC found that
private respondents had been illegally dismissed, the offense for which they
were forced to resign not having been established.  It found (1) that the letters of resignation which private
respondents were made to sign had not been translated from English in which
they were written, with the result that they were not fully understood by private
respondents; (2) that there was no evidence that private respondents signed the
letters in exchange for petitionersâ desistance from filing criminal charges
against them and (3) that before terminating private respondentsâ employment,
petitioners did not give them notice and hearing.
[11]


Petitioners
moved for the reconsideration of the decision, alleging that private
respondentsâ appeal had been filed more than ten (10) days after receipt of the
decision of the Labor Arbiter; that contrary to the NLRCâs finding, the private
respondents had been afforded due process; that private respondents had been
dismissed for cause; and that the award of three years backwages was
inconsistent with the ruling in Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio  Corporation. v.  NLRC
[12]
 because in the latter case
this Court affirmed an award of backwages for only two years.


As the
NLRC denied reconsideration of its decision, this petition was filed.  Petitioners contend:
[13]


[1] PUBLIC RESPONDENT ERRED IN
ASSUMING JURISDICTION TO REVIEW ON APPEAL THE DECISION OF THE LABOR ARBITER.


[2] PUBLIC RESPONDENT ERRED IN
ORDERING REINSTATEMENT WITH BACKWAGES.


[3] PUBLIC RESPONDENT ERRED IN
AWARDING THREE-YEAR[S] BACKWAGES.


The
petition is without merit.


First
.  
Petitioners argue that the NLRC had no
jurisdiction to review the decision of the Labor Arbiter because private
respondentsâ appeal was filed three (3) days beyond the ten (10) days provided
for in Art. 223 of the Labor Code, which provides:


Appeal
. - Decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter
are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both
parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards,
or orders.


Indeed,
as already stated, a copy of the Labor Arbiterâs decision was served on private
respondentsâ counsel on August 18, 1989 but they filed an appeal memorandum
only on August 30, 1989 and paid the appeal fees only on September 1,
1989.  As a rule, the perfection of an
appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is jurisdictional
and failure to perfect an appeal as required by law renders the judgment final
and executory.  There may be exceptional
cases, however, where, as pointed out in City Fair Corporation v. NLRC,
[14]
 greater injustice may
occur if an appeal is not given due course than if the reglementary period to
appeal were strictly followed.  In such
cases, proceedings before such agencies as the NLRC need not adhere strictly to
technicalities to attain substantial justice.


In the
case at bar, the NLRC was justified in giving Art. 223 of the Labor Code a
liberal application because, as will presently be shown, there is no clear
evidence to prove that private respondents were liable for the loss of
merchandise. In addition, petitioners did not oppose private respondentsâ
appeal or question the jurisdiction of the NLRC until an adverse judgment was
rendered against them.  Petitioners were
thus estopped to deny the jurisdiction of the NLRC.


Second.  Petitioners contend that under Art. 279 of
the Labor Code an order to reinstate and pay backwages can be made only if it
is found that an employee was unjustly dismissed, but, in the case at bar, the
only issue before the NLRC was whether private respondents had been dismissed
without due process of law because the fact is that private respondents had
admitted liability for the shortages.  


This is
not true.  Private respondents did not
admit liability for the loss of certain items entrusted to them for delivery to
petitionersâ Zamboanga Foodmart.  As the
NLRC stated, the âalleged offense [for which private respondents were dismissed
or made to resign] was never established.â
[15]
 Contrary to petitionersâ
claim, private respondents denied they signed letters of resignation in order
to avoid criminal prosecution for the loss of the grocery items.  They claimed they were forced to resign
because petitioners threatened to withhold their wages.  Moreover, as the NLRC found, the letters of
resignation were in English and were not translated or explained to them.  


Indeed,  the records show  that private respondentsâ job was mainly to transport stocks
belonging to petitioners from the pier in Zamboanga City and transport them to
the warehouse of Zamboanga Foodmart or from the warehouse of the various
shipping companies and deliver them to the display center of the Zamboanga
Foodmart.
[16]
 Petitionersâ evidence
consisted of the affidavits and testimonies of its warehouseman and checker,
Catalino Guadalupe and Sesinio Montana.  Guadalupe testified that he found some items listed in the delivery
receipt to be missing and that he brought this matter to the attention of Mary
Lim, Mabuhay Development Industries comptroller.  The delivery receipts were never presented in evidence to show
that indeed some items listed therein could not be accounted for when private
respondents made delivery at the Zamboanga Foodmart. 


What is
more, Guadalupe said he could not tell whether the missing items (two cartons
of SkyFlakes biscuits) had been delivered to private respondents for
transportation to the Zamboanga Foodmart or whether they were already missing
when the cargo was received by private respondents from the warehouse.  The testimony of Guadalupe, slightly edited,
is as follows:
[17]


Q
                
- 
          
Where did you discover these two (2)
cartons of sky flakes as you said lacking? 


A
                 
- 
          
At the premises of Zamboanga Food
Mart, when they deliver goods they have a list with them coming from the bodega
of the shipping lines.  I [compared]
this is what is actually received by me and I discovered two (2) cartons of sky
flakes missing. 
  I do not know what
happen whether they received lacking or whatever. 


Q
                
-
           
So that when you discovered that two
(2) cartons was lacking you immediately made your report that two (2) cartons
are lacking? 


A
                 
-
           
Yes sir.


. . . . 


Q
                
- 
          
You mentioned the fact that you were
ahead in the employment of Food Mart than the other (3) companions in this case
before this particular incidents, was there any other incidents that had also
been guilty of the same missing item being reported in the deliveries if they
committed similar things previous to this incident?


A
                 
- 
          
Only as far the goods received by me
by Food Mart, as they made other short delivery, I do not know. 


Q
                
-
           
In fact you do not know if the
cargo that is loaded in the shipping lines/warehouse are already missing you do
not know about that, until it was delivered the warehouse of the Food Mart, is
it  not?
 


A
                 
-
           
Actually my basis is the list that is
supplied by the shipping lines and when the goods arrived at the Food Mart, I
made a particular count.  
I only made
a particular count/check with the list and as brought by the shipping lines and
see if they tally.


Thus,
as observed by the NLRC:
[18]


[T]he alleged offense was never
established, the missing crate of pancit was found and the alleged lost cartons
of edible oil was [sic] already missing at the bodega of Foodmart at the Blas
Perez warehouse.  Nevertheless,
respondent-appellee Antonio Yu Lim Bo dismissed complainants-appellants from
their employment on September 1984, by forcing the latter to sign their
respective prepared letters of resignation in exchange [for] their withheld
August 16 to 31, 1984 salaries, (Exh. âBâ).


In
Anscor Transport & Terminals, Inc. v. NLRC,
[19]
 a similar observation was
made:


We reject, indeed, Anscorâs claims
that in absolving Crisostomo, the respondent Commission had misapprehended the
facts or had speculated merely on the events.  We do not find to be well-taken its reliance on the pieces of evidence
supposedly unearthed during the investigation of the case pointing allegedly to
Crisostomoâs culpability.  Cargo receipt
No. 10485, which Crisostomo allegedly signed and which allegedly indicated that
450 bags of fertilizer were loaded on board the delivery truck, is not
sufficient proof that 450 bags were, in fact, stowed on the truck.  Although the private respondent signed the
receipt, he is not necessarily bound by its contents, or does he guarantee its
correctness, in the absence of any showing that he took part in the loading of
the cargo. . . .


Nor
were private respondents accorded a hearing. The investigation that
petitionersâ witness, Mary Lim, said she conducted was designed more to secure
private respondentsâ admission of their culpability than to give them an
opportunity to be heard to find out if they were guilty.  As we have stated time and again, in
investigations of this nature, the employee must be given two notices: (1)
notice of the charges against him with opportunity to be heard in his defense
and (2) in the event the employer finds the employee guilty, notice of his
dismissal stating clearly the grounds therefor.
[20]
 That none of these
requisites was followed in this case is clear from the affidavit
[21]
 of Mary Lim, in which she
stated:


[A]ll employees report to me all unusual
happenings at Foodmart; 


[O]n June 26, 1984 Dante Penetrante
reported to me that Hipolito Rago and his truckman short-delivered two (2)
cartoons (sic) of skyflakes biscuits to Foodmart although per the Delivery
Receipt of the Shipping Lines they have made a complete withdrawal from the
bodega of the shipping lines at the late Blas Perez Compound; 


[O]n August 9, 1984 same fellow
reported to me another short delivery of one (1) cartoon (sic) edible oil by
the driver Hipolito Rago and his truckman to Foodmart.  The Delivery Receipt of the shipping lines
clearly stated that they have made a complete withdrawal and in fact the driver
acknowledged to have received from the checker of the shipping lines all the
goods stated in the delivery receipt; 


[O]n August 31, 1984 at about 3:00
p.m. in the afternoon, I noticed through the window of my office at the second
floor of Foodmart that there were deliveries of goods by Lorenzo Badelles and
his truckman.  I was surprised to notice
that Lorenzo Badelles is carrying the stocks himself because it is not his
usual practice.  He always refused to
help in carrying goods because he claims of having back pains;  


[A]bout 1 hour after Lorenzo
Badelles and his truckman started unloading the goods I overheard some discussions
between the bodegero and Lorenzo Badelles and Rebuyon.  So I went downstairs and inquired what is
all about.  Dante and Sonny informed me
that there was again 1 crate of pancit canton short delivered.  So I asked for the delivery receipt from the
shipping line from Dante and found that the deliveries received was (sic)
complete.  So I instructed them to
recheck all the stocks that they unloaded and found out that it is really short
of one crate.  So I inquired from the
driver and his truckman Melchor Rebuyon who were inside the Foodmart premises
at this time if there were other stocks still found in the truck and both of
them answered in the negative;  


[A]ll the while Lorenzo Badelles is
(sic) the one carrying all the stocks to the Foodmart and his truckman Melchor
Rebuyon is (sic) the one who stayed on top of the truck doing the unloading for
Lorenzo Badelles to bring the stocks inside the Foodmart premises;  


[T]he following morning I
instructed my brother-in-law Mr. Francis G. Lim to do some investigation
pertaining to the constant losses of stock at Foodmart perpetrated by these two
drivers.  That I was informed later on
by Francis G. Lim that Lorenzo Badelles signified his intention to resign and
so I told Francis Lim to inventory his tools in the truck and his other
accountabilities;  


[O]n September 2, 1984, Francis Lim
informed me that Lorenzo Badelles instead of resigning that day he was now
cleaning the truck he is driving and not satisfied with his investigation I
instructed him to send (sic) Melchor Rebuyon, Hipolito Rago, Benjamin Mariano
and Lorenzo Badelles and other truckmen who used to accompany these two drivers
to the wharf to get cargoes to the Zamboanga Foodmart;  


I confronted each of them
separately and requested them to tell me all about the happenings (sic)  during the losses and I hinted that I  will forgive them for the last time should
they tell me the truth;  


I also told them that there are
(sic) at least two laborers who told me about the mod[us] of operand[i] of
these people and 
my purpose of calling them for confrontation was only to
counter check what the other laborers have already told me.  That I even hinted that if they will not
tell me the truth and if I have sufficient evidence and witnesses to support
(sic) I am going to file attempted theft case against them;  


[I]mmediately they told me that
they will just resign.  âResign na lang
kame para walay samokâ So I told them you go and see Maricor Sta. Teresa for
your clearances;


In her
testimony before the Labor Arbiter, Mary Lim said:
[22]


Q
    
-
           
Did you conduct [an] investigation? 


A
     
-
           
Yes 


Q
    
-
           
What kind of investigation did you
conduct? 


A
     
-
           
I called them 


Q
                
-
           
Aside from that investigation you did
not conduct any kind of investigation? 


A
                 
-
           
I called also those in charge in
[the] bodega and also the shipping lines 


Q
                
-
           
On the dates previous to this,
despite [of] that, nothing came out of this and these workers?  


A
     
-
           
I warned them.


. . . .


Q.
               
-
           
Now, in the first 2 incidents
regarding the skyflakes and the edible oil you said you conducted an
investigation and suppose was made on the driver? 


A
     
-
           
It was not on the driver alone all
and the truckman. 


Q
    
-
           
Did you get their statement?
 


A
     
-
           
I did not get.


Q
    
-
           
So that is how you conducted the
investigation? 


A
                 
-
           
They are (not) under the supervision
of my brother-in-law so I requested my brother-in-law he told me nobody tell
the truth.  


Q
    
-
           
Your conclusion the driver was
responsible of the los[s].  


A
                 
-
           
Before they left the shipping
lines their duties to check the stock, itâs presumed that they received the
stock and anything goes wrong they have the knowledge.
 


Q
                
-
           
So that base on that thinking that
you concluded the driver was responsible.  And in the same manner in the case of pancit as you said that somebody
was trying to . . .  in the truck
because you believe that the driver purposely kept the carton described.
 


A
                 
-
           
We cannot tell because the truck is outside
. . . and the driver can just drive and . . . 


.  .  .  . 


Q.
               
- 
          
Iâm asking as of [sic] result of these
incidents you threat[ened] to charge these persons. 


A
                 
-
           
I called them up I made the
investigation I told them to tell the truth and who are really involve[d].  


Q
                
-
           
Do you not ask them to resign? 


A
                 
-
           
I did not. 


Q
                
-
           
As a result of these incidents who
removed these people? 


A
                 
-
           
After the incidents that very day I
called up my brother-in-law to make necessary investigation and find out who
are really the culprit.  


Q
                
-
           
This brother-in-law is Francis Lim,
did he make any report? 


A
                 
-
           
That is not our standard
procedure.  


Q
                
-
           
Of course you did not see him
conducting investigation. 


A
                 
-
           
He was not able to make the
investigation because the driver and truckman already left.


Thus,
no investigation as required by law was ever made in this case.  Mary Lim simply presumed that the missing
goods had been received by private respondents and since the latter could not
account for them when the stocks were delivered by them, private respondents
were presumed to be liable for the loss.  This could only be due to the fact that Mary Limâs purpose in
investigating was not to give private respondents the opportunity to explain
but to make them admit what Mary Lim had been told by other employees.  As she admitted in her affidavit, Mary Lim
threatened private respondents with criminal prosecution if they did not
confess their guilt.  Her claim before
the Labor Arbiter that she had asked her brother-in-law, Francis Lim, to
conduct a formal investigation but the latter was not able to do so because
private respondents had âalready leftâ betrays the utter lack of an
investigation which should have preceded the dismissal of private respondents. 


It is
then clear that petitioners failed to prove not only the existence of just
cause but they also failed to prove that the private respondents were afforded
due process.  Art.  277(b) of the Labor Code places the burden
of proving that the termination of employment was for a valid or authorized
cause on the employer.  The employerâs
failure to discharge this burden  means
that the dismissal is not justified and the employee is entitled to reinstatement.
[23]
 Hence, the NLRC correctly
ordered petitioners to reinstate private respondents and pay them backwages. 


Third
.

Petitionersâ last contention is that the award of backwages should be limited
to two years only.  They cite
Globe-MacKay Cable and Radio Corporation v. NLRC
[24]
 in support of their
contention.  Although in that case
recovery of backwages was limited to two years,  the matter was not really in issue.  There is no discussion why the award was thus limited.  The Court simply affirmed the award made by
the NLRC.  But decisions involving this
issue uniformly provided for an award of backwages equivalent to three years
without qualification or deduction as a ârealistic, reasonable and mutually
beneficial solution.â
[25]
 After the effectivity of
R.A. No. 6715 on March 21, 1989 the rule was changed so that an illegally
dismissed employee is now entitled to an award of full backwages.
[26]
 However, as private
respondentsâ dismissal took place on September 7, 1984, the new rule cannot be
applied because R.A. No. 6715 has no retroactive application.
[27]
 The NLRC correctly ordered
petitioners to pay backwages for three (3) years without qualification or
deduction.  


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DISMISSED
and the decision of the NLRC is AFFIRMED.
