MENDOZA, J.:


The question for decision is
whether in assessing the docket fees to be paid for the filing of an action for
annulment or rescission of a contract of sale, the value of the real property,
subject matter of the contract, should be used as basis, or whether the action
should be considered as one which is not capable of pecuniary estimation and
therefore the fee charged should be a flat rate of P400.00 as provided in Rule
141, Â§7(b)(1) of the Rules of Court.  The trial court held the fees should be based on the value of the
property, but the Court of Appeals reversed and held that the flat rate should
be charged.  Hence this petition for
review on 
certiorari
.


The
facts are as follows:


On August 8, 1991, private
respondents filed in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City a complaint for
annulment or rescission of a contract of sale of two (2) parcels of land  against petitioners, praying for the
following reliefs:


1.
      
Ordering the nullification or rescission
of the Contract of Conditional Sale (Supplementary Agreement) for having
violated the rights of plaintiffs (private respondents) guaranteed to them
under Article 886 of the Civil Code and/or violation of the terms and
conditions of the said contract.


2.
      
Declaring
void ab initio the Deed of Absolute Sale for being absolutely simulated; and


3.
      
Ordering defendants (petitioners) to pay
plaintiffs (private respondents) attorneyâs fees in the amount of 
P
100,000.00.


Other
reliefs and remedies as are just and equitable in the premises are also prayed
for.
[1]


Upon the filing of the complaint,
the  clerk of court required private
respondents to pay docket and legal fees in the total amount of 
P
610.00,
broken down as follows:


P
450.00 - 
    
Docket fee for the Judicial Development Fund
under Official Receipt No. 1877773


150.00
-
       
Docket fee for the General Fund
under Official Receipt No. 6834215


  10.00 -
        
for
the Legal Research Fund under Official Receipt No. 6834450.
[2]


On September 26, 1991,
petitioners moved for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the
trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case by reason of private
respondentsâ nonpayment of the correct amount of docket fees. Petitioners
contended that in addition to the fees already paid based on the claim for 
P
100,000.00
for attorneyâs fees, private respondents should have paid docket fees in the
amount of 
P
21,640.00, based on the alleged value of the two (2) parcels
of land subject matter of the contract of sale sought to be annulled.
[3]


On
September 30, 1991, private respondents filed opposition to the motion to
dismiss, arguing that outright dismissal of their complaint was not warranted
on the basis of the alleged nonpayment of the correct amount of docket fees,
considering that the amount paid by them was that assessed by the clerk of
court.
[4]
 On October 9, 1991, petitioners filed a reply to
which private respondents filed, on October 17, 1991, a rejoinder. 


On
October 21, 1991, the trial court
[5]
 denied petitionersâ motion to dismiss but required
private respondents to pay the amount of docket fees based on the estimated
value of the parcels of land in litigation as stated in the complaint.


Private
respondents filed a motion for reconsideration but their motion was denied by
the trial court. They therefore, brought the matter to the Court of Appeals
which, on February 26, 1992, rendered a decision
[6]
 annulling the orders of the trial court.  The appellate court held that an action for
rescission or annulment of contract is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation
and, therefore, the docket fees should not be based on the value of the real
property, subject matter of the contract sought to be annulled or rescinded.
Petitioners moved for reconsideration, but their  motion was denied in a resolution dated March 25, 1992 of the
appellate court.
      
Hence, this petition
for review on certiorari.

In a real action, the assessed value of the property, or if there is
none, the estimated value thereof shall be alleged by the claimant and shall be
the basis in computing the fees
.
(emphasis added)


Petitioners
argue that an action for annulment or rescission of a contract of sale of real
property is a real action and, therefore, the amount of the docket fees to be
paid by private respondent should be based either on the assessed value of the
property, subject matter of the action, or its estimated value as alleged in
the complaint, pursuant to the last paragraph of Â§7(b) of Rule 141, as amended
by the Resolution of the Court dated September 12, 1990. Since private
respondents alleged that the land, in which they claimed an interest as heirs,
had been sold for 
P
4,378,000.00 to petitioners, this amount should be
considered the estimated value of the land for the purpose of determining the
docket fees.


On
the other hand, private respondents counter that an action for annulment or
rescission of a contract of sale of real property  is incapable of pecuniary estimation and, so, the docket fees
should be the fixed amount of 
P
400.00 in Rule 141, Â§7(b)(1). In support
of their argument, they cite the cases of 
Lapitan v. Scandia, Inc.
[7]
 and 
Bautista v. Lim.
[8]
 
  In 
Lapitan 
this Court, in an opinion
by Justice J.B.L. Reyes, held:


A
review of the jurisprudence of this Court indicates that in determining whether
an action is one the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary
estimation, this Court has adopted the criterion of first ascertaining the
nature of the principal action or remedy sought.  If it is primarily for the recovery of a sum of money, the claim
is considered capable of pecuniary estimation, and whether jurisdiction is in
the municipal courts or in the courts of first instance would depend on the
amount of the claim.  However, where the
basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, or
where the money claim is purely incidental to, or a consequence of, the
principal relief sought, like in suits to have the defendant perform his part
of the contract (specific performance) and in actions for support, or for
annulment of a judgment or to foreclose a mortgage, this Court has considered
such actions as cases where the subject of the litigation may not be estimated
in terms of money, and are cognizable  exclusively by courts of first instance.  The rationale of the rule is plainly that the second class cases,
besides the determination of damages, demand an inquiry into other factors
which the law has deemed to be more within the competence of courts of first
instance, which were the lowest courts of record at the time that the first
organic laws of the Judiciary were enacted allocating jurisdiction (Act 136 of
the Philippine Commission of June 11, 1901). 


Actions
for specific performance of contracts have been expressly pronounced to be
exclusively cognizable by courts of first instance: De Jesus vs. Judge Garcia,
L-26816, February 28, 1967; Manufacturerâs Distributors, Inc. vs. Yu Siu Liong,
L-21285, April 29, 1966.  And no cogent
reason appears, and none is here advanced by the parties, why an action for
rescission (or resolution) should be differently treated, a ârescissionâ being
a counterpart, so to speak, of âspecific performanceâ. In both cases, the court
would certainly have to undertake an investigation into facts that would
justify one act or the other.  No award
for damages may be had in an action for rescission without first conducting an
inquiry into matters which would justify the setting aside of a contract, in
the same manner that courts of first instance would have to make findings of
fact and law in actions not capable of pecuniary estimation expressly held to
be so by this Court, arising from issues like those raised in Arroz v. Alojado,
et al., L-22153, March 31, 1967 (the legality or illegality of the conveyance
sought for and the determination of the validity of the money deposit made); De
Ursua v. Pelayo, L-13285, April 18, 1950 (validity of a judgment); Bunayog v.
Tunas, L-12707, December 23, 1959 (validity of a mortgage); Baito v. Sarmiento,
L-13105, August 25, 1960 (the relations of the parties, the right to support created
by the relation, etc., in actions for support); De Rivera, et al. v. Halili,
L-15159, September 30, 1963 (the validity or nullity of documents upon which
claims are predicated).  Issues of the
same nature may be raised by a party against whom an action for rescission has
been brought, or by the plaintiff himself.  It is, therefore, difficult to see why a prayer for damages in an action
for rescission should be taken as the basis for concluding such action as one capable
of pecuniary estimation 
Â¾
 a prayer which must be included in the main action
if plaintiff is to be compensated for what he may have suffered as a result of
the breach committed by defendant, and not later on precluded from recovering
damages by the rule against splitting a cause of action and discouraging
multiplicity of suits.


Conformably
with this discussion of actions âwhere the value of the case cannot be
estimated,â the Court in 
Bautista v. Lim
,
 
held that an action for
rescission of contract is one which cannot be estimated and therefore the
docket fee for its filing should be the flat amount of 
P
200.00 as then
fixed in the former Rule 141, Â§5(10).  Said this Court:


We
hold that Judge Dalisay did not err in considering Civil Case No. V-144 as
basically one for rescission or annulment of contract which is not susceptible
of pecuniary estimation (1 Moranâs Comments on the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed, p.
55; Lapitan vs. Scandia, Inc., L-24668, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 479, 481-483).


Consequently,
the fee for docketing it is P200, an amount already paid by plaintiff, now
respondent Matilda Lim. (She should pay also the two pesos legal research fund
fee, if she has not paid it, as required in Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3870,
the charter of the U.P. Law Center).


Thus,
although eventually the result may be the recovery of land, it is the nature of
the action as one for rescission of contract which is controlling. The Court of
Appeals correctly applied these cases to the present one.  As it said:


We
would like to add the observations that since the action of petitioners
[private respondents] against private respondents [petitioners] is solely for
annulment or rescission which is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation, the
action should not be confused and equated with the âvalue of the propertyâ subject
of the transaction; that by the very nature of the case, the allegations, and
specific prayer in the complaint, sans any prayer for recovery of money and/or
value of the transaction, or for actual or compensatory damages, the assessment
and collection of the legal fees should not be intertwined with the merits of
the case and/or what may be its end result; and that to sustain private
respondentsâ [petitionersâ] position on what the respondent court may decide
after all, then the assessment should be deferred and finally assessed only
after the court had finally decided the case, which cannot be done because the
rules require that filing fees should be based on what is alleged and prayed
for in the face of the complaint and paid upon the filing of the complaint.

the  Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
