[ A.M. No.CA-98-8-P, March 11, 1998 ]


OFFICE OF THE COURT
ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. MYRNA ALVAREZ (CA PERSONNEL CONCERNED), RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


From the
decision of the Regional Trial Court â Branch 135, in Civil Case No. 88-1558
entitled âJuan Perez, Jr. and Alicia Perez 
vs.
 Alfredo Mesias and
Candido Silaoâ for Loss and Damages,
[1]
 herein petitioners appealed to the
Court of Appeals.  This appeal was dismissed
in a resolution dated January 15, 1996
[2]
 for failure to pay the required
docket fees.  A motion for
reconsideration thereof was filed by petitioners but was denied by the Court of
Appeals in its March 29, 1996 resolution.
[3]


As a result of
which, a special civil action for 
certiorari
[4]
 
was filed by petitioners with the Supreme Court on
June 25, 1996 assailing the denial of the motion for reconsideration and
imputing the delay in the filing thereof to the misleading instructions of a
certain Court of Appeals employee.  Said
petition for 
certiorari
 was dismissed by the Supreme Court in its
resolution dated July 24, 1996
[5]
 for having been filed beyond the
reglementary period.  Petitioners filed
a motion for reconsideration which the Supreme Court denied with finality in
its September 23, 1996 resolution.
[6]


Pursuant to an
internal resolution dated July 24, 1996,
[7]
 the First Division of this Court,
instructed the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to conduct an
investigation relative to the actuations of Court of Appeals employee Myrna
Alvarez who allegedly misled petitioners and caused the late filing of their
motion to admit payment of docket fee in CA-G.R. CV UDK No. 3346 and which led
to the dismissal of their appeal in the said court.


The factual
background which spawned the investigation is adequately summarized in the
Memorandum submitted by the Court Administrator to the Chairman, First Division
on September 30, 1997, and which is quoted hereunder:


âAn adverse decision of RTC, Branch
135, Makati City in Civil Case No. 88-1558 entitled âJuan Perez, Jr. and Alicia
Perez 
vs.
 Alfredo Mesias and Candido Silaoâ for Loss and Damages was
appealed by defendants-appellants to the Court of Appeals but was dismissed per
Resolution dated January 15, 1996 for failure to pay the required docket
fees.  Said resolution was received by
defendants-appellants on January 22, 1996.


On January 25, 1996 a motion for
reconsideration of said resolution and cash payment of 
P
400.00 for
docket fees were brought by Ms. Jaralyn Cesar, a staff of Atty. Semproniano
Ochoco (counsel for defendants-appellants), to the Court of Appeals for filing
where one Ms. Myrna Alvarez, an employee of the Court of Appeals, Docket
Section allegedly refused to accept the payment as well as the motion and
instead instructed Ms. Jaralyn Cesar to pay the docket fees by money order
payable to the Court of Appeals.  That
same day Ms. Cesar, as alleged in her âSinumpaang Salaysay,â proceeded to the
Caloocan City Post Office, to purchase the needed postal money orders and
mailed these to the Court of Appeals.  Thereafter she returned to the Court of Appeals to file the motion for
reconsideration but Ms. Alvarez still allegedly refused to accept the pleading
in question.  Once again she directed
Ms. Cesar to have the pleading changed to a âMotion to Admit Payment of Docket
Fee.â


The following day, January 26, 1996
Ms. Cesar filed the motion to admit payment of docket fee but Ms. Alvarez again
rejected it on ground that the postal money order checks must first be received
by the Court of Appeals and that they still have to wait for fifteen (15) days
more.  Ms. Alvarez further told Ms.
Cesar to just wait for her call.


Three (3) days later, (January 29,
1996) Ms. Cesar again filed the aforementioned motion but was again rejected
for the same reason that the Court of Appeals had not yet received the postal
money order.  It was only on February
14, 1996 that the aforesaid motion was finally admitted but was eventually
denied by the Court of Appeals for having been filed beyond the reglementary
period.


Consequently, a petition for 
certiorari

was filed by defendants-appellants Alfredo Mesias and Candido Silao with the
Supreme Court assailing the denial of the motion and imputing the delay in the
filing of the motion for reconsideration to Ms. Alvarezâ misleading
instructions.â


The Court
Administrator directed Ms. Alvarez to comment on the allegations of
defendants-appellants Mesias and Silao.  Ms. Alvarez submitted her comment, which, in gist, states that there is
no truth to the allegation that she refused to accept the motion for
reconsideration and the postal money order slip; and that the advice given to
Ms. Cesar was to effect payment by postal money order considering that the case
on appeal was already dismissed by the court;  and, to attach the payment of the docket fee to the motion for
reconsideration.
[8]


A legal team was
sent by the Court Administrator to the Court of Appeals who interviewed Mr.
Buenaventura Miguel, Acting Chief, Judicial Records Section; and Atty. Elisa
Longalong, Assistant Clerk of Court, Court of Appeals.


The talk with
Mr. Buenaventura Miguel elicited the fact that Ms. Alvarez is a Utility Worker
assigned in the Docket Section and whose specific job is to index newly
appealed cases and arrange 
Rollo
s.  According to Miguel, while Ms. Alvarez is not a âfrontlinerâ in the
office, and, thus,  not in a position to
give instructions or advice to party-litigants, however, due to lack of
personnel, the Docket Section had to utilize anybody thereat to give advice to
party-litigants.


On the other
hand, Atty. Elisa Longalong gave the legal team an overview of the standard
operating procedure of the Court of Appeals relative to the filing of
pleadings, similar to that of the motion for reconsideration filed by Ms. Cesar.  Atty. Longalong said that the recourse
available to party-litigants in dismissed cases for failure to pay docket fee
is to first file a motion for reconsideration.  And, once the motion for reconsideration is granted, then that is the
time for the movant to pay the docket fee.


The two, Atty.
Longalong and Buenaventura Miguel, were of the opinion that probably the advice
given by Ms. Alvarez, as admitted in her comment, was well-meaning, she
presumably being of the belief that it would shorten the process, i.e., should
the motion for reconsideration be granted, then the intended payment for docket
fees sent by postal money order would have already been received by the
court.  However, Miguel and Atty.
Longalong were of the view that respondent probably was not in a position to
clearly explain to the complainant the necessity to first file with the
Receiving Section the motion for reconsideration of the resolution dismissing
the appeal for failure to pay docket fees.  Atty. Longalong gave the opinion that Ms. Alvarez should have referred
Ms. Cesar to the Receiving Section which has the ministerial duty of accepting
pleadings filed with the Court of Appeals irrespective of whether the same is
timely filed or not.


We have read the
record of the case, and we are in complete agreement with the finding of the
Court Administrator in his Memorandum, that:


âx x x.  While there is no evidence presented to
indicate bad faith or malice on the part of Ms. Alvarez, we nevertheless look
with disfavor on the practice in the Judicial Records Division of the Court of
Appeals of allowing a Utility Worker without any legal background or experience
to give advice to party-litigants involving policy or procedure with respect to
legal matters.


On the other
hand we wish to invite attention to the fact that it is incumbent upon counsel
for the appellants, who has the duty to protect the interests of their clients,
to see to it that their staff, charged with filing pleadings in court, are
knowledgeable or properly instructed on the matter.â
[9]


We further add
the following observations â


As admitted in
her Comment, Ms. Alvarez knew, as she ought to know, that she was not
authorized to receive motions and that the proper office therefor was the
Receiving Section of the Court of Appeals.  Instead of simply directing Cesar to the aforesaid office, she took it
upon herself to give improper advice knowing fully well that she had neither
the competence nor authority to do so.


While the acts
of Alvarez may not have been motivated by bad faith or malice, ordinary reason
and prudence should have prompted her to desist from giving suggestions or
advice, however well meant.  It is well
worth noting that messengers/agents of party-litigants tasked with the filing
of pleadings will ordinarily take as gospel truth and give due regard to
whatever advice is received from any court employee with some sort of apparent
authority.  Alvarez should have been
aware of this ostensible predisposition which could have guided her into being
more circumspect in her utterances.


The conduct and
behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of
justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be
circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.
[10]
 Every employee or officer involved
in the dispensation of justice should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of
responsibility and their conduct must at all times be above suspicion.
[11]
 


Mr. Buenaventura
Miguel, as Acting Chief of the Judicial Records Division, is responsible for the
acts of the personnel therein relative to the discharge of their duties.  Being head of the department, Miguel should
have exercised his control and supervision over subordinate employees as well
as his prerogative to implement work policies in such a manner as would avert
any appearance of impropriety and promote the speedy and efficient
administration of justice.  He has not
been meticulous and zealous as he should have been in organizing and
supervising the work of his subordinates as required by Canon 3, Rule 3.09 of
the Code of Judicial Conduct.
[12]
 


By his own
admission, he laid open the anomalous practice of allowing practically anybody
in their office to give advice to party-litigants.  His acquiescence and tolerance of such an arrangement has the propensity
to create confusion in the filing of pleadings in the Court of Appeals.


On the other
hand, the Court takes note of the apparent ineptitude of Ms. Cesar as shown by
her failed attempt to file the motion for reconsideration.  Party-litigants, counsels and their staff
are, therefore, cautioned to be more scrupulous and cognizant of the proper
procedure in the filing of pleadings.  The Court understands the frustration that litigants and lawyers alike,
would at times encounter in procedural bureaucracy, but imperative  justice  requires  proper observance of
indisputable technicalities precisely designed to ensure its proper
dispensation.
[13]


The Court
Administrator recommends that:


â1. Respondent Ms. Myrna Alvarez be
REPRIMANDED and WARNED not to meddle with the business transacted with the
office, especially when these pertain to matters outside the scope of her
assigned duties and responsibilities; otherwise a repetition of the same or
similar act will be dealt with more severely;


2. Mr. Buenaventura Miguel, Acting
Chief, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, be ADMONISHED for allowing
the personnel in the Division irrespective of their duties and function, to
deal with and give advice to party litigants on matters pertaining to cases
pending in the Court of Appeals; and, be DIRECTED to take the necessary steps
as well as to immediately correct such practice;


3. Clerk of Court Tessie Gatmaitan
as well as Assistant Clerk of Court Elisa Longalong, Court of Appeals be
DIRECTED to REMIND the Chiefs of Offices/Divisions and their personnel,
specially those offices with direct dealings with the public to be more prudent
in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities least the public they
vowed to serve be prejudiced; and


4. Atty.
Semproniano S. Ochoco be ADVISED to see to it that his staff charged with
filing of pleadings in court are knowledgeable and properly instructed on the
matter.â
[14]


We agree.

 pursuant to the recommendation of
the Court Administrator, the sanctions, as above recommended, are hereby
imposed upon the above-named employee and officials of the Court of Appeals.
