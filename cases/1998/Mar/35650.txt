6.  That  considering the fact that
the aforementioned minors by operation of law are to succeed to the entire

both minors and heirs of deceased Roberto Lim Chua, a guardian over the persons
and properties of said minors be appointed by this Honorable Court.


7.  That  herein petitioner  being  the  mother and natural guardian

CHUA and RUDYARD PRIDE ALONZO CHUA;


4.  That after all the property of deceased  Roberto  Lim  Chua have been inventoried and expenses and
just debts, have been paid, the intestate estate of Roberto Lim Chua be
distributed to  its rightful  heirs,  the  minors  in this case, pursuant to the provisions
of  Article 988 of the New Civil
Code  of  the Philippines.


5.  And for such other reliefs and remedies this Honorable Court may
consider fit and proper in the premises.


Cotabato
City, Philippines, June 29, 1992.


(Sgd.)
FLORITA ALONZO VALLEJO


(Petitioner)


The trial court
issued an order setting the hearing of the petition on 14 August 1992 and
directed that notice thereof be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the province of Maguindanao and Cotabato City and or Davao City.  


On 21 July 1992,
herein petitioner Antoinetta Garcia Vda. de Chua, representing to be the
surviving spouse of Roberto Chua,  filed
a Motion to Dismiss
[2]
 on  the  ground of improper
venue.  Petitioner alleged that at the
time of the decedent's death  Davao
City  was his residence, hence,  the Regional Trial Court of Davao City is
the proper forum.


Private  respondent  filed an opposition to the Motion to Dismiss
[3]
 dated July 20, 1992  based on the following grounds:


(1) That this petition is for the
guardianship of the minor children of the petitioner who are heirs to the
estate of the late Roberto L. Chua and under Section 1, Rule 92 of the Rules of
Court the venue shall be at the place where the minor resides;


(2)  That  the above-named  minors are residents of Cotabato City:


(3) That the movant in this case
has no personality to intervene nor to oppose in the granting of this petition
for the reason that she is a total stranger to the minors Robert Rafson Alonzo
and Rudyard Pride Alonzo, all surnamed Chua.


(4) That  deceased  Roberto L.
Chua  died a bachelor.  He is the father of  the above-named  minors  with  the  petitioner in this case;


(5)  That movant/oppositor Antoinetta Chua is not the surviving spouse
of the late Roberto L. Chua but  a  pretender to the estate of the latter since
the deceased never contracted marriage with any woman until he died.


On  6  August 1992, private respondent Vallejo filed a Motion for Admission of
an Amended Petition
[4]
 "in order that the designation
of the case title can properly and appropriately capture or capsulize in clear
terms the material averments in the body of  the  pleadings;  thus avoiding any confusion  or misconception of  the  nature and real  intent and
purpose  of this petition". The
amended petition
[5]
 contains  identical  material  allegations  but  differed in its title, thus:


IN RE:  PETITION  FOR  THE SETTLEMENT OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE  OF  ROBERTO  CHUA,  DECLARATION OF HEIRSHIP, GUARDIANSHIP OVER
THE PERSONS AND PROPERTIES OF MINORS ROBERT AND RUDYARD, all surnamed CHUA and
ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION.


FLORITA ALONZO VALLEJO,


Petitioner.


Paragraph 4 of
the original petition was also amended to read as follows: 


4.   That  Roberto  Lim Chua, father of the
abovementioned minors is a resident of Cotabato City  and died intestate on May 28, 1992 at Davao City.


The petition
contains exactly the same prayers as those in the original petitions.  


Petitioner
opposed the motion to amend petition alleging that at the hearing  of  said motion  on  24  July 1992, private respondentâs counsel allegedly admitted that the sole
intention of the original petition was to secure guardianship over the persons
an property of the minors. 
[6]


On 21, August
1992,  the trial  court issued an order
[7]
 denying the motion to dismiss for
lack of merit.  The court ruled that
Antoinetta Garcia had no personality to file the motion to  dismiss  not  having  proven  her  status as wife of the
decedent. Further, the court found that the actual residence of the deceased
was Cotabato City, and  even assuming
that there was concurrent venue among the Regional Trial Courts  where the decedent had resided, the R.T.C.
of Cotabato had already taken cognizance of the settlement of the decedent's
estate to the exclusion of all others.  The pertinent portions of the order read:


At  the  hearing of the motion to
dismiss on August 19, 1992, counsel for movant Antonietta G. Chua presented 18
Exhibits in  support  of her allegation that she was the lawful
wife of the decedent and that the latter resides in Davao City at the time of
his death.  Exh. â1â was the xerox copy
of the alleged marriage contract between the movant and the petitioner.  This cannot be admitted in evidence on the
ground of the timely objection of the counsels  for petitioner that the best evidence is the original copy or
authenticated  copy  which  the  movant  cannot produce.  Further, the counsels for petitioner in opposition  presented  the  following:  a  certification from the Local Civil Registrar concerned that no such
marriage contract was ever registered with them; a letter from Judge Augusto
Banzali,  the  alleged  person  to  have  solemnized  the  alleged 
marriage
that he has not solemnized such alleged marriage.  Exhibit â2â  through â18â
consist among others of Transfer Certificate  of  Title  issued in the name of Roberto L. Chua
married to Antonietta Garcia, and a resident of Davao City; Residence
Certificates  from  1988  and   1989 issued at Davao
City  indicating  that he was married and was born in Cotabato
City; Income Tax Returns for 1990 and 1991 filed in Davao City where the
status  of  the  decedent was stated
as married; passport of the decedent  specifying  that he  was  married  and his residence was Davao City.  Petitioner through counsels, objected  to  the admission  in  evidence  of Exhibits â2â through â18â  if  the  purpose is to establish the truth of the alleged marriage between
the decedent and Antonietta Garcia.  The best evidence they said is the marriage contract.  They do not object to the admission of said
exhibit if the purpose is to show that Davao City was the business residence of
the decedent.


Petitioner  through  counsels,  presented  Exhibit  âAâ through âKâ to support her allegation that the decedent was a
resident  of  Cotabato  City;  that  he  died a bachelor; that he
begot two illegitimate children with the petitioner as mother.  Among  these exhibits are Income Tax Returns filed in Cotabato City from  1968  through 1979 indicating therein that he was single; birth
certificates  of  the  alleged  two  illegitimate  children of the decedent; Resident Certificates of the decedent
issued in Cotabato City;  Registration  Certificate of  Vehicle  of the decedent showing that his residence is Cotabato City.


It is clear from the foregoing that
the movant failed to establish the truth of her allegation that she was  the  lawful  wife of the decedent.  The  best  evidence  is  a  valid marriage contract  which the movant failed to produce.  Transfer Certificates  of Title,  Residence  Certificates,  passports  and  other  similar documents cannot prove marriage
especially so when the petitioner has submitted a certification from the Local
Civil Registrar concerned that the alleged marriage was not registered  and a  letter  from the judge alleged to
have solemnized the marriage that  he  has  not solemnized said alleged marriage.  Consequently,  she has no
personality to file the subject motion to dismiss.


On the  issue  of the residence of
the decedent at the time of his death,  the  decedent as  a  businessman  has  many  business  residences from
different parts of  the country  where  he  usually  stays  to supervise  and  pursue his business ventures.  Davao City is one of them.  It cannot be denied that Cotabato  City  is his actual residence where his alleged illegitimate children also
reside.


The place of residence of the
deceased in settlement of estates, probate of will, and issuance of letters of
administration does not constitute an element of jurisdiction over the subject
matter.  It is merely constitutive of
venue (Fule vs. CA, L-40502, November 29, 1976).  Even assuming that there is concurrent venue among the Regional
Trial Courts of the places where the decedent has residences, the Regional
Trial Court first taking cognizance of the settlement of the estate of the
decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts
(Section 1, Rule 73).  It was this
Court which first took cognizance of the case when the petition was filed on
July 2, 1992, docketed as Special Proceeding No. 331 and an order of
publication issued by this Court on July 13, 1992.


WHEREFORE, in view of the
foregoing, the motion to dismiss is hereby denied for lack of merit.


On 31 August
1992, upon motion of  private
respondent,  the trial court issued an
order appointing Romulo Lim Uy, a first cousin of the deceased, as special
administrator of the decedent's estate.
[8]


On the same
day,  the trial court likewise issued an
Order appointing Florita Vallejo as the guardian over the persons and
properties of the two minor children.
[9]


Thereafter,
petitioner  filed a Motion dated 25
October 1993
[10]
 praying that the letters of
administration  issued to  Vallejo be recalled and that new letters of
administration be issued in her .  She,
likewise, filed a Motion dated 5 Novembeer 1993
[11]
 to declare the proceedings a
mistrial.  Both motions were denied by
the trial court in its Order dated 22 November 1993
[12]
  Petitionerâs motion  for  reconsideration of  the  order  was denied by the trial court in an order
dated 13 December 1993
[13]


Assailling the
last two orders of the trial court,  petitioner  filed a petition for
certiorari and prohibition (Rule 65) with the respondent Court of Appeals,
docketed as CA G.R. No. Sp. 33101, alleging  that  the trial court acted with
grave abuse of discretion in:


(1)  unilaterally and summarily converting, if not treating,  the  guardianship proceedings into an intestate proceeding;


(2) summarily hearing the intestate
proceedings without jurisdiction  and  without  any notice to herein petitioner whatsoever;
and


(3)  issuing the questioned order (sic) on the alleged pretension that
herein petitioner  has  no  personality  to intervene in SPL
Proc. No. 331 questioning the highly anomalous orders precipitately issued
ex-parte by the public respondent R.T.C. without notice to the petitioners.


Petitioner  in the main argued  that  private
respondent  herself  admitted in in her opposition to
petitionerâs motion to dismiss filed in the trial court and in open court  that  the original  petition she filed
is one for guardianship;  hence,
the  trial  court acted beyond its jurisdiction when it issued letters of
administration  over  the  estate of Robert C. Chua, thereby converting the petition into an
intestate proceeding, without the amended petition being published in a
newspaper  of  general  circulation  as  required by  Section 3, Rule 79.


The Court of
Appeals in its decision promulgated on 19 April 1994
[14]
 denied the petition ratiocinating
that the original petition filed was one for guardianship of the illegitimate
children of the deceased as well as for administration of his intestate
estate.  While private respondent may
have alleged  in her opposition to the
motion to dismiss that petition was for guardianship, the fact remains that the
very allegations of the original petition unmistakably  show  a twin  purpose:  (1) guardianship; and (2) issuance of
letters of administration.  As such, it
was unnecessary for her to republish the notice of hearing through a
newspaper  of  general circulation in the province. The amended petition was
filed for the only  reason stated in the
motion for leave: so that the the "case title can properly and appropriately
capture or capsulize in clear terms the material averments  in the body of the pleadings; thus avoiding
any confusion  or misconception of  the  nature  and  real intent and purpose of this
petition",  which  was  for  guardianship  over the persons and properties of her minor
children and for the settlement of the intestate estate of  the  decedent who  was  their  father.  In other words,  there being no change in  the  material  allegations  between  the original and amended petitions,  the  publication of the first in
a newspaper of general circulation sufficed for purposes of compliance with the
legal requirements of notice.


Moreover,  the  appellate  court ruled that the
petitioner's remedy is appeal  from  the orders complained  of  under
Section 1(f), Rule 109 of the Rules of Court, not certiorari and prohibition. 


Not  satisfied  with  the  decision  of  the Court of Appeals,
petitioner comes to  this  Court  contending  that the appellate
court committed the following errors:


I


THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT COURT OF
APPEALS GRAVELY AND SERIOUSLY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE ORIGINAL PETITION
(Annex F, Petition)  WAS  FOR  A TWIN PURPOSE, TO WIT:  FOR  GUARDIANSHIP  AND  FOR INTESTATE ESTATE PROCEEDINGS;


II


THE  PUBLIC  RESPONDENT COURT
OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN HOLDING  THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO  PUBLISH  THE AMENDED PETITION FOR
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE THEREBY CONTRAVENING  THE  RULES  OF COURT  AND  THE RULINGS OF THE SUPREME COURT


III


THE  PUBLIC  RESPONDENT COURT
OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY  ERRED  IN NOT NULLIFYING THE ORDERS (Annex âPâ to
âTâ)  PRECIPITATELY ISSUED  EX-PARTE  BY  THE  PUBLIC  RESPONDENT  REGIONAL  TRIAL COURT IN THE  INTESTATE  PROCEEDINGS  WITHOUT  PRIOR  HEARING OR NOTICE TO
HEREIN PETITIONER THEREBY DEPRIVING THE LATTER (ANTOINETTA GARCIA VDA. DE CHUA
) OF  DUE PROCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO BE
HEARD.


IV


THE PUBLIC
RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN SWEEPINGLY HOLDING THAT
PETITIONER'S REMEDY IS APPEAL.
[15]


In support of
her first assignment of errors,  petitioner
submits that the Court  of  Appealsâ  conclusion  that  the original petition was one for
guardianship and administration of the intestate estate is contradicted by the
evidence on hand, asserting that the original  petition failed to allege and state the jurisdictional facts required by
the Rules of Court in petitions for administration of a decedent's estate, such
as:  (a) the last actual residence of
the decedent at the time of his death; (b) names, ages and residences of the
heirs; and (c) the names and residences of the creditors of the decedent.  Petitioner also reiterates her argument
regarding private respondentâs alleged admission  that the original petition was one for guardianship and not for
issuance of  letters of  administration,  pointing  to the
Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss dated 20 July 1992, where the the private
respondent alleged:


1. That  this  petition  is for guardianship of
the minor children of the petitioner who are heirs to the estate of the late
Roberto L. Chua and under Section 1, Rule 92 of the Rules of Court the venue
shall be at the place where the minor resides.
[16]


As  well  as to  the  statements made by counsel for the private
respondent during the 24 July 1992 hearing on the motion to dismiss:


ATTY. RENDON:


We   filed  our  opposition to the motion to
dismiss the petition because 
this is a  petition  for guardianship of
minors, not for intestate proceedings
.  So this is a case where the mother wanted  to be appointed as guardian because she is also the litigant here.  Because whenever there is an intestate
proceedings,  she has to represent the
minors, and under the Rules of Court  in
any guardianship proceedings, the venue is at the place where the minor is
actually residing.
[17]
 


The petition is devoid of merit.


The title alone
of the original  petition clearly shows
that the petition is one which includes the issuance of letters of
administration.  The  title of said petition reads:


IN RE: PETITION
FOR DECLARATION OF HEIRSHIP, GUARDIANSHIP OVER THE PERSON AND PROPERTIES OF
MINORS  ROBERTO ALONZO AND RUDYARD
ALONZO, all surnamed CHUA 
and ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION.
[18]
 


Likewise, the prayer of the
petition states:


2.  That  Letters  of Administration be issued to herein
petition for the administration of the estate of the deceased ROBERTO LIM CHUA.



The original
petition also contains the jurisdictional facts required in  a petition for the issuance of letters of
administration.  Section 2, Rule 79 of
the Rules of Court reads:


Sec. 2.
  Contents  of petition  for  letters of administration - A petition  for  letters of administration
must be filed by an interested person and must show, so far as known to the
petitioner:


(a) jurisdictional facts;


(b) The names, ages, and residences
of the heirs and the names and residences of the creditors, of the decedent


(c) The probative value and
character of the property of the estate;


(d)  The  name  of  the  person for whom letters of
administration are prayed;
 


But no defect in the petition shall
render void the issuance of letters of administration.  (underscoring ours).


The
jurisdictional facts required in a petition for issuance of letters of
administration are: (1) the death of the testator; (2)  residence at the time of death in the
province where the probate court is located; and  (3)  if the  decedent was a non-resident, the fact of
being a resident of a foreign country and that the decedent has left an estate
in the province where the court is sitting.
[19]


While paragraph
4 of the original petition stating:


(4)  That  Roberto  Lim Chua, father of the above mentioned
minors,  died intestate on May 28, 1992
in Davao City.


failed to
indicate the residence of the deceased at the time of his death, the omission
was cured  by  the  amended petitions wherein
the same paragraph now reads:


(4)  That  Roberto  Lim Chua,  father  of  the abovementioned
minors  
is  a resident of Cotabato City
  and died  intestate on May 28,
1992 at Davao City.


[20]
 (Underscoring in the original.)


  All told the original petition alleged
substantially all the facts required to be  stated  in the petition for
letters of administration.  Consequently, there was no need to publish the amended petition as  petitioner  would  insist in her second
assignment of errors.


Be that as it may,
petitioner has no legal standing to file the motion to dismiss  as she is not related to the deceased,  nor  does she have any interest in his estate as creditor or otherwise.  The  Rules  are  explicit on who may do so:  


Sec. 4.
  Opposition
to petition for administration - Any interested person, may by filing a written
opposition, contest the petition on .the ground of incompetency of the person
for whom letters of  administration  are prayed therein,  or on the ground of the contestant's  own right to  the  administration,  and  may  pray  that letters issue to himself,  or to any competent person or persons named
in the opposition.


Only  an interested  person  may oppose the
petition for issuance of  letters of
administration.  An interested person
is one who would be benefited by the estate such as an heir,  or one who has a claim against the estate,
such as a creditor;  his interest  is  material  and direct, and not one
that is only indirect or contingent.
[21]


Petitioner was
not able to prove her status as the surviving wife of the decedent.  The best  proof of  marriage  between  man and  wife is  a  marriage contract which Antoinetta Chua failed to produce.  The lower court correctly disregarded  the  photostat  copy  of the marriage certificate which she
presented, this being a violation of the best evidence rule, together with
other worthless pieces of  evidence.  The trial court
correctly ruled in its 21 August 1992 Order that:


xxx Transfer
Certificates of Title, Residence Certificates, passports and other similar
documents cannot prove marriage especially  so  when  the petitioner has submitted a certification
from the Local Civil Registrar  concerned  that  the  alleged marriage was  not  registered  and  a letter from the judge
alleged to  have  solemnized  the  marriage  that he has not solemnized said alleged
marriage. xxx
[22]


Under her third
assignment of error, petitioner claims that the trial court issued its orders,
Annexes âPâ to âTâ  without  prior hearing or notice to her, thus,
depriving her of due process.


The orders
referred to by petitioner are:  Order
dated 31 August 1992 appointing  Romulo
Lim Uy, first cousin of the deceased, as special administrator of the estate;
Order dated 31 August 1992 appointing private respondent  as guardian  over the person and property of the minors; Order dated 5 August 1993,
directing  the  transfer  of the remains
of the deceased from Davao City to Cotabato City; Order dated 6 September 1993
directing petitioner to turn over a Mitsubishi Gallant car owned by the estate
of the deceased to the special administrator;  and Order dated 28 September 1993, authorizing the sheriff to break open
the deceasedâs house for the purpose of conducting an inventory of the
properties found therein, after the sheriff was refused entry to the house by
the driver and maid of petitioner.


Apart from the
fact that petitioner was not entitled to notice of the proceedings of the trial
court, not being able to establish proof of her alleged marriage to the decease,  or  of  her interest in the estate as
creditor or otherwise,  petitioner
categorically stated in the instant petition that on 25 October 1993 she filed
a motion praying for the recall of the letters of administration  issued  by  the  trial court  and  another  motion dated 5 August 1993  praying  that  the  proceedings conducted by the trial court be declared as a mistrial and
the court orders relative thereto be set aside and nullified.  Petitioner further stated that her motions
were denied by the trial court in its Order dated 22 November 21, 1993  and  that  on  30  November 1993 she filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of
denial which in turn was denied by the trial court on 13 December 1993.


Due  process  was  designed  to afford   opportunity to be heard, not that an  actual  hearing  should  always and indispensably be held.
[23]
 The  essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard. 
[24]
 Here,  even  granting that the
petitioner was not notified of the orders of the trial court marked as Exhibits
âPâ to âT,â inclusive,  nonetheless,  she  was  duly heard in her motions to  recall  letters  of  administration  and to declare
the proceedings of the court as a âmistrial,â which motions were denied in the
Order dated 22 November 1933.
[25]
 A motion for the reconsideration of
this order of denial was also duly heard by the trial court but was denied in
its Order of 13 December 1993.
[26]


Denial of due
process cannot  be  successfully  invoked by a party who has had the opportunity to be heard on his
motion for reconsideration.
[27]
 


As to the last
assignment of errors, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the proper remedy
of  the petitioner in said court
was  an ordinary appeal and not a
special civil action for  certiorari;  which  can  be availed of if a party has  no
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.  Except for her bare allegation that an
ordinary appeal would be inadequate, nothing on record would indicate that
extraordinary remedy of certiorari or prohibition is warranted.


Finally,  petitioner  further  argues as supplement to
her memorandum that  the  ruling  of  the  Court  of Appeals treating
the Special Proceeding No. 331 as one for both guardianship and  settlement of  estate  is  in contravention of our ruling in 
Gomez
vs. Imperial,
[28]
 which the petitioner quotes:


The distribution  of  the residue  of the estate of the
deceased  is  a  function  pertaining properly not to the guardianship
proceedings, but to another proceeding which the heirs are at liberty to
initiate.


Petitionerâs
reliance  on said case is
misplaced.  In  the 
Gomez
  case,  the action before
the lower court was merely one for guardianship.  Therefore said  court  did  not  have the  jurisdiction to distribute the estate of the
deceased.  While in the case at
bar, the petition filed before the court was both for guardianship and
settlement of estate.


IN VIEW OF
THE FOREGOING
,  the  petition of petitioner Antoinetta Chua is hereby denied.


SO ORDERED.
