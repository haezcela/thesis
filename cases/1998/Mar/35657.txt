PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALEX OLIANO Y PUGONG AND GABRIEL CALIAG, ACCUSED, ALEX
OLIANO Y PUGONG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

PANGANIBAN, J.:


Well-entrenched in
our jurisprudence is the rule that findings of trial courts on the credibility
of witnesses and their testimonies are binding on appellate courts, unless some
facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked,
misapprehended or misappreciated which, if considered, will affect the result
of the case.


The
Case


This is the
doctrine applied by the Court in resolving this appeal from the Decision 
1
 of the Regional Trial Court of
Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 30, finding Appellant Alex Oliano y Pugong
guilty of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua.


Provincial
Fiscal Celerino V. Jandoc filed an Information dated July 22, 1987 before the
said court, accusing appellant, together with one Gabriel Caliag, of murder,
allegedly committed as follows:


âThat on or about the 16th day of
March 1987, in the Municipality of Sta. Fe, Province of Nueva Vizcaya,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused Alex P. Oliano and Gabriel C. Caliag, conspiring,
confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously, by means of treachery and evident premeditation and
with intent to kill, attack and assault the person of Benjamin Matias by then and
there firing at him with the use of a gun, thereby inflicting upon him mortal
gunshot wounds, which were the direct and immediate cause of his death and all
to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs.


Contrary to law with the
aggravating circumstance of having used illegally possessed firearm in
committing the crime.â
2


On August 12,
1987, both accused were arraigned in the Kalanguya dialect which they spoke and
understood.  Assisted by Counsel Rufino
Lumase, both entered a plea of not guilty.
3
  In the
course of the trial which ensued, Gabriel Caliag died.
4
4  For this reason,  the  court a quo dismissed the  case against him.
5


On July 26,
1994, the lower court rendered its Decision,
6
 the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, finding the accused
ALEX OLIANO guilty of Murder defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the
Revised Penal Code, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion
perpetua; to pay the heirs of the victim Benjamin Matias the sum of P50,000.00;
P10,000.00 as actual damages; and P30,000.00 as moral damages.â
7


The appellant
filed a motion for reconsideration,
8
 which however was denied by the trial court in its
order dated September 15, 1994.
9
  Hence, this
appeal.

The Facts
Version of the Prosecution


The prosecution presented
six witnesses, namely:  (1) Nancy
Basatan,
11

a neighbor of the deceased; (2) Rosita Matias,
12
 the widow; (3) PFCs Samuel Caramat
13
 and (4) Bernabe Flores,
14
 the investigating and arresting
officers;  (5) Myrna Matias,
15
 the daughter of the victim; and (6)
Dra. Violeta Rumbaua,
16
 who conducted the autopsy.  The antecedent facts, culled from the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses, were briefly summarized by the solicitor general as
follows:


âOn March 16, 1987, Benjamin Matias
and his wife, Rosita, attended the wedding of Helen Nebres and Hilario Bugan in
the house of Hindok Nebres at Sitio Taktak, Barangay Atbo, Sta. Fe, Nueva
Vizcaya.  Among those who attended the
wedding were accused Gabriel Caliag and Alex Oliano.  While serving supper, Rosita heard Alex say âIf it is Benjamin
Matias who will give meat, I will not accept it.â Benjamin Matias was then busy
slicing meat for the guests.  At about
11:45 that evening, Rosita and Benjamin went home.  The distance of their house from that of the Nebresâ was about
one-half kilometer.  Benjamin walked
ahead of Rosita. (x x x)


It happened that there were two
boulders located on the left side of the road leading to the coupleâs
house.  When they were only about a
meter away from the boulders, somebody fired a gun at Benjamin hitting him at
the back, the bullet exiting through his chest.  Rosita then saw appellant Alex Oliano behind the boulders,
holding a rifle.  At that instance,
Rosita uttered the following to appellant:  âWhy did you kill my husband when in fact, he did not commit any fault
against you?â  Subsequently, appellant
aimed his gun at her but it jammed.  Rosita also saw the other accused Gabriel Caliag looking at her from
behind a banana plant.  Alex and Gabriel
then ran away towards the mountain.  Rosita went to her husband who was then lying face down on the ground
and embraced him.  The moon was bright
that night, thus enabling Rosita to easily recognize appellant and his
co-accused.  Rosita is also familiar
with appellant since he was 17 years old because they were neighbors. (x x x)


Rosita called for help and her
neighbor, Nancy Basatan came.  The
latter asked Rosita what happened.  Rosita answered, âAlex Oliano shot my husband when we did not have any
fault against him.â  Later, her children,
namely Ricardo, Edgar, and Dencio arrived together with two Barangay Captains
Day-an Celo and Peter.  Her children
wanted to retaliate against Alex but she calmed them down.  Several policemen also arrived and she
explained to them how the incident happened.  Station Commander Mariano Amlos then formed two groups of policemen,
whom he directed to go to the houses of appellant and Caliag.  Moments later, Bay-an Basatan arrived and
told Rosita to go to his house.  Rosita
went to his house and there saw both appellant and Gabriel Caliag.  Upon seeing appellant, she grabbed his
collar and said âYou were the one who killed my husband.â  Appellant cried and replied, âYou are even attending
mass.â  Caliag, on the other hand,
looked happy, and even played the guitar.  Both of them were then brought to the police station in Sta. Fe, Nueva
Vizcaya. (x x x)â

Version of the Defense


The defense
presented Accused Gabriel Caliag
20
 and Appellant Alex Oliano
21
 as main witnesses. In his Brief
dated November 29, 1995, appellant adopted the trial courtâs summary of the
testimony of the defense witnesses, viz.:


âx x x.  On March 16, 1987 at 10:00 A.M., he was at Tactac, Sta. Fe, Nueva
Vizcaya to deliver rattan to a buyer.  Then he went to Ocao to attend the wedding celebration and stayed there
for more than 5 hours.  He left the
wedding at about 11:00 in the evening together with his father, mother, sister
and students of Kalahan Academy and proceeded to the house of his father Ramon
Oliano at Mancate, which is about 1/2 kilometer from the wedding celebration
and arrived thereat 11:30 in the evening, then he slept on a folding bed in the
corner of the house.  At 2:00 in the
morning, he was awakened by the policemen of Sta. Fe.  Sgt. Amlos removed his blanket and awakened him and he wanted to
talk to him.  When he woke up, he saw
Petra, Delia Paraguas and his mother sitted [sic] on a bench.  Sgt. Amlos told him about the death of
Benjamin Matias at Mancate and asked him as to who are his companions in coming
from the wedding celebration and he told the police that his companion is a
person named Benito.  The policemen
invited him to go with them but he intended not to go but his father advised
him to go with them, so they proceeded to the house of Pay-an Basatan about 600
meters away.  Later on, Rosita Matias
and some policemen arrived.  Gabriel
Caliag was also there sitted [sic] in a chair.  Rosita Matias pointed to them as the killers of her husband. Later on,
the two accused together with the  policemen went to Sta. Fe and the accused were locked in jail for two
hours.  Then they were brought to the
PNP Crime Laboratory, Echague, Isabela for paraffin examination.  After the examination, the policemen
returned them to Sta. Fe; that it is not true that they killed Benjamin Matias.

x x.â


âDELBERT RICE, a Pastor of the
Christian Kalahan Parish, testified that he had personally known the two
accused for 25 years because they are his students in the Kalahan Academy; that
he also knows the victim being a member of their congregation in Mancate and
his compadre; that on March 16, 1987, he attended the wedding of Helen Nobres
and Hilario Bugan at barangay Atbo with several other persons.  The two accused were also there, so with
victim; that he stayed there up to 4:00 P.M., then he went to Sta. Fe because
he had visitors from Manila; that accused Gabriel Caliag is a Lay Pastor of
Kalahan Parish serving in Mancate; that on the night of March 16, 1987, he went
home at Imugan; early morning of the following day, he was informed that
Benjamin Matias was shot dead and the two accused Gabriel Caliag and Alex
Oliano were arrested.  He was requested
to bring the deceased to Bambang Hospital for autopsy examination and the
accused were brought to PNP Crime Laboratory, Echague, Isabela for paraffin
test.  After a month, he happened to
pass thru Echague, Isabela and dropped at the PC Crime Laboratory and received
xerox copies of the request of Sta. Fe PNP for paraffin examination; receipt of
the request and the report of the paraffin examination marked as Exhs. â1â,
â1-Bâ and â1-Câ;that the paraffin examination gave negative results; that
Gabriel Caliag has a visual problem and he brought him to Dr. Tamesis,
President of the Philippines Medical Society for medical examination and he
found out that the retina of his eyes are defective; that said accused returned
to Dr. Tamesis and secured a medical report (Exh. â2â); that Pastor Rice
conducted ocular inspection of the place where the incident happened and he
could hardly see a person behind the boulders; and that it was full moon when
the crime was committed and the night was bright because of the light from the
moon.


RAMON OLIANO, testified that he is
62 years old and a resident of Mancate, Villaflores, Sta. Fe, Nueva Viscaya;
that on March 16, 1987, he attended the wedding at Atbo and arrived there at
10:00 A.M. and saw his son Alex Oliano at 3:00 P.M. in the wedding.  He also saw Gabriel Caliag there.  He left the wedding celebration and went
home at about 11:00 in the evening with Delia Paraguas, Alex Oliano and several
persons from Kalinga-Apayao.  When they
arrived at home, he slept.  Later on, he
was awakened by the policemen of Sta Fe because they wanted to talk to his son
Alex Oliano.  Alex was then sleeping at
that time and Sgt. Amlos who was allowed to enter the house allegedly shook
Alex and removed his blanket.  The
policemen took his son with them at the Police Station at Sta. Fe and he
continued sleeping.  On the following
day, he followed his son at the Police Station; that he knows Gabriel Caliag
who is a Pastor of the United Church of Christ of the Philippines and that he
also knows the victim Benjamin Matias.


On cross-examination, he further
testified that it was accused Gabriel Caliag who requested him as a witness in
this case and not his son Alex; that he learned from Delia Paraguas that his
visitors on that night are from Kalinga-Apayao; that he was awakened in his
sleep when the policemen knocked at the door of his house but he didnât know
what time it was; and that the policemen needed his son Alex because he is one
of the suspects in the death of Benjamin Matias.â 
22


To prove that he
did not use a firearm during the commission of the crime, Oliano presented the
result of a paraffin test  showing that
there was no gunpowder residue (nitrates) on his hands.
23
 


Ruling
of the Trial Court


In convicting
Oliano of murder, the trial court gave credence to the testimony of the widow,
Rosita Matias, who positively identified Oliano as the perpetrator.  It also held that she could not have been
mistaken for the following reasons: first, there was light coming from the moon
during the incident; second, the appellant had been her neighbor for a long
time; lastly, there was no showing that the widow had a sinister motive to
falsely accuse Oliano of a serious crime if it were not the truth.  Moreover, the trial court held that her
narration in court was corroborated by Basatan, as well as by PFCs Caramat and
Flores.  It also held that the killing
was qualified by treachery.


Assignment
of Error


Appellant
imputes this sole error to the trial court:


âThe trial court seriously erred in
finding the Appellant Alex Oliano guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime
of murder.â
24


The defense argues that Rosita
Matias was a biased witness who was âpreconditionedâ
25
 to name Appellant Oliano as the culprit.  Appellant seeks to discredit Rositaâs testimony under the rubric
of âpsychological predisposition,â
26
 by which âpast experiences or situations may act as stimuli
that preconditions [sic] the mind and body to think and act in a particular
way.â
27
  In the
present case, the stimuli were the remarks made by the appellant against her
husband in the presence of other people, which she deemed insulting.  Appellant then avers that âon [sic] that
fateful moment of the shooting of Benjamin Matias, there was no name most
convenient to recall but that of Alex Oliano, the same man who, hours before
the incident, had slighted Rosita Matiasâ feelings and whose actuations remained
fresh in her thoughts.  In so doing,
Rosita has consoled herself from the pain of death and vindicated the crime
committed against her husband and her family.â
28
 


Appellant also
maintains that the widowâs testimony was incredible because she averred that,
instead of rendering aid to her fallen husband or seeking refuge, she
approached the killer.  Appellant also
questions the sufficiency of the illumination from the moon which allegedly
enabled Mrs. Matias to identify the assailant.


This
Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
not meritorious.


Credibility
of Witnesses


The assessment
of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best
undertaken by the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the
witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude.  Findings of the trial court on such matters
are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless some facts or
circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or
misinterpreted.
29
  In the
present case, the trial court gave credence to Rositaâs testimony.  Appellant failed to present any compelling
reason â and we find none --  to
overturn the findings of the court a quo.  


Improper
Motive


Shorn of its psychological
jargon, appellantâs main argument seeks to impute improper motive to the
prosecution eyewitness.  In simple  language, appellant argues that this Court
should not believe Rosita because she had a motive to testify falsely against
appellant.  We are not persuaded.  The existence of an ill motive does not
automatically render a testimony false or unbelievable.  Moreover,  the alleged motive -- to avenge the slight perpetrated against her
husband â is too paltry a cause for any person to testify falsely against
another and cause his incarceration for the most part of his life.  Indeed, appellant failed to overcome the
presumption that Rosita was not actuated by improper motive, and that her
testimony was entitled to full faith and credence.
30


Additionally,
the fact that Rosita was the wife of the deceased, far from rendering her
testimony biased, makes it even more credible, for it is unnatural for a
relative who is interested in vindicating the crime, to accuse somebody other
than the real culprit.  For her to do so
is to let the guilty go free.
31


Rosita testified
as follows:


âQ
   
While
you were walking towards your house with your husband ahead of you, as you have
just stated, what tra(n)spired next, if anything?


A
    
While
we were walking on the trail with my husband, I heard one gunshot, sir.


Q
    
When
you heard this gunshot, what transpired next, if anything?


A
    
When
I saw the big boulders, I saw ALEX OLIANO there, sir.


Q
    
This
gunshot which you heard, where did it come from?


A
    
It
came from the left, at the foot of the boulder, sir.


      
xxx
     
xxx
     
xxx


Q
    
And
when you heard the shot which according to you came from a big boulder stone,
what did you do, if anything?


A
    
Upon
hearing the gunshot, I shouted and uttered the following, âWHY DID YOU KILL MY
HUSBAND WHEN INFACT [sic] HE DID NOT COMMIT ANY FAULT AGAINST YOUâ.


Q
    
To
whom did you direct those words?


A
    
ALEX
OLIANO, sir.

xxx
                              
xxx


Q
    
Please
describe to the court what you saw?


A
    
He
was holding his gun in this position (Witness demonstrating).

Q
    
After
the 2 persons, GABRIEL CALIAG & ALEX OLIANO run [sic] away, what did you do
next, if anything?


A
    
What
I did, I went and embraced my husband because he was then lying, facing the
ground, sir.


Q
    
What
did you observe when you went to succor of your husband?


A
    
When
I carried him up or lifted him, incidentally, the portion which I touched of
his body was then the very portion where he was wounded, sir.


Q
    
Please
point out where you saw the wound at your own body?


A
    
What
I saw the wound or bullet entered in this portion (witness indicating a portion
of her left back) and exited here (Witness indicating a portion of her right
forearms). sir.

Q
    
Considering,
Madam Witness, before I proceed further, considering that it was night time,
will you please inform the court why you were able to see GABRIEL CALIAG and
ALEX OLIANO on that night when your husband was shot?


A
    
There
was a moonlight, sir.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


Q
    
You
said that it was through the light of the moon you were able to recognize ALEX
OLIANO & GABRIEL CALIAG, were you able to describe the moon during that
night?


A
    
Yes,
sir, because during that night, I look[ed] up on the sky and it was clear and
no clouds and the moon was bright, sir.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxxâ
32


During cross-examination, the widow
was even more specific in recounting the incident, as follows:


âQ
   
And
according to your testimony a while ago, your husband was ahead of you of about
more than 6-feet, is it not?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
because he was 6-feet ahead of you, so, he would already pass those boulders
when the shot rang out?


A
    
Yes,
sir.  He made 3 steps before he fell
down.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


Q
    
And
when you saw your husband staggered 3 steps forward of you, you did not
immediately go to him or help him but rather you concentrate or focus your
attention to where the shot came, is that correct, Madam Witness?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
So,
at that moment and time, you were more interested where the shot came rather
than go and assist your husband which is the natural thing for a wife to do at
that moment?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
You
did not care anymore whether your husband who was staggering forward and
falling down needs assistance but rather you better look at the direction where
the shot came from?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
That
is rather unusual conduct on your part, Madam Witness, is it not?


A
    
After
I saw Alex Oliano, I attended to my husband.


Q
    
Now,
when the shot rang out, you turned to your left and then look at the boulder,
is that correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


Q
    
Now,
Madam Witness, when you look at the boulder, you mentioned that you saw Alex
Oliano, is that correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
from where you were standing, he is directly in front of you, correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
when you first spotted him, he was not moving, is it not?


A
    
He
was looking at me.


Q
    
He
was not moving?


A
    
No,
sir.


Q
    
And
from where you were standing directly facing him and holding a gun, that gun
was also directly pointed at you when you first saw him, correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


Q
    
From
your demonstration, what you can see from where you were standing were [sic]
only the barrel of the gun, you cannot see anymore the size of the gun, is it
not?


A
    
I
can see the whole because it was only a short firearm.


Q
    
When
you spotted this Alex Oliano, you said that he was Â½ chin beside/behind the
small boulder, is that correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


Q
    
And
you can only see him up to the chin.  The rest of the body was hidden by the boulder, is it not?


A
    
I
[c]an see the whole body and he was seated.


Q
    
And
in front of Alex Oliano is a stone, is that correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Therefore,
the stone hides the lower portion of the body of the accused?


A
    
No,
sir.  Because on the 2 boulders, one is
bigger and the other one is smaller.  He
was sitting on that place and I intentionally looked at him, that is why I saw
his entire body.


COURT:


Q
    
You
said before that the pathway which you were walking in going home is much lower
than the base of the boulder you have been saying?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
Alex Oliano was crawling  behind one of
the boulders?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Now,
you claimed that you saw the entire body of Alex Oliano?


A
    
Yes,
sir.  Because I peeped at him.  [Witness demonstrating by putting her two
(2) hands on top of the enclosure of the witness stand.]


Q
    
When
you said you saw Alex Oliano, you approached him?


A
    
Yes,
sir.  I approached him, then I shouted
at him and asked him why he shot my husband when in fact he had no fault
committed.


Q
    
How
near were you when you approached him?


A
    
Near.  From this place up to that place or 6-feet.


Q
    
How
wide is that boulder between you?


A
    
It
is appearing in the picture if you wish to see it.


Q
    
When
you approached him, your body was immediately being pointed or being touched by
the back of the gun?


A
    
No
sir.  Because when I approached him, I
do this way. [Witness put her two (2) hands on top of the enclosure of the
witness stand.)  After which, I shouted
at him and asked him why he shot my husband when he did not commit any fault on
him.


Q
    
Naturally,
you went to climb to Alex Oliano because the stone aside from its elevated base
is also quite high.


A
    
I
did not climb anymore because the elevation where the boulder was resting is
only this high.  [(]Witness indicating
the height.[)]  And so, I was able to
see him.

The foregoing
testimony clearly shows that Rosita was present at the locus of the crime, and
that she was able to identify the appellant as the assailant.  The details of the incident were narrated in
such a simple, candid and straightforward manner,
34
  that they could not have been fabricated or concocted.


Moreover, said
testimony was corroborated on material points by the testimonies of other
witnesses.  Prosecution Witness Nancy
Basatan averred that she heard a gunshot, followed by  the cries of  Rosita   Matias.  


She and her
husband then rushed to the succor of Rosita and the victim.  She further testified that Rosita, while
inside their house immediately thereafter, told them that Oliano was the felon.  PFCs Samuel Caramat and Bernabe Flores also
supported Rositaâs testimony; just after the incident, they heard Rositaâs
insistent declarations that Oliano was the killer. 


Furthermore,
credence should be given to Rositaâs account because the medical findings
support it.
35
  Rosita
testified that their assailant fired at them from an elevated position.  On the witness stand, Dr. Violeta Rumbaua
concurred:


âFISCAL:


Q
    
What
could have been the probable position of the victim Benjamin Matias at the time
of the infliction of the wounds?


A
    
The
victim might have been positioned in front and slightly to the right of the
assailant, sir.


Q
    
What
could have been the probable position of the gunman to the victim?


A
    
The
back of the victim is towards the assailant, sir.


FISCAL:


Q
    
Now
doctor, based on your findings, what could have been the probable position of
the assailant when he shot the victim?


A
    
The
assailant might have been in the position which is higher in elevation than the
victim, sir.


Q
    
What
do you mean higher in elevation?


A
    
What
I mean is that, the assailant is positioned slightly in lingher [sic] portion
that the victim, sir.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


COURT:


Q
    
How
did you arrive to [sic] that conclusion doctor?


A
    
I
based it on the trajectory of the bullets, sir.â
36


Testimony
of Rosita Matias Credible


Appellant
asserts that it was incredible that Rosita, who was just shot at and whose
companion was dying on the ground, would approach the assailant instead of
seeking refuge.  It has been held that
persons confronted with a strange, startling, or frightful experience have no
standard behavioral response.
37
.  Different
people react differently to a particular event.  What may not seem normal to a person in one circumstance may be
perfectly normal to another confronted with the same startling incident.
38
  Hence, the fact that Rositaâs reaction does not seem natural to some
does not destroy her credibility.


Lack
of Sufficient Illumination


Appellant also
argues that Rosita could not have seen the killer because the crime was
committed at nighttime.  He also
discredits the testimony that the moon was full on March 16, 1987 when the
crime was committed, stating that the calendar presented during the trial
showed that the full moon fell on March 15, 1987. 


It is scarcely
necessary to address this puerile argument.  Rosita testified that she was able to identify the appellant because of
the illumination from the moon.  Nancy
Basatan,
39

Samuel Caramat,
40
 Delbert Rice
41
 and Gabriel Callag
42
 also affirmed that the moon was
bright that night.  In People vs. Gamboa
43
 and People vs. Pueblas,
44
 this Court ruled that illumination
from the moon is sufficient for a person to identify another.
45
  We find pointless appellantâs disquisition on whether the moon was full
that night.  Indeed,  this argument is immaterial.  Visibility at nighttime is possible not only
at the exact minute and date when the moon is full as indicated in the
calendar.  In the same way, the
nocturnal vision of a person is not necessarily impaired just because the full
moon is one day early or late.  


Negative
Result of the Paraffin Test


The results of
the paraffin test do not exculpate appellant.  It has been held that the negative findings of the said test do not
conclusively show that he did not discharge a firearm at the time the crime was
committed.  The absence of nitrates is possible
if a person discharged a firearm with gloves on, or if he thoroughly washed his
hands thereafter.
46


Denial
and Alibi Unacceptable


Appellant denied
any participation in the killing of Matias, contending that he was, at the
time, sleeping  in the house of his
father.  This is bereft of merit.  For alibi to prosper,  it must be shown that it was physically
impossible for the appellant to have been at the scene of the crime at the time
of its commission.  In this case, the
locus of the crime was only a half kilometer away from the house of appellantâs
father.  In any event, we cannot accord
credence to this defense in the face of the credible and positive
identification made by Rosita Matias. 


Treachery


We agree with
the trial court that the killing was qualified by treachery.  The essence of treachery is a swift and
unexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the
part of the victim.
47
  In this
case, the victim, totally unaware of his impending death, was walking with his
wife when he was shot.  He had no weapon
with which to defend himself.  He had
not provoked the appellant; he had no previous altercation or serious
misunderstanding with him.  These
constitute alevosia or treachery
48
 qualifying the killing to murder.


While the
information charged that the killing was also aggravated by evident
premeditation and use of illegally possessed firearms, the trial court judge
did not appreciate these circumstances.  The records support his stance.  The prosecution failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the
killing was attended by these circumstances.  Likewise,  we cannot appreciate
the generic aggravating circumstance of nighttime;  while the crime was committed at night, the prosecution failed to
show that the appellant sought this circumstance to facilitate the criminal
design.
49


The penalty for
murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code
50
 is reclusion temporal in its
maximum period to death.  There being no
attendant aggravating or mitigating circumstances clearly established during
the trial, the mid-range penalty of reclusion perpetua should be imposed upon
the appellant.


Damages


The lower court
ordered Oliano to pay the heirs of Benjamin Matias the following amounts:
P50,000.00 (stating no reason for the award); P10,000.00 as actual damages and
P30,000.00 as moral damages.


Consistent with
prevailing jurisprudence, we award P50,000.00 to the heirs of Benjamin Matias
as indemnity for his untimely demise.
51


We cannot,
however, sustain the award of actual damages.  To seek recovery of  actual
damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable
degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence
obtainable by the injured party.
52
  In this
case, we find no such proof to sustain the award of actual damages.  The prosecution merely presented a bond
paper containing a list of the expenses allegedly incurred from the killing to
the burial of Benjamin Matias.  They did
not present any receipt or other evidence to support the claim.
53
  Nonetheless, appellant should pay the heirs of the deceased temperate
damages in the amount of P10,000.  Under
Article 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages âmay be recovered when the
court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot,
from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty.â


Moral damages
may be awarded if there is proof of âphysical suffering, mental anguish,
fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social
humiliation, and similar injury.â
54
  The
prosecution witnesses failed to present proof of any of these
circumstances.  Hence, we cannot affirm
such award by the trial court.


WHEREFORE, the assailed
Decision is AFFIRMED but the award of actual and moral damages is DELETED.
Appellant is ORDERED to pay the heirs of the deceased P50,000 as civil
indemnity and P10,000 as temperate damages.  Costs against appellant.


SO ORDERED.
