[ G.R. No. 101387, March 11, 1998 ]


SPOUSES MARIANO AND ERLINDA
LABURADA, REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, MANUEL SANTOS, JR., PETITIONERS,
VS. LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J:


In an original land
registration proceeding in which applicants have been adjudged to have a
registrable title, may the Land Registration Authority (LRA) refuse to issue a
decree of registration if it has evidence that the subject land may already be
included in an existing Torrens certificate of title?  Under this circumstance, may the LRA be compelled by mandamus to
issue such decree?


The Case


These are the
questions confronting this Court in this special civil action for mandamus
[1]
 under Rule 65 which asks this Court
to direct the Land Registration Authority (LRA) to issue the corresponding
decree of registration in Land Registration Case (LRC) No. N-11022.
[2]


The Facts


Petitioners were
the applicants in LRC Case No. N-11022 for the registration of Lot 3-A,
Psd-1372, located in Mandaluyong City.  On January 8, 1991, the trial court, acting as a land registration
court, rendered its decision disposing thus:
[3]


âWHEREFORE, finding the application
meritorious and it appearing that the applicants, Spouses Marciano [sic] and
Erlinda Laburada, have a registrable title over the parcel of land described as
Lot 3A, Psd-1372, the Court declares, confirms and orders the registration of
their title thereto.


As soon as this decision shall
become final, let the corresponding decree be issued in the name of spouses
Marciano [sic] and Erlinda Laburada, both of legal age, married, with residence
and postal address at No. 880 Rizal Ave., Manila.â


After the
finality of the decision, the trial court, upon motion of petitioners, issued
an order
[4]
 dated March 15, 1991 requiring the
LRA to issue the corresponding decree of registration.  However, the LRA refused.  Hence, petitioners filed this action for
mandamus.
[5]


Attached to the
LRAâs comment on the petition is a report dated April 29, 1992 signed by
Silverio G. Perez, director of the LRA Department of Registration, which
explained public respondentâs refusal to issue the said decree:
[6]


âIn connection with the Petition
for Mandamus filed by Petitioners through counsel, dated August 27, 1991
relative to the above-noted case/record, the following comments are
respectfully submitted:


On March 6, 1990, an application
for registration of title of a parcel of land, Lot 3-A of the subdivision plan
Psd-1372, a portion of Lot 3, Block No. 159, Swo-7237, situated in the
Municipality of San Felipe Neri, Province of Rizal was filed by Spouses
Marciano [sic] Laburada and Erlinda Laburada;


After plotting the aforesaid plan
sought to be registered in our Municipal Index Sheet, it was found that it
might be a portion of the parcels of land decreed in Court of Land Registration
(CLR) Case Nos. 699, 875 and 817, as per plotting of the subdivision plan (LRC)
Psd-319932, a copy of said subdivision plan is Annex âAâ hereof;


The records on file in this
Authority show that CLR Case Nos. 699, 875 & 917 were issued Decree Nos.
240, 696 and 1425 on August 25, 1904, September 14, 1905 and April 26, 1905,
respectively;


On May 23, 1991, a letter of this
Authority was sent to the Register of Deeds, Pasig, Metro Manila, a copy is
Annex âBâ hereof, requesting for a certified true copy of the Original
Certificate of Title No. 355, issued in the name of Compania Agricola de
Ultramar;


On May 20, 1991, a certified true
copy of the Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 355 was received by this
Authority, a copy is Annex âCâ hereof, per unsigned letter of the Register of
Deeds of Pasig, Metro Manila, a copy is Annex âDâ hereof;


After examining the furnished OCT
NO. 355, it was found that the technical description of the parcel of land
described therein is not readable, that prompted this Authority to send another
letter dated April 15, 1992 to the Register of Deeds of Pasig, Metro Manila, a
copy is Annex âEâ hereof, requesting for a certified typewritten copy of OCT
No. 355, or in lieu thereof a certified copy of the subsisting certificate of
title with complete technical description of the parcel of land involved
therein.  To date, however, no reply to
our letter has as yet been received by this Authority;


After verification of the records
on file in the Register of Deeds for the Province of Rizal, it was found that
Lot 3-B of the subdivision plan Psd-1372 being a portion of Lot No. 3, Block
No. 159, Plan S.W.O. -7237, is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No.
29337 issued in the name of Pura Escurdia Vda. de Buenaflor, a copy is attached
as Annex âFâ hereof. Said TCT No. 29337 is a transfer from Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 6595.  However, the title
issued for Lot 3-A of the subdivision plan Psd-1372 cannot be located because
TCT No. 6595 consisting of several sheets are [sic] incomplete.


For this Authority to issue the
corresponding decree of registration sought by the petitioners pursuant to the
Decision dated January 8, 1991 and Order dated March 15, 1991, it would result
in the duplication of titles over the same parcel of land, and thus contravene
the policy and purpose of the Torrens registration system, and destroy the
integrity of the same (G.R. No. 63189, Pedro E. San Jose vs. Hon. Eutropio
MigriÃ±o, et al.,); x x x.â


In view of the
foregoing explanation, the solicitor general prays that the petition be
dismissed for being premature.


After the filing
of memoranda by the parties, petitioners filed an urgent motion, dated
September 4, 1995,
[7]
 for an early resolution of the
case.  To this motion, the Court
responded with a Resolution, dated October 23, 1995, which ordered:
[8]


âx x x Acting on the urgent motion
for early resolution of the case dated 04 September 1995 filed by petitioner
Erlinda Laburada herself, the Court resolved to require the Solicitor General
to report to the Court in detail, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this
Resolution, what concrete and specific steps, if any, have been taken by
respondent since 19 May 1993 (the date of respondentâs Memorandum) to actually
verify whether the lot subject of LRC Case No. N-11022 (Regional Trial Court of
Pasig, Branch 68), described as Lot 3A, Psd-1372 and situated in Mandaluyong
City, might be a portion of the parcels of land decreed in Court of Land
Registration Case (CLR) Nos. 699, 875 and 917.â


On December 29,
1995, the solicitor general submitted his compliance  with  the  above  resolution,  to  which  was attached a letter dated November 27, 1997 of Felino M. Cortez, chief
of the LRA Ordinary and Cadastral Decree Division, which states:
[9]


âWith reference
to your letter dated November 13, 1995, enclosed herewith is a copy of our
letter dated 29 April 1992 addressed to Hon. Ramon S. Desuasido stating among
others that Lot 3-B, of the subdivision plan Psd-1372, a portion of Lot 3, Blk.
159, Swo-7237 is really covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 29337
issued in the name of Pura Escurdia Vda. de Bunaflor [sic] which was
transfer[ed] from Transfer Certificate of Title No. 6395, per verification of
the records on file in the Register of Deeds of Rizal.  However, the title issued for the subject
lot, Lot 3-A of the subdivision plan Psd-1372, cannot be located because TCT
#6595 is incomplete.


It was also
informed [sic] that for this Authority to issue the corresponding decree of
registration sought by the petitioners pursuant to the decision dated January
9, 1991 and order dated March 15, 1991, would result in the duplication of
[the] title over the same parcel of land, and thus contravene the policy and
purposes of the torrens registration system, and destroy the integrity of the
same (O.R. No. 63189 Pedro K. San Jose vs. Hon. Eutropio MigriÃ±o, et. al.).


Hence, this case
will be submitted to the Court for dismissal to avoid duplication of title over
the same parcel of land.â


Issue


Petitioners
submit this lone issue:
[10]


âWhether or not Respondent Land
Registration Authority can be compelled to issue the corresponding decree in
LRC Case No. N-11022 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Branch LXVIII (68).â


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
not meritorious.


Sole Issue:  
Is Mandamus the Right Remedy?


Petitioners
contend that mandamus is available in this case, for the LRA âunlawfully
neglect[ed] the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a
duty resulting from an office x x x.â  They cite four reasons why the writ should be issued.  
First, 
petitioners claim that they
have a âclear legal right to the act being prayed for and the LRA has the
imperative duty to performâ because, as land registration is an 
in rem 
proceeding,
the âjurisdictional requirement of notices and publication should be complied
with.â
[11]
 Since there was no showing that the
LRA filed an opposition in this proceeding, it cannot refuse to issue the
corresponding decree.  
Second, 
it
is not the duty of the LRA to âtake the cudgels  for the private persons in possession of OCT No. 355, TCT No.
29337 snf [sic] TCT No. 6595.â  Rather,
it is the âsole concern of said private person-holders of said titles to
institute in a separate but proper action whatever claim they may have against
the property subject of petitionersâ application for registration.â  
Third, 
petitioners contend that they
suffered from the delay in the issuance of their title, because of âthe failure
of the Register of Deeds of Pasig, Metro Manila to furnish LRA of [sic] the
certified copies of TCT No. 29337 and TCT No. 6595â notwithstanding the lack of
opposition from the holders of said titles.
[12]
 
Fourth, 
the State âconsented
to its being suedâ in this case[;] thus, the legislature must recognize any
judgment that may be rendered in this case âas final and make provision for its
satisfaction.â
[13]


On the other
hand, the LRA, represented by the solicitor general, contends that the decision
of the trial court is not valid, considering that â[the] Court of First
Instance has no jurisdiction to decree again the registration of land already
decreed in an earlier land registration case and [so] a second decree for the
same land is null and void.â
[14]
 On the question of whether the LRA
can be compelled to issue a decree of registration, the solicitor general cites

Ramos vs. Rodriguez
[15]
 
which held:
[16]


âNevertheless, even granting that
procedural lapses have been committed in the proceedings below, these may be
ignored by the Court in the interest of substantive justice.  
This is especially true when, as in this
case, a strict adherence to the rules would result in a situation where the LRA
would be compelled to issue a decree of registration over land which has
already been decreed to and titled in the name of another.


It must be noted that petitioners
failed to rebut the LRA report and only alleged that the title of the Payatas
Estate was spurious, without offering any proof to substantiate this
claim.  TCT No. 8816, however, having
been issued under the Torrens system, enjoys the conclusive presumption of
validity.  As we declared in an early
case, 
â(t)he very purpose of the Torrens system would be destroyed if the
same land may be subsequently brought under a second action for
registration.â  The application for
registration of the petitioners in this case would, under the circumstances,
appear to be a collateral attack of TCT No. 8816 which is not allowed under
Section 48 of P.D. 1529.â
  (Underscoring supplied.)


We agree with
the solicitor general.  We hold that
mandamus is not the proper remedy for three reasons.


First:  
Judgment Is Not Yet Executory


Contrary to the
petitionersâ allegations, the judgment they seek to enforce in this petition is
not yet executory and incontrovertible under the Land Registration Law.  That is, they do not have any clear legal
right to implement it.  We have
unambiguously ruled that a judgment of registration does not become executory until
after the expiration of one year after the entry of the final decree of registration.  We explained this in 
Gomez vs. Court of
Appeals
:
[17]


âIt is not disputed that the
decision dated 5 August 1981 had become final and executory.  Petitioners vigorously maintain that said
decision having become final, it may no longer be reopened, reviewed, much
less, set aside.  They anchor this claim
on section 30 of P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree)  which provides that, after judgment has
become final and executory, the court shall forthwith issue an order to the
Commissioner of Land Registration for the issuance of the decree of
registration and certificate of title.  Petitioners contend that section 30 should be read in relation to
section 32 of P.D. 1529 in that, once the judgment becomes final and executory
under section 30, the decree of registration must issue as a matter of
course.  This being the law, petitioners
assert, when respondent Judge set aside in his decision, dated 25 March 1985,
the decision of 5 August 1981 and the order of 6 October 1981, he clearly acted
without jurisdiction.


Petitionersâ contention is not
correct.  Unlike ordinary civil actions,
the adjudication of land in a cadastral or land registration proceeding does
not become final, in the sense of incontrovertibility until after the
expiration of one (1) year after the entry of the final decree of
registration.  This Court, in several
decisions, has held that as long as a final decree has not been entered by the
Land Registration Commission (now NLTDRA) and the period of one (1) year has
not elapsed from date of entry of such decree, the title is not finally
adjudicated and the decision in the registration proceeding continues to be
under the control and sound discretion of the court rendering it.â


Second:  
A
 
Void Judgment Is Possible 


That the LRA hesitates
in issuing a decree of registration is understandable.  Rather than a sign of negligence or
nonfeasance in the performance of its duty, the LRAâs reaction is reasonable,
even imperative.  Considering the
probable duplication of titles over the same parcel of land, such issuance may
contravene the policy and the purpose, and thereby destroy the integrity, of
the Torrens system of registration.


In 
Ramos vs.
Rodriguez,
[18]
 this Court ruled that the LRA is
mandated to refer to the trial court any doubt it may have in regard to the
preparation and the issuance of a decree of registration.  In this respect, LRA officials act not as
administrative officials but as officers of said court, and their act is the
act of the court.  They are specifically
called upon to âextend assistance to courts in ordinary and cadastral land
registration proceedings.â


True, land
registration is an 
in rem
 proceeding and, therefore, the decree of
registration is binding upon and conclusive against all persons including the
government and its branches, irrespective of whether they were personally
notified of the application for registration, and whether they filed an answer
to said application.  This stance of
petitioners finds support in Sec. 38 of Act 496 which provides:


âSEC. 38.  If the court after hearing finds that the applicant or adverse
claimant has title as stated in his application or adverse claim and proper for
registration, a decree of confirmation and registration shall be entered.  Every decree of registration shall bind the
land, and quiet title thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated in the
following section.  It shall be
conclusive upon and against all persons, including the Insular Government and
all the branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application, notice,
or citation, or included in the general description âTo all whom it may
concern.â  Such decree shall not be
opened by reason of the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person
affected thereby, nor by any proceeding in any court for reversing judgments or
decrees; subject, however, to the right of any person deprived of land or of
any estate or interest therein by decree of registration obtained by fraud to
file in the competent Court of First Instance a petition for review within one
year after entry of the decree, provided no innocent purchaser for value has
acquired an interest.  Upon the
expiration of said term of one year, every decree or certificate of title
issued in accordance with this section shall be incontrovertible.  If there is any such purchaser, the decree
of registration shall not be opened, but shall remain in full force and effect
forever, subject only to the right of appeal herein before provided:  
Provided, however, 
That no decree or
certificate of title issued to persons not parties to the appeal shall be
cancelled or annulled.  But any person
aggrieved by such decree in any case may pursue his remedy by action for
damages against the applicant or any other person for fraud in procuring the
decree.  Whenever the phrase âinnocent
purchaser for valueâ or an equivalent phrase occurs in this Act, it shall be
deemed to include an innocent lessee, mortgagee, or other encumbrancer for
value.  (
As amended by Sec. 3, Act
No. 3621; and Sec. 1, Act No. 3630, and PD 1529, Sec. 39
).â


However, we must
point out that the letters of Silverio G. Perez and Felino M. Cortez, dated
April 29, 1992 and November 27, 1995, respectively, clearly stated that, after
verification from the records submitted by the Registry of Deeds of Rizal, the
property which petitioners are seeking to register -- Lot 3-A of Subdivision
Plan Psd-1372 -- is a portion of Lot No. 3, Block 159, Plan S.W.O.-7237, over
which TCT No. 6595 has already been issued.  Upon the other hand, in regard to Lot 3-B of said Lot 3, TCT No. 29337
was issued in lieu of TCT No. 6595.  Thus, the LRAâs refusal to issue a decree of registration is based on
documents which, if verified, may render the judgment of the trial court void.


It is settled
that a land registration court has no jurisdiction to order the registration of
land already decreed in the name of another in an earlier land registration
case.  A second decree for the same land
would be null and void,
[19]
 since the principle behind original
registration is to register a parcel of land only once.
[20]
 Thus, if it is proven that the land
which petitioners are seeking to register has already been registered in 1904
and 1905, the issuance of a decree of registration to petitioners will run
counter to said principle.  As ruled in 
Duran
vs. Olivia
:
[21]


âAs the title of the respondents,
who hold certificates of title under the Land Registration Act becomes
indefeasible, it follows that the Court of First Instance has no power or
jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for the registration of the same parcels
of land covered by the certificates of title of the respondents.  Such has been our express ruling in the case
of Rojas, et al. v. The City of Tagaytay, et al., G.R. No. L-13333, prom.
November 24, 1959, in which this Court, through Mr. Justice Barrera, said:


âAs thus viewed, the pivotal issue
is one of jurisdiction on the part of the lower court.  All the other contentions of respondent
regarding possession in good faith, laches or claims of better right, while
perhaps valid in an appropriate ordinary action, as to which we here express no
opinion, can not avail in the case at bar if the court 
a quo
, sitting as
land registration court, had no jurisdiction over the subject matter in
decreeing on June 30, 1957, the registration, in favor of respondent city, of a
lot already previously decreed and registered in favor of the petitioners.


âIn a quite impressive line of
decisions, it has been well-settled that a Court of First Instance has no
jurisdiction to decree again the registration of land already decreed in an
earlier land registration case and a second decree for the same land is null
and void.  This is so, because when once
decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the title to the land thus determined
is already a 
res judicata 
binding on the whole world, the proceedings
being 
in rem.  
The court has no
power in a subsequent proceeding (not based on fraud and within the statutory
period) to adjudicate the same title in favor of another person.  Furthermore, the registration of the
property in the name of first registered owner in the Registration Book is a
standing notice to the world that said property is already registered in his
name.  Hence, the latter applicant is
chargeable with notice that the land he applied for is already covered by a
title so that he has no right whatsoever to apply for it.  To declare the later title valid would
defeat the very purpose of the Torrens system which is to quiet title to the
property and guarantee its indefeasibility.  It would undermine the faith and confidence of the people in the
efficacy of the registration law.â


Third:  
Issuance of a Decree Is Not a Ministerial
Act


The issuance of
a decree of registration is part of the judicial function of courts and is not
a mere ministerial act which may be compelled through mandamus.  Thus, this Court held in 
Valmonte and
Jacinto vs. Nable
:
 
[22]


âMoreover, after the rendition of a
decision by a registration or cadastral court, there remain many things to be
done before the final decree can be issued, such as the preparation of amended
plans and amended descriptions, especially where the decision orders a
subdivision of a lot, the segregation therefrom of a portion being adjudicated
to another party, to fit the said decision.  As said by this Court in the case of De los Reyes 
vs. 
De Villa,
48 Phil., 227, 234:


âExamining section 40, we find that
the decrees of registration must be stated in convenient form for transcription
upon the certificate of title and must contain an accurate technical
description of the land.  This requires
trained technical men.  Moreover, it
frequently occurs that only portions of a parcel of land included in an
application are ordered registered and that the limits of such portions can
only be roughly  indicated in the
decision of the court.   In such cases
amendments of the plans and sometimes additional surveys become necessary
before the final decree can be entered.  That can hardly be done by the court itself; the law very wisely charges
the chief surveyor of the General Land Registration Office with such
duties  (Administrative Code, section
177).â


Furthermore, although the final
decree is actually prepared by the Chief of the General Land Registration
Office, the administrative officer, 
the issuance of the final decree can
hardly be considered a ministerial act for the reason that said Chief of the
General Land Registration Office acts not as an administrative officer but as
an officer of the court and so the issuance of a final decree is a judicial
function and not an administrative one
 (De los Reyes 
vs. 
De Villa, 
supra
).  x x xâ (Underscoring supplied.)


Indeed, it is
well-settled that the issuance of such decree is not compellable by mandamus
because it is a judicial act involving the exercise of discretion.
[23]
 Likewise, the writ of mandamus can
be awarded only when  the  petitionersâ  legal  right to the performance
of the particular act which is sought to be compelled is clear and complete.
[24]
 Under Rule 65 of the Rules of
Court, a clear legal right is a right which is indubitably granted by law or is
inferable as a matter of law.  If the
right is clear and the case is meritorious, objections raising merely technical
questions will be disregarded.
[25]
 But where the right sought to be
enforced is in substantial doubt or dispute, as in this case, mandamus cannot
issue.


A court may be
compelled by mandamus to pass and act upon a question submitted to it for
decision, but it cannot be enjoined to decide for or against one of the
parties.
[26]
 As stated earlier, a judicial act
is not compellable by mandamus.
[27]
 The court has to decide a question
according to its own judgment and understanding of the law.
[28]


In view of the
foregoing, it is not legally proper to require the LRA to issue a decree of
registration.  However, to avoid multiplicity
of suits and  needless  delay,  this  Court deems it more
appropriate to direct the LRA to expedite its study, to determine with finality
whether Lot 3-A is included in the property described in TCT No. 6595, and to
submit a report thereon to the court of origin within sixty (60) days from
receipt of this Decision, after which the said court shall act with deliberate
speed according to the facts and the law, as herein discussed.  


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is hereby DISMISSED
but the case is REMANDED to the court of origin in Pasig City.  The Land Registration Authority, on the
other hand, is ORDERED to submit to the court a quo a report determining with
finality whether Lot 3-A is included in the property described in TCT No. 6595,
within sixty (60) days from notice.  After receipt of such report, the land registration court, in turn, is
ordered to ACT, with deliberate and judicious speed, to settle the issue of
whether the LRA may issue the decree of registration, according to the facts
and the law as herein discussed.
