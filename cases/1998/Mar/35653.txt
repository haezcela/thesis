ROMERO, J.:


This petition
for review on 
certiorari
 assails the decision
[1]
J

J.J.

concurring.1 of the Court of Appeals denying the petition for 
certiorari

filed by the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. which sought the reversal of
the orders dated March 31 and October 15, 1992, of the Regional Trial Court of
Makati, Branch 62.
[2]
 The lower court had denied the
motion to dismiss the petition for cancellation of the restrictions annotated
in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 47348 of the Registry of Deeds of Makati,
Metro Manila. 


Petitioner San
Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. (SLVAI) and San Lorenzo Company, Inc. were
the respondents in the aforesaid petition filed on December 13, 1991 before the
lower court by private respondent Almeda Development and Equipment Corporation
(ADEC). For clarity, the pertinent portions of that petition in Civil Case No.
91-3450 are hereby quoted as follows:


â3. 
          
The petitioner is the owner of that parcel of land with
building and other improvements situated at Pasay Road, San Lorenzo Village,
Makati, Metro Manila, embraced in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 47348 of
the Registry of Deeds of Makati, Metro Manila, more particularly described as
follows:


    
x  x  x  x   x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x.


The petitionerâs ownership thereto
is evidenced by the Deed of Sale executed by Ponciano L. Almeda, married to
Eufemia Perez-Almeda, and the petitioner on September 15, 1991, entered as Doc.
No. 218; Page No. 45; Book No. VIII; Series of 1991, evidenced by its copy
hereto attached as Annex `Aâ.


4. 
           
As
the owner of the said parcel of land together with the building and other
improvements thereon, the petitioner has the right to enjoy and dispose of said
property without limitation except those established by law (Art. 428, Civil
Code).


    
x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x.


5. 
           
In
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 47448 (sic), there appears Entry No. 59599,
reading in part as follows:


`The owner of this lot or his
successor in interest is required to be and is automatically a member of the
San Lorenzo Village Association. The lot may not be subdivided.  The lot shall only be used for residential purposes.
Only one single storey or one (duplex) house may be constructed on a single
lot, although separate servantâs quarter or garage may be built.  The property is subject to an easement of
two meters within the lot and adjacent to the rear and sides thereof not
fronting a street for the purpose of drainage, sewage, water and other public
facilities as may be necessary and desirable.


All buildings on the lot must be of
strong materials.  Building shall not be
higher than 5 meters above the ground directly beneath the point in
question.  All building plans must be
approved by the Association before construction begins.  All buildings including garage, servantâs
quarter (
porte cocheres
) must be constructed x x x not less than 3
meters from boundary bordering a wall, not including pedestrian paths, and not
less than 2 meters from the other boundaries of this lot.  Sewage disposal must be by means of septic
tank or into a sewage system. 


Walls on the perimeter of this
property shall not exceed 2 meters in height, except that no restriction as to
height applies to walls made of live vegetation.â


Evidenced
by TCT No. 47348 and Entry NO. 59599 (Memorandum of Encumbrances) thereof
marked as Annexes `Bâ and `B-1â, respectively.


6. 
           
The
condition prevailing along Pasay Road (San Lorenzo Village) on July 10, 1958,
the date when the restrictions were imposed by the San Lorenzo Company, Inc. to
lot and house owners in San Lorenzo Village and on July 11, 1958, when the Deed
of Restrictions was annotated on TCT No. 60143/T-577 (the certificate of title
from where TCT No. 47448 originated), is no longer the same compared
today.  At that time, houses located
along Pasay Road (San Lorenzo Village) were used purely for residential
purposes.  Today, what are found along
Pasay Road (San Lorenzo Village) are commercial/industrial buildings such as
the matter of security and garage (sic) collections are taken care of by their
buyers. Accordingly, the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. is no longer
relevant in so far as the building and lot owners along Pasay Road (San Lorenzo
Village) are concerned.


7. 
           
The
aforementioned annotation in TCT No. 47348 in (sic) an unlawful limitation to
the rights of the petitioner protected by the Constitution and prescribed in
Art. 428 of the Civil Code.


7.1  The petitioner does not
intend to be a member of the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc.


7.2
    
The petitioner has its own
security guards and garbage trucks.


7.3
    
The petitioner can
effectively protect its ownership and possession without the assistance and
intervention of the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc.


7.4
    
The petitioner intends to
construct a taller building on the lot.


8.  While in Sec. 30, Presidential Decree No. 957, it is provided
that  - 


`SEC. 30. Organization of
Homeowners Association. - The owner or developer of a subdivision project or
condominium project shall initiate the organization of a homeowners association
among the buyers and residents of the projects for the purpose of promoting and
protecting their mutual interest and assist in their community development.â


there is no
law compelling lot and house buyers to be a member of the San Lorenzo Company,
Inc. and restricting the petitioner to construct a taller building on its lot.


9. 
           
As
stated above, there is compelling reason for the cancellation of the
restrictions imposed at the back of TCT No. 47348.


10. 
         
If there is no vested right in existing law which can be
repealed or judicial interpretation which can be changed, there is no reason why
a Deed of Restrictions annotated in a certificate of title cannot be cancelled.


11. 
        
To cancel the aforementioned annotation
in TCT No. 47348 and to enforce its right, the petitioner was compelled to
engage the services of a lawyer for a fee and to institute this action
incurring and will incur litigation expenses.â
[3]


ADEC prayed for
the issuance of a temporary restraining order directing the San Lorenzo
Company, Inc. and its agents âto cease and desist from making the petitioner a
member of the San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. and prohibiting the
petitioner from constructing a taller building on its lot and the San Lorenzo
Village Association, Inc. from collecting membership fee and monthly dues and
other assessments.â It likewise prayed that the Register of Deeds of Makati be
ordered to cancel Entry No. 59599 in TCT No. 47348 and that respondents pay
actual damages of 
P
30,000.00, attorneyâs fees of 
P
30,000.00 plus 
P
500
allowance per attendance in court hearings and the costs of suit.


Therein private
respondent SLVAI filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds of lack
of cause of action and lack of ADECâs personality to sue. It alleged that ADEC
was not a registered owner of the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 47348; that
the sale of the property by Ponciano L. Almeda to ADEC could not bind third
parties; that ADEC had no reason to pray for the cancellation of Entry No.
59599 not being the owner of the land nor a member of SLVAI but simply a
stranger that had no demandable right against the SLVAI.
[4]
 


ADEC opposed the
motion to dismiss contending that it had a cause of action against SLVAI
because as the (new) owner of the lot involved, it cannot be compelled to
become a member of the SLVAI for to do so would unduly limit its use of the
property. Citing Philippine Suburban Development Corporation v. Auditor
General,
[5]
 it asserted that it had the
capacity and personality to sue because actual notice of the sale was
equivalent to registration.
[6]


On March 31,
1992, the lower court issued an Order denying the motion to dismiss, holding as
follows:


âThis Court agrees with the
plaintiff that it has the capacity and legal personality to file this
case.  Plaintiff has shown its interest
in the subject property, basing its claims on a Deed of Sale dated September
11, 1990.  As successor in interest of
the original registered owner, plaintiff step (sic) into the shoes of the
latter, consequently it can sue and be sued.â


SLVAI filed a
motion for the reconsideration of that Order
[7]
 alleging that third persons were
not bound by the deed of sale of the property entered into between ADEC and
Ponciano Almeda, as said deed of sale was not registered. As such, ADEC had no
cause of action against it. Furthermore, Almeda, not having paid the
association dues and garbage fees, he was sued before the Regional Trial Court
of Pasig, Branch 151, where the same deed of sale was presented to prevent the
scheduled auction sale through a third-party claim.  In quashing the third-party claim, then Judge Eutropio MigriÃ±o
ruled that the title to the property being still in the name of defendant
Almeda, whatever transaction he had entered into would not be binding upon the
plaintiff.


In its
opposition to the motion for reconsideration, ADEC contended that said motion
was 
pro forma
 as it merely reiterated the arguments in the motion to
dismiss. Citing Article 709 of the Civil Code which states that â(t)he titles
of ownership, or other rights over immovable property, which are not duly
inscribed or annotated in the Registry of Property shall not prejudice third
persons,â ADEC averred that within the context of that law, the SLVAI was not a
âthird personâ because it âmerely caused the annotation on the title of a
property of certain restraints or impositions on the exercise of ownership by
the registered owner.â It added that SLVAI had no interest in the property in
question âexcept to compel the owner thereof to be automatically a member of
the San Lorenzo Village Association and to pay the consequential dues or fees
and other expenses therefor.â As such, SLVAI and San Lorenzo Village Company,
Inc., were included in the case âonly as parties who had caused the annotation
or inscription of the entry in question which limits or restricts the exercise
of ownership over the aforesaid land, and who may be affected thereby, directly
or indirectly, by its cancellation, in the same manner that the Register of
Deeds of Makati has also been impleaded as the public official who is charged
with the duty of registering or canceling the subject annotation or
inscription.â
[8]
 


In its reply to
the opposition, SLVAI countered that the motion for reconsideration was not 
pro
forma
 as the lower court failed to consider the provisions of Article 709
of the Civil Code and Section 50 of the Land Registration Act.  It alleged that the term âthird personsâ in
Article 709 was broad enough to cover âeverybodyâ who did not participate in
the disputed act, contract or deed. It asserted that, while it had a lien over
unpaid association dues and garbage fees, ADEC was not the real party in
interest in the suit for cancellation of restrictions on the title that was
still in the name of Almeda and therefore the case should have been dismissed
outright for lack of cause of action.  Moreover, while ADEC claimed to be the owner of the property, it had not
explained why it had not registered the deed of sale and secured a separate
title to the property.
[9]


On October 15,
1992, the lower court issued the Order denying the motion for reconsideration
as follows:


âArticle 709 of the New Civil Code
x x x as the basis of this Motion for Reconsideration finds no application in
this case.  As correctly pointed out by
petitioner the `third personsâ mentioned in Article 709, are those persons who
may have adverse interests in the property itself either in the concept of an
owner, or a vendee or a mortgagee, or otherwise, but definitely not that of one
who has merely caused the annotation on the title of the property of certain
restraints or impositions on the exercise of ownership by the registered
owner.  Moreover, when respondent San
Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. convey (sic) the property to Ponciano Almeda,
the original owner, the latter has all the rights as an owner, including the
right to sell, which he did in favor of the petitioner.


As successor in
interest, petitioner can validly exercise the right to sue which the original
owner could lawfully do for the protection of the right as an attribute of
ownership.â
[10]


SLVAI questioned
the lower courtâs Orders before the Court of Appeals through a petition for 
certiorari

with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order.  It presented before said appellate court the
issue of whether or not the petition filed below by ADEC stated a cause of
action or that ADEC was the real party in interest.
[11]


On June 22,
1994, the Court of Appeals promulgated a Decision denying the petition for 
certiorari
.  The Court of Appeals noted that the petition
sought to âdiscredit the material allegation of ADEC that it is the owner of
the property covered by the subject transfer certificate of title.  It asserts that such allegation is merely a
conclusion or inference of ADEC and does not grant to the latter the
personality to sue the petitioner nor does such become the source of the right
to institute proceedings in the court below.â It held that:


âWe resolve to deny the petition,
reiterating the ruling made by the Supreme Court in 
Galeon versus Galeon, 49
SCRA 516, 520:


`It is well settled that in a
motion to dismiss a complaint based on lack of cause of action, âthe question
submitted to the court for determination is the sufficiency of the allegations
of fact made in the complaint to constitute a cause of action, and not whether
these allegations of fact are true, for said motion must hypothetically admit the
truth of the facts alleged in the complaint; x x xâ The test of the sufficiency
of the facts is whether or not, accepting the veracity of the facts alleged,
the court could render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the
prayer of the complaint.â


As such, the allegation of ADEC
that it is the owner of the property on the strength of the deed of sale should
be deemed hypothetically admitted, giving it capacity to file the proceedings
below.  The trial court was correct in
saying that `[p]laintiff has shown its interest in the subject property, . . .
As successor in interest of the registered owner, plaintiff step (sic) into the
shoes of the latter, consequently, it can sue and be sued.â (Order, March 31,
1992; Rollo, page 36).


The arguments advanced by
petitioner as to whether or not ADEC validly acquired title to the property is
one which is a matter more by way of defense and which may be properly threshed
out during the trial.  What the Supreme
Court likewise espoused in the 
Galeon case, page 520
 is apropos on this
issue:


`The uniform
ruling of this Court is that the trial court âmay not inquire into the truth of
the allegations, and find them to be false before a hearing is had on the
merits of the causeâ. If the court finds the allegations to be sufficient but
doubts their veracity, it is incumbent upon said court to deny the motion to
dismiss and require the defendant to answer.  The veracity of the assertions could be asserted at the trial on the merits.ââ
[12]


SLVAI filed a
motion for the reconsideration of that Decision but it was denied on August 26,
1994.  Hence, it is now before this
Court on a petition for review on 
certiorari
 raising the following
issues:


â1. 
          
THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE ALLEGATION
IN THE COMPLAINT OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT THAT IT IS THE `OWNERâ OF THE SUBJECT
PROPERTY ON THE BASIS OF A DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE `IS DEEMED HYPOTHETICALLY
ADMITTED GIVING IT CAPACITY TO FILE THE PROCEEDINGS BELOWâ, CITING GALEON VS.
GALEON, 49 SCRA 516, BECAUSE HYPOTHETICAL ADMISSION OF FACT DOES NOT EXTEND TO
INFERENCES OR CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM SUCH FACT EVEN ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT AS
HELD IN DE DIOS V. BRISTOL, L-25530, JANUARY 12, 1974.


2. 
           
ASSUMING
ARGUENDO THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT IS THE `OWNERâ OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, THE
SAME IS STILL INSUFFICIENT TO MAKE OUT A CAUSE OF ACTION BECAUSE THE DEED OF
RESTRICTIONS SOUGHT TO BE CANCELLED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT REQUIRES THAT THE
CANCELLATION THEREOF BE INITIATED BY `MEMBERSâ WHO ARE THE REGISTERED OWNERS OF
THE LOTS IN THE VILLAGE AND BY THEIR TWO THIRDS VOTE.


3. 
           
THE
COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT IS NOT THE REAL
PARTY-IN-INTEREST.â


These
contentions boil down to the sole issue of whether or not the petition below
alleges a cause of action against petitioner that the lower court may be deemed
to have correctly denied the motion to dismiss the same petition.


The Rules of
Court requires that the complaint must make a concise statement of the ultimate
facts or the essential facts constituting the plaintiffâs cause of action.  A fact is essential if it cannot be stricken
out without leaving the statement of the cause of action insufficient.
[13]
 A complaint states a cause of
action where it contains the three (3) essential elements of a cause of action,
namely: (1) the legal right of the plaintiff, (2) the correlative obligation of
the defendant, and (3) the act or omission of the defendant in violation of
said legal right.  If these elements are
absent, the complaint becomes vulnerable to a motion to dismiss on the ground
of failure to state a cause of action.  If the allegations are vague, indefinite, or in the form of conclusions,
the defendantâs recourse is not a motion to dismiss but a bill of particulars.
[14]


A motion to
dismiss on the ground of failure to state a cause of action in the complaint
hypothetically admits the truth of the facts alleged therein. However, the
hypothetical admission is limited to the ârelevant and material facts well
pleaded in the complaint and inferences fairly deductible therefrom.  The admission does not extend to conclusions
or interpretations of law; nor does it cover allegations of fact the falsity of
which is subject to judicial notice.â
[15]
 As this Court held in De Dios v.
Bristol Laboratories (Phils.), Inc.:


âx x x.  For the purpose, the motion to dismiss must
hypothetically admit the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint.  The admission, however, is limited only to
all material and relevant facts which are well pleaded in the complaint.  Thus, it has been ruled that a demurrer
admits only such matters of fact as are sufficiently pleaded; that the demurrer
does not admit the truth of mere epithets charging fraud; nor allegations of
legal conclusions; nor an erroneous statement of law.  The admission of the truth of material and relevant facts well
pleaded does not extend to render a demurrer an admission of inferences or
conclusions drawn therefrom, even if alleged in the pleading; nor mere
inferences or conclusions from facts not stated; nor conclusions of law; nor
matters of evidence; nor surplusage and irrelevant matter. x x x.â
[16]


However, it
should be pointed out at the outset that it is not âlack or absence of cause of
actionâ that is a ground for dismissal of the complaint, but rather, that âthe
complaint states no cause of actionâ.
[17]


De Dios did
indeed hold that a movant to dismiss on the ground of failure of the complaint
to state a cause of action is burdened with the implied admission of the truth
of âall material and relevant facts which are well pleaded in the complaint,â
but not of âmere epithets charging fraud,â or legal conclusions, or mere
inferences, or matters of evidence.  Said case gave examples of allegations not within the
hypothetical-admission rule, to wit: âmalicious and unjustifiedâ institution of
an action; acting maliciously and for the purpose of political persecution and
vengeance, with intent of circumventing a constitutional provision; usurping
the office of Senator of the Philippines; that the master had breached the
contract, or discharged an employee in a wrongful, illegal, unlawful, unjust
manner, etc.  


The above
ruling, however, does not apply to the case at bar.  In the instant case, the complaint asserts that plaintiff
purchased the property in question from the person admittedly holding title
thereto.  It then infers that by this
mode, it became the successor-in-interest of the vendor, if not indeed the
owner of the property.  Hence, the
restrictions in the title should be nullified not only because it is contrary
to law but also because the conditions under which they were imposed had ceased
to exist.  


In fact, the
averments in the complaint like the title of ADECâs vendor, the execution of
the sale by said vendor to ADEC, the latterâs status as the vendorâs
successor-in-interest, and the altered physical environment along Pasay Road,
are allegations well within the hypothetical-admission principle.  These averments satisfy the three (3)
elements of a cause of action.  In other
words, the complaint did state a cause of action.


In view of such,
SLVAI cannot successfully invoke the ground that the complaint âfails to state
a cause of actionâ in its motion to dismiss.  


Putting it
differently, what SLVAI  essentially  puts at issue is
whether substantively, ADEC, as plaintiff in the case below, possesses a
tenable right of action.  As discussed,
said issue is not a ground for a motion to dismiss.  As a matter of law, neither are the efficacy of the sale to pass
title to the property, and consequently, ADECâs acquisition of the status of
successor-in-interest, specific mandatory modes to challenge the restrictions
in question, or the change in the physical environment along Pasay Road,
grounds for a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules of Court.  Instead, the aforementioned issues may be
properly raised in the Answer.


Regarding the
third issue of whether ADEC is a real party in interest, said issue is likewise
not a proper ground for a motion to dismiss.  Certainly, as successor-in-interest of the original vendor, who is the
unquestioned title holder, ADEC has the prerogative to assert all the latterâs
rights, including the impugnation of the restrictions on the title.  The tenability of the grounds for that
impugnation, while proper under the pleadings, should be threshed out at the trial
on the merits.  


The only other
issue raised is that even assuming ADEC became owner of the property, it cannot
seek cancellation because, under SLVAIâs rules, the cancellation process can
only be initiated by âmembersâ of the SLVAI who are the registered owners of
the lots in the village and by their two-thirds vote.  However, those rules were not dealt with in the complaint at
all.  They may thus be raised only by
way of defense in the Answer, but not as ground for a motion to dismiss
available as cause for dismissal of the action at this early stage.


Finally, even
assuming that the allegation of the facts constituting ADECâs cause of action
is not as clear and categorical as would otherwise be desired, any uncertainty
thereby arising should be so resolved as to enable a full inquiry into the
merits of the action.  Such a course
would preclude that multiplicity of suits which the law abhors, and conduce to
the definitive determination and termination of the dispute.  On the other hand, the abortion of the
action on account of the alleged fatal flaws of the complaint would obviously
be indecisive; it would not end the controversy, since the institution of
another action upon a revised complaint would not be foreclosed.


WHEREFORE
, the petition should be DISMISSED
and the challenged decision of the Court of Appeals should be AFFIRMED.
