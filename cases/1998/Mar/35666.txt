SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 119571, March 11, 1998 ]


MITSUI O.S.K. LINES LTD.,
REPRESENTED BY MAGSAYSAY AGENCIES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF
APPEALS AND LAVINE LOUNGEWEAR MFG. CORP., RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O NÂ 




MENDOZA,Â  J.:


This is a petition for review on 
certiorari
 of the
January 25, 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals
[1]
 
and its resolution of March 22,
1995 denying petitionerâs motion for reconsideration.  The appellate court upheld orders of Branch 68 (Pasig) of the
Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, denying petitionerâs
motion to dismiss in the original action filed against petitioner by private
respondent.


The facts are not in dispute.
[2]
 


Petitioner Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. is a foreign corporation
represented in the Philippines by its agent, Magsaysay Agencies. It entered
into a contract of carriage through Meister Transport, Inc., an international
freight forwarder, with private respondent Lavine Loungewear Manufacturing
Corporation to transport goods of the latter from Manila to Le Havre,
France.  Petitioner undertook to deliver
the goods to France 28 days from initial loading.  On July 24, 1991, petitionerâs vessel loaded private respondentâs
container van for carriage at the said port of origin.


However, in Kaoshiung, Taiwan the goods were not
transshipped immediately, with the result that the shipment arrived in Le Havre
only on November 14, 1991.  The
consignee allegedly paid only half the value of the said goods on the ground
that they did not arrive in France until the âoff seasonâ in that country.  The remaining half was allegedly charged to
the account of private respondent which in turn demanded payment from
petitioner through its agent.


As petitioner denied private respondentâs claim, the latter
filed a case in the Regional Trial Court on April 14, 1992.  In the original complaint, private
respondent impleaded as defendants Meister Transport, Inc. and Magsaysay
Agencies, Inc., the latter as agent of petitioner Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.  On May 20, 1993, it amended its complaint by
impleading petitioner as defendant in lieu of its agent.  The parties to the case thus became private
respondent as plaintiff, on one side, and Meister Transport Inc. and petitioner
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. as represented by Magsaysay Agencies, Inc., as
defendants on the other.  


Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the claim
against it had prescribed under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.


The Regional Trial Court, as aforesaid, denied petitionerâs
motion as well as its subsequent motion for reconsideration.  On petition for 
certiorari
, the Court
of Appeals sustained the trial courtâs orders.  Hence this petition containing one assignment of error:


THE
RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF LAW IN RULING THAT
PRIVATE RESPONDENTâS AMENDED COMPLAINT IS (
sic
) NOT PRESCRIBED PURSUANT
TO SECTION 3(6) OF THE CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT.


The issue raised by the instant petition is whether private
respondentâs action is for âloss or damageâ to goods shipped, within the
meaning of Â§3(6) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).  


Section 3 provides:


(6)  Unless notice of loss or damage and the
general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his
agent at the port of discharge or at the time of the removal of the goods into
the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of
carriage, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the
carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading.  If the loss or damage is not apparent, the
notice must be given within three days of the delivery.


Said
notice of loss or damage may be endorsed upon the receipt for the goods given
by the person taking delivery thereof.


The
notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has at the time
of their receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection.


In
any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in
respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery
of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered:  Provided, that, if a notice of loss or
damage, either apparent or concealed, is not given as provided for in this
section, that fact shall not affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to
bring suit within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the
goods should have been delivered.


In
the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage, the carrier and the
receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and
tallying the goods. 


In 
Ang v. American Steamship Agencies, Inc.
, the
question was whether an action for the value of goods which had been delivered
to a party other than the consignee is for âloss or damageâ within the meaning
of Â§3(6) of the COGSA.  It was held that
there was no loss because the goods had simply been misdelivered.  âLossâ refers to the deterioration or
disappearance of goods.
[3]


As
defined in the Civil Code and as applied to Section 3(6), paragraph 4 of the
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, âlossâ contemplates merely a situation where no
delivery at all was made by the shipper of the goods because the same had
perished, gone out of commerce, or disappeared in such a way that their
existence is unknown or they cannot be recovered.
[4]


Conformably with this concept of what constitutes âlossâ or
âdamage,â this Court held in another case
[5]
 
that the deterioration of goods
due to delay in their transportation constitutes âlossâ or âdamageâ within the
meaning of Â§3(6), so that as suit was not brought within one year the action
was barred: 


Whatever
damage or injury is suffered by the goods while in transit would result in loss
or damage to either the shipper or the consignee.  As long as it is claimed, therefore, as it is done here, that the
losses or damages suffered by the shipper or consignee were due to the arrival
of the goods in damaged or deteriorated condition, the action is still
basically one for damage to the goods, and must be filed within the period of
one year from delivery or receipt, under the above-quoted provision of the
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.
[6]


But the Court allowed that â 


There
would be some merit in appellantâs insistence that the damages suffered by him
as a result of the delay in the shipment of his cargo are not covered by the
prescriptive provision of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act above referred to,
if such damages were due, not to the deterioration and decay of the goods while
in transit, but to other causes independent of the condition of the cargo upon
arrival, like a drop in their market value. . . .
[7]


The rationale behind limiting the said definitions to such
parameters is not hard to find or fathom.  As this Court held in 
Ang
:


Said
one-year period of limitation is designed to meet the exigencies of maritime
hazards.  In a case where the goods
shipped were neither lost nor damaged in transit but were, on the contrary,
delivered in port to someone who claimed to be entitled thereto, the situation
is different, and the special need for the short period of limitation in cases
of loss or damage caused by maritime perils does not obtain.
[8]
 


In the case at bar, there is neither deterioration nor disappearance
nor destruction of goods caused by the carrierâs breach of contract. Whatever
reduction there may have been in the value of the goods is not due to their
deterioration or disappearance because they had been damaged in transit. 


Petitioner contends:


Although
we agree that 
there are places in the section (Article III) in which the
phrase need have no broader meaning than loss or physical damage to the goods
,
we disagree with the conclusion that it must so be limited wherever it is
used.  We take it that the phrase has a
uniform meaning, not merely in Section 3, but throughout the Act; and there are
a number of places in which the restricted interpretation suggested would be
inappropriate.  For example Section 4(2)
[Article IV(2) (
sic)
 exempts exempts 
(sic) 
the carrier, the ship 
(sic),

from liability 
 
âloss or damageâ 
(sic)

resulting from certain courses beyond their control.
[9]


Indeed, what is in issue in this
petition is not the liability of petitioner for its handling of goods as
provided by Â§3(6) of the COGSA, but its liability under its contract of
carriage with private respondent as covered by laws of more general
application.


Precisely, the question before the trial court is not the
particular sense of âdamagesâ as it refers to the physical loss or damage of a
shipperâs goods as specifically covered by Â§3(6) of COGSA but petitionerâs
potential liability for the damages it has caused in the general sense and, as
such, the matter is governed by the Civil Code, the Code of Commerce and COGSA,
for the breach of its contract of carriage with private respondent.


We conclude by holding that as the suit below is not for
âloss or damageâ to goods contemplated in Â§3(6), the question of prescription
of action is governed not by the COGSA but by Art. 1144 of the Civil Code which
provides for a prescriptive period of ten years.  


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.  


SO ORDERED.
