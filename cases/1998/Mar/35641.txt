PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. GERARDO MOLAS Y CERDENA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

ROMERO, J.:


The pervasiveness
and escalating incidence of sexual crime in our society nowadays is a
phenomenon that arouses the highest degree of revulsion in all but the most
insensitive.  What is even more
disgusting is when the victim is a minor barely out of childhood and the
offender is a virtual member of the family living under the same roof.  For here there is rank betrayal of trust and
confidence.  Our numerous pronouncements
denouncing what is now categorized as a âheinous crimeâ do not seem to have
made an impact on those who give unfettered rein to their bestial
instincts.  The instant case eloquently
shows that the possible dire consequences on their dastardly acts never cross
the minds of those who are bent on violating the virginity and purity of young
girls such as the accused-appellant.


Appellant
Gerardo Molas y CerdeÃ±a was charged with three (3) counts of rape before the
Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 93
[1]
 in a complaint dated December 3,
1985 which reads as follows:


âI.  Criminal Case No. Q-43220


The undersigned accuses GERARDO MOLAS Y CERDEÃA of the crime of RAPE,
committed as follows:


That on or about the 12th day of
July, 1985, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of
force and intimidation, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, succeed in having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, below 12
years old, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and
prejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the
provisions of the Civil Code.


CONTRARY TO LAW.


Quezon City, Philippines, November
27, 1985.


II.  Criminal Case No. Q-43221


The undersigned accuses GERARDO
MOLAS Y CERDEÃA of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:


That on or about the 19th day of
July, 1985, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of
force and intimidation, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, succeed in having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, below 12
years old, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and
prejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the
provisions of the Civil Code.


CONTRARY TO LAW.


Quezon City, Philippines, November
27, 1985.


III.  Criminal Case No. Q-43222


The undersigned accuses GERARDO
MOLAS Y CERDEÃA of the crime of RAPE, committed as follows:


That on or about the 22nd day of
November, 1985, in Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of
force and intimidation, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, succeed in having carnal knowledge of the undersigned, a minor
below 12 years old, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and
prejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the
provisions of the Civil Code.


CONTRARY TO LAW.


Quezon City, Philippines, November
27, 1985.â


Upon
arraignment, appellant entered a plea of not guilty, after which trial on the
merits ensued.


The
prosecutionâs version of the commission of the crime, narrated through its
witness, complainant Lealyne Simangan, reveals the following facts:


Complainant,
born on July 5, 1978, was the daughter of the spouses Alejandro G. Simangan and
Erlinda M. Simangan.  The Simangans and
the appellant, who is the half-brother of complainantâs mother, all resided
under the same roof.


Upon attaining
the age of seven (7) years, complainant was subjected to sexual abuse by the
appellant who was her step uncle.  The
attack on her virtue started on July 12, 1985.  On that day, while the complainant was alone watching television, the
appellant suddenly emerged and started to make sexual advances on her.  To consummate his bestial desire, the
appellant undressed the complainant and succeeded in having his carnal desire
sated.


Barely a week
after the first incident or on July 19, 1985, appellant again molested the
complainant.  Under the same
circumstances, he undressed the complainant and made her lie down on the floor
and thereafter forcibly mounted her to satisfy his lust.  As in the first incident, complainant did
not reveal her traumatic ordeal to her parents for fear of being scolded.


Four months
later or on November 22, 1985, appellant saw the complainant playing with her
younger sister inside their house.  Ostensibly, and as a means to fulfill his seemingly insatiable desire, he
asked the complainantâs younger sister to run some errands.  Convinced that the sister had left,
appellant undressed the complainant and made her lie down.  Thereafter, as in the first two instances,
he mounted the complainant and was able to have coitus with her.  Appellant, however, did not realize that the
complainantâs sister witnessed the sexual congress and immediately narrated the
incident to their mother.


In his defense,
the appellant merely denied the accusations against him  claiming that it was not possible for him to
commit the crime, since his house was far from the complainantâs
residence.  Moreover, he insinuates that
the injuries on the private parts of the complainant must have come about as a
result of her falling from a stairway and hitting a hard object.  Likewise, the appellant asserts that the
filing of the complaints was due to ill-will by the complainantâs family
against him.


After trial, the
lower court rendered judgment
[2]
 acquitting the appellant in
Criminal Case No. Q-43220 and Q-43221 for insufficiency of evidence.  However, it convicted the appellant in
Criminal Case No. Q-43222, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:


âWHEREFORE, the Court holds, that
the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable
doubt in Criminal Case No. Q-43222 for RAPE, and therefore, sentences Gerardo
Molas y CerdeÃ±a, to Reclusion Perpetua, and to pay the costs.


He is likewise ordered to indemnify
the offended girl in the sum of 
P
30,000.00 without subsidiary
imprisonment, in case of insolvency.


SO ORDERED.â


From the
foregoing conviction, appellant is now before us insisting on his
innocence.  
First
, he harps on
the failure of the trial court to consider Exhibit 1 and 1-A, a certification
dated November 4, 1986 issued by one Dr. Romeo E. Ariola, attesting that the
complainant was taken to V. Luna General Hospital on March 22, 1985 for
treatment of her private parts resulting from her accidental fall from the
stairs.  
Second
, the rape charges
against him were merely fabricated by the complainantâs family because of a
previous misunderstanding.


The defense must
fail as we are not impressed with appellantâs protestations.


It has always
been our consistent ruling that when there are conflicting versions of the
prosecution and the defense, the averments of the trial court are generally
viewed as correct and entitled to great weight
[3]
 except when the trial court has
overlooked certain facts which, if considered, could affect the result of the
case.
[4]
 Appellant, however, has not
presented any substantial argument, much less convincing material evidence, to
buttress his defense which could have been overlooked by the trial court to
justify a reversal of its conclusion.


Viewed in this
light, the contention that the trial court did not consider Exhibits 1 and 1-A
offered by the appellant is a misleading argument.  A review of the record would reveal that the trial court did
admit the said Exhibits in a ruling dated February 8, 1989.
[5]


Granting that
Exhibits 1 and 1-A were indeed erroneously excluded by the trial court, the
same were of little consequence for it is immaterial to the instant case.  We note that the said Exhibits were
certifications to the effect that the complainant was treated for injuries on
her private parts resulting from an accident sometime in March 1985.  However, the rape took place on November 22,
1985 or eight (8) months after the accident; therefore, the vaginal bleeding
discovered when the medical examination was conducted on the complainant on November
23, 1985 could not have been the result of the supposed accident.


In fact, the
medical report
[6]
 dated November 23, 1985, stated
that the bleeding could have occurred only within the past  24 or 48 hours.  This finding was supported by the testimony of the examining
physician, Dr. Desiderio A. Moraleda.
[7]
 Evidently, appellantâs assertion
that the vaginal bleeding was due to the complainantâs fall from the stairs,
which happened eight (8) months prior to the commission of the crime, is
utterly false.


In a desperate
and futile attempt to escape liability, appellant claims that the complainantâs
family merely concocted the rape charge against him.


The contention
is far from persuasive.  We have ruled
that a young girlâs revelation that she has been raped, coupled with her
voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public
trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her
dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.
[8]


Considering the
age of the complainant, who was seven years old when the crime was committed,
it would be improbable for a girl of her age to fabricate a charge so
humiliating to herself and her family had she not been truly subjected to the
painful experience of sexual abuse.
[9]


In the case at
bar, the complainant definitely does not have the gift of articulation and
inventiveness; hence, it is not possible for her to have fabricated the charges
against the appellant.  Assuming that
she was indeed tutored on what to say on the witness stand, it is worthy to
note that when she testified, she was alone; hence, any traces of inconsistency
would have easily been detected. More importantly, the complainant took the
witness stand six times to narrate her harrowing experience, and in all of
those instances, she underwent intensive cross-examination from the defense
[10]
but her testimony never wavered nor
faltered.


In other words,
it is most improbable that a girl of tender years, innocent and guileless,
would brazenly impute a crime so serious as rape to any man, if it were not
true.
[11]
 Certainly, complainantâs testimony
deserves utmost respect and credence.


In fine, there
is not an iota of doubt in our mind that appellant is guilty of the crime
charged, hence, we affirm his conviction.  Inasmuch as banishment to Hades is not one of the penalties sanctioned
by law, we shall just increase the indemnity from 
P
30,000.00 to 
P
50,000.00
consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.
[12]


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the
decision of the trial court dated February 20, 1989 in Criminal Case No.
Q-43222 is hereby AFFIRMED, subject to the MODIFICATION that appellant
indemnify the complainant in the amount of 
P
50,000.00.  Costs against appellant.


SO ORDERED.
