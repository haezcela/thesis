D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


As a rule,
factual findings of the NLRC are binding on his Court. However, when the
findings of the NLRC and the labor  arbiter are contradictory, this Court may review questions of facts.
Where the evidence clearly shows the absence of an employer-employee relationship,
a claim for unpaid wages, thirteenth month pay, holiday and rest pay and other
employment benefits must necessarily fail.


The Case


Before us is a
petition for 
certiorari
 assailing the April 29, 1994 Decision of the
National Labor Relations Commission,
[1]
 in Case No. 05-08-00348-92,
entitled âSimeon M. Mapa Jr., 
v
.
DZRC Radio Station.â The dispositive portion of the challenged Decision reads:


âWHEREFORE,
premises considered, the appealed decision is set aside, and a new judgment is
entered, declaring that complainant is an employee of the respondent and is
entitled to his claims for the payment of his services from March 11, 1990 to
January 16, 1992.â
[2]


Petitioner also
impugns the November 9, 1994 Resolution
[3]
 f the NLRC denying the motion for
reconsideration.


The October 13,
1993 decision of the labor arbiter,
[4]
 which the NLRC reversed and set
aside, disposed as follows:


âThis Arbitration
Branch, based on the facts and circumstances established by the parties in this
case is inclined to believe that complaint Simeon M. Mapa, Jr., had not been an
employee of the respondent DZRC Radio Station before February 16, 1992.
[5]
 He was but a volunteer reporter
when accommodated to air his report on the respondent radio station as his
application for employment with the respondent radio station as his application
for employment with the respondent as fieled reporter had not been accepted yet
or approved before February, 1992.  There was no employer-employee relations that existed  between the complainant and the respondent
since March 11, 1990 until February 16, 1992. The complainant is not entitled
to his claim for any salaries, premium pay for holiday and rest day, holiday
pay and the 13
th
 month pay against the respondent DZRC Radio
Station/Salvo Fortuno.


WHEREFORE, in the
light of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing  the complaint in his case for lack of
merit.â
[6]
 


The
Facts


Version of
Private Respondent


Petitioner and
private respondent submitted different versions of the facts. The facts as
viewed by private respondent are as follows:
[7]
 


âThe complainant (herein private
respondent) began to work for the respondent as a radio reporter starting March
11, 1990. On May 14, 1990, upon being informed by then respondentâs Station
Manager, Mr. Plaridel Brocales, that complainantâs employment with respondent
is being blocked by Ms. Brenda Bayona of DZGB, complainantâs previous employer,
the said complainant took a leave of absence. In the first week of June, 1990,
the respondent thru Mr. Antonio Llarena, then an employee of the respondent,
asked the complainant to return to work even as he was assured that his
salaries will be paid to him already. Thus, the complainant continued to work
for the respondent since then. On September 5, 1991, again the complainant took
a leave of absence because of his desperation over the failure of respondent to
make good its promise of payment of salaries. He was reinstated on January 16,
1992 and resigned on February 27, 1992 when he decided to run for an elective
office in the town of Daraga, albay. Unfortunately, the respondent paid salary
to the complainant only for the period from January 16, 1992 up to February 27,
1992. Respondent did not pay the complainant for all the services rendered by
the latter from March 11, 1990 up to January 16, 1992.â


As may be glened
from its memorandum,
[8]
 petitionerâs version of the facts
is as follows:


â1.  On or before April 1990, Mapa was dismissed from his employment
with PBN-DZGB Legaspi. At the time, Mapa filed a case for illegal dismissal
against PBN-DZGB Legaspi docketed as RAV V. Case No. 05-04-00120-90 entitled
âSimeon Mapa, Jr. 
v
. Peopleâs Broadcasting Network-DZGB Legaspi, Jorge
Bayona and Arturo Osiaâ.


2. On or about May 1990, Mapa
sought employment from DZRC as a radio reporter. However, DZRC required of
private respondent the submission of a clearance from his former employer.
Otherwise, his apllication would not be acted upon;


3.On May 14, 1990, Mapa was
informed by DZRC's  then station
manager, Mr. Plaridel âLarryâ Brocales, that his application for employment was
âbeing blocked by Ms. Brenda Bayona of DZGB, Mapaâs former employer.â This fact
is supported by Mapaâs position paper before the Honorable Labor Arbiter xxx;


4.
 
Taking
pity on Mapa and pending the issuance of the  clearance from PBN-DZGB Legaspi, Mr. Larry Brocales granted the request
of Mapa to be accomodated only as a volunteer reporter of DZRC on a part-time
basis. As a volunteer reporter, Mapa was not to be paid wages as an employee of
DZRC but he was permitted to find sponsors whose business establishments will
be advertised every time he goes on the air. Most importantly, Mapaâs only work
consisted of occasional newsbits or on-the spot reporting of consisted of
occasional newsbits or on-the spot reporting of incidents or newsworthy
occurances, which was very seldom.


5.
 
Mapaâs
friends who were also in the same situation as he was, declared in an affidavit
dated June 10, 1993 that:


âWE, ALLAN ALMARIO and ELMER
ANONUEVO, of legal age, single, with postal address at Washington Drive,
Legaspi City, under oath, depose and state:


1.
      
We personally know Simeon âJunâ Mapa, a
former volunteer reporter at DZRC just like us;


2.
      
As volunteer reporters we know that we
will not receive any salary or allowance from DZRC because our work was purely
voluntary;


3.
      
As incentive for us, the management of
DZRC allowed us to get our own sponsors whose business establishment we
mention[ed] every after field report was made by us;


4.
      
The management did not require or oblige
us to render a report. We were on our own. We ma[d]e or render[ed] a report as
we [saw]fit;


5.
      
During our stint as volunteer reporters we
had several sponsors each who paid us P300.00 per month (each).â

6.
 
Having no radio gadgets to begin with, DZRC
loaned Mapa the necessary equipment such as handheld radios and reporting
gadgets. Mapa was to do occasional reporting only, i.e., a few minutes each day
at an irregular time period at Mapaâs own convinience. Mapa advertised his
sponsors and pocketed the payment of these sponsors for his advertising
services. In addition, DZRC had no control over the manner by [sic] which he
was to make his reports. Nor were the said reports subject to editing by DZRC;


7.
 
In an Affidavit dated June 10, 1993 executed by
one of Mapaâs sponsors, the same reads as follows:


âI, CARLITO V. BAYLON, of legal
age, married, resident of Dona Maria Subdivision, Daraga, Albay, under oath,
despose and state:


1.  I am a lawyer by profession. At the same
time, I am owner of  âKusina ni Manoyâ a
restaurant situated in Daraga, Albay;


2.  I personally know Simeon âJunâ Mapa.
Sometime in May, 1990 he went to make and asked if I could be one of his
sponsors because he was accomodated by DZRC as volunteer reporter. He explained
to me that, he will not be receiving any salary from DZRC[;] hence, he was
soliciting any support;


3.  Taking pity on him, I agreed to be one of
his  sponsors. The condition was, I will
have to pay him P300.00/month. In exchange thereto, he will have to mention the
name of the name of my restaurant every time he renders a report on the air;


4.  My sponsorship lasted for about (5) months after which I discontinued it
when I rarely heard Jun Mapa in DZRC program.â

8.  On November 7, 1990, in his testimony
against his former employer, Mapa declared under oath. To wit:


âATTY. LOBRIGO:


âOn paragraph 14 of the same
affidavit it states and I quote:  13.  Having been left with an empty stomach, I
was compelled to apply for employment with another radio station.  On March 11, 1990, I applied for employment
with DZRC.  
Unfortunately, my
application would not yet be acted [upon] favorably 
because of the malicious
and oppressive imputations to me by my former employer.â


My question is what is now the
status of your employment with DZRC?


WITNESS:


I am at present on a 
volunteer
status
 because my former employer at DZGB did not give me clearance and I
am required to submit that clearance to DZRC.â  (Underlining supplied).â


See p. 2 of Position Paper of DZRC
before the Labor Arbiter and pp. 4-5 of the Transcript of Stenographer Notes
dated November 7, 1990, attached and marked as Annex âFâ and Annex âF-1â, Petition
for 
Certiorari
;


9.  It cannot be overstressed that Mapaâs
application for employment could not have been acted upon because of the lack
of the pre-requisite clearance.


10.  Lacking in sponsors, Mapa soon failed to
provide petitioner with newsbits, finding it unprofitable to continue since he
had no available sources of funding.  Sometime in September 1991, Mapa quit his part-time endeavor with DZRC,
as attested to by the Office of Supervisor/Traffic Manager Ignacio Casi in an
Affidavit dated June 10, 1992, to wit:


â1.
 
I am the Office Supervisor/Traffic Manager of DZRC-AM;


2.
 
Sometime in May, 1990 Simeon âJunâ Mapa went to
my office inside our radio station.  He
asked me if he could be accomodated as Radio Reporter of DZRC, as he was
dismissed from DZGB.   I referred him to
Larry Brocales, our Station Manager then;


3.
 
Larry Brocales told Jun Mapa that he cannot be
accomodated because he has no clearance from DZGB.  Jun Mapa, almost teary eyed, pleaded to Larry Brocales that he be
accomodated as volunteer reporter, that is, 
he will not receive any salary
but that he intimated that he be allowed to look for sponsors 
whose
business establishment, for a fee, will have to be mentioned after every report
is made.  Larry Brocales took pity on
Jun Mapa and accomodated him;


4.
 
Jun Mapa, just like the other volunteer
reporters, was not obliged to render field reports, at a particular time and in
a particular program.  They render
report as they wish or see fit;


5.
 
The
management (DZRC) does not collect anything from the sponsors of Jun Mapa.  They (sponsors) pay directly to him;


6.
 
Being the Office Supervisor, I know for a fact
that Jun Mapa seldom renders report on the air.  He has no assigned program either.  He was on and off the air, so to speak;


7.
 
Finally, some time in September, 1991, Jun Mapa
told me that he is quitting already because his sponsors were no longer paying
him of his monthly contract with them.â  (Underscoring supplied)(See Annex âGâ, Petition for 
Certiorari
);


11.
          
Subsequently, Mapa sent a letter dated
October 7, 1991 to Ms. Diana C. Gozum, General Manager of petitioner FBN.  In the said letter, Mapa wrote and admitted
that:


âI am [sic] Mr. Simeon Mapa, Jr.
respectfully request your good office to reconsider my previous application submitted
last March 1990 as a reporter of DZRC AM.


May I inform you that since the
submission of such application I worked until September 6, 1991 for free
services [sic].  Hoping that Iâll be
given the chance to be recognized as a regular reporter.


With this, I respectfully wish to
follow up my application for recognition.


May I also
inform you that the case I have with my previous job with the other company has
commenced.


Attached herewith is my resume.


I am once again submitting myself
for an interview with your office at a time convenient to you.


Thank you.â


(See Annex âHâ, Petition for 
Certiorari
);


12.
          
Reacting to the letter mentioned in
the immediately preceding paragraph, DZRC favorably acted upn the application
of Mapa and accepted him as a radio reporter on January 16, 1992;


13.
          
On February 27, 1992, Mapa resigned as
a radio reporter in order to run for an elective office in the May 1992
elections and was paid all his salaries and benefits for the period of his
employment commencing from January 16, 1992 until February 27, 1992;


14.
          
Having no work to do and no employment
in sight, Mapa filed a complaint against FBN-DZRC on August 1992, claiming the
payment of salaries, premium pay, holiday pay as well as 13
th
 month
pay for the period 28 February 1990 until January 16, 1992;â


On October 13,
1993, Labor Arbiter Emeterio Ranola dismissed the complaint for lack of merit,
finding that no employer-employee relationship existed between Mapa and DZRC
during the period March 11, 1990 to February 16, 1992.
[9]


Findings of the NLRC


In holding that
there was an employer-employee relationship, the NLRC set aside the labor
arbiterâs findings:


âIn his appeal, complainant insists
that there was an employer-employee relationship between him and the
respondent.  In support of his
contention, he cites the payroll for February 16 to 29, 1992, the ID card
issued to him as employee and regular reporter by the respondent:  [sic] the program schedules of DZRC showing
the regular program of the station indicating his name:  [sic] the affidavit of Antonio Llarena,
program supervisor of DZRCM, stating that he [was] a regular reporter underhis
supervision and the list of reporting gadgets issued to regular reporter.


The existence of employer employee
relationship is determined by the following elements, namely:  1) selection and engagement of the employee;
2) the payment of wages; 3) the power of dismissal; and 4) the power to control
employeeâs conduct although the latter is the most important element.  (Rosario Brothers, Inc. 
vs.
 Ople, 131
SCRA 72)


Considering the
totality of the evidence adduced by the parties, we are of the opinion that the
complainant is a regular reporter of the respondent.  Firstly, the work of the complainant is being supervised by the program
supervisor of the respondent; secondly, the complainant uses the reporting
gadgets of the respondent.  Thirdly, he
has no reporting gadgets of his own; Fourthly, the program schedule is prepared
by the respondent; and Lastly, he was paid salary for the period for the period
from February 16 to 29, 1992 and covered under the Social Security System.  There is no showing in the record that his
work from February 16, 1992 was different from his work before the said
period.â
[10]


The NLRC
subsequently denied petitionerâs motion for reconsideration
[11]
 on November 9, 1994.
[12]
 Hence this petition.
[13]


Issue


Petitioner
alleges that Public Respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion as
follows:
[14]


âI


xxx in declaring Mapa as an
employee of petitioner before January 16, 1992.  The test of an employer-employee relationship was erroneously
applied to the facts of this case.


II


xxx in disregarding significant
facts which clearly and convincingly show that the private respondent was not
an employee of the petitioner before 16 January 1992.â


In the main, the
issue in this case is whether private respondent was an employee of petitioner
for the period March 11, 1990 to January 15, 1992.


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
meritorious.


Main
Issue:


Private
Respondent Was Not an Employee During the Period in Controversy


As a rule, the
NLRCâs findings are accorded great respect, even finality, by this Court.  This rule, however, is not without
qualification.  This Court held in 
Jimenez
v. NLRC:
[15]
 


The review of
labor cases elevated to us on 
certiorari
 is confined to questions of
jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
[16]
 As a rule, this Court does not
review supposed errors in the decision of the NLRC which raise factual issues,
because factual finding of agencies exercising quasi-judicial functions are
accorded not only respect but even finality, aside from the consideration that
the Court is essentially not a trier of facts. However, in the case at bar, a
review of the records thereof with an assessment of the facts is necessary
since the factual findings of the NLRC and the labor arbiter are at odds with
each other.
[17]


In the present
case, a review of the factual findings of the public respondent is in order,
for said findings differ from those of the labor arbiter.
[18]
 Worse the facts alleged by the
private respondent and relied upon by the public respondent do not prove an
employer-employee relationship.
[19]
 In this light, we will review â and
overrule â the findings of the NLRC.


The following
are generally considered in the determination of the existence of an
employer-employee relationship: (1) the manner of selection and engagement, (2)
the payment of wages, (3) the presence or absence of the power of dismissal,
and (4) the presence or absence of the power of control; of these four, the
last one is the most important.
[20]


Engagement
and Payment of Wages


Let us consider
the circumstances of the private respondentâs engagement in DZRC before January
16, 1992. Petitioner did not act on his application for employment as a radio
reporter because private respondent admittedly failed to present a clearance
from his former employer. Nevertheless, private respondent âvolunteeredâ his
services, knowing that he would not be paid wages, and that he had to rely on
financial sponsorships of business establishments that would be advertised in
his reports. In other words, private respondent willingly acted as a volunteer
reporter, fully cognizant that he was not an employee and that he would not
receive any compensation directly from the petitioner, but only from his own
advertising sponsors.


The nature of
private respondentâs engagement is evident from the affidavit of Allan Almario
and Elmer Anonuevo who served under identical circumstances. The two affirmed
the following:


â1. We personally know Simeon âJunâ
Mapa, a volunteer reporter at DZRC just like us;


2. As a volunteer reporters we know
[sic] that we will not receive any salary or allowance from DZRC because our
work was purely voluntary;


3. As incentive for us, the management
of DZRC allowed us to get our own sponsors whose business establishments we
mention every after [sic] field report was made by us;


xxx
      
xxx
      
xxx


4. During our
stint as volunteer reporters we had several sponsors each who paid us 
P
300.00
per month.â
[21]


The above
statement is corroborated by Carlito Baylon, one of private respondentâs
advertising sponsors. In his affidavit dated June 10, 1993, he averred:


â2. I personally know Simeon âJunâ
Mapa.


Sometime in May, 1990, he went to
me and asked if I could be one of his sponsors because 
he was accomodated by
DZRC as volunteer reporter
. He explained to me that, he will not be
receiving any salary from DZRC[,] hence, he was soliciting my support;


3. Taking pity on him, I agreed to
be one of his sponsors. The condition was, I will have to pay him 
P
300.00/month.  In exchange thereto, he will have to mention
the name of my restaurant everytime he renders a report on the air;


4. My sponsorship
lasted for about five (5) months after which I discontinued it when I rarely
heard Jun Mapa in DZRC program.â
[22]


Indeed, private
respondent himself admitted tat he worked under the said circumstances. The
bio-data sheet signed by Mapa himself, in which he acknowledged that he was not
an employee, states in part:


âWork experiences:


DWGW
             
â¦.
      
Reporter/Newscaster
                     
1970-1980


DZGB
                
â¦.

1983-1990


DZRC
                
â¦.
      
Reporter
                                       
1990-1991


for free 
not recognized due to no
appointment
.
â
[23]


(Underscoring
supplied.)


In his letter
dated October 7, 1991, which he sent to the general manager of Filipinas
Broadcasting Network (owner of DZRC), Mapa again acknowledged in the following
words that he was not an employee:


âI am [sic] Mr. Simeon Mapa, Jr.
respectfully request your good office to reconsider my previous application
submitted last March 1990 as a reporter of DZRC AM.


May I inform you that since the
submission of such application 
I worked until September 6, 1991 for free of
services [sic]. Hoping that Iâll be given the chance to be recognized as a
regular reporter
.


With this, I respectfully wish to
follow up my application for recognition.â (Italics supplied.)


There is no
indication that these two circumstances were made under duress. Indeed, private
respondent himself did not dispute their voluntariness or veracity. It is clear
that he rendered services knowing that he was not an employee. Aware that he
would not be paid wages, he described himself as a âvolunteer reporterâ who
was, as evident from his letter, hoping for âthe chance to be recognized as a
regular reporter.â In fact, petitioner acted favorably on this letter and
accepted his application as an employee effective on January 16, 1992.


Power
of Dismissal


Likewise, the
evidence on record shows that petitioner did not exercise the power to dismiss
private respondent during the period in question. in September 1991, Private
Respondent Mapa ceased acting as a volunteer reporter, not because he was fired
, but because he stopped sending his reports. Ignacio Casi, Office Supervisor
of DZRC, declared in his affidavit that Mapa told him that âhe [was] quitting
already because his sponsors were no longer paying him of [sic] his monthly
contract with them.â Mapa did not controvert this statement. In fact, his
aforesaid letter of October 17, 1991 expressed his hope of being âgiven the
chance to be recognized as a regular reporter.â Private respondentâs attitude
in said letter is inconsistent with the notion that he had been dismissed.


Mapa
Was Not Subject to Control of Petitioner


The most crucial
test â the control test â demonstrates all too clearly the absence of an
employee-employee relationship. No one at the DZRC had the power to regulate or
control private respondentsâ activities or inputs. Unlike the regular
reporters, he was not subject to any supervision by petitioner or its
officials. Regular reporters âare required by the petitioner to adhere to a
program schedule which  delineates the
time when they are to render their reports, as well as the topic to be reported
upon. The substance of their reports are [sic] oftentimes screened by the
station prior to [their] actual airing. In contrast, volunteer reporters are
never given such a program schedule but are merely advised to inform the
station of the reports they would make from time to time.â
[24]


Indeed, DZRC,
the petitionerâs radio station , exercised no editorial rights over his
reports. He had no fixed day or time for making his reports; in fact, he was
not required to report anything at all. Whether he would air anything depended
entirely on him and his convenience.


The absence of
petitionerâs control over private respondent is manifest from the sworn
statement of the traffic manager of petitioner, Ignacio Casi, who deposed in
part:


âxxx
 
xxx
                              
xxx


4. 
Jun Mapa, just like the other
volunteer reporters, was not obliged to render field reports, at a particular
time and in a particular program. They render report as they wish or see fit;


5. The management (DZRC) does not
collect anything from the sponsors of Jun Mapa. They (sponsors) pay directly to
him;


6. 
Being the Office Supervisor,
I know for a fact that Jun Mapa seldom renders report on the air. He has no
assigned program either. He was on and off the air, so to speak;


7. Finally, some time in September,
1991, Jun Mapa told me that he is quitting already because his sponsors were no
longer paying him of his monthly contract with them.â


In 
Encyclopedia
Britannica (Philippines) Inc., v. NLRC,
[25]
 we reiterated that there could be
no employer-employee relationship where âthe element of control is absent;
where a person who works for another does so more or less at his own pleasure
and is not subject to definite hours or conditions of work[;] and in turn is
compensated according to the result of his efforts and not the amount thereof,
we should not find that the relationship of employer-employee exists.â In the
present case, private respondent worked at his âown pleasure and [was] not
subject to definite hours or conditions of work.â


â
Evidenceâ Found by NLRC Not Applicable


In its two-page
[26]
 holding that there was an
employer-employee relationship, the NLRC relied on the following:


(1)
   
the
payroll for February 16 to 29, 1992,


(2)
   
the ID
card issued to him as employee and regular reporter by the respondent,


(3)
   
the program
schedules of DZRC showing the regular program of the station indicating his
name:


(4)
   
the
affidavit of Antonio Llarena, program supervisor of DZRC, stating that he [was]
under his supervision, and 


(5)
   
the list of
reporting gadgets issued to a regular reporter.


Other than the
items enumerated above, no other document was considered by the NLRC. In other
words, its conclusion was based solely on these alleged pieces of evidence. It
clearly committed grave abuse of discretion in its factual findings, because
all the above documents relate to the period January 16, 1992 to February 28,
1992 and not to the period March 11, 1990 to January 15, 1992 which are
inclusive dates in controversy.


The payroll
[27]
 from February 16, 1992 to February
27, 1992 does not demonstrate that private respondent was an employee prior to
said period. Lest it be forgotten, the question in this case pertains to the
status of private respondent from March 11, 1990 to January 15, 1992. The said payroll
may prove that private respondent was an employee during said days in February
1992, but not for the period which is the subject of the present controversy.


Furthermore,
neither the identification cards nor the SSS number printed at the back thereof
indicate the date of issuance. Likewise, the SSS number does not show that he
was a member during the period in controversy; much less, that he became so by
reason of his employment with petitioner.


Similarly
inapplicable is the program schedule
[28]
 which allegedly showed the regular
program of the station and indicated the name of private respondent as an
employee. The document is a mere photocopy of a typewritten schedule. There is
absolutely no indicium of its authenticity. Moreover, it is undated; hence, it
does not indicate whether such schedule pertained to the period in disupte,
that is, March 11, 1990 to January 15, 1992. Worse, the heading thereof was
entitled âRadio DZRC Programming 
Proposal
. [italics supplied]â A
proposal is âput forth merely for consideration and acceptance.â
[29]
 It cannot, by itself, prove that
such program was implemented and that private respondent acted as an employee
of petitioner.


Neither does the
list of returned gadgets support the conclusion of the NLRC. It must be
stressed that such gadgets were essential to enable the private respondent to
access the specific radio frequency and fcailities of the radio station. Being
exclusive properties of the radio station, such gadgets could not have been
purchased, as they were not commercially available. In any event, the list of
returned gadgets was dated February 27, 1997 --  again, a date not in controversy. Such document, by itself, does
not prove that private respondent was an employee from March 20, 1990 to
January 15, 1992.


The affidavit of
Antonio Llarena
[30]
, an employee of DZRC, stating that
the private respondent was under his supervision, is vague, even misleading; it
declaring merely that Llarena was âin chargeâ of said respondent. Such language
could not be construed to mean that he exercised supervision and control over
private respondent.


Indubitably, the
NLRC based its findings of employer-employee relationship from the
circumstances attendant when private respondent was already a regular employee.
Uncontroverted is the statement that the private respondent was a regular
employee from January 16, 1992 to February 28, 1992, for which period he
received all employee benefits. But such period, it must be stressed again, is
not covered by private respondentâs complaint.


In sum, the evidence,
which Public Respondent NLRC relies upon, does not justify the reversal of the
labor arbiterâs ruling which, in turn, we find amply supported by the records.
Clearly, private respondent was not an employee during the period in question.
