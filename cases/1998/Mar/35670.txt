[ G.R. No. 120567, March 20, 1998 ]


PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., PETITIONER,
VS., NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, FERDINAND PINEDA AND GODOFREDO
CABLING, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


Can the National
Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), even without a complaint for illegal
dismissal filed before the labor arbiter, entertain an action for injunction
and issue such writ enjoining petitioner Philippine Airlines, Inc. from
enforcing its Orders of dismissal against private respondents,  and ordering petitioner to reinstate the
private respondents to their previous positions? 


This is the
pivotal issue presented before us in this petition for certiorari under Rule 65
of the Revised Rules of Court which seeks the nullification of the injunctive
writ dated April 3,1995 issued by the NLRC and the Order denying petitioner's
motion for reconsideration on the ground that the said Orders were issued in
excess of jurisdiction.


Private
respondents are flight stewards of the petitioner. Both were dismissed from the
service for their alleged involvement in the April 3, 1993 currency smuggling
in Hong Kong.


Aggrieved by
said dismissal, private respondents filed with the NLRC a petition
[1]
 for injunction praying that:


"I.  Upon filing of this Petition, a temporary restraining order be
issued, prohibiting respondents (petitioner herein) from effecting or enforcing
the Decision  dated  Feb. 22, 1995, or to reinstate petitioners
temporarily  while a hearing on the
propriety of the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is being
undertaken;


"II. After hearing, a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction be issued ordering respondent to reinstate
petitioners to their former positions pending the hearing of this case, or,
prohibiting respondent from enforcing its Decision dated February 22,1995 while
this case is pending adjudication;


"III.  After hearing, that the writ of preliminary
injunction as to the reliefs sought for be made permanent, that petitioners be
awarded full backwages,  moral damages
of PHP 500,000.00 each and exemplary damages of PHP 500,000.00 each, attorneyâs
fees equivalent to ten percent of whatever amount is awarded, and the costs of
suit."


On April 3,
1995,  the NLRC issued a temporary
mandatory injunction
[2]
 enjoining petitioner to cease and
desist from enforcing its February 22, 1995 Memorandum of dismissal. In
granting the writ, the NLRC considered the following facts, to wit:


âx x x  that almost two (2) years ago, i.e. on April 15, 1993, the
petitioners were instructed to attend an investigation by respondentâs
âSecurity and Fraud Prevention Sub-Departmentâ regarding an April 3, 1993
incident in Hongkong at which Joseph Abaca, respondentâs Avionics Mechanic in
Hongkong âwas intercepted by the Hongkong Airport Police at Gate 05 xxx the
ramp area of the Kai Tak International Airport while xxx about to exit said
gate carrying a xxx bag said to contain some 2.5 million pesos in Philippine
Currencies.  That at the Police Station,
Mr. Abaca claimed that he just found said plastic bag at the Skybed Section of
the arrival flight PR300/03 April 93,â where petitioners served as flight
stewards of said flight PR300; x x the petitioners sought âa more detailed
account of what this HKG incident is all aboutâ; but instead, the petitioners
were administratively charged, âa hearingâ on which âdid not push throughâ
until almost two (2) years after, i.e. âon January 20, 1995 xxx where a
confrontation between Mr. Abaca and petitioners herein was compulsorily
arranged by the respondentâs disciplinary boardâ at which hearing, Abaca was
made to identify petitioners as co-conspirators; that despite the fact that the
procedure of identification adopted by respondentâs Disciplinary Board was
anomalous âas there was no one else in the line-up (which could not be called
one) but petitioners xxx Joseph Abaca still had difficulty in identifying
petitioner Pineda as his co-conspirator,  and  as to petitioner Cabling, he
was implicated and pointed by Abaca only after respondentâs Atty. Cabatuando
pressed the former to identify petitioner Cabling as co-conspiratorâ; that with
the hearing reset to January 25, 1995, âMr. Joseph Abaca finally gave
exculpating statements to the board in that he cleared petitioners from any
participation or from being the owners of the currencies, and at which hearing
Mr. Joseph Abaca volunteered the information that the real owner of said money
was
 
one who frequented his headquarters in Hongkong to which
information, the Disciplinary Board Chairman, Mr. Ismael Khan,â opined âfor
 
the
need for
 
another hearing to go to the bottom of the incidentâ; that from
said statement, it appeared âthat Mr. Joseph Abaca was the courier, and had
another mechanic in Manila who hid the currency at the planeâs skybed for Abaca
to retrieve in Hongkong, which findings of how the money was found was
previously confirmed by Mr. Joseph Abaca himself when he was first investigated
by the Hongkong authoritiesâ; that just as petitioners âthought that they were
already fully cleared of the charges, as they no longer received any
summons/notices on the intended âadditional hearingsâ mandated by the
Disciplinary Board,â they were surprised to receive âon February 23, 1995 xxx a
Memorandum dated February 22, 1995â terminating their services for alleged
violation of respondentâs Code of Discipline âeffective immediatelyâ; that
sometime xxx first week of March, 1995, petitioner Pineda received another
Memorandum from respondent Mr. Juan Paraiso, advising him of his termination
effective February 3, 1995, likewise for violation of respondentâs Code of
Discipline; x x x"


In support of
the issuance of the writ of temporary injunction, the NLRC adopted the view
that: (1) private respondents cannot be validly dismissed on the strength of
petitioner's Code of Discipline which was declared illegal by this Court in the
case of PAL, Inc. vs. NLRC, (G.R. No. 85985), promulgated August 13, 1993, for
the reason that it was formulated by the petitioner without the participation
of its employees as required in R.A. 6715, amending Article 211 of the Labor
Code; (2) the whimsical, baseless and premature dismissals of private
respondents which "caused them grave and irreparable injury" is
enjoinable as private respondents are left "with no speedy and adequate
remedy at law'"except the issuance of a temporary mandatory injunction;
(3) the NLRC is empowered under Article 218 (e) of the Labor Code not only to
restrain any actual or threatened commission of any or all prohibited or
unlawful acts but also to require the performance of a particular act in any
labor dispute, which, if not restrained or performed forthwith, may cause grave
or irreparable damage to any party; and (4) the temporary mandatory power of
the NLRC was recognized by this Court in the case of Chemo-Technicshe Mfg.,
Inc. Employees Union,DFA, et.al. vs. Chemo-Technische Mfg., Inc. [G.R. No.
107031, January 25,1993].


On May 4,1995,
petitioner moved for reconsideration
[3]
 arguing that the NLRC erred:


1. â¦in granting a temporary
injunction order when 
it has no jurisdiction to issue an injunction or
restraining order since this may be issued only under Article 218 of the Labor
Code if the case involves or arises from labor disputes;


2. â¦in granting a temporary
injunction order when the termination of private respondents have long been
carried out;


3. ..in ordering the reinstatement
of private respondents on the basis of their mere allegations, in violation of
PAL's right to due process;


4. ..in arrogating unto itself
management prerogative to discipline its employees and 
divesting the labor
arbiter of its original and exclusive  jurisdiction over illegal dismissal cases;


5.  ..in suspending the effects of termination when such action is
exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Labor;


6. ..
in issuing the temporary
injunction in the absence of any irreparable or substantial injury to both
private respondents
.


On May 31,1995,
the NLRC denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration, ruling:


â
The respondent (now
petitioner), for one, cannot validly claim that we cannot exercise our
injunctive power under Article 218 (e) of the Labor Code on the pretext that
what we have here is not a labor dispute as long as it concedes that as defined
by law, aâ(l) âLabor Disputeâ includes any controversy or matter concerning 
terms
or conditions of employment.
â
 . If security of tenure, which has been
breached by respondent and which, precisely, is sought to be protected by our
temporary mandatory injunction (the core of controversy in this case) is not a
âterm or condition of employmentâ, what then is?


 
   
x x x

Anent respondentâs second
argument
 x x x, 
Article 218 (e)
of the Labor Code
 x x x 
empowered the Commission not only to issue a
prohibitory injunction, but a mandatory (âto require the performanceâ) one as
well. Besides, as earlier discussed, we already exercised (on August 23,1991)
this temporary mandatory injunctive power in the case of âChemo-Technische
Mfg., Inc. Employees Union-DFA  et.al.
vs. Chemo-Technishe Mfg., Inc., et. al.â (supra) and effectively enjoined one
(1) month old dismissals by Chemo-Technische and that our aforesaid mandatory
exercise of injunctive power, when questioned through a petition for
certiorari, was sustained by the Third Division of the Supreme court per its
Resolution dated January 25,1993
.

Respondentâs fourth argument
that petitioner's remedy for their dismissals is 'to file an illegal dismissal
case against PAL which cases are within the original and exclusive jurisdiction
of the Labor Arbiter'  is ignorant
. In requiring as a condition for the issuance of a
'temporary or permanent injunction'- '(4) That complainant has no adequate
remedy at law;
' Article 218 (e) of the Labor Code clearly envisioned 
adequacy

, and not plain 
availability
 of a remedy at law as an alternative bar to
the issuance of  an injunction. An
illegal dismissal suit (which takes, on its expeditious side, three (3) years
before it can be disposed of) while available as a remedy under Article 217 (a)
of the Labor Code, is certainly not an 'adequate; remedy at law. Ergo, it
cannot, as an alternative remedy, bar our exercise of that injunctive power
given us by Article 218 (e) of the Code.


xxx
     
xxx
     
xxx


Thus, Article 218 (e), as earlier discussed
[which empowers this Commission 'to require the performance of a particular
act' (such as our requiring respondent 'to cease and desist from enforcing' its
whimsical memoranda of dismissals and 'instead to reinstate petitioners to
their respective position held prior to their subject dismissals') in 'any
labor dispute which, if not xxx performed forthwith, may cause grave and
irreparable damage to any party'] stands as the sole 'adequate remedy at law'
for petitioners here.


Finally, the respondent, in its
sixth argument claims that even if its acts of dismissing  petitioners 'may be great, still the same is
capable of compensation', and that consequently, 'injunction need not be issued
where adequate compensation at law could be obtained'. Actually, what
respondent PAL argues here is that we need not interfere in its whimsical
dismissals of petitioners as, after all, it can pay the latter its backwages. x
x x


But just the same,
we have to stress that Article 279 does not speak alone of backwages as an
obtainable relief for illegal dismissal;  that reinstatement as well  is
the concern of said law, enforceable when necessary, through Article 218 (e) of
the Labor Code (without need of an illegal dismissal suit under Article 217 (a)
of the Code) if such whimsical and capricious act of illegal dismissal will
'cause grave or irreparable injury to a party'. x x x " 
[4]


Hence, the
present recourse.


Generally,
injunction is a preservative remedy for the protection of one's substantive
rights or interest. It is not a cause of action in itself but merely 
a
provisional remedy, an adjunct to a main suit
. It is resorted to  only  when there is a pressing necessity to avoid injurious consequences which
cannot be remedied under any standard of compensation. The application of the
injunctive writ rests upon  the
existence of an emergency or of a special reason before the main case be
regularly heard. The essential conditions for granting such temporary injunctive
relief are that the complaint alleges facts which appear to be sufficient to
constitute a proper basis for injunction and that on the entire showing from
the contending parties,  the injunction
is reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights of the plaintiff pending
the litigation.
[5]
 Injunction is also a special
equitable relief granted only in cases where there is no plain, adequate and
complete remedy at law.
[6]
 


In labor cases,
Article 218 of the Labor Code empowers the NLRC- 


"(e) To enjoin or restrain any
actual or threatened commission of any or all prohibited or unlawful acts or to
require the performance of a particular act 
in any labor dispute
 which,
if not restrained or performed forthwith,  may cause grave or irreparable damage 
to any party or render
ineffectual any decision in favor of such party
; x x x." (Emphasis
Ours)


Complementing
the above-quoted provision, Sec. 1, Rule XI of the New Rules of Procedure of
the NLRC, pertinently provides as follows:


"Section 1. 
Injunction in
Ordinary Labor Dispute
.-A preliminary injunction or a restraining order may
be granted by the Commission through its divisions pursuant to the provisions
of paragraph (e) of Article 218 of the Labor Code, as amended, when it 
is established on the bases of the
sworn allegations in the petition that the acts complained of, 
involving or
arising from any labor dispute before the Commission, 
  which, if not restrained or performed
forthwith, may cause grave or irreparable damage to any party or render
ineffectual any decision in favor of such party.


    
xxx
     
xxx
     
xxx


The 
foregoing
ancillary power
 may be exercised by the Labor Arbiters only as an incident
to the cases pending before them in order to preserve the rights of the parties
during the pendency of the case, but excluding labor disputes involving strikes
or lockout. 
[7]
 (Emphasis Ours)


From the
foregoing provisions of law, the power of the NLRC to issue an injunctive writ
originates from "
any labor dispute
" upon application by a
party thereof, which application if not granted "may cause grave or
irreparable damage to any party or render ineffectual
 
any decision in
favor of such party."


The term
"labor dispute" is defined as "any controversy  or matter concerning terms and conditions of
employment or  the association or representation
of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or arranging the
terms and conditions of employment regardless of whether  or not the disputants stand in the proximate
relation of employers and employees."
[8]


The term
"controversy" is likewise defined as "a 
litigated question
;

adversary proceeding in a court of law; a civil action or suit
, either at
law or in equity; 
a justiciable dispute.
"
[9]


A
"justiciable controversy" is "one involving an active
antagonistic assertion of a legal right on one side and a denial thereof on the
other concerning a real, and not a mere theoretical question or issue."
[10]


Taking into
account the foregoing definitions, it is an essential requirement that there
must first be a labor dispute between the contending parties before the labor
arbiter. In the present case, there is no labor  dispute  between  the petitioner and private respondents as
there has yet been no complaint for illegal dismissal filed with the labor
arbiter by the private respondents against the petitioner. 


The petition for
injunction directly  filed  before  the  NLRC is in reality an  action  for  illegal dismissal. This is
clear from the allegations in the petition which prays for: reinstatement of
private respondents; award of full backwages, moral and exemplary damages; and
attorney's fees. As such, the petition should have been filed with the labor
arbiter who has the original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide the
following cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:


(1) Unfair labor practice;


(2) 
Termination disputes;


(3)
 If accompanied with a claim
for reinstatement, those cases that workers may file involving wages, rates of
pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;


(4)
 Claims for actual, moral,
exemplary and other forms of damages arising from the employer-employee
relations;


(5) Cases arising from any
violation of Article 264 of this Code, including questions involving the
legality of strikes and lockouts; and 


(6) Except claims
for employees compensation, social security, medicare and maternity benefits,
all other claims arising from employer-employee relations, including those of
persons in domestic or household service, involving an amount exceeding five
thousand pesos (P 5,000.00), whether or not accompanied with a claim for
reinstatement.
[11]


The jurisdiction
conferred by the foregoing legal provision to the labor arbiter is both 
original

and 
exclusive
, meaning, no other officer or tribunal can take cognizance
of, hear and decide any of the cases therein enumerated. The only exceptions


  are  where the Secretary of Labor and Employment or the NLRC exercises
the power of compulsory arbitration, or the parties agree to submit the matter
to voluntary arbitration pursuant to Article 263 (g) of the Labor Code, the
pertinent portions of which reads:


"(g) When, in his opinion,
there exists a labor dispute causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout in
an industry indispensable to the national interest, the Secretary of Labor and
Employment may assume jurisdiction over the dispute and decide it or certify
the same to the Commission for compulsory arbitration. Such assumption or
certification shall have the effect of automatically enjoining the intended or
impending strike or lockout as specified in the assumption or certification
order. If one has already taken place at the time of assumption or
certification, all striking or locked out employees shall immediately resume
operations and readmit all workers under the same terms and conditions
prevailing before the strike or lockout. The Secretary of Labor and Employment
or the Commission may seek the assistance of law enforcement agencies to ensure
compliance with this provision as well as with such orders as he may issue to
enforce the same.


x x x  x x x  x x x "


On the other
hand, the NLRC shall have exclusive 
appellate 
jurisdiction over all
cases decided by labor arbiters as provided in Article  217(b) of the Labor Code.  In short, the jurisdiction of the NLRC in
illegal dismissal cases is appellate in nature and, therefore,  it cannot entertain the private respondents'
petition for injunction which challenges the dismissal orders of petitioner.
Article 218(e) of the Labor Code does not provide blanket authority to the NLRC
or any of its divisions to issue writs of injunction, considering that Section
1 of Rule XI of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC makes injunction only an
ancillary remedy in ordinary labor disputes"
[12]


Thus, the NLRC
exceeded its jurisdiction when it issued the assailed Order granting private
respondents' petition for injunction and ordering the petitioner to reinstate
private respondents.


The argument of
the NLRC in its assailed Order that to file an illegal dismissal suit with the
labor arbiter is not an "adequate" remedy since it takes three (3)
years before it can be disposed of, is patently erroneous. An
"adequate" remedy at law has been defined as one "that affords
relief with reference to the matter in controversy, and which is appropriate to
the particular circumstances of the case."
[13]
 It is a remedy which is equally
beneficial, speedy and sufficient which will promptly  relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the acts
complained of.
[14]


Under the Labor
Code, the ordinary and proper recourse of an illegally dismissed employee  is to file a complaint for illegal dismissal
with the labor arbiter.
[15]
 In the case at bar, private respondents  disregarded this rule and directly went to
the NLRC  through  a  petition  for  injunction  praying  that  petitioner be enjoined from enforcing its
dismissal orders. In 
Lamb vs. Phipps
,
[16]
 we ruled that if the remedy is
specifically provided by law, it is presumed to be adequate. Moreover, the
preliminary mandatory injunction prayed for by the private respondents in their
petition before the NLRC can also be entertained by the labor arbiter who, as
shown earlier, has the ancillary power to issue preliminary injunctions or
restraining orders as an incident in the cases pending before him in order to
preserve the rights of the parties during the pendency of the case.
[17]
 


Furthermore, an
examination of private respondents' petition for injunction reveals that it has
no basis since there is no showing of any urgency  or irreparable injury which  the private respondents might suffer. An injury is considered
irreparable if  it is of such constant
and frequent recurrence that no fair and reasonable redress can be had therefor
in a court of law,
[18]
 or where there is no standard by
which their amount can be measured with reasonable accuracy, that is, it is not
susceptible of mathematical computation. It is considered irreparable injury
when it cannot be adequately compensated in damages due to the nature of the
injury itself or the nature of the right or property injured or when there
exists no certain pecuniary standard for the measurement of damages.
[19]


In the case at
bar, the alleged injury which private respondents stand to suffer by reason of
their alleged illegal dismissal can be adequately compensated and therefore,
there exists no "irreparable injury," as defined above which would
necessitate the issuance of the injunction sought for. Article 279 of the Labor
Code provides that an employee who is unjustly dismissed from employment shall
be entitled to reinstatement, without loss of seniority rights and other
privileges, and to the payment of full backwages,  inclusive of  allowances,  and  to  other  benefits or their monetary
equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to
the time of his actual reinstatement. 


The ruling of
the NLRC that the Supreme Court upheld its power to issue temporary mandatory
injunction orders in the case of Chemo-Technische Mfg., Inc. Employees
Union-DFA, et.al. vs. Chemo-Technische Mfg., Inc. et.al., docketed as G.R. No.
107031, is misleading. As correctly argued by the petitioner, no such
pronouncement was made by this Court in said case. On January 25,1993, we
issued a Minute Resolution in the subject case stating as follows:


"Considering the allegations
contained, the issues raised and the arguments adduced in the petition for
certiorari , as well as the comments of both public and private respondents thereon,
and the reply of the petitioners to private respondent's motion to dismiss the
petition, the Court Resolved to DENY  the same for being premature."


It is clear from
the above resolution that we did not in anyway sustain the action of the NLRC
in issuing such temporary mandatory injunction but rather we dismissed the
petition as the NLRC had yet to rule upon the motion for reconsideration filed
by peitioner. Thus, the minute resolution denying the petition for being
prematurely filed.


Finally, an injunction,
as an extraordinary remedy, is not favored in labor law considering that it
generally has not proved to be an effective means of settling labor disputes.
[20]
 It has been the policy of the State
to encourage the parties to use the non-judicial process of negotiation and
compromise, mediation and arbitration.
[21]
 Thus, injunctions may be issued
only in cases of extreme necessity based on legal grounds clearly established,
after due consultations or hearing and when all efforts at conciliation are
exhausted which factors, however, are clearly absent in the present case.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby GRANTED.
The assailed Orders dated  April 3,1995
and May 31,1995, issued by the National Labor Relations Commission (First
Division), in NLRC NCR IC No. 000563-95, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
