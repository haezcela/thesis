PETITIONERS, VS., NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (THIRD DIVISION) AND
TIONGSAN SUPER BAZAAR, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


In granting this
petition, the Court relies on the following doctrines:  (1) where the conclusions of the NLRC and
the labor arbiter are conflicting, this Court may review factual findings; (2)
the employer has the burden of proof to show the validity of the dismissal; (3)
a dismissal is deemed illegal unless the employer proves (a) just or authorized
cause and (b) observance of due process; and (4) acceptance by the employee of
separation pay does not estop him from alleging the illegality of his dismissal
and from pressing for reinstatement.


The Case


This petition for 
certiorari

under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assails the Decision of the National Labor
Relations Commission
[1]
 promulgated on April 29, 1995, and its Resolution
[2]
 promulgated on September 19, 1995 denying
petitionersâ motion for reconsideration in NLRC CA No. 007894-94,
[3]
 both rendered in the consolidated cases for illegal
dismissal filed by petitioners against respondents in the Regional Arbitration
Branch of the Cordillera Administrative Region.


The assailed
Decision disposed as follows:
[4]


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
the assailed decision of the Labor Arbiter, dated 30 September 1994 is hereby
MODIFIED, as follows:ua


(a)
           
Complainant
Lilia Pascua is declared to have voluntarily resigned; hence, the finding 
a
quo 
of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of backwages and
additional separation pay pertaining to her are hereby SET ASIDE;


(b)
           
Complainant
Victoria Santos is found not to have been dismissed; hence, the finding 
a
quo
 of illegal dismissal and the consequent award of backwages pertaining
to her are hereby SET ASIDE.  However,
she is still entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, due to
strained relationship;


(c)
           
Complainant
Violeta Sorianoâs dismissal is declared to be for just cause; hence, the
finding 
a quo 
of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of
backwages and separation pay, as to her, are hereby SET ASIDE;


(d)
           
Complainant
Susan de Castro is found not to have been dismissed; hence, the finding 
a
quo
 of illegal dismissal and the consequent awards of backwages, as to her,
are hereby SET ASIDE.  However, she is
still entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement due to strained
relationship, plus her unpaid salary.


Other holdings in the appealed
decision stand AFFIRMED.â


On the other
hand, the labor arbiterâs
[5]
 disposition, dated September 30,
1994, reads:
[6]


âVIEWED FROM THIS LIGHT, judgment
is hereby rendered with the following dispositions:


1.That the complainants were illegally
dismissed.  Considering however, that,
reinstatement is no longer possible, because [of] the serious personal and
physical differences between them, respondent, should pay the complainantsâ
backwages and/or separation [pay] as follows:

PROVIDED, that, the payment of the backwages, shall
be without prejudice to any adjustment, for the purpose of deducting, the complainantsâ
earnings elsewhere during the pendency of the case;


2. That the claims for overtime pay, rest day
premiums and service incentive leave pay are denied, considering the finding of
the office of the Regional Director of DOLE-CAR, that respondent committed no
violation in so far as general labor standards are concerned; and


3. That the claims for moral and exemplary damages as
well as attorneyâs fees are denied for lack of proper basis.â


The Facts


 


The facts of the
case, as narrated by the labor arbiter and quoted by the NLRC, are as follows:
[7]


âThe complainants are among the
thirty seven (37) employees of Henry Lao at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar.  On August 7, 1991, Henry Lao received a
telephone call from a lady, who informed him, that, Lydia Navarette, one of his
sales ladies had just stolen a âSanyo Karaokeâ, the previous night.  Upon his receipt of the information, he
immediately dispatched Luisita Lavarias and Lydia Navarette to the latterâs
house and  [sic] recover the stolen
item.  When the two (2) reached
Navaretteâs house, she reasoned out, that, she did not have her keys.  Thereafter, they returned to the
bazaar.  There, Lydia Navarette made a
confession, that, there were others who were involved in the stealing of
goods.  Henry Lao, then called his other
sales ladies for a confrontation.  The
first person that he called was a certain âNoemiâ, who in turn pointed to a
certain Celia Lazo, as one of them.  Gloria Garcia was the next person to be called.  She likewise admitted her participation.  When she said that she knew the persons
involved in the pilferage or price cutting, she was required by Henry Lao to
write down their names.  Violeta Soriano
and Susan Castillo were included in her list.  The eighteen (18) sales ladies who admitted their guilt resigned.  The remaining workers were placed under the
watchful eyes of respondent.


On August 21, 1991, Lilia Pascua
was caught repairing three (3) pairs of pants, that allegedly was [sic] not
bought at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar.  The following day, she did not report for work anymore.  Instead, she went to see the respondentâs
bookkeeper and requested for the computation of her separation pay.


On August 24, 1991, barely
seventeen (17) days after the mass resignation of the 18 sales ladies, for
various offenses, Victoria Santos was caught charging a meter of a cloth for
the price of a yard.  For this offense,
she was suspended for a period of thirty (30) days.  She never returned to work since then.


Mimi Macanlalay and Violeta Soriano
were previously assigned as cashiers.  But because of their alleged acts of dishonesty, they were relieved from
their positions.  Mimi Macanlalay later
on resigned.  While Violeta Soriano was
terminated on the ground of insubordination on December 11, 1991.

THE CASE OF LILIA PASCUA:


Lilia Pascua was employed on June
2, 1985, as a saleslady.  She is [sic]
assigned at the pants section of [the] bazaar.  She is [sic] a trusted employee of respondent.  For a time, he relied on her (TSN, Henry Lao, February 7, 1994,
p. 9)  On September 21, 1991, she left
her station unattended for about three (3) hours in the afternoon.  At about the same time, respondent noticed
Mrs. Manaois, roaming around the store without buying anything.  Henry Lao closely watched her, because she
was one of the people that were conniving with the sales ladies.  At 6:00 oâ clock p.m. respondent saw Mrs.
Manaois approach Lilia Pascua at the sewing machine.  Lilia Pascua was finishing the last of the three (3) pairs of
pants that belonged to Mrs. Manaois.  (TSN, Henry Lao, February 4, 1994, p. 9)


Respondent scolded Lilia Pascua for
this offense, because it is against the respondentâs policy that repair jobs of
items that are not bought at the bazaar, should not be accepted.  She was given a warning, that this
prohibition should be strictly followed.  Lilia Pascua did not report for work the next day.  She opted to resign.  Respondent paid her separation pay.


THE CASE OF MIMI MACANLALAY:


Mimi Macanlalay was employed on
June 10, 1989.  Previously, she worked
for Mrs. Tan.  On September 19, 1991,
Mrs. Tan went to the Tiongsan Super Bazaar, and she saw Mimi Macanlalay working
as a cashier.  Mrs. Tan informed Mr.
Lao, that Mimi Macanlalay was previously dismissed by her for dishonesty.  In relieving Ms. Macanlalay from her
position as cashier, respondent ratiocinates:


xxx
     
xxx
     
xxx


âxxx (i)t is perfectly normal for
Mr. Lao to be apprehensive when he was informed by his customer friend about
the previous dismissal of complainant Macanlalay from her previous job for
dishonesty.  Considering the widescale
underpricing pilferage and deceit which was discovered only a month earlier,
Mr. Lao was naturally worried xxx.â


âUpon the admission made by
complainant, Mr. Lao, naturally had reason to doubt her honesty.  This was the reason why he informed her,
that she was returning her as sales lady.â  (See Vol. II, pp. 114-115, records of Macanlalay v-Lao cases)


Just like Lilia Pascua, Mimi
Macanlalay resigned, and was paid her separation pay.


THE CASE OF VICTORIA SANTOS:


On August 24, 1991, Victoria Santos
was caught charging a meter of a cloth for the price of a yard.  Mr. Lao immediately called her, for an
explanation.  Her explanation was found
by Mr. Lao to be unsatisfactory.  She
was suspended for thirty (30) days.


THE CASE OF VIOLETA SORIANO:


Violeta Soriano was employed on May
16, 1984.  After the August 7, 1991
incident, she was assigned as a cashier.  She was reverted back as a sales lady after a few weeks when Mr. Lao learned,
that, she had some knowledge of the schemes of the resigned employees.  On November 9, 1991, Mr. Lao required her to
explain in writing, why she should not be the subject matter of a disciplinary  action, for her failure to fill up her daily
time record.  Mr. Lao ordered another
employee to put the phrase âno entryâ into Ms. Sorianoâs daily time
record.  Ms. Soriano attempted to grab
the daily time record from its custodian.  A commotion ensued, in the presence of many customers.  She was suspended for thirty (30) days.  Respondent reviewed her past records and
found out that, she was the subject matter of a disciplinary action in the
past.  She was terminated [sic] on December
8, 1991.


THE CASE OF SUSAN DE CASTRO


Susan De Castro refused to receive her
salary on November 18, 1991, because she insisted on receiving more than what
is indicated in the payrolls.  Respondent told her, that if she is [sic] not satisfied with her salary,
she can [sic] find employment elsewhere.  She failed to report for work on the following day.  In any case, respondent states, that, she
can be dismissed for lack of trust and confidence, for her involvement in the
pilferage of goods.â


Petitioners
filed at the Regional Arbitration Branch of the NLRC
[8]
 separate complaints against Henry
Lao
[9]
for âillegal dismissal and claims
for violation of labor standards pertaining to payment of wages.â
[10]
 The parties submitted position
papers and documentary evidence, and hearings were held.  Subsequently, the labor arbiter ruled that
the dismissals were illegal and awarded back wages and separation pay to
petitioners.


Both petitioners
and respondent  appealed  to the NLRC, which modified the appealed
decision.  It found the termination of
petitionersâ employment to be due either to voluntary resignation or dismissals
with just cause; however, it awarded separation pay to Victoria Santos.  Petitionersâ motion for reconsideration was
unavailing.  Hence, this petition which
was deemed submitted for decision upon receipt by the Court of private respondentâs
memorandum on October 22, 1997
.
[11]


Respondent NLRCâs Ruling


The NLRC ruled:


âOn the bases of the foregoing, we
find that the evidence on hand preponderates for the dismissal of
complainant.  There could be no better
evidence other than the DTR itself.  Granting that there was indeed an instruction in the past for the
employees not to make regular entries in their DTRs the same should not be
expediently used as a lame excuse for the employee who defies an order from
management for him to now to make the proper entries.  Management should not be taken hostage of [sic] its previous
mistakes or apparent leniencies precluding it from instituting the necessary
and needed reforms and punishing violators thereof.


In the case at bar, there is no
dispute that an order for the employees to make regular entries in their DTRs
is lawful and that defiance thereof undoubtedly amounts to
insubordination.  Hence, complainantâs
dismissal is justified under the premises.


Besides, there is reasonable ground
to believe that complainant had indeed left for overseas employment which
explains why complainant was not able to testify on the witness stand during
the trial of the case and refute the charges of management in this regard (TSN
dated 07 February 1994, p. 8, Volume III, Records).


Insofar as the payment of overtime
pay is concerned it must be denied for lack of factual or legal basis.  Under the premises, complainants failed to
substantiate their entitlement to overtime pay by clear and convincing
evidence.  Unlike in ordering monetary
claims whereby the burden of proof rests [on] the shoulders of the employer the
same does not squarely apply in claims for overtime pay on the theory that an
employee is presumed to have been engaged to render the regular or normal eight
(8) hours of work per day.  Besides, the
mere fact that respondent committed no violation of labor standards laws per
inspection report by the Inspector Division of the Regional office concerned,
should work in his favor (p. 33, Volume I, Records).


Anent the claim for moral and
exemplary damages, suffice it to say, that even granting that the issue on
sexual harassment implicating Mr. Henry Lao was sufficiently established, the
award for said damages must still fail because the said ground relied upon by
the complainants was neither the proximate nor contributory cause of their
supposed dismissals.


Finally, we need
to stress that under Article III (a) of the Labor Code, as amended, attorneyâs
fees are recoverable only against the culpable party in case of unlawful
withholding of wages, a situation not obtaining in the case at bar.â
[12]


The Issues


In their
Memorandum,
[13]
 petitioners present the following
issues:


âWhether or not Respondent NLRC
committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction


1.
 
In reversing the finding of
illegal dismissal of the labor arbiter who observed the demeanors of the
witnesses during the trial on the merits and in supplanting its conflicting
rulings which are contrary to law and settled jurisprudence.


2.
 
In finding petitioners to have
voluntarily resigned despite complete absence of any evidence of resignation
and consequently in finding them as not illegally dismissed despite complete
absence on [sic] evidence that private respondent complied with the termination
guidelines as mandated in Article 277 (b) and Rule XIV, Book V of the Rules
Implementing the Labor Code, thus making the questioned decision as not
supported by evidence.


3.
 
In not reinstating petitioners
with full backwages and other benefits until actual reinstatement and in not
granting their money claims for underpayment of wages, overtime pay and other
benefits, claims for moral and exemplary damages and attorneyâs fees against
private respondent Henry Lao who has been established as a sexual harasser.â


At bottom, the
resolution of this case hinges on this question:  Were petitionersâ employment terminated because of resignation,
abandonment or dismissal?


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
meritorious.


Main Issue:  
Abandonment,
Resignation or Dismissal?


Petitioners
claim that they were denied due process.  In the first place, they were not even served âa formal notice of
dismissal.â  In particular, the
violation of procedural due process was manifested when Petitioner âMimi
Macanlalay x x x was summarily discharged due to a mere say-so suspicion of
dishonesty.â
[14]


Petitioners
further allege that their dismissals were âoppressive and anti-social,â
complaining that it was âoff-tangent and immaterialâ for private respondent to
discuss the âtheft and price-cutting of some employees of respondent bazaar x x
x because the offenses of some employees cannot be imputed against
petitioners.â
[15]


Petitioners
indignantly accuse the NLRC of being âbiased in favor of private respondent,â
as shown when the Commission decreed the validity of their dismissals in the
clear absence of evidence, and of issuing conflicting rulings to accommodate
respondent employer.
[16]
 Buttressing their contention,
petitioners point out that the award of separation pay expressly to Victoria
Santos and Susan de Castro and impliedly to Mimi Macanlalay
[17]
 indicates that they were illegally
dismissed because, if they were not, then they should not have been awarded any
separation pay as was done to Lilia Pascua and Violeta Soriano.
[18]


Petitioners also
allege that the NLRC abused its discretion when it ruled that they had been
âvalidly dismissed and [that they] resigned voluntarily just because they
received money from private respondent.â
[19]
 Citing 
Molave Tours Corporation
vs. NLRC, et al.
,
[20]
 
they argue that since resignation must be made with
the intent of relinquishing oneâs office, the filing of their complaints for
illegal dismissal is âwholly incompatibleâ with private respondentâs assertion
that they âvoluntarily resigned.â
[21]


Upholding public
respondent, the solicitor general contends that Petitioners Lilia Pascua,
Victoria Santos and Susan C. De Castro resigned from their jobs; that Mimi
Macanlalay voluntarily left private respondentâs employ; and that Petitioner
Violeta Soriano was dismissed for just cause.


Private
respondent, on the other hand, maintains the validity of the dismissal of the
petitioners.  It contends that the award
of separation pay â[was] not inconsistent with the finding that there [was] no
illegal dismissal since it was given by the employer as financial assistance.â
[22]


Private
respondent also insists that Petitioner Pascua clearly violated the company
rule âthat only pants bought from Tiongsan may be worked on by the employees x
x x.â
[23]
 She was not dismissed but âsimply
did not report for work and instead demanded x x x separation pay.â
[24]
 Petitioner Santos, on the other
hand, âsimply did not report back to work after serving her thirty (30) days
suspension.  Instead, she asked private
respondent to pay her separation pay computed at one (1) month pay for every
year of service.â
[25]
 Petitioner Soriano was first
suspended for causing a âcommotion inside the store in the presence of
customers.â  Later, her employment was
validly terminated.
[26]
 Petitioner De Castro âshowed gross
insubordination and hostility towards private respondent [Henry Lao].â  Though it is true that the latter  had âsuggested to her to look for employment
elsewhere, this certainly did not amount to a termination.â
[27]
 Lastly, Petitioner Macanlalay
âresigned.â
[28]


Review of Evidence in Labor Cases


As a rule,
petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 involve only jurisdictional issues, or
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  Hence, this Court refrains from reviewing
factual assessments of lower courts and agencies exercising adjudicative
functions, such as the NLRC.  Occasionally, however, this Court is constrained to wade into factual
matters when there is insufficient or insubstantial evidence on record to
support those factual findings; or when too much is concluded, inferred or
deduced from the bare or incomplete facts appearing on record.  In the present case, we find the need to
review the records to determine the facts with certainty not only because of
the foregoing inadequacies, but also because the NLRC and the labor arbiter
have come up with conflicting positions.
[29]


In the present
case, the central question is:  Was
petitionersâ employment terminated in accordance with law?  After poring over the records and the
evidence, as well as the applicable law and jurisprudence, the Court is
convinced that the answer is âNo.â


First.  
Basic is the doctrine that resignation must be voluntary and
made with the intention of relinquishing the office, accompanied with an 
act

of relinquishment.
[30]
 Based on the evidence on record, we
are more than convinced that Petitioners Lilia Pascua, Mimi Macanlalay, Susan
C. De Castro and Violeta Soriano did not voluntarily quit their jobs.  Rather, they were forced to resign or were
summarily dismissed without just cause.  Petitioners -- except Victoria L. Santos -- forthwith took steps to
protest their layoff and thus cannot, by any logic, be said to have abandoned
their work.
[31]


Second.  
In labor cases, the employer has the burden of proving that
the dismissal was for a just cause; failure to show this, as in the instant
case, would necessarily mean that the dismissal was unjustified and, therefore,
illegal.
[32]
 To allow an employer to dismiss an
employee based on  mere  allegations  and generalities would place the employee at the mercy of his employer;
and the right to security of tenure, which this Court is bound to protect,
would be unduly emasculated.
[33]
 Considering the antecedents in the
summary dismissals effected against Petitioners Pascua, Macanlalay, De Castro
and Soriano, the causes asserted by private respondent are, at best, tenuous or
conjectural; at worst, they are mere afterthoughts.


Third.  
Under the Labor Code, as amended, the dismissal of an
employee which the employer must validate has a twofold requirement:  one is substantive, the other
procedural.  Not only must the dismissal
be for a just or an authorized cause as provided by law (Articles 282, 283 and
284 of the Labor Code, as amended); the rudimentary requirements of due process
-- the opportunity to be heard and to defend oneself -- must be observed as
well.
[34]


Fourth.  
Petitioners Pascua and Macanlalayâs acceptance of separation
pay did not necessarily amount to estoppel; nor did it connote a waiver of
their right to press for reinstatement, considering that such acceptance --
particularly by Petitioner Pascua who had to feed her four children
[35]
 -- was due to dire financial
necessity.
 
[36]


Based on the
above postulates, the facts and the law as they apply to each petitioner shall
now be discussed.


Petitioners Illegally Dismissed


Lilia Pascua.
  According to the NLRC, after being caught repairing the last of three
pairs of pants which were not bought at the Tiongsan Super Bazaar, Lilia Pascua
admitted the wrongdoing to Henry Lao, explaining that she was merely
accommodating a certain Mrs. Manaois, who was allegedly Laoâs friend.  She averred:
[37]


â5.
           
That
at almost 6:30 oâ clock in the evening of August 21, 1991, a close friend of my
employers whom I know as Ms. Manaois approached me and requested me to cut and
sew the hem of her pants which I turned down;


6.
 
That
said Ms. Manaois however insisted that I work on her pants with the assurance
that she will be the one to talk to my employers anyway she is their âkumadreâ
such that with said assurance I started to put my line (âguhitâ) on the hem of
the pants at which time, Henry Lao approached us and questioned my act;â


Thereupon, she
was scolded and suspended by Lao, after which, the NLRC found, she decided to
resign from private respondentâs employ.


We cannot accept
the NLRCâs simplistic findings.  The
uncontested affidavit of Petitioner Pascua provides the evidence conveniently
ignored by the NLRC, which shows the folly of the alleged resignation:
[38]


â7.
           
That
Henry Lao shouted at me and told me to go upstairs to the counter so that I can
sign for my suspension and hurried me up by pushing me by my shoulders towards
the direction of the counter and as soon as I was there, he hurriedly let me
sign a blank paper and no copy was given to me;


8.
 
That
thereafter, Henry Lao kept pushing me by my shoulders as he repeatedly told me
in a loud manner, âpakuwenta mo na ang separation pay mo at hindi ka na rin
makakabalik.  Puntahan mo ang
accountant.â which made me nervous and afraid especially that he kept on
pushing me even when I was already on top of the stairs;


9.
 
That
on August 22, 1991, as instructed by Henry Lao, I went to the accountant for
the computation of my separation pay which she computed after which I went to
Tiong San Super Bazaar where I was paid the computed separation pay of 
P
8,010.;â  (Emphasis supplied).


It is evident
from the above that, contrary to private respondentâs allegation, Petitioner
Pascua was forced to resign -- an act which was tantamount to a dismissal, an
illegal one at that.


Was there any valid
cause for her dismissal?
[39]
 The solicitor general submits:  âIt must be pointed out that Henry Lao was
acting within his rights when he chastised and suspended petitioner for
flagrant violation of company rules.â
[40]
 We do not agree.  To be a just cause for an employeeâs
dismissal, wilful disobedience must show the following:  the employeeâs assailed conduct must have
been wilful or intentional, the wilfulness being characterized by a âwrongful
and perverse attitudeâ; and the order violated must have been reasonable,
lawful, made known to the employee and pertinent to the duties which he or she
had been engaged to discharge.  In this
light, not every case of so-called wilful disobedience by an employee can
reasonably be penalized with dismissal.
[41]


In the present
case, Petitioner Pascua was aware of the close relationship between Henry Lao
and Mrs. Manaois.  Indeed, Lao himself
did not deny that he knew Manaois.  Thus, Pascua feared that, if she turned down Mrs. Manaoisâ request, she
would be subjected to public scolding by Lao.  Thus, accommodation of the said request may have been an act of
disobedience of her employerâs order, but hardly an instance of the âwrongful
and perverse attitudeâ that would warrant a penalty as grave as dismissal.  Fairness requires that dismissal, being the
ultimate penalty that can be meted out to an employee, must have a clear basis.
[42]
 Any ambiguity in the ground for the
termination of an employee should be interpreted against the employer, who
ordained such ground in the first place.

.  Finding that she was ânot at all dismissed,â
the NLRC, as well as the labor arbiter, ruled that Petitioner De Castro was
âsimilarly situated as petitioner Santos.â  We do not agree.


First of all,
the NLRC could not explain the contradictions in Petitioner De Castroâs
case.  If she had not been dismissed but
was still an employee of private respondent, then why did she file this case
for illegal dismissal?  And even more
perplexing:  Why would the NLRC conclude
that 
reinstatement
 was no longer possible because of the partiesâ
ârespective imputations of charges against each otherâ?


Furthermore, the
labor arbiterâs finding that there was no evidence on record to establish her
dismissal is refuted by these uncontested allegations of Petitioner De Castro:
[43]


â2.
           
Complainant
Susan de Castro, in Case No. -0377-91, was also a saleslady of the Tiongsan
Super Bazaar from May 16, 1987 to November 19, 1991.  She worked every day except Mondays, her restday [sic], in nine and
a half hours (9 Â½) but she was required to fill up her daily time records
reflecting eight (8) hours work only.  Her wage rates were as follows:


P
40/day - May 16, 1987 to December 31/87


  64/day - January/88 to September 30/89


  89/day - October/89 to November 30, 1990


  99/day - December 1/90 to April 30/91


  106/day - May 1/91 to November 19, 1991.


Complainant was not paid her legal
benefits such as underpayment of basic wage, unpaid overtime pay, premiums for
restday [sic] and holiday pay, incentive leave pay and 13th month pay
differentials.  That on November 19,
1991 she was dismissed summarily, whimsically and capriciously in this
manner:  When she filled up her daily
time record correctly and demanded payment of her correct wage/overtime pay,
respondent Henry Lao flared up and said:  âHuwag ka ng pumasok? [sic] Suspended ka na!  Antayin mo na lang ang sulat ko!  You are excused, goodbye!â  And
she was not allowed to report for work anymore.â  (Emphasis supplied).


What further
muddles the issue of dismissal is the grant of separation pay.  The solicitor general contends that, since
private respondent was not averse to giving separation pay to Petitioners
Pascua and Macanlalay, it may also be required to pay separation pay to those
employees who âleave its employ.â
[44]
 The grant of separation pay,
however, is inconsistent with existing employment or voluntary resignation, for
it presupposes illegal dismissal.
[45]


The solicitor
general rationalizes the award of separation pay as one that is based on
âequitable consideration;â that is, it was for the purpose of providing
petitioner the âwherewithal during the period that she is looking for another
employment.â
[46]
 This explanation is
unacceptable.  If petitioner was legally
dismissed, as the solicitor general held, then the NLRC erred in finding her
âentitled to separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement.â  Indeed, if she was dismissed for cause,
jurisprudence demands that she should not be granted any award for the
wrongdoing she was alleged to have committed; nor is she entitled to
reinstatement and back wages.
[47]


While this Court
has allowed the grant of separation pay âas a measure of social justice,â
settled is the rule that separation pay is allowed only in those instances in
which the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious
misconduct or those involving his moral character.
[48]
 And certainly, the charge against
de Castro -- falsifying her daily time records -- involves her moral character.


Mimi
Macanlalay
.  According to the NLRC, Petitioner Macanlalay
âvoluntarily left private respondentâs employ.â  The solicitor general, in turn,  alleges that this is supported by the finding of the labor arbiter that
she âlodged her complaint, because her separation pay [was] too little.â
[49]


The evidence on
record negates resignation. Petitioner Macanlalay contends that, prior to her
employment at Tiongsan Super Bazaar, she had been a saleslady at Rommelâs which
was owned by a certain Mrs. Tan.  On
September 20, 1991, while she was working as a cashier at Tiongsan, Mrs. Tan
saw her; thereupon, Mrs. Tan reported to Henry Lao that Petitioner Macanlalay
had previously been dismissed for alleged dishonesty.  Petitioner was then called by Lao and unceremoniously told:  
âKunin mo na ang 
separation pay

mo.  Pa total mo na sa 
accountant
.  At huwag ka ng magtrabajo dito.
â
[50]
 


Clearly, she did
not resign; she was orally dismissed by Lao.  It is this lack of clear, valid and legal cause, not to mention due
process, that made her dismissal illegal, warranting reinstatement and the
award of back wages.
[51]


Violeta M.
Soriano.  
The solicitor general contends that
the two labor tribunals were correct in holding that Petitioner Soriano was
âdismissed for just causes,â namely:  (1) the omission of an entry in her daily time record and her attempt to
prevent the writing of âno entryâ thereon; (2) her reservation of certain
merchandise which she intended to purchase without informing the management;
and (3) her absences without prior approval.  Here, however, the solicitor general declares that private respondent is
subject to sanction âfor its failure to accord Petitioner Soriano the right to
an administrative investigation in conformity with the procedural requirements
of due process.â
[52]


We do not agree
with the solicitor general.  The NLRC
justified Petitioner Sorianoâs dismissal by alleging that it was due to her
failure to make regular entries in her daily time records.  We believe, however, that this alleged âjust
causeâ was convincingly disputed by Petitioner Soriano in her letter dated
November 9, 1991, which states:
[53]


âFirst, with respect to your
finding that I have not been filling up my daily time record daily, I would
like to remind you that you are the one who established said system or practice
which is applicable to all employees in your establishment with specific
instructions from you as to what working hours are supposed to be reflected
therein which is limited to only eight (8) hours a day although I and the other
employees regularly and normally render work beyond eight (8) hours daily.  With such system, you do not expect me and
my co-employees to do otherwise for fear of being charged by you for
disobedience to your instructions and consequently be the subject of persistent
harassments and unnecessary confrontations with you.  In other words, if I and my co-employees have not been filling up
our daily time record on a daily basis, it was more in accordance with your
specific instructions.  It is indeed a
surprise to me why it is only now that you are seemingly making a big issue out
of a system that you yourself has [sic] created and this time in a way that is
against me when I do not have anything to do with said system that you imposed
on me and co-employees.  Besides, this
is what I had been doing from the time I was employed in your establishment to
November 07, 1991 [in] accordance with your instructions.  It would seem however that you instructed
Dasig to fill up my daily time record by placing therein âno entryâ for the
blank spaces provided for November 3 to 7, 1991, inclusive, which I asked her
to sign but she refused to do so.  Likewise, you verbally told me today that I had to leave the premises at
5:30 p.m. and to work for only eight (8) hours which I did not do considering
that this would be a sudden change of my regular working hours.  x x xâ


The labor
arbiter sustained Petitioner Sorianoâs explanation, holding thus:
[54]


âVioleta Soriano, was first
relieved from her position as cashier, after the August 7, 1991 incident.  On October 9, 1991, she executed an
affidavit attesting that, the workers at Tiongsan Super Bazaar were
underpaid.  (See Vol. I, p. 53, record
of Lilia Pascua)  According to the
respondent, after she was relieved from her position, she refused to perform
the task, that, she had been previously doing.  When she was confronted by Mr. Lao, why she was behaving that way, she
flared up.  Due to this, she was issued
a memorandum for insubordination.  (See
Vol. II, p. 157, record of Macanlalay, et al. cases)  Another memorandum was issued on November 8, 1991, directing her
to explain why she had not been filling up her daily time records.  (See Vol. II, p. 86)  A notice of preventive suspension was issued
to her on November 10, 1991.  (See Vol.
II, p. 89)  And, finally a notice of
dismissal dated December 8, 1991.  (See
Vol. II, p. 90)


Complainant believes that these
series of memoranda, were issued by respondent only after he failed to convince
her to retract her statement that she executed in favor of Lilia Pascua.  (See Vol. II, p. 63, record of Macanlalay,
et al. v- Henry Lao)


The respondentâs decision to
dismiss is hazy.  It does not contain
any findings of fact, and the basis for the imposition of the penalty.


As evidenced by the records, there
should have been no basis for the issuance of the notice of preventive
suspension that was issued on November 10, 1991.  Granting, that, it is true that, complainant refused to receive
on November 8, 1991, (see Vol. II, p. 86) she submitted her explanation on
November 10, 1991, at 8:30 a.m. (See p. 88, 
ibid
)  There is likewise no basis for the
accusation that complainant made an unauthorized change in her lunch
break.  (See p. 89, ibid)  Respondent himself confirmed that his
salesladies were free to arrange among themselves their time.  (TSN, Henry Lao, February 10, 1994, p. 40)

It has been held, that, the
employer is possessed with an inherent right to dismiss an employee for loss of
confidence.  The Court has a plethora of
decisions that supports and recognizes this authority of the employer to sever
its relationship with the employee involving such cases.  However, loss of confidence as a valid cause
to terminate an employee must nonetheless rest on an actual breach of duty
committed by the employee and not on the employerâs imagined whim or
caprice.  The employerâs evidence must
clearly and convincingly establish the facts and incidents upon which the loss
of confidence in the employee may fairly be made to rest.  (Estiva v- NLRC, 22 SCRA 169, other
citations omitted)


The respondent failed to establish
the bases for the complainantsâ dismissal.  They were illegally dismissed.â  (Emphasis supplied).


To find a
convenient justification to dismiss an employee, Henry Lao cannot unilaterally
change the previous rule -- irregular as it may have been -- regarding entries
in daily time records without first informing petitioners, particularly
Soriano, of such change.  True, an
employee may be validly dismissed for violation of a reasonable company rule or
regulation adopted for the conduct of the companyâs business.  It is equally true, however, that company
policies and regulations are generally valid and binding on the parties and
must be complied with until finally revised or amended by competent authority.
[55]
 It is settled, too, that -- in
order that an employer may terminate the services of an employee on the ground
of wilful disobedience of the formerâs orders, regulations or instructions --
it must be established that the said orders, regulations, or instructions are
(1) reasonable and lawful, (2) 
sufficiently known to the employee
, and
(3) connected with the duties which the employee has been engaged to discharge.
[56]


Petitioner Santos Resigned


We agree that
Petitioner Santos voluntarily resigned.  The labor arbiter did not find Petitioner Santos [or Petitioner De
Castro] to have been illegally dismissed:
[57]


âRespondent states, that, Victoria
Santos and Susan de Castro were not dismissed, but if they reported back, Mr.
Lao, had valid grounds to dismiss them.  Except for the sweeping accusations, there is no evidence on record to
support their dismissal.  Therefore,
this Labor Arbiter is not in a position to declare that complainants Santos and
De Castro have forfeited their employment with respondent.â


Likewise, the
NLRC ruled that Victoria L. Santos was not dismissed.  Rather, after her suspension for âcharging for a meter of cloth
bought [at] the price of a yard,â
[58]
 she offered to resign.  The solicitor general supports this by
stating that âeven the Labor Arbiter discovered this when he ruled that âthere
[was] no evidence on record to support their [Santosâ and De Castroâs]
dismissal.ââ
[59]


Notwithstanding
his assertion that Petitioner Santos had resigned, the solicitor general
sustained the award of separation pay to her, because she had a âright to return
to private respondent bazaar,â which she could have exercised if not for her
âstrained relationshipâ
[60]
 
with its owner.


Petitioner
Santos contends that the affidavit she executed on October  9, 1991 caused her illegal summary
dismissal.
[61]
 
As correctly found by the NLRC, this
allegation defies logic, because Petitioner Santos was dismissed on September
25, 1991, that is, prior to the execution of said affidavit.


Damages and Attorneyâs Fees


Moral damages
are recoverable where the dismissal of the employee was attended by bad faith
or constituted an act oppressive to labor or was done in a manner contrary to
morals, good customs or public policy.
[62]
 Although the Labor Code is silent
on the liability of an employer for damages in case the termination of
employment is declared to be unjust, we have ruled,
[63]
 however, that the employer may be
so liable if, in terminating the employment, it also committed an antisocial
and oppressive abuse of its right to investigate and dismiss its employee in
violation of Article 1701 of the Civil Code.
[64]
 Thus, in 
CLLC E.G. Gochangco
Workers Union vs. NLRC,
[65]
 we said:


âAs for moral damages, we hold the
said respondent liable therefor under the provisions of Article 2220 of the
Civil Code providing for damages for âbreaches of contract where the defendant
acted fraudulently or in bad faith.â  We
deem just and proper the sum of 
P
5,000.00 each in favor of the
terminated workers, in the concept of such damages.â


In cases
involving breaches of contracts, moral damages may also be awarded where the
defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.
[66]
 Good faith refers to a state of
mind, which is manifested by the acts of the individual concerned.  It consists of an intention to abstain from
taking an unconscionable and unscrupulous advantage of another.
[67]
 Henry Laoâs dismissals of
petitioners, except Santos who resigned, was marked by precipitate dispatch and
utter disregard of due process. Clearly, Lao abused his position as an
employer. 


It is
well-settled that, for dismissals to be valid, not only must employers show
sufficient ground therefor, but must also prove that they observed procedural
due process by giving their employees two notices -- 
first,
 of the
intention to dismiss, indicating therein their acts or omissions complained
against; and, 
second,
 of the decision to dismiss â and, in between such
notices, an opportunity for them to answer and rebut the charges against them.
[68]
 In the present case, not only was
private respondentâs dismissal of petitioners without just cause; it was also
without procedural due process.


Attorneyâs fees
may likewise be awarded, for concerned petitioners were dismissed in bad faith.
[69]
 Petitioner Pascua was summarily
dismissed.  Petitioner De Castro was also
dismissed without due process after she demanded to be paid her correct wages
as mandated by labor laws.  Petitioner
Soriano, in spite of her explanation in answer to the capricious charges raised
by Henry Lao, was still summarily dismissed.  Attorneyâs fees may be awarded when petitioners, illegally dismissed in
bad faith, are compelled to litigate or incur expenses to protect their rights
by reason of the acts and the omissions of their employer.
[70]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
GRANTED 
and
the assailed Decision and Resolution are hereby 
REVERSED 
and 
SET
ASIDE
.  Petitioners Pascua,
Macanlalay, De Castro and Soriano are 
FOUND
 to have been illegally
dismissed.  Private respondents are 
ORDERED

to 
REINSTATE
 them immediately without loss of seniority rights
and  with  full  back  wages  and  other benefits from the time
of their illegal dismissal up to the time of their actual reinstatement,
[71]
 but the amounts already paid to
Petitioners Pascua and Macanlalay shall be deducted from the sums respectively
due them. Each illegally dismissed petitioners is 
AWARDED 
P
25,000
as moral damages plus ten percent of the total sum as and for attorneyâs
fees.  Having voluntarily resigned,
Petitioner Santos is not entitled to the awards given to other petitioners.  However, inasmuch as the private respondent
did not appeal, it is bound by the NLRCâs disposition in regard to Santos.
[72]
 No costs.
