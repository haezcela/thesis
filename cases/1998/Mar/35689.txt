CRESENTE Y. LLORENTE, JR., PETITIONER,
VS. SANDIGANBAYAN AND LETICIA G. FUERTES, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


In a prosecution
for violation of Section 3[e] of the Anti-Graft Law, that is, âcausing undue
injury to any party,â the government prosecutors must prove âactualâ injury to
the offended party; speculative or incidental injury is not sufficient.


The Case


Before us is a
petition for review of the Decision promulgated on June 23, 1995 and the
Resolution promulgated on October 12, 1995 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal
Case No. 18343, finding Cresente Y. Llorente, Jr. guilty as charged.


Llorente, then
municipal mayor of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte, was charged with violation
of Sec. 3[e] of Republic Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act, under an Information dated October 22, 1992, textually
reproduced as follows:
[1]


âThat in or about and
during the period of July, 1990 to October, 1991, or for sometime subsequent
thereto, in the Municipality of Sindangan, Province of Zamboanga del Norte,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused Cresente Y. Llorente, Jr., a public officer, being then the
Mayor of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte, in the exercise of his official and
administrative functions, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and
criminally with evident bad faith refuse to sign and approve the payrolls and
vouchers representing the payments of the salaries and other emoluments of
Leticia G. Fuertes, without just valid cause and without due process of law,
thereby causing undue injury to the said Leticia G. Fuertes.


CONTRARY
TO LAW.â


Duly arraigned
on March 29, 1993, petitioner, with the assistance of counsel, entered a plea
of âNOT GUILTY.â
[2]
 After trial in due course, the
Sandiganbayan
[3]
 rendered the assailed Decision,
disposing as follows:
[4]


âWHEREFORE, judgment is
hereby rendered finding accused Mayor Cresente Y. Llorente, Jr. GUILTY beyond
reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of Violation of Section 3(e) of
Republic Act 3019, as amended, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer
imprisonment of SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) MONTH, as minimum to SEVEN (7) YEARS,
as maximum; to further suffer perpetual disqualification from public office;
and to pay the costs.â


Respondent Court
denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration in the assailed Resolution,
thus:
[5]


âWHEREFORE, accusedâs
âMotion for Reconsideration and/or New Trialâ is hereby DENIED for lack of
merit.  His âMotion for Marking of
Additional Exhibits Cum Offer of Documentary Exhibits in Support of Motion for
Reconsideration and/or New Trialâ is now rendered moot and academic.â


Hence, this
petition.
[6]


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


As found by
Respondent Court, the prosecutionâs version of the facts of this case is as
follows:
[7]


âAfter appreciating all the
evidence on both sides, the following uncontroverted facts may be gleaned:


1.
      
Accused
Mayor Cresente Y. Llorente, Jr., at the time the alleged act was committed, was
the Municipal Mayor of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte.


2.
      
Private
[C]omplainant, Leticia C. Fuertes, is the duly appointed Assistant Municipal
Treasurer in the same municipality since October 18, 1985.


3.
      
Starting
1986, private complainant was detailed to different offices, as follows:


(a)
         
Municipality
of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte â from April, 1986 to August, 1987 as OIC
Municipal Treasurer.


(b)
         
Municipality
of Roxas, Zamboanga del Norte â from September, 1987 to March, 1988 as OIC
Municipal Treasurer.


(c)
         
Office
of the Provincial Treasurer of Zamboanga del Norte â from April, 1988 to May,
1988.


(d)
         
Municipality
of PiÃ±an, Zamboanga del Norte â from June, 1988 to June, 1990 as OIC Municipal
Treasurer.


4.
      
In
July, 1990, she was returned to her post as Assistant Municipal Treasurer in
the town of Sindangan.


She was not provided with
office table and chair nor given any assignment; neither her daily time record
and application for leave acted upon by the municipal treasurer per instruction
of accused Mayor (Exh. âG-2â; âG-3â).


5.
     
On July 23, 1990, the Sangguniang Bayan of Sindangan, Zamboanga
del Norte, presided by accused Mayor, passed Resolution No. SB â 214 (Exh.
â3â), vehemently objecting to the assignment of complainant as Assistant
Municipal Treasurer of Sindangan.


6.
     
On March 12, 1991, accused Municipal Mayor received a letter (SB
Resolution No. 36) from the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of PiÃ±an,
demanding from the private complainant return of the amount overpaid to her as
salaries (par. 9, p. 2 of Exh. â4â â counter-affidavit of accused Mayor).


7.
     
On May 22, 1991, private complainant filed a Petition for
Mandamus with Damages (Exh. âEâ) against the accused Mayor and the Municipality
of Sindangan before Branch II, Regional Trial Court of Sindangan, Zamboanga del
Norte docketed as Special Proceedings No. 45, for the alleged unjustified
refusal of Mayor Llorente to sign and/or approve her payrolls and/or vouchers
representing her salaries and other emoluments as follows: (a) salary for the
month of June, 1990 in the amount of 
P
5,452.00 under disbursement
voucher dated September 5, 1990 (Exh. âHâ).  Although complainant rendered services at the municipality of PiÃ±an
during this period, she could not collect her salary there considering that as
of that month, PiÃ±an had already appointed an Assistant Municipal
Treasurer.  When she referred the matter
to the Provincial Auditor, she was advised to claim her salary for that month
with her mother agency, the Municipality of Sindangan, [(]p. 12, TSN of August
9, 1994; 10th paragraph of complainantâs Supplemental Affidavit marked Exh.
âGâ); (b) salary differential for the period from July 1, 1989 to April 30,
1990 in the total amount of 
P
19,480.00 under disbursement voucher dated
August, 1990 (Exh. âIâ); (c) 13th month pay, cash gift and clothing allowance
under Supplemental Budget No. 5, CY 1990 in the total amount of 
P
7,275
per disbursement voucher dated December 4, 1990 (Exh. âJâ); (d) vacation leave
commutation for the period from October  to December 31, 1990 in the total amount of 
P
16,356.00 per
disbursement voucher dated December 3, 1990 (Exh. âKâ); (e) RATA for the months
of July, August and September, 1990, January and February, 1991 in the total
amount of 
P
5,900.00 (par. 12 & 16 of Exh. âEâ); and (f) salaries for
January and February, 1991 in the total amount of 
P
10,904.00 (par. 17 of
Exh. âEâ).


8.
     
Accused Mayor did not file an answer; instead, he negotiated for
an amicable settlement of the case (p. 24, TSN of August 10, 1994).  Indeed, a Compromise Agreement (Exh. âAâ)
dated August 27, 1991, between the accused and private complainant was
submitted to and approved by the court, hereto quoted as follows:


âCOMPROMISE AGREEMENT


âThat the parties have agreed, as
they hereby agree, to settle this case amicably on the basis of the following
terms and conditions, to wit:


â(a)
        
That the respondent Mayor Cresente Y. Llorente, Jr. binds
himself to sign and/or approve all vouchers and/or payrolls for unpaid
salaries, RATA, Cash-gifts, 13th month pay, clothing allowance, salary
differentials and other emoluments which the petitioner is entitled is
Assistant Municipal Treasurer of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte;


â(b)
        
That the parties herein hereby waive, renounce and relinquish
their other claims and counter-claims against each other;


â(c)
        
That the respondent Mayor Cresente Y. Llorente Jr. binds
himself to sign and/or approve all subsequent vouchers and payrolls of the
herein petitioner.â


9.
     
On August 27, 1991, a Decision (Exh. âBâ) was rendered by Judge
Wilfredo Ochotorena on the basis of the aforesaid compromise agreement.


10.
    
For his failure to comply with the terms of the compromise
agreement, private complainant, thru counsel, filed a Motion for Execution on
September 12, 1991.  A Writ of Execution
(Exh. âCâ) was issued by the Court on September  17, 1991, and served [on] the accused on September 23, 1991.


11.
    
As shown in the Sheriffâs Return dated November 19, 1991 (Exh.
âDâ), private complainant was paid her salaries for the period from January,
1991 to August, 1991, while the rest of her salaries including the RATA and
other emoluments were not paid considering the alleged need of a supplemental
budget to be enacted by the Sangguniang Bayan of Sindangan per verbal
allegation of the municipal treasurer.


12.
    
Complainant was not also paid her salaries from July to December
1990; September and October, 1991; RATA for the period from July 1990 to June
1994 (admission of accused, pp. 8-9, TSN of June 27, 1994, a.m.; Exh. âEâ; p.
17, TSN of June 27, 1994).


13.
    
Sometime in 1993, accused municipal mayor received from the
Municipality of PiÃ±an, Bill No. 93-08 (Exh. â1â), demanding from the
Municipality of Sindangan settlement of overpayment to complainant Fuertes in
the amount of P50,643.93 per SB Resolution No. 6 sent on July 23, 1990.  The bill was settled by the Municipality of
Sindangan in December, 1993 per Disbursement Voucher No. 101-9312487 dated
December 2, 1993 (Exh. â2â).


14.
    
Private complainant was able to receive complete payment of her
claims only on January 4, 1993 in the form of checks all dated December 29,
1992 (as appearing on Exhs. âHâ, âIâ, âJâ, âKâ of the prosecution, Exhs. â6â,
â7â, â8â, of the defense) except her RATA which was given to her only on July
25, 1994, covering the period from July 1990 to December, 1993 amounting to
P55,104.00, as evidenced by Disbursement Voucher dated July 25, 1994 (Exh.
â5â).â


Version of the Defense


While admitting
some delays in the payment of the complainantâs claims, petitioner sought to
prove the defense of good faith -- that the withholding of payment was due to
her failure to submit the required money and property clearance, and to the
Sangguniang Bayanâs delayed enactment of a supplemental budget to cover the
claims.  He adds that such delays did
not result in âundue injuryâ to complainant.  In his memorandum, petitioner restates the facts as follows:
[8]


â1.
    
Complainant xxx was appointed assistant municipal treasurer of
Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte on October 18, 1985.  However, starting 1986 until July 1990, or for a period of about
four (4) and one half (1/2) years, she was detailed in other municipalities and
in the Office of the Provincial Treasurer of Zamboanga del Norte.  She returned as assistant treasurer of
Sindangan in July 1990. (Decision, pp. 5-6).


2.
     
As complainant had been working in municipallities and offices
other than in Sindangan for more than four (4) years, her name was removed from
the regular payroll of Sindangan, and payment of past salaries and other
emoluments had to be done by vouchers.  When complainant xxx presented her vouchers to petitioner, the latter
required her to submit clearances from the different offices to which she was
detailed, as well as a certificate of last payment as required by COA
regulations (Tsn, p. 11, Aug. 10, 1994).  Instead of submitting the required documents, Mrs. Fuertes said that
âwhat I did, I endorsed my voucher to the mayor through the municipal
treasurerâ (Tsn, p. 13, June 27, 1994).  The municipal  treasurer could
not, however, process the vouchers and certify as to the availability of funds until
after the Sangguniang Bayan had passed a supplemental budget for the purpose  (Exhs. D and 6-c Motion), which came only in
December 1992.


3.
     
Petitioner, in the meanwhile, received on March 12, 1991 SB
Resolution No. 36 from the Municipality of Pinan, demanding from Mrs. xxx
Fuertes the reimbursement of 
P
105,915.00, and because of this demand, he
needed time to verify the matter before acting on Mrs. Fuertesâ claims (Exh.
4).  Mrs. Fuertes admitted that she had
at the time problems of accountability with the Municipality of Pinan.  She testified:


âQ.
  
Counsel
now is asking you, when you went back to Sindangan there was [sic] still
problems of the claims either against you or against the Municipality of
Sindangan by the municipalities had, [sic] in their minds, overpaid you?


A.
   
Yes,
your Honor, that was evidence[d] by the bill of the Municipality of Pinan to
the Municipality of Sindangan.â (Tsn, p. 18, Aug. 3, 194).


4.
     
Petitioner also stated that he could not act on complainantâs
claims because she had not submitted the required money and property accountability
clearance from Pinan (Tsn, 11, Aug. 10, 1994) and that at the time the
Sangguniang Bayan had not appropriated funds for the purpose. (Tsn, pp. 18, 30,
42-43, Aug. 10, 1994).  Nonetheless,
petitioner included Mrs. Fuertesâ name in the regular annual budget beginning
1991 (Exhs. 4-b, 4-d, 4-f), as a result of which she had been since then
receiving her regular monthly salary.


5.
     
On May 21, 1991, Mrs. Fuertes filed a complaint xxx.  Petitioner filed his answer to the
complaint, alleging as a defense, that plaintiff did not exhaust administrative
remedies. (Annex B, p. 3, Petition; Exh. 1-Motion).  On August 27, 1991, the parties entered into a compromise
agreement, which the trial court approved (Exh. B).  x x x.


6. Upon motion of counsel
for Mrs. Fuertes, the trial court issued a writ of execution of the compromise
judgment.  However, the writ of
execution was addressed only to petitioner; it was not served on the municipal
Sangguniang Bayan.  x x x.


Thus, Mrs. Fuertes had been
receiving her regular salary from January, 1991 because petitioner had included
her name in the regular budget beginning 1991, which fact complainant did not
dispute.  With respect to her other
claims for past services in other offices, Municipal Treasurer, Mrs. Narcisa
Caber, informed that a supplemental budget for such purpose to be passed by the
Sangguniang Bayan was necessary before she could be paid thereof.  Being the municipal treasurer, Mrs. Caber
knew that without such supplemental budget, payment of Mrs. Fuertesâ other
claims could not be made because the law requires that âdisbursements shall be
made in accordance with the ordinance authorizing the annual or supplemental
appropriationsâ (Sec. 346, RA 7160) and that âno money shall be disbursed
unless xxx the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the
purpose.â (Sec. 344, RA 7160).


7.
     
Petitioner had instructed the municipal budget officer to
prepare the supplemental budget for payment of complainantâs unpaid claims for
submission to the Sangguniang [Bayan] for enactment. (Tsn, pp. 32-33, Aug. 10,
1994).  The budget officer, Mr. Narciso
Siasico stated as follows:


â1.
          
I am the budget officer for the Municipality of Sindangan,
Zamboanga del Norte, a position I have held since 1981.


xxx
      
xxx
                          
xxx


3.
          
Immediately after said mandamus case was settled through a
compromise agreement, Mayor Llorente instructed me to prepare the necessary
budget proposals for the deliberation and approval of the Sangguniang Bayan;


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx.â


8.
     
Instead of waiting for the Sangguniang Bayan to enact the budget
or of securing an 
alias 
writ of execution to compel the Sangguniang
Bayan to pass the same, Mrs. Fuertes filed a criminal complaint with the Office
of the Ombudsman under date of October 28, 1991, admitting receipt of her
salaries from January 1991 and saying she had not been paid her other claims in
violation of the compromise judgment.  (Exh. F).  She had thus made the
Office of the Ombudsman a collecting agency to compel payment of the judgment
obligation.


9.
     
While the budget proposal had been prepared and submitted to the
Sangguniang Bayan for action, it took time for the Sangguniang Bayan to pass
the supplemental budget and for the Provincial Board to approve the same.  It was only on December 27, 1992 that the
municipal treasurer and the municipal accountant issued a certification of
availability of funds for the purpose.  Petitioner approved the vouchers immediately, and in a period of one
week, Mrs. Fuertes was paid all claims, as evidenced by the prosecutionâs Exhs.
H, I, J and K, which were the four vouchers of Mrs. Fuertes, xxxx.


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx


11.
    
Petitioner testified that he could not immediately sign or
approve the vouchers of Mrs. Fuertes for the following reasons:


âa)
          
The Sangguniang Bayan had not appropriated the amounts to
pay Mrs. Fuertes. (Tsn, pp. 18, 30, 42-43, Aug. 10, 1994).


b)
          
Municipal Treasurer Caber, to whom Mrs. Fuertes endorsed
her vouchers for processing, and the Municipal Accountant issued the
certificate of availability of funds only on December 27, 1992 (Tsn, p. 42,
Aug. 10, 1994; Exhs. H, I, J and K); and the delay in the issuance of the
certificate of availability of funds was due to the delay by the Provincial
Board to approve the supplemental budget. (Tsn, p. 43, Aug. 10, 1994).


[c])
    
He received on March 12, 1991 a demand from
the Municipality of Pinan, Zamboanga del Norte, where Mrs. Fuertes last worked,
for the reimbursement of P105,915.00, and the matter had to be clarified first.
(Exh. 4).  Mrs. Fuertes admitted that
she had some problem of accountability with the Municipality of Pinan. (Tsn, p.
18, 1994).  It took time before this
matter could be clarified by the Municipality of Pinan reducing its claim to
P50,647.093 and the Municipality of Sindangan paying said claim. (Exh. 2;
Decision, p. 9).


[d])
    
Mrs. Fuertes had not submitted the required
clearance from the Municipality of Pinan. (Tsn, p. 11, Aug. 10, 1994).  He did not insist on this requirement after
the trial court issued the writ of execution to implement the compromise
judgment. (Tsn, p. 23, Aug. 10, 1994).  Nonetheless, in the post audit of Mrs. Fuertesâ accountability, the
Commission on Audit issued a notice of suspension of the amount of P5,452.00
from Mrs. Fuertes for her failure to submit: â1. Clearance for money &
property accountability from former office. 2. Certification as [sic] last day
of service in former office. 3. Certification of last salary received &
issued by the disbursing officer in former office, certified by chief
accountant and verified by resident auditor.â (Exh. 2-Motion).


12.
    
The Information dated October 12, 1992 filed against petitioner
alleged that petitioner as mayor did not sign and approve the vouchers of Mrs.
Fuertes for payment of her salaries and other emoluments from July 1, 1990 to
October 1991, which caused her undue injury.  However, the prosecutionâs Exh. âDâ, the sheriffâs return dated November
19, 1991, stated that Mrs. Fuertes had received her salary from January 1, 1991
âup to the presentâ, which meant that even before the information was filed,
she had been paid her regular salaries from January 1, 1991 to October
1991.  The supplemental budget to cover
payment of her other claims for past services was passed only in December 1992
and the municipal treasurer and accountant issued the certificate of
availability of funds only on December 27, 1992, and Mrs. Fuertes got paid of
[sic] all her other claims, including those not claimed in the Information,
within one week therefrom. (Exhs. H, I, J, and K).

xxx.â


Ruling of the Sandiganbayan


Respondent Court
held that the delay or withholding of complainantâs salaries and emoluments was
unreasonable and caused complainant undue injury.  Being then the sole breadwinner in their family, the withholding
of her salaries caused her difficulties in meeting her familyâs financial
obligations like paying for the tuition fees of her four children.  Petitionerâs defense that complainant failed
to attach the required money and property clearance to her vouchers was held to
be an afterthought that was brought about, in the first place, by his own
failure to issue any memorandum requiring its submission.  That the voucher form listed the clearance
as one of the requirements for its approval had neither been brought to
complainantâs attention, nor raised by petitioner as defense in his
answer.  In any event, the payment of
complainantâs salary from January to November 1991, confirmed by the sheriffâs
return, showed that the clearance was not an indispensable requirement, because
petitioner could have acted upon or approved the disbursement even without
it.  The alleged lack of a supplemental
budget was also rejected, because it was petitionerâs duty as municipal mayor
to prepare and submit the âexecutive and supplemental budgetsâ under Sections
318, 320, and 444 (3)(ii) of the Local Government Code,
[9]
 and the complainantâs claims as
assistant municipal treasurer, a permanent position included in the plantilla
for calendar year 1990 and 1991, were classified as âcurrent operating
expendituresâ for the same calendar years, which were chargeable against the
general funds of the town of Sindangan.  Except for the representation and transportation allowance, Fuertesâ
claims for thirteenth month pay, cash gift and clothing allowance were already
covered by Supplemental Budget No. 5 for calendar year 1990.  Petitionerâs contention that funds covering
complainantâs claims were made available only in December 1992 was
unbelievable, considering that an ordinance enacting a supplemental budget
takes effect upon its approval or on the date fixed therein under Sec. 320 of
the Local Government Code.


The
Sandiganbayan also ruled that the petitionerâs evident bad faith was the direct
and proximate cause of Fuertesâ undue injury.  Complainantâs salaries and allowances were withheld for no valid or
justifiable reasons.  Such delay was
intended to harass complainant, because petitioner wanted to replace her with
his political protege whom he eventually designated as municipal treasurer,
bypassing Fuertes who was next in seniority.  Bad faith was further evidenced by petitionerâs instructions to the
outgoing municipal treasurer not to give the complaining witness any work
assignment, not to provide her with office table and chair, not to act on her
daily time record and application for leave of absence, instructions which were
confirmed in the municipal treasurerâs certification. (Exh. G-2).


The Issues


In his
memorandum, petitioner submits the following issues:
[10]


â1.
    
Could accused be held liable under Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019 âin the
discharge of his official administrative dutiesâ, a positive act, when what was
imputed to him was failing and refusing to sign and/or approve the vouchers of
Mr[s]. Fuertes on time or by âinaction on his obligation under the compromise
agreementâ 
(ibid
., p. 19), a passive act?  Did not the act come under Sec. 3(f) of R.A. 3019, of [sic] which
accused was not charged with?


2.
     
Assuming, 
arguendo, 
that his failure and refusal to
immediately sign and approve the vouchers of Mrs. Fuertes comes [sic] under
Sec. 3(e), the questions are:


(a)
     
Did
not the duty to sign and approve the same arise only after the Sangguniang
Bayan had passed an appropriations ordinance, and not before?  In other words, was the non-passage of the
appropriation ordinance a justifiable reason for not signing the vouchers?


(b)
     
Did
Mrs. Fuertes suffer undue injury, as the term is understood in Sec. 3(e), she
having been paid all her claims?

Did
petitioner not act in good faith in refusing to immediately sign the vouchers
and implement the compromise agreement until the Sangguniang Bayan had enacted
the appropriation ordinance and until Mrs. Fuertes submitted the clearance from
the Municipality of Pinan, Zamboanga del Norte?â


Restated,
petitioner claims that the prosecution failed to establish the elements of
undue injury and bad faith.  Additionally, petitioner submits that a violation of Section 3[e] of RA
3019 cannot be committed through nonfeasance.


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
meritorious.  After careful review of
the evidence on record and thorough deliberation on the applicable provision of
the Anti-Graft Law, the Court agrees with the solicitor generalâs assessment
that the prosecution failed to establish the elements of the crime charged.


First Issue:  
Undue
Injury


Petitioner was
charged with violation of Section 3[e] of R.A. 3019, which states:


âSEC. 3. 
Corrupt
practices of public officers.â
In addition to acts or omissions of public
officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute
corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx


(e)
    
Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government,
or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference
in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through
manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.  This provision shall apply to officers and
employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of
licenses or permits or other concessions.â


To hold a person liable under this section, the concurrence of the
following elements must be established beyond reasonable doubt by the
prosecution:


â(1) that the accused is a
public officer or a private person charged in conspiracy with the former;


(2) that said public
officer commits the prohibited acts during the performance of his or her
official duties or in relation to his or her public positions;


(3) that he or she causes
undue injury to any party, whether the government or a private party; and 


(4)
    
 that the public officer has acted with
manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.â
[11]


The solicitor
general, in his manifestation,
[12]
 points out that âundue injuryâ
requires proof of actual injury or damage, citing our ruling in 
Alejandro
vs. People
[13]
 
and 
Jacinto vs. Sandiganbayan.
[14]
 Inasmuch as complainant was
actually paid all her claims, there was thus no âundue injuryâ established.


This point is
well-taken.  Unlike in actions for
torts, undue injury in Sec. 3[e] cannot be presumed even after a wrong or a
violation of a right has been established.  Its existence must be proven as one of the elements of the crime.  In fact, the causing of undue injury, or the
giving of any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference through manifest
partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence constitutes the
very act punished under this section.  Thus, it is required that the undue injury be specified, quantified and
proven to the point of moral certainty.


In
jurisprudence, âundue injuryâ is consistently interpreted as âactual
damage.â  
Undue
 has been defined
as âmore than necessary, not proper, [or] illegal;â and 
injury 
as âany
wrong or damage done to another, either in his person, rights, reputation or
property[;] [that is, the] invasion of any legally protected interest of
another.â  Actual damage, in the context
of these definitions, is akin to that in civil law.
[15]


In turn, actual
or compensatory damages is defined by Article 2199 of the Civil Code as
follows:


âArt. 2199.  Except as provided by law or by stipulation,
one is entitled to an adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss
suffered by him as he has duly proved.  Such compensation is referred to as actual or compensatory damages.â


Fundamental in
the law on damages is that one injured by a breach of a contract, or by a 
wrongful
or negligent act or omission
 shall have a fair and just compensation
commensurate to the loss sustained as a consequence of the defendantâs
act.  Actual pecuniary compensation is
awarded as a general rule, except where the circumstances warrant the allowance
of other kinds of damages.
[16]
 Actual damages are primarily
intended to simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong.
[17]


Furthermore,
damages must not only be capable of proof, but must be actually proven with a
reasonable degree of certainty.  They
cannot be based on flimsy and non-substantial evidence or upon speculation,
conjecture or guesswork.
[18]
 They cannot include speculative damages
which are too remote to be included in an accurate estimate of the loss or
injury.


In this case,
the complainant testified that her salary and allowance for the period
beginning July 1990 were withheld, and that her family underwent financial
difficulty which resulted from the delay in the satisfaction of her claims.
[19]
 As regards her money claim, payment
of her salaries from January 1991 until November 19, 1991 was evidenced by the
Sheriffâs Return dated November 19, 1991 (Exh. D).  She also admitted having been issued a check on January 4, 1994
to cover her salary from June 1 to June 30, 1990; her salary differential from
July 1, 1989 to April 30, 1990; her thirteenth-month pay; her cash gift; and
her clothing allowances.  Respondent
Court found that all her monetary claims were satisfied.  After she fully received her monetary
claims, there is no longer any basis for compensatory damages or undue injury,
there being nothing more to compensate.


Complainantâs testimony
regarding her familyâs financial stress was inadequate and largely
speculative.  Without giving specific
details, she made only vague references to the fact that her four children were
all going to school and that she was the breadwinner in the family.  She, however, did not say that she was
unable to pay their tuition fees and the specific damage brought by such
nonpayment.  The fact that the âinjuryâ
to her family was unspecified or unquantified does not satisfy the element of
undue injury, as akin to actual damages.  As in civil cases, actual damages, if not supported by evidence on
record, cannot be considered.
[20]


Other than the
amount of the withheld salaries and allowances which were eventually received,
the prosecution failed to specify and to prove any other loss or damage
sustained by the complainant.  Respondent Court insists that complainant suffered by reason of the
âlong period of timeâ that her emoluments were withheld.  


This
inconvenience, however, is not constitutive of undue injury.   In 
Jacinto, 
this Court held that the
injury suffered by the complaining witness, whose salary was eventually
released and whose position was restored in the plantilla, was negligible;
undue injury entails damages that are more than necessary or are excessive,
improper or illegal.
[21]
 In 
Alejandro, 
the Court held
that the hospital employees were not caused undue injury, as they were in fact
paid their salaries.
[22]


Second Issue:  
No
Evident Bad Faith


In the
challenged Decision, Respondent Court found evident bad faith on the part of
the petitioner, holding that, without any valid or justifiable reason, accused
withheld the payment of complainantâs salaries and other benefits for almost
two (2) years, demonstrating a clear manifestation of bad faith.
[23]
 It then brushed aside the
petitionerâs defenses that complainant failed to submit money and property
clearances for her vouchers, and that an appropriation by the Sangguniang Bayan
was required before complainantâs vouchers could be approved.  It said:
[24]


âSecondly, his reliance on
the failure of complainant to submit the clearances which were allegedly
necessary for the approval of vouchers is futile in the light of the foregoing
circumstances:


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx


b.
      
The
evidence on record shows that complainantâs salaries for the period from
January to November 1991 (included as subject matter in the mandamus case) were
duly paid, as confirmed in the Sheriffâs Return dated November 19, 1991 (Exh.
âDâ).  This means that accused, even
without the necessary clearance, could have acted upon or approved
complainantâs disbursement vouchers if he wanted to.


c.
      
It
may be true that a clearance is an indispensable requirement before complainant
will be paid of her claims, but accused could not just hide behind the cloak of
the clearance requirement in order to exculpate himself from liability.  As the approving officer, it was his duty to
direct complainant to submit the same.  Moreover, accused could not just set aside the obligation he voluntarily
imposed upon himself when he entered into a compromise agreement binding
himself to sign complainantâs vouchers without any qualification as to the
clearance requirement.  Perforce, he
could have seen to it that complainant secured the same in order that he could
comply with the said obligation.


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx


Fourthly, accusedâs contention that
the delay in the release of complainantâs claim could not be attributed to him
because the vouchers were only submitted to him for his signature on December
24-27, 1992; that the approval of the budget appropriations/resolutions depends
on the Sangguniang Bayan, Budget Officer and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, is
unavailing.


As revealed in the alleged newly
discovered evidence themselves, particularly x x x SB Res. No. 202 and
Appropriation Ordinance No. 035, both dated May 21, 1990 (Exh. â5-aâ- Motion),
the Sangguniang Bayan appropriated a budget of 
P
5M in the General Fund
for calendar year 1991 [the Budget Officer does not approve the budget but
assists the Municipal Mayor and the Sangguniang Bayan in the preparation of the
budget (Sec. 475, Local Government Code of 1991)].  Complainantâs claims consisted of her salaries and other benefits
for 1990 and 1991 which were classified as Current Operating Expenditures
chargeable against the General Fund.  It
is undisputed that she was holding her position as Assistant Municipal
Treasurer in a permanent capacity (her position was also designated Assistant
Department Head), which was included in the plantilla for calender years 1990
and 1991 (Exhs. â4-aâ & '4-b', Motion).  In Program Appropriation and Obligation by Object (Exhs. â4-câ &
â4-câ, Motion), appropriations were made for current operating expenditures to
which complainantâs claims properly appertained.  xxx.  Verily,
complainantâs claims were covered by appropriations duly approved by the
officials concerned, signifying that adequate funds were available for the
purpose.  In fact, even complainantâs
claims for her 13
th
 month pay, cash gift and clothing allowance,
subject matter of Disbursement Voucher marked Exhibit âJâ which would need a
supplemental budget was covered by âSupplemental Budget No. 5 for CY 1990 duly
approved by the authorities concernedâ as shown in the voucher itself.  This means that the said claim was already
obligated (funds were already reserved for it) as of calendar year 1990.
xxxx.  It is clear, then, that as
regards availability of funds, there was no obstacle for the release of all the
complainantâs claims.â


The Court
disagrees.  Respondent Court cannot
shift the blame on the petitioner, when it was the complainant who failed to
submit the required clearance.  This
requirement, which the complainant disregarded, was even printed at the back of
the very vouchers sought to be approved.  As assistant municipal treasurer, she ought to know that this is a
condition for the payment of her claims.  This clearance is required by Article 443 of the Implementing Rules and
Regulations of the Local Government Code of 1991:


âArt. 443.  
Property Clearances
 â When an
employee transfers to another government office, retires, resigns, is
dismissed, or is separated from the service, he shall be required to secure
supplies or property clearance from the supply officer concerned, the
provincial or city general services officer concerned, the municipal mayor and
the municipal treasurer, or the punong barangay and the barangay treasurer, as
the case may be.  The local chief
executive shall prescribe the property clearance form for this purpose.â


For her own
failure to submit the required clearance, complainant is not entirely blameless
for the delay in the approval of her claims.


Also, given the
lack of corresponding appropriation ordinance and certification of availability
of funds for such purpose, petitioner had the duty not to sign the
vouchers.  As chief executive of the
municipality Llorente could not have approved the voucher for the payment of
complainantâs salaries under Sec. 344, Local Government Code of 1991.
[25]
 Also, Appropriation Ordinance No.
020
[26]
 adding a supplemental budget for
calendar year 1990 was approved on April 10, 1989, or almost a year before
complainant was transferred back to Sindangan.  Hence, she could not have been included therein.  SB Resolution No. 202 and Appropriation
Ordinance No. 035,
[27]
 which fixed the municipal budget
for calendar year 1991, was passed only on May 21, 1990, or almost another year
after the transfer took effect.  The
petitionerâs failure to approve the complainantâs vouchers was therefore due to
some legal obstacles,
[28]
 and not entirely without reason.  Thus, evident bad faith cannot be completely
imputed to him.


âBad faith does
not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose
or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty
through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.
(Spiegel v. Beacon Participations, 8 NE 2
nd
 Series, 895, 1007).  It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive
design or some motive of self interest or ill will for ulterior purposes (Air
France v. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155, 166-167).  Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of
the accused to do wrong or cause damage.â
 
[29]


In 
Jacinto, 
evident
bad faith was not appreciated because the actions taken by the accused were not
entirely without rhyme or reason; he refused to release the complainantâs
salary because the latter failed to submit her daily time record; he refused to
approve her sick-leave application because he found out that she did not suffer
any illness; and he removed her name from the plantilla because she was
moonlighting during office hours.  Such
actions were measures taken by a superior against an erring employee who
studiously ignored, if not defied, his authority.
[30]


In 
Alejandro,

evident bad faith was ruled out, because the accused gave his approval to
the questioned disbursement after relying on the certification of the
bookkeeper on  the availability of funds
for such disbursement.
[31]


Third Issue:  
Interpretation
of 
Causing


The Court does
not completely agree with petitionerâs assertion that the imputed act does not
fall under Sec. 3[e] which, according to him, requires a positive act -- a
malfeasance or misfeasance.  
Causing 
means
âto be the cause or occasion of, to effect as an agent, to bring into
existence, to make or to induce, to compel.â
[32]
 
Causing
 is, therefore, not
limited to positive acts only.  Even
passive acts or inaction may cause undue injury.  What is essential is that undue injury, which is quantifiable and
demonstrable, results from the questioned official act or inaction.


In this case,
the prosecution accused petitioner of failing or refusing to pay complainantâs
salaries on time, while Respondent Court convicted him of unduly delaying the
payment of complainantâs claims.   As
already explained, both acts did not, however, legally result in âundue injuryâ
or in âgiving any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the
discharge of his official, [or] administrative x x x functions.â  Thus, these acts are not punishable under
Sec. 3[e].


It would appear
that petitionerâs failure or refusal to act on the complainantâs vouchers, or
the delay in his acting on them more properly falls under Sec. 3[f]:


â(f)
    
Neglecting or refusing, after due demand or request, without
sufficient justification, to act within a reasonable time on any matter pending
before him for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any
person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or
advantage, or for purpose of favoring his own interest or giving undue
advantage in favor of or discriminating against any other interested party.â


Here, the
neglect or refusal to act within a reasonable time is the criminal act, not the
causing of undue injury.  Thus, its
elements are:


â1)
    
The offender is a public officer;


2)
     
Said officer has neglected or has refused to act without
sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him;


3)
     
Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the
public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; and


4)
     
Such failure to so act is âfor the purpose
of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter
some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested
party, or discriminating against another.â
[33]


However, petitioner is not charged with a violation of Sec. 3[f].  Hence, further disquisition is not
proper.  Neither may this Court convict
petitioner under Sec. 3[f] without violating his constitutional right to due
process.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby
GRANTED.  Petitioner is ACQUITTED of
violating Section 3[e] of R.A. 3019, as amended.  No costs.
