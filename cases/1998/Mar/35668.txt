ROMERO, J.:


Before this
Court are the following motions: (a) [First] Motion
[1]
 dated November 29, 1997, filed by
petitioners heirs of Pedro Escanlar and Francisco Holgado; (b) Motion for Leave
to File Second Motion for Partial Reconsideration and Clarification
[2]
 dated February 9, 1998; and (c)
Second Motion for Partial Reconsideration and Clarification
[3]
 of even date, the latter two
motions having been filed by petitioners Edwin and Elisa Jayme (the
âJaymesâ).  These motions all pertain to
this Courtâs decision
[4]
 promulgated on October 23, 1997,
the decretal portion of which states:


â
WHEREFORE
, the petitions
are hereby 
GRANTED
. The decision of the Court of Appeals under review is
hereby 
REVERSED AND SET ASIDE
.  The case is 
REMANDED
 to the Regional Trial Court of Negros
Occidental, Branch 61 for petitioners and private respondents Cari-an or their
successors-in-interest to determine exactly which 1/2 portion of Lot Nos. 1616
and 1617 will be owned by each party, at the option of petitioners.  The trial court is 
DIRECTED 
to order
the issuance of the corresponding certificates of title in the name of the
respective parties and to resolve the matter of rental payments of the land not
delivered to the Chua spouses subject to the rates specified above with legal
interest from date of demand.â


wherein we ruled, 
inter alia
, that the first sale to petitioners
Francisco Holgado and the late Pedro Escanlar by the Cari-an heirs (the
âCari-ansâ) of the one-half portions of Lots 1616 and 1617 pertaining to the
share in the conjugal estate of their predecessor Victoriana Cari-an was valid
while the subsequent conveyance of the same to respondents Paquito Chua and Ney
Sarrosa-Chua (the âChuasâ) was not.


In particular,
petitioners are seeking clarification of that part of the decision which
states:


â5.
           
Recapitulating,
we have held that the September 15, 1978 deed of sale of rights, interests and
participations is valid and that the sellers-private respondents Cari-an were
fully paid the contract price. However,  it must be emphasized that what was sold was only the Cari-anâs
hereditary shares in Lot Nos. 1616 and 1617 being held 
pro indiviso
 by
them and is thus a valid conveyance only of said ideal shares.  Specific or designated portions of land were
not involved.


Consequently, the subsequent sale
of 8 parcels of land, including Lot Nos. 1616 and 1617, to the spouses Chua is
valid except to the extent of what was sold to petitioners in the September 15,
1978 conveyance.  It must be noted,
however, that the probate court in Special Proceeding No. 7-7279 desisted from
awarding the individual shares of each heir because all the properties
belonging to the estate had already been sold. Thus it is not certain how much
private respondents Cari-an were entitled to with respect to the two lots, or if
they were even going to be awarded shares in said lots.


The proceedings surrounding the
estate of Nombre and Cari-an having  attained finality for nearly a decade now, the same cannot be
re-opened.  The protracted proceedings
which have undoubtedly left the property under a cloud and the parties involved
in a state of uncertainty compels us to resolve it definitively.


The decision of the probate court
declares private respondents Cari-an as the sole heirs by representation of
Victoriana Cari-an who was indisputably entitled to half of the estate.  There being no exact apportionment of the
shares of each heir and no competent proof that the heirs received unequal
shares in the disposition of the estate, it can be assumed that the heirs of
Victoriana Cari-an collectively are entitled to half of each property in the
estate. More particularly, private respondents Cari-an are entitled to half of
Lot Nos. 1616 and 1617, i.e. 14, 675 square meters of Lot No. 1616 and 230,474
square meters of Lot No. 1617. 
Consequently, petitioners, as their
successors-in-interest, own said half of the subject lots and ought to deliver
the possession of the other half, as well as pay rents thereon, to the private
respondents Ney Sarrosa Chua and Paquito Chua but only if the former (petitioners)
remained in possession thereof.


The rate of rental payments to
be made were given in evidence by Ney Sarrosa Chua in her unrebutted testimony
on July 24, 1989
:  
For the fishpond (Lot No. 1617) - From 1982 up to 1986,
rental payment of 
P
3,000.00 per hectare; from 1986-1989
(and succeeding years), rental payment of 
P
10,000.00 per hectare.  For the riceland (Lot No. 1616) - 15 cavans per hectare per year; from
1982-1986, P125.00 per cavan; 1987-1988, 
P
175.00 per cavan; and 1989 and succeeding years, 
P
200.00 per cavan
. (Underscoring supplied).


Petitioners
would have this Court take a second look at its supposed automatic award to the
Chuas of the other halves representing the late Guillermo Nombreâs shares in Lot
Nos. 1616 and 1617 on the grounds that: (a) these other halves have never been
the subject of the present litigation or the double sale complained of by
petitioners; and (b) there are certain undivided interests in these other
halves which have been conveyed by some Nombre heirs to Escanlar who in turn
sold the same to the Jaymes.  In other
words, the Jaymes, according to petitioners, are actually entitled to the
one-half portions of Lot Nos. 1616 and 1617 previously sold by the Cari-ans to
Escanlar and Holgado and the validity of which have been upheld by this Court 
plus

certain portions of the other halves of the same lots sold this time by some
Nombre heirs to Escanlar.  For these
reasons, petitioners argue that there is no basis at all in fact and in law for
the Court to award the entire one-half portions of the said lots to the Chuas,
as well as to charge the Jaymes rental payments thereon.


Upon closer
scrutiny and re-examination  of the
records, the Court is convinced that there is merit in the above
contentions.  It is a fact that the
other ideal one-half shares of the late Guillermo Nombre in Lot Nos. 1616 and
1617 have never been entirely sold to the Chuas because some of the Nombre
heirs who are composed of the descendants of Guillermo Nombreâs brothers and
sisters
[5]
 likewise sold their undivided
shares to Escanlar who in turn conveyed them to the Jaymes. All these
transactions are duly evidenced by several deeds of sale
[6]
 and a Memorandum of Agreement
[7]
 dated August 31, 1984, whose
validity and authenticity have not been impugned by any party.  As a matter of fact, there were also some
shares which were not conveyed at all to either Chuas or Jaymes.  In any event, these sales by the Nombre
heirs to Escanlar whose interests were eventually acquired by the Jaymes had
the effect of increasing the latterâs ownership beyond the one-half portions of
the subject lots originally sold by the Cari-ans. Correspondingly, the Chuas
are entitled only to those portions as have been conveyed to them which
actually amount to less than the one-half participation of Guillermo Nombre in
each of said lots.  More particularly,
these are the ideal shares which they have acquired from Lazaro Nombre,
Victorio Madalag, Domingo Campillanos, and Sofronio Campillanos by virtue of the
September 21, 1982 deed of sale, as well as from Felicidad Nombre, Potencia
Brillas, and Enrique Campillanos, through instruments other than said deed.


In view of the
foregoing findings, it necessarily follows that there is no justification for
the Jaymes to be compelled to turn over one-half of Lot No. 1616 and one-half
of Lot No. 1617, and be held liable to pay the Chuas rentals with respect to
those portions. On the contrary, we find it equitable instead to hold the Chuas
answerable for reasonable rentals to the extent of their possession of portions
of Lot Nos. 1616 and 1617 which now properly belong to the Jaymes by virtue of
the above findings.


ACCORDINGLY
, the Court hereby resolves to

GRANT
 the above motions of petitioners heirs of Pedro Escanlar and
Francisco Holgado, as well as that of the spouses Edwin A. Jayme and Elisa T.
Jayme. The decision of this Court dated October 23, 1997, insofar as it awarded
one-half of Lot No. 1616 and one-half of Lot No. 1617 to the spouses Paquito
and Ney Sarrosa-Chua, and which made the spouses Jayme liable for rental
payments thereon, is VACATED and SET ASIDE. In lieu thereof, a new one is
entered to read as follows:


â
WHEREFORE
, the petitions
are hereby 
GRANTED
. The decision of the Court of Appeals under review is
hereby 
REVERSED AND SET ASIDE
.  The case is 
REMANDED 
to the Regional Trial Court of Negros
Occidental, Branch 61, for petitioners and private respondents or their
successors-in-interest to determine exactly the portions which will be owned by
each party in accordance with the foregoing resolution, at the option of
petitioners. The trial court is likewise 
DIRECTED
 to order the issuance
of the corresponding certificates of title in the name of the respective
parties and to determine how much rentals the Chuas have to pay the Jaymes from
the time the former possessed, if they did at all, the portions pertaining to
the latter up to the time the same are restored.â
