On 15 October
1990  Wage Order No. NCR-01, which
increased by 
P
17.00 a day the minimum wage of private sector workers and
employees in the National Capital Region receiving a basic wage of  not more than 
P
125.00 per day, with
certain exceptions,
[2]
 was promulgated by the Regional
Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board.
[3]
â


Subsequently, or
on 20 December 1990, the NCR Regional  Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board, in view of the continuing
economic crisis brought about by the Gulf war and the natural calamities that
befell the country, promulgated Wage Order  No. NCR-02 granting another provisional wage increase of  
P
12.00 per day to employees receiving
a daily wage of 
P
142.00 mentioned in the immediately preceding
paragraph.
[4]
â


As a consequence
of  Wage Orders Nos. NCR-01 and NCR-02,
the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) issued DECS Order No. 30,
Series of 1991, setting the guidelines for tuition fee increase which would
answer for wage increases, relevant provisions of which read -


1.  In response to the clamor from the regions for guidelines  responsive to the  needs  and conditions  peculiar  to these  areas  and  in consideration  of  the regional  wage  orders, schools  may  increase their tuition  fees  as provided by the State Assistance Council
(SAC) in accordance with the following guidelines -


a)  
Entering  Freshman
.
- The tuition fee rates for entering freshman in all levels  may  be determined  by  the  school  itself subject to
consultation.  However, no consultation
is required when the amount  of increase
will  raise the tuition fee level to not
more than 
P
80.00 per unit  for
the tertiary schools and to not more than 
P
1,500.00 per year for  the elementary and secondary schools.


b) 
Upper Year Students
. -
Schools may increase their tuition fees for the upper year students in
accordance with the following prescribed rates: x x x x  


Tuition  fee  increase within the
prescribed rates  above  shall  not require  consultation  and  DECS approval provided that a notice  of increase  is submitted to  the DECS regional office not later than
April 30, 1991.  Schools may increase
up to a maximum  level rate  of  25% for program  below Level II
accreditation and up to a maximum  of  30%  for programs with Level II and Level III accreditation based
on  approved tuition fee rates in
school year 1990-1991, subject to consultation:  x x x x


c)  
Emergency  Tuition  Fee Assessment
.  -  To  comply  with  the provisional emergency cost of living allowances mandated by the  Regional Tripartite  Wages  and  Productivity Boards of
Regions VI, VII, VIII,  IX, X, XI, XII
and NCR, schools in these regions  may  collect  an  emergency tuition fee assessment from both the entering freshman and the
upper year students in all levels in accordance with the following
schedule:  x x x x


The above prescribed emergency
tuition  fee  assessments  shall  be collected only in school year  1991- 1992 and shall not form part of  the approved tuition fee rates.  Consultation and DECS approval shall not  be required.  However, a  notice of
collection shall be submitted  to the  DECS not later than  April  30, 1991.
[5]


On the basis
thereof, private respondents sent DECS a letter dated 15 April 1991 notifying
that office of the 
P
226.50 increase in tuition fee for all grade levels
and another  
P
226.50  emergency tuition fee increase to comply
with the Emergency Tuition Fee Allowance (ETFA).
[6]
 All in all, ASI collected for
school year 1991-1992 the amount of 
P
763,021.88 as increase in the
prescribed tuition fee for NCR and another 
P
763,021.88 for the ETFA or a
total of 
P
1,526,043.76.
[7]


Petitioner
thereafter made several representations with private respondents for the proper
distribution of the 70% share from the tuition fee increase pursuant  to  Sec. 5,  par. 2,  RA No. 6728, which reads - 


2)  Assistance  under  paragraph  (1),  subparagraphs (a) and
(b),  shall be granted and tuition fees
under subparagraph (c) may be increased on the condition  that  seventy percent (70%) of  the  amount  subsidized allotted for tuition fee increases shall go to the payment of
salaries, wages, allowances and other  benefits of teaching and non-teaching personnel except administrators
who are principal  stockholders of the
school and may be used to cover increases as provided for in the collective
bargaining agreements existing or in force  at the time when this  Act  is approved and made effective:  x x x x


According to
petitioner, complementing the aforecited provision is a stipulation in Sec. 3,
Art. X, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in force which states that - 


Any tuition fee increase applied
for and approved by the DECS during the  term  of this agreement shall be
treated in  accordance with DECS
memorandum/circular in effect at the time of the increase provided that the
portion allotted for  salary increase
and other benefits shall be distributed in the ratio  of 75:25.
[8]


In effect,
petitioner is asking for 
P
534,115.32 or 70% of 
P
763,021.88
collected pursuant to the prescribed tuition fee increase.  


Private
respondents, in a letter to petitioner dated 12 February  1993,  presented their computation regarding the distribution of the tuition
fee increase as follows:  
P
534,115.32
(which is 70% of 
P
763,021.88, the prescribed tuition fee increase) plus 
P
763,021.88
(which is the money collected pursuant to ETFA) equals 
P
1,306,137.20
(which is the amount the employees are entitled to after increasing their
salaries).  When they granted the gross
salary increase of 
P
1,545,777.15 to the faculty and non-teaching
personnel, the amount constituted more than 70% of the total of the tuition fee
increase and the ETFA, hence, they have fully complied with RA No. 6728.
[9]
 In arriving at the amount of  
P
1,545,777.15  private respondents included the following
items in their computation:  


  Retroactive payment of 
P
12.00/day 


  provisional increase effective 


  January  1991 to
April 1991
         
 
P
254,880.00


 
P
12.00/day provisional 


  increase for May 1991 to 


  April 1992 (SY 1991-92)
     
  828,360.00


  Total provisional increase    
P
1,083,240.00


  Add:  SSS/PERAA/MEDICARE  
108,324.00


  Total payments on provisional increase


  of 
P
12.00/day
        
 
P
1,191,564.00


  Other salary increases:


  CBA Adj. (
P
75.00 per emp)
         
 
P
189,832.50



  Re-ranking
                       
  102,384.00


  Change in Pay class
                  
  29,250.00


  Add:  SSS/PERAA/MEDICARE  
32,146.65


 
                         
 
    
 
353,613.15


  Total payments for the 70% 


  share at 
P
12.00/day plus  other 


  salary increases  and


  salary related benefits  
P
1,545,177.15


Petitioner
objected and maintained that the mandated salary increases per approved wage
orders should not be credited against the collected tuition fee increase.  The employees should receive instead 
P
534,115.32
which is 70% of 
P
763,021.88, the prescribed tuition fee increase.  Respondents on the other hand claimed that
DECS Order No. 30, Series of 1991, had in effect authorized the tuition fee
increase to help the school to mitigate the effects of the increase in the wage
salaries as mandated by the approved wage orders.  


In the resulting
impasse,
 
petitioner filed a complaint with the Labor Arbiter for money
claims and unfair labor practice.


Private
respondents argue before the Labor Arbiter that the above-mentioned Sec. 5,
par. 2, RA No. 6728, and Sec. 3, Art. X, of the CBA provision find no
application in their case as they properly pertain to a tuition  fee  increase applied for and approved by the DECS.  In  contrast, the subject
tuition fee increase was not applied for nor did it require consultation or
DECS approval but merely a notice of increase  which  had to be submitted
to  the  DECS  regional office not later
than 30 April 1991.
[10]


Private
respondents further  argued that
the  proper  and  applicable provision
in the existing CBA was Sec. 4, Art. X, which provides -


Any government mandated salary as
wage increase  approved  during the life of this agreement shall be
implemented per its implementing rules/guidelines.
[11]


In his decision
dated 9 December 1993,
[12]
 the Labor Arbiter found that
respondent school should pay petitioner AFEA 70% of the tuition fee increase of

P
763,021.88 amounting to 
P
530,410.53 plus attorney's fees of 
P
53,410.53
considering the rationale behind the issuance of DECS Order No. 30, Series of
1991 - 


x x x  it can be safely said that the authority to effect tuition fee
increases was granted to ease the problems of the employees brought about by
Wage Orders 1 and 2 and certainly not to hold them to satisfy contractual
obligations such as wage increases stipulated in a CBA.  


The Labor
Arbiter further observed that RA No. 6728 was worded explicitly.  Seventy percent (70%) of the tuition fee
increase was to be distributed mandatorily to both the teaching and
non-teaching personnel of the school.  In the absence of any express provision allowing the school to
appropriate the collected  tuition fee
increase  for some other purpose, the
clear mandate of the law to distribute the 70% increase must prevail.  To rule otherwise, the Labor Arbiter opined,
would run counter  to the intent of DECS
Order No. 30 or RA No. 6728.  


On  appeal, ASI reiterated its position that it
had fully complied with RA No. 6728 and NLRC agreed.  However NLRC qualified its conformity by modifying the
dispositive portion of the decision of the Labor Arbiter.  It credited the salary increase  given
 
to  the  faculty  and non-teaching  personnel  of  respondent  school  but  excluded  the increase of 
P
353,613.15 mandated by the CBA adjustment,
re-ranking, change in pay class and SSS/PERAA/MEDICARE, and credited the amount
of 
P
1,191,564.00 representing the total provisional increase to the
amount of 
P
1,306,137.20 due the personnel,  thus arriving at the amount of  
P
114,573.20. 


Contrary to the
ruling of the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC found that  DECS Order No. 30, Series of 1991,  "spells out the grant of authority for schools to increase
their tuition fee rates as anchored, among others, on the consideration of the
regional wage orders  x x x x  To this extent, crediting the wage increase
to the seventy percent (70%) of the employees in  the tuition fees collected is proper."  Consequently, the NLRC reduced the amount
of salary differentials due petitioner to only 
P
114,573.20 so that the
award of attorney's fees representing the 10% of the decreed amount was
accordingly reduced to 
P
11,457.32.
[13]


Petitioner now
imputes error to respondent NLRC in crediting the provisional wage increase
under Wage Order No. NCR-02 against the seventy percent (70%) portion of the
tuition fee increase in violation of the collective bargaining agreement and
DECS Order No. 30, Series of 1991.


Petitioner
maintains that the tuition fee increase is not and has never been intended to
cover the cost of provisional wage increase which was supposed to be borne by
the ETFA.  Rather, per their CBA,  the tuition fee increase was to be used for
salaries and benefits of the covered employees in the ratio  of  75:25.  With  insistence,  it  pointed out that ASI made two
(2) collections, i.e., one for the tuition fee increase, and the other,  for  the  ETFA.


We  disagree with petitioner.  As found by the NLRC, the text of DECS
Order No. 30, Series of 1991, in consideration of the regional wage orders,
shows the grant of authority for schools to increase their tuition fee rates
necessary to mitigate the effects  of
the wage increase in learning institutions.  As aptly observed by the NLRC, Sec. 6 of the Rules Implementing Wage
Orders Nos. NCR-01 and NCR-01-A
[14]
 provides that the share of the
workers and employees in the increase in  the tuition fee for the school  year  1990 shall be credited in
compliance with the prescribed wage increase.  Definitely, this provision is nowhere to be  found  in  Wage Order No. NCR-02.  


Schools were
thus prohibited from crediting whatever wage  increases were received by their employees on account of the tuition fee
increase that may have been effected for schoolyear 1991, hence, the authority
to effect an increase in tuition fees in order to cover the  emergency  wage increase subject matter of Wage Order No. NCR-02. Therefore,
crediting the wage increase to the seventy percent (70%) share of  the employees in the tuition  fees  thus collected is proper. 


Further,  the NLRC properly ordered that the increases
given by  respondents by virtue of the
CBA, re-ranking, change in pay class and SSS/PERAA/MEDICARE  be stricken out from the computation.


However, a
correction must still be made with regard to the computation.  The total amount due the employees is 
P
1,297,137.20
(not 
P
1,306,137.20) which is the sum of 
P
763,021.88 collected by
virtue of the ETFA, and 
P
534,115.32, which is 70% of 
P
763,021.88
or the collection on the prescribed tuition fee increase.  Subtracting 
P
1,191,564.00 (the  amount given to the employees minus the increase
under the CBA and the other benefits granted them) from
 
P
1,297,132.20
(the corrected total amount due the employees) leaves us a difference of 
P
105,573.20,
the amount due the employees after finally determining the 70% of the
prescribed tuition fee increase and the ETFA.  The attorney's fees  equivalent  to  10%  of  the modified award of 
P
105,573.20
is accordingly reduced to 
P
10,557.32.  


WHEREFORE
,  the instant petition is 
DENIED
.  The assailed  Decision of 18
January 1995  and  the Resolution of 12 May 1995 are  AFFIRMED  with the following modifications:  the amount of salary differentials due petitioner Angelicum Faculty and
Employees Association (AFEA) is One Hundred and Five Thousand Five Hundred
Seventy-Three Pesos and Twenty Centavos  (
P
105,573.20) instead of One Hundred Fourteen Thousand Five
Hundred Seventy-Three and Twenty Centavos (
P
114,573.20), and the award
of attorney's fees representing 10% thereof is accordingly reduced to Ten
Thousand Five Hundred and Fifty-Seven Pesos and Thirty-Two Centavos (
P
10,557.32)
instead of Eleven Thousand Four Hundred Fifty-Seven Pesos and Thirty-Two  Centavos (
P
11,457.32).
