GOVERNMENTÂ  SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (GSIS), PETITIONER,
VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, (THIRTEENTH DIVISION),Â  JOSE SALONGA, TAN KIAT TIAN AND JOSEFINA USMAN JOINED BY HER
HUSBAND ESTEBAN TAN, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


This is a
petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No.
44058 entitled âJose Salonga, et al 
v
. Queenâs Row Subdivision Inc,
Government Service Insurance System, et al.â
[1]
 dated February 27, 1997, involving
an action for declaration of ownership and cancellation of title.


Private
respondents Jose Salonga, Tan Kiat Tan, and Josefina Usman were registered
co-owners pro-
indiviso
 of two parcels of land located at Molino, Bacoor,
Cavite with Transfer Certificate of Titles Nos. T-32452 and T-32453 issued by
the Register of Deeds of Cavite on November 5, 1968.
[2]
 The property was  collectively conveyed to them by Emiliano
Bunag and Raymundo Catienza by virtue of a Deed of Sale dated October 31, 1968.


Sometime in
1974, the Municipal Treasurer of Cavite refused private respondentsâ payment
for real estate taxes of the property on the ground that the tax declarations
of the property were already cancelled.  Upon investigation, they discovered that  new tax declarations and titles of the said property were issued
in the name of Queenâs Row Subdivision, Inc. (QRSI).  TCT No. T-32453 was superseded  by  TCT No.  T-54244,  issued  on August 27, 1971, while
TCT No.  T-32452 was now covered by TCT
No. T-54192, issued on August 17, 1971, both in the name of QRSI.
[3]


On June 17,
1974, private respondents sent a letter-complaint to the Public Assistance
Office (PAO) of the then Ministry of National Defense seeking assistance and
asking for an immediate investigation of QRSI and the Register of Deeds of
Cavite.
[4]
 No action was, however, taken by
the PAO.


On November 13,
1987, private respondents filed an action for declaration of ownership and
cancellation of title against QRSI, the Register of Deeds of Cavite, and the
Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) under  Civil Case No. BCV-87-36 before the Regional Trial Court of
Bacoor, Cavite, Branch 19.


The GSIS was
impleaded in the action since records show that it entered into a project and
loan agreement  with QRSI wherein the
former granted the latter a loan in the amount of 
P
14,360,000.00 secured
by a real estate mortgage covering QRSIâs properties in Molino, Bacoor, Cavite
totalling an area of 1,300,000 square meters. Among the properties included as
collateral were private respondentsâ two lots.  Upon QRSIâs default in payment, the properties were extrajudicially
foreclosed by the GSIS. 


For failure to
file an  Answer within the reglementary
period, QRSI and the Register of Deeds of Cavite were both declared in
default.  The GSIS, on the other hand,
filed an Answer, and trial on the merits was conducted.


On July 21,
1992, the trial court rendered a decision
[5]
 in favor of private respondents,
the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, this Court finds for
the plaintiffs and against the defendant Queenâs Row Subdivision, Inc., the
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Register of Deeds of Cavite
who are hereby ordered to:


1.
      
maintain, revive, and/or
reinstate TCT No. T-32452 and TCT No. T-32453 in the names of plaintiffs Tan
Kiat Tan, Josefina Usman and Jose Salonga who are hereby declared owners in fee
simple of the same;


2.
      
cancel TCT Nos. T-54192 and
T-54244 in so far as they affect TCT Nos. T-32452 and T-32453 of plaintiffs
from being procured by fraud (Bruce vs Apurado, 26 Phil 838) and for being
issued for land already covered by prior Torrens title;


3.
      
the Municipal Treasurer of
Bacoor, Cavite to reinstate tax declaration nos. 11715 and 11716 of the said
Municipal Treasurerâs Office in the name of plaintiffs;


4.
      
pay attorneyâs fees of
P/40,000.00 and P/50,000.00 as cost of suit to the plaintiffs.


SO ORDERED.â


The GSIS then
appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals, alleging that the trial court
erred in its findings. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition and affirmed
the decision of the trial court 
in toto
.
[6]
 Hence, this petition, where
petitioner raises the following issues:  (a) the Court of Appeals erred in not ruling that petitioner GSIS was a
mortgagee and purchaser in good faith; (b) that private respondentsâ cause of
action has already prescribed; and (c) the Court of Appeals erred in affirming
the award of  attorneyâs fees by the
trial court.
[7]


The petition
must fail.


The GSIS claims
that it has a better right over the property as a mortgagee and subsequent
purchaser for value in good faith.  It
argues that it had the right to rely on the face of the certificates of title
(T-54192 and T-54244) and  it was justified
in dispensing with the need for inquiring further since it had no actual knowledge
of facts or circumstances that would compel them to make an inquiry.  Moreover, it had complied with all the
requirements of a valid extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage and acquired the
subject properties as highest bidder free from any lien and encumbrance and
without any defect.  The GSIS maintains
that it should be considered a mortgagee and subsequent purchaser for value in
good faith, with a superior right to the property. 


These arguments
are not persuasive enough.


The GSIS was
created for the purpose of providing social security and insurance benefits as
well as promoting efficiency and the welfare of government employees.
[8]


Under the
Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997:
[9]


âSec. 36.  Investment of Funds. - The funds of the GSIS
which are not needed to meet the current obligations may be invested under such
terms and conditions and rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the
Board: Provided, that investments shall satisfy the requirements of liquidity,
safety, security and yield in order to ensure the actuarial solvency of the
funds of the GSIS; x x xâ
[10]


It should be
emphasized that the funds of the GSIS come from the monthly contributions of
its members. Thus, its business is to keep in trust money belonging to its
members, the government employees.


The GSIS Act
grants the GSIS the power to invest its funds, directly or indirectly.
[11]
 Being allowed to engage in
financing, the GSIS should, therefore, exercise care and prudence in investing its
funds, such as in granting loans. Although the GSIS is categorized as a social
security and insurance entity, its ancilliary function of investing funds
imposes upon it the duty of exercising due diligence in dealing with properties
submitted as collateral for loans.


In the case of 
Tomas
v. Tomas
,
[12]
 we had occasion to rule: 


âx x x.  Banks, indeed, should exercise more care and prudence in dealing
even with registered lands, than private individuals, for their business is one
affected with public interest, keeping in trust  money belonging to their depositors, which they should guard
against loss by not committing any act of negligence which amount to lack of
good faith by which they would be denied the protective mantle of the land
registration statute, Act 496, extended only to purchasers for value and good
faith, as well as to mortgagees of the same character and description.â


This doctrine
can well be applied to the instant case.  The records show that QRSI mortgaged properties located at Molino,
Bacoor, Cavite covering an area of 1,300,000 square meters for the construction
of 4,493 housing units therein to the GSIS in consideration of the
P14,360,000.00 loan granted to it. Private respondentsâ properties were among
those included in the mortgage. QRSI somehow managed to illegally procure its
own certificates of title covering private respondentsâ lots. 


The same
records, however, fail to reveal that the GSIS exercised due diligence in
ascertaining the real owners of TCT Nos. 54192 and 54244.  If the GSIS had investigated the same,  then it would have learned that said TCTs
were illegally obtained. Moreover, it should have been more cautious, considering
the substantial amount of the loan granted. Thus, the GSIS cannot assert the
defense of good faith, considering that it did not exercise the proper
diligence required by the situation.


In 
Rural Bank
of Compostela v. Court of Appeals, et al
.,
[13]
 this Court held that if a bank
failed to observe due diligence , it is not considered a mortgagee in good
faith, thus:


âx x x. Secondly, the rule that
persons dealing with registered lands can rely solely on the certificate of
title does not apply to banks: 


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx


There is no proof at all that the
petitioner observed due diligence in ascertaining who the occupants or owners
of the property were, considering that Free Patent No. (VII-I) 939 and OCT No.
0-10288 were just recently issued.


      
xxx
                              
xxx
                              
xxx.


All told, the petitioner was not a
mortgagee in good faith.â


Petitioner is
deemed to have failed to exercise the requisite due diligence in ascertaining
if the land mortgaged to it by QRSI covered by TCT Nos. 54192 and 54244 was
valid and free from any legal defect.  This failure is tantamount to negligence for petitioner cannot simply
rely on the face of the title of the property, as its  ancilliary  function of
investing funds requires a greater degree of diligence. It cannot, therefore,
be considered as a mortgagee and subsequent purchaser in good faith, and
necessarily, private respondents are deemed to have a better right over the
property.


The contention
of petitioner that the cause of action of private respondents has prescribed in
the case at bar cannot, likewise, be given consideration.  Laches is defined as the failure or neglect,
for an unreasonable length of time, to do that which by exercising due
diligence, could or should have done earlier. The negligence or omission to
assert a right within a reasonable time, warrants a presumption that the party
entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.
[14]


In this case,
the records show that  when private
respondents discovered that the tax declaration of their property was
cancelled,  they forthwith filed a
complaint with the Public Assistance Office of the then Ministry of National
Defense seeking an immediate investigation on the matter.  When no action  was taken by the latter, they then filed a complaint for
declaration of ownership and cancellation of title against QRSI, the Registry
of Deeds of Cavite and petitioner.


For laches to
exist, there should be a showing of delay in asserting the complainantâs
(herein private respondentsâ) right.
[15]
 Based on the foregoing, it cannot
be said that private respondents slept on their rights, inasmuch as from the
time they discovered the cancellation of the tax declarations, they immediately
filed a complaint to assert their ownership over the property.


As regards the
propriety of the monetary award, the appellate court correctly ruled that the
trial court was justified in awarding the same since the attorneyâs fee of 
P
40,000.00
and litigation cost of 
P
50,000.00 were duly proven  by private respondents.


The assessment
and evaluation for the award of attorneyâs fees and litigation cost are
findings of fact ordinarily left to the trial court for its conclusive
determination.


Finally, it is a
fundamental and settled rule that factual findings of the trial court, adopted
and confirmed by the Court of Appeals, are final and conclusive and may not be
reviewed on appeal. This Court finds no justifiable reason or exception
[16]
 to this rule sufficient to cause a
reversal of the judgments rendered by both the trial and appellate courts.  


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is hereby
DENIED.  The decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 44058 dated February 27, 1997, is AFFIRMED 
in toto
.  No costs.

 The exceptions to the rule are: (1)when the
inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (2) when there is

speculations, surmises or conjectures; (4) when the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are
conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals, in making its findings went beyond
the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of the
appellant and appellee; (7) when the findings of the Court of Appeals are
contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of facts are
conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9)
when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not
disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a
different conclusion; and (10) when the findings of fact of the Court of
Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the
evidence on record.  Reyes v. Court of Appeals
