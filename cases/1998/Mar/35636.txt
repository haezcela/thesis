MENDOZA, J.:


For
consideration are (1) petitioner's Omnibus Motion in G.R. No. 112991 seeking
reconsideration of the Court's resolution dated October 9, 1995, which denied
the reconsideration of the decision in this case promulgated on March 20, 1995,
and the resolution of October 13, 1995 which absolved the branch clerk of court
of the RTC of Manila, Branch 31, of charges of wrongdoing; and (2) the
manifestation and motions for clarification filed by the Land Bank of the
Philippines (LBP) concerning the request of petitioner in G.R. No. 112991 for
the transfer of the funds of the Pacific Banking Corporation (PaBC) to its other
account in another branch of LBP and the alleged garnishment of the funds of
PaBC deposited in LBP in favor of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.


The
antecedent facts are as follows:


On March 20, 1995, the Court
rendered a decision holding that a petition for liquidation under Sec. 29 of
the Central Bank Act, R.A.No. 265
[1]
 is a special proceeding and , therefore, the rules
prescribing a period of 30 days for appealing and requiring a record on appeal
apply.  Accordingly, the appeal in G.R.
No. 109373 was held to have been duly perfected but the appeal in G.R. No.
112991 had not been perfected because of petitioner's failure to file a record
on appeal.


Petitioner in G.R. No. 112991 moved
for a reconsideration of the aforesaid decision but the Court denied his motion
in its resolution of October 9, 1995 on the following grounds (1) the clerks of
the RTC and the Court of Appeals certified that no record on appeal had been
filed; (2) the branch clerk denied that the signature on the alleged copy of
the record on appeal was his; (3) counsel for private respondents and his clerk
denied in their respective affidavits that they had been served a copy of the
record on appeal; (4) the identity of the person who allegedly received the
record on appeal filed in the trial court and whose initials appear on the
first page of the alleged copy of the said record had never been established;
and (5) the copy of the record on appeal allegedly filed did not bear the stamp
of the RTC showing due receipt thereof.


In the resolution of October 13,
1995, the Court held Judge Regino Veridiano II, Deputy Sheriff Carmelo Cachero
and private respondent's counsel, Atty. Marino Eslao, guilty of indirect
contempt for executing the decision of the trial court despite the temporary
restraining order issued by this Court.  The Court, however, found no basis of holding branch clerk Antonio Valencia
Jr. guilty of any wrongdoing in certifying that petitioner failed to file a
record on appeal.


On November 6, 1995, petitioner
then filed the Omnibus Motion in question seeking to (1) reopen the case and/or
consider the resolution of October 9, 1995 which denied his motion for
reconsideration, and (2) reconsider the October 13, 1995 resolution absolving
the branch clerk of the trial court from contempt charges.


In his omnibus motion, petitioner
insists that he filed a record on appeal.  As proof, he presents a photocopy of the record on appeal allegedly
received by the branch clerk of the trial court bearing the handwritten
notation "Received, 10-15-92, 3:45 PM" and the alleged initials of
the said clerk.  Petitioner explains
that the record on appeal does not have the RTC stamp "Received" because
the trial court does not use a stamp but receipt of pleadings is acknowledged
simply by nothing this fact by hand.  Petitioner submitted certain pleadings filed  in the trial court which were acknowledged by the branch clerk in
the same way he allegedly acknowledged by the branch clerk in the same way he
allegedly acknowledged receipt of petitioner's record on appeal.  These are the notice of appeal filed by
petitioner on October 14, 1992 (Annex E, Omnibus Motion), Motion to Strike Out
the Notice of Appeal with Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution filed by the
private respondents (Annex G) and Comment filed by another claimant (Solid
Bank) dated May 26, 1995 (Annex H).


In addition, petitioner claims that
the certifications by the clerks of the RTC and the Court of Appeals that no
record on appeal was filed are unreliable, that his record on appeal was
suppressed from the records of the case, and that the certification of the
Court of Appeals that no record on appeal was filed therein was to be expected
because the record on appeal was filed with the RTC and not with the Court of
Appeals.


Commenting, private respondents
contend that the Omnibus Motion is actually a second motion for reconsideration
which is not allowed by the rules since the issues raised therein had been
fully considered and passed upon by the Court and that there is no compelling
reason to grant the motion.  They
maintain that petitioner's appeal was not perfected because of the non-filing
of a record on appeal.  Branch Clerk of
court Antonio Valencia, on the other hand, maintains that "no record on
appeal was filed and therefore none could be found in the expediente (records
of the case)."  He claims that the
record on appeal allegedly filed in the trial court could not have been unlawfully
removed from the records because all pleadings received by the court are
immediately attached to the records.  He
denies that the signature appearing on the alleged record on appeal was his.


Because of the serious ness of the
petitioner's allegation that its record on appeal had been suppressed, the
Court on December 11, 1996, referred the question to the Office of the Court
Administrator (OCA) for investigation, report and recommendation.


On June
18, 1997, the OCA submitted its report and recommendation, the pertinent
portions of which state:
[2]


In the formal investigation
conducted (please see attached transcript) it was disclosed that Atty. Antonio
Valencia Jr. was appointed as the Clerk of Court V on June 18, 1992 and officially
assumed office on July 1, 1992.


As the Clerk of Court of
RTC, Branch 31, it is his duty to exercise control and supervision over the
personnel of the said court; examines records of all cases filed and
calendared; issues court processes, prepares drafts of orders and other matters
which are assigned by the Judge Regino Verediano.


In their sala each
personnel have their respective duties , from receipt of pleadings that are
being filed to their safekeeping.  In no
case is anyone allowed to interfere with the duties of each personnel except
under extreme urgency.  Thus, receiving
of pleadings is normally entrusted to the receiving clerk and no one else.  It is, as claimed by Atty. Valencia, only in
the absence of the said receiving clerk that other employees are authorized to
receive pleadings.


For his part, Atty.
Valencia claims that he rarely receives pleadings since before it reaches his
table, the same are already duly received.  Besides, it is not one of his duties to receive pleadings.


With respect to the alleged
receipt of the record on appeal by their office, specifically to him, Atty.
Valencia vehemently denied having received the same.  First, because the stroke of the alphabet indicating his initials
is very different and so with the dates, secondly, if it was actually received
it could have been brought to attention of the late Judge Verediano who
thereafter would have made a notation of the same, like all other pleadings
received in their office or simply instruct the preparation of an order if
necessary and lastly, it would have been included in their court calendar as
there was a notice of hearing attached thereto.


In the court's calendar
dated October 23, 1992, Sp. Proc. No. 35313 was never scheduled for
hearing.  Under normal circumstances, if
there was notice of hearing it would be outrightly included in the court's
calendar for October 23, 1992 as requested.


To substantiate the
aforesaid allegations Atty. Valencia submitted copies of pleadings filed
relative to the subject case bearing the notation of then Judge Verediano and
the Court's calendar for October 22 and 23, 1992.


In addition, he pointed out
that if the Notice of Appeal (Record on Appeal) was actually filed in their
sala, why was it raised for the first time only in PDIC's Motion for
Reconsideration.  This according to him
is suspicious.  He even insinuated that
nobody could have done this (meaning inserted the notice of appeal [record on
appeal] in their pleadings) except the interested lawyer/s.


Moreover, Atty. Valencia
vouches for the honesty and integrity of his staff, and if there be a need for
the examination of their signatures they would be very willing to go for a
specimen signature examination only to clear his/their names.


The office of the
undersigned  believes the claim of Atty.
Valencia that no Notice of Appeal [Record on Appeal] was filed at RTC Branch
31, Manila.  As a CPA/lawyer, he was
very well aware of his duties and responsibilities as a Branch Clerk of
Court.  This is evidenced by the fact
that in his more than five (5) years stay as a Branch Clerk of Court, no single
administrative complaint has ever been lodged against him, be it a harassment
suit or otherwise.


Moreover, if it has been
actually filed it would not have passed unnoticed by then Judge Verediano who
had to approve the same.


The undersigned is in
accord with the claim of Atty. Valencia as presented by him to Atty. Cunanan of
this Office that indeed no record on appeal was filed by the counsels of PDIC
in the subject case, thus no administrative action should be taken against
him.  (Memorandum dated June 5, 1997,
pp. 1-2; 
Rollo
, p. 538-539)


On July
23, 1997, after considering the report and it appearing that the investigation
conducted by the OCA was limited to hearing the evidence of the branch clerk of
court and his witnesses, the required the OCA to hear the evidence of
petitioner that he had filed a record on appeal but it was suppressed and,
after considering that totality of the evidence presented, to determine
liability for any wrongful act committed, and to submit its findings and
recommendations.


On
January 27, 1998, the OCA submitted its report and recommendation on the
additional investigation it conducted from which it appears that hearings were
held on three dates; the parties, through their counsel, were duly notified of
the same; and that at the first scheduled hearing on October 7, 1997, only
Atty. Marino E. Eslao, counsel for private respondent, appeared.  In order to expidite the proceedings, he was
allowed to present documentary evidence without prejudice to the right of the
petitioner to comment thereon.  During
the hearing on November 5, 1997, the parties agreed to file position papers
after the testimony of branch clerk Atty. Valencia.  On November 6, 1997, the respective testimonies of Atty. Valencia
and Atty. Pablo Romero, the sole witness for petitioner, were taken.  In his report dated December 1, 1997,
[3]
 Senior Deputy Court
Administrator Reynaldo L. Suarez summarized the evidence presented by the
parties and his findings on the same, to wit:


Atty. Pablo Romero, Manager
of R&L Litigation Center, PDIC testifies that he was the one who prepared
the subject Record on Appeal.  He
likewise confirmed the fact that the President of the PDIC, Mr. Ernest Leung,
Atty. Rosalinda Casiguran and he then went to see Judge Veridiano and was
informed by Atty. Valencia that he cannot find a copy of the Record on Appeal
which was allegedly filed.  He cannot
recall if Atty. Valencia ever demanded from him a copy of said record (pp.
28-29, TSN dated November 6, 1997).  No
other relevant information were given by Atty. Romero.


Atty. Antonio Valencia,
Branch Clerk of Court, RTC, Branch 31, Manila, was invited to testify as to
whether a Record on Appeal was actually filed before their court and the same
was duly received by him.  He was
examined by the parties, principally the counsel for PDIC.


In his testimony, Atty.
Valencia, reiterated his previous stand that he never saw a copy of the Record
on Appeal and he was positive that indeed there was no Record on Appeal having
been filed in his court.  Counsel of
PDIC however insinuated that record on appeal might have been filed but the
same was misplaced.  Atty. Valencia
assured that "this is very remote". (TSN, p. 8, November 6, 1997).


He even stressed that when
he was made earlier to comment on whether or not a record on appeal was
actually filed, he checked and double checked the original records, inquired
from the employees of RTC, Manila including the Judge whether they have
knowledge of any record on appeal which was filed in their sala but all
answered in the negative. (pp. 21 & 22, TSN, Nov. 6, 1997).


Moreover, he also firmly
denied having received the alleged copy of the record on appeal which was
presented to him for identification during his direct testimony since the
signatures appearing therein are totally different from his actual signature
(pp. 23, TSN, November 6, 1997).


It is to be noted that the
alleged duplicate original copy of the Notice of Appeal [Record on Appeal]
which is supposed to be with the counsels of PDIC was not presented as
evidence.  In fact when the counsel of
PDIC Atty. Romero was asked if the PDIC employee who allegedly filed the Record
on Appeal could testify he answered in the negative and claimed that the said
employee is already in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  No evidence was likewise presented to prove the same.  No effort was exerted by PDIC to prove the
authenticity of the signature of Clerk of Court Valencia appearing in PDIC's
copy of the Record on Appeal.


It is also worthy to note
that other than the bare testimony of Atty. Romero, no other evidence were
presented by petitioner PDIC to substantiate their claim that a Record on
Appeal was filed at the RTC of Manila and the same was duly received by Atty.
Valencia.  The testimony was not even
corroborated.


Be that as it may this
Office still has to determine as to whether a Record on Appeal was actually
filed at the court 
a quo.


A review of the record
impels a rejection of the petitioner's claim that a Record on Appeal was filed.


The private respondent was
able to present proof which are affirmative, unequivocal convincing, and
consistent.  In fact the testimony alone
of Atty. Valencia which was a reiteration of  his previous testimonies were very clear, concise, and moreover
consistent.  For the record Atty.
Valencia is viewed by the undersigned who personally conducted the
investigation as a plain, sincere and honest man who, not having been shown of
any reason to be bias or to favor any party, had no reason to deliberately tell
a falsehood relative to his official functions.  The fact therefore that he submitted himself to an investigatin
twice and in different occassions shows his determination to vindicate his honor
by proving the integrity of the records of his office.


From all indications and as
the records of the case will show  NO
RECORD ON APPEAL was actually filed in the court 
a quo.


Apparently, RTC, Branch 31,
Manila has an effective records management (system) and it is improbable to
have missed one important document (RECORD ON APPEAL).  In the absence of any convincing proof to
the contrary, the regularity of official function must be upheld.


Far from the assertions of
the petitioner we conclude that there was no Record on Appeal actually
filed.  (Memorandum dated December 11,
1997, pp. 3-5; 
Rollo
, pp. 557-559)


The
findings of the OCA are well taken.


In
civil cases, the burden of proof is on the party who would be defeated if no
evidence is given on the either side.  Plaintiff must therefore establish his case by a preponderance of
evidence, i.e. evidence as a whole which is superior to that of the defendant.
[4]
 In other words, the party
who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it.
[5]
 In this case, petitioner,
as the party claiming affirmative relief from this Court by contending that he
had filed a record on appeal in the trial court, must discharge the burden of
convincingly proving his claim.
[6]
 As found by the OCA,
however, the evidence of the respondents even outweighs that of
petitioner.  Private respondents
presented proof which are affirmative, unequivocal, convincing, and consistent
that no record on appel had been filed.  As the OCA noted, petitioner not only failed to present the PDIC
employee who allegedly filed on the record appeal in the trial court but more
importantly, he failed to prove the authenticity of the alleged signature of
Branch Clerk Antonio Valencia appearing in his copy of the record on appeal.


The
firm and consistent denial of the branch clerk that he was the one who received
the record on appeal and acknowledged its filing was disputed by petitioner.  But petitioner's witness, Atty. Romero, who
allegedly prepared the said record did not file it in the trial court.  Nor did he have any personal knowledge of
the actual filing of the record on appeal in the trial court.  According to Atty. Romero, the PDIC employee
who allegedly filed the record on appeal in the trial court could not testify
because the said employee was already in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  This allegation is not persuasive since no
evidence was presented to prove the same.
[7]


Even
the documentary evidence submitted by petitioner to prove the authenticity of
the signature of the branch clerk on the alleged duplicate original copy of the
record on appeal
[8]
 is not convincing.  The signature and notation on the alleged
duplicate original copy of the record on appeal do not match the actual
signature and handwriting of the branch clerk as shown in the pleadings
submitted by petitioner himself, namely, the notice of appeal filed by
petitioner (Annex E, Omnibus Motion), motion to strike out notice of appeal
filed by private respondents (Annex G) and comment filed by another claimant
(Annex H).  The branch clerk's alleged
signature and notation are markedly different from his signature and
handwriting appearing in the submitted documentary evidence.
[9]
 For one, the branch
clerk's initial "AV" appear "HV" in the alleged duplicate
original copy of the record.  In addition,
numeral "5" was written with a rounded stroke instead of a sharp
one.  Clearly, petitioner failed to
discharge the required burden of proof.  Hence, petitioner's assertion that he had filed a record on appeal is
not worthy of belief.


As
regards petitioner's prayer that the Court reconsider its resolution of October
13, 1995 absolving the branch clerk of court of charges of wrongdoing, suffice
it to state here that no ground exists to impute bad faith on the part of the
branch clerk.  Good faith is presumed
and the complainant has the burden of proving any wrongdoing.
[10]
 Petitioner simply failed
to prove that the branch clerk either suppressed the record on appeal allegedly
filed by petitioner did not file the said record.  The Court cannot find the branch  clerk guilty  of any wrongdoing  in certifying  that petitioner failed  to
file a record on appeal in the trial court in the face of petitioner's failure
to adduce convincing proof that such a record was in fact filed therein.


Also
for consideration are two (2) manifestations and motions for clarification
filed by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).  In its Manifestation/Motion dated May 20, 1996, LBP alleges that
on or about March 24, 1995, petitioner's deposit accounts in LBP were garnished
by Sheriff Carmelo Cachero in favor of private respondents pursuant to the writ
of execution issued by RTC Branch 31, Manila acting as the liquidation court; that
on April 10, 1995, it received from petitioner a copy of the April 7, 1995
order of this Court  directing the
parties to maintain the status 
quo
 in the case;  that on November 20, 1995, the Court issued
another resolution  directing the
parties to maintain the status 
quo
 until further orders; and that on
April 1, 1996, it received as request from the petitioner to transfer the
garnished funds to a different account maintained by petitioner in another
branch of LBP.  LBP seeks clarification
whether or not the garnishment of petitioner's deposit accounts on March 24,
1995 is null and void considering the status 
quo
 orders issued by the
Court.  It further inquires whether or
not it may acquiesce to petitioner's request to transfer the garnished funds to
petitioner's other account in another branch of LBP.
[11]
 In its Manifestation dated
October 7, 1996, on the other hand, LBP alleges that on September 9, 1996, it
received from Sheriff Adolfo Garcia a notice of garnishment over the same
deposit accounts of petitioner implementing the writ of execution issued also
by the RTC, Branch 31, Manila, but for another claimant, the Bureau of Internal
Revenue (BIR); that on September 25, 1996, it wrote Sheriff Garcia informing
him that the accounts sought to be garnished were already garnished pursuant to
the processes of the same court for another claimant (herein private
respondents); that on September 27, 1996, it received a letter from petitioner
urging it to effect the immediate release of the garnished funds to the BIR and
that on October 2, 1996, it received  from Sheriff Garcia the order to deliver to him the garnished amount of 
P
179,971,860.13.  LBP manifests that it is holding in abeyance
action on the order to Sheriff Garcia and the letter of petitioner until the
incidents in this case are finally resolved by this Court.
[12]


These
are matters largely relating to the execution of the decision of the trial
court.  As far as this Court is concerned,
its decision is now final and it no longer has any jurisdiction to pass upon
these incidents, not to mention the fact that the manifestation filed by LBP
are in the nature of consultation by one not a party to this case.


WHEREFORE
, the Court RESOLVED to
DENY petitioner's Omnibus Motion for lack of merit.  The manifestations and motions dated May 20, 1996 and October 7,
1996 by the Land Bank of the Philippines are NOTED.
