THE MINOR FRANCISCO JUAN
LARRANAGA, REPRESENTED IN THIS SUIT BY HIS MOTHER, MARGARITA G. PRESENT:
LARRANAGA, PETITIONER VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND PEOPLEÂ  OFÂ 
THE PHILIPPPINES. RESPONDENTS.

R E S O L U T I O N




PUNO, J.:


The following
are submitted before the Court for resolution:


1.an urgent motion to implement petitioners release
filed by petitioner on November 3, 1997;


2.a motion for reconsideration of this Courts
resolution of October 27, 1997 filed on November 17, 1997 by the counsels for
the prosecution in Crim. Case No. CBU-45303 and 45304;


3.a complaint filed by Judge Martin A. Ocampo,
Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 7, Cebu City, against petitioners
counsels, Attorneys Raymundo A. Armovit, Ramon R. Teleron and Bernardito
Florido, for allegedly deliberately withholding from this Court the omnibus
order, supplemental order and order of arraignment he issued on October 17,
1997, thus misleading the  Court into
issuing its resolution of  October 27,
1997;  and 


4.an urgent motion to change the venue and the
officers to conduct the preliminary investigation filed by petitioner on
November 17, 1997.


The antecedent
facts:


Petitioner
Francisco Juan Larranaga is charged with two counts of kidnapping and serious
illegal detention docketed as CBU-45303 and CBU-45304 pending before the
Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 7, Cebu City.  He is presently detained at the Bagong Buhay Rehabilitation Center.    


On October 1,
1997, petitioner, represented by his mother, Margarita G. Larranaga,  filed with this Court a petition for
certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with writs of preliminary prohibitory and
mandatory injunction.  Petitioner
alleged that he was denied the right to preliminary investigation and sought to
annul the informations as well as the warrant of arrest issued in consequence
thereof.  In the alternative,
petitioner prayed that a preliminary investigation be conducted and that he be
released from detention pending the investigation.
[1]
 Petitioner filed a supplemental
petition for habeas corpus or bail on October 6, 1997.
[2]
 


On October 20,
1997, the Solicitor General filed a manifestation and motion in lieu of comment
submitting that petitioner should have been given a regular preliminary
investigation before the filing of  the
informations and the issuance of the warrant of arrest. The Solicitor General
recommended that petitioner be accorded his right to preliminary investigation
and that he be released from detention during the pendency thereof.
[3]


On October 27,
1997, we issued a resolution holding that petitioner was deprived of his right
to preliminary investigation when the City Prosecutor of Cebu insisted that he
was only entitled to an inquest investigation.
[4]
 Hence, we resolved:  


  1.  to set aside the inquest investigation of
petitioner and to order the Office of the City Prosecutor of Cebu to conduct a
regular preliminary investigation of the petitioner in accord with Section 3,
Rule 112;


  2.  to annul the Order for Detention During The
Pendency of the Case issued by Executive Judge Priscila Agana against the
petitioner in Crim. Case No. CBU-45303 and 45304;  


  3. to order
the immediate release of petitioner pending his preliminary  investigation; and 


4. to order the Presiding Judge of Br. VII, RTC of
Cebu City to cease and desist from proceeding with the arraignment and trial of
petitioner in Crim. Case No. CBU-45303 and 45304, pending the result of
petitioners preliminary investigation.


On October 30,
1997, petitioner filed with the RTC of Cebu an urgent 
ex parte
 motion
praying for his immediate release pursuant to our October 27 resolution.
[5]


The following
day, on October 31, 1997, Judge Martin A. Ocampo, Presiding Judge of RTC Branch
7, Cebu City, issued an order deferring the resolution of petitioners
motion.  It stated that it would be
premature to act on the motion since the trial court has not yet received an
official copy of our October 27 resolution and that said resolution has not yet
attained finality.  Furthermore, Judge
Ocampo called the Courts attention to the fact that petitioner has been
arraigned on October 14, 1997 and waived his right to preliminary investigation.
[6]


On November 3,
1997, petitioner filed with this Court an urgent motion praying, among others,
that Judge Ocampo be directed to order petitioners immediate release upon
receipt of our October 27 resolution.
[7]


Judge Ocampo
filed with this Court a letter-complaint dated November 3, 1997 alleging that
petitioners counsels, Attorneys Raymundo A. Armovit, Ramon R. Teleron and
Bernardito Florido, deliberately withheld from this Court the omnibus order,
supplemental order and order of arraignment, all issued by him on October 14,
1997 in connection with Crim. Case No. CBU-45303 and 45304. Judge Ocampo
alleged that by withholding said orders, petitioners counsels unwittingly
misled the Court in its October 27 resolution.
[8]


On November 17,
1997, the counsels for the prosecution in Crim. Case No. CBU-45303 and 45304
filed a motion for reconsideration of our October 27 resolution.
[9]
 They raised the following
arguments:


1. Petitioner is charged with a continuing offense;  hence, his arrest and detention about two
months after the abduction of the victims was lawful;


2. Since petitioner was arrested without a warrant, his case comes
within the purview of Section 7 of Rule 112, not  under Section 3 thereof;


3. The filing of the informations in court and the issuance of the
corresponding warrants of arrest by Executive Judge Priscila S. Agana cured
whatever defect there was in petitioners arrest and detention;


4. Petitioner was validly arraigned on October 14, 1997 and the validity
of such arraignment was not set aside by this tribunal;  


5. The case of Sanchez v. Demetriou
squarely applies to the instant case; and


6. Petitioner is no longer a minor
pursuant to R.A. 6809.


The Solicitor
General, meanwhile, in its comment to petitioners urgent motion for release,
modified its stance regarding the validity of petitioners detention.
[10]
 It stated:


Considering that
petitioner was arraigned (a supervening event after the filing of the petition
and before the issuance of the TRO), petitioner should be kept in detention
without prejudice to his right to preliminary investigation.
[11]


Petitioner also
filed on November 17, 1997 an urgent motion to transfer the venue of the
preliminary investigation from Cebu City to Manila and to replace the Office of
the City Prosecutor of Cebu with the Office of the State Prosecutor, Department
of Justice, as the authority to conduct the preliminary investigation because
of the extensive coverage of the proceedings by the Cebu media which allegedly
influenced the peoples perception of petitioners character and guilt.
[12]


The primary
issues to be resolved are:  (1) whether
petitioner is entitled to a regular preliminary investigation, and (2) whether
petitioner should be released from detention pending the investigation.


We resolve the
first issue in the affirmative.


The prosecutors
argue that petitioner is entitled only to an inquest investigation under
Section 7 of Rule 112 since he was lawfully arrested without a warrant under
Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of  Court.  


The prosecutors
argument is bereft of merit.  Section 7
of Rule 112
[13]
 applies only to persons lawfully
arrested without a warrant.  Petitioner
in this case was,  in the first place,
not arrested either by a peace officer or a private person.  The facts show that on September 15, 1997,
some members of the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation Group
(PNP CIG) went to the Center for Culinary Arts in Quezon City to arrest
petitioner, 
albeit
 without warrant.  Petitioner resisted the arrest and  immediately phoned his sister and brother-in-law.  Petitioners sister sought the aid of  Atty. Raymundo A. Armovit.  Atty. Armovit, over the phone, dissuaded the
police officers from carrying out the warrantless arrest and proposed to meet
with them at the CIG headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City.  The police officers  yielded and returned to the CIG
headquarters.  Petitioner, together with
his sister and brother-in-law also went to the CIG headquarters aboard their
own vehicle. Atty. Armovit questioned the legality of the warrantless arrest
before CIG Legal Officer Ruben Zacarias.  After consulting with his superiors,  Legal Officer Zacarias ordered to stop the arrest and allowed petitioner
to go home.  Atty. Armovit made an
undertaking in writing that he and petitioner would appear before the Cebu City
Prosecutor on September 17, 1997 for preliminary investigation.


An arrest is
defined as the taking of a person into custody in order that he may be bound to
answer for the commission of an offense.
[14]
 It is made by an actual restraint
of the person to be arrested, or by his submission to the custody of the person
making the arrest.
[15]
 An arrest signifies restraint on
person, depriving one of his own will and liberty, binding him to become
obedient to the will of the law.
[16]
 The foregoing facts show no
restraint upon the person of petitioner.  Neither do they show that petitioner was deprived of  his own will and liberty.  Hence, Section 7 of Rule 112 does not apply
to petitioner.


To be sure, even
if petitioner were arrested by the PNP CIG personnel, such arrest would still
be illegal because of the absence of a warrant.  Section 5 of Rule 113 states when a warrantless arrest is deemed
lawful, thus:


Sec. 5.
    
Arrest without a warrant;  when lawful.-A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant,
arrest a person:


(a)When, in his presence, the
person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting
to commit an offense;


(b)When an offense has in fact just
been committed, and he has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the
person to be arrested has committed it;  and 


(c)When the person to be arrested
is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is
serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or
has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.


In cases falling under paragraphs
(a) and (b) hereof, the person arrested without a warrant shall be
forthwith  delivered to the nearest
police station or jail, and he shall be proceeded against in accordance with
Rule 112, Section 7.


It does not
appear in the case at bar that petitioner has just committed, is actually
committing or is attempting to commit an offense  when the police officers tried to arrest him on September 15,
1997.  In fact,  petitioner was attending classes at the
Center for Culinary Arts at that time.


We reject the
prosecutors' argument that petitioner was actually committing a crime at the
time of the arrest since kidnapping with serious illegal detention is a
continuing crime.  In the case of
Parulan v. Director of Prisons
[17]
 cited by the prosecutors,
kidnapping with illegal detention is considered a continuing crime where the
deprivation of liberty is persistent and continuing from one place to another.
The facts show that the alleged kidnapping was committed on July 16, 1997.  One of the victims, Marijoy Chiong, was
found dead in Sitio Tanawan, Barangay Guadalupe, Carcar, Cebu on July 18, 1997,
while the other victim, Jacqueline Chiong, remains missing to date.  There is no showing  that at the time of the arrest on September
15, 1997, Jacqueline Chiong was being detained by petitioner who was then
residing in Quezon City. Hence, petitioner may not be considered as continually
committing the crime of kidnapping with serious illegal detention at the time
of the arrest.


Judge Martin
Ocampo of RTC Branch 7, Cebu City, and the state prosecutors assert that
petitioner is no longer entitled to a preliminary investigation because he had
previously waived his right to such investigation.  In his omnibus order dated October 14, 1997, Judge Ocampo held
that petitioner waived his right to preliminary investigation when he failed to
appear during the preliminary investigation set by the City Prosecutor in the
afternoon of September 17, 1997, despite the express warning that "failure
of the counsel (to present the petitioner to the Cebu City Prosecutor on said
time and date) would be treated as a waiver of his clients right to preliminary
investigation."


We
disagree.  A waiver, whether express or
implied, must be made in clear and unequivocal manner.  Mere failure of petitioner and his counsel
to appear before the City Prosecutor in the afternoon of September 17, 1997
cannot be construed as a waiver of his right to preliminary investigation,
considering that petitioner has been vigorously invoking his right to a regular
preliminary investigation since the start of the proceedings before the City
Prosecutor.  At 9:00 in the morning of
September 17, 1997, petitioners counsel appeared before the City Prosecutor of
Cebu and moved that petitioner be accorded a regular preliminary
investigation.  The City Prosecutor,
however, denied the motion, stating that petitioner is entitled only to an
inquest investigation.  Petitioner
orally moved for a reconsideration, to no avail.  Petitioner assailed the decision of the City Prosecutor before
the Court of Appeals on a petition for 
certiorari
, prohibition and 
mandamus
.  After the Court of Appeals dismissed said
petition, petitioner went to this Court, still asserting that he should be
accorded a regular preliminary investigation.  


Furthermore,
petitioner and his counsel cannot be faulted for their refusal to comply with
the City Prosecutors directive to appear before him in the afternoon of
September 17, 1997 for preliminary investigation.  As stated above,  petitioners counsel appeared before the City Prosecutor earlier that day
and specifically demanded a regular preliminary investigation for his
client.  The City Prosecutor, however,
insisted that petitioner was entitled only to an inquest investigation which he
scheduled in the afternoon of the same  day.  Petitioner and his counsel
refused to submit to such investigation as it might be construed as a waiver of
petitioners right to a regular preliminary investigation.  


Our ruling is
not altered by the fact that petitioner has been arraigned on October 14, 1997.
The rule is that the right to preliminary investigation is waived when the
accused fails to invoke it before or at the time of entering a plea at
arraignment.
[18]
 Petitioner, in this case, has been
actively and consistently demanding a regular preliminary investigation even
before he was charged in court.  Also,
petitioner refused to enter a plea during the arraignment because there was a
pending case in this Court regarding his right to avail of a regular
preliminary investigation.
[19]
 Clearly, the acts of petitioner and
his counsel are inconsistent with a waiver.  Preliminary investigation is part of procedural due process.  It cannot be waived unless the waiver
appears to be clear and informed.


The next
question is whether petitioner should be released from detention pending the
investigation.  


We rule in the
negative.


The records show
that on September 17, 1997, two informations were filed against petitioner for
kidnapping and serious illegal detention.
[20]
 Executive Judge Priscila Agana
issued a warrant of arrest on September 19, 1997.
[21]
 Petitioner was arrested on
September 22, 1997 by virtue of said warrant.  We held in Sanchez v. Demetriou
[22]
 that the filing of charges and the
issuance of the warrant of arrest against a person invalidly detained will cure
the defect of that detention or at least deny him the right to be released
because of such defect.  The Court
ruled:


The original warrantless arrest of
the petitioner was doubtless illegal.  Nevertheless, the Regional Trial Court lawfully acquired jurisdiction
over the person of the petitioner by virtue of the warrant of arrest it issued
on August 26, 1993 against him and the other accused in connection with the
rape-slay cases.  It was belated, to be
sure, but it was nonetheless legal.


Even on the assumption that no
warrant was issued at all, we find that the trial court still lawfully acquired
jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner.  The rule is that if the accused objects to the jurisdiction of
the court over his person, he may move to quash the information, but only on
that ground.  If, as in this case, the
accused raises other grounds in the motion to quash, he is deemed to have
waived that objection and to have submitted his person to the jurisdiction of
the court.


The Court notes that on August 13,
1993, after the petitioner was unlawfully arrested, Judge Lanzanas issued a
warrant of arrest against Antonio L. Sanchez in connection with Criminal Cases
Nos. 93-124634 to 93-124637 for violation of R.A. No. 6713.  Pending the issuance of the warrant of
arrest for the rape-slay cases, this first warrant served as the initial
justification for his detention.


The Court also adverts to its
uniform ruling that the filing of charges, and the issuance of the
corresponding warrant of arrest, against a person invalidly detained will cure
the defect of that detention or at least deny him the right to be released
because of such defect.  Applicable by
analogy to the case at bar is Rule 102 Section 4 of the Rules of Court that:


Sec. 4.  When writ is not allowed or discharge authorized.-If it appears
that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an
officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or
order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to
issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not
be allowed;  or if the jurisdiction
appears after the writ is allowed, the person shall not be discharged by reason
of any informality or defect in the process, judgment, or order.  Nor shall anything in this rule be held to
authorize the discharge of a person charged with or convicted of an offense in
the Philippines or of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment.


In one case, the petitioner sued on

habeas corpus
 on the ground that she had been arrested by virtue of a
John Doe warrant.  In their return, the
respondents declared that a new warrant specifically naming her had been
issued, thus validating her detention.  While frowning at the tactics of the respondents, the Court said:


The case has, indeed, become moot
and academic inasmuch as the new warrant of arrest complies with the
requirements of the Constitution and the Rules of Court regarding the
particular description of the person to be arrested.  While the first warrant was unquestionably void, being a general
warrant, release of the petitioner for that reason will be a futile act as it
will be followed by her immediate re-arrest pursuant to the new and valid
warrant, returning her to the same prison she will just have left.  This Court will not participate in such a meaningless
charade.


The same doctrine
has been consistently followed by the Court more recently in the Umil case.
[23]
 (citations omitted)


We hold,
therefore, that petitioners detention at the Bagong Buhay Rehabilitation
Center  is legal in view of the
information and the warrant of arrest against him.  The absence of a preliminary investigation will not justify
petitioners release because such defect did not nullify the information and the
warrant of arrest against him.
[24]
 We ruled in Sanciangco, Jr. v.
People:
[25]
 


The absence of
preliminary investigations does not affect the courts jurisdiction over the
case.  Nor do they impair the validity
of the information or otherwise render it defective;  but, if there were no preliminary investigations and the
defendants, before entering their plea, invite the attention of the court to
their absence, the court, instead of dismissing the information, should conduct
it or remand the case to the inferior court so that the preliminary
investigation may be conducted.
[26]


As regards
petitioners motion to change the venue and the authority to conduct the
preliminary investigation, we are constrained to dismiss the same for lack of
jurisdiction.  The holding of  a preliminary investigation is a function of
the Executive Department and not of the Judiciary.
[27]
 Petitioner should therefore address
their plea to the Department of Justice that has control and supervision over
the conduct of preliminary investigations.


Nonetheless,
even if the Court had jurisdiction over the issue, petitioners motion should
still be denied because it failed to allege and prove that the City Prosecutor
of Cebu has been actually affected by the publicity.  We held in Webb v. De Leon:
[28]


Be that as it may,
we recognize that pervasive and prejudicial publicity under certain
circumstances can deprive an accused of his due process right to fair
trial.  Thus, in 
Martelino, et al.
vs. Alejandro, et al.
, we held that to warrant a finding of prejudicial
publicity there must be allegation and proof that the judges have been unduly
influenced, not simply that they might be, by the barrage of publicity.  In the case at bar, we find nothing in the
records that will prove that the tone and  content of the publicity that attended the investigation of petitioners
fatally infected the fairness and impartiality of the DOJ Panel.  Petitioners cannot just rely on the
subliminal effects of publicity on the sense of fairness of the DOJ Panel, for
these are basically unbeknown and beyond knowing.  To be sure, the DOJ Panel is composed of an Assistant Chief State
Prosecutor and Senior State Prosecutors.  Their long experience in criminal investigation is a factor to consider
in determining whether they can easily be blinded by the klieg lights of
publicity.  Indeed, their 26-page
Resolution carries no indubitable indicia of bias for it does not appear that
they considered any extra-record evidence except evidence properly adduced by
the parties.  The length of time the
investigation was conducted despite its summary nature and the generosity with
which they accommodated the discovery motions of petitioners speak well of
their fairness.  At no instance, we
note, did petitioners seek the disqualification of any member of the DOJ Panel
on the ground of bias resulting from their bombardment of prejudicial
publicity.
[29]


We further held
in People v. Teehankee:
[30]


We cannot sustain appellants claim
that he was denied the right to impartial trial due to prejudicial
publicity.  It is true that the print
and broadcast media gave the case at bar pervasive publicity, just like all
high profile and high stake criminal trials.  
Then and now, we rule that the right of an accused to a fair trial is
not incompatible to a free press
.  To be sure, responsible reporting enhances an accuseds right to a fair
trial for, as well pointed out, a responsible press has always been regarded as
the handmaiden of effective judicial administration, especially in the criminal
field  x x x.  The press does not simply publish information about trials but
guards against the miscarriage of justice by subjecting the police, prosecutors,
and judicial processes to extensive public scrutiny and criticism.


Pervasive publicity is not 
per
se
 prejudicial to the right of an accused to fair trial.  The mere fact that the trial of the
appellant was given a day-to-day, gavel-to-gavel coverage does not by itself
prove that the publicity so permeated the mind of the trial judge and impaired
his impartiality.  For one, it is
impossible to seal the minds of members of the bench from pre-trial and other
off-court publicity of sensational criminal cases.  The state of the art of our communication system brings news as
they happen straight to our breakfast tables and to our bedrooms.  These news form part of our everyday menu of
the facts and fictions of life. For another, or idea of a  fair and impartial judge is not that of a
hermit who is out of touch with the world. We have not installed the jury
system whose members are overly protected from publicity lest they lose their
impartiality. Criticisms against the jury system are mounting and Mark Twainâs
wit and wisdom put them all in better perspective when he observed: âWhen a
getleman of high social standing, intellegence, and probity swears that
testimony given under the same oath will overweigh with him, street talk and
newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay, he is worth a hundred jurymen who
will swear to their own ignorance and stupidity xxx. Why could not the jury law
be so altered as to give men of brains and honesty an equal chance with fools
and miscreants?â Our judges are learned in the law and trained to disregard
off-court evidence and on-camera performances of parties to a litigation. Their
mere exposure to publications and publicity stunts does not per se fatally
infect their impartiality 


At best, appellant
can only conjure possibility of prejudice on the part of the trial judge due to
the barrage of publicity that characterized the investigation and trial of the
case.  In 
Martelino, et al. v.
Alejandro, et al
., we rejected this standard of possibility of prejudice
and adopted the test of 
actual prejudice
 as we ruled that to warrant a
finding of prejudicial publicity, there must be allegation and proof that the
judges have been unduly influenced, not simply that they might be, by the
barrage of publicity.  In the case at
bar, the records do not show that the trial judge developed
 actual bias 
  against appellant as a consequence of the
extensive media coverage of the pre-trial and trial of his case.  The 
totality
 
of
 
circumstances

of the case does not prove this actual bias and he has not discharged the
burden.
[31]


We likewise
dismiss the complaint filed by Judge Martin A. Ocampo against Attorneys
Raymundo A. Armovit, Ramon R. Teleron and Bernardito Florido for lack of
concrete evidence to prove that said lawyers deliberately withheld from the Court
the orders he issued with intent to mislead the Court.


Finally, we also
deny the motion of the prosecutors to dismiss the petition on the ground that
it was not filed by the proper party.  The prosecutors argue that petitioner Francisco Juan Larranaga is no
longer a minor under R.A. 6809, thus, his mother, Margarita G. Larranaga, does
not have the authority to file the instant petition as his representative.  It appears, however, that on October 6,
1997, petitioners mother filed a supplemental petition for 
habeas corpus

on his behalf.  This converted the
petition at bar to one for 
habeas corpus
.  Section 3, Rule 102 of the Revised Rules of Court states that a
petition for 
habeas corpus 
may be filed either by the party for whose
relief it is intended or by some person on  his behalf.  


IN VIEW
WHEREOF,  we resolve to:  (1)  REITERATE our order to the Office of the City Prosecutor of Cebu to
conduct a regular preliminary investigation of petitioner and to the Presiding
Judge of  RTC, Branch 7, Cebu City to
cease and desist from proceeding with the trial of petitioner until a
preliminary investigation shall have been conducted;  (2) SET ASIDE our order to immediately release petitioner pending
the preliminary investigation and thus DENY petitioners urgent motion to
implement petitioners release; (3) DISMISS Judge Ocampos complaint against
Attorneys Raymundo A. Armovit, Ramon R. Teleron and Bernardito Florido; and (4)
DENY petitioners motion to change the venue and the authority to conduct the
preliminary investigation.

  Sec 7.  When accused lawfully arrested without warrant. - When a person is lawfully
arrested without a warrant for an offense cognizable by the Regional Trial
Court, the complaint or information may be filed by the offended party, peace
officer or fiscal without a preliminary investigation having been first
conducted, on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting
officer of person.


However, before the filing of such complaint or information,
the person arrested may ask for a preliminary investigation by a proper officer
in accordance with this Rule, but he must sign a waiver of the provisions of
Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, with the assistance of a
lawyer and in case of non-availability of a lawyer, a responsible person of his
choice.  Notwithstanding such waiver, he
may apply for bail as provided in the corresponding rule and the investigation
must be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its inception.


If the case has been filed in court without a preliminary
investigation having been first conducted, the accused may within five (5) days
from the time he learns of the filing of the information, ask for a preliminary
investigation with the same right to adduce evidence in his favor in the manner
prescribed in this Rule.
