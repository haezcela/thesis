[ G.R. No. 119320, March 13, 1998 ]


OCEAN EAST AGENCY CORP., EUROPEAN NAVIGATION, INC. &
STANDARD INSURANCE CO., INC., PETITIONERS,VS. THE NATIONAL LABOR
RELATIONS COMMISSIONÂ  (NLRC-FIRST
DIVISION), ANDÂ  CAPT. PEPITO M. GUCOR,
RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


On September 28, 1991, respondent
Capt. Pepito M. Gucor was hired by petitioner Ocean East Agency Corp. (Ocean
East), the manning agent of herein co-petitioner European Navigation, Inc.
(ENI), as master of M/V âAlpineâ for a period of one (1) year with a monthly
salary of US$840.00.  Sometime in
February 1992, while the M/V âAlpineâ was anchored at the Port of Havana, Cuba,
respondent was informed of his repatriation for his subsequent transfer to
another vessel.


Perceiving the transfer as an
insult to his professional competence, Capt. Gucor signified that, unless his
full benefits are accorded him, he shall refuse to leave the vessel knowing the
cause for his repatriation to be unreasonable.  In an effort to assuage his fears, petitioners Ocean East and ENI
advised him that his services were not terminated at all, the repatriation
being solely for documentation purposes.  On February 29, 1992, after his demands were fully settled,  respondent agreed to be repatriated.  Petitioner alleged that in view of
respondentâs earlier refusal to be repatriated and to man the newly-acquired MV
âHavre de Grace,â it was compelled to assign another master to the said
vessel.  Thereafter, the company decided
to assign him to MV âEleptheria-K,â whose master was going on leave on February
27, which, however, respondent likewise missed for failure to disembark when
ordered to do so.


On the ground of serious
misconduct or willful disobedience, petitioner terminated the services of
respondent.  In a complaint for illegal
dismissal, on December 1, 1993, Philippine Overseas Employment Administration
(POEA), through Administrator Felicisimo O. Joson, dismissed the said complaint
for lack of merit finding respondentâs apprehension as premature and that petitioners
were merely acting in the exercise of their management prerogative.


On appeal, this decision was
reversed by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in its decision
dated November 29, 1994, the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, the appealed decision is hereby set aside.  The respondents are hereby directed to
jointly and severally pay complainant his salary, overtime pay, vacation leave
and other benefits corresponding to the unexpired portion of his contract.


SO ORDERED.â
[1]


Its motion for reconsideration
having been denied, petitioners filed the instant petition.


The principal issue in this case
is whether or not the transfer clause of the Standard Employment Contract (SEC)
[2]
 is violative of Article 34(i) of the Labor Code.


Said clause provides that:


âThe CREWMEMBER agrees to be transferred  at any port to any vessel owned or operated, manned or managed by
the same employer provided it is accredited to the same manning agent and
provided further that the rating of the crewmember and the rate of his wages
and  terms of service are in no way
inferior and the total period of employment shall not exceed that originally
agreed upon.â


Article 34(i) of the Labor Code,
on the other hand, reads:


â(i)  It shall be unlawful
for âany individual, entity, licensee or holder of authority to substitute or
alter employment contract approved and verified by the Department of Labor from
the time of actual signing thereof by the parties up to and including the
periods of expiration of the same 
without the approval of the Secretary of
Labor
.â


The NLRC, in setting aside the
decision of the POEA, ruled that the intended transfer of Capt. Gucor to
another vessel was in effect an alteration of  his original contract which could not be done without the approval of
the Secretary of Labor.


The NLRCâs ruling does not
persuade.


It must be noted that the standard
employment contract was adopted and approved conformably with Section 3, Rule
II, Book V of the POEA Rules and Regulations which reads as follows:


âSection 3. - Standard Employment Contract.  The Administration shall undertake
development and/or periodic review of region, country and skills specific
employment contracts for landbased 
workers and
conduct regular review of standard employment contracts (SEC) for
seafarers.  These contracts shall
provide for minimum employment standards herein enumerated under Section 2
[3]
 of this Rule and shall recognize the prevailing labor
and social legislations at the site of employment and international
conventions.  The SEC shall set the
minimum terms and conditions of employment.  All employers and principals shall adopt the SEC in connection with the
hiring of workers without prejudice to their adoption of other terms and
conditions of employment over and above the minimum standards of the
Administration.â


On the other hand, elucidating the
rationale behind Article 34 (i), this Court held in 
Seagull Maritime Corp.,
et al. v. Balatongan, et al
.,
[4]
 thus:


âThe reason why the law requires that the POEA should approve and
verify a contract under Article 34(i) of the Labor Code 
is to insure that
the employee shall not thereby be placed in a disadvantageous position and that
the same are within the minimum standards of the terms and conditions of such
employment contract set by the POEA
.  This is why a standard format for employment contracts has been adopted
by the Department of Labor.â (Underscoring supplied)


Apparently, there is no
inconsistency between Article 34(i) of the Labor Code and the transfer clause
under the SEC.  On the contrary, the
latter even complements the other by way of resolving the complex demands of
seafarers whose services may entail occasional transfer from one vessel to
another.  Obviously, the transfer clause
is not without limitations.  Thus, a
transfer is sanctioned only if it is to any vessel owned or operated, manned or
managed by the same employer provided it is accredited to the same manning
agent and that the rating of the crewmember, his wages and terms of service are
in no way inferior and the total period of employment shall not exceed that
originally agreed upon.  In the instant
case, respondentâs assignment to another vessel owned by European Navigation
and accredited to the same manning agent, therefore, under no circumstance,
violated Article 34(i) of the Labor Code.  The transfer clause is deemed incorporated into the original contract;
hence, the approval of the Secretary of Labor is no longer necessary.


Accordingly, we conclude that
petitioners merely availed of what the employment contract allows.  Indeed, it was nothing more than an
application of  the subject provision.


With regard to the finding of
illegal dismissal, the pertinent provision of the Labor Code states:


âArt. 282.  
Termination
by employer
.


An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following
causes:


a.
      
Serious misconduct or
wilful disobedience by the employer of the lawful orders of his employer or
representative in connection with his work;


     
x x x
     
x x x
     
x x x.â


In 
AHS Philippines, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals
,
[5]
 we held that in order that an employer may terminate
an employee on the ground of willful disobedience to the formerâs order,
regulations or instructions, it must be established that the said orders,
regulation or instructions are (a) reasonable and lawful, (b) sufficiently
known to the employee, and (c) in connection with the duties which the employee
has been engaged to discharge.


In the instant case, petitioners
have conscientiously apprised respondent that his repatriation was solely for
documentation purposes preliminary to his transfer to another vessel which the
management believes him to be more familiar with.  Respondentâs defiance of a lawful order posed serious and
considerable prejudice to the business of the employer.  This Court finds that petitionerâs order was
made within the sphere of its management prerogative.  âThe exercise of an employer to regulate all aspects of
employment must be in keeping with good faith and not be used as a pretext for
defeating the rights of employees under the laws and applicable contracts.â
[6]
 A perusal of the records shows a clear, valid and
legal cause for the termination of respondentâs employment.  As correctly viewed by the Solicitor
General:


âCapt. Gucorâs refusal to disembark and turn over command of his
vessel to its new master when instructed to do so caused great pecuniary damage
to his employer.  The vessel was at
anchorage for a long time disrupting its schedule.  Not only that.  He was not
able to take command of the M/V Havre de Grace, forcing European Navigation to
make the arrangements and assign a new master to it.  European Navigation, exercising maximum tolerance in spite of
Capt. Gucorâs insubordination, even went as far as assigning him to the M/V
Eleptheria-K after he missed the M/V Havre de Grace.  He likewise missed this assignment.  All this because he believed that his transfer was an insult to
his personal and professional capacity.


Capt. Gucor willfully disobeyed a
lawful order of his employer.  This act
of insubordination is a valid ground for dismissal.â
