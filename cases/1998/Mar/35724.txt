In 
Nelia B.
Esmeralda-Baroy v. Edmundo B. Peralta
, docketed as A.M. No. MTJ-93-751,
[1]
 Baroy (former Clerk of Court of the
MTC, Tinambac, Camarines Sur) filed a sworn complaint against Edmundo B.
Peralta (Court Interpreter likewise of MTC, Tinambac, Camarines Sur) charging
the latter with (a) infidelity in the custody of documents; (b) falsification
and irregularity in the accomplishment of daily time records (DTR); (c) gross
insubordination and willful disregard of express or implied directives and
refusal to obey reasonable orders of  superior; (d) absence without official leave (AWOL); (e) violation of
court regulations, i.e., removing documents, evidence and exhibits from the
office and bringing them outside without court order; (f) dereliction and
abandonment of duty; and (g) incompetence and inefficiency in the performance
of official function.
[2]


The
specifications of the charges and respondent Peraltaâs respective answers
thereto may be summarized as follows:


Infidelity in
the custody of public documents
.  On or about
October 29, 1992, Edmundo B. Peralta willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
removed, concealed, hid and destroyed court exhibits, namely:  Exhibits âBâ, âDâ, â7â and â7-Aâ in Criminal
Case No. 5719 and Exhibits âAâ, âBâ, âCâ, â1â and â2â in Criminal Case No.
5682, entrusted to him for safekeeping to the damage and prejudice of the
parties who offered the same as evidence.


Peralta, in his
answer, claims that he already submitted Exhibits âBâ, âDâ â7â and â7-Aâ in
Criminal Case No. 5719 to Judge Palaypayon inside the latterâs chamber and in
the presence of Atty. Elmer Briaso, counsel for the accused therein, as early
as October 15, 1992.  Consequently, the
loss of the said exhibits cannot be attributed to him but to the person who was
in custody of them at the time of the alleged loss.  With respect to Exhibits âAâ, âBâ, âCâ, â1â and â2â in Criminal
Case No. 5682, Peralta avers that he tried to turn them over to complainant
Baroy but the latter refused to accept the same.  Hence, he forwarded the same to their office by registered mail.


Falsification
and irregularity in the accomplishment of daily time records (DTRs)
.  Peralta falsified his DTRs covering the period between August 10, 1992
to October 29, 1992, in that he made it appear on the Attendance Logbook and
Form 48 that he arrived on time when in truth and in fact, he was always 20-40
minutes late.


Peralta denies
these allegations.  He contends that
complainant Baroy affixed her signature on said DTRs after verifying their
contents, thus, she is estopped from questioning their alleged
irregularity.  


Gross
insubordination and willful disregard of express or implied orders of a
superior
.   Peralta refused to act as interpreter, as
his job requires, in the preliminary investigation of Criminal Case No. 5764.


In answer,
Peralta avers that he did not disobey the order for him to act as interpreter
but only refused to go inside Judge Palaypayonâs chamber unless the latter
divested himself of his gun and deposit the same with the police.


Absence
without official leave (AWOL
).  Peralta was
absent without official leave from October 29, 1992 to November 17, 1992.


Peralta
alleges  that he filed a leave of
absence covering said period upon his return to work as was the usual court
practice.


Violation of
court regulations
.  Peralta removed documents, evidence and
exhibits from the office and brought them out without court order or proper
authorization.


Peralta contends
that the reason for what he did was that he did not trust complainant Baroy nor
Judge Palaypayon to safekeep the said documents.  He maintains that he was afraid of being framed of any
wrongdoing or of being blamed in case of  loss of said documents considering the animosity prevailing in said
office.


Dereliction
and abandonment of duty
.  Peralta is guilty of the
following acts, 
viz
:  (a)
negligently misplacing court processes and official communications; (b)
loitering and gallivanting outside the office during office hours; (c) viewing
betamax during office hours; (d) sleeping inside the session hall; (e)
continuously ignoring directives of the Clerk of Court requiring his comment
concerning his misdeeds or giving  disrespectful answers; (f) refusing to pay his debt of P100.00 as
contribution for the 1991 Christmas party; (g) getting the salaries of his
officemates while on AWOL without informing the court; and (h) incompetence and
inefficiency in the performance of his official function as interpreter.


Peralta denies
he ever committed the foregoing acts and alleges that they are pure lies.


The charge of 
incompetence
and inefficiency in the performance of official function 
is subsumed in the
preceding charge.


II


In 
Edmundo B.
Peralta, et al. v. Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr.
, likewise docketed as
A.M. No. MTJ-93-751, Peralta filed a letter-complaint charging Judge Palaypayon
with harassment and grave misconduct.  Complainant Peralta alleges that he was unjustly cited for direct contempt
of court and ordered arrested by respondent judge for his refusal to attend the
preliminary investigation in Criminal Case No. 5764 and act as interpreter
therein.  He further alleges that his
polite refusal was due to the fact that he feared for his safety, thus, he did
not want to go inside respondent judgeâs chamber where he claimed the latter
kept a short firearm inside a drawer.  As a consequence, Peralta was sentenced by respondent judge to suffer
five (5) days imprisonment.


Respondent judge
vigorously denied the foregoing charges and claimed that Peralta was cited in
direct contempt of court for his refusal to perform his official duty as court
interpreter inside his chamber.  He
denied possessing/keeping a gun inside his drawer.


III


In 
Judge
Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr. v. Edmundo B. Peralta
, docketed as A.M. No.
P-93-801, Judge Palaypayon filed a sworn letter-complaint charging Peralta with
(a) infidelity in the custody of public documents; (b) bringing out court
records without authority; (c) refusal to perform official duty; (d)
disobedience and insubordination of office rules; and (e) irregularity in
attendance.
[3]
 The allegations in the 1
st
, 2
nd
, 3
rd
 and 5
th
 charges are identical with the charges
in A.M. No. MTJ-93-751 entitled Nelia Esmeralda-Baroy v. Edmundo B.
Peralta.  The allegations in the
remaining 4
th
 charge consist of the following, to
wit:  (a) Peraltaâs failure to wear
office uniforms and to heed the order prohibiting the reading of magazines or
newspapers during office hours;  (b) his
failure to attend to litigants who wish to transact official business with the
court;  and (c)  his failure to turn over all the records and
exhibits he placed in the bodega despite court order and despite the fact that
he was relieved as court custodian.


These charges
were vehemently denied by Peralta.


IV


The fourth
administrative complaint, which is based on a letter-complaint of Judge
Palaypayon dated July 29, 1993 to Executive Judge David C. Naval recommends the
summary dismissal of respondent Edmundo Peralta.  Essentially, the complaint relates to the alleged refusal
of  respondent Peralta to obey the order
of his superior to act as interpreter  during the preliminary investigation conducted on November 18, 1992 in
Criminal Case No. 5752 and on November 19, 1992 in Criminal Case No. 5764 which
is the subject in A. M. No. MTJ-93-751 and A.M. No. P-93-801 where he was cited
for direct contempt.


On May 17, 1993,
A.M. No. P-93-801 was ordered consolidated with A.M. No. MTJ-93-751.
[4]


The cases were
thereafter referred to Executive Judge David C. Naval of the Regional Trial
Court of Naga City, for investigation, report and recommendation.  Upon Judge Navalâs inhibition, First Vice
Executive Judge Antonio N. Gerona was designated in his stead.


Joint hearings
were set for the said cases.


On August 9,
1995, complainant Baroy filed a manifestation with the investigating judge
informing the latter that she was dismissed from the service by this Court in
A.M. No. MTJ-92-751 in a resolution of May 30, 1994 and that she is waiving her
right to prosecute the case against respondent Peralta in A.M. No. MTJ-93-751.


On August 29,
1995, respondent Peralta filed a manifestation to withdraw A.M. No. P-93-801
for the reason that it raises the same issues as the unnumbered administrative
case filed with the Executive Judge of Naga City. 


On September 15,
1995, Judge Palaypayon filed his opposition to the motion to withdraw A.M. No.
P-93-801 arguing that:  (1) there is no
similarity of issue between A.M. No. P-93-801 and the unnumbered administrative
case,  (2) the Supreme Court does not
sanction any settlement of a case without first determining its merits and (3)  A.M. No. P-93-801 can be re-activated or
re-filed.  Additionally, Judge
Palaypayon sought the dismissal of A.M. No. MTJ-93-751  because:  (1) the complaint is not under oath;  (2) it involves the same issues and cause of action as A.M. No.
MTJ-95-1021 (Peralta, et. al. vs. Judge Palaypayon) which was resolved by
this  Court  on November 15, 1995; and  (3) forum-shopping.


Respondent
Peralta in turn filed a rejoinder to Judge Palaypayonâs opposition to his
motion to withdraw alleging that:  1) if
A.M. No. P-93-801 is re-activated, it will give respondent an opportunity to
comment and air his side;  (2) the fact
that A.M. No. MTJ-93-751 is not under oath, is not fatal;  (3)  the issues raised in A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021 are not the same as those in
A.M. No.  MTJ-93-751 as can be gleaned
from the allegations of the two complaints; and (4) forum-shopping or
multiplicity of suits may be waived when the Supreme Court deems it fit.


On January 16,
1996, Judge Palaypayon as respondent in A.M. No. MTJ-93-751 filed a
supplemental pleading to his original motion to dismiss alleging once more that
A.M. No. MTJ-93-751 and A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021 involve the same cause of action
and that the resolution of A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021 constitutes a bar to the
prosecution of A.M. No. MTJ-93-751.


On January 30,
1996, respondent Peralta filed his comment to the said supplemental pleading
alleging that the rule on 
res judicata
 cannot apply because the issues
in A.M. No.  MTJ-93-751 are different
from those in A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021.  He
claims that the order of contempt in A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021 arose from defamatory
utterances of  respondent Peralta on
July 9, 1993 while the order of contempt in A.M. No. MTJ-93-751 arose from the
refusal of  Peralta to act as
interpreter on November 18 and 19, 1993.  Respondent Peralta prayed that the motion to dismiss and its
supplemental pleading be dismissed.


Meanwhile on
January 25, 1996, complainant Judge Palaypayon filed a motion to waive his
right to prosecute A.M. No. P-93-801.  Respondent Peralta offered no objection thereto. 


Prescinding from
the foregoing antecedents, investigating judge made the following
recommendation, to wit:


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing
it is respectfully recommended that with respect to Adm. Matter No. MTJ-93-751
entitled Nelia B. Esmeralda-Baroy, complainant, vs. Edmundo B. Peralta,
respondent, it is respectfully recommended that the same be dismissed on the
ground that, as stated earlier, in a manifestation filed on August 9, 1995,
complainant Baroy has waived her right to prosecute this case and that she did
not appear anymore during the several scheduled investigation of this case
inspite of due notice.


With respect to Adm. Matter No. MTJ
No. 93-751 entitled Edmundo B. Peralta vs. Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr.,
while the motion to dismiss of Judge Palaypayon in Adm. Matter MTJ No. 93-751
entitled Edmundo B. Peralta, complainant vs. Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon Jr.,
respondent, be denied for lack of merit, the report and recommendation already
submitted by the undersigned in the aforementioned unnumbered Adm. Case be
adopted and to find respondent Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon Jr., to have acted
arbitrarily in sentencing complainant Edmundo Peralta an excessive penalty of
five (5) days.  Since this Honorable
Court had already found Judge Palaypayon in Adm. Matter No. MTJ-95-1021 to have
acted also arbitrarily in sentencing complainant Edmundo Peralta the excessive
penalty of five (5) days for direct contempt and admonishing respondent Judge
with a warning that repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealth (sic)
with more severely in the future, herein investigator respectfully submit and
left to this Honorable Court the proper penalty it may deem proper.


With respect to
Adm. Matter No. P-93-801, entitled Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr. vs. Edmundo
B. Peralta, it is respectfully recommended that the same be dismissed on the
ground that aside from the manifestation in open court by counsel for the
complainant Judge Palaypayon on November 17, 1995 that the latter is
withdrawing this case, Judge Palaypayon himself filed on January 25, 1996 a
âMotion to Waive My Right To Prosecute Adm. Matter No. 93-801â, alleging among
others that he discovered that all his charges in Adm. Matter No.
MTJ-93-801  were already included in the
unnumbered Adm. Case where the undersigned investigator had already submitted
his report recommendation.
[5]


The Court, in
its Resolution dated July 31, 1996, referred the cases to the Office of the
Court Administrator for evaluation, report and recommendation.


Said Office
submitted its Memorandum with the following findings which we reproduce
verbatim:


On the charge of gross
insubordination and refusal to obey order of superior, based on the evidence
presented by both parties, we find that the respondent did not really attend to
and perform his duty as such interpreter during the preliminary investigation
held on November 18, 1992 in Criminal Case No. 5752, People vs. San
Buenaventura, and on November 19, 1992 in Criminal Case No. 5764, People vs.
AcuÃ±a.  His refusal on the ground,
among others, that there was threats to his life and that complainant has a gun
kept under his drawer and that his request to divest complainant of his gun
first or that the preliminary investigation be conducted outside the chamber of
the complainant and that there is no order to interpret are not valid and
justifiable reasons for the respondent not to perform his duty.


That fear that respondent had in
mind that some untoward incident might happen to him inside the judge chambers
is merely speculative and unfounded.  As aptly observed by the Investigating Judge in his report and
recommendation, âit is most unlikely that the complainant who is a judge would
harm the respondent in the presence of the private complainant in the 2
criminal cases and their witnesses.  As
an interpreter, it was incumbent upon him to perform his duty and that there
was no need of an order directing him to interpret.â  (Report and Recommendation, p. 18).  As interpreter of the Court, he should realize that his
administrative function is just as essential to the prompt and proper
administration of justice.


On the other hand while respondent
had exhibited a clear and contumacious refusal to obey his superior, Judge
Palaypayon should have exercised proper restraint and decorum in dealing with
an otherwise stubborn personnel.  Due
process requires that he should at least ask his explanation why he refused to
perform his duty before citing him for contempt of court and ordering his
immediate arrest.  Moreover, granting
that respondent is guilty of direct contempt we consider as harsh and excessive
the penalty of 5 days imprisonment imposed by complainant on the person guilty
of direct contempt of court if it be declared by an inferior court should only
suffer one day imprisonment as prescribed by said rule.  While complainant has subsequently reduced
the penalty to one day after respondent spent 24 hours in jail, is not his
voluntary act but because of the pleadings made by other persons and out of
pity.


It is an oft-repeated rule that the
power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts so as to preserve order
in judicial proceedings and to uphold the due administration of justice.  Judges, however, should exercise their
contempt powers judiciously and sparingly, with utmost restraint, and with the
end in view of utilizing their contempt powers for correction and preservation
not for retaliation or vindication.  (A.M. No. RTJ-93-955, CastaÃ±os vs. Escano, Jr., resolution dated
December 12, 1995).  The power to
punish contempt should be exercised on the preventive and not on the vindictive
principle, on the corrective rather than the retaliatory idea of
punishment.  (Cantado vs. Tan, 160 SCRA
404).


With respect to the charge that on
July 9, 1993, respondent showed disrespect towards the complainant and uttered
defamatory words saying that complainant do not understand simple English, it
is noted that this fact is also the basis of the complaint in A.M. No.
MTJ-95-1021 where complainant Judge Palaypayon as respondent therein were
charged by Edmundo Peralta with gross ignorance of the law and grave abuse of
authority for citing the latter for direct contempt of court and sentencing him
with an excessive penalty of 5 days imprisonment.  The Court in the resolution dated November 15, 1995 admonished
therein respondent Judge with a warning that a repetition of the same or
similar acts in the future will be dealt with more severely.


As to whether such defamatory
statements can be a ground for disciplinary action in the present case, we
advert to the findings of the Investigating Judge Antonio Gerona, Vice
Executive Judge, RTC, Naga City in his report and recommendation that the
alleged defamatory words were uttered by respondent after office hours in the
afternoon and that the alleged defamatory utterance made would have been at
most an indirect contempt under Section 3 of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court as
it did not obstruct or interrupt any court proceedings, or the administration
of justice.  In the case of Nazareno
vs. Barnes, 136 SCRA 57, it was held that the remedy against an attack on a
judgeâs character and official performance of duty is not declaration of
contempt, but a criminal action for defamation (Report and Recommendation dated
January 15, 1994, p. 19).  In fact, a
case for grave oral defamation was already filed by herein complainant Judge
where respondent Peralta was convicted by RTC, Branch 25, Naga City on January
16, 1995 (A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021).


With respect to the charge that
respondentâs refusal to open the bodega where records and exhibits are being
kept, according to the findings of Judge Gerona there was no sufficient showing
that there was deliberate intent on the part of respondent to defy or disobey
the order of complainant to turn over the key to the Clerk of Court.  He attributed the delay to the following
reasons:  1) there was apprehension on
his part that the exhibits might get lost and the lost might be attributed to
him again as what happened to exhibits in Criminal Cases Nos. 5752 and 5764
when the truth is it was already turned over to the Judge and the Clerk of
Court; and 2) respondent sought first the advise of the Executive Judge Surtida
who advised him to see Deputy Court Administrator Reynaldo Suarez who in turn
advised him to comply with the order of the complainant.  In view of this, Judge Gerona recommended
the exoneration of the respondent on this charge.


In his report and recommendation
dated January 15, 1994 in the unnumbered Administrative Case, Judge Gerona made
the following recommendations:


1.
      
With
respect to the first and second charge, which are the alleged refusal of the
respondent to act as interpreter in Criminal Case No. 5752 on November 18, 1992
and Criminal Case No. 5764 on November 19, 1992, respondent be reprimanded for
neglect of duty;


2.
      
With
respect to the alleged uttering of defamatory statements, respondent be
exonerated, the sole testimony of complainant who actually did not hear the
alleged defamatory statements is not sufficient to find respondent guilty of
the charge and the persons who executed affidavits were not presented as
witnesses;


3
       
With
respect to the charge of alleged refusal to obey the order of complainant to
turn over the key to the bodega, respondent be exonerated.


We agree with the
recommendation of Judge Gerona with some modification.  With respect to the 4
th
 charge, respondent cannot be fully
exonerated.  The delay could have been
avoided if respondent had done something to erase his apprehension.  It is noted that at that time he is being
asked to turn over the key, he was already relieved of his duty as court
custodian, hence, he no longer had authority to remain in possession of the
key.  What respondent could have done
is to conduct a turn-over inventory of all the exhibits in his custody and have
it formally received by the Clerk of Court to avoid loss of exhibits.  Moreover, there was bad faith on his part
since he even sealed the bodega preventing therefor the retrieval of some
exhibits which could have prejudiced the litigants.


There are other charges in A.M. No.
MTJ-93-751 (Nelia Esmeralda-Baroy vs. Edmundo Peralta) which were not discussed
in the report and recommendation of Judge Gerona.  Same should be dismissed for insufficiency of evidence, not to
mention the failure of complainant Clerk of Court to prosecute her case.


For instance the charge of
Infidelity in the Custody of Documents was not sufficiently proven.  Records show that respondent Peralta had
already delivered the alleged missing exhibits in Criminal Case No. 5752, People
vs. Velasco, to Judge Palaypayon inside his chambers even before he was issued
the memorandum letter requiring him to submit the exhibits on October 27, 1992
and this fact was witnessed by Atty. Brioso, accused counsel, who executed an
affidavit to attest such fact.  On the
other hand, the exhibits in Criminal Case No. 5764 were actually sent by
respondent to the complainant Clerk of Court thru mail in view of the refusal
of said Clerk of Court to receive the same.  The proof of delivery of said exhibit is evidenced by the registry
receipt and the return card.  These
evidences were not successfully rebuted herein complainant(s).


As regards the charge of
Falsification and Irregularity in the accomplishment of DTRs,  the same should likewise be dismissed for
lack of material evidence.  It is noted
that all the questioned DTRs bear the signature of complainant  Clerk of Court hence there is the
presumption of regularity.  The mere
fact that said signatures were subsequently erased by herein complainant  Clerk of Court is not sufficient proof that
there was falsification made in the DTRs in the absence of any other evidence
such as testimony of witnesses who can attest to the fact that said respondent
was always late in reporting to office.


As to the charge of AWOL from
October 27, 1992 to November 17 1992 the same cannot prosper.  Record shows that respondent filed an
application for leave immediately when he reported back to office on November
18, 1992 which application however was disapproved by Judge Palaypayon for
reason that it was filed late.  He may
have filed late his application for leave but in this case there was no
intention to enjoy his leave of absence without official sanction which is the
essence of AWOL.  The respondent should
be reminded, however, that application for leave should be filed before the
taking of such leave.


As to the other
charges such as gallivanting, loitering, viewing betamax and sleeping at the
session hall during office hourse, etc. the same should likewise be dismissed
for want of evidence.
[6]


Consequently, it was recommended
that:


1
       
A.M.
No. MTJ-93-751 (Nelia Esmeralda-Baroy vs. Edmundo Peralta), the same should be
dismissed for failure of complainant to prosecute and lack of sufficient
evidence except with respect to the charge of Gross Insubordination and willful
disregard and refusal to obey court orders which was resolved together with the
Unnumbered Administrative Case.


2
       
A.M.
No. MTJ-93-751 (Peralta vs. Judge Palaypayon), Respondent Judge Palaypayon be
found guilty of grave abuse of authority for issuing contempt orders in a
vindictive manner and imposing a penalty of imprisonment in excess of what is
prescribed by Section 1, Rule 71, Revised Rules of Court and considering that
this is respondentâs second infraction where previously he was admonished by
this Court with warning that a repetition of the same will be severely dealt
with (A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021), respondent be imposed a penalty of FINE of
P5,000.00.


3
       
A.M.
No. P-93-801, the charges herein are identically the same with the Unnumbered
Administrative Case, hence this case be taken together with the Unnumbered
Administrative Case.


4
      
Unnumbered Administrative Case, (Judge
Palaypayon vs. Peralta), respondent Peralta be found guilty of gross
dereliction of duty for his willful refusal to perform his duty to interpret on
two occasions without justifiable reason and for his willful refusal to turn
over the key to the bodega where the exhibits are kept even after he was
relieved of his duty as custodian of exhibits, respondent be SUSPENDED from
office for one month with warning that a repetition of the same in the future
will be dealt with severely by this Court.
[7]


The Court agrees
with the findings and recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator
that Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr. and Court Interpreter Edmundo P.
Peralta  are indeed guilty of grave
abuse of authority and gross dereliction of duty, respectively.


It must,
however, be stressed that the twin waivers of complainants Nelia B.
Esmeralda-Baroy and Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon of their right to prosecute A.M.
No. MTJ-93-751 and A.M. No. P-93-801, respectively, against Edmundo  B. Peralta do not constitute dismissal of
the said complaints.  These cases should
instead be taken together with the other two (2) cases, A.M. No. MTJ-93-751 and
the unnumbered administrative case, likewise subject of the present
controversy.  We have  consistently held that a complaint for
misconduct, malfeasance or misfeasance against a public servant, be they
officials or mere employees, cannot be withdrawn at any time for whatever
reason by a complainant as this is anathema to the preservation of the faith
and confidence of the citizenry in their government, its agencies and
instrumentalities.  Verily, proceedings
in such cases should not be made to depend on the whims and caprices of the
complainants who are in a real  sense,
only  witnesses therein. 
[8]


Anent the charge
of grave abuse of authority against Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr. for
sentencing Edmundo B. Peralta to suffer five (5) days imprisonment for direct
contempt of court, we find the said punishment arbitrary and excessive.  Under Section 1, Rule 71 of the Rules of
Court, a person guilty of misbehavior in the presence of, or so near an
inferior court or judge as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before the
same, including disrespect toward the court or judge, offensive personalities
towards  others may be summarily
adjudged in contempt by such court or judge and punished by fine not exceeding
ten pesos (P10.00) or imprisonment not exceeding one (1) day or both.


It is
well-settled that the power to punish a person in contempt of court is inherent
in all courts so as to preserve order in judicial proceedings and to uphold the
due administration of justice.
[9]
 Judges, however, are enjoined to
exercise such power judiciously and sparingly, with utmost restraint, and with
the end view of utilizing the same for correction and preservation of the
dignity of the court, and not for retaliation or vindication.


Records show
that respondent judge was previously admonished by this Court for the same
infraction against the same complainant in A.M. No. MTJ-95-1021 with a warning
that a repetition of the same act will be dealt with more severely.
[10]
 Accordingly, respondent judge is
sentenced to pay a fine of  P2,000.00.


The findings and
recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator with respect to the
complaints against respondent Edmundo B. Peralta are adopted in their entirety
save for the penalty imposed which we find too severe.  Consequently, respondent Peralta  is suspended from office for a period
of  fifteen (15) days.  


WHEREFORE, 
premises considered, the Court
hereby rules as follows:


In A.M. No.
MTJ-93-751 entitled Edmundo B. Peralta v. Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon, Jr.,  respondent judge is found guilty of grave
abuse of authority and is accordingly sentenced to pay a 
FINE
 of P2,000
with warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future will
be dealt with more severely;


In A.M. No.
MTJ-93-751 entitled Nelia Esmeralda-Baroy v. Edmundo B. Peralta, A.M. No.
P-93-801 and the unnumbered administrative case, both entitled Judge Lucio P.
Palaypayon, Jr. v. Edmundo B. Peralta, respondent Edmundo B. Peralta is found
guilty of gross dereliction of duty and is hereby 
SUSPENDED 
from office
for a period of fifteen (15) days effective immediately with warning that a
repetition of the same or similar acts in the future will be dealt with more
severely.
