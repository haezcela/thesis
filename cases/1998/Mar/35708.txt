SUNGA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND
FERDINAND B. TRINIDAD, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


This petition
for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeks
to annul and set aside, for having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, the 17 May 1996 Resolution of the
COMELEC 2nd Division in  
 
Sunga  v.  Trinidad,  SPA  No.  95-213,
[1]
 dismissing  the  petition  for disqualification
against private respondent Ferdinand B. Trinidad pursuant to COMELEC Resolution
No. 2050 promulgated 3 November 1988, as amended by COMELEC Resolution No.
2050-A promulgated 8 August 1990, and 30 July 1996 Resolution of the COMELEC En
Banc affirming the 17 May 1996 Resolution of the COMELEC 2nd Division. 


Petitioner
Manuel C. Sunga was one of the candidates for the position of Mayor in the
Municipality of Iguig, Province of Cagayan, in the 8
 
May 1995
elections.  Private respondent Ferdinand
B. Trinidad, then incumbent mayor, was a candidate for re-election in the same
municipality.  


On 22 April 1995
Sunga filed with the COMELEC a letter-complaint
[2]
 for disqualification against
Trinidad, accusing him of using three (3) local government vehicles in his
campaign, in violation of Sec. 261, par. (o), Art. XXII, of BP Blg. 881
(Omnibus Election Code, as amended).  On
7 May 1995, Sunga filed another letter-complaint
[3]
 with the COMELEC charging Trinidad
this time with violation of Sec. 261, par.  (e) (referring to threats, intimidation, terrorism or other forms of
coercion) of the Omnibus Election Code, in addition to the earlier violation
imputed to him in the first letter-complaint.  This was followed by an Amended Petition
[4]
 for disqualification consolidating
the charges in the two  (2)
letters-complaint, including vote buying,  and providing more specific details of the violations committed by
Trinidad.  The case was docketed as SPA
No. 95-213. 


In a Minute
Resolution dated 25 May 1995,
[5]
 the COMELEC 2nd Division referred
the complaint to its Law Department for investigation.  Hearings were held wherein Sunga adduced
evidence to prove his accusations.  Trinidad, on the other hand, opted not to submit any evidence at all. 


Meanwhile, the
election results showed that Trinidad garnered the highest number of votes,
while Sunga trailed second.  


On 10 May 1995
Sunga moved for the suspension of the proclamation of Trinidad.  However, notwithstanding the motion,
Trinidad was proclaimed the elected mayor, prompting Sunga to file another
motion to suspend the effects
 
of the proclamation.  Both motions were not acted upon by the
COMELEC 2nd Division. 


On 28 June 1995
the COMELEC Law Department submitted its Report
[6]
 to the COMELEC En Banc  recommending that Trinidad be charged in
court for violation of the following penal provisions  of the Omnibus Election Code:  (a) Sec. 261, par. (a), on vote buying; (b) Sec. 261, par. (e), on
threats, intimidation, terrorism or other forms of coercion; and, (c) Sec. 261,
par. (o), on use of any equipment, vehicle owned by the government or any of
its political subdivisions.  The Law
Department likewise recommended to recall and revoke the proclamation of
Ferdinand B. Trinidad as the duly elected Mayor of Iguig, Cagayan; proclaim
Manuel C. Sunga  as the duly elected
Mayor; and, direct Sunga to take his oath and assume the duties and functions
of  the office. 


The COMELEC En
Banc  approved the findings of the Law
Department and directed the filing of the corresponding informations  in the Regional Trial Court against
Trinidad.  Accordingly, four (4)
informations
[7]
 for various elections offenses were
filed in the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao, Cagayan.  The disqualification case, on the other
hand, was referred to the COMELEC 2nd Division for hearing. 


On 2 May 1996
Sunga filed a Second Urgent Motion to Suspend the Effects and Annul the
Proclamation with Urgent Motion for Early Resolution of the Petition.  But in its 17 May 1996 Resolution, the
COMELEC 2nd Division dismissed the petition for disqualification, holding in
its Resolution No. 2050 that â  


1. Any complaint for
disqualification of a duly registered candidate based upon any of the grounds
specifically enumerated under Sec. 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, filed
directly with the Commission before an election in which respondent is a
candidate, shall be inquired into by the Commission for the purpose of
determining  whether the acts complained
of have in fact been committed  x x x x 


In case such complaint was not
resolved before the election, the Commission may 
motu propio
, or on
motion of any of the parties, refer the complaint to the Law Department of the
Commission as the instrument of the latter in the  exercise of its exclusive power to conduct a preliminary
investigation of all cases involving criminal infractions of the election laws
x x x x 


2. Any complaint for
disqualification based on Sec. 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to
Sec. 6 of Republic Act No. 6646 filed after the election against a candidate
who has already been proclaimed as a winner shall be dismissed as a
disqualification case.  However, the
complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Department
of this Commission. 


Where a similar complaint is filed
after election but before proclamation of the respondent candidate, the
complaint shall, nevertheless, be dismissed as a disqualification case.  However, the complaint shall be referred for
preliminary investigation to the Law Department.  If, before proclamation, the Law Department makes a 
prima
facie
  finding of guilt and the
corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the
complainant  may file a petition for
suspension of the proclamation of the respondent with the court before which
the criminal case is pending and said court may order the suspension of the
proclamation if the evidence of guilt is strong. 


As interpreted in the case of 
Silvestre
v. Duavit,
  SPA 94-003, Resolution
No. 2050 provides for the outright dismissal of the disqualification case in
three cases:  (1) The disqualification
case was filed before the election but remains unresolved until after the
election;  (2) The disqualification case
was filed after the election and before the  proclamation of winners; and (3) The disqualification case was filed
after election and after proclamation.


If the instant case is deemed to
have been filed upon receipt by the COMELEC of the letter-complaint on April 26
1995, it nevertheless remained pending until after the election.  If it is deemed to have been filed upon
filing of the amended petition on 11 May 1995, it was clearly filed after the
election.  In either case, Resolution
No. 2050 mandates the dismissal of the disqualification case. 


His motion for
reconsideration having been denied by the COMELEC En Banc, Sunga filed the
instant petition contending that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of
discretion in dismissing the petition for disqualification in that: first
,
  Sec. 6 of RA No. 6646 requires the COMELEC
to resolve the disqualification case even after the election and proclamation,
and the proclamation and assumption of office by Trinidad did not deprive the
COMELEC of its jurisdiction;  second,
COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 is null and void as it contravenes Sec. 6 of R.A.
No. 6646; third, the fact that COMELEC authorized the filing of four (4)
informations against private respondent for violation of the penal provisions
of the Omnibus Election Code shows more than sufficient and substantial
evidence to disqualify Trinidad, and he should have been so disqualified; and
fourth, since Trinidad was a disqualified candidate, it is as if petitioner was
the only candidate entitled to be proclaimed as the duly elected mayor. 


In his 17-page
Comment and Manifestation  dated 3
December 1996, the Solicitor General concurred with petitionerâs arguments.


Private
respondent, on the other hand, postulates 
inter alia
 that Sungaâs
letters-complaint of 22 April 1995 and 7 May 1995 were not petitions for
disqualification because no filing fee was paid by Sunga; the letters-complaint
were never docketed by the COMELEC;  and, no summons was ever issued by the COMELEC and private respondent
was not required to answer the letters-complaint.  It was only on 13 May 1995 when petitioner filed the so-called
Amended Petition, docketed for the first time as SPA No. 95-213.  Thus, the COMELEC correctly dismissed the
disqualification case for having been filed only after the 8 May 1995 elections
and the proclamation of private respondent on 10 May 1995, pursuant to COMELEC
Resolution No. 2050.


COMELEC filed
its Comment  on 21 April 1997 relying
heavily on Resolution No. 2050 and the Silvestre v. Duavit
[8]
 ruling in support of the dismissal
of the disqualification case.  The
COMELEC insisted that the outright dismissal of a disqualification case was
warranted under any of the following circumstances:  (a) the disqualification case was filed before the election but
was still pending (unresolved) after  the election;  (b) the
disqualification case was filed after the election but before the proclamation
of the winner; and, (c) the disqualification case was filed after the election
and after the proclamation of the winner. 


The issue in
this case is whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion when it
dismissed the disqualification case against private respondent Trinidad. 


The petition is
partly meritorious.


We find private
respondentâs arguments on the propriety of the letters-complaint puerile.  COMELEC itself impliedly recognized in its
Resolution that the petition was filed before the 8 May 1995 election in the
form of letters-complaint, thus â 


This case originally came to the
attention of this Commission on 26 April 1995 in a form of letter from
petitioner accusing respondent of utilizing government properties in his
campaign and praying for the latterâs immediate disqualification.  Another letter dated 7 May 1995 and
addressed to the COMELEC Regional Director of Region II reiterated petitionerâs
prayer while alleging that respondent and his men committed acts of terrorism
and violated the gun ban.  Finally, on
11 May 1995, an Amended Petition was filed with the Clerk of Court of the
Commission containing substantially the same allegations as the previous
letters but supported by affidavits and other documentary evidence. 


That the Amended
Petition was filed only on 11 May 1995, or after the elections, is of no
consequence.  It was merely a
reiteration of the charges filed by petitioner against private respondent on 26
April 1995 and 7 May 1995 or before the elections.  Consequently, the Amended Petition retroacted to such earlier
dates.  An amendment which merely
supplements and amplifies facts originally alleged in the complaint relates
back to the date of the commencement of the action and is not barred by the
statute of limitations which expired after the service of the original
complaint.
[9]


The fact that no
docket fee was paid therefor was not a fatal procedural lapse on the part of
petitioner.  Sec. 18, Rule 42, of the
COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides,  âIf the fees above described are not paid, the Commission may refuse to
take action thereon until they are paid and may dismiss the action or
proceeding.â  The use of the word âmayâ
indicates that it is permissive only and operates to confer a discretion on the
COMELEC whether to entertain the petition or not in case of non-payment of
legal fees.  That the COMELEC acted on
and did not dismiss the petition outright shows that the non-payment of fees
was not considered by it as a legal obstacle to entertaining the same.  Be that as it may, the procedural defects
have been cured by the subsequent payment of docket fees, and private
respondent was served with summons, albeit belatedly, and he submitted his answer
to the complaint.  Hence, private
respondent has no cause to complain that no docket fee was paid, no summons
served upon him, or that he was not required to answer.


Neither do we
agree with the conclusions of the COMELEC.  We discern nothing in COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 declaring, ordering or
directing the dismissal of a disqualification case filed before the election
but which remained unresolved after the election.  What the Resolution mandates in such a case is for the Commission
to refer the complaint to its Law Department for investigation to determine
whether the acts complained of have in fact been committed by the candidate
sought to be disqualified.  The findings
of the Law Department then become the basis for disqualifying the erring
candidate.  This is totally different
from the other two situations contemplated by Resolution No. 2050, i.e., a
disqualification case filed after the election but before the proclamation of
winners and that filed after the election and the proclamation of winners,
wherein it was specifically directed by the same Resolution to be dismissed as
a disqualification case. 


Moreover,
Resolution No. 2050 as interpreted in Silvestre v. Duavit  infringes on Sec. 6 of RA No. 6646,
[10]
 which provides:


SEC. 6. 
Effects of Disqualification
Case. -
  Any candidate who has been
declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the
votes cast for him shall not be counted.  If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before
an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and  receives the winning number of votes in such
election, the Court or Commission 
shall continue with the trial and hearing
of the action, inquiry or protest
  and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the
pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate
whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong 
(underscoring supplied).


Clearly, the
legislative intent is that the COMELEC should continue the trial and hearing of
the disqualification case to its conclusion, i.e., until judgment is rendered
thereon.  The word âshallâ signifies
that this requirement of the law is mandatory, operating to impose a positive
duty which must be enforced.
[11]
 The implication is that the COMELEC
is left with no discretion but to proceed with the disqualification case even
after the election.  Thus, in providing
for the outright dismissal of the disqualification case which remains
unresolved after the election, Silvestre v. Duavit  in effect disallows what RA No. 6646 imperatively requires.  This amounts to a quasi-judicial legislation
by the COMELEC which cannot be countenanced and is invalid for having been
issued beyond the scope of its authority.  Interpretative rulings of quasi-judicial bodies or administrative
agencies must always be in perfect harmony with statutes and should be for the
sole purpose of carrying their general provisions into effect.  By such interpretative or administrative
rulings, of course, the scope of the law itself cannot be limited.  Indeed, a quasi-judicial body or an
administrative agency for that matter cannot amend an act of Congress.  Hence, in case of a discrepancy between the
basic law and an interpretative or administrative ruling, the basic law
prevails.


Besides, the
deleterious effect of the Silvestre ruling is not difficult to foresee.  A candidate  guilty  of  election  offenses  would  be undeservedly rewarded, instead of
punished, by the dismissal of the disqualification case against him simply
because the investigating body was unable, for any reason caused upon it, to
determine before the election if the offenses were indeed committed by the
candidate sought to be disqualified.  All that the erring aspirant would need to do is to employ delaying
tactics so that the disqualification case based on the commission of election
offenses would not be decided before the election.  This scenario is productive of more fraud which certainly is not
the main intent and purpose of the law.


The fact that
Trinidad was already proclaimed and had assumed the position of mayor did not
divest the COMELEC of authority and jurisdiction to continue the hearing and
eventually decide the disqualification case.  In Aguam v. COMELEC
[12]
 this Court held - 


Time and again this Court has given
its 
imprimatur
 on the principle that COMELEC is with authority to annul
any canvass and proclamation which was illegally made.  The fact that a candidate proclaimed has
assumed office, we have said, is no bar to the exercise of such power.  It of course may not be availed of where
there has been a valid proclamation.  Since private respondentâs petition before the COMELEC is precisely
directed at the annulment of the canvass and proclamation, we perceive that inquiry
into this issue is within the area allocated by the Constitution and law to
COMELEC x x x x Really, were a victim of a proclamation to be precluded from
challenging the validity thereof after that proclamation and the assumption of
office thereunder, baneful effects may easily supervene.


It must be
emphasized that the purpose of a disqualification proceeding is to prevent the
candidate from running or, if elected,  from serving, or to prosecute him for violation of the election laws.
Obviously,  the  fact  that a  candidate  has been proclaimed elected does not signify
that his disqualification is deemed condoned and may no longer be the subject
of a separate investigation. 


It is worth to
note that an election offense has criminal as well as electoral aspects.  Its criminal aspect involves the
ascertainment of the guilt or innocence of the accused candidate.  Like in any other criminal case, it usually
entails a full-blown hearing and the quantum of proof required to secure a
conviction is beyond reasonable doubt.  Its electoral aspect, on the other hand, is a determination of whether
the offender should be disqualified from office.  This is done through an administrative proceeding which is
summary in character and requires only a clear preponderance of evidence.  Thus, under Sec. 4 of the COMELEC Rules of
Procedure, petitions for disqualification "shall be heard summarily after
due notice."  It is the electoral
aspect that we are more concerned with, under which an erring candidate may be
disqualified even without prior criminal conviction.
[13]


It is quite
puzzling that the COMELEC never acted on Sungaâs motion to suspend the
proclamation of Trinidad.  The last
sentence of Sec. 6 of RA No. 6646 categorically declares that the Commission
may order the suspension of the proclamation of a candidate sought to be
disqualified whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong.  And there is not a scintilla of doubt that
the evidence of Trinidadâs guilt was strong as shown in the 
Report and
Recommendation
  of the COMELEC Law
Department â 


Parenthetically, there is merit to
petitionerâs petition against the respondent for disqualification for the
alleged commission of election offenses under Sec. 68 of the Omnibus Election
Code, such as use of armed men and act of terrorism, intimidation and coercion
of voters, massive vote-buying and others, duly supported by affidavits of
witnesses and other documents.  Consequently, the petitionerâs evidence supporting the disqualification
of respondent remain unrebutted simply because respondent has expressly waived
his right to present evidence in SPA No. 95-213 in his Manifestation and
objection to the presentation of evidence in SPA No. 95-213 dated 16 June 1995,
thus the waiver is the intentional relinquishing of a known right of respondent
TRINIDAD.


In fact, on the
basis of this 
Report and Recommendation
  the COMELEC directed the filing of four (4) criminal informations
against Trinidad before the Regional Trial Court, an indication that there was
indeed 
prima facie
 evidence of violation of election laws.


However, Sungaâs
contention that he is entitled to be proclaimed as the duly elected Mayor of
the Municipality of Iguig, Province of Cagayan, in the event that Trinidad is
disqualified finds no support in law and jurisprudence.  The fact that the candidate who obtained
the highest number of votes is later disqualified for the office to which he
was  elected does  not  entitle the candidate  who  obtained  the  second highest number of
votes to be declared the winner of the elective office. The votes cast for a
disqualified person may not be valid to install the winner into office or  maintain  him  there.  But  in  the  absence  of  a statute which clearly asserts a contrary
political and legislative policy on the matter, if the votes were cast in the
sincere belief that the candidate was qualified, they should not be treated as
stray, void or meaningless.
[14]
 


Sunga totally
miscontrued the nature of our democratic electoral process as well as the
sociological and psychological elements behind votersâ preferences.  Election is the process  of  complete  ascertainment of the
expression of the popular will.  Its
ultimate purpose is to give effect to the will of the electorate by giving them
direct participation in choosing the men and women who will run their
government.  Thus, it would be
extremely repugnant to the basic concept of the constitutionally guaranteed
right to suffrage if a candidate who has not acquired the majority or plurality
of votes is proclaimed winner and imposed as the representative of a
constituency, the majority of whom have positively declared through their
ballots that they do not choose him.
[15]
 


While Sunga may
have garnered the second highest number of votes, the fact remains that he was
not the choice of the people of Iguig, Cagayan.  âThe wreath of victory cannot be transferred from the
disqualified winner to the repudiated loser because the law then as now
only  authorizes  a declaration  of election  in  favor  of the person who has obtained a plurality of votes and does not entitle
a candidate receiving the next highest number of votes to be declared elected.â
[16]
 In 
Aquino v. COMELEC,
[17]
 
this Court made the following pronouncement: 


To simplistically assume that the
second placer would have received the other votes would be to substitute our
judgment for the mind of the voter.  The second placer is just that, a second placer.  He lost the elections.  He was repudiated by either a majority or
plurality of voters.  He could not be
considered the first among qualified candidates because in a field which
excludes the disqualified candidate, the conditions would have substantially
changed.  We are not prepared to
extrapolate the results under such circumstances. 


Also, what Sunga
wants us to do is to disregard the express mandate of Sec. 44, RA No. 7160,
[18]
 which provides in part - 


Sec. 44.  
Permanent vacancies in the office of the Governor,
Vice-Governor, Mayor, Vice-Mayor.  -
  (a) If a permanent vacancy occurs in the
office of the Governor or 
Mayor
, the Vice-Governor or 
Vice-Mayor
  concerned 
shall become
  the Governor or 
Mayor
  x x x x 


For purposes of this chapter, a
permanent vacancy arises when an elective local official fills a higher vacant
office, refuses to assume office, 
fails to qualify
,  dies, is removed from office, voluntarily
resigns or is otherwise permanently incapacitated to discharge the functions of
his office  x x x x


This provision is echoed in Art. 83 of the 
Implementing Rules and
Regulations of the Local Government Code of 1991.
 


The language of
the law is clear, explicit and unequivocal, thus admits no room for
interpretation  but merely
application.  This is the basic legal
precept.  Accordingly, in the event that
Trinidad is adjudged to be disqualified, a permanent vacancy will be created
for failure of the elected mayor to qualify for the said office.  In such eventuality, the duly elected
vice-mayor shall succeed as provided by law.
[19]
 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is PARTIALLY
GRANTED.  The 17 May 1996 and 30 July
1996 Resolutions of the COMELEC are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.  COMELEC is ordered to REINSTATE SPA No.
