AND SPOUSES ANGEL L. BAUTISTA AND ANGELICA M. BAUTISTA, PETITIONERS, VS.
ALFARO FORTUNADO, EDITHA FORTUNADO, & NESTOR FORTUNADO, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


This petition
for review on 
certiorari
 seeks to nullify the Order
[1]
 dated January 24,1986 of the
Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Norte, Branch V, in Civil Case No. 262, which
reversed its earlier Decision
[2]
 dated July 31,1985 dismissing the
complaint filed by respondents. 


The facts are
not disputed:


Respondents
Alfaro, Editha and Nestor, all surnamed  Fortunado, are the registered  owners of  two  parcels of  land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title  No. T-3041 and T-1929, both  registered  with  the Register of Deeds of Iligan City.  Said properties were mortgaged by Arsenio
Lopez, Jr. on July 24,1968 to the Traders Commercial Bank (now Traders Royal
Bank) to secure a loan obligation in the amount of 
P
 370,000.00.


On January 6,
1971, respondents instituted an action before the then Court of First Instance
of Rizal, Branch XVIII, against Arsenio Lopez, Jr. and Traders Royal Bank,
among others, for annulment of mortgage.  In said complaint, Traders Royal Bank  interposed a counterclaim for foreclosure of the mortgage. 


On August
24,1973, the trial court rendered a decision
[3]
, the dispositive portion of which
reads:


"WHEREFORE, the Court
renders judgment: 


I.  As Regards the Plaintiff's Complaint:  


1. Ordering the defendant
Mariano Pascual to pay to the plaintiffs the amount of 
P
24,550.00 plus
legal interest from the filing of the complaint until fully paid and attorney's
fees in the amount of 
P
2,000.00 and to pay the costs.


2. Ordering the deed of
real estate mortgage which  is attached
as Annex 'B' of the complaint to be declared null and void and, ordering the
Register of Deeds of Iligan City to cancel the said mortgage at the back of TCT
No. T-1929, Book I, Page 8 and TCT No. T-3040, Book I, Page 96 of said Register
of Deeds.


II.  With Respect to the Cross-Claim and the Third-Party Complaint of
Defendant Traders Commercial Bank:


1. Ordering  the spouses Arsenio Lopez, Jr. and Ofelia
Lopez to pay the Traders Commercial Bank jointly and severally the amount of 
P
578,025.23,
inclusive of interest and other bank charges as of April 30,1971, and,
thereafter, plus all interest and bank charges until full payment is made and,
to pay to the bank the amount of 
P
20,000.00 as attorney's fees and the
costs. 


The bank 's counterclaim against
the plaintiffs is hereby dismissed.


Likewise, the counterclaim of
Mariano Pascual against the plaintiffs is also dismissed.


SO
ORDERED."


On appeal, the
Court of Appeals modified the trial court's decision, in this manner:


"WHEREFORE, the
decision appealed from is hereby modified by eliminating paragraph 2 of the
dispositive portion of the decision of the lower court declaring the real
estate mortgage in favor of the Traders Commercial Bank null and void.  The decision is affirmed in all other respects."
[4]


On December 28,
1983, Traders Royal Bank assigned
[5]
 its rights to the mortgage to
petitioner Angel L. Bautista. By virtue of the said assignment, petitioner on
March 19,1984 wrote the City Sheriff of Iligan City requesting that the
mortgaged properties be foreclosed for non-payment of the loan obligation. To
thwart the pending foreclosure,  respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Norte,
Branch V, a complaint for cancellation of lien with preliminary injunction  against petitioner, which was docketed as
Civil Case No. 262.


After petitioner
filed his answer, respondents moved for a summary judgment which was granted by
the court. Consequently, on July 31,1985, the trial court rendered judgment
dismissing the complaint.  In its
decision, the trial court delved on the issue of prescription of a mortgage
action.


Respondents
moved for reconsideration arguing that since the principal loan has already
been paid, the mortgage, which is an accessory contract, should likewise be
extinguished. 


On January 24,
1986, the trial court modified its earlier decision disposing thus:


"WHEREFORE,  the motion for reconsideration, as amended,
of the summary judgment of July 31,1985 is hereby reconsidered and modified to
read:


'Premises considered, the
Court finds that the plaintiffs have made out a preponderating case against the
defendants.'


And as
prayed for in the complaint, the temporary restraining order of the Court in
the case on April 23,1984 is hereby converted into a preliminary injunction and
by these presents made permanent. The City Sheriff  of Iligan City,  Mr. Angel
L. Bautista and Mrs. Angelica M. Bautista are hereby permanently restrained
from conducting a public auction sale of the property covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-3041 (a.f.).  The Register of Deeds of Iligan City is hereby further ordered to cancel
Entry No. 451 on Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-3041 (a.f.) on file with
his office.  No pronouncement as to
damages or attorney's fees.


âWith
costs against the defendants.


  âSO ORDERED."


Petitioner
appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a Resolution
[6]
 on August 28,1987, forwarding the
case to this Court for resolution reading thus:


"Considering that
opposing counsel left the resolution of Atty. Ramon Gonzales' motion to the
sound discretion of this Court and considering the unrefuted allegation of the
said motion that there were no documentary  or testimonial evidence which were the basis of the questioned decision
but mere admissions of the parties, the questions raised on appeal become mere
questions of law, over which the Supreme Court has exclusive original
jurisdiction."


On December
29,1987, petitioner filed this present petition for review contending that the
trial court erred in modifying its earlier decision; in declaring that  he has  no right to  foreclose the  mortgaged  property;  in declaring  the  temporary restraining order into a permanent preliminary injunction and
in ordering the Register of Deeds of Iligan City to cancel entry No. 451 on TCT
No. 3041.


We gave due
course to the petition and required the contending parties to submit their
respective Memoranda on August 31,1988.  


On January 30,
1995, respondents, through counsel Ramon A. Gonzales, filed a verified
Manifestation informing the Court that the subject real estate mortgage has
already been released by the Traders Royal Bank on December 22, 1983 as  shown  in the  certified true copy of
the Release of Real Estate Mortgage,
[7]
 and that the petitioner was killed
in a robbery in his house.
[8]
 Respondents therefore pray for the
dismissal of the petition .


On February 20,
1995, this Court  required petitioner's
counsel Atty. Emilio Abrogena to comment on  the said Manifestation.  However,
the copy of the resolution of the Court addressed to Atty. Abrogena was
returned unclaimed after three notices,
[9]
 with the postmaster's remark
"moved."  In view of this
development, the Court considered the resolution as served.
[10]


Acting on the
Manifestation of the respondents, we resolve to dismiss the petition for having
been rendered moot and academic.


The resolution
of the basic issue of whether or not the petitioner has the  right to extra-judicially foreclose the
mortgage is no longer necessary in view of the release of the mortgage as shown
in the certified true copy thereof.  No
useful purpose would be served by passing on the merits of the petition.  Any ruling in this case could hardly be of
any practical or useful purpose in the premises.  It is a well-settled rule that courts will not determine a moot
question or abstract proposition nor express an opinion in a case in which no
practical relief can be granted.
[11]


However, we take
notice of the failure of petitioner's lawyer, Atty. Emilio Abrogena,  to inform the trial court of the death of
petitioner, a duty mandated by Section 16, Rule 3 of the  Revised Rules of Court.  which provides in part, to wit:


"SEC. 16. 
Death of
party; duty of counsel.
- Whenever a party to a pending action dies, and the
claim is not thereby extinguished, it shall be the
 
duty of his counsel
to inform the court within thirty (30) days after such death of the fact
thereof, and to give the name and address of his legal representative or
representatives. Failure of the counsel to comply with this duty shall be a
ground for disciplinary action.


x x x
                        
x x x
                            
x
x x.â


Hence, the
proper substitution of the deceased  in
accordance with the aforequoted provisions of Rule 3 could not be effected.


We likewise note
Atty. Abrogena's failure to inform this Court of his change of address which
accounts for his failure to comment on the manifestation of respondents
relative to the death of petitioner and the release of the subject real estate
mortgage. 


Atty. Abrogena
should bear in mind that a lawyer is, first and foremost, an officer of the
court.  His duties to the court are more
significant than those which he owes to his client.  His first duty is not to his client but to the administration of
justice; to that end, his client's success is wholly subordinate; and his conduct
ought  to and must always be scrupulously
observant of the law and ethics of the profession.
[12]
 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby DISMISSED
for being moot and academic.  Atty.
Emilio Abrogena,  counsel for  petitioner, is hereby REPRIMANDED for his
failure to inform this Court of the death of petitioner and  to  perform his duty under Section 16, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of
Court.  He is further warned that a
repetition of  such omission  in the future will be dealt with severely.
