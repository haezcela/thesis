CELSO R. HALILI AND ARTHUR
R. HALILI, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, HELEN MEYERS GUZMAN, DAVID
REY GUZMAN AND EMILIANO CATANIAG, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The factual
findings of a trial court, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, may no longer
be reviewed and reversed by this Court in a petition for review under Rule 45
of the Rules of Court.  The transfer of
an interest in a piece of land to an alien may no longer be assailed on
constitutional grounds after the entire parcel has been sold to a qualified
citizen.


The Case


These familiar
and long-settled doctrines are applied by this Court in denying this petition
under Rule 45 to set aside the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 in CA-GR CV No. 37829 promulgated
on September 14, 1993, the dispositive portion of which states:
[3]


âWHEREFORE, and upon all the
foregoing, the Decision of the court below dated March 10, 1992 dismissing the
complaint for lack of merit is AFFIRMED without pronouncement as to costs.â


The Facts


The factual
antecedents, as narrated by Respondent Court, are not disputed by the
parties.  We reproduce them in part, as
follows:


âSimeon de Guzman, an American citizen, died sometime
in 1968, leaving real properties in the Philippines.  His forced heirs were his widow, defendant appellee [herein
private respondent] Helen Meyers Guzman, and his son, defendant appellee [also
herein private respondent] David Rey Guzman, both of whom are also American citizens.  On August 9, 1989, Helen executed a deed of
quitclaim (Annex A-Complaint), assigning[,] transferring and conveying to David
Rey all her rights, titles and interests in and over six parcels of land which
the two of them inherited from Simeon.


Among the said parcels of land is that now in
litigation,  x x x  situated in Bagbaguin, Sta. Maria, Bulacan,
containing an area of 6,695 square meters, covered by Transfer Certificate of
Title No. T-170514 of the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan.  The quitclaim having been registered, TCT
No. T-170514 was cancelled and TCT No. T-120259 was issued in the name of
appellee David Rey Guzman.


On February 5, 1991, David Rey
Guzman sold said parcel of land to defendant-appellee [also herein private
respondent] Emiliano Cataniag, upon which TCT No. T-120259 was cancelled and
TCT No. T-130721(M) was issued in the latterâs name.â
[4]


Petitioners, who
are owners of the adjoining lot, filed a complaint before the Regional Trial
Court of Malolos, Bulacan, questioning the constitutionality and validity of
the two conveyances -- between Helen Guzman and David Rey Guzman, and between
the latter and Emiliano Cataniag -- and claiming ownership thereto based on
their right of legal redemption under Art. 1621
[5]
of the Civil Code.


In its decision
[6]
 dated March 10, 1992,
[7]
 the trial court dismissed the
complaint.  It ruled that Helen Guzmanâs
waiver of her inheritance in favor of her son was not contrary to the
constitutional prohibition against the sale of land to an alien, since the
purpose of the waiver was simply to authorize David Rey Guzman to dispose of
their properties in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the
Philippines, and not to subvert them.  On the second issue, it held that the subject land was urban; hence,
petitioners had no reason to invoke their right of redemption under Art. 1621
of the Civil Code.


The Halilis
sought a reversal from the Court of Appeals which, however, denied their
appeal.  Respondent Court affirmed the
factual finding of the trial court that the subject land was urban.  Citing 
Tejido vs. Zamacoma
[8]
 
and
 Yap vs. Grageda,
[9]
 it further held that, although the
transfer of the land to David Rey may have been invalid for being contrary to
the Constitution, there was no more point in allowing herein petitioners to
recover the property, since it has passed on to and was thus already owned by a
qualified person.


Hence, this
petition.
[10]


Issues


The petition
submits the following assignment of errors:


âx x x  the Honorable Court of Appeals -


1.  Erred in affirming the conclusion of the trial court that the land in
question is urban, not rural


2.  Erred in denying petitionersâ right of redemption under Art. 1621 of the
Civil Code


3.  Having considered the conveyance from Helen Meyers Guzman to her son
David Rey Guzman illegal, erred in not declaring the same null and void[.]â
[11]


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition has
no merit.


First Issue: 
  The Land Is Urban;


Thus, No Right of Redemption


The first two
errors assigned by petitioners being interrelated -- the determination of the
first being a prerequisite to the resolution of the second -- shall be
discussed together.


Subject Land Is Urban


Whether the land
in dispute is rural or urban is a factual question which, as a rule, is not
reviewable by this Court.
[12]
 Basic and long-settled is the
doctrine that findings of fact of a trial judge, when affirmed by the Court of
Appeals, are binding upon the Supreme Court.  This admits of only a few exceptions, such as when the findings are
grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; when an inference
made by the appellate court from its factual findings is manifestly mistaken,
absurd or impossible; when there is grave abuse of discretion in the
appreciation of facts; when the findings of the appellate court go beyond the
issues of the case, run contrary to the admissions of the parties to the case
or fail to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will
justify a different conclusion; when there is a misappreciation of facts; when
the findings of fact are conclusions without mention of the specific evidence
on which they are based, are premised on the absence of evidence or are
contradicted by evidence on record.
[13]


The instant case
does not fall within any of the aforecited exceptions.  In fact, the conclusion of the trial court
-- that the subject property is urban land -- is based on clear and convincing
evidence, as shown in its decision which disposed thus:


âx x x  As observed by the court, almost all the
roadsides along the national ghighway [sic] of Bagbaguin, Sta. Maria, Bulacan,
are lined up with residential, commercial or industrial establishments.  Lined up along the Bagbaguin Road are
factories of feeds, woodcrafts [sic] and garments, commercial stores for tires,
upholstery materials, feeds supply and spare parts.  Located therein likewise were the Pepsi-Cola Warehouse, the Cruz
Hospital, three gasoline stations, apartment buildings for commercial purposes
and construction firms.  There is no
doubt, therefore, that the community is a commercial area thriving in business
activities.  Only a short portion of
said road [is] vacant.  It is to be
noted that in the Tax Declaration in the name of Helen Meyers Guzman[,] the
subject land is termed agricultural[,] while in the letter addressed to defendant
Emiliano Cataniag, dated October 3, 1991, the Land Regulatory Board attested
that the subject property is commercial and the trend of development along the
road is commercial.  The Boardâs
classification is based on the present condition of the property and the
community thereat.  Said classification
is far more later [sic] than the tax declaration.â
[14]


No Ground to
Invoke Right of Redemption


In view of the
finding that the subject land is urban in character, petitioners have indeed no
right to invoke Art. 1621 of the Civil Code, which presupposes that the land
sought to be redeemed is rural.  The
provision is clearly worded and admits of no ambiguity in construction:


âART. 1621.  The owners of
adjoining lands shall also have the right of redemption when a piece of rural
land, the area of which does not exceed one hectare, is alienated, unless the
grantee does not own any rural land.


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxxâ


Under this
article, both lands -- that sought to be redeemed and the adjacent lot
belonging to the person exercising the right of redemption -- must be
rural.  If one or both are urban, the
right cannot be invoked.
[15]
 The purpose of this provision which
is limited in scope to rural lands not exceeding one hectare, is to favor
agricultural development.
[16]
 The subject land not being rural
and, therefore, not agricultural, this purpose would not be served if
petitioners are granted the right of redemption under Art. 1621.  Plainly, under the circumstances, they
cannot invoke it.


Second Issue:  
Sale
to Cataniag Valid


Neither do we
find any reversible error in the appellate courtâs holding that the sale of the
subject land to Private Respondent Cataniag renders moot any question on the
constitutionality of the prior transfer made by Helen Guzman to her son David
Rey.


True, Helen
Guzmanâs deed of quitclaim -- in which she assigned, transferred and conveyed
to David Rey all her rights, titles and interests over the property she had
inherited from her husband -- collided with the Constitution, Article XII,
Section 7 of which provides:


âSEC. 7.  Save
in cases of hereditary succession, no private lands shall be transferred or
conveyed except to individuals, corporations, or associations qualified to
acquire or hold lands of the public domain.â


The landmark
case of 
Krivenko vs. Register of Deeds
[17]
 
settled the issue as to who are qualified (and
disqualified) to own public as well as private lands in the Philippines.  Following a long discourse maintaining that
the âpublic agricultural landsâ mentioned in Section 1, Article XIII of the
1935 Constitution, include residential, commercial and industrial lands, the
Court then stated:


âUnder
section 1 of Article XIII [now Sec. 2, Art. XII] of the Constitution, ânatural
resources, with the exception of public agricultural land, shall 
not
  be alienated,â and with respect to public
agricultural lands, their alienation is limited to Filipino citizens.  But this constitutional purpose conserving
agricultural resources in the hands of Filipino citizens may easily be defeated
by the Filipino citizens themselves who may alienate their agricultural lands
in favor of aliens.  It is partly to
prevent this result that section 5 is included in Article XIII, and it reads as
follows:


âSec. 5.  Save
in cases of hereditary succession, no private agricultural land will be
transferred or assigned except to individuals, corporations or associations
qualified to acquire or hold lands of the public domain in the Philippines.â


This constitutional provision closes
the only remaining avenue through which agricultural resources may leak into
aliensâ hands.  It would certainly be
futile to prohibit the alienation of public agricultural lands to aliens if,
after all, they may be freely so alienated upon their becoming private agricultural
lands in the hands of Filipino citizens.  Undoubtedly, as above indicated, section 5 [now Sec. 7] is intended to
insure the policy of nationalization contained in section 1 [now Sec. 2].  Both sections must, therefore, be read
together for they have the same purpose and the same subject matter.  It must be noticed that the persons against
whom the prohibition is directed in section 5 [now Sec. 7] are the very same
persons who under section 1 [now Sec. 2] are disqualified âto acquire or hold
lands of the public domain in the Philippines.â  And the subject matter of both sections is the same, namely, the
non transferability of âagricultural landâ to aliens.  x x xâ
[18]


The 
Krivenko  
rule was recently reiterated in  
Ong  Ching  Po  vs. Court of Appeals,
[19]
 which involves a sale of land to a
Chinese citizen.  The Court said:


âThe capacity to acquire private land is made
dependent upon the capacity to acquire or hold lands of the public domain.  Private land may be transferred or conveyed only
to individuals or entities âqualified to acquire lands of the public domainâ
(II Bernas, The Constitution of the Philippines 439-440 [1988 ed.]).


The 1935 Constitution reserved the
right to participate in the âdisposition, exploitation, development and
utilizationâ of all âlands of the public domain and other natural resources of
the Philippinesâ for Filipino citizens or corporations at least sixty percent
of the capital of which was owned by Filipinos.  Aliens, whether individuals or corporations, have been
disqualified from acquiring public lands; hence, they have also been
disqualified from acquiring private lands.â
[20]


In fine,
non-Filipinos cannot acquire or hold title to private lands or to lands of the
public domain, except only by way of legal succession.
[21]


But what is the
effect of a subsequent sale by the disqualified alien vendee to a qualified
Filipino citizen?  This is not a novel
question.  Jurisprudence is consistent
that âif land is invalidly transferred to an alien who subsequently becomes a
citizen or transfers it to a citizen, the flaw in the original transaction is
considered cured and the title of the transferee is rendered valid.â
[22]


Thus, in 
United
Church Board of World Ministries vs. Sebastian,
[23]
 
in which an alien resident who owned properties in
the Philippines devised to an American non-stock corporation part of his shares
of stock in a Filipino corporation that owned a tract of land in Davao del
Norte, the Court  sustained  the invalidity of such legacy.  However, upon proof that ownership of the
American corporation has passed on to a 100 percent Filipino corporation, the
Court ruled that the defect in the will was ârectified by the subsequent
transfer of the property.â


The present case
is similar to 
De Castro vs. Tan.
[24]
 
In that case, a residential lot was sold to a
Chinese.  Upon his death, his widow and
children executed an extrajudicial settlement, whereby said lot was allotted to
one of his sons who became a naturalized Filipino.  The Court did not allow the original vendor to have the sale
annulled and to recover the property, for the reason that the land has since
become the property of a naturalized Filipino citizen who is constitutionally
qualified to own land.


Likewise, in the
cases of 
Sarsosa vs. Cuenco,
[25]
 Godinez vs. Pak Luen,
[26]
 Vasquez vs. Li Seng Giap
[27]
 
and
 Herrera vs. Luy Kim Guan,
[28]
 which similarly involved the sale
of land to an alien who thereafter sold the same to a Filipino citizen, the
Court again applied the rule that the subsequent sale can no longer be impugned
on the basis of the invalidity of the initial transfer.


The rationale of
this principle was explained in 
Vasquez vs. Li Seng Giap 
thus:


âx x x  [I]f the ban on aliens from acquiring not
only agricultural but also urban lands, as construed by this Court in the
Krivenko case, is to preserve the nationâs lands for future generations of
Filipinos, that aim or purpose would not be thwarted but achieved by making
lawful the acquisition of real estate by aliens who became Filipino citizens by
naturalization.â
[29]


Accordingly, since
the disputed land is now owned by Private Respondent Cataniag, a Filipino
citizen, the prior invalid transfer can no longer be assailed.  The objective of the constitutional
provision -- to keep our land in Filipino hands -- has been served.
