KAPUNAN, J.:


Eyewitness identification
is vital evidence and, in most cases, decisive of the success or failure of the
prosecution.
[1]
 Subject of the Courtâs scrutiny in
the instant criminal case is the credibility of a childâs alleged eyewitness
account on which the appellantâs conviction by the trial court was solely
anchored.


At around three
oâclock in the early morning of December 15, 1991, thirty-three year old Cesar
Victoria was stabbed to death while sleeping by his seven-year old son
Christopher in a rented makeshift room in Tondo, Manila.


Appellant Roman
Meneses was charged with the murder of Cesar Victoria, in an Information dated
December 27, 1991, which reads:


That on or about
December 15, 1991, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with
evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully
and feloniously, with intent to kill, attack, assault and use personal violence
upon one CESAR VICTORIA y FERNANDEZ, by then and there stabbing the latter with
a fan knife (balisong) on the different parts of his body, thereby inflicting
upon the said CESAR VICTORIA y FERNANDEZ mortal wounds which were the direct
and immediate cause of his death immediately.
[2]


The prosecution
presented the following witnesses:  Christopher R. Victoria, SPO3 Jaime Mendoza, SPO3 Eduardo Gonzales and
Medico-Legal Officer Florante Baltazar.


Christopher R.
Victoria testified that he witnessed the stabbing of his father.  He testified that while he lived with his
Kuya Odeng on Kasipagan Street, Tondo, on the night of December 14, 1991, he
went to his fatherâs rented makeshift room to sleep after he (Christopher) was
whipped by his brother. Christopherâs other siblings lived elsewhere in Tondo
and his mother was living in Quezon.  He
further testified that he was awakened from sleep and saw his father being
stabbed in the heart with a âveinte nueve.â  After the assailant ran away, Christopher cried.  


SPO3 Jaime
Mendoza, a police investigator of the Western Police District testified that on
December 15, 1991, a kagawad of Barangay 123, Zone 9, Tondo, Manila  called  the  precinct  informing  him  that Cesar Victoria was
found stabbed to death.  With three
policemen, Mendoza immediately went to the crime scene, arriving there at
around three oâclock in the morning.  Mendoza described the scene as a makeshift room about three by five
square meters.  The room was connected
by a divider with a door to a house owned by the Spouses Ardiete, the victimâs
landlord.  The policemen saw the
victimâs bloodied body, with several stab wounds, lying on a wooden bed.  


Mendoza
testified that when he questioned Christopher, who was then in the house,
Christopher could not identify nor describe the attacker, but that  the  child  said  he could identify him because he knew his
face.  On re-direct examination however,
Mendoza said that Christopher identified the assailant as appellant.


Mendoza and the
policemen brought Christopher to the precinct where his statement was taken.
[3]
 After the appellant was arrested
and turned over to the investigators on December 26, 1991, Christopher was
again brought to the precinct where, during a confrontation with appellant,
Christopher identified appellant as the person who stabbed his father.
[4]


SPO3 Eduardo C.
Gonzales testified that at about two oâclock in the morning of December 25,
1991, he arrested appellant.  The arrest
was based on the report of Angelina Victoria, appellantâs wife, who implicated
appellant in the crime.  The policemen
found appellant at the place pointed to by Angelina, which was a flower box at
the corner of Tuazon and Mithi Streets.  Frisked, appellant yielded a balisong.  After announcing that they were policemen and that appellant was being
arrested as the suspect in the stabbing of Cesar Victoria, Gonzales and his
companions  brought appellant to Police
Station No. 2.  Appellant was later
transferred to the Homicide Section.


On
cross-examination, Gonzales stated that he and his companions merely âinvitedâ
appellant to go with them to the police station for investigation, but that at
the police station, appellant verbally admitted to stabbing Cesar Victoria.
[5]


Medico-Legal
Officer Florante P. Baltazar of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory
conducted the autopsy on the victim.  He
testified in court that the cause of death of the victim, as stated in his
Autopsy Report, was âcardio-respiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage
secondary to stab wounds,â and that the victim sustained five external
injuries, two of which were fatal.
[6]
 He opined that based on the
direction of the stab wounds, the victim was not lying down when stabbed, but
could have been standing or sitting when stabbed by the attacker who could have
also been standing.
[7]


The lone witness
for the defense was the appellant himself, Roman Meneses.  He interposed the defense of denial and
alibi.  Appellant testified that the
victim, who was his brother-in-law, and Christopher used to live with him and
his wife Angelina, the victimâs sister, in their house at A. Tuazon Street,
Tondo, Manila.  On the day of the crime,
appellant alleged that he was in San Isidro, Mexico, Pampanga, and had been
there since the tenth or eleventh of that month, after he had a
misunderstanding with  Angelina.


He further
testified that he was arrested on December 24, 1991, without a warrant after being
implicated in the crime by his wife.  He
was brought to the police station where he was mauled by policemen;  he never admitted though to killing Cesar
Victoria, his brother-in-law.  


Appellant also
denied that there was animosity between him and his brother-in-law.  In fact, when Cesar was stabbed after he
(Cesar) got out of prison, appellant even brought him to the hospital and paid
for his medical expenses.  Appellant even
sent his nephew Christopher to school.
[8]


In a Decision
dated July 26, 1993, the trial found appellant guilty, thus:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby
rendered convicting the accused of the crime of  Murder, and he is hereby sentenced with the penalty of 
Reclusion
Perpetua.


The accused is
hereby ordered to indemnify and pay the heirs of the victim Cesar Victoria the
sum of 
P
50,000.00 as damages sustained by them on account of the
victimâs death.
[9]


In this
appeal, appellant assigns to the trial court the following errors:


I


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING EXCULPATORY
WEIGHT TO THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.


II


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING APPELLANT OF THE
CRIME CHARGED NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.


III


ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT APPELLANT IS GUILTY,
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF MURDER INSTEAD OF HOMICIDE ONLY.
[10]


The issue in the
instant case is credibility.  The
judgment of appellantâs conviction is anchored entirely on the testimony of the
single eyewitness, Christopher Victoria, who identified appellant as the one
who he allegedly saw stab his father.


We find that the
trustworthiness of the identification of appellant by Christopher is dubious,
raising reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court as to appellantâs
culpability.


  It was established that the crime took place
in the wee hours of the morning, before the crack of dawn, at around three
oâclock.
[11]
 The court can take judicial notice
of the âlaws of nature,â
[12]
 such as in the instant case, that
at around three in the morning during the Christmas season, it is still quite
dark and that daylight comes rather late in this time of year.
[13]
 Nowhere in the description of the
crime scene by witness SPO3 Mendoza in his testimony was it established that
there was light or illumination of any sort by which Christopher could see the
attacker.  SPO3 Mendoza testified thus:


Q -
  
You
said you found the body of  the victim,
what (sic) did you found (sic) at the body of  the victim?


A -
  
We
found the body of the victim on adjacent makeshift of the No. 1324.


Q -
  
The
makeshift room which was adjacent to the house, whose house of that makeshift
was adjacent?


A -
  

It was owned by Cesar Victoria and his son Christopher.


Q -
  
You
said you interviewed a couple named Ardiete, where did you see this couple?


A -
  
Inside
the house, sir.


Q -
  

How far is that house to the house of the victim?


A -
  

Only a division within that house, only division separate.


COURT:


Q -
  
You
said that the makeshift was adjacent to the house,  does the Court understand from you that the makeshift  was attach to the house?


A -
  
Part
of the house, Your  Honor.


Q -
  
Is
there an opening on it?


A -
  
Yes,
Your Honor.


Q -
  
How
wide?


A -
  
The
main door going to the house.


Q -
  
Did
you come to know, what that makeshift was for?


A -
  
It
was occupied intended for the victim Cesar Victoria and his son, they actually
rented the space.


Q -
  
So
the place where you found the victim is a place which can be used for living
purposes?


A -
  
Yes,
sir.


Q -
  
How
did you come to that conclusion?


A -
  
Because
that portion, there was a door, there was a door before you can get inside.


FISCAL SULLA:  


Q -
  
How
big is that room more or less?


A -
  
More
or less about three meters or five meters.


Q -
  
Now
who occupied the room adjacent to the room occupied by the victim?


A -
  
The spouses Ardiete, sir.
[14]


The crime took
place in a makeshift room measuring about three by five square meters.  While the room had a door, there was no
mention of a window which could have allowed entry of some kind of light from
the outside.  It is highly improbable
that a young boy, just roused from sleep and his eyes adjusting to the unlit
room, could identify the attacker, much less identify the knife used, as
Christopher did, as a âveinte nueve.â


The prosecution
failed to paint a crystal-clear picture of the environ by which Christopher
could have made an accurate and reliable identification of the attacker.  Christopherâs testimony being improbable, is
not credible.  Evidence is credible when
it is âsuch as the common experience of mankind can approve as probable under
the circumstances.  We have no test of
the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge,
observation, and experience.â
[15]


We now consider
the identification itself.  We  note  a glaring discrepancy, not inconsequential, in the testimony of SPO3
Mendoza regarding Christopherâs identification of appellant.  SPO3 Mendoza testified thus:


Q -
  
Where
was the son of the victim when you arrived?


A - 
 
Inside the house, sir.


COURT: 


Q -  Did you talked (sic) to the son of the victim?


A -
  

Yes, sir.


Q -
  
What
did he tell you?


A - 
 
He told me he can remember the suspect whenever he sees him again
.


Q - 
 
Then he can identify him?


A - 
 
Yes, Your Honor.


ATTY. SARMIENTO:


Q -
  
So
at the time that you were there, the son of the victim was not able to tell you
who the suspect was?


A -
  


Yes, sir.


  x x x 


Q - 
 
Neither the wife nor the husband [referring to the spouses Ardiete,
nor the son tell you that they saw the killing?


A -
  
The
son of the victim said that he can identified (sic) the suspect.


Q -
  
Did
you asked (sic) him if he can identify?


A -
  
Yes,
sir.


Q -
  
And
what did he tell you?


A -
  
He
knows the face of the suspect.


Q -
  
Did
you ask him the name of the suspect, if he knows him at that time?


A -
  
He
canât tell the name
.


Q -
  
Did
he tell you the description of the suspect?


A -
  
He canât tell the description of the
suspect but he insist (sic)
 
that if he can see him again, he can
identify
.
[16]


During his
direct and cross-examination, SPO3 Mendoza asserted that Christopher could not
name his fatherâs attacker nor give a description;  however, in his re-direct examination he said that Christopher
mentioned categorically appellantâs name, Roman Meneses,  thus:


Q -
  
When
you responded to the scene of the crime, and talking to Christopher Victoria
who can identify the suspect, did you asked [sic] him why he can identify the
suspect?


A -
  
Yes,
sir.


Q - 
 
What did he say?


A -
  
He
remember [sic] the face.


Q -
  
And
did you ask him why he can remember the face?


A -
  
Yes,
sir. 
  Because he openly sees the
face,  sice  (sic) he was his uncle.


Q -
  
Did
you asked [sic] the son what is the name of his uncle?


A -
  
Yes,
sir.


                 
  x x x .


Q -
  
What
is the name?


A -
  
Roman Meneses
.
[17]


This
inconsistency in the testimony of SPO3 Mendoza not only tolls on his
credibility as well as the credibility of his testimony, but more
significantly, casts doubt on the trustworthiness, veracity and reliability of
the alleged identification itself.  Significantly,
this inconsistency was noted by the trial court with vexation, but the
Court  merely glossed over the same,
stating that the  identification of
appellant by Christopher during the subsequent confrontation rendered such
inconsistency unimportant.


Even in the
Advance Information
[18]
 prepared by SPO3 Mendoza on
December 15, 1991, no mention was made regarding an identification made by
Christopher when questioned immediately after the crime.  Mendoza wrote:


CHRISTOPHER VICTORIA, 8 years old,
son of victim, who was sleeping beside the latter during the commission of the
crime when interviewed stated that he was awakened while his father was being
stabbed by suspect, whom he claimed he can identify if he can see him again.


Case to be further
investigated and follow-up to determine the motive behind the knife-slaying and
efforts will be exerted to establish the identity of suspect.
[19]


Indeed, it taxes
the credibility of Christopherâs testimony that while he knew appellant prior
to the crime, being his uncle, who for some time he was staying with, he failed
to point to appellant as the attacker when questioned by the police immediately
after the incident.  Wall
[20]
 in his work on eyewitness
identification expound on the danger signals which a trial court judge and the
appellate courts should watch out for when considering identifications in
criminal cases,  thus:


When a person has been the victim
of a crime committed by a friend, acquaintance, relative, or other person
previously familiar to him, and decides to make a complaint to the police, it
is to be expected that he would immediately inform them of the name (or it that
be unknown, then at least the identity) of the person whom they should
arrest.  The victim would normally tell
the police that he had been hit by John Smith, or that her purse had been
snatched by the grocerâs delivery boy.  Of course, some crimes are never reported, for one reason or
another.  But once the victim decides to
make a criminal complaint, then he will almost invariably name or designate the
perpetrator of the crime immediately, if he is able to do so.  The occasional failure of a complainant to
do this is a danger signal of which the courts have sometimes taken note.


In an Idaho prosecution for rape,
for example, the complaining witness identified the defendant at the trial, but
had not accused him when making her original complaint to the police, even
though he was previously known to her.  As an explanation, she testified that she had not recognized him during
the commission of the crime.  The
ensuing conviction was reversed on the ground that he evidence of
identification was insufficient.  In an
Iowa prosecution for assault with intent to commit rape, the complainant was a
young married woman who had known the defendant prior to the commission of the
alleged crime.  She identified him at
the trial, but admitted that she had not recognized him during the assault, for
he had a veil covering his face.  It was
after he left, she testified that it came to her mind that he assault, and on the
same day, she became afraid to stay alone at home while waiting for her husband
to return, and asked none other than the defendant to wait with her â a course
of action which was commented  upon by
the appellate court which reversed the conviction on grounds which included the
insufficiency of the evidence of identification.


In a New York murder prosecution,
the victimâs widow identified the defendant prior to her husbandâs
killers.  Although she knew the
defendant prior to her husbandâs death, she admitted that she had not named him
to the police on the night of the crime, and admitted also that she had told
the coroner that she had never before seen her husbandâs murderers.  A conviction for murder in the first degree
was reversed because the trial judge had failed to charge the jury that they
should consider those facts in determining the accuracy of the
identification.  And in a recent New
York robbery prosecution, it was brought out that the two women who had identified
the defendant at the trial had not immediately named him to the police, even
though they had known him previously, since he was the son of an acquaintance
of one of them.  The conviction was
reversed on appeal, the court stating, with respect to the identifying
witnesses, that:


If we give credence to their
testimony, it appears that they were able to and did observe fully the fact and
general appearance of one of the three alleged robbers who was identified by
them 17 months later as the defendant â¦.  Certainly, if, at the time of the incident, they had recognized the
particular individual as one whom they knew  or as resembling one with whom they were acquainted, it is reasonable to
expect that they would have given this information promptly to the
policeâ¦.  On the state of this record,
there was no plausible explanation for the failure of the two women, or one of
them, to recognized the defendant at the time of the robbery or, in any event,
to pass along to the police within a reasonable time information which would
have led them to identify the defendant as one of the robbers.  We realizeâ¦. That the issue is one of
credibility and that, generally speaking, such issued is for the trier of the
facts.  Here, however, on the whole
record, we have concluded that the finding of the jury as to the guilt of the
defendantâ¦ is contrary to the weight of the evidence; and that, in any event, a
new trial should be had in the interests of justice.


These four cases should suffice to
illustrate how the  courts react to this
danger signal on the rather rare occasions when it is in the record before
them.  Those occasions are rare, it is
submitted, because when the point actually arises in a case, it usually
produces that reasonable doubt which causes a jury to acquit.  It may also be of some significance that
when a jury convicts despite such a glaring weakness in the identification, it
is usually in the type of case that stirs up the greatest emotions â sex crimes
and crimes of violence.  Common sense,
however, dictates that when this danger signal is present in a case, and the
failure of the witness or complainant to do what would normally be done, i.e.,
to name or designate the perpetrator of the crime immediately, is not
satisfactorily explained, no conviction should occur or should be allowed to
stand in the absence of independent and persuasive evidence of the defendantâs
guilt.


The prosecution
did not endeavor to explain Christopherâs failure to name the attacker at the
time he was questioned immediately after the crime.  From  SPO3 Mendozaâs  testimony, Christopher was at that time
coherent and answering clearly questions from the police.


We further find
objectionable Christopherâs identification of appellant during a âshow-upâ at
the police station.  As testified to by
SPO3 Mendoza, âI made confrontation between them,â  referring to Christopher and appellant SPO3.  Mendoza testified on the circumstances
surrounding the âconfrontationâ  between
Christopher and appellant, thus:

COURT:


      
Did you asked (sic) him where did he saw (sic) the
person pointed to?


A -
  
Yes, he told me that he saw him in the room
they rented at Alinia.

In  Tuason v. Court of Appeals,
[25]
 the Court stated that an
identification of the accused during a âshow-upâ or where the suspect alone is
brought face to face with the witness for identification,
[26]
 is seriously flawed.  We stated thus:


x x x the mode of identification
other than an identification parade is a show-up, the presentation of a single
suspect to a witness for purposes of identification.  Together with its aggravated forms, it constitutes the most
grossly suggestive identification procedure now or ever used by the police (See
Louisell, David W., Kaplan, John, and Waltz, Jon R., Cases and Materials on
Evidence;  Wall, Eyewitness
Identification in Criminal Cases, 1968 ed., p. 1263)


In the Tuason
case, during a first encounter in the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)
headquarters, the accused therein was pointed to by the alleged eyewitnesses
after an NBI agent first pointed him out to them.  The Court said that â[the eyewitnessesâ] identification of
[petitioner] from a [subsequent] line-up at the NBI was not spontaneous and
independent.  An NBI agent improperly
suggested to them petitionerâs person.â
[27]


From Mendozaâs
testimony we can gather that appellant was presented as the suspect in the
crime to Christopher inside Mendozaâs office in the Homicide Section of the
police station, or later in the detention cell the boy was made to approach.  While Mendoza did not literally point to
appellant as in the Tuason case, equally pervasive in the âconfrontationâ in
the instant case is what Wigmore calls âthe suggestion of guilty identity.â
[28]


Even applying
the totality of circumstances test set in People v. Teehankee, Jr,
[29]
 formulated and used by courts in
resolving the admissibility and reliability of out-of-court identifications, we
must hold the identification of appellant by Christopher to be seriously
flawed.  The test lists three factors to
consider:


x x x (1) the witnessâ opportunity
to view the criminal at the time of the crime;  (2) the witnessâ degree of attention at that time;  (3) the accuracy of any prior description
given by the witness;  (4) the level of
certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification; (5) the length of
time between the crime and the identification;  and, (6) the suggestiveness of the identification process.  (See Neil v. Biggers, 409 US 188
(1973);  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 US 98
(1977);  Del Carmen, Criminal Procedure,
Law and Practice, 3rd Edition., p. 346)


Indeed, we
cannot discount the angle that young Christopher was influenced by prior
prompting or manipulation by an adult, his aunt Angelina.  Rather than reinforce the identification,  the circumstances pointed out by the trial
court plants in mind the plausibility that appellantâs wife Angelina could have
coached the young impressionable Christopher.  These circumstances are:


First, was the insistence of
[appellantâs] wife as testified by the accused himself, that he was the one who
killed the victim, and was pointed to by her as the assailant, thus, he was
arrested.  Another was the resentment of
the accused against his brother-in-law-victim brought about by the latterâs
intervention in that serious quarrel between him and his wife.  Thirdly, that the accused no doubt disliked
the financial support and subsistence being given by his wife to the victim.


Quite
revealingly, Angelina was the one who went to the police to implicate appellant
in the crime and who directed the police to where he could be found.  She later herded Christopher to the police
station for the boy to give his statement.  She was also with the boy when he was made to identify appellant during
the âconfrontation.â  We see Angelinaâs
actuations as suspect, especially when we consider that per SPO3 Mendozaâs
testimony, when he questioned Christopher immediately after the crime, the boy
could not simply name the attacker. 


And while the
above circumstances, particularly, the supposed resentment of appellant against
the victim, who was his wife Angelinaâs brother, and envy proceeding from
Angelinaâs giving financial support to the victim may constitute motive,  motive alone, without credible positive
identification, cannot be a basis for conviction.
[30]


The People
points out that appellant had verbally admitted having committed the crime at
the time of his arrest and later during the conduct of the investigation.
[31]
 The appellant however during the
trial denied having made such verbal admissions of guilt.  Granting 
arguendo
 that appellant
indeed made such verbal admissions, the same would not be admissible in
evidence against him because the constitutional preconditions for its admission
were not complied with.  The mere assertion
by a police office that after an accused was informed of his constitutional
right to remain silent and to counsel he readily admitted his guilt, does not
make the supposed confession admissible against the purported confessant.
[32]
 Here, it was not even shown that
appellantâs supposed admissions of guilt were made with benefit of counsel.
[33]


It is conceded
that appellantâs defense of alibi is weak.
[34]
 The settled rule however is that
conviction should rest on the strength of the prosecution and not on the
weakness of the defense.
[35]
 The 
onus
 is on the
prosecution to prove the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt, in view of the
constitutional presumption of the innocence of the accused.
[36]
 We must rule that the prosecution
failed to so discharge its burden.
