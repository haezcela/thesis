D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


The basic issue
in this petition for review on 
certiorari
 is whether or not the contract
for the construction of the EDSA Plaza between petitioner BF Corporation and
respondent Shangri-la Properties, Inc. embodies an arbitration clause in case of
disagreement between the parties in the implementation of contractual
provisions.


Petitioner and
respondent Shangri-la Properties, Inc. (SPI) entered into an agreement whereby
the latter engaged the former to construct the main structure of the âEDSA Plaza
Project,â a shopping mall complex in the City of Mandaluyong.


The construction
work was in progress when SPI decided to expand the project by engaging the
services of petitioner again.  Thus, the
parties entered into an agreement for the main contract works after which
construction work began.


However,
petitioner incurred delay in the construction work that SPI considered as
âserious and substantial.â
[1]
 On the other hand, according to
petitioner, the construction works âprogressed in faithful compliance with the
First Agreement until a fire broke out on November 30, 1990 damaging Phase Iâ
of the Project.
[2]
 Hence, SPI proposed the
re-negotiation of the agreement between them.


Consequently, on
May 30, 1991, petitioner and SPI entered into a written agreement denominated
as âAgreement for the Execution of Builderâs Work for the EDSA Plaza
Project.â  Said agreement would cover
the construction work on said project as of May 1, 1991 until its eventual
completion.


According to
SPI, petitioner âfailed to complete the construction works and abandoned the
project.â
[3]
 This resulted in disagreements
between the parties as regards their respective liabilities under the
contract.  On July 12, 1993, upon SPIâs
initiative, the partiesâ respective representatives met in conference but they
failed to come to an agreement.
[4]


Barely two days
later or on July 14, 1993, petitioner filed with the Regional Trial Court of
Pasig a complaint for collection of the balance due under the construction
agreement.  Named defendants therein were
SPI and members of its board of directors namely, Alfredo C. Ramos, Rufo B.
Colayco, Antonio B. Olbes, Gerardo O. Lanuza, Jr., Maximo G. Licauco III and
Benjamin C. Ramos. 


On August 3,
1993, SPI and its co-defendants filed a motion to suspend proceedings instead
of filing an answer.  The motion was
anchored on defendantsâ allegation that the formal trade contract for the
construction of the project provided for a clause requiring prior resort to
arbitration before judicial intervention could be invoked in any dispute
arising from the contract.  The
following day, SPI submitted a copy of the conditions of the contract
containing the arbitration clause that it failed to append to its motion to
suspend proceedings.


Petitioner
opposed said motion claiming that there was no formal contract between the
parties although they entered into an agreement defining their rights and
obligations in undertaking the project.  It emphasized that the agreement did not provide for arbitration and
therefore the court could not be deprived of jurisdiction conferred by law by
the mere allegation of the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement
between the parties. 


In reply to said
opposition, SPI insisted that there was such an arbitration clause in the
existing contract between petitioner and SPI.  It alleged that suspension of proceedings would not necessarily deprive
the court of its jurisdiction over the case and that arbitration would expedite
rather than delay the settlement of the partiesâ respective claims against each
other.


In a rejoinder
to SPIâs reply, petitioner reiterated that there was no arbitration clause in
the contract between the parties.  It
averred that granting that such a clause indeed formed part of the contract,
suspension of the proceedings was no longer proper.  It added that defendants should be declared in default for
failure to file their answer within the reglementary period.


In its
sur-rejoinder, SPI pointed out the significance of petitionerâs admission of
the due execution of the âArticles of Agreement.â  Thus, on page D/6 thereof, the signatures of Rufo B. Colayco, SPI
president, and Bayani Fernando, president of petitioner appear, while page D/7
shows that the agreement is a public document duly notarized on November 15,
1991 by Notary Public Nilberto R. Briones as document No. 345, page 70, book
No. LXX, Series of 1991 of his notarial register.
[5]


Thereafter, upon
a finding that an arbitration clause indeed exists, the lower court
[6]
 denied the motion to suspend
proceedings, thus:


âIt appears from the said
document that in the letter-agreement dated May 30, 1991 (Annex C, Complaint),
plaintiff BF and defendant Shangri-La Properties, Inc. agreed upon the terms
and conditions of the Builders Work for the EDSA Plaza Project (Phases I, II
and Carpark), subject to the execution by the parties of a formal trade
contract. Defendants have submitted a copy of the alleged trade contract, which
is entitled `Contract Documents For Builderâs Work Trade Contractorâ dated 01
May 1991, page 2 of which is entitled `Contents of Contract Documentsâ with a
list of the documents therein contained, and Section A thereof consists of the
abovementioned Letter-Agreement dated May 30, 1991. Section C of the said
Contract Documents is entitled `Articles of Agreement and Conditions of
Contractâ which, per its Index, consists of Part A (Articles of Agreement) and
B (Conditions of Contract).  The said
Articles of Agreement appears to have been duly signed by President Rufo B.
Colayco of Shangri-La Properties, Inc. and President Bayani F. Fernando of BF
and their witnesses, and was thereafter acknowledged before Notary Public
Nilberto R. Briones of Makati, Metro Manila on November 15, 1991.  
The said Articles of Agreement also
provides that the `Contract Documents' therein listed `shall be deemed an
integral part of this Agreementâ, and one of the said documents is the
`Conditions of Contractâ which contains the Arbitration Clause relied upon by
the defendants in their Motion to Suspend Proceedings.


This Court notes, however,
that the `Conditions of Contractâ referred to, contains the following
provisions:


`3.  Contract Document.


Three copies of the
Contract Documents referred to in the Articles of Agreement 
shall be signed
by the parties to the contract
 and distributed to the Owner and the
Contractor for their safe keeping.â (underscoring supplied)


And it is
significant to note further that the said `Conditions of Contractâ is not duly
signed by the parties on any page thereof --- although it bears the initials of
BFâs representatives (Bayani F. Fernando and Reynaldo M. de la Cruz) without
the initials thereon of any representative of Shangri-La Properties, Inc.


Considering the insistence
of the plaintiff that the said Conditions of Contract was not duly executed or
signed by the parties, and the failure of the defendants to submit any signed
copy of the said document, this Court entertains serious doubt whether or not
the arbitration clause found in the said Conditions of Contract is binding upon
the parties to the Articles of Agreement.â (Underscoring supplied.)


The lower court
then ruled that, assuming that the arbitration clause was valid and binding,
still, it was âtoo late in the day for defendants to invoke arbitration.â  It quoted the following provision of the
arbitration clause:


âNotice of the demand for
arbitration of a dispute shall be filed in writing with the other party to the
contract and a copy filed with the Project Manager.  The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time
after the dispute has arisen and attempts to settle amicably have failed; in no
case, however, shall the demand he made be later than the time of final payment
except as otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract.â


Against the
above backdrop, the lower court found that per the May 30, 1991 agreement, the
project was to be completed by October 31, 1991.  Thereafter, the contractor would pay 
P
80,000 for each day
of delay counted from November 1, 1991 with âliquified (sic) damages up to a
maximum of 5% of the total contract price.â


The lower court
also found that after the project was completed in accordance with the
agreement that contained a provision on âprogress payment billing,â SPI âtook
possession and started operations thereof by opening the same to the public in
November, 1991.â  SPI, having failed to
pay for the works, petitioner billed SPI in the total amount of 
P
110,883,101.52,
contained in a demand letter sent by it to SPI on February 17, 1993.  Instead of paying the amount demanded, SPI
set up its own claim of 
P
220,000,000.00 and scheduled a conference on
that claim for July 12, 1993. The conference took place but it proved futile. 


Upon the above
facts, the lower court concluded:


âConsidering the fact that
under the supposed Arbitration Clause invoked by defendants, it is required
that `Notice of the demand for arbitration of a dispute shall be filed in
writing with the other party x x x x in no case x x x x later than the time of
final payment x x x xâ which apparently, had elapsed, not only because
defendants had taken possession of the finished works and the plaintiffâs
billings for the payment thereof had remained pending since November, 1991 up
to the filing of this case on July 14, 1993, but also for the reason that
defendants have failed to file any written notice of any demand for arbitration
during the said long period of one year and eight months, this Court finds that
it cannot stay the proceedings in this case as required by Sec. 7 of Republic
Act No. 876, because defendants are in default in proceeding with such
arbitration.â


The lower court
denied SPIâs motion for reconsideration for lack of merit and directed it and
the other defendants to file their responsive pleading or answer within fifteen
(15) days from notice.


Instead of filing
an answer to the complaint, SPI filed a petition for 
certiorari
 under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the Court of Appeals. Said appellate court
granted the petition, annulled and set aside the orders and stayed the
proceedings in the lower court.  In so
ruling, the Court of Appeals held:


âThe reasons given by the
respondent Court in denying petitionersâ motion to suspend proceedings are
untenable.


1.
 
The
notarized copy of the articles of agreement attached as Annex A to petitionersâ
reply dated August 26, 1993, has been submitted by them to the respondent Court
(Annex G, petition). It bears the signature of petitioner Rufo B. Colayco,
president of petitioner Shangri-La Properties, Inc., and of Bayani Fernando,
president of respondent Corporation (Annex G-1, petition). At page D/4 of said
articles of agreement it is expressly provided that the conditions of contract
are `deemed an integral partâ thereof (page 188, 
rollo
). And it is at
pages D/42 to D/44 of the conditions of contract that the provisions for
arbitration are found (Annexes G-3 to G-5, petition, pp. 227-229). Clause No.
35 on arbitration specifically provides:


Provided always that in case any
dispute or difference shall arise between the Owner or the Project Manager on
his behalf and the Contractor, either during the progress or after the
completion or abandonment of the Works as to the construction of this Contract
or as to any matter or thing of whatsoever nature arising thereunder or in
connection therewith (including any matter or being left by this Contract to
the discretion of the Project Manager or the withholding by the Project Manager
of any certificate to which the Contractor may claim to be entitled or the
measurement and valuation mentioned in clause 30 (5) (a) of these Conditions or
the rights and liabilities of the parties under clauses 25, 26, 32 or 33 of
these Conditions), the Owner and the Contractor hereby agree to exert all
efforts to settle their differences or dispute amicably. Failing these efforts
then such dispute or difference shall be referred to Arbitration in accordance
with the rules and procedures of the Philippine Arbitration Law.


The fact that said conditions of
contract containing the arbitration clause bear only the initials of respondent
Corporationâs representatives, Bayani Fernando and Reynaldo de la Cruz, without
that of the representative of petitioner Shangri-La Properties, Inc. does not
militate against its effectivity. Said petitioner having categorically admitted
that the document, Annex A to its reply dated August 26, 1993 (Annex G,
petition), is the agreement between the parties, the initial or signature of
said petitionerâs representative to signify conformity to arbitration is no
longer necessary. The parties, therefore, should be allowed to submit their
dispute to arbitration in accordance with their agreement.


2.
 
The
respondent Court held that petitioners `are in default in proceeding with such
arbitration.â It took note of `the fact that under the supposed Arbitration
Clause invoked by defendants, it is required that âNotice of the demand for
arbitration of a dispute shall be filed in writing with the other party x x x
in no case x x x later than the time of final payment,â which apparently, had
elapsed, not only because defendants had taken possession of the finished works
and the plaintiffâs billings for the payment thereof had remained pending since
November, 1991 up to the filing of this case on July 14, 1993, but also for the
reason that defendants have failed to file any written notice of any demand for
arbitration during the said long period of one year and eight months, x x x.â


Respondent Court has overlooked the
fact that under the arbitration clause â


Notice of the demand for
arbitration dispute shall be filed in writing with the other party to the
contract and a copy filed with the Project Manager. 
The demand for
arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen
and attempts to settle amicably had failed
; in no case, however, shall the
demand be made later than the time of final payment except as otherwise
expressly stipulated in the contract (underscoring supplied)


quoted in
its order (Annex A, petition). As the respondent Court there said, after the
final demand to pay the amount of 
P
110,883,101.52, instead of paying,
petitioners set up its own claim against respondent Corporation in the amount
of 
P
220,000,000.00 and set a conference thereon on July 12, 1993. Said
conference proved futile. The next day, July 14, 1993, respondent Corporation
filed its complaint against petitioners. On August 13, 1993, petitioners wrote
to respondent Corporation requesting arbitration. Under the circumstances, it
cannot be said that petitionersâ resort to arbitration was made beyond
reasonable time. Neither can they be considered in default of their obligation
to respondent Corporation.â


Hence, this
petition before this Court.  Petitioner
assigns the following errors:


âA.


THE COURT
OF APPEALS ERRED IN ISSUING THE EXTRAORDINARY WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI

ALTHOUGH THE REMEDY OF APPEAL WAS AVAILABLE TO RESPONDENTS.


B.


THE COURT
OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN THE FACTUAL FINDINGS
OF THE TRIAL COURT THAT:


(i)
         
THE PARTIES DID NOT ENTER INTO AN
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.


(ii)
        
ASSUMING THAT THE PARTIES DID ENTER INTO
THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, RESPONDENTS ARE ALREADY IN DEFAULT IN INVOKING THE
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.â


On the first
assigned error, petitioner contends that the Order of the lower court denying
the motion to suspend proceedings âis a resolution of an incident on the
merits.â As such, upon the continuation of the proceedings, the lower court
would appreciate the evidence adduced in their totality and thereafter render a
decision on the merits that may or may not sustain the existence of an
arbitration clause.  A decision
containing a finding that the contract has no arbitration clause can then be
elevated to a higher court âin an ordinary appealâ where an adequate remedy
could be obtained.  Hence, to
petitioner, the Court of Appeals should have dismissed the petition for 
certiorari

because the remedy of appeal would still be available to private respondents at
the proper time.
[7]


The above
contention is without merit.


The rule that
the special civil action of 
certiorari
 may not be invoked as a
substitute for the remedy of appeal is succinctly reiterated in 
Ongsitco v.
Court of Appeals
[8]
 
as follows:


âx x x. Countless times in the
past, this Court has held that `where appeal is the proper remedy, 
certiorari

will not lie.â The writs of 
certiorari
 and prohibition are remedies to
correct lack or excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion equivalent
to lack of jurisdiction committed by a lower court. `Where the proper remedy is
appeal, the action for 
certiorari
 will not be entertained. x x x. 
Certiorari

is not a remedy for errors of judgment. Errors of judgment are correctible by
appeal, errors of jurisdiction are reviewable by 
certiorari
.â


Rule 65 is very clear. The
extraordinary remedies of 
certiorari
, prohibition and 
mandamus

are available only when `there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law x x x.â That is why they are referred to
as `extraordinary.â x x x.â


The Court has
likewise ruled that 
âcertiorari
 will not be issued to cure errors in proceedings
or correct erroneous conclusions of law or fact. As long as a court acts within
its jurisdiction, any alleged errors committed in the exercise of its
jurisdiction will amount to nothing more than errors of judgment which are
reviewable by timely appeal and not by a special civil action of 
certiorari
.â
[9]
v
. Court of Appeals, 327 Phil. 1, 41-42 (1996).9


This is not
exactly so in the instant case.  While
this Court does not deny the eventual jurisdiction of the lower court over the
controversy, the issue posed basically is whether the lower court prematurely
assumed jurisdiction over it.  If the
lower court indeed prematurely assumed jurisdiction over the case, then it
becomes an error of jurisdiction which is a proper subject of  a petition for 
certiorari
 before the
Court of Appeals.  And if the lower
court does not have jurisdiction over the controversy, then any decision or
order it may render may be annulled and set aside by the appellate court.  


However, the
question of jurisdiction, which is a question of law depends on the
determination of the existence of the arbitration clause, which is a question
of fact.  In the instant case, the  lower court found that there exists an
arbitration clause.  However, it ruled
that in contemplation of law, said arbitration clause does not exist.


The issue,
therefore, posed before the Court of Appeals in a petition for certiorari is
whether the Arbitration Clause does not in fact exist.  On its face, the question is one of fact
which is not proper in a petition for 
certiorari
.


The Court of
Appeals found that an Arbitration Clause does in fact exist.  In resolving said question of fact, the
Court of Appeals interpreted the construction of the subject contract documents
containing the Arbitration Clause in accordance with Republic Act No. 876
(Arbitration Law) and existing jurisprudence which will be extensively
discussed hereunder.  In effect, the
issue posed before the Court of Appeals was likewise a question  of law.  Being a question of law, the private respondents rightfully invoked the
special civil action of 
certiorari
.


It is that mode
of appeal taken by private respondents before the Court of Appeals that is
being questioned by the petitioners before this Court.  But at the heart of said issue is the
question of whether there exists an Arbitration Clause  because if an Arbitration Clause does not
exist, then private respondents took the wrong mode of appeal before the Court
of Appeals.


For this Court
to be able to resolve the question of whether private respondents took the
proper mode of appeal, which, incidentally, is a question of law, then it has
to answer the core issue of whether there exists an Arbitration Clause which,
admittedly, is a question of fact.


Moreover, where
a rigid application of the rule that 
certiorari
 cannot be a substitute
for appeal will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, the
provisions of the Rules of Court which are technical rules may be relaxed.
[10]
 As we shall show hereunder, had the
Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for 
certiorari
, the issue of
whether or not an arbitration clause exists in the contract would not have been
resolved in accordance with evidence extant in the record of the case.
Consequently, this would have resulted in a judicial rejection of a contractual
provision agreed by the parties to the contract.  


In the same
vein, this Court holds that the question of the existence of the arbitration
clause in the contract between petitioner and private respondents is a legal
issue that must be determined in this petition for review on certiorari.  


Petitioner,
while not denying that there exists an arbitration clause in the contract in
question, asserts that 
in contemplation of law
 there could not have been
one considering the following points.  
First
,
the trial court found that the âconditions of contractâ embodying the
arbitration clause is not duly signed by the parties. 
Second
, private
respondents misrepresented before the Court of Appeals that they produced in
the trial court a notarized duplicate original copy of the construction
agreement because what were submitted were mere photocopies thereof. The
contract(s) introduced in court by private respondents were therefore âof
dubious authenticityâ because: (a) the Agreement for the Execution of Builderâs
Work for the EDSA Plaza Project does not contain an arbitration clause, (b)
private respondents âsurreptitiously attached as Annexes `G-3â to `G-5â to
their petition before the Court of Appeals but these documents are not parts of
the Agreement of the parties as âthere was no formal trade contract executed,â
(c) if the entire compilation of documents âis indeed a formal trade contract,â
then it should have been duly notarized, (d) the certification from the Records
Management and Archives Office dated August 26, 1993 merely states that âthe
notarial record of Nilberto Briones x x x is available in the files of (said)
office as 
Notarial Registry Entry only
,â (e) the same certification
attests that the document entered in the notarial registry pertains to the
Articles of Agreement only without any other accompanying documents, and
therefore, it is not a formal trade contract, and (f) the compilation submitted
by respondents are a âmere hodge-podge of documents and do not constitute a
single intelligible agreement.â


In other words,
petitioner denies the existence of the arbitration clause primarily on the
ground that the representatives of the contracting corporations did not sign
the âConditions of Contractâ that contained the said clause. Its other
contentions, specifically that insinuating fraud as regards the alleged
insertion of the arbitration clause, are questions of fact that should have
been threshed out below.


This Court may
as well proceed to determine whether the arbitration clause does exist in the partiesâ
contract.  Republic Act No. 876 provides
for the formal requisites of an arbitration agreement as follows:


âSection 4. 
Form of arbitration
agreement
. â A contract to arbitrate a controversy thereafter arising
between the parties, as well as a submission to arbitrate an existing
controversy, 
shall be in writing and subscribed by the party sought to be
charged, or by his lawful agent
.


The making of a contract or
submission for arbitration described in section two hereof, providing for
arbitration of any controversy, shall be deemed a consent of the parties of the
province or city where any of the parties resides, to enforce such contract of
submission.â (Underscoring supplied.)


The formal
requirements of an agreement to arbitrate are therefore the following: (a) it
must be in writing and (b) it must be subscribed by the parties or their
representatives. There is no denying that the parties entered into a written
contract that was submitted in evidence before the lower court. To âsubscribeâ
means to write underneath, as oneâs name; to sign at the end of a document.
[11]
 That word may sometimes be
construed to mean to give consent to or to attest.
[12]
 


The Court finds
that, upon a scrutiny of the records of this case, these requisites were
complied with in the contract in question. The Articles of Agreement, which
incorporates all the other contracts and agreements between the parties, was
signed by representatives of both parties and duly notarized.  The failure of the private respondentâs
representative to initial the `Conditions of Contractâ would therefor not
affect compliance with the formal requirements for arbitration agreements
because that particular portion of the covenants between the parties was
included by reference in the Articles of Agreement. 


Petitionerâs
contention that there was no arbitration clause because the contract
incorporating said provision is part of a âhodge-podgeâ document, is therefore
untenable.  A contract need not be
contained in a single writing.  It may
be collected from several different writings which do not conflict with each
other and which, when connected, show the parties, subject matter, terms and
consideration, as in contracts entered into by correspondence.
[13]
 A contract may be encompassed in
several instruments even though every instrument is not signed by the parties,
since it is sufficient if the unsigned instruments are clearly identified or
referred to and made part of the signed instrument or instruments.  Similarly, a written agreement of which
there are two copies, one signed by each of the parties, is binding on both to
the same extent as though there had been only one copy of the agreement and
both had signed it.
[14]


The flaw in
petitionerâs contentions therefore lies in its having segmented the various
components of the whole contract between the parties into several parts. This
notwithstanding, petitioner ironically admits the execution of the Articles of
Agreement. Notably, too, the lower court found that the said Articles of
Agreement âalso provides that the `Contract Documentsâ therein listed `shall be
deemed an integral part of this Agreement,â and one of the said documents is
the `Conditions of Contractâ which contains the Arbitration Clause.ââ  It is this Articles of Agreement that was
duly signed by Rufo B. Colayco, president of private respondent SPI, and Bayani
F. Fernando, president of petitioner corporation. The same agreement was duly
subscribed before notary public Nilberto R. Briones.  In other words, the subscription of the principal agreement
effectively covered the other documents incorporated by reference therein.


This Court
likewise does not find that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that private
respondents were not in default in invoking the provisions of the arbitration
clause which states that â(t)he demand for arbitration shall be made within a
reasonable time after the dispute has arisen and attempts to settle amicably
had failed.â  Under the factual milieu,
private respondent SPI should have paid its liabilities under the contract in
accordance with its terms. However, misunderstandings appeared to have cropped
up between the parties ostensibly brought about by either delay in the
completion of the construction work or by force majeure or the fire that
partially gutted the project.  The almost
two-year delay in paying its liabilities may not therefore be wholly ascribed
to private respondent SPI. 


Besides, private
respondent SPIâs initiative in calling for a conference between the parties was
a step towards the agreed resort to arbitration. However, petitioner posthaste
filed the complaint before the lower court.  Thus, while private respondent SPIâs request for arbitration on August
13, 1993 might appear an afterthought as it was made after it had filed the
motion to suspend proceedings, it was because petitioner also appeared to act
hastily in order to resolve the controversy through the courts. 


The arbitration
clause provides for a âreasonable timeâ within which the parties may avail of
the relief under that clause.  âReasonablenessâ is a relative term and the question of whether the time
within which an act has to be done is reasonable depends on attendant
circumstances.

 This Court finds that under the
circumstances obtaining in this case, a one-month period from the time the
parties held a conference on July 12, 1993 until private respondent SPI
notified petitioner that it was invoking the arbitration clause, is a
reasonable time. Indeed, petitioner may not be faulted for resorting to the
court to claim what was due it under the contract.  However, we find its denial of the existence of the arbitration
clause as an attempt to cover up its misstep in hurriedly filing the complaint
before the lower court.


In this
connection, it bears stressing that the lower court has not lost its
jurisdiction over the case. Section 7 of Republic Act No. 876 provides that
proceedings therein have only been stayed. After the special proceeding of
arbitration
[16]
 has been pursued and completed,
then the lower court may confirm the award
[17]
 made by the arbitrator.


It should be
noted that in this jurisdiction, arbitration has been held valid and
constitutional. Even before the approval on June 19, 1953 of Republic Act No.
876, this Court has countenanced the settlement of disputes through
arbitration.
[18]
 Republic Act No. 876 was adopted to
supplement the New Civil Codeâs provisions on arbitration.
[19]
 Its potentials as one of the
alternative dispute resolution methods that are now rightfully vaunted as âthe
wave of the futureâ in international relations, is recognized worldwide. To
brush aside a contractual agreement calling for arbitration in case of
disagreement between the parties would therefore be a step backward.


WHEREFORE
, the questioned Decision of the
Court of Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED and the petition for 
certiorari
 DENIED.
This Decision is immediately executory.  Costs against petitioner.


SO ORDERED.
