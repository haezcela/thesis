MENDOZA, J.:


This is a
petition seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals,
[1]
 holding petitioners estopped from
questioning the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court of Iligan City
[2]
 in an ejectment case brought
against them and affirming in toto the decision
[3]
of the aforesaid trial court.


The facts are
summarized in the following portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals:


Plaintiffs [private respondents
Jose C. Deleste, Sr., Jose L. Deleste, Jr., Raul L. Deleste and Ruben L.
Deleste] are the owners of a parcel of land identified as Lot 226 of Iligan
Cadastre survey and covered by TCT No.  T-22148 located at Sabayle Street, Poblacion, Iligan City.  A portion of said lot was leased to
defendants [herein petitioners Nonito Labastida and Constancia Labastida]  for the sum of 
P
200.00 as monthly
rental.


On December 6, 1983, plaintiffs
filed a case against defendants denominated as one for recovery of possession
and damages with preliminary mandatory injunction (pp. 1-4, records).  The complaint alleged, among others, that in
the latter part of 1979 plaintiffs served notice to the occupants-lessees on
their land, including defendants, to vacate the property because the owners
would erect a commercial building thereon; that defendants, instead of heeding
the request, repaired their (defendantsâ) building, put additional
constructions on the lot, partitioned the first storey of the building and
converted the same into four (4) stores or business spaces and subleased the
same to other persons without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiffs; that
on October 24, 1980 or after other previous notices, plaintiffs sent a written
demand to defendants to vacate the land but the latter refused; that âagain, on
February 20, 1983 plaintiffs made and sent another written notice to defendants
to vacateâ but to no avail; and that plaintiffs suffered actual damage in the
amount of 
P
40,000.00 which was the increase of construction materials
and labor costs since 1979 and moral damages in the amount of 
P
100,000.00.


Plaintiffs prayed that defendants
be ordered, 
inter alia, 
  to
remove their building, makeshift structures and fence, vacate the premises and
pay defendants the sum of 
P
100,000.00 as moral damages and 
P
40,000.00
for actual damages âor the difference of the cost of construction materials and
labor in 1979 and at the time when the defendants will be able to vacate the
premises.â


Defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint on two grounds, namely:  (a) lack of jurisdiction of the trial court over the person of one of
the defendants and over the nature or subject matter of the action and (b)
pendency of an ejectment case filed by the plaintiffs against the same
defendants in the municipal court of Iligan City involving the same property.


In support of the first ground,
defendants contended that â[in as much] as the written notice to vacate was
only mailed to defendants last February 20, 1983 and there is no showing that
defendants even received said notice to vacate and therefore there is no
evidence to show that the one (1) year period has elapsed from the time
defendants received the written notice to vacate, coupled by the fact that this
is a clear case of Unlawful Detainer and this case was filed on December 6,
1983, therefore, the court that has jurisdiction over the case is the Municipal
Trial Court in Cities, Iligan City, as provided for in Sections 1 and 2 of Rule
70, of the Revised Rules of Court.â  Additionally, defendantsâ counsel allegedly âfailed to contactâ the
other defendant, Constancia Labastida, so that no jurisdiction had been
acquired over her person.


The motion to dismiss was denied by
the lower court, ruling that the complaint was filed after one year from the
date of demand.  The trial court also
said that it was the manifestation of defendantsâ counsel in open court that
summons was in fact served on Constancia Labastida.  On the issue of 
lis pendens,
 it was brought out that the
ejectment case was dismissed on December 2, 1983 or before the complaint in
Civil Case No. 186 was filed.


In their answer, defendants alleged
that no verbal or written demand to vacate was made by the plaintiffs in 1979
or in 1980 and that âif ever there was any demand it was on February 20,
1983.â  They alleged that they were
personally operating the small sari-sari store, carinderia and snack center
whose capitalization did not exceed 
P
5,000.00.  They insisted that the house was residential and denied that they
expanded the area of their occupancy by building additional structures,
make-shifts or fence thereon.


As affirmative defenses, defendants
reiterated their defense of lack of jurisdiction of the trial court, insisting
that the case should have been filed before the municipal court.
[4]


Petitioners also
claimed before the trial court that the case was covered by the Rent Control
Law (B.P.  Blg. 25) and the Urban Land
Reform Act (P.D. No. 1517) and therefore private respondents did not have a
cause of action against them.


The trial court
gave judgment for the private respondents based on the findings


. . . that the contract of lease
was on a month-to-month basis which gave the plaintiffs the right to eject the
defendants after the expiration of each month; that the demands to vacate had
been made more than a year before the filing of the complaint; that [in violation
of the provisions of B.P. Blg. 25] defendants had subleased portions of the
premises for business purposes; that even assuming that the beauty parlor,
carinderia and snack center in the premises were operated by defendants
themselves, the total capitalization thereof was more than 
P
6,000.00;
that defendants failed to pay the monthly rentals starting March, 1981.
[5]


Petitioners appealed to the
Court of Appeals which, as already stated, affirmed the decision of the trial
court.


The basic issue
raised in the petition before us is whether the trial court had jurisdiction to
try the case filed against petitioners.  The subsidiary questions are whether the action is for recovery of
possession (
accion publiciana
) or for ejectment (
desahucio
) and
whether it was brought within one year.


First
.  Although entitled âFor Recovery of Possession, Damages, with Preliminary
Mandatory Injunction,â it is evident from the allegations of the complaint
filed by private respondents that the case was actually for unlawful
detainer.  Thus, the  complaint alleged in pertinent parts:
[6]


2.  That your plaintiffs are the absolute and registered owners in
common of a parcel of a commercial lot situated at Sabayle Street, Poblacion,
Iligan City which is more particularly described hereunder as follows, to wit:


âCOVERED BY TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF
TITLE


NO. T-22,148 (a.f.)


. . . A parcel of land (Lot #226 of
the cadastral survey of Iligan, Cadastral Case #N-1, LRC Cad. Rec. #N-146),
with improvements thereon, situated in the City of Iligan.  Bounded on the N. by Sabayle St.; on the E.
by Lots Nos.  227 & 2772; on the S.
by Lot #221; and on the W. by Lots Nos. 221 & 220; containing a total area
of 1117 square meters, more or less, and declared for taxation purposes in the
Office of the City Assessor of Iligan City under Tax Declaration No. 79-57502
for the year 1982...â


a portion of which is being
occupied by the herein defendants at a monthly rental of 
P
200.00, the
lease agreement being verbal and on a month to month basis;


3.  That sometime in the latter part of the year 1979, plaintiffs verbally
adviced and served notice to the occupants/lessees of the land above-described,
especially those along Sabayle Street including the herein defendants, to
vacate the land for the reason that the plaintiffs are ready to erect a
commercial building on the land above-described, but the herein defendants
instead of heeding to the plaintiffâs notice to vacate, repaired their
building, replaced the nipa roofing with galvanized sheets, and put up
additional constructions on the lot, fencing the backyard which was not
included in the lease agreement;


4.  That aside from the expansions made by defendants on their house, they
instead partitioned the first storey such that four (4) stores or business
spaces were subleased to other persons without the knowledge and consent of the
plaintiffs;


5.  That after repeated verbal demands to vacate the land [in question]
which defendants only ignored, plaintiffs sent on October 24, 1980 a written demand
to the herein defendants, but in spite of said demand, defendants continued to
fail and still refuse to vacate the premises complained of; again, on February
20, 1983, plaintiffs made and sent another written notice to the defendants to
vacate the above-described property for the reason that plaintiffs are likely
to suffer a more serious and continuing damages on the unabated rising prices
on construction materials and labor costs, but all those demands fell on deaf
ears, just being ignored and refused until the present;


Rule 70, Â§1
provides:


SECTION 1.  
Who may institute proceedings, and when. 
-  Subject to the provisions of the next
succeeding section, a person deprived of the possession of any land or building
by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, or a landlord, vendor,
vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is
unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold
possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied, or the legal
representatives or assigns of any such landlord, vendor, vendee, or other
person, may, at any time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or
withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper inferior court against
the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession, or any
person or persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession,
together with damages and costs.  The
complaint must be verified.


The provisions of this rule shall
not apply to cases covered by the Agricultural Tenancy Act.


In their
complaint, private respondents alleged that they were the registered owners of
the lot subject of the case and thus entitled to possession thereof; that
petitioners were their lessees, paying rent on a month-to-month basis; and that
despite repeated demands to vacate the land made by private respondents,
petitioners refused to leave the premises. This amounts to an allegation that
petitioners were unlawfully withholding possession of the land.  A lease on a month-to-month basis is deemed
to expire at the end of the month upon notice to vacate addressed by the lessor
to the lessee.
[7]
 The refusal of the lessee to leave
the premises gives rise to an action for unlawful detainer.


Private
respondentsâ action is not for recovery of possession.  It is not for a determination which party
has a better right of possession.  Both
the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly found the action to be for
ejectment.  


Second
.  As the action below was for unlawful detainer, the question is whether
it was brought within one year after the unlawful withholding of possession
[8]
 so as to sustain petitionersâ
contention that the action should have been filed before the Municipal Trial Court
rather than in the Regional Trial Court. 


In case several
demands to vacate are made, the period is reckoned from the date of the last
demand.
[9]
 In this case, several demands to
vacate were alleged to have been made by private respondents, the last of which
was dated February 20, 1983.  As the
complaint was filed on December 3, 1983, that is, within one year from February
20, 1983, it is clear that the case should have been brought in the Municipal
Trial Court. 


The Regional
Trial Court would have jurisdiction if the deprivation of possession had been
committed through other means than those enumerated in Rule 70, or if the
period of dispossession under Rule 70 has lasted for more than a year.  


But, in its
resolution denying petitionersâ motion for reconsideration, the Court of
Appeals stated:


On the question of jurisdiction, it
was appellantâs admission in their motion to dismiss filed in the Regional
Trial Court that the last demand to vacate was made on February 20, 1983 while
the complaint for recovery of possession was filed only on 
December 6, 1984
.  Such being the case, the Court 
a quo

was, therefore, correct in ruling that it was the Regional Trial Court and not
the Municipal Trial Court which had jurisdiction over the complaint. [Emphasis
added]
[10]


This is not
true.  Petitionersâ motion to dismiss
did not say that the complaint had been filed on December 6, 
1984
 but
December 6, 
1983
.  In fact,  the complaint attached to the records of
this case shows on its face that it was received by the Regional Trial Court of
Iligan on âDate:  
12-6-83
.â
[11]
 Clearly, the case was  filed within one year from February 20,
1983, the date of the last demand to vacate addressed to petitioners.


Private
respondents do not deny this.  What they
assert, however, is that the one-year period should be reckoned from the time
oral demand was made by them on petitioners in 1979.  This is error.  As we have
already stated, where there are several demands made, the period of unlawful
withholding starts to run from the date of the last demand on the theory that
if the lessor brings no action shortly after the demand, it may be because he
has agreed to the renewal of the lease.  


Third
.  The Court of Appeals held petitioners estopped from questioning the
jurisdiction of the trial court on the ground that in the beginning they denied
having received the notice to vacate sent to them dated February 20, 1983 and
it was only in their answer later filed that they said that âif ever there was
any demand it was on February 20, 1983â for the purpose of arguing that the
case should have been filed in the MTC.


The Court of
Appeals said:


. . . Now, considering that
defendants effectively denied in both their motion to dismiss and answer having
received the notice to vacate dated February 20, 1983, they are now estopped
from questioning the jurisdiction of the court on the particular ground that
the complaint was filed less than one (1) year from the last letter of demand.
[12]


But if private
respondents are to be bound by any representation that no demand had ever been
served on them, then, as provided by Rule 70, Â§2, all the more no action can be
brought against them.  Thus, Rule 70,
Â§2 provides:


SEC. 2.  
Landlord to proceed against tenant only after demand.
 - No
landlord, or his legal representative or assign, shall bring such action
against a tenant for failure to pay rent due or to comply with the conditions
of his lease, unless the tenant shall have failed to pay such rent or comply
with such conditions for a period of fifteen (15) days, or five (5) days in the
case of building, after demand therefor, made upon him personally, or by
serving written notice of such demand upon the person found on the premises, or
by posting such notice on the premises if no persons be found thereon. 


Pursuant to this
provision, no action could be brought against petitioners for alleged violation
of the terms and conditions of their lease agreement unless a notice to vacate
is given to the lessee.  On the other
hand, if as the appellate court held, the action for unlawful detainer is based
on the expiration of the lease, no notice is required.  Any notice given only serves to negate any
inference that the lessor has agreed to extend the period of the lease.  Such a notice is needed only when the action
is due to the lesseeâs failure to pay rent or to comply with the conditions of
the lease.
[13]
 


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Court of
Appeals is REVERSED and the proceedings before Branch 4, RTC of Iligan City in
Civil Case No. 186 are declared NULL and VOID for lack of jurisdiction of that
court.
