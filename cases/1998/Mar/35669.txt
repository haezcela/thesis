The trial court
gave a full account of the evidence submitted by the prosecution that led to
the indictments.


It was about
3:30 in the afternoon of 12 January 1994. Agnes Guirindola, a 20-year old De La
Salle University student, was driving a red Nissan Sentra car with Plate No.
TKR-837 along Panay Avenue, Quezon City, on her way to a bookstore, and
thereafter, to fetch her mother, Mrs. Elvira Guirindola, from work when a man,
passing himself off as a traffic enforcement officer and wearing a âPNPâ
reflectorized vest, flagged her down and motioned her to execute a U-turn
towards him. She complied. Lowering the right front window of her car, she
asked the man, whose name she later learned to be Venancio Roxas, what traffic
violation she had committed. Roxas replied that she had wrongly traversed a
one-way street where, barely two days ago, a little girl had figured in an
accident. Agnes surrendered her driverâs license. Roxas, giving her what
appeared to be a ticket, remarked, âMiss, kunwari pirmahan mo ito,â
[5]
 but seeing that it was not the
usual traffic ticket, she merely put a check sign and returned it. Roxas told
her to open the door. He came on board the car and directed Agnes to proceed to
the next intersection where Roxas motioned her to turn left. After executing a
left turn, she stopped and handed over to him a fifty pesos (
P
50.00)
bill which he accepted. He then returned her license. 


Agnes asked
Roxas where she could drop him off, instead, he suddenly pointed a gun at her
and switched off the engine, saying, âMiss kailangan ko lang ito,â
[6]
 referring to the car. Agnes started
to cry. She pleaded with Roxas to let her go and not harm her. Instead, Roxas
unlocked the rear door to let another man in. The man, identified in open court
as accused-appellant Roberto Gungon, immediately reclined her seat and pulled
her over to the back seat by her arms while Roxas promptly slid into the
driverâs seat. She was told that they were taking her to Philcoa but, after
glancing at his beeper, Gungon, told Roxas, âBoss, negative Philcoa.â
[7]
 Roxas nodded. After a while, Gungon
spoke to Roxas, âBoss, dalhin na natin siya sa dati at doon na natin i-s.â
[8]
 to which Roxas again simply nodded
his head without a word.


Agnes, now
really scared, took out a rosary from her bag and prayed. Momentarily, Roxas
pulled over and alighted from the vehicle while Gungon held Agnes and poked a
gun at her. When Roxas returned, he had with him a bottle of softdrink and
skyflakes which he offered to Agnes. Agnes refused to drink after seeing some
tablets floating inside the bottle. Gungon tried to persuade Agnes to take the
drink, advising her, âSige na, makakatulong ito sa iyo.â
[9]
 The car stopped a second time to
load gas at a gasoline station. Escape was nil; Guirindola made sure of that.
The car thereafter proceeded southwards and on to the South Superhighway.


Roxas took time
out from the wheel at a deserted area to allow him and Gungon to relieve
themselves one after the other. Back on the road, Roxas told Gungon to have
Agnes partake of the softdrink but she continued to resist. Agnes took out her
wallet to get a prayer leaflet Gungon saw a picture and asked Agnes who it was
in the photograph. She replied that it was her sister. Gungon then also took
out some pictures from his wallet to show to her, identifying one photograph as
that of his niece and two others as those of his girlfriend and of Roxas and
his girlfriend and child. Once again, Gungon insisted that she take the drink.
Fearing his menacing look and the gun pointed at her, she took a sip from the
bottle. She was, still later, also forced to swallow two tablets which Roxas
gave to Gungon. She took the tablets but had them under her tongue.


When asked what
she wanted to eat, she said she would prefer a McDonaldâs sandwich. The car
stopped at a bakery shop, where she noticed the address on the signboard
reading, âSto Tomas Batangas.â Roxas went out and returned with a âtaisanâ cake
which he handed over to Agnes but she just held it. Time passed, and somehow
she lost consciousness. It was about 9:30 p.m. when she found herself lying at
the back seat with her legs on the lap of Gungon. She noticed that her pieces
of jewelry, bracelets, earrings, ring, necklace and a wristwatch, as well as
cash, were missing and that her pair of shoes had been removed. She was told
that the items were just being meanwhile kept for her. The pair of shoes,
however, were returned to her. By this time, a third man was already seated in
front of the car with Roxas.


When it was her
turn to relieve herself, Roxas stopped the car at a deserted area. Gungon
escorted her to a place not far away from the car. Just as she was getting up,
after relieving herself, she saw a âwhite sparkâ to her right and she fell. She
was shot. Feeling weak and unable to get up, she was still able to get a glance
at Roxas walking back to the car. Then she passed out.


When she came
to, Roxas, Gungon, and the third man, as well as the car, were nowhere insight.
She managed to get up and slowly walked down the road until she reached a small
house. Inside were two kids and a teenager, who, apparently shocked by her
appearance, hurriedly left. She was bleeding profusely from the neck and face.
She looked around the house but not finding anyone, she went to the sala to lie
down. People soon arrived on a vehicle. She again lost consciousness and
regained it only at the Batangas Regional Hospital.
[10]
 The hospital, which was ill
equipped to give full medical treatment advised her to transfer to a Manila
hospital. The medical certificate described the gunshot wound:


âGunshot wound,
POE, Zygomatic area (R), POX Sub-mandibular area (L); Fx, zygomatic arch &
condylar area, (R) Sec to GSW; Submandibular Gland Involvement with sinus
tract.â
[11]


Recounting the
circumstances that paved the way for the ultimate arrest of Gungon, the trial
court narrated:


âxxx. The crimes charged herein
could have easily remained unsolved because the victim 
did not know
 any
of her tormentors. That she was abandoned in a dark and far away place strange
to her, having been saved from the claws of sure death only by her abductorâs
false belief of having already done her in with a single gunshot, would have
made the escape of the criminals irreversible. Fate had it that her survival
spelled the beginning of her tormentorsâ undoing, for her ordeal was
immediately brought to the attention of the NBI which moved and investigated
without delay and hesitation. Cartographic sketches drawn from the
recollections of the victim later started the procedure to identify the unknown
perpetrators. The alacrity, coordination, and ingenuity of NBI agents Regner
Feneza and Miralles led to the success of the procedure.


âFeneza recounted that on January
17, 1994 he met at the NBI offices in Manila with Miralles, who was earlier
assigned to the case of Agnes, because Miralles had left word that he wanted to
consult with Feneza. It seems that Feneza was the agent handling the Virginia
Samaniego Villena case, another kidnapping case where the 
modus operandi

had 
striking similarities
 with the kidnapping of Agnes. In their
meeting, Miralles showed and lent to Feneza the cartographic sketches in the
Agnes kidnapping. Feneza referred to his Villena files and discovered a
distinct similarity of a cartographic sketch to some of the Villena suspects
with pictures in his files. With Mirallesâ permission, Feneza met with and
talked to Agnes at the V. Luna Medical Center, and showed her about 3 or 4
pictures from his files.


âAs Feneza testified: â
When I
gave the pictures to her, she looked at them and she positively identified one
in the pictures to be one of her abductors, she nearly fainted at that time.
â
Agnes had thereby positively identified Roberto Gungon, whom Feneza had already
met in October or November, 1992 in connection with the Villena case. He
reported this breakthrough to his superiors, who immediately authorized the
search for Gungon.


âGungon could not be arrested
sooner. Based on information given to the NBI, he and his live-in partner had
left Manila by car on a Wednesday, passed through Catbalogan Samar, and were
bound for Davao. According to Feneza, an informant provided the information
about Davao being the final destination; he testified: âBefore he left, he left
his pocket bell to somebody whom he was able to talk to. At the same time; they
were calling a person and they told this person that they were in Legaspi about
to board a ferry boat going to Davao.â The information, Feneza disclosed how
the NBI discovered the informant. It seems that Manila Prosecutor Alice Vidal
had been approached by a certain Mrs. Atencio, supposedly Gungonâs
mother-in-law, to confide Gungonâs whereabouts and to seek help; Prosecutor
Vidal, in turn, notified the Makati Police Department, which happened to be
collaborating with the NBI on the case. The Makati Police Department relayed
the developments to NBI, which sent agents to meet with Mrs. Atencio in the
office of Prosecutor Vidal, and it was there where Mrs. Atencio disclosed the
destination of Gungon and his partner. The pocketbell beeper was subsequently
delivered my Mrs. Atencio to Feneza in Cubao, under a receipt.


âFeneza and fellow agent Arnold
Lazaro flew to Davao on the following Friday, still in January, but Gungon and
his partner could arrive there only on Saturday. On Sunday evening, the agents
located the arrested him and detained him at their Regional Office in Davao.
They flew him back to Manila of the first available flight on Monday. At the 
lineup

held on February 1, 1994 at the NBI offices in Manila, Agnes picked Gungon out
and positively identified him as one of her kidnappers.


âAfter the 
lineup

identification, the NBI checked the contents of the 
blue bag
 that Gungon
had brought along from Davao and found therein, among others, a 
Nissan

key chain with a key; a picture of a woman, another picture of a man (Venancio
Roxas), woman, and child; and a rosary. These articles were turned over to the
NBI evidence custodian and were later presented in court. Feneza and Lazaro
prepared their joint affidavit and other papers before transmitting the matter
to the Department of Justice. Feneza readily identified and pointed to Gungon
in open court during trial.â
[12]


The defense
version varies materially from that given by the prosecution.


Roberto Gungon,
an employee of the Metropolitan Manila Authority, testified that between 3:30
and 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon of 12 January 1994, he had just come from a
friendâs house and was waiting for a taxicab along Panay Avenue, Quezon City,
when a car stopped in front of him. It was Venancio Roxas, an acquaintance he
once met at a New Yearâs party, who asked him where he was going. Gungon
replied that he was waiting for a taxicab to get him to Cubao. Roxas, who was
with a lady companion, opened the door of the car and said, â
Halika na, at
idadaan ka na namin
.â He boarded and sat at the rear. Roxas drove towards
Cubao. Gungon alighted at the foot of the underpass in Cubao, only to again
board the car when Roxas invited him to go with them to Batangas.


Roxas proceeded
to the South Superhighway with Agnes in the front right seat. On the way, Agnes
reminded Roxas that her mother was waiting for her. Agnes took out her wallet
and showed Gungon her ID, her picture, and her sisterâs picture, and in turn,
he, too, drew out his wallet from his pocket and showed Agnes his wifeâs
picture. The car stopped at a bakery in Sto. Tomas, Batangas, where Agnes and
Roxas alighted to buy a piece of cake and some softdrinks. Tired, after along
drive, Gungon and Agnes had both fallen asleep. She awoke after some time and
requested that the car stop to allow her to relieve herself. Gungon later
learned from an investigator that the place was somewhere in Batangas City.
Roxas accompanied Agnes. Gungon was left alone in the car. After about 3 to 5
minutes, he heard a gunshot and felt that something untoward had happened. He
lowered the car window to look, and he saw someone, whom he presumed to be
Roxas, coming towards his direction, holding a gun. Agnes was not with him. Out
of apprehension, he alighted from the car, ran away, and hid in the nearby
trees until Roxas finally drove away. He took a bus back to Manila, reaching
home at about 10:30 that evening.
[13]


In its decision,
promulgated on 15 February 1995, the RTC, Hon. Lucas P. Bersamin presiding,
concluded:


âWHEREFORE, judgement is hereby
rendered finding the accused ROBERTO GUNGON y SANTIAGO 
guilty
 beyond
reasonable doubt:


â1.  In Criminal Case No. Q-94-54285, for

â3.  In Criminal Case No. Q-94-54287, for robbery, and sentencing him

, as

âThe accused shall be credited with
the entire period of his preventive imprisonment in accordance with Art. 29,
Revised Penal Code, provided he is qualified thereof pursuant to said legal
provision.


âThe accused Gungon is further

P
218,757.90, plus interest 
at
the legal rate
 from the filing of the information until full payment; and
double cost of suit.


âThese cases shall
be archived as far as they concerned Venancio Roxas y Arguelles.â
[14]


In the instant
appeal, Gungon has continued to assert his innocence, assigning the following
errors allegedly committed by the trial court:


âI


âTHE TRIAL
COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN RULING THAT APPELLANT GUNGON AND ROXAS CONSPIRED TO
COMMIT THE CRIMES SUBJECT OF THE INSTANT APPEAL.


âII

âIII


âTHE TRIAL

âIV


âTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING APPELLANT GUNGON OF THE
CRIME OF VIOLATION OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6539 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE
ANTI-CARNAPPING ACT.â
[15]


Appellantâs
challenges, in essence, would revolve on the issue, once again, of credibility
of witnesses. In monotone, this Court has constantly ruled that in the determination
of the veracity of testimony, the assessment by the trial court is accorded the
highest degree of respect and will not be distrubed of appeal unless, of
course, it is seen to have acted arbitrarily or with evident partiality.
Contrary to appellantâs contention, however, it is the Courtâs view that the
trial court has taken due care in evaluating the testimonies given at the
witness stand. This much would easily be apparent from the following excerpts
of the appealed decision.


âUpon thorough consideration of the
evidence, the Court finds the testimony and version of Agnes to be the truth of
what transpired on January 12, 1994 and that there was no credible fact or
circumstance presented in the entire course of the trial, including her
cross-examination by the Defense, by the which the neutral objective, and
uninvolved mind could reasonably doubt her sincerity and trustworthiness. The
complainant and the accused were subjected to the closest personal observation
during their stints as witnesses. There were contrasts in their demeanors on
the one hand, the victim was 
firm, sincere, and collected 
when she
narrated even the most painful parts of her ordeal, easily impressing the Court
by her straightforward manner and strong recall of the details; while, 
on
the other hand
, although Gungon tried very much to appear cool and
composed, he could not deceive the Court by hiding behind the veneer of his
feigned expressions and concealing what happened by a clever 
faÃ§ade
 of
denials.


âxxx
        
xxx
     
xxx


âGungon failed the
test of credibility by relying on an implausible defense and on mere denials.
To decide issues of credibility, the testimonies of witnesses are tested for
their plausibility of probability, i.e., whether they were contrary to the
natural course of things, or to common observation, experience, and common
sense, or to contrary to natural laws, or exhibit incredible coincidences.
Evidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible
witness, but it must be credible in itself â such as the common experience and
observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances. We have
no test of the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge,
observation, and experience. Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the
miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance.â
[16]


The defense,
verily anchors itself on the bare denial of appellant of the specific acts
imputed by the prosecution against him. Certainly, this negative assertion
cannot prevail over the unimpeached testimony of the victim describing in
sufficient detail the active participation of appellant in the commission of
the crimes charged. In the face of the clear and positive declaration of the
victim herself, the defense of denial hardly assumes probative value and sinks
down the drain even further with the absence of any evidence of a sinister or
nefarious motive on the part of the complainant to impute a crime so grave a
wrong as that made out in the Information.


The argument
that the finding of conspiracy between appellant and Venancio Roxas to commit
the crimes charged has been based by the trial court merely on inferences,
conjectures and presumptions is bereft of merit. A conspiracy exists when two
or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and
decide to commit it.
[17]
 The proof of the agreement need not
rest on direct evidence;
[18]
 the agreement itself may be
inferred from the conduct of the parties disclosing a common understanding
among them relative to the commission of the offense.
[19]
 Jurisprudential account tells us
consistently that the conduct of the accused before, during, and after the
commission of the crime may be considered to show an extant conspiracy.
[20]


The trial court,
exhibiting keen perception on the whole bulk of evidence before it, has come up
with a number of observations not only to prove conspiracy but likewise to
establish appellantâs own part therein.


â1.
           
Gungonâs
presence on Panay Avenue and his meeting with Roxas were not purely
coincedental and by chance but intentional and prearranged. Roxas was
representing himself to Agnes as a traffic officer by his wearing of the PNP
reflectorized vest while Gungon was employed by the MMA, which had a direct
connection with the functions assumed by Roxas. Roxas and Gungon were
associated with each other far longer than the latter has admitted.


âxxx
        
xxx
     
xxx


â2.
           
Gungonâs
insistence that Roxas was only a casual acquaintance is rejected as devoid of
truth because it is inconsistent with and contrary to the established facts and
circumstances. The records already showed that Gungon knew several personal
circumstances about Roxas, including the fact that Roxas was formerly employed
at MMA and that Roxas was unemployed when the incident tool place, but was the
president of a homeownerâs association in Commonwealth Avenue. Moreover,
Gungonâs conduct in relation to Roxas during the entire duration of the trip
from Panay Avenue to Batangas City, be it judged from Agnesâ point of view or
from Gungonâs own, exhibited a deeper and closer familiarity and association
that Gungon would admit. He called Roxas âboss,â an appellation of familiarity,
if not also subordination. He never protested his being invited to the unplanned
Batangas trip. He never asked who Agnes was, not where Roxas and Agnes had come
from.


âIn any case, even assuming that
Gungon, indeed, just happened to be on Panay Avenue that afternoon, implying
thereby that he had no prior understanding with Roxas to meet thereat and also
indicating thereby that their acquaintance was merely casual, the Court is
still puzzled: (a) why Roxas on his part, should have stopped for him; should
have offered to convey him to wherever he was going; and should even invite him
to go on the unplanned trip to distant Batangas without notice to the latterâs
family, unless they were more familiar and closer, and (b) why Gungon, on his
part, should have agreed to go to Batangas unless he was in on the plans of
Roxas. The unbelievable unnaturalness of Gungonâs disavowal of his connection
with Roxas rendered his testimony suspect and implausible.


âxxx
        
xxx
     
xxx


â4.
           
Another
inconsistency was detected between Gungonâs allegations, on one hand, that he
concealed himself in the nearby trees from the returning Roxas after the
shooting of Agnes and allowed Roxas to leave in the Nissan car without him, so
that he returned to Manila by bus, and, on the other hand, that the Nissan
keychain and the key of the bar lock were recovered from his blue bag. If he
was to be believed, how did he come into the subsequent possession of the
keychain and the key unless he and Roxas had met after the shooting?


âxxx
        
xxx
     
xxx


6. On account of his admitted
presence during the trip, although protesting his innocence, the Court has also
carefully analyzed Gungon's conduct following the criminal incidents and found
such conduct indicative of guilt rather than innocence. Despite his insistence
to the contrary, he knew that at least one serious crime had been perpetrated
because he had heard a shot and had seen Roxas returning with a firearm at hand
but without Agnes. Yet, he never reported the incidents to anyone else, most of
all to the authorities, despite his allegations that he thereafter continued to
report to work at MMA. The civic-minded and dedicated public servant that he
alleged himself to be notwithstanding, he did not impress the Court that he was
truly guiltless because of his unexplained failure to report to the
authorities.


âOn the matter of
the Davao land trip being taken on January 28, 1994, the Court must have to
consider it as positively indicative of flight. It should first be mentioned,
as a premise for this conclusion, that Gungon inextricably contradicted himself
on this point, since, in his direct testimony, he cited the calls made by
somebody about two or three days before to the office of Ms. Atencio asking her
to meet a person near the Makati Police Department about an alleged estafa case
in relation to a roofing transaction as justification for the trip, implying
that it was sudden and unplanned; whereas, in the cross-examination, he stated
that he and his wife had planned the Davao trip for vacation purposes even
before New Yearâs Day, 1994. Aside from negatively reflecting of Gungonâs testimonial
integrity, such self-contradiction, not being a merely minor or inconsequential
development in the Defenseâs presentation, exposed the Davao trip to be for
what is was â the flight of a guilty man.â
[21]


It would defy
logic and common sense to conclude that the above circumstances and events
implicating appellant to the crime were all purely coincidental.


Nor did the
trial court err in convicting appellant of the crime of kidnapping and serious
illegal detention. Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code defines the felony
thus:


âArt. 267.  Kidnapping and serious illegal detention. â 


Any private individual who shall
kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty,
shall suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.


â1.
           
If
kidnapping of detention shall have lasted more than three days.


â2.
           
If
it shall have been committed simulating public authority.


â3.
           
If
any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person
kidnapped or detained; or if threats to kill him shall have been made.


â4.
           
If
the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, except when the accused is
any of the parents, female or a public officer.


âThe penalty shall be death where
the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purposes of extorting ransom
from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances
abovementioned were present in the commission of the offense.


âWhen the victim is killed or dies
as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or
dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed. (As amended by Sec. 8,
Republic Act No. 7659).â(Underscoring ours.)


The crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention consists not only
in placing a person in an enclosure but also in detaining that person or
depriving him in any manner of his liberty.
[22]


Actual restraint
of the victimâs liberty was evident in the instant case from the moment Agnes
was taken at gunpoint from Panay Avenue to a remote place in Batangas. The
victim testified, thus:


âQ.
  
What
did he do with the 
P
50.00 bill?


âA.
  
He
received it.


âQ.
  
After
receiving the 
P
50.00 bill, what did he do next?


âA.
  
He
gave my license back.


âQ.
  
After
getting back your license, what happened?


âA.
  
He
immediately poked a gun at me.

âQ.
  
After
Venancio Roxas pointed a gun at you, what happened next?


âA.
  
He
switched off the engine and then told me, âMiss, kailangan ko lang ito.â


âQ.
  
After
that, what happened?


âA.
  
I
was so terrified, I cried and then pleaded to him to let me go, to take
anything but not to harm me.


âQ.
  
Did
he heed your plea?


âA.
  
No,
sir.


âQ.
  
What
happened next?


âA.

some minutes, he opened the back door of the car and then someone entered,

âQ.
  
After
that second guy entered the car, what happened?


âA.
  
He
reclined the seat and he took my arm and pulled me to the back seat.


âQ.
  
While
the second guy who entered the car reclined your seat, and pulled your arm
towards the back seat, what was Roxas doing?


âA.
  
He
was sitting at the passenger seat and when I was at the back seat already, he
tool the driverâs seat.


âQ.
  
This
second guy who boarded the car and pulled you towards the back seat, is he
inside the courtroom?


âA.

âA.
  
Yes,

âCourt

You said that
after you refused to drink the bottle of softdrink being offered by Roxas,
Roxas handed the bottle over to Gungon?


âA.
  
Yes,
sir.


âQ.
  
After
Gungon took the bottle, what happened next?


âA.

âxxx

âState Pros. Agcaoili


And what was your reaction to that
remark of Gungon?


âA.
  
Of
course, I still refused to drink.


âQ.
  
And
when you refused, what happened next?


âA.
  
He
was still holding the bottle, and then he continued to drive and then stopped
to a nearby gas station.


"Q.
  
what did you do at the gas station if you did anything?


"A.
  
He gassed up


"Q.
  
After gassing up, what else happened?


"A.
  
During that time, I was trying to escape but I
cannot escape since Gungon was holding me and from time to time poking a gun at
me.â
[23]


"Q.
  
Going back to your earlier testimony, Madam Witness, you testified
earlier that along the way, Mr. Roxas alighted from the car and bought Sprite
and skyflakes, how about you and Mr. Gungon when Mr. Roxas alighted from the
car?


âxxx
                     
xxx
     
xxx


"Q.
  
What was Mr. Gungon doing while Mr. Roxas was buying softdrinks and
skyflakes?


âxxx
                     
xxx
     
xxx


"A.
  
Gungon and I were still inside the car and he was holding me and
from time to time poking a gun at me.


âxxx
                     
xxx
     
xxx


"Q.
  
You also testified earlier that along the way Roxas stopped
somewhere at the South Expressway and took a leak, what was Mr. Gungon doing
while Mr. Roxas was taking a leak?


"A.
  
The same thing when Roxas left the car.


"Q.
  
What about when it was Mr. Gungonâs turn to take a leak, what was
Mr. Roxas doing?


"A.
  
Roxas held me and he was holding the door and
checking if it was locked and poking a gun at me.â
[24]


The evidence
would likewise show, ineluctably, the commission of frustrated murder. Not
rebutted was the medical finding that the gunshot wound sustained by the victim
would have resulted in the death of the victim had it not been for the proper
medical attention given to her.
[25]


The trial court
has, too, properly appreciated the attendance of treachery in the commission of
the offense. Treachery exists when the offender employs means, methods, or
forms in the execution of the crime which tend directly and specially to insure
its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the
offended party might take.
[26]
 It bears stressing that the
unsuspecting and defenseless victim had sustained the gunshot wound while still
trying to get up after relieving herself.


The idea of
killing the victim was likewise premeditated; Agnes testified:


âState Pros. Agcaoili


After this second guy who pulled you to the back seat
whom you just identified as accused Roberto Gungon pulled you towards the back
seat, what happened next?


"A.
  
I was asked where they are taking me.


"Q.
  
What was their reply if any?


"A.
  
They said they are taking me to Philcoa.


"Q.
  
After telling you that they are taking you to Philcoa, what else
happened?


"A.
  
Gungon got his beeper and then he read it, then told Roxas, boss,
negative Philcoa.


"Q.
  
And what was the reaction of Roxas?


"A.
  
He just nodded.


"Q.
  
And what else happened?


"A.
  
After that, Gungon said, âBoss, dalhin na natin siya sa dati at
doon na natin i-S.â


"Q.
  
And how did Roxas react to that remark of Gungon?


"A.
  
The same, he just nodded.â
[27]


 


The perpetrator of the premeditated killing, 
albeit
 frustrated
was hatched from the moment the accused and his co-conspirator took the victim
in Quezon City until she was ultimately âexecutedâ in Batangas to insure
impunity to the perpetrators by eliminating the only witness.


Murder is
punishable under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code by 
reclusion perpetua

to death if committed with the attendant circumstances, among other
circumstances, of treachery and evident premeditation.
[28]
 When the crime is âfrustrated,âf a
âpenalty lower by one degreeâ or, in this case, 
prision mayor
 to 
reclusion
temporal
 is imposed.


The crime of
kidnapping and serious illegal detention has been correctly complexed by the
trial court with frustrated murder. A complex crime is committed when a single
act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, or when an offense is
a necessary means for committing the other.
[29]


In a complex
crime, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be
applied in its maximum period.
[30]
 Since the kidnapping and serious
illegal detention is the more serious crime, the proper penalty under Article
267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, should be
applied in its maximum period.


The Court finds
merit, however, in appellantâs third assigned error.


Appellant would
have it that the trial court erred in convicting him of robbery considering
that the taking of the victimâs jewelry and cash were perpetrated while the
latter was asleep. The victim herself testified that shortly after the car had
proceeded from Sto. Tomas, Batangas, she lost consciousness and regained it
only at about 9:30 that evening. She then found herself lying at the back seat
minus her personal belongings with a total value of 
P
38,000.00.
[31]


Article 293 of
the Revised Penal Code defines robbery to be one committed by any âperson who,
with intent to gain, shall take any personal property belonging to another, by
means of violence against or intimidation of any person, or using force upon
anything xxx.â Robbery may thus be committed two ways: (a) with violence, or
intimidation of persons
[32]
 and (b) by the use of force upon
things.
[33]
 To be then liable for robbery with
violence against or intimidation of persons, the following elements must
concur.


1)  that there be personal property belonging to
another;


2)  that there is unlawful taking of that
property;


3)  that the taking must be with intent to gain;
and


4)  that there is violence against or
intimidation of any person or use of force upon things.


It would appear
that the taking of the victimâs jewelry and cash came only by way of an
afterthought on the part of the appellant. The taking was not attended by
violence or intimidation upon the person of Agnes. The absence, however, of
violence or intimidation did not exculpate appellant from liability for the
crime of theft, punishable by Article 308, in relation to Article 309, of the
Revised Penal Code, 
viz
:


âArt. 308.  Who are liable for theft. â Theft is
committed by any person who, with intent to gain but without violence against,
or intimidation of persons nor force upon things, shall take personal property
of another without the latterâs consent.â


âArt. 309.  Penalties. â Any person guilty of theft
shall be punished by:


â1.
           
The
penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum ans medium periods, if the value
of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos;
but if the value of the things stolen exceed the latter amount, the penalty
shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph, and one
year for each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which
may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years.â


The Information
in Criminal Case No. Q-94-54287 contains sufficient allegations, adequately
proven by the prosecution during the trial, to warrant a conviction of
appellant for the crime of theft. Section 4, Rule 120, of the 1988 Rules on
Criminal Procedure provides on this score; thus:


âSection 4.
         
Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof. â
When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or
information, and that proved or established by the evidence, and the offense as
charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, included in
that which is charged, or of the offense charged included in that which is
proved.â


Since the value
of the personal property taken from the victim amounted to 
P
38,000.000
the penalty imposable is the maximum period of the penalty prescribed by
Article 309 which is the maximum of 
prision
 
mayor
 in its minimum
and medium periods plus one year for the additional ten thousand pesos in
excess of 
P
22,000.00. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
penalty for this particular offense of theft that may thus be imposed is
anywhere from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
prision
correctional
 minimum period to six (6) years of prision correccional
maximum period, as minimum, to anywhere from eight (8) years, eight (8) months
and one (1) day to ten (10) years of 
prision mayor
 medium period, plus
one (1) for the additional 
P
10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00 value of
the property taken, or eleven (11) years of prision mayor maximum period, as
maximum.


Lastly,
appellant contends that he should not have been convicted of violation of
Republic Act No. 6539, otherwise known as the Anti-Carnapping Act, because the
taking of the subject motor vehicle. Roxas had already acquired effective
possession of the subject vehicle. This argument would  have been consequential had there been no
finding of conspiracy between appellant and Venancio Roxas. In conspiracy, to
once again stress it, the act of the other co-conspirator and, therefore it is
of no moment that an accused had not taken part in the actual commission of
every act constituting the crime,
[34]
 each of the conspirators being held
in the same degree of liability as the others.


WHEREFORE
, the Court sustains the appealed
decision of the trial court, dated 15 February 1995, except for appellantâs
conviction for the crime of ROBBERY in Criminal Case No. Q-94-54287 which is
hereby MODIFIED to one of THEFT of which offense appellant is found guilty
beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced to a prison term of from two (2) years,
four (4) months and one (1) day of 
prision correccional
, as minimum to
eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 plus
one (1) year for the additional 
P
10,000.00 in excess of 
P
20,000.00
value of the property taken or a total of nine (9) years, eight (8) months and
one (1) day, as maximum. The decision of the court 
a quo
 with respect to
Criminal Case No. Q-94-54285 and Criminal Case No. Q-94-54286 is AFFIRMED. In
Criminal Case No. Q-94-54285, four members of the Court, although maintaining
their adherence to the separate opinions expressed in People vs. Echegaray
(G.R. No. 117472, 07 February 1997) that Republic Act No. 7659, insofar as it
prescribes the death penalty, is unconstitutional nevertheless, bow to the
ruling of the Court, by a majority vote that the law is unconstitutional and
that the death penalty should be according be imposed.


In accordance
with Section 25 of Republic Act No, 7659, amending Article 83 of the Revised
Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, let the records of this case be
forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of the
pardoning power.
