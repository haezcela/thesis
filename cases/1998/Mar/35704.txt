[ G.R. No. 124478, March 11, 1998 ]


VICTOR AFRICA, PETITIONER,
VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (THIRD DIVISION); ROMAN MABANTA,Â  JR.;Â 
ANDÂ Â  EDUARDO DE LOS ANGELES, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




DAVIDE, JR., J.:


This petition
for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeks to annul the
resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated 30 January 1996
[1]
 and 29 March 1996
[2]
 dismissing Civil Case No. 0146
[3]
 and denying petitionerâs motion for
reconsideration, respectively.


A summary of the
prior relevant events, as gathered from the voluminous records elevated to this
Court by the Sandiganbayan
[4]
 and from G.R. No. 83831 entitled 
Africa
v. PCGG,
[5]
 is appropriate for a better
understanding of the case.  


Pursuant to its
powers under Executive Order No.1
[6]
 promulgated by then President
Corazon C. Aquino on 28 February 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) sequestered on 14 March 1986 the Eastern Telecommunications
Philippines, Inc. (ETPI).  Two months
later, the sequestration pertaining to 40% of the capital stock (Class âBâ
shares) owned by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., a foreign corporation, was
lifted.  It, however, remained in force
on the remaining 60% of the capital stock (Class âAâ shares) consisting of the
shares of Roberto S. Benedicto; Jose L. Africa; Polygon Investments &
Managers, Inc.; and Universal Molasses Corporation and all shares wherein the
late President Ferdinand E. Marcos was deemed the beneficial owner.
[7]


On 22 July 1987,
the PCGG filed with the Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 0009 for the reconveyance,
reversion, accounting, and restitution of the alleged ill-gotten ETPI shares,
and for damages.  


Then followed
various incidents, which this Court narrated in G.R. No. 83831; thus:


Subsequently, during the annual
stockholders meeting convened on January 29, 1988 pursuant to a PCGG Resolution
dated January 28, 1988 which called for the resumption of the stockholders
meeting originally scheduled on January 4, 1988, Eduardo M. Villanueva, as PCGG
nominee, Roman Mabanta, Jr. and Eduardo de los Angeles as nominees of the
foreign investors, Cable Wireless Ltd., and Jose L. Africa (who was absent)
were elected as members of the board of directors.


An organizational meeting was later
held where Eduardo Villanueva was elected as president and general manager,
while Ramon Desuasido, Almario Velasco and Ranulfo Payos were elected as acting
corporate secretary, acting treasurer, and acting assistant corporate
secretary, respectively.


The nomination and election of PCGG
nominees/designees to the ETPI Board of Directors, as well as the election of
its new officers, triggered a chain of contentious proceedings before the
Sandiganbayan and this Court between the members of the ETPI Board and its
stockholders, on the one hand, and the PCGGâs nominees/designees elected to the
ETPI Board, on the other hand, in the cases hereinunder discussed.


Victor Africa, who claims to be an
employee of ETPI holding the positions of vice-president, general counsel (on
official leave without pay), corporate secretary and special assistant to the
chairman (and president), filed directly with this Court on June 30, 1988 a
petition for injunction docketed as G.R. No. 83831, seeking to enjoin the PCGG
and its nominees/designees to the board of directors and the newly-installed
officers of ETPI from implementing their alleged illegal, invalid and immoral
act of ousting him from his offices and positions at the ETPI pending the
determination of whether they have validly, legally and morally assumed their
supposed positions and offices as "directors" and/or
"officers"â of ETPI.


He contends that the reasons
advanced by the PCGG-sponsored board of directors for ousting him from his
offices (redundancy, need to conserve company funds and loss of confidence) are
flimsy, whimsical and arbitrary, evidencing not only the PCGG-sponsored boardâs
discriminatory and oppressive attitude towards him but, more importantly, its
clear intent to harass him into refraining from questioning before several
tribunals all the invalid, illegal and immoral acts of said PCGG-sponsored
board which have caused and are still causing ETPI damages because they
constitute dissipation of assets.


Further claiming that the acts of
respondents will work injustice, unfairness and inequity to him as they will
invalidly, illegally and immorally deprive him of his principal means of
livelihood to the detriment of his spouse and three children, petitioner sought
the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining
order to enjoin the PCGG from ousting him from his positions and offices
effective June 30, 1988.


On July 8, 1988,
petitioner informed the Court that while a verbal agreement to maintain the 
status
quo
 was reached between petitionerâs lawyers, Attys. Juan de Ocampo and
Antonio Africa, and Messrs. Orlando Romero and Serafin Rivera of the PCGG,
respondent Eduardo M. Villanueva circulated on July 5, 1988 an inter-office
memorandum easing out the legitimate members of the board from their rooms in
the executive offices for the benefit of the newly-installed members of the
questioned PCGG board; and that Ildefonso Reynoso, vice-president for
administration, issued a memorandum to the Nival Security and Protective Agency
informing them that they were being relieved of their duty to provide security
services at the 7
th
 Floor of Telecoms Plaza where the
executive offices are located, which services would then be handled by the FCA
Security Agency.


On July 15, 1988,
petitioner was allegedly forcibly taken out of his office on the basis of a
PCGG order which petitioner claimed was addressed not to then PCGG Commissioner
Laureta but to three other PCGG officials, namely, Esteban B. Conejos, Jr.,
Serafin P. Rivera and Orlando Z. Romero.  As a consequence, petitioner Africa sought to have then Commissioner
Laureta declared in contempt of court for having committed âimproper conduct
tending directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct or degrade the
administration of justice.â  He likewise
sought the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction ordering
respondents to open his office and allow him access to and use of the same.
[8]


In the decision
of 9 January 1992,  we held that the
issues raised in G.R. No. 83831, as well as in the motion for contempt filed by
Eduardo Villanueva, were factual in nature and could be best ventilated before
the Sandiganbayan â âthe proper forum where both parties [could] substantiate
their respective claims.â  We then
referred the said case to the Sandiganbayan for appropriate proceedings and
ordered its consolidation with Civil Case No. 0009.  The said case was subsequently docketed as Civil Case No.
0146.  Thereafter, the petitioner
filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Sandiganbayan denied for lack of
merit.  


The private
respondents then filed their answer with counterclaim in Civil Case No.
0146.  They reiterated that the
petitioner was not a legitimate stockholder, but merely a dummy for the late
President Marcos; he was not, therefore, entitled to examine the corporate
records. 


In the 
interim
,
the petitioner filed separate motions, among which was for the production and
inspection of documents. 


In its
resolution
[9]
 of 10 January 1994, the
Sandiganbayan granted petitionerâs motion for the production and inspection of
documents pertaining to the transfer of ETPI shares to the private respondents,
including the  certificates of shares of
stock and the name, title, authority, and address of the person who entered the
changes in the stock and transfer book.  


Private
respondents De los Angeles and Mabanta thereafter filed an omnibus motion for a
reconsideration of the resolution and for the dismissal of Civil Case No.
0146.  They contended that in G.R. No.
83831 (now Civil Case No. 0146), this Court did not grant petitionerâs prayer
for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the PCGG and the new board of
directors and officers âfrom ousting the petitioner from his offices and
positions at ETPI and even from his room during the pendency of the
petition.â  They concluded that in the
absence of a restraining order, the petitioner was validly stripped off of his
positions, thereby rendering his petition moot and academic.  They also cited 
Africa v. PCGG
[10]
 
where this Court pronounced that they were elected as
nominees of the foreign investor Cable and Wireless, Ltd., owner of the Class
âBâ shares, which were outside the scope of sequestration.  They then argued that in light of this
Courtâs rulings in 
PCGG v. PeÃ±a
[11]
 
and 
San Miguel Corporation v. Khan
,
[12]
 the Sandiganbayan did not have
jurisdiction over them because the shares pertaining to them were neither
ill-gotten nor sequestered. 


The petitioner
opposed the omnibus motion because the validity of private respondentsâ
election as members of the board remained the principal issue of his petition
and their eventual replacement in the board did not absolve them from any
responsibility for acts committed during their term.


In reply, the
private respondents stressed that their vote as directors to oust the
petitioner from his positions and their right to sit as board members were
issues which were not in any way related to the sequestration or recovery of
ill-gotten wealth of which the Sandiganbayan exercises exclusive original
jurisdiction. 


In its
Resolution of 30 January 1996,
[13]
 the Sandiganbayan granted private
respondentsâ motion and dismissed Civil Case No. 0416. It ruled that the
petition for injunction was moot and academic and could no longer prosper,
since the act sought to be enjoined had already been consummated.  Besides, the Sandiganbayan had no
jurisdiction over respondents De los Angeles and Mabanta because their shares
were no longer covered by a writ of sequestration. Moreover, they were
eventually replaced by two British representatives.  


His motion for a
reconsideration of the resolution having been denied for lack of merit in the
resolution
[14]
of the Sandiganbayan of 29 March
1996, the petitioner filed this special civil action for 
certiorari 
under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court contending that


a.  The
Sandiganbayan acted 
in grave abuse of discretion
 when it dismissed the
case (ordered by this Honorable Court to be consolidated with SB Case No. 0009)
â¦ in lieu of taking the âappropriate proceedingsâ as directed by this Honorable
Court.


b.  The
Sandiganbayan acted in 
grave abuse of discretion 
  when it dismissed the case (even while it was
already conducting hearings in the other cases on the âsubstantially identicalâ
reliefs) â¦ instead of including the case in the said hearings.


c.  The
Sandiganbayan acted in 
grave abuse of discretion
 when it dismissed the
case (not only against the respondents Mabanta and De los Angeles who were no
longer ETPI directors, but also as against PCGG and the other non-PCGG
respondents) â¦ rather than just dropping the non-involved respondents and
continuing with the others.


d.  The
Sandiganbayan acted in 
grave abuse of discretion
 when it âfoundâ the
shares involved (of Mabanta and De los Angeles) not to be sequestered â¦
notwithstanding the absence of any document excluding them from the
sequestration previously imposed thereon by earlier documents.


On the other
hand, the private respondents allege that the dismissal of Civil Case No.
0416  was based on the evidence and law.
The original petition was in the nature of a preliminary prohibitory
injunction, and not a preliminary mandatory injunction as claimed by the
petitioner.  Since no injunction was
granted by this Court, petitionerâs ouster in 1988 became 
fait accompli
.



To refute
petitionerâs allegation that there was no evidence showing that their shares
were outside the scope of sequestration, the private respondents cite the PCGG
order of 14 May 1986, as well as the pronouncement of this Court in 
Africa
v. PCGG;
 thus:


The sequestration
of Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. is lifted. Henceforth, sequestration
is limited to the shares of Roberto S. Benedicto, Jose L. Africa, Polygon
Investments, Universal Molasses and all shares wherein Ferdinand E. Marcos is
the beneficial owner.
[15]


...


Shortly after the
PCGG sequestered ETPI on March 14, 1986, the sequestration order was partially
lifted in May 1986 when 40% of the shares of stock (Class âBâ) owned by the
Cable and Wireless, Ltd. were freed from the effects of sequestration.
[16]
 


Finally, the
private respondents cite anew the case of 
San Miguel Corporation v. Khan
,
[17]
 where we held that the
Sandiganbayan could not acquire jurisdiction over the suit involving the same
respondent Eduardo de los Angeles because the San Miguel shares of stock
pertaining to him were not sequestered. 


For its part,
the PCGG maintains that the Sandiganbayan properly dismissed Civil Case No.
0146 on the grounds that (1) the case had become moot and academic and (2) the
Sandiganbayan had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petition
insofar as private respondents Mabanta and De los Angeles were concerned.


As to the first,
the PCGG points out that the petitioner had long been ousted from his position
in ETPI and there was, therefore, nothing more to enjoin. His subsequent motion
for preliminary mandatory injunction praying that his office be opened for his
access and use was rendered nugatory by his ouster. 


As to the second
ground, the PCGG argues that in two resolutions,
[18]
 the Sandiganbayan consistently
ruled that the sequestration of ETPI was limited to Class âAâ shares, representing
the 60% Filipino-owned capital stock. The PCGG likewise confirms that in the
controversial annual stockholdersâ meeting on 29 January 1988 the PCGG did not
make any nomination pertaining to Class âBâ shares because it recognized that
said shares were not sequestered. Since then until the present, such fact has
remained.  


We dismiss the
petition.


First, the
petitioner pursued the wrong remedy.  Under Section 7 of P.D. No. 1606, as further amended by Section 3 of
R.A. No. 7975,
[19]
 petitionerâs remedy from the order
dismissing Civil Case No. 0146 was a petition for review under Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court.  Said Section 7
pertinently provides as follows:


SEC. 7.  
Form, Finality and Enforcement of Decisions
. â


...


Decisions and final orders of the
Sandiganbayan shall be appealable to the Supreme Court by petition for review
on 
certiorari
 raising pure questions of law in accordance with Rule 45
of the Rules of Court.


The
Sandiganbayanâs resolution of 30 January 1996 dismissing Civil Case No. 0146
was final in character in that it disposed of the action.
[20]
 Accordingly, the aggrieved party
could appeal therefrom by way of a petition for review under Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court pursuant to Sec. 7 of P.D. No. 1606 as further amended by R.A.
No. 7975.  


It is, of
course, settled that the special civil action for 
certiorari 
may be
resorted to even if the remedy of appeal is available provided that it is shown
that the appeal is inadequate, slow, insufficient, and will not promptly
relieve a party from the injurious effects of the order complained of, or where
the appeal is ineffective.
[21]
 In this case, the petitioner has
not convinced us at all that the regular appeal under Rule 45 of the Rules of
Court, as provided for in Section 7 of P.D. No. 1606 as further amended by R.A.
No. 7975, was inadequate, slow, insufficient, or ineffective.  Other than his bare, stereotyped allegation
in the petition that he had âno appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law,â which is even untrue since the remedy of
appeal was in fact allowed, the petitioner has nothing to offer to justify his
resort to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.


Even if it be
conceded, 
arguendo
, that the petitioner could properly avail of Rule 65,
the instant petition would still fail.  The assailed resolutions are not tainted with grave abuse of discretion.


We agree with
the Sandiganbayan that the petition for injunction had become moot and
academic. The remedy of injunction, specifically to prevent his ouster from his
positions, could no longer be entertained because the act sought to be
prevented had long been consummated.


Without doubt,
the said petition was precipitated by the letter
[22]
 dated 27 June 1988, which dismissed
the petitioner from his positions effective 30 June 1988.  The petition in G.R. No. 83831, which was
filed before this Court on 30 June 1988, sought the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to enjoin the PCGG and
the newly elected ETPI board members and officers from ousting the petitioner
from his positions at ETPI.  No
temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction was issued by
this Court.  Hence, he was effectively
removed from his positions.  Corollarily, his subsequent motion for a preliminary mandatory
injunction praying that the respondents be ordered to open his office and allow
him access to and use thereof  had no
leg to stand on. 


Neither is there
merit in petitionerâs argument that since this Court referred his original
petition (G.R. No. 83831) to the Sandiganbayan for appropriate proceedings the
Sandiganbayan should not have dismissed it. Such referral was made for the
Sandiganbayan to exercise its original jurisdiction and to determine the merits
of the issues raised by the parties, which were basically factual.  Thus, the said tribunal allowed the parties
to argue their positions, as indicated in the voluminous pleadings and motions
filed by them.  Hearings on certain
motions, including those filed by the petitioner, were conducted. It cannot,
therefore, be denied that the Sandiganbayan gave due consideration to the
petition and dismissed the same only after the parties were given sufficient
opportunity to ventilate their respective positions.


As to the issue
of the propriety of impleading private respondents De los Angeles and Mabanta,
the ruling of the Sandiganbayan must be sustained. It must be emphasized that
the private respondents were elected to the board of directors upon the
nomination of the foreign investor Cable and Wireless, Ltd.  At the time of the election, the Class âBâ
shares, which were owned by the said foreign corporation, were no longer under
sequestration. This was confirmed by the PCGG itself in its comment. Likewise,
the Sandiganbayan itself ruled, in its Resolutions of 11 May and 1 August 1995
in Civil Case No. 0009,
[23]
 that said Class âBâ shares were no
longer under sequestration. Conformably with our ruling in 
PCGG v. PeÃ±a
[24]
 
and 
San Miguel Corporation v. Kahn,
[25]
 the Sandiganbayan had no
jurisdiction over the said private respondents because the Class âBâ shares
pertaining to them were no longer covered by the writ of sequestration.  


Petitionerâs
submission that, if at all, the dismissal should have been limited only insofar
as private respondents De los Angeles and Mabanta were concerned is not
persuasive.  Again, the nature of the
petition was limited to the prevention of his ouster by the respondents as a
collegial body.  As earlier discussed,
the petition itself had become moot and academic, and its dismissal should
benefit all the respondents.


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the petition
is DISMISSED and the Resolutions of 30 January and 29 March 1996 of the
Sandiganbayan, Third Division, are AFFIRMED 
in toto
, with costs against
the petitioner.
