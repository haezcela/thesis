[ G.R. No. 112796, March 05, 1998 ]


TITO R. LAGAZO, PETITIONER,
VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND ALFREDO CABANLIT, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Where the acceptance of a donation was made in a separate
instrument but not formally communicated to the donor, may the donation be
nonetheless considered complete, valid and subsisting?  Where the deed of donation did not expressly
impose any burden -- the expressed consideration being purely one of liberality
and generosity -- but the recipient actually paid charges imposed on the
property like land taxes and installment arrearages, may the donation be deemed
onerous and thus governed by the law on ordinary contracts?


The Case


The Court answers these questions in the negative as it
resolves this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking
to set aside the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 in CA-GR CV No. 38050 promulgated
on November 29, 1993.  The assailed
Decision reversed the Regional Trial Court, Branch 30, Manila, in Civil Case
No. 87-39133 which had disposed
[3]
 of the controversy in favor of
herein petitioner in the following manner:
[4]


âWHEREFORE,
judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant
as follows:


1.  Ordering the defendant, or any person
claiming rights under him, to surrender to plaintiff possession of the premises
known as Lot 8w, Block 6, Psd-135534 of the Monserrat Estate, and the
improvement standing thereon, located at 3320 2nd St., V. Mapa, Old Sta. Mesa,
Manila;


2.
Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of Five Thousand (
P
5,000.00)
Pesos, as and for attorneyâs fees; and


3.  Costs against the defendant.


The
defendantâs counterclaims are hereby dismissed.â


The Facts


Although the legal conclusions and dispositions of the trial
and the appellate courts are conflicting, the factual antecedents of the case
are not substantially disputed.
[5]
 We reproduce their narration from
the assailed Decision:


âCivil
Case No. 83-39133 involves an action filed by plaintiff-appellee [herein
petitioner] on January 22, 1987 seeking to recover from defendant-appellant [a]
parcel of land which the former claims to have acquired from his grandmother by
donation.  Defendant-appellant [herein
private respondent], on the other hand, put up the defense that when the
alleged donation was executed, he had already acquired the property by a Deed
of Assignment from a transferee of plaintiff-appelleeâs grandmother.


The
evidence for plaintiff-appellee [herein petitioner] is summarized as follows:


Catalina
Jacob Vda. de Reyes, a widow and grandmother of plaintiff-appellee, was awarded
in July 1975 a 60.10-square meter lot which is a portion of the Monserrat
Estate, more particularly described as Lot 8W, Block 6 of Psd-135834, located
at 3320 2nd St., V. Mapa, Old Sta. Mesa, Manila.  The Monserrat Estate is a public land owned by the City of Manila
and distributed for sale to 
bona
 
fide
 tenants under its
land-for-the-landless program.  Catalina
Jacob constructed a house on the lot.


On
October 3, 1977, or shortly before she left for Canada where she is now a
permanent resident, Catalina Jacob executed a special power of attorney (Exh.
âAâ) in favor of her son-in-law Eduardo B. EspaÃ±ol authorizing him to execute
all documents necessary for the final adjudication of her claim as awardee of
the lot.


Due
to the failure of Eduardo B. EspaÃ±ol to accomplish the purpose of the power of
attorney granted to him, Catalina Jacob revoked said authority in an instrument
executed in Canada on April 16, 1984 (Exh. âDâ).  Simultaneous with the revocation, Catalina Jacob executed another
power of attorney of the same tenor in favor plaintiff-appellee.


On
January 30, 1985, Catalina Jacob executed in Canada a Deed of Donation over a
Lot 8W in favor of plaintiff-appellee (Exh. âEâ).  Following the donation, plaintiff-appellee checked with the
Register of Deeds and found out that the property was in the delinquent list,
so that he paid the installments in arrears and the remaining balance on the lot
(Exhs. âFâ, âF-1â and âF-2â) and declared the said property in the name of
Catalina Jacob (Exhs. âGâ, âG-1â, âG-2â and âG-3â).


On
January 29, 1986, plaintiff-appellee sent a demand letter to
defendant-appellant asking him to vacate the premises (Exh. âHâ).  A similar letter was sent by
plaintiff-appelleeâs counsel to defendant on September 11, 1986 (Exh.
âIâ).  However, defendant-appellant
refused to vacate the premises claiming ownership thereof.  Hence, plaintiff-appellee instituted the
complaint for recovery of possession and damages against defendant-appellant.


Opposing
plaintiff-appelleeâs version, defendant-appellant claimed that the house and
lot in controversy were his by virtue of the following documents:


1.
 
Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Catalina
Jacob dated October 7, 1977 in favor of Eduardo B. EspaÃ±ol covering the
residential house located at the premises (Exh. â4â).


2.
 
Deed of Assignment over Lot 8W executed by
Catalina Jacob in favor of Eduardo EspaÃ±ol dated September 30, 1980 (Exh. â5â);
and


3.
 
Deed of Assignment executed by Eduardo B.
EspaÃ±ol over Lot 8W and a residential house thereon in favor of
defendant-appellant dated October 2, 1982 (Exh. â6â).


After
trial, the lower court decided in favor of plaintiff-appellee and against
defendant-appellant, rationalizing that the version of the former is more
credible than that of the latter.  According to the lower court:


âFrom the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties[,]
it appears that the plaintiff- has a better right over the property, subject
matter of the case.  The version of the
plaintiff is more credible than that of the defendant.  The theory of the plaintiff is that the
house and lot belong to him by virtue of the Deed of Donation in his favor
executed by his grandmother Mrs. Jacob Vda. de Reyes, the real awardee of the
lot in question.  The defendantâs theory
is that he is the owner thereof because he bought the house and lot from
Eduardo EspaÃ±ol, after the latter had shown and given to him Exhibits 1, 4 and
5.  He admitted that he signed the Deed
of Assignment in favor of Eduardo EspaÃ±ol on September 30, 1980, but did not
see awardee Catalina Jacob Vda. de Reyes signed [sic] it.  In fact, the acknowledgement in Exhibit â5â
shows that the assignor/awardee did not appear before the notary public.  It may be noted that on said date, the
original awardee of the lot was no longer in the Philippines, as both parties
admitted that she had not come back to the Philippines since 1977.  (Exhs. K, K-1).  Defendant, claiming to be the owner of the lot, unbelievably did
not take any action to have the said house and lot be registered or had them
declared in his own name.  Even his
Exhibit 7 was not mailed or served to the addressee.  Such attitude and laxity is very unnatural for a buyer/owner of a
property, in stark contrast of [sic] the interest shown by the plaintiff who
saw to it that the lot was removed from the delinquent list for non-payment of
installments and taxes due thereto [sic].ââ
[6]


Ruling of the Appellate Court


In reversing the trial courtâs decision,
[7]
 Respondent Court of Appeals
anchored its ruling upon the absence of any showing that petitioner 
accepted

his grandmotherâs donation of the subject land.  Citing jurisprudence that the doneeâs failure to accept a
donation whether in the same deed of donation or in a separate instrument
renders the donation null and void, Respondent Court denied petitionerâs claim
of ownership over the disputed land.  The appellate court also struck down petitionerâs contention that the
formalities for a donation of real property should not apply to his case since
it was an onerous one -- he paid for the amortizations due on the land before
and after the execution of the deed of donation --  reasoning that the deed showed no burden, charge or condition
imposed upon the donee; thus, the payments made by petitioner were his
voluntary acts.


Dissatisfied with the foregoing ruling, petitioner now seeks
a favorable disposition from this Court.
[8]


Issues


Petitioner anchors his petition on the following grounds:
[9]


â[I.]  In reversing the decision of the trial
court, the Court of Appeals decided a question of substance in a way not in
accord with the law and applicable decisions of this Honorable Court.


[II.]  Even granting the correctness of the
decision of the Court of Appeals, certain fact and circumstances transpired in
the meantime which would render said decision manifestly unjust, unfair and
inequitable to petitioner.â


We believe that the resolution of this case hinges on the
issue of whether the donation was simple or onerous.


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition lacks merit.


Main
Issue:


Simple or Onerous
Donation?


At the outset, let us differentiate between a simple donation
and an onerous one.  A  simple  or  pure  donation  is  one whose cause is pure
liberality (no strings attached), while an onerous donation is one which is
subject to burdens, charges or future services equal to or more in value than
the thing donated.
[10]
 Under Article 733 of the Civil
Code, donations with an onerous cause shall be governed by the rules on
contracts; hence, the formalities required for a valid simple donation are not
applicable.


Petitioner contends that the burdens, charges or conditions
imposed upon a donation need not be stated on the deed of donation itself.  Thus, although the deed did not
categorically impose any charge, burden or condition to be satisfied by him,
the donation was onerous since he in fact and in reality paid for the
installments in arrears and for the remaining balance of the lot in
question.  Being an onerous donation,
his acceptance thereof may be express or implied, as provided under Art. 1320
of the Civil Code, and need not comply with the formalities required by Art.
749 of the same code.  His payment of
the arrearages and balance and his assertion of his right of possession against
private respondent clearly indicate his acceptance of the donation.


We rule that the donation was simple, not onerous.  Even conceding  that  petitionerâs  full  payment of the purchase price of the lot might have been a burden to
him, such payment was not however imposed by the donor as a condition for the
donation.  Rather, the deed explicitly
stated:


âThat for and in consideration of the love and affection
which the DONEE inspires in the DONOR, and as an act of liberality and
generosity and considering further that the DONEE is a grandson of the DONOR,
the DONOR hereby voluntarily and freely gives, transfer[s] and conveys, by way
of donation unto said DONEE, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns,
all the right, title and interest which the said DONOR has in the above
described real property, together with all the buildings and improvements found
therein, 
free from all lines [sic] and encumbrances and charges whatsoever
;â
[11]
 [underscoring supplied]


It is clear that the donor did not have any intention to
burden or charge petitioner as the donee.  The words in the deed are in fact typical of a pure donation.  We agree with Respondent Court that the
payments made by petitioner were merely his voluntary acts.  This much can be gathered from his testimony
in court, in which he never even claimed that a burden or charge had been
imposed by his grandmother.


âATTY FORONDA:


q
     
After
you have received this [sic] documents, the  x x x  revocation of power of
attorney and the Special Power of Attorney in your favor, what did you do?


WITNESS:


a
     
I
went here in City Hall and verif[ied] the status of the award of my
grandmother.


q
     
When
you say the award, are you referring to the award in particular [of the] lot in
favor of your grandmother?


a
     
Yes,
Sir.


q
     
What
was the result of your verification?


a
     
According
to the person in the office, the papers of my grandmother is [sic] includ[ed]
in the dilinquent [sic] list.


q
     
What
did you do then when you found out that the lot was includ[ed] in the
dilinquent [sic] list?


a
     
I
talked to the person in charged [sic] in the office and I asked him what to do so
that the lot should not [be] included in the dilinquent [sic] list.


ATTY. FORONDA:


q
     
And
what was the anwer [sic] given to you to the inquiry which you made?


WITNESS:


a
     
According
to the person in the office, that I would pay the at least [sic] one half of
the installment in order to take [out] the document [from] the delinquent list.


q
     
And
[were] you able to pay?


a
     
I
was able to pay, sir.


q
     
What
were you able to pay, one half of the balance or the entire amounts [sic]?


a
     
First,
I paid the [sic] one half of the balance since the time the lot was awarded to
us.


q
     
What
about the remaining balance, were you able to pay it?


a
     
I
was able to pay that, sir.


q
     
So,
as of now, the amount in the City of Manila of the lot has already been duly
paid, is it not?


a
    
Yes, sir.â
[12]


The payments even seem to have been made pursuant to the
power of attorney
[13]
executed by Catalina Reyes in favor
of petitioner, her grandson, authorizing him to execute acts necessary for the
fulfillment of her obligations.  Nothing
in the records shows that such acts were meant to be a burden in the donation.


As a pure or simple donation, the following provisions of
the Civil Code are applicable:


âArt.
734.  The donation is perfected from the
moment the donor knows of the acceptance by the donee.â


âArt.
746.  Acceptance must be made during the
lifetime of the donor and the donee.â


âArt.
749.  In order that the donation of an
immovable may be valid, it must be made in a public instrument, specifying
therein the property donated and the value of the charges which the donee must
satisfy.


The
acceptance may be made in the same deed of donation and in a separate public
document, but it shall not take effect unless it is done during the lifetime of
the donor.


If
the acceptance is made in a separate instrument, the donor shall be notified
thereof in authentic form, and this step shall be noted in both instruments.â


In the words of the esteemed Mr. Justice Jose C. Vitug,
[14]
 âLike any other contract, an
agreement of the parties is essential.  The donation, following the 
theory of cognition
 (Article 1319,
Civil Code), is perfected only upon the moment the donor knows of the
acceptance by the donee.â  Furthermore,
â[i]f the acceptance is made in a separate instrument, the donor shall be 
notified
thereof in an authentic form, 
and this step shall be noted in both
instruments.â
[15]


Acceptance of the donation by the donee is, therefore,
indispensable; its absence makes the donation null and void.
[16]
 The perfection and the validity of
a donation are well explained by former Sen. Arturo M. Tolentino in this wise:


âx x x  Title to immovable property does not pass
from the donor to the donee by virtue of a deed of donation until and unless it
has been accepted in a public instrument and the donor duly notified thereof.  The acceptance may be made in the very same
instrument of donation.  If the
acceptance does not appear in the same document, it must be made in
another.  Solemn words are not
necessary; it is sufficient if it shows the intention to accept.  But in this case it is necessary that formal
notice thereof be given to the donor, and the fact that due notice has been
given must be noted in both instruments (that containing the offer to donate
and that showing the acceptance).  Then
and only then is the donation perfected.  If the instrument of donation has been recorded in the registry of
property, the instrument that shows the acceptance should also be
recorded.  Where the deed of donation
fails to show the acceptance, or where the formal notice of the acceptance,
made in a separate instrument, is either not given to the donor or else not
noted in the deed of donation and in the separate acceptance, the donation is
null and void.â
[17]


Exhibit E (the deed of donation) does not show any
indication that petitioner-donee  accepted  the  gift.  During the trial, he did not present any instrument evidencing such
acceptance despite the fact that private respondent already raised this
allegation in his supplemental pleading
[18]
 to which petitioner raised no
objection.  It was only after the Court
of Appeals had rendered its decision, when petitioner came before this Court,
that he submitted an affidavit
[19]
 dated August 28, 1990, manifesting
that he âwholeheartedly acceptedâ the lot given to him by his grandmother,
Catalina Reyes.  This is too late,
because arguments, evidence, causes of action and matters not raised in the
trial court may no longer be raised on appeal.
[20]


True, the acceptance of a donation may be made at any time
during the lifetime of the donor.  And
granting 
arguendo
 that such acceptance may still  be  admitted  in evidence on appeal,
there  is  still need for  proof that
a formal notice of such acceptance was received by the donor and noted in both
the deed of donation and the separate instrument embodying the acceptance.  At the very least, this last legal requisite
of annotation in both instruments of donation and acceptance was not fulfilled
by petitioner.  For this reason, the
subject lot cannot be adjudicated to him.


Secondary
Issue:


Supervening Events


Petitioner also contends that certain supervening events
have transpired which render the assailed Decision âmanifestly unjust, unfair
and inequitableâ to him.  The City of
Manila has granted his request for the transfer to his name of the lot
originally awarded in favor of Catalina Reyes.  A deed of sale
[21]
 covering the subject lot has in
fact been executed between the City of Manila, as the vendor, and petitioner,
as the vendee.  The corresponding
certificate of title
[22]
 has also been issued in
petitionerâs name.


A close perusal of the city governmentâs resolution
[23]
 granting petitionerâs request
reveals that the request for and the grant of the transfer of the award were
premised on the validity and perfection of the deed of donation executed by the
original awardee, petitionerâs grandmother.  This is the same document upon which petitioner, as against private
respondent, asserts his right over the lot. But, as earlier discussed and
ruled, this document has no force and effect and, therefore, passes no title,
right or interest.  


Furthermore, the same resolution states:


âWHEREAS,
in a report submitted by Ms. [Menchu C.] Bello [, Special Investigator,] on
February 7, 1990, it is stated that  x x
x  constructed on the lot is a
make-shift structure used for residential purposes by the proposed transferee
Tito Lagazo and his family;  x x x  and that constructed at Lot 8, Block 6,
former Monserrat Estate is a make-shift structure used as a dwelling place by
Lagazo and family because the front portion of their house which was
constructed on a road lot was demolished, and the structure was extended
backward covering a portion of the old temporary road lot.  x x xâ


The above findings of the investigator are, however,
directly contradictory to the testimonies in court of petitioner himself and of
private respondent.  Petitioner claimed
the following:  that the house
constructed on the subject lot was owned by his grandmother Catalina Jacob;
that before the latter left for Canada in 1977, Eduardo EspaÃ±ol had already
been living in the same house and continued to do so until 1982; and that
private respondent occupied the premises after EspaÃ±ol left.
[24]
 On the other hand, private
respondent testified that he bought the subject house and lot from Eduardo
EspaÃ±ol in 1982, after which he and his family occupied the same; but sometime
in 1985, they had to leave the place due to a road-widening project which
reduced the house to âabout three meters [in] length and one arm[â]s width.â
[25]


Between the testimonies under oath of the contending parties
and the report -- not subjected to cross-examination -- which was prepared by
the investigator who recommended the approval of petitionerâs request for
transfer, it is the former to which the Court is inclined to give more
credence.  The investigatorâs report
must have been based on the misrepresentations of petitioner who arrogated unto
himself the prerogatives of both EspaÃ±ol and private respondent.  Further, it is on record that petitioner had
required private respondent to vacate the subject premises before he instituted
this complaint.  This shows he was not
in actual possession of the property, contrary to the report of the
investigator.


Cabanlitâs Claim of Ownership


Petitioner also assails Respondent Courtâs conclusion that
it is unnecessary to pass upon private respondentâs claim over the
property.  Petitioner insists that the
principal issue in the case, as agreed upon by the parties during pretrial, is
âwho between the parties is the owner of the house and lot in question.â


In disposing of the principal issue of the right of
petitioner over the subject property under the deed of donation, we arrive at
one definite conclusion:  on the basis
of the alleged donation, petitioner cannot be considered the lawful owner of
the subject property.  This does not
necessarily mean, however, that private respondent is automatically the
rightful owner.


In resolving private respondentâs claim of ownership, the
examination of the genuineness of the documents (deeds of assignment over the
lot between Catalina Reyes and Eduardo EspaÃ±ol and between EspaÃ±ol and private
respondent) upon which he asserts his right is necessary, especially in light
of petitionerâs allegations of forgery.  However, the respective assignors in both documents are not parties to
the instant case.  Not having been
impleaded in the trial court, they had no participation whatsoever in the
proceedings at bar.  Elementary norms of
fair play and due process bar us from making any disposition which may affect
their rights.  Verily, there can be no
valid judgment for or against them.
[26]


Anyhow, since petitioner, who was the plaintiff below,
failed to prove with clear and convincing evidence his ownership claim over the
subject property, the parties thus resume their 
status
 
quo ante.
  The trial court should have dismissed his
complaint for his failure to prove a right superior to that of private
respondent, but without prejudice to any action that Catalina Reyes or Eduardo
EspaÃ±ol or both may have against said private respondent.  Stating this point otherwise, we are not
ruling in this case on the rights and obligations between, on the one hand,
Catalina Reyes, her assigns and/or representatives; and, on the other, Private
Respondent Cabanlit.


Not having proven any right to a valid, just and demandable
claim that compelled him to litigate or to incur expenses in order to protect
his interests by reason of an unjustified act or omission of private
respondent, petitioner cannot be awarded attorneyâs fees.
