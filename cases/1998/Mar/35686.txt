UNITED PEPSI-COLA
SUPERVISORY UNION (UPSU), PETITIONER, VS. HON. BIENVENIDO E.
LAGUESMA AND PEPSI-COLA PRODUCTS, PHILIPPINES, INC. RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


Petitioner is a union
of supervisory employees.  It appears
that on March 20, 1995 the union filed a petition for certification election on
behalf of the route managers at Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc.  However, its petition was denied by the
med-arbiter and, on appeal, by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, on the
ground that the route managers are managerial employees and, therefore,
ineligible for union membership under the first sentence of Art. 245 of the
Labor Code, which provides:


Ineligibility of managerial
employees to join any labor organization; right of supervisory employees
. â Managerial employees are not eligible to join,
assist or form any labor organization.  Supervisory employees shall not be eligible for membership in a labor
organization of the rank-and-file employees but may join, assist or form
separate labor organizations of their own.


Petitioner
brought this suit challenging the validity of the order dated August 31, 1995,
as reiterated in the order dated September 22, 1995, of the Secretary of Labor
and Employment.  Its petition was
dismissed by the Third Division for lack of showing that respondent committed
grave abuse of discretion.  But
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, pressing for resolution its
contention that the first sentence of Art. 245 of the Labor Code, so far as it
declares managerial employees to be ineligible to form, assist or join unions,
contravenes Art. III Â§ 8 of the Constitution which provides:


The right of the people, including
those employed in the public and private sectors, to form unions, associations,
or societies for the purposes not contrary to law shall not be abridged.


For this reason, the petition was referred to the Court en banc.


The Issues in
this Case


Two question are
presented by the petition: (1) whether the route managers at Pepsi-Cola
Products Philippines, Inc. are managerial employees and (2) whether Art. 245,
insofar as it prohibits managerial employees from forming, joining or assisting
labor unions, violates Art. III, Â§ 8 of the Constitution.


In resolving
these issues it would be useful to begin by defining who are âmanagerial
employeesâ and considering the types of âmanagerial employees.â


Types of
Managerial Employees


The term
âmanagerâ generally refers to âanyone who is responsible for subordinates and
other organization resources.â
[1]
 As a class, managers constitute
three levels of a pyramid:


Top Management


_________________


Middle Management


_________________


First Line


Management


(
also called Supervisor)


____________________


____________________


Operatives


Or Operating Employees


FIRST-LINE MANAGERS â The lowest
level in an organization at which individuals are responsible for the work of
others is called 
first-line or first-level management
.  First-line managers direct operating
employees only; they do not supervise other managers.  
Example of first-line managers are the âforemanâ or production
supervisor in a manufacturing plant, the technical supervisor in a research
department, and the clerical supervisor in a large office.  First-level managers are often called
supervisors.


MIDDLE MANAGERS â The term 
middle
management 
can refer to more than one level in an organization.  Middle managers direct the activities of
other managers and sometimes also those of operating employees.  Middle managersâ principal responsibilities
are to direct the activities that implement their organizationsâ policies and
to balance the demands of their superiors with the capacities of their
subordinates.  
A plant manager in an
electronics firm is an example of a middle manager.


TOP MANAGERS â Composed of a
comparatively small group of executives, 
top management 
  is responsible for the overall management of
the organization.  It establishes
operating policies and guides the organizationâs interactions with its
environment. 
  Typical titles of top
managers are âchief executive officer,â âpresident,â and âsenior
vice-president.â
  Actual titles vary
from one organization to another and are not always a reliable guide to
membership in the highest management classification.
[2]


As can be seen
from this description, a distinction exist between those who have the authority
to devise, implement and control strategic and operational policies (top and
middle managers) and those whose task is simply to ensure that such polices are
carried out by the rank-and-file employees of an organization (first-level
managers/supervisors).  What
distinguishes them from the rank-and file employees is that they act in the
interest of the employer in supervising such rank-and-file employees.


âManagerial
employeesâ may therefore be said to fall into two distinct categories: the
âmanagersâ 
per se
, who compose the former group described above, and the
âsupervisorsâ who form the latter group.  Whether they belong to the first or second category, managers, vis-Ã -vis
employers, are, likewise, employees.
[3]


The first
question is whether route managers are managers are managerial employees or
supervisors.


Previous
Administrative Determinations of the Question Whether Route Managers are
Managerial Employees


It appears that
this question was the subject of two previous determinations by the Secretary
of Labor and Employment, in accordance with which this case was decided by the
med-arbiter.


In Case
 
No.
OS-MA-10318-91, entitled
 
Workersâs Alliance Trade Union (WATU) v.
Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc., decided on November 13, 1991, the
Secretary of Labor found:


We examined carefully the pertinent
job description of the subject employees and other documentary evidence on
record vis-Ã -vis paragraph (m), Article 212 of the Labor Code, as amended, and
we find that only those employees occupying the position of route manager and
accounting manager are managerial employees.  The rest i.e. quality control manager, yard/transport manager and
warehouse operations manager are supervisory employees.


To qualify as managerial employee,
there must be a clear showing of the exercise of managerial attributes under
paragraph (m), Article 212 of the Labor Code as amended.  Designations or titles of positions are not
controlling.  In the instant case,
nothing on record will support the claim that the quality control manager,
yard/transport manager and warehouse operations manager are vested with said
attributes.  The warehouse operations
manager, for example, merely assists the plant finance manager in planning,
organizing, directing and controlling all activities relative to development
and implementation of an effective management control information system at the
sale offices.  The exercise of authority
of the quality control manager, on the other hand, needs the concurrence of the
manufacturing manager


As to the route managers and
accounting manager, we are convinced that they are managerial employees.  Their job descriptions clearly reveal so.


On July 6, 1992,
this finding was reiterated in Case No. OS-A-3-71-92, entitled In Re:  Petition for Direct Certification and/or
Certification Election-Route Managers/Supervisory Employees of Pepsi-Cola
Products Phils. Inc., as follows:


The issue brought before us is not
of first impression.  At one time, we
had the occasion to rule upon the status of route manager in the same company
vis a vis the issue as to whether or not it is supervisory employee or a
managerial employee.  In the case of 
Workers
Alliance Trade Unions (NATU) vs. Pepsi Cola Products, Phils., Inc.

(OS-MA-A-10-318-91), 15 November 1991, we ruled that a route manager is a
managerial employee within the context of the definition of the law, and hence,
ineligible to join, form or assist a union. We have once more passed upon the
logic of our Decision aforecited in the light of the issues raised in the
instant appeal, as well as the available documentary evidence on hand, and have
come to the view that there is no cogent reason to depart from our earlier
holding.  Route Managers are, by the
very nature of their functions and the authority they wield over their
subordinates, managerial employees.  The
prescription found in Art. 245 of the Labor Code, as amended therefore, clearly
applies to them.
[4]
4


Citing our ruling
in Nasipit Lumber Co. v. National Labor Relations Commission,
[5]
5 however, petitioner argues that
these previous administrative determinations do not have the effect of  
res judicata
 in this case, because
"labor relations proceedings" are "non-litigious and summary in
nature without regard to legal technicalities."
[6]
 Nasipit Lumber Co. involved a
clearance to dismiss an employee issued by the Department of Labor.  The question was whether in a subsequent
proceeding for illegal dismissal, the clearance was 
res judicata
.  In holding it was not, this Court made it
clear that it was referring to labor relations proceedings of a non-adversary
character, thus:


The requirement of a clearance to
terminate employment was a creation of the Department of labor to carry out the
Labor Code provisions on security of tenure and termination of employment.  The proceeding subsequent to the filing of
an application for clearance to terminate employment was outlined in Book V,
Rule XIV of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code.  The fact that said rule allowed a procedure
for the approval of the clearance with or without the opposition of the
employee concerned (Secs. 7 & 8), demonstrates the non-litigious and summary
nature of the proceeding.  The clearance
requirement was therefore necessary only as an expeditious shield against
arbitrary dismissal without the knowledge and supervision of the Department of
Labor.  Hence, a duly approved clearance
implied that the dismissal was legal or for cause (Sec. 2).
[7]
v.
 National
Labor Relations Commission, 177 SCRA 93, 100 (1989).7


But the doctrine
of 
res judicata
 certainly applies to adversary administrative
proceedings.  As early as 1956, in
Brillantes v. Castro,
[8]
8  we sustained the dismissal of an action by a trial court on the basis of
a prior administrative determination of the same case by the Wage
Administration Service, applying the principle of 
res judicata
.  Recently, in Abad v. NLRC
[9]
9 we applied the related doctrine of
stare decisis in holding that the prior determination that certain jobs at the
Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co. were project employments was binding in another
case involving another group of employees of the same company.  Indeed, in Nasipit Lumber Co., this Court
clarified toward the end of its opinion that "the doctrine of 
res
judicata
 applies . . . to judicial or quasi judicial proceedings and not to
the exercise of administrative powers."
[10]
v.
 National Labor Relations Commission, 
supra

note 7.10  Now proceedings for
certification election, such as those involved in Case No. OS-M-A-10-318-91 and
Case No. OS-A-3-71-92, are quasi judicial in nature and, therefore, decisions
rendered in such proceedings can attain finality.
[11]
v.
 B.F. Goodrich (Marikina Factory) Confidential and
Salaries Employees Union-NATU, 49 SCRA 532 (1973).11


Thus, we have in
this case an expert's view that the employees concerned are managerial
employees within the purview of Art. 212 which provides:


(m)
          
"managerial
employee" is one who is vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and
execute management policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall,
discharge, assign or discipline employees.  Supervisory employees are those who, in the interest of the employer,
effectively recommend such managerial actions if the exercise of such authority
is not merely routinary or clerical in nature but requires the use of
independent judgment.  All employees not
falling within any of the above definitions are considered rank-and-file employees
for purposes of this Book.


At the very least, the principle of finality of administrative
determination compels respect for the finding of the Secretary of Labor that
route managers are managerial employees as defined by law in the absence of
anything to show that such determination is without substantial evidence to
support it. Nonetheless, the Court, concerned that employees who are otherwise
supervisors may wittingly or unwittingly be classified as managerial personnel
and thus denied the right of self- organization, has decided to review the
record of this case.


DOLE's Finding
that  Route Managers are Managerial
Employees Supported by Substantial Evidence in the Record 


The Court now
finds that the job evaluation made by the Secretary of Labor is indeed
supported by substantial evidence.    The nature of the job of route managers is
given in a four-page pamphlet, prepared by the company, called "Route
Manager Position Description,"  the
pertinent parts of which read:

Earlier in this
opinion, reference was made to the distinction between managers 
per se 
(top
managers and middle managers) and supervisors (first-line managers).  That distinction is evident in the work of
the route managers which sets them apart from supervisors in general.  Unlike supervisors who basically merely
direct operating employees in line with set tasks assigned to them, route
managers are responsible for the success of the company's main line of business
through management of their respective sales teams.  Such management necessarily involves the planning, direction,
operation and evaluation of their individual teams and areas which  the work of supervisors does not entail. 


The route
managers cannot thus possibly be classified as mere supervisors because their
work does not only involve, but goes far beyond, the simple direction or
supervision of operating employees to accomplish objectives set by those above
them.  They are not mere functionaries
with simple oversight functions but business administrators in their own
right.  An idea of the role of route
managers as managers 
per se
 can be gotten from a memo sent by the
director of metro sales operations of respondent company to one of the route
managers.  It reads:
[13]

Let me remind you that for our operations to be
profitable, we have to sustain the intensity and momentum that your group and
yourself have shown last March.  You
just have to 
deliver the desired volume targets, better negotiated
concessions, rationalized sustaining deals, eliminate or reduced overdues,
improved collections, more cash accounts, controlled operating expenses,

etc.  Also, based on the agreed set
targets, your monthly performance will be closely monitored.


You have proven in the past that your capable of
achieving your targets thru better planning, managing your group as a fighting
team, and thru aggressive selling.  I am
looking forward to your success and I expect that you just have to exert your
doubly best in turning around our operations from a losing to a profitable one!


Happy Selling!!

The plasticized
card given to route managers, quoted in the separate opinion of  Justice Vitug, although entitled "RM's
Job Description," is only a summary of performance standards. It does not
show whether route managers are managers 
per se
 or supervisors.
Obviously, these performance standards have to be related to the specific tasks
given to route managers in the four-page "Route Manager Position
Description," and, when this is done, the managerial nature of their jobs
is fully revealed.  Indeed, if any, the
card indicates the great latitude and discretion given to route managers - from
servicing and enhancing company goodwill to supervising and auditing accounts,
from trade (new business) development to the discipline, training and
monitoring of performance of their respective sales teams, and so forth, - if
they are to fulfill the company's expectations in the "key result
areas."  


Article 212(m)
says that "supervisory employees are those who, in the interest of the
employer, effectively recommend such managerial actions if the exercise of such
authority is not merely routinary or clerical in nature but requires the use of
independent judgment."  Thus, their
only power is to recommend.  Certainly,
the route managers in this case more than merely recommend effective management
action.  They perform operational, human
resource, financial and marketing functions for the company, all of which
involve the laying down of operating policies for themselves and their teams.
For example, with respect to marketing, route managers, in accordance with
B.1.1.1 to B.1.1.9 of the Route Managers Job Description, are charged, among
other things, with expanding the dealership base of their respective sales
areas, maintaining the goodwill of current dealers, and distributing the
company's various promotional items as they see fit.  It is difficult to see how supervisors can be given such
responsibility when this involves not just the routine supervision of operating
employees but the protection and expansion of the company's business vis-a-vis
its competitors.


While route
managers do not appear to have the power to hire and fire people (the evidence
shows that they only "recommended" or "endorsed" the taking
of disciplinary action against certain employees), this is because this is a
function of the Human Resources or Personnel Department of the company.
[14]
14  And neither should it be presumed that just because they are given set
benchmarks to observe, they are 
ipso facto
 supervisors.  Adequate control methods (as embodied in
such concepts as "Management by Objectives [MBO]" and
"performance appraisals") which require a  delineation of the functions and responsibilities of managers by
means of ready reference cards as here, have long been recognized in management
as effective tools for keeping businesses competitive.


This brings us
to the second question, whether the first sentence of Art. 245 of the Labor
Code, prohibiting managerial employees from forming, assisting or joining any labor
organization, is constitutional in light of Art. III, Â§8 of the Constitution
which provides:


The right of the people, including
those employed in the public and private sectors, to form unions, associations,
or societies for purposes not contrary to law shall not be abridged.


As already
stated, whether they belong to the first category (managers 
per se
) or
the second category (supervisors), managers are employees.  Nonetheless, in the United States, as
Justice Puno's separate opinion notes, supervisors have no right to form
unions.  They are excluded from the
definition of the term "employee" in Â§2(3) of the Labor-Management
Relations Act of 1947.
[15]
v. 
Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 281, n
11, 40 L.Ed.2d 134, 147, n. 11 (1974), thus:


Supervisors are management
people.  They have distinguished
themselves in their work.  They have
demonstrated their ability to take care of themselves without depending upon
the pressure of collective action.  No
one forced them to become supervisors.  They abandoned the "collective security" of the rank and file
voluntarily, because they believed the opportunities thus opened to them to be
more valuable to them than such "security".  It seems wrong, and it is wrong, to subject people of this kind,
who have demonstrated their initiative, their ambition and their ability to get
ahead, to the leveling processes of seniority, uniformity and standardization
that the Supreme Court recognizes as being fundamental principles of
unionism.  (J.I. Case Co. 
v.

National Labor Relations Board, 321 U.S. 332, 88 L.Ed. 762, 64 S. Ct. 576
(1994).  It is wrong for the foremen,
for it discourages the things in them that made them foremen in the first
place.  For the same reason, that it
discourages those best qualified to get ahead, it is wrong for industry, and
particularly for the future strength and productivity of our country.
15  In the Philippines, the question whether managerial employees have a
right of self-organization has arisen with respect to first-level managers or
supervisors, as shown by a review of the course of labor legislation in this
country.  


Right of
Self-Organization of Managerial Employees under Pre-Labor Code Laws


Before the
promulgation of the Labor Code in 1974, the field of labor relations was
governed by the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. No. 875).


In accordance
with the general definition above, this law defined "supervisor" as
follows:


SECTION  2.  . . . 


(k) "Supervisor" means
any person having authority in the interest of an employer, to hire, transfer,
suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign, recommend, or discipline other
employees, or responsibly to direct them, and to adjust their grievances, or
effectively to recommend such acts, if, in connection with the foregoing, the
exercise of such authority is not of a merely routinary or clerical nature but
requires the use of independent judgment.
[16]
16


The right of
supervisors to form their own organizations was affirmed:  


SEC.  3.  
Employees' Right to
Self-Organization
. -- Employees shall have the right to self-organization
and to form, join or assist labor organizations of their own choosing for the
purpose of collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing
and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining
and other mutual aid and protection. Individuals employed as supervisors shall
not be eligible for membership in a labor organization of employees under their
supervision but may form separate organizations of their own.
[17]


For its part, the Supreme Court upheld in several of its decisions the
right of supervisors to organize for purposes of labor relations.
[18]
v.
 Filoil Supervisory and Confidential Employees
Association, 6 SCRA 522 (1972); Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Manila Railroad
Co. 
v.
 CIR, 106 Phil 607 (1959).18


Although it had
a definition of the term "supervisor," the Industrial Peace Act did
not define the term "manager." But, using the commonly-understood
concept of "manager," as above stated, it is apparent that the law
used the term "supervisors" to refer to the sub-group of
"managerial employees" known as front-line managers. The other
sub-group of "managerial employees," known as managers 
per se
,
was not covered.


However, in
Caltex Filipino Managers and Supervisors Association v. Court of Industrial
Relations,
[19]
J.
)19  the right
of all managerial employees to self-organization was upheld as a general
proposition, thus: 


It would be going too far to dismiss
summarily the point raised by respondent Company - that of the alleged identity
of interest between the managerial staff and the employing firm.  That should ordinarily be the case,
especially so where the dispute is between management and the rank and
file.  It does not necessarily follow
though that what binds the managerial staff to the corporation forecloses the
possibility of conflict between them.  There could be a real difference between what the welfare of such group
requires and the concessions the firm is willing to grant.  Their needs might not be attended to then in
the absence of any organization of their own. Nor is this to indulge in empty
theorizing.  The record of respondent
Company, even the very case cited by it, is proof enough of their uneasy and
troubled relationship.  Certainly the
impression is difficult to  erase that
an alien firm failed to manifest sympathy for the claims of its Filipino
executives.  To predicate under such
circumstances that agreement inevitably marks their relationship, ignoring that
discord would not be unusual, is to fly in the face of reality.


. . .  The basic question is whether the managerial personnel can
organize.  What respondent Company
failed to take into account is that the right to self-organization is not
merely a statutory creation.  It is
fortified by our Constitution.  All are
free to exercise such right unless their purpose is contrary to law.  Certainly it would be to attach unorthodoxy
to, not to say an emasculation of, the concept of law if managers as such were
precluded from organizing.  Having done
so and having been duly registered, as did occur in this case, their union is
entitled to all the rights under Republic Act No.  875.  Considering what is
denominated as unfair labor practice under Section 4 of such Act and the facts
set forth in our decision, there can be only one answer to the objection raised
that no unfair labor practice could be committed by respondent Company insofar
as managerial personnel is concerned.  It is, as is quite obvious, in the negative.

Right of
Self-Organization of Managerial Employees under the Labor Code


Thus, the dictum
in the Caltex case which allowed at least for the theoretical unionization of
top and middle managers by assimilating them with the supervisory group under
the broad phrase "managerial personnel," provided the lynchpin for
later laws denying the right of self-organization not only to top and middle
management employees but to front line managers or supervisors as well.  Following the Caltex case, the Labor Code,
promulgated in 1974 under martial law, dropped the distinction between the
first and second sub-groups of managerial employees.  Instead of treating the terms "supervisor" and
"manager" separately, the law lumped them together and called them "managerial
employees," as follows:


ART.  212.  
Definitions
 .
. . . 


(k) "Managerial Employee"
is one who is vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and execute
management policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall,
discharge, assign or discipline employees, or to effectively recommend such managerial
actions. All employees not falling within this definition are considered rank
and file employees for purposes of this Book.
[22]
22


The definition shows that it is actually a combination of the commonly
understood definitions of both groups of managerial employees, grammatically
joined by the phrase "and/or."


This general
definition was perhaps legally necessary at that time for two reasons. First,
the 1974 Code denied supervisors their right to self-organize as theretofore
guaranteed to them by the Industrial Peace Act.  Second, it stood the dictum in the Caltex case on its head by
prohibiting all types of managers from forming unions. The explicit general
prohibition was contained in the then Art. 246 of the Labor Code.


The practical
effect of this synthesis of legal concepts was made apparent in the Omnibus
Rules Implementing the Labor Code which the Department of Labor promulgated on
January 19, 1975.  Book V, Rule II,  Â§11 of the Rules provided:


Supervisory unions and unions of
security guards to cease operation.

- All existing supervisory unions and unions of security guards shall, upon the
effectivity of the Code, cease to operate as such and their registration
certificates shall be deemed automatically cancelled.  However, existing collective agreements with such unions, the
life of which extends beyond the date of effectivity of the Code, shall be
respected until their expiry date insofar as the economic benefits granted
therein are concerned.


Members of supervisory unions who
do not fall within the definition of managerial employees shall become eligible
to join or assist the rank and file labor organization, and if none exists, to
form or assist in the forming of such rank and file organization.  The determination of who are managerial
employees and who are not shall be the subject of negotiation between
representatives of the supervisory union and the employer.  If no agreement is reached between the
parties, either or both of them may bring the issue to the nearest Regional
Office for determination.


The Department
of Labor continued to use the term "supervisory unions" despite the
demise of the legal definition of "supervisor" apparently because
these were the unions of front line managers which were then allowed as a
result of the statutory grant of the right of self-organization under the
Industrial Peace Act.  Had the
Department of Labor seen fit to similarly ban unions of top and middle managers
which may have been formed following the dictum in Caltex, it obviously would
have done so.  Yet it did not,
apparently because no such unions of top and middle managers really then
existed.  


Real Intent of
the 1986 Constitutional Commission


This was the law
as it stood at the time the Constitutional Commission  considered the draft of Art. III, Â§8.  Commissioner Lerum sought to amend the draft of what was later to
become Art. III, Â§8 of the present Constitution:


MR. LERUM.  My amendment is on Section 7, page 2, line
19, which is to insert between the words "people" and "to"
the following:  WHETHER EMPLOYED BY THE
STATE OR PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS.  In
other words, the section will now read as follows:  "The right of the people WHETHER EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OR
PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS to form associations, unions, or societies for purposes
not contrary to law shall not be abridged."
[23]
23


Explaining his proposed amendment, he stated:


MR. LERUM.  Under the 1935 Bill of Rights, the right to
form associations is granted to all persons whether or not they are employed in
the government.  Under that provision, we
allow unions in the government, in government-owned and controlled corporations
and in other industries in the private sector, such as the Philippine
Government Employees' Association, unions in the GSIS, the SSS, the DBP and
other government-owned and controlled corporations.  
Also, we have unions of supervisory employees and of security
guards.  But what is tragic about this
is that after the 1973 Constitution was approved and in spite of an express
recognition of the right to organize in P.D. No. 442, known as the Labor Code,
the right of government workers, supervisory employees and security guards to
form unions was abolished.


And we have been fighting
against this abolition
.  In every tripartite conference attended by
the government, management and workers, we have always been insisting on the
return of these rights.  However, both
the government and employers opposed our proposal, so nothing came out of this
until this week when we approved a provision which states:


Notwithstanding any provision of
this article, the right to self-organization shall not be denied to government
employees.


We are afraid that without any
corresponding provision covering the private sector, the security guards, the
supervisory employees or majority employees [
sic
] will still be
excluded, and that is the purpose of this amendment.


I will be very glad to accept any
kind of wording as long as it will amount to absolute recognition of private
sector employees, without exception, to organize.


THE PRESIDENT.  What does the Committee say?


FR. BERNAS.  Certainly, the sense is very acceptable, but
the point raised by Commissioner Rodrigo is well-taken.  Perhaps, we can lengthen this a little bit
more to read:  "The right of the
people WHETHER UNEMPLOYED OR EMPLOYED BY STATE OR PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS."


I want to avoid also the
possibility of having this interpreted as applicable only to the employed.


MR. DE LOS REYES.  Will the proponent accept an amendment to
the amendment, Madam President?


MR. LERUM.  Yes, as long as it will carry the idea that
the right of the employees in the private sector is recognized.
[24]


Lerum thus
anchored his proposal on the fact that (1) government employees, supervisory
employees, and security guards, who had the right to organize under the
Industrial Peace Act,  had been denied
this right by the Labor Code, and  (2)
there was a need to reinstate the right of these employees.  In consonance with his objective to
reinstate the right of government, security, and supervisory employees  to organize, Lerum then made his proposal:


MR. LERUM.  Mr. Presiding Officer, after a consultation
with several Members of this Commission, my amendment will now read as
follows:  "The right of the people
INCLUDING THOSE EMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS to form
associations, unions, or societies for purposes not contrary to law shall not
be abridged.  
In proposing that
amendment
 I ask to make of record that I want the following provisions of
the Labor Code to be automatically abolished, which read:


ART.  245.  Security guards and
other personnel employed for the protection and security of the person,
properties and premises of the employers shall not be eligible for membership
in a labor organization.


ART.  246.  Managerial employees
are not eligible to join, assist, and form any labor organization.


THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
Bengzon).  What does the Committee say?


FR. BERNAS.  The Committee accepts.


THE PRESIDING OFFICER.  (Mr. Bengzon)  The Committee has accepted the amendment, as amended.


Is there any objection?  (
Silence
)  The Chair hears none; the amendment, as amended, is approved.
[25]


The question is
what Commissioner Lerum meant in seeking to "automatically abolish"
the then Art. 246 of the Labor Code.  Did he simply want  "any
kind of wording as long as it will amount to absolute recognition of private
sector employees, without exception, to organize"?
[26]
 Or, did he instead intend to have
his words taken in the context of the cause which moved him to propose the
amendment in the first place, namely, the denial of the right of supervisory
employees to organize, because he said, "We are afraid that without any
corresponding provision covering the private sector, security guards,
supervisory employees or majority [of] employees will still be excluded, and
that is the purpose of this amendment"?
[27]


It would seem
that Commissioner Lerum simply meant to restore the right of supervisory
employees to organize.  For even though
he spoke of the need to "abolish" Art. 246 of the Labor Code which,
as already stated, prohibited "managerial employees" in general from
forming unions, the fact was that in explaining his proposal, he repeatedly
referred to "supervisory employees" whose right  under the Industrial Peace Act to organize
had been taken away by Art. 246.  It is
noteworthy that Commissioner Lerum never referred to the then definition of
"managerial employees" in Art. 212(m) of the Labor Code which put
together, under the broad phrase "managerial employees,"  top and middle managers and
supervisors.  Instead, his repeated use
of the term "supervisory employees," when such term then was no
longer in the statute books, suggests a frame of mind that remained grounded in
the language of the Industrial Peace Act.  


Nor did Lerum
ever refer to the dictum in Caltex recognizing the right of all managerial
employees to organize, despite the fact that the Industrial Peace Act did not
expressly provide for the right of top and middle managers to organize.  If Lerum was aware of the Caltex dictum,
then his insistence on the use of the term "supervisory employees"
could only mean that he was excluding other managerial employees from his
proposal.  If, on the other hand, he was
not aware of the Caltex statement sustaining the right to organize to top and middle
managers, then the more should his repeated use of the term "supervisory
employees" be taken at face value,  as  it had been defined in the
then Industrial Peace Act.  


At all events,
that the rest of the Commissioners understood his proposal to refer solely to
supervisors and not to other managerial employees is clear from the following
account of Commissioner Joaquin G. Bernas, who writes:  


In presenting the modification on
the 1935 and 1973 texts, Commissioner Eulogio R. Lerum explained that the
modification included three categories of workers:  (1) government employees, (2) supervisory employees, and (3)
security guards. Lerum made of record the explicit intent to repeal provisions
of P.D. 442, the Labor Code. The provisions referred to were:


ART.  245.  Security guards and other
personnel employed for the protection and security of the person, properties
and premises of the employers shall not be eligible for membership in a labor
organization.


ART.  246.  Managerial employees
are not eligible to join, assist, and form any labor organization.
[28]
28


Implications of
the Lerum Proposal


In sum, Lerum's
proposal to amend Art. III, Â§8 of the draft Constitution by including labor
unions in the guarantee of organizational right should be taken in the context
of statements that his aim was the removal of the statutory ban against
security guards and supervisory employees joining labor organizations.  The approval by the Constitutional
Commission of his proposal can only mean, therefore, that the Commission
intended the absolute right to organize of government workers, supervisory
employees, and security guards to be constitutionally guaranteed. By
implication, no similar absolute constitutional right to organize for labor
purposes should be deemed to have been granted to top-level and middle
managers.  As to them the right of
self-organization may be regulated and even abridged conformably to Art. III,
Â§8. 


Constitutionality
of Art. 245 


Finally, the
question is whether the present ban against managerial employees, as embodied
in Art. 245  (which superseded Art. 246)
of the Labor Code,  is valid.  This provision  reads:


ART.  245. 
Ineligibility of managerial employees to join any labor
organization; right of supervisory employees.
 - Managerial employees are
not eligible to join, assist or form any labor organization.  Supervisory employees shall not be eligible
for membership in a labor organization of the rank-and-file employees but may
join, assist or form separate labor organizations of their own.
[29]
29


This provision
is the result of the amendment of the Labor Code in 1989 by R.A. No. 6715,
otherwise known as the Herrera-Veloso Law.  Unlike the Industrial Peace Act or the provisions of the Labor Code
which it superseded, R.A. No. 6715 provides separate definitions of the terms
"managerial" and "supervisory employees," as follows:


ART.  212.  
Definitions
.
. . .


(m)
          
"managerial
employee" is one who is vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down 
and

execute management policies and/or to hire transfer, suspend, lay off, recall,
discharge, assign or discipline employees.  Supervisory employees are those who, in the interest of the employer,
effectively recommend such managerial actions if the exercise of such authority
is not merely routinary or clerical in nature but requires the use of independent
judgment.  All employees not falling
within any of the above definitions are considered rank-and-file employees for
purposes of this Book.


Although the
definition of "supervisory employees" seems to have been unduly
restricted to the last phrase of the definition in the Industrial Peace Act,
the legal significance given to the phrase "effectively recommends"
remains the same.  In fact, the
distinction between top and middle managers, who set management policy, and
front-line supervisors, who are merely responsible for ensuring that such
policies are carried out by the rank and file, is articulated in the present
definition.
[30]
30  When read in relation to this definition in Art. 212(m), it will be seen
that Art. 245 faithfully carries out the intent of the Constitutional
Commission in framing Art. III, Â§8 of the fundamental law.  


Nor is the
guarantee of organizational right in Art. III, Â§8 infringed by a ban against
managerial employees forming a union.  The right guaranteed in Art. III, Â§8 is subject to the condition that
its exercise should be for purposes "not contrary to law."  In the case of Art. 245, there is a rational
basis for prohibiting managerial employees from forming or joining labor
organizations.  As Justice Davide, Jr.,
himself a constitutional commissioner, said in his 
ponencia
 in Philips
Industrial Development, Inc. v. NLRC:
[31]
31


In the first place, all these
employees, with the exception of the service engineers and the sales force
personnel, are confidential employees.  Their classification as such is not seriously disputed by PEO-FFW; the
five (5) previous CBAs between PIDI and PEO-FFW explicitly considered them as
confidential employees. By the very nature of their functions, they assist and
act in a confidential capacity to, or have access to confidential matters of,
persons who exercise managerial functions in the field of labor relations.  As such, the rationale behind the
ineligibility of managerial employees to form, assist or joint a labor union
equally applies to them.


In 
Bulletin Publishing Co., Inc.
v. Hon. Augusto Sanchez
, this Court elaborated on this rationale, thus:


". . . The rationale for this
inhibition has been stated to be, because if these managerial employees would
belong to or be affiliated with a Union, the latter might not be assured of
their loyalty to the Union in view of evident conflict of interests.  The Union can also become company-dominated
with the presence of managerial employees in Union membership."
[32]


To be sure, the
Court in Philips Industrial was dealing with the right of confidential
employees to organize.  But the same
reason for denying them the right to organize justifies even more the ban on
managerial employees from forming unions.  After all, those who qualify as top or middle managers are executives
who receive from their employers information that not only is confidential but
also is not generally available to the public, or to their competitors, or to
other employees. It is hardly necessary to point out that to say that the first
sentence of Art. 245 is unconstitutional would be to contradict the decision in
that case.

: J. Davide's Opinion








CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION


DAVIDE, JR., 
J
.:


I concur with
the majority that the "route managers" of private respondent
Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. are managerial employees.  However, I respectfully submit that contrary
to the majority's holding, Article 245 of the Labor Code is unconstitutional,
as it abridges Section 8, Article III of the Constitution.


Section 8,
Article III of the 1987 Constitution was taken from Section 7, Article IV of
the 1973 Constitution which, in turn, was lifted from Section 6, Article III of
the 1935 Constitution.  Section 7 of the
1973 Constitution provided as follows:


SEC. 7.  The right to form associations or societies for purposes not
contrary to law shall not be abridged.


This Section was adopted in Section 7 of Proposed Resolution No. 486 of
the 1986 Constitutional Commission, entitled Resolution to Incorporate in the
New Constitution an Article on the Bill of Rights,
[1]
  submitted by the Committee on Citizenship, Bill of Rights, Political Rights
and Obligations, and Human Rights, with a modification, however, consisting of
the insertion of the word union between the words "associations" and
"societies."  Thus the
proposed Section 7 provided as follows:


SEC. 7.  The right of the people to form associations, unions, or
societies for purposes not contrary to law shall not be abridged (italics
supplied).


Commissioner Joaquin G. Bernas, in his sponsorship speech on the
proposed Article on the Bill of Rights, expounded on the nature of the proposed
provision, in this wise:


Section 7 preserves the old
provision not because it is strictly needed but because its removal might be
subject to misinterpretation.  It reads:


    
x x x


It strictly does not prepare the
old provision because it adds the word UNION, and in the explanation we
received from Commissioner Lerum, the term envisions not just unions in private
corporations but also in the government.  This preserves our link with the Malolos Constitution as far as the
right to form associations or societies for purposes not contrary to law is
concerned.
[2]


During the
period of individual amendments, Commissioner Lerum introduced an amendment to
the proposed section consisting of the insertion of the clause "WHETHER
EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OR PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS, which, after consulting other
Commissioners, he modified his proposed amendment to read: "INCLUDING
THOSE EMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS."  At that time, the section read: 


SEC. 7.  The right of the people including those employed in the public
and private sectors to form associations, unions or societies for purposes not
contrary to law shall not be abridged.


Pertinently to
this dispute Commissioner Lerum's intention that the amendment
"automatically abolish" Articles 245 and 246 of the Labor Code.  The Committee accepted the amendment, and
there having been no objection from the floor, the Lerum amendment was
approved, thus:


MR. LERUM:
     
â¦  In proposing that
amendment I ask to make of record that I want the following provisions of the
Labor Code to be automatically abolished, which read:


ART. 245.  Security guards and other personnel employed for the protection
and security of the person, properties and premises of the employers shall not
be eligible for membership in a labor organization.


ART. 246.  Managerial employees are not eligible to join, assist, and form
any labor organization.


THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
Bengzon):


What does the Committee say?


FR. BERNAS:  The Committee accepts.


THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
Bengzon):


The Committee has accepted the
amendment, as amended.  


Is there any objection? 
(Silence)
  The Chair hears none; the amendment, as
amended, is approved.
[3]


The Committee on
Style then recommended that commas be placed after the words people and
sectors, while Commissioner Lerum likewise moved to place the word unions
before the word associations.
[4]
  Section 7, which was subsequently renumbered as Section 8 as presently
appearing in the text ratified in the plebiscite of 2 February 1987, then read
as follows:


The right of the people, including
those employed in the public and private sectors, to form unions, associations,
or societies for purposes not contrary to law shall not be abridged.


It is then
indubitably clear from the foregoing that the intent of the Constitutional
Commission was to abrogate the law prohibiting managerial employees from
joining, assisting, or forming unions or labor organizations.  In this regard, there is absolutely no need
to decipher the intent of the framers of the 1987 Constitution vis-a-vis
Article 245 (originally 246) of the Labor Code, there being no ambiguity or
vagueness in the wording of the present Section 8, Article III of the 1987
Constitution.  The provision is clear
and written in simple language; neither were there any confusing debates thereon.  More importantly, the purpose of
Commissioner Lerum's amendments was unequivocal: he did not merely intend an
implied repeal, but an express repeal of the offending article of the Labor
Code.  The approval of the amendments
left no doubt whatsoever, as faithfully disclosed in the Records of the
Constitutional Commission, that all employees - meaning rank-and-file,
supervisory and managerial - whether from the public or the private sectors,
have the right to form unions for purposes not contrary to law.


The Labor Code
referred to by Commissioner Lerum was P.D. No. 442, promulgated on 1 May
1974.  With the repeal of Article 239 by
Executive Order No. 111 issued on 24 December 1986,
[5]
  Article 246 (as mentioned by Commissioner Lerum) became Article
245.  Thereafter, R.A. No. 6715
[6]
 amended the new Article 245
(originally Article 246) to read, as follows:


SEC. 245.  
Ineligibility of managerial employees to join any labor
organization; right of supervisory employees.
  --  Managerial employees
are not eligible to join, assist or form any labor organization.  Supervisory employees shall not be eligible
for membership in a labor organization of the rank-and-file employees but may
join, assist or form separate labor organizations of their own.
[7]


With the
abrogation of the former Article 246 of the Labor Code,
[8]
 and the constitutional prohibition
against any law prohibiting managerial employees from joining, assisting or
forming unions or labor organizations, the first sentence then of the present
Article 245 of the Labor Code must be struck down as unconstitutional.
[9]
  However, due to an obvious conflict of interest - being closely
identified with the interests of management in view of the inherent nature of
their functions, duties and responsibilities -- managerial employees may only
be eligible to join, assist or form unions or labor organizations of their own
rank, and not those of the supervisory employees nor the rank-and-file
employees. 


In the instant
case, the petitioner's name -- United Pepsi-Cola Supervisory Union (UPSU) --
indubitably attests that it is a union of supervisory employees.  In light of the earlier discussion, the
route managers who are managerial employees, cannot join or assist UPSU.  Accordingly, the Med-Arbiter and public
respondent Laguesma committed no error in denying the petition for direct
certification or for certification election.


I thus vote to
GRANT, IN PART, the instant petition.  That portion of the challenged resolution of public respondent holding
that since the route managers of private respondent Pepsi-Cola Products
Philippines, Inc., are managerial employees, they are "not eligible to
assist, join or form a union or any other organization" should be SET
ASIDE for being violative of Section 8 of Article III of the Constitution,
while that portion thereof denying petitioner's appeal from the Med-Arbiter's
decision dismissing the petition for direct certification or for a
certification election should be AFFIRMED.

1998 : J. Puno's Opinion










SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION


PUNO, 
J
.: 


With due
respect, it is my submission that Article 245 of the Labor Code was not
repealed by section 8, Article III of the 1987 Constitution for reasons
discussed below.


A. 
          
Types of Employees.


For purposes of
applying the law on labor relations, the Labor Code in Article 212 (m) defines
three (3) categories of employees.  They
are managerial, supervisory and rank-and-file, thus:


"Art. 212 (m). "
Managerial
Employee
"  is one who is vested
with powers or prerogatives to lay down and execute management policies and/or
to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline
employees. 
"Supervisory employees"
 are those  who, in the interest of the employer,
effectively recommended such managerial actions if the exercise of such
authority is not merely routinary or clerical in nature but requires the use of
independent judgment.  All employees not
falling within any of the above definitions are considered 
rank-and-file

employees for purposes of this Book."


The test of "managerial" or "supervisory" status
depends on whether a person possesses authority to act in the interest of his
employer and whether such authority is not routinary or clerical in nature but
requires the use of independent judgment.
[1]
 The rank-and-file employee performs
work that is routinary and clerical in nature. The distinction between these
employees is significant because supervisory and rank-and-file employees may
form, join or assist labor organizations.  Managerial employees cannot.


B.  
         
The Exclusion of
Managerial Employees:  


Its Historical Roots in the United States.


The National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA), also known as the Wagner Act, enacted by the U.S.
Congress in 1935, was the first law that regulated labor relations in the
United States and embodied its national labor policy.
[2]
  The purpose of the NLRA was to eliminate obstructions to the free flow
of commerce through the practice of collective bargaining. The NLRA also sought
to protect the workers' full freedoms of association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of
negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid
and protection.
[3]
 The NLRA established the right of
employees to organize, required employers to bargain with employees
collectively through employee-elected representatives, gave employees the right
to engage  in concerted activities for
collective bargaining purposes or other mutual aid or protection, and created the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) as the regulatory agency in
labor-management matters.
[4]


The NLRA was
amended in 1947 by the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), also known as the
Taft-Hartley Act.  This Act sought to
lessen industrial disputes and placed employers in a more nearly equal position
with unions in bargaining and labor relations procedures.
[5]


The NLRA did not
make any special provision for "managerial employees."
[6]
 The privileges and benefits of the
Act were conferred on "employees." Labor organizations thus clamored
for the inclusion of supervisory personnel in the coverage of the Act on the
ground that supervisors were also employees.  Although traditionally, supervisors were regarded as part of management,
the NLRB was constrained to recognize supervisors as employees under the
coverage of the law.  Supervisors were
then granted collective bargaining rights.
[7]
 Nonetheless, the NLRB refused to
consider managers as covered by the law.
[8]


The LMRA took
away the collective bargaining rights of supervisors.  The sponsors of the amendment feared that their unionization
would break down industrial discipline as it would blur the traditional
distinction between management and labor.  They felt it necessary to deny supervisory personnel the right of
collective bargaining to preserve their loyalty to the interests of their
employers.
[9]


Several
amendments were later made on the NLRA but the exclusion of managers and
supervisors from its coverage was preserved.  Until now managers and supervisors are excluded from the law.
[10]
 Their exclusion hinges on the
theory that the employer is entitled to the full loyalty of those whom it
chooses for positions of responsibility, entailing action on the employers'
behalf.  A supervisor's and manager's
ability to control the work of others would be compromised by his sharing of
employee status with them.
[11]


C.  Historical Development in the Philippines.


Labor-management
relations in the Philippines were first regulated under the Industrial Peace
Act
[12]
 which took effect in 1953.  Hailed as the 
Magna Carta
 of Labor,
it was modelled after the NLRA and LMRA of the United States.
[13]
 Most of the basic principles of the
NLRA have been carried over to the Industrial Peace Act and the Labor Code.
[14]
 This is significant because we have
ruled that where our labor statutes are based on statutes in foreign
jurisdiction, the decisions of the high courts in those jurisdictions
construing and interpreting the Act are given persuasive effects in the
application of Philippine law.
[15]


The Industrial Peace
Act did not carry any provision prohibiting managerial employees from joining
labor organizations.  Section 3 of said
law merely provided:


"Sec. 3. 
Employees' Right
to Self-Organization.
-- Employees shall have the right to self-organization
and to form, join or assist labor organizations of their own choosing for the
purpose of collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing
and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining
and other mutual aid and protection.  Individuals employed as supervisors shall not be eligible for membership
in a labor organization of employees under their supervision but may form
separate organizations of their own."


Significantly, the Industrial Peace Act did not define a manager or
managerial employee.  It defined a  "supervisor" but not a
"manager."  Thus:


"Sec. 2. x x x 


(k) "Supervisor" means
any person having authority in the interest of an employer, to hire, transfer,
suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign, recommend, or discipline other
employees, or responsibly to direct them, and to adjust their grievances, or
effectively to recommend such acts, if, in connection with the foregoing, the
exercise of such authority is not of a merely routinary or clerical nature but
requires the use of independent judgment."


In 1972, we
interpreted Section 3 of the Industrial Peace Act to give supervisors the right
to join and form labor organizations of their own.
[16]
 Soon we grappled with the right of
managers to  organize.  In a case involving Caltex managers, we
recognized their right to organize, viz: 


"It would be going too far to
dismiss summarily the point raised by respondent company, that of the alleged
identity of interest between the managerial staff and the employing firm.  That should ordinarily be the case,
especially so where the dispute is between management and the
rank-and-file.  It does not necessarily
follow though that what binds the managerial staff to the corporation forecloses
the possibility of conflict between them.  There could be a real difference between what the welfare of such group
requires and the concessions the firm is willing to grant.  Their needs might not be attended to then in
the absence of any organization of their own.  Nor is this to indulge in empty theorizing.  The records of respondent company, even the very case cited by
it, is proof enough of their uneasy and troubled relationship.  Certainly the impression is difficult to
erase that an alien firm failed to manifest sympathy for the claims of its
Filipino executives."
[17]


The Industrial
Peace Act was repealed in 1975 by P.D. 442, the Labor Code of the
Philippines.  The Labor Code
changed  existing jurisprudence when it
prohibited supervisory and managerial employees from joining labor organizations.  Supervisory unions were no longer recognized
nor allowed to exist and operate as such.
[18]
 We affirmed this statutory
change  in Bulletin Publishing Corp. v.
Sanchez.
[19]
  Similarly, Article 246 of the Labor Code  expressly prohibited managerial employees from forming, assisting
and joining labor organizations, to wit:


"Art. 246.  Ineligibility of managerial employees to
join any labor organization
.--  Managerial employees are not eligible to
join, assist or form any labor organization."  


In the same
Bulletin case, the Court applied Article 246 and held that managerial employees
are the very type of employees who, by the nature of their positions and
functions, have been decreed disqualified from bargaining with management.  This prohibition is based on the rationale
that if  managerial employees were to
belong or be affiliated with a union, the union might not be assured of their
loyalty in view of evident conflict of interest or that the union can be
company-dominated with the presence of managerial employees in the union
membership.
[20]
 In the collective bargaining
process, managerial employees are supposed to be on the side of the employer,
to act as its representative, and to see to it that its interests are well
protected.  The employer is not assured
of such protection if these employees themselves become union members.
[21]


The prohibition
on managerial employees to join, assist or form labor organizations was
retained in the Labor Code despite substantial amendments made in 1989 by R.A.
6715,  the Herrera-Veloso Law.  R.A. 6715 was passed after the effectivity
of the 1987 Constitution and this law did not abrogate, much less amend the
prohibition on managerial employees to join labor organizations.  The express prohibition in Article 246
remained. However, as an addendum to this same Article, R.A. 6715 restored to
supervisory employees the right to join labor organizations of their own.
[22]
 Article 246 now reads:


"Article 246. Ineligibility
of managerial employees to join any labor organization; right of supervisory
employees
.--  Managerial employees are not eligible to
join, assist or form any labor organization.  Supervisory employees shall not be eligible for membership in a labor
organization of the rank-and-file employees but may join, assist or form
separate labor organizations of their own."  


Article 246 became Article 245 after then Article 244 was repealed by
E.O. 111.  Article 246 is presently
Article 245 of the Labor Code.  


Indeed,  Article 245 of the Labor Code prohibiting
managerial employees from joining labor organizations has a social and
historical significance in our labor relations law.  This significance should be considered in deciphering the intent
of the framers of the 1987 Constitution vis-a-vis the said Article.


With due
respect, I do not subscribe to the view that section 8, Article III of the
Constitution abrogated Article 245 of the Labor Code.  A textual analysis of section 8, Article III of the Constitution
will not justify  this conclusion.  With due respect, the resort by Mr. Justice
Davide to the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission does not suffice.  It is generally recognized that debates and
other proceedings in a constitutional convention are of limited value and are
an unsafe guide to the intent of the people.
[23]
  Judge Cooley has stated that:


"When the inquiry is directed
to ascertaining the mischief designed to be remedied, or the purpose sought to
be accomplished by a particular provision, it may be proper to examine the
proceedings of the convention which framed the instrument.  Where the proceedings clearly point out the
purpose of the provision, the aid will be valuable and satisfactory;  but where the question is one of abstract
meaning, it will be difficult to derive from this source much reliable
assistance in interpretation.  Every
member of such a convention acts upon such motives and reasons as influence him
personally, and the motions and debates do not necessarily indicate the purpose
of a majority of a convention in adopting a particular clause.  It is quite possible for a particular clause
to appear so clear and unambiguous to the members of the convention as to
require neither discussion nor illustration;  and the few remarks made concerning it in the convention might have a
plain tendency to lead directly away from the meaning in the minds of the
majority.  It is equally possible for a
part of the members to accept a clause in one sense and a part in another.  And even if we were certain we had attained
to the meaning of the convention, it is by no means to be allowed a controlling
force, especially if that meaning appears not to be the one which the words
would most naturally and obviously convey.  For as the constitution does not derive its force from the convention
which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at
is that of the people, and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for
any dark and abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have
accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, and
ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be
conveyed."
[24]


It is for this
reason that proceedings of constitutional conventions are less conclusive of
the proper construction of the instrument than are legislative proceedings of
the proper construction of the statute.
[25]
 In statutes, it is the intent of
the legislature that is being sought, while in constitutions, it is the intent
of the people that is being ascertained through the discussions and
deliberations of their representatives.
[26]
 The proper interpretation of
constitutional provisions depends  more
on how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framers'
understanding thereof.
[27]


Thus, debates
and proceedings of the constitutional convention are never of binding
force.  They may be valuable but are not
necessarily decisive.
[28]
 They may shed a useful light upon
the purpose sought to be accomplished or upon the meaning attached to the words
employed.  And the courts are free  to avail themselves of any light that may be
derived from such sources, but they are not bound to adopt it as the sole
ground of their decision.
[29]


Clearly then, a
statute cannot be declared void on the sole ground that it is repugnant to a
supposed intent or spirit declared in constitutional convention
proceedings.  


D.  Freedom of Association


The right of
association flows from freedom of expression.
[30]
  Like the right of expression, the exercise of the right of association
is not absolute.  It is subject to
certain limitations.


Article 243 of
the Labor Code reiterates the right of association of people in the labor
sector.  Article 243 provides:


"Art. 243. Coverage of
employees' right to self-organization
.--
  All persons employed in commercial,
industrial and agricultural enterprises and in religious, charitable, medical,
or educational institutions whether operating for profit or not, shall have the
right to self-organization and to form, join, or assist labor organizations of
their own choosing for purposes of collective bargaining.  Ambulant, intermittent and itinerant
workers, self-employed people, rural workers and those without any definite
employers may form labor organizations for their mutual aid and protection."


Article 243 guarantees the right to self-organization and association to
"all persons."  This seemingly
all-inclusive coverage of "all persons," however, actually admits of
exceptions.  


Article 244
[31]
 of the Labor Code mandates that all
employees in the civil service, i.e, those not employed in government
corporations established under the Corporation Code, may only form associations
but may not collectively bargain on terms and conditions fixed by law.  An employee of a cooperative who is a member
and co-owner thereof cannot invoke the right of collective bargaining and
negotiation vis-a-vis the cooperative.
[32]
 An owner cannot bargain with
himself or his co-owners.
[33]
 Employees in foreign embassies or
consulates or in foreign international organizations granted international
immunities are also excluded from the right to form labor organizations.
[34]
 International organizations are
organized mainly as a means for conducting general international business in
which the member-states have an interest and the immunities granted them shield
their affairs from political pressure or control by the host country and assure
the unimpeded performance of their functions.
[35]


Confidential
employees have also been denied the right to form labor-organizations.
Confidential employees do not constitute a distinct category for purposes of
organizational right.  Confidentiality
may attach to a managerial or non-managerial position.  We have, however, excluded confidential
employees from joining labor organizations following the rationale behind the
disqualification of managerial employees in Article 245.  In the case of National Association of Trade
Unions-Republic Planters' Bank Supervisors Chapter v. Torres,
[36]
36 we held:


"In the collective bargaining
process, managerial employees are supposed to be on the side of the employer,
to act as its representatives, and to see to it that its interests are well
protected.  The employer is not assured
of such protection if these employees themselves are union members.  Collective bargaining in such a situation
can become one-sided.  It is the same
reason that impelled this Court to consider the position of confidential
employees as included in the disqualification found in Article 245 as if the
disqualification of confidential employees were written in the provision.  If confidential employees could unionize in
order to bargain for advantages for themselves, then they could be governed by
their own motives rather than the interest of the employers.  Moreover, unionization of confidential employees
for the purpose of collective bargaining would mean the extension of the law to
persons or individuals who are supposed  to act "in the interest of" the employers.  It is not farfetched that in the course of
collective bargaining, they might jeopardize that interest which they are
duty-bound to protect."
[37]
37


E.  The disqualification extends only to labor organizations.


It must be noted
that Article 245 of the Labor Code deprives managerial employees of their right
to join "labor organizations."  A labor organization is defined under the Labor Code as:


"Article 212 (g). "Labor
organization" means any union or association of employees which exists in
whole or in part for the purpose of collective bargaining or of dealing with
the employer concerning terms and conditions of employment."


A labor
organization has two broad rights:  (1)
to bargain collectively  and (2) to deal
with the employer concerning terms and conditions of employment.  To bargain collectively is a right given to
a labor organization once it registers itself with the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE).  Dealing with the
employer, on the other hand, is a generic description of interaction between
employer and employees concerning grievances, wages, work hours and other terms
and conditions of employment, even if the employees' group is not registered
with the DOLE.
[38]
  Any  labor organization which may
or may not be a union may deal with the employer.  This explains why a workers' organization does not always have to
be a labor union and why employer-employee collective interactions are not
always collective bargaining.
[39]


In the instant
case, it may be argued that managerial employees' labor organization will
merely "deal with the employer concerning terms and conditions of
employment" especially when top management is composed of aliens,
following the  circumstances in the
Caltex case.  


Although the
labor organization may exist wholly for the purpose of dealing with the
employer concerning terms and conditions of employment, there is no prohibition
in the Labor Code for it to become a legitimate labor organization and engage
in collective bargaining.  Once a labor
organization registers with the DOLE and becomes legitimate, it is entitled to
the rights accorded under Articles 242 and 263 (b) of the Labor Code.  And these include the right to strike and
picket.  


Notably,
however, Article 245 does not absolutely disqualify managerial employees from
exercising their right of association.  What it prohibits is merely the right to join labor organizations.
Managerial employees may form associations or organizations so long as they are
not labor organizations.  The freedom of
association guaranteed under the Constitution remains and has not been totally
abrogated by Article 245.


To declare Article
245 of the Labor Code unconstitutional cuts deep into our existing industrial
life and will open the floodgates to unionization at all levels of the
industrial hierarchy.  Such a ruling
will wreak havoc on the existing set-up between management and labor. If all
managerial employees will be allowed to unionize, then all who are in the
payroll of the company, starting from the president, vice-president, general
managers and everyone, with the exception of the directors, may go on strike or
picket the employer.
[40]
 Company officers will join forces
with the supervisors and rank-and-file.  Management and labor will become a solid phalanx with bargaining rights
that could be enforced against the owner of the company.
[41]
 The basic opposing forces in the
industry will not be management and labor but the operating group on the one
hand and the stockholder and bondholder group on the other.  The industrial problem defined in the Labor
Code comes down to a contest over a fair division of the gross receipts of
industry between these two groups.
[42]
 And this will certainly bring
ill-effects on our economy.


The framers of
the Constitution could not have intended a major upheaval of our labor and
socio-economic systems.  Their
intent  cannot be made to override
substantial policy considerations and create absurd or impossible situations.
[43]
 A constitution must be viewed as a
continuously operative charter of government.  It must not be interpreted as demanding the impossible or the
impracticable; or as effecting the unreasonable or absurd.
[44]
 Courts should always endeavour to
give such interpretation that would make the constitutional provision and the
statute  consistent with reason, justice
and the public interest.

dismiss the petition.

United Pepsi-Cola Supervisory Union vs Laguesma : 122226 :  March 25,
1998 : J. Vitug's Opinion










SEPARATE (CONCURRING & DISSENTING) OPINION


VITUG, J.:


The pivotal
issues raised in the case at bar, aptly stated by the Office of the Solicitor
General, are:


(1)  Whether or not public respondent,
Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment ("DOLE")
Bienvenido E. Laguesma, gravely abused his discretion in categorizing the
members of petitioner union to be managerial employees and thus ineligible to
form or join labor organizations; and


(2) Whether or
not the provision of Article 245 of the Labor Code, disqualifying managerial
employees from joining, assisting or forming any labor organization, violates
Section 8, Article III, of the 1987 Constitution, which expresses that
"(t)he right of the people, including those employed in public and private
sectors to form unions, associations or societies for purposes not contrary to
law shall not be abridged."


The case
originated from a petition for direct certification or certification election
among route managers/supervisory employees of Pepsi-Cola Products Phils., Inc.
("Pepsi"), filed by the United Pepsi-Cola Supervisory Union
("Union"), claiming to be a legitimate labor organization duly
registered with the Department of Labor and Employment under Registration
Certificate No. NCR-UR-3-1421-95.  Pepsi
opposed the petition on the thesis that the case was no more than a mere
duplication of a previous petition for direct certification
1
  filed by the same route managers through the Pepsi-Cola Employees
Association (PCEA-Supervisory) which petition had already been denied by
Undersecretary Laguesma.  The holding
reiterated a prior decision in Workers Alliance Trade Unions ("WATU")
vs. Pepsi-Cola Products Phils., Inc.,
2
  that route
managers were managerial employees.  


In its decision,
dated 05 May 1995, Med-Arbiter Brigida C. Fadrigon dismissed for lack of merit
the petition of the Union, stating that the issue on the proper classification
and status of route managers had already been ruled with finality in the
previous decisions, aforementioned, rendered by DOLE.


The union
appealed the decision.  In his
resolution of 31 August 1995, Undersecretary Laguesma dismissed the appeal,
saying that there was no compelling reason to abandon the ruling in the two old
cases theretofore decided by DOLE.  In
his order of 22 September 1995, Undersecretary Laguesma denied the Union's
motion for reconsideration.


The Union went
to this Court, via a petition for certiorari, assailing the cancellation of its
certificate of registration.  The Court,
after considering the petition and the comments thereon filed by both public
and private respondents, as well as the consolidated reply of petitioner,
dismissed the case in its resolution of 08 July 1996 on the premise that no
grave abuse of discretion had been committed by public respondent.


Undaunted, the
Union moved, with leave, for the reconsideration of the dismissal of its
petition by the Court En Banc.  In its
resolution of 16 June 1997, the case was referred to the Court En Banc en
consulta with the movant's invocation of unconstitutionality of Article 245 of
the Labor Code vis-a-vis Section 8, Article III, of the 1987 Constitution.


There is merit,
in my view, in petitioner's motion for reconsideration but not on
constitutional grounds.


There are, in
the hierarchy of management, those who fall below the level of key officers of
an enterprise whose terms and conditions of employment can well be, indeed are
not infrequently, provided for in collective bargaining agreements.  To this group belong the supervisory
employees.  The "managerial
employees," upon the other hand, and relating the matter particularly to
the Labor Code, are those "vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down
and execute management policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off,
recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees" as distinguished from
the supervisory employees whose duties in these areas are so designed as to
verily be implementary to the policies or rules and regulations already
outstanding and priorly taken up and passed upon by management.  The managerial level is the source, as well
as prescribes the compliance, of broad mandates which, in the field of labor
relations, are to be carried out through the next rank of employees charged
with actually seeing to the specific personnel action required.  In fine, the real authority, such as in
hiring or firing of employees, comes from management and exercised by means of
instructions, given in general terms, by the "managerial employees;"
the supervisory employees, although ostensibly holding that power, in truth,
however, only act in obedience to the directives handed down to them.  The latter unit, unlike the former, cannot
be considered the alter ego of the owner of enterprise.

I submit, with
due respect, that the members of petitioning union, not really being
"managerial employees" in the true sense of the term, are not
disqualified from forming or joining labor organizations under Article 245 of

briefly touch base on the constitutional question raised by the parties on
Article 245 of the Labor Code.


The Constitution

purposes not contrary to law x x x."

Code which states: "Managerial employees are not eligible to join, assist
or form any labor organization," being in direct collision with the
Constitutional provision, must now be declared abrogated in the law.


Frankly, I do
not see such a "direct collision."  The Constitution did not obviously grant a limitless right "to form
unions, associations or societies" for it has clearly seen it fit to
subject its exercise to possible legislative judgment such as may be
appropriate or, to put it in the language of the Constitution itself, to
"purposes not contrary to law."


Freedom of
association, like freedom of expression, truly occupies a choice position in
the hierarchy of constitutional values.  Even while the Constitution itself recognizes the State's prerogative to
qualify this right, heretofore discussed, any limitation, nevertheless, must
still be predicated on the existence of a substantive evil sought to be
addressed.
6
  Indeed, in the exercise of police power,
the State may, by law, prescribe proscriptions, provided reasonable and legitimate
of course, against even the most basic rights of individuals.


The restriction
embodied in Article 245 of the Labor Code is not without proper rationale.  Concededly, the prohibition to form labor
organizations on the part of managerial employees narrows down their freedom of
association.  The very nature of
managerial functions, however, should preclude those who exercise them from
taking a position adverse to the interest they are bound to serve and protect.  The mere opportunity to undermine that
interest can validly be restrained.  To
say that the right of managerial employees to form a "labor
organization" within the context and ambit of the Labor Code should be
deemed totally separable from the right to bargain collectively is not
justified by related provisions of the Code.  For instance -


"ART.
212.  Definitions.
7
  - x x x


"(g)
         
`Labor organization' means any union or
association of employees which exists in whole or in part for the purpose of collective
bargaining or of dealing with employers concerning terms and conditions of
employment.


    
"x x x
   
x
x x
    
x x x.


"(m)
        
`Managerial employee' is one who is
vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and execute management policies
and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or
discipline employees.  Supervisory
employees are those who, in the interest of the employer, effectively recommend
such managerial actions if the exercise of such authority is not merely
routinely or clerical in nature but requires the use of independent
judgment.  All employees not falling
within any of the above definitions are considered rank-and-file employees for
purposes of this Book."


"ART.
263.  x x x


"(b)
         
Workers shall have the right to engage
in concerted activities for purposes of collective bargaining or for their
mutual benefit and protection.  The
right of legitimate labor organizations to strike and picket and of employers
to lockout, consistent with the national interest, shall continue to be
recognized and respected."


The maxim
"ut res magis quam pereat" requires not merely that a statute should
be given such a consequence as to be deemed whole but that each of its express
provisions equally should be given the intended effect.


I find it hard
to believe that the fundamental law could have envisioned the use by managerial
employees of coercive means against their own employers over matters entrusted
by the latter to the former.  Whenever
trust and confidence is a major aspect of any relationship, a conflict of
interest on the part of the person to whom that trust and confidence is reposed
must be avoided and when, unfortunately, it does still arise its containment
can rightly be decreed.


Article 245 of
the Labor Code indeed aligns itself to the Corporation Code, the basic law on
by far the most commonly used business vehicle - the corporation - which
prescribes the tenure of office, as well as the duties and functions, including
terms of employment (governed in most part by the Articles of Incorporation,
the By-laws of the Corporation, or resolutions of the Board of Directors), of
corporate officers for both the statutory officers, i.e., the president, the
treasurer and the corporate secretary, and the non-statutory officers, i.e.,
those who occupy positions created by the corporate by-laws who are deemed
essential for effective management of the enterprise.  I cannot imagine these officers as being legally and morally
capable of associating themselves into a labor organization and asserting collective
bargaining rights against the very entity in whose behalf they act and are
supposed to act.  


I submit,
accordingly, that, firstly, the members of petitioner union or the so-called
route managers, being no more than supervisory employees, can lawfully organize
themselves into a labor union within the meaning of the Labor Code, and that,
secondly, the questioned provision of Article 245 of the Labor Code has not
been revoked by the 1987 Constitution. 


WHEREFORE, I
vote, given all the foregoing, for the reversal of the resolution of 31 August
1995, and the order of 22 September 1995, of public respondent.
