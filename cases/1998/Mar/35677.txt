FELIXBERTO BIANTAN, PETITIONER,
VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSIONÂ 
(FOURTH DIVISION, CEBU CITY)Â Â 
ANDÂ Â  VICTORIAS MILLING CO.,
INC.,Â  RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO,Â Â  J.:


FELIXBERTO BIANTAN,
petitioner, was hired in June 1957 by Victorias Milling Co., Inc. (VICTORIAS)
as  "wire straightener."  In 1987, or after thirty (30) years, rising
from the ranks in the company, he assumed the position of Head of its Salvage
and Disposal Section, Inventory Control and Warehousing Department.  


On 15 March 1989
respondent VICTORIAS' Internal Audit-Field Operations through its
representatives aborted the anomalous sale of four (4) brand new Exide
batteries passed off as "discarded" to a certain Victor Go.  After conducting further investigations, the
representatives unearthed that sometime prior thereto, particularly on 18
January 1989, four (4) other brand new Exide batteries but classified as
"deteriorated" were also sold to Go.


On 7 April 1989
notices to explain the apparent anomaly were sent to petitioner and other
employees who could have had a hand in the deviant transactions.  On 10 April 1989 petitioner submitted his
written explanation denying involvement therein whatsoever.  On 12 April 1989 the Personnel Officer
himself conducted an in-plant investigation. 


On 24 April
1989, effective on the same day, petitioner was placed under preventive
suspension for a month.  On 8 May 1989
he sought reconsideration with a request for a formal investigation to enable
him to confront the witnesses and dispute the evidence against him.  On 22 May 1989 the request was denied.  The following day, his suspension was
extended for fifteen (15) days.  


On the bases of
the statements of witnesses, company records and petitioner's explanation
letter, petitioner was declared principally involved in the anomalous transfer
and sale of safe-kept and brand-new Exide batteries thus -


1.  Falsely identified four (4) brand-new storage batteries, Exide,
contained in Shipping List #213424 dated January 17, 1989, as
"Deteriorated Batteries" per Shipping List #0789 dated January 18,
1989 prepared by you and on the basis of which the sale of the said brand-new
batteries - Exide - to Mr. Victor Go materialized under the classification and
pricing as deteriorated batteries.


2.  Personally withdrawing from the main Warehouse four (4) brand-new
storage batteries per Shipping List #213432 dated March 15, 1989, which
batteries are marked, "For Safekeeping assigned to Rolling Stock," and
transferred to Scrap Yard without clearance from the Rolling Stock as
owner/end-user of said brand-new batteries.  Moreover, Shipping List #213432 had not been signed by Mr. Emilio Yee,
Head of Inventory and Warehousing Department, nor the knowledge or authority of
Mr. Rodolfo Victoriano, MCD Manager.


3.  Selling the said four (4) brand-new storage batteries safe-kept by
Rolling Stock to Mr. Victor Go by falsely identifying them as "Discarded
Storage Batteries" per Shipping List #14149 dated March 15, 1989; in
handwritten note dated March 15; and in Inventory Cash Sales Invoice (ICSI)
#10752 also dated March 15, 1989.  Moreover, said ICSI #10752 was not signed by either Mr. Victoriano or
Mr. Yee who  are the authorized persons
but only signed by you.  It was further
gathered during the investigation that the preparation by Scrap Yard of S/L
#14149 and approved by you was irregular having been prepared ahead of ICSI
#10752 at which time there was yet no approval from either Mr. Victoriano or
Mr. Yee.  It was confirmed upon
interception by Audit that said falsely identified discarded batteries are in
reality brand-new storage batteries - Exide.
[1]
 


On 31 May 1989
petitioner's services were terminated while his Department Head, Emilio Yee,
was demoted one rank and suspended for six (6) months.


Petitioner then
contested his dismissal as illegal and prayed for reinstatement and back
wages.  


On 29 May 1992,
justifying the termination of petitioner's services, the Labor Arbiter
dismissed the claims of petitioner
[2]
 after taking into account these
points - 


x x x x With regard to the items
sold in January 1989 it was shown that complainant, in his own handwriting
classified the 4 industrial batteries as deteriorated ones, when he fully knew
that said items were unused and therefore new.  The acts of the complainant in setting the pricing as scrap/deteriorated
items of said 4 batteries as well as in preparing the shipping list covering
the transfer of the batteries sold to the buyer describing same as
deteriorated, clearly show that complainant took a direct hand in committing
this offense of fraud against the company, which is enough and sufficient
reason for the latter to lose its confidence on the complainant.  Moreover, it was shown that complainant was
even the one who marked these batteries for safekeeping as he was then assigned
with the warehousing section in charge of safekept items and that despite the
knowledge that the 4 batteries were brand-new, still marked and classified them
as deteriorated.


The respondent company had also
shown that on March 15, 1989, the complainant had again described 4 brand new
locomotive batteries as "discarded batteries," when he fully knew
that these were brand new and therefore not destined for Scrap yard for sale as
discarded batteries x x x x
[3]
 


Public
respondent National Labor Relations Commission found the conclusion of the
Labor Arbiter amply supported by the evidence.  Thus on 28 February 1995 NLRC dismissed the appeal.
[4]
 


The issue is
very simple:  whether the dismissal of
petitioner from his employment was legal or illegal.


Petitioner
insists that he had no involvement whatsoever in the disputed
transactions.  He argues that in the 18
January 1989 transaction, the disposal, sale and transfer of the four (4) Exide
batteries were not decided nor performed by him but by the Head of his
Department, the Chief of the Warehousing Section and the buyer.  As regards particularly the 15 March 1989
transaction, petitioner proffers the excuse that it was duly authorized by the
Capital Asset Management Group, the Disposal Committee and the Head of his
Department.


Petitioner fails
to convince us.  Private respondent's
evidence adequately delineated and specified his participation in the 18
January 1989 sale of the supposedly deteriorated batteries -


x x x x Mr. Jaime Beboso, a
storekeeper of the Salvage and Disposal Section whose immediate superior is the
complainant, attested to the fact that they received the fifty (50) items on
January 17, 1989 from the Warehousing Section covered by SL No. 213424, that
when he inspected the items, he found out that 46 automotive batteries were
totally damaged and rotten and the other four industrial batteries which were
placed inside the wooden crate made of palochina and individually packed in
cartons were brand new; that complainant was present when Mr. Beboso inspected
and opened the cartons of these four industrial batteries and that when he
remarked that these were brand new, he was instructed by the complainant to
just receive them; that the following day, Mr. Victor Go pulled out these items
(50) and bought them; that though it was Mr. Beboso who was tasked with the
preparation of the shipping list covering the transfer of the items sold to the
buyer, complainant tasked (?) it upon himself to  prepare   SL  No. 0789; that in the said SL, complainant
classified the four (4)  industrial
batteries as deteriorated when he fully knew  well (sic) that said items were brand new and unused x x x x
[5]
 


The same
statement as above holds true with regard to the 15 March 1989 sale of
purportedly discarded batteries -


x x x x that when Mr. Sta. Ana
(Chief of the Warehousing Section) opened the wooden crate, and individual
cartons in the presence of the complainant, he found out that these batteries
were brand new; that despite the fact that these batteries were brand new and
thus, not destined for Scrap Yard, complainant still asked Mr. Sta. Ana whether
he could bring out the 4 batteries to which the latter answered that shipping
list covering the transfer from the warehouse to the scrap yard should first be
prepared; that in view of the representations made by complainant that he was
instructed by Mr. Yee to bring out the batteries, Mr. Sta. Ana had instructed
to prepare shipping list No. 213432 dated March 15, 1989, to which complainant
acknowledged receipt of the items stated in the list; that the shipping list
described the batteries as "discarded batteries"; that complainant
then loaded the 4 batteries to the Scrap Yard service vehicle, which were still
contained in the wooden crate marked for "safekeeping", assigned to
Rolling Stock; that these batteries were bought by the buyer, Mr. Go, to which
complainant instructed Mr. Beboso to prepare the handwritten note which was
duly approved by complainant for the purchase amount for discarded batteries x
x x x that upon instruction of complainant, Mr. Beboso also prepared ICSI No.
10752 duly approved by the former x x x x
[6]
 


Culled from the
mass of evidence of respondent company it is clear that petitioner indeed had a
direct hand in perpetrating the fraud against the company.  Taking into consideration the nature of the
work of petitioner which consisted in planning, directing and controlling the
over-all operation of the Salvage and Disposal Section,
[7]
 private respondent had sufficient
grounds to lose confidence in him.  In
this connection, the findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter as well as those of
respondent NLRC, being supported by substantial evidence, are binding upon this
Court.
[8]
 


However, we
agree with the observation of the Office of the Solicitor General that
petitioner was not accorded due process hence he  must be indemnified by private respondent in the amount of 
P
1,000.00
conformably with established jurisprudence.
[9]
 In this regard, and there being no
issue raised on the amount of indemnity, an award of 
P
1,000.00 as
recommended by the OSG may be granted to petitioner for denying him due
process.  The request of petitioner for
formal investigation in order to confront the witnesses and controvert the
evidence against him underscores the inadequacy of the in-plant
investigation.  It is a well-known rule
that before an employer may dismiss an employee, the latter must be afforded
due process which means, among others, the opportunity to confront the
witnesses against him and to adduce evidence in his defense.
[10]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DISMISSED.  The decision of respondent National Labor
Relations Commission dated 28 February 1995 affirming the dismissal by the
Labor Arbiter of petitioner's complaint for illegal dismissal is  AFFIRMED, subject to the modification that,
as recommended by the Office of the Solicitor General, private respondent
Victorias Milling Co., Inc., is ordered to pay petitioner Felixberto Biantan 
P
1,000.00
as indemnity for non-observance of due process in his dismissal from the
service.


SO  ORDERED.
