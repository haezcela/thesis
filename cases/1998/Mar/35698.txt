SOMERVILLE STAINLESS STEEL
CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND
JERRY MACANDOG, REYNALDO MIRANDA, ROBERTO TAGALA, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Not every
loss incurred or expected to be incurred by an employer can justify
retrenchment.  The employer 
must
prove,
 among others, that the losses are substantial and that the
retrenchment is reasonably necessary to avert such losses.


Statement of the Case


This principle
is applied by this Court in resolving this petition for 
certiorari
 under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolutions of the National Labor
Relations Commission
[1]
 
(NLRC) promulgated on May 9, 1996,
[2]
 and on July 18, 1996
[3]
 in NLRC NCR CA No.
008064-94.
[4]
 Public respondentâs
assailed Decision affirmed Labor Arbiter Cornelio L. Linsanganâs decision
[5]
 dated November 14, 1994,
but deleted the award in favor of Amando Baldevia, Rolando Eusebia, Ma. Rosita
Paradero-Arevara and Marilou Libres, who withdrew their complaints and waived
all claims against the petitioner, Somerville Stainless Steel Corporation
(SSSC).
[6]
 The labor arbiter, in his
decision, disposed as follows:


âThe separation pay and
proportionate 13th-month due the complainants as per computation of the
Research and Information Office, this Arbitration Branch, which computation is
hereby approved and adopted as Annex âAâ of this Decision, are as follows:

WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby
rendered ordering the respondent company and its owners to pay each complainant
the sum of Thirty Thousand Pesos (
P
30,000.00) as backwages and
damages.  In addition, the respondent
company and its owners are also ordered to pay complainants separation pay and
13th month pay as indicated above.


SO ORDERED.â
[7]


The
public respondent, in its assailed July 17, 1996 Resolution, denied
petitionerâs motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.


The Facts


The
facts, as borne by the records, are narrated by the labor arbiter as follows:


âSomerville Stainless Steel
Corporation, the company for brevity, is engaged in the business of
manufacturing stainless steel kitchen equipments [sic].  On different dates, the complainants were employed
by the respondent company.


The present controversy was
triggered by the inability of the respondent company to pay its workers certain
benefits stipulated in their collective bargaining agreement starting 16 March
1993.  The CBA benefits that were withheld
by management are rice subsidy, incentive leave pay, hospitalization, t-shirts
and safety shoes and incentive bonus.


Complainants allege that on 09
April 1993 their union, represented by their president and vice-president,
communicated with respondents for a renegotiation of their CBA but the same was
rejected by the latter.  They aver that
on 19 April 1993 their union filed a notice of strike with the Department of
Labor and Employment for unfair labor practice.  Complainants claim that on the pay day of 31 May 1994 Jerry
Macandog, Antonio de Castro, Jr., Ma. Rosita Paradero, Reynaldo Nevado, Roberto
Tagala, Johnny Miranda, Domingo Sumigaya, Nonalito Nicolas, Mario Clet, Johnny
Mosquera, Renato Yape, among others, were surprised to receive a notice of
retrenchment which was inserted in their pay envelopes.  Complainants contend that most of the
retrenched employees were union officers.  They explain that only the union secretary was not terminated.
Complainants stress that their dismissal was without just cause and in utter
disregard of their right to due process.  They assert that the true intention of management was to bust their
union which was very insistent on the renegotiation and renewal of their CBA
with the respondent company.  Complainants explain further that while the notice of their retrenchment
specifically states that its effectivity is 30 June 1993, the retrenched
employees were no longer allowed to enter the company premises starting 16 June
1993, thus forcing the retrenched employees to stage a picket in front of the
company premises.


Stressing further their charges of
unfair labor practice, complainants state that the respondents, led by Messrs.
Prigg and Dante Reyes, caused the removal of company equipments [sic], files
and other movable properties and transferred them to another site.


Complainants likewise claim that
management never discussed with their union their retrenchment and that there
was no retrenchment program presented to them.  Moreover, they allege that they were never advised of the basis or
criteria as to who were to be retrenched.


Respondents reiterated their
contention in their motion to dismiss in that individual respondents Leigh
Anthony Prigg and Dante Reyes are not parties in interest and therefore the
complaint should be dismissed insofar as they are concerned.


The foregoing
contention is partly correct.  There is
no clear showing that respondent Prigg is the president of respondent
company.  It does not also appear that
he had a hand in the termination or retrenchment of complainants.  With regard to respondent Dante Reyes, it is
admitted that he was designated officer-in-charge of the respondent
company.  Among the powers given him is
the power to administer the affairs of the respondent company.  Contrary to the pretensions of respondents,
the power of respondent Dante Reyes is not limited but very broad.  In any case, the complaint against him can
not likewise be given to do [sic] with the retrenchment of complainants.  It was former general of the company William
Doland, Jr. who retrenched the complainants.â
[8]


Adopting
the labor arbiterâs factual findings, the NLRC adds:


âContravening the
allegations of the complainants, the respondent company avers that it was
experiencing serious business losses due to the effects of the economic and
power crisis which the nation was then experiencing.  The company alleges that Mr. William Donald Somerville met with
the companyâs employees and informed them of the difficulties it was undergoing
and that the withdrawal of employee benefits was to be only temporary until the
company recovers from its financial debacle.  The respondent explains that the union sought to be more adversarial
rather than conciliatory which only added to the further deterioration of the
companyâs financial condition.  This,
the respondent claims, served as the impetus for its undertaking the disputed
retrenchment program.  The respondent
recounts that the union declared a strike and conducted a picket at midnight of
15 June 1993.â
[9]


As
earlier stated, the NLRC substantially affirmed the labor arbiterâs
decision.  Undaunted, petitioner lodged
this petition with this Court.
[10]


The Issues


The
petitioner presents the following issues:


âA.
            
Whether
the retrenchment undertaken is valid.


B.
 
Whether
the retrenchment is attended with good faith.


C.
 
Whether
the finding of facts is contrary to the evidence in record.


D.
 
Whether private respondent Roberto Goce should
be included in the award judgment.â
[11]


In the
main, these issues boil down to this question:  Was petitionerâs retrenchment of private respondents justified?


The Courtâs Ruling


The
petition is not meritorious.


Main
Issue:


Retrenchment Unjustified


Retrenchment
is one of the âauthorizedâ causes for the dismissal of employees.  Resorted to by an employer to avoid or
minimize business losses,
[12]
 it is recognized under
Art. 283 of the Labor Code:


âART. 283.  Closure of establishment and reduction of
personnel. -- The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee
due to the installation of labor saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to
prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or
undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the
provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the worker and the
Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended
date thereof.  In case of termination
due to the installation of labor saving devices or redundancy, the worker
affected thereby shall be entitled to at least his one (1) month pay or to at
least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.  In case of retrenchment to prevent losses
and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or
undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the
separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half
(1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.  A fraction of at least six (6) months shall
be considered as one (1) whole year.â


To
justify retrenchment, the âlossâ referred to in Art. 283 cannot be just any
kind or amount of loss; otherwise, a company could easily feign excuses to suit
its whims and prejudices or to rid itself of unwanted employees.  To guard against this possibility of abuse,
the Court has laid down the following standard which a company must meet to
justify retrenchment:


â x x x Firstly, the losses
expected should be substantial and not merely 
de minimis
 in extent.  If the loss purportedly sought to be
forestalled by retrenchment is clearly shown to be insubstantial and
inconsequential in character, the 
bonafide
 nature of the retrenchment
would appear to be seriously in question.  Secondly, the substantial loss apprehended must be reasonably imminent,
as such imminence can be perceived objectively and in good faith by the
employer.  There should, in other words,
be a certain degree of urgency for the retrenchment, which is after all a
drastic recourse with serious consequences for the livelihood of the employees
retired or otherwise laid off.  Because
of the consequential nature of retrenchment, it must, thirdly, be reasonably
necessary and likely to effectively prevent the expected losses.  The employer should have taken other
measures prior or parallel to retrenchment to forestall losses, i.e., cut other
costs other than labor costs.  An
employer who, for instance, lays off substantial numbers of workers while
continuing to dispense fat executive bonuses and perquisites or so-called
âgolden parachutes,â can scarcely claim to be retrenching in good faith to
avoid losses.  To impart operational
meaning to the constitutional policy of providing âfull protectionâ to labor,
the employerâs prerogative to bring down labor costs by retrenching must be
exercised essentially as a measure of last resort, after less drastic means --
e.g., reduction of both management and rank-and-file- bonuses and salaries,
going on reduced time, improving manufacturing efficiencies, trimming of
marketing and advertising costs, etc. -- have been tried and found wanting.


Lastly, but
certainly not the least important, alleged losses if already realized, and the
expected imminent losses sought to be forestalled, must be proved by sufficient
and convincing evidence.  The reason for
requiring this quantum of proof is readily apparent: any less exacting standard
of proof would render too easy the abuse of this ground for termination of
services of employees. x x xâ
[13]


In a
nutshell, the law recognizes a companyâs right to retrench employees when âmade
necessary or compelled by economic factors that would otherwise endanger its
stability or existence.â
[14]
 Unarguably, retrenchment
is only âa measure of last resort when other less drastic means have been tried
and found to be inadequate.â
[15]


Petitioner SSSC contends that the retrenchment it carried
out, which resulted in the private respondentsâ termination from employment,
measures up to this standard.  Petitioner claims that it âdid not only expect substantial losses but
had already and have [sic] actually suffered the same.â
[16]
 It points out that, as of
December 31, 1992, it has accumulated losses amounting to 
P
392,996.36,
which constitutes 98.25 percent of the stockholderâs equity of 
P
400,000.
[17]
 Hence, petitioner bewails
the public respondentâs finding that, for the fiscal year 1992, its loss of 
P
106,641.67
was ânot substantial to impair its operation,â
[18]
 and that âsaid loss [was]
not substantialâ
[19]
 compared to its income of 
P
7,451,981.35
in the same year.  In the main,
petitioner argues that the NLRC âacted capriciously and whimsically in
disregarding the evidence on record and rendering [the decision] that the
retrenchment [was] invalid.â
[20]
 


The
Court is not persuaded.  Considering the
severe consequences occasioned by retrenchment on the livelihood of the
employee(s) to be dismissed, and the avowed policy of the State -- under Sec.
3, Art. XIII of the Constitution, and Art. 3 of the Labor Code -- to afford
full protection to labor and to assure the employeeâs right to enjoy security
of tenure, the Court reiterates that ânot every loss incurred or expected to be
incurred by a company will justify retrenchment.  The losses must be substantial and the retrenchment must be
reasonably necessary to avert such losses.â
[21]
 Settled is the rule that
the employer bears the burden of proving this allegation of the existence or
imminence of substantial losses, which by its nature is an affirmative
defense.  It is the duty of the employer
to prove with clear and satisfactory evidence that legitimate business reasons
exist to justify retrenchment.
[22]
 Failure to do so
âinevitably results in a finding that the dismissal is unjustified.â
[23]
 And the determination of
whether an employer has sufficiently and successfully discharged this burden of
proof âis essentially a question of fact for the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC to
determine.â
[24]


In the
case at bar, the Court notes that both the labor arbiter and the NLRC, which
possess administrative expertise in the specific matter of labor law, found the
retrenchment effected by the SSSC unnecessary, for petitioner has not incurred
any substantial loss(es) or exhausted all other less drastic economic measures
to avert business losses.
[25]
 These concurring factual
findings and conclusions are entitled not only to respect but even finality on
review before this Court, unless the public respondentâs decision is found
tainted with grave abuse of discretion.
[26]
 Thus, petitioner must
prove that the NLRC âacted capriciously and whimsically in total disregard of
evidence material to or even decisive of the controversy, in order that the
extraordinary writ of 
certiorari
 will lie.â
[27]
 After a thorough review of
the case, we find that the NLRCâs assailed decision was based on the extant
evidence.  It was not tainted with abuse
of discretion; much less, 
grave
 abuse of discretion.  Clearly, petitioner failed to discharge its
burden of  proving (1) 
substantial
losses
 and (2) the 
reasonable necessity
 of retrenchment.  


Insufficient Proof of Substantial Losses


To
prove its loss, petitioner presented only its financial statements for the
fiscal year that ended on December 31, 1992.
[28]
 These financial statements
show that the petitionerâs gross income was 
P
7,451,981.35 and -- deducting
therefrom the cost of goods sold, which was 
P
4,843,787.87, and the
operating expenses of 
P
2,714,835.15 -- the net loss was 
P
106,641.67.  This net loss plus the deficit as of January
1, 1992, which was 
P
286,354.71, resulted in the total loss of 
P
392,996.38
as of the end of 1992.


These,
however,  fall far short of the
stringent requirement of the law that the employer prove sufficiently and
convincingly its allegation of substantial losses.  The failure of petitioner to show its income or loss for the immediately
preceding years or to prove that it expected no abatement of such losses in the
coming years bespeaks the weakness of its cause.  The financial statement for 1992, by itself, does not
sufficiently prove petitionerâs allegation that it âalready suffered actual
serious losses,â
[29]
 because it does not show
whether its losses increased or decreased.  Although petitioner posted a loss for 1992,  it is also possible that such loss was considerably less than
those previously incurred, thereby indicating the companyâs improving
condition.
[30]
 


Hence,
in 
AG&P,
[31]
 the employer sufficiently
proved its case when it presented proof that its income continuously decreased
from 
P
205 million in 1984, 
P
175 million in 1985, to 
P
101
million in 1986 and, eventually, to a loss of 
P
34 million in 1987 prior
to the retrenchment it effected in 1988.  Afterwards, it submitted to the NLRC further evidence showing that it
incurred a loss of 
P
176 million in 1990.  All these proofs showed that its losses were substantial and
urgent enough to justify retrenchment.  In 
North Davao Mining Corporation,
[32]
 
the employer presented
proof that it suffered net losses averaging three billion pesos (
P
3,000,000,000)
a year for five years prior to its closure.  In the instant case, petitioner insists that its total deficit or accumulated
losses as of December 31, 1992 were exactly 98.25% of the stockholderâs equity
for the same year.  This percentage 
by
itself
 does not conclusively prove that the petitioner could have avoided
substantial losses only through retrenchment.  


Indeed, in the analysis of financial statements, â(o)ne
particular percentage or relationship may not be too significant in itselfâ;
that is, it may not suffice to point out those unfavorable characteristics of
the company that would require immediate or even drastic action.
[33]
 In view of petitionerâs
failure to prove that its alleged losses were substantial, continuing and
without any immediate prospect of abating, the bona fide nature of the
retrenchment appears to be seriously in question.
[34]


No Reasonable Necessity for Retrenchment


The
retrenchment is likewise unjustified because petitioner failed to show its
reasonable necessity.  Significantly,
petitioner admits that it âcould have continued its operation despite the
losses it suffered.â
[35]
 It stated, however, that
the notice of strike filed by private respondents indicated that they were
unwilling to help save the business.
[36]
 It assumed that the
planned strike would result in substantial losses, necessitating
retrenchment.  For this reason alone,
petitioner concluded that it âcannot afford to continue operating and suffer
more losses.â Thus, it decided to undertake âthe disputed retrenchment
measure.â
[37]


We
emphasize, however, that petitionerâs mere speculation about the impact on its
income of the notice  of strike -- or
even  the  strike itself -- is neither a proof that it actually sustained
substantial losses nor an indication of the reasonable necessity of
retrenchment.  In 
Guerrero,
38
 
the Court rejected the âcompanyâs
contention that it was not necessary to present proof of severity of losses it
sustained since [the dismissed employees] were aware of the strike and its
adverse effects on the company.â 


Neither
do the alleged losses occasioned by the power crisis hounding the country at
the time show the reasonable necessity of retrenchment.  On the contrary, petitioner had already
implemented a response to the energy crisis by adjusting the companyâs work
schedule to 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. to avoid the scheduled power failure from
4:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.
39
 
It has not demonstrated the inadequacy of this
response.  In any event, it failed to
show the futility of resorting to less drastic measures -- for example, cost
reduction, faster collection on customer accounts, and reducing investment on
raw materials --  to avoid serious
financial and economic problems.  As
aptly found and stated by the labor arbiter:


âIn the instant case, it appears
that the respondent company failed to observe fair and reasonable standards in
effecting the dismissal of complainants.  In fact, the respondents had no program of retrenchment setting the standards
to be observed in selecting those to be retrenched.


It likewise appears that
respondents failed to show that it first instituted cost production measures in
other areas of production.  It will be
observed that based from [sic] the statement of loss for the year 1992
submitted by respondents (Annex â2-Câ, supplemental position paper), cost
production measures could have easily been instituted by management to avoid
incurring losses.  It will be noted that
for the year 1992 the company allegedly incurred a net loss of 
P
106,641.67.  This loss could have been easily avoided by
reducing some of the operating expenses enumerated in the statement of
loss.  For instance, the transportation
and travelling expenses and the meal allowances alone already total 
P
204,770.16
(
P
106,973.60 + 
P
97,796.56)[.  A] perusal of the statement of loss reveals that there are other
operating expenses that could admit little adjustments.


This Office is not
impressed by the contention of respondents that the retrenchment under consideration
was done by them in good faith for the evidence shows that it was effected
after a notice of strike was filed by the complainants in view of the
respondents[,] failure to pay them certain benefits in pursuance of their CBA.â
 
40


Clearly,
petitioner had no legal basis to dismiss the private respondents as it was not
able to prove the urgency and reasonable necessity of retrenchment.  Indeed, the inevitable conclusion is that
private respondents were illegally dismissed.
41


Incidental
Matters


Petitioner
points to  other  cases, 
i.e.,
 NLRC Case Nos.
00-09-05985-93, 00-06-04513-94, and 00-09-06029-93, which involved the same
factual backdrop as that of the present case, and which were decided in favor
of the employers.
42
 
The petitioner is clutching at straws.  The only material consideration in this
appeal is whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering its
assailed decision.  Based on the
foregoing discussion, it is ineludible that, in this case, Public Respondent
NLRCâs decision was not arbitrarily or despotically rendered, but was based on
the extant evidence.  In so deciding, it
did not commit grave abuse of discretion, and its factual findings are perforce
accorded deference and finality by this Court.  We reiterate that the NLRCâs evaluation  of the evidence, specially that involving the factual issue of whether
petitioner sufficiently proved the essential requisites of retrenchment in the
case before us, is beyond the scope of our review under Rule 65 of the Rules of
Court.


Finally,
both parties concur that the name of Private Respondent Roberto Goce does not
appear on the list of employees and, thus, is not entitled to an award.
43
 
However, the solicitor
general points out that, as in Goceâs case, the names of Private Respondents
Renato Yape and Almer Arboleda were not included in the computation of claims
filed by counsel for the complainants, but that petitioner admitted that the
two were its employees and, as such, included in the said list of its
employees.  The solicitor general further
finds the following to be insufficient for determining the employment of Goce
with petitioner: Goceâs complaint against the petitioner, his claim to be the
latterâs messenger, his eventual inclusion in the computation made by the
Research and Information Office of the Arbitration Branch and  the grant to him of the âfourth highest
award.â  Hence, the solicitor general
recommends that Goceâs case be remanded to the labor arbiter for the purpose of
determining this question.
44
 
We agree.  Justice demands that this factual question be finally threshed out in a
remand of the case to the labor arbiter to finally give petitioner and Private
Respondent Roberto Goce their due.  


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DISMISSED
and the assailed Resolution is hereby AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that
Roberto Goceâs name be deleted from the award and that his complaint be
remanded to the labor arbiter.  Costs
against petitioner.

 When employees are illegally dismissed, they are
normally entitled to reinstatement, in addition to back wages.  However, we cannot order reinstatement in
this case because the private respondents did not appeal the LAâs (and the
NLRCâs) decision omitting such relief.
