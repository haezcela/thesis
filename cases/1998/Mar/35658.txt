BELLOSILLO, J.:


W H I L E  the Constitution is committed to the policy
of social justice and the protection of the working class, it should not be
supposed that every labor dispute would automatically be decided in favor of
labor.  Management also has it own
rights which, as such, are entitled to respect and enforcement in the interest
of simple fair play. Out of its concern for those with less privileges in life,
this Court has inclined more often than not toward the worker and upheld his
cause in his conflicts with the employer.  Such favoritism, however, has not blinded us to the rule that justice is
in every case for the deserving, to be dispensed in the light of  the established facts and the applicable law
and doctrine.
[1]


On 31 October
1985 The Security Professionals, Inc. (TSPI), and Apex Mining Co., Inc. (APEX)
entered into a contract whereby the former bound itself to supply security
personnel to the latter for its security requirements at its Masara minesite
operations, Maco, Davao del Norte.
[2]
 Pursuant to their agreement
Rizalino Z. Alcosero and many others were assigned at the minesite of APEX at
Masara either as  officers, supervisors,
contractual personnel or security guards.  The agreement between TSPI and APEX remained in force, subject only to periodic
adjustments regarding the amount of consideration until sometime  in  1992 when APEX closed down its Masara minesite due to serious business
losses and financial reverses.
[3]
 


On 21 July 1992
Rizalino Z. Alcosero, for himself and in behalf of 260 other complainants,
[4]
 wrote a letter addressed to the
Regional Director, Regional Office No. XI, Department of Labor and Employment
(DOLE), presenting their claims for unpaid wages and 13th month pay against
APEX.
[5]
 The letter was indorsed to the
Regional  Arbitration  Branch  No.  XI,  Davao City, for appropriate action.  On the basis thereof, APEX was invited on
27 July 1992 to a conference before Labor Arbiter Antonio M. Villanueva.
[6]
 During the conference, complainants
submitted  a  so-called  certificate  of  net  collectibles  representing  the unpaid wages and 13th month pay of about
311 security personnel for the calendar years 1990 and 1991, and for the period
from January to  May 1992, with the
following computations: 
P
3,225,110.52 (January-December 1990); 
P
5,656,041.88
(January-December 1991); 
P
2,525,858.93 (January-May 1992); and, 
P
11,407,011.33
as total actual collectibles.
[7]


Represented by
its counsel, Atty. Ruben V. Abarquez, and its Officer-In-Charge for Operations,
Engr. Alexander D. Tulio, APEX expressed conformity as to its liability for
unpaid wages and 13th month pay for the calendar year 1990 amounting to 
P
3,225,110.52
but denied the rest of the claim.  Accordingly, on 3 August 1992, the Labor Arbiter issued an order
requiring APEX to pay the uncontested amount of  
P
3,225,110.52 within twenty (20) days from receipt of the
order.


On 15 August
1992 the Labor Arbiter issued a notice of levy against the properties of APEX
and eventually a notice of sale thereof for the purpose of executing his 3 August
1992 Order.  But APEX moved to hold in
abeyance the sale of its properties, manifesting that it would pay and settle
all its obligations due the complainants.  Then, on different dates in December 1992 and January 1993, it paid
complainants and the latter signed the corresponding receipts and quitclaims
therefor.
[8]
 


Later,
complainants asserted that the payments made to them pertained to their unpaid
wages and 13th month pay for the year 1990 only.  At the succeeding hearing held on 19 November 1992, complainants
submitted another certificate of net collectibles for the years 1991 and 1992,
with added claims for vacation and sick  leave  pay, and uniform
allowances.
 
This prompted
the Labor Arbiter to issue an order dated 10 February 1993 directing APEX to
submit its comment on the issue of unpaid wages, 13th month pay, leave pay and
allowances for the years 1991 and 1992.  But APEX failed to comment thereon despite reasonable time granted by
the Labor Arbiter, and repeatedly failed to comply with subsequent orders of
the Labor Arbiter requiring it to file its position paper.  It was not until 23 July 1993 that private
respondent was finally able to submit its position paper, but by then the Labor
Arbiter had already resolved the case and awarded complainants a total of 
P
5,287,055.29
plus 10% of the amount as attorneyâs fees. Incidentally, during the pendency of
the case before the Labor Arbiter, some of the complainants withdrew from the
case either verbally or by personally  erasing  their  names  in  the  Special  Power  of  Attorney.
[9]
 Hence, out of the original 260
complainants, only 131 continued to prosecute the case.  These 131 remaining complainants were later
joined in by 5 others, thereby raising the number of complainants to 136.  Thus, the Labor Arbiter clarified that his
decision should apply only to the 136 complainants, but without prejudice to
the others who might subsequently pursue their legitimate claims.


APEX appealed to
the NLRC
 
on 15 August 1993 assailing the decision of the Labor
Arbiter.
[10]
 Instead of posting an appeal bond,
however, APEX filed in lieu thereof a motion for the reduction of the appeal
bond seven (7) days from its receipt of the Labor Arbiterâs decision.  After due consideration, the NLRC on 4 May
1994 promulgated a resolution providing in part that APEX had already paid
all  the  claims  due  to  complainants  in  connection  with  this  case  as evidenced by the individual receipts and quitclaims executed by the
latter.  There being no allegation that
complainants were forced or pressured into signing the receipts and quitclaims,
the NLRC sustained as valid the aforementioned documents.  Accordingly, the Labor Arbiter's decision
was ordered vacated and set aside, and the above entitled case dismissed for
lack of merit.
[11]
 Hence, the instant petition for 
certiorari

questioning the resolution of the NLRC.


Preliminarily,
we noted that herein petitioners elevated this case to us on 
certiorari

under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court without previously filing a motion for reconsideration
of the NLRC decision. One of the petitioners, Oscar Atup, explained to the
Court in the form of a certification the reason for his failure thus - 


This is to certify
that I, OSCAR ATUP, have signed this Special Civil Action for 
Certiorari
 in this case, in lieu of our former representative,
Rizalino Z. Alcosero, whom we have deputized to represent us and sign all
documents, papers and submissions relative to our complaint/case as principal
complainant. This is done so on account of failure and refusal of said Rizalino
Z. Alcosero, for unknown reasons to see our counsel and sign these submissions
after Presiding Commissioner Musib M. Buat and two (2) others reversed the
Decision of Labor Arbiter Antonio M. Villanueva.


This further certifies the fact
that the failure to file Motion for Reconsideration from the resolution of the
Commission was due to the aforesaid reasons, coupled with the delay in
contacting other complainants who have dispersed temporarily to look for other
means of livelihood.


Our quest for justice regarding our
unpaid earned wages is the sole reason why we executed this Certification and
the filing of 
Certiorari
 with this Honorable Supreme Court.


It is settled
that the filing of a motion for reconsideration of the order, resolution or
decision of the tribunal, board or office is, subject to well-recognized
exceptions, a condition 
sine qua non
  to the institution of a special civil action for 
certiorari
.  The rationale therefor is that the law
intends to afford  the  tribunal,  board  or  office  an  opportunity  to rectify  the errors and mistakes it  may  have lapsed into before  resort  to the courts of justice can be had.
[12]
 Petitionersâ explanation concerning
their failure to move for reconsideration is not sufficient justification for
dispensing with the requirement.  In
fact, it is not even among the recognized exceptions to the above rule. 
Certiorari

cannot  be resorted to as a shield from
the adverse consequences of petitionersâ own omission to file the required motion
for reconsideration.
[13]


It is worth
stressing, since so often it is overlooked, that 
certiorari
 will lie
only if there is no appeal nor any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law against the acts of the NLRC.  In the instant case, the remedy expressly
provided by law was a motion for reconsideration, which was not only expected
to be but would actually have provided an adequate and more speedy remedy than
the present petition for 
certiorari
.
[14]


Also, Sec. 2,
pars. (a), (b) and (c), Rule VIII, of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC
specifically provides for the finality of the decision of the Commission after
the lapse of the 10-day reglementary period â 


(a) 
Finality of the decisions,
resolutions or orders of the Commission
.  -  Except as provided in Rule XI,
Section 2, the decisions, resolutions or orders of the Commission/Division
shall become executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the same. 


(b) 
Effect of filing of a motion
for reconsideration
.  -  Should there  be a motion for reconsideration entertained pursuant to Section
14, 


Rule VII of these rules, the
decision shall be executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the
resolution on such motion. 


(c) 
Entry of judgment
.  -  Upon the expiration of the ten (10) calendar day period provided in the
preceding paragraph, the order/resolution shall, immediately thereafter, be
entered in the book of entry of judgment  
(underscoring supplied).


Thus, without
the required motion for reconsideration nothing prevented the resolution of the
NLRC from becoming final and executory.  Petitioners cannot now, by an overdue strategy, question the correctness
of the resolution.


On the basis of
the foregoing discussion alone, the instant petition should already be dismissed.  Nonetheless, for the satisfaction
particularly of petitioners, we shall traverse their arguments and demonstrate
their utter lack of merit.


Petitioners
contend that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction in entertaining the appeal of APEX notwithstanding that
the assailed decision of the Labor Arbiter had long become final and executory
for failure of APEX to file the required appeal bond within the reglementary
period of ten (10) days, which bond was an indispensable requirement for the
perfection of the appeal.


Ordinarily,
where the losing party desires to appeal from the decision of the Labor Arbiter
it must be done within ten (10) days from receipt of the decision.
[15]
 
When the judgment involves a
monetary award, an appeal by the employer may be perfected only upon the
posting of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company
duly  accredited  by  the  NLRC  or  the  Supreme  Court  in  an  amount equivalent to the monetary award  in  the  judgment  appealed  from.
[16]
 
Compliance with these requirements
is both mandatory and  imperative as the
perfection  of  an  appeal within the
reglementary period is  jurisdictional.
[17]
 
But in a growing  number of cases, we have relaxed the
stringent application of the rule concerning the posting of appeal bond within
the 10-day reglementary period as a requirement for the perfection of an
appeal.  Thus, in the leading case of
Star Angel Handicraft v. National Labor Relations Commission,
[18]
 
we held â


Neither the Labor Code nor its
implementing rules specifically provide for a situation where the appellant
moves for a reduction of the appeal bond. Inasmuch as in practice the NLRC
allows the reduction of the appeal bond upon motion of appellant and on meritorious
grounds, it follows that a motion to that effect may be filed within the
reglementary period for appealing. Such motion may be filed in lieu of a bond
which amount is being contested. In the meantime, the appeal is deemed
perfected and the Labor Arbiter retains jurisdiction over the case until the
NLRC has acted on the motion and appellant has filed the bond as fixed by the
NLRC.


We have, therefore, relaxed the
requirement of the posting of an appeal bond as a condition for perfecting an
appeal under Art. 223 of the Labor Code.  In 
Erectors, Inc. v. NLRC,
  we nullified an order of the NLRC which required the appellant to post a
bond of 
P
575,222.00 within ten (10) days from receipt of the order or
suffer the dismissal of the appeal. The bond therein required was based on the
award which was erroneously computed based on the salary which the employee was
no longer receiving at the time of his separation and âwhich even included in
the computation the award of 
P
400,000.00 for moral and exemplary
damages.â


Moreover, under
Rule VI, Sec. 6, of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure, the Commission may, in
meritorious cases and upon motion of the appellant, reduce the amount of the
bond.  However, an appeal is deemed
perfected only upon the posting of the bond equivalent to the monetary award
exclusive of moral and exemplary damages as well as attorneyâs fees. 


In this case,
APEX filed in lieu of an appeal bond a motion for the reduction of the bond
together with the Memorandum of Appeal seven (7) days from receipt of the Labor
Arbiterâs decision.  The NLRC held that
the appeal of APEX was founded on meritorious grounds, hence, it gave due
course to the same despite the fact that no appeal bond was posted at that
time.  The NLRC could not be faulted
for doing so since it had authority to entertain motions for the reduction of
the appeal bond.  And when APEX posted
the required bond within the extended period granted by the NLRC, it was deemed
to have seasonably perfected its appeal.


Petitioners then
argue that it was grave abuse of discretion for the NLRC to reverse the
decision of the Labor Arbiter and hold that the receipts and quitclaims
represented a full settlement of all the workersâ claims, although petitioners
made it clear before the Labor Arbiter that they were still pursuing their
entitlements for 1991 and 1992.


We do not
agree.  


First
.  
The subject
receipts and quitclaims provide almost uniformly thus -


Receipt and Quitclaim


Received from APEX Mining Co.,
Inc., respondent/s the amount of PESOS: 
full payment
 of the
above-entitled case.


That in consideration of the amount
herein above-mentioned receipt of which I/We hereby acknowledged, I/We declare
that I/We have no more claim against the above-named respondent/s and therefore
release and discharge APEX Mining Company, Inc. from whatever claims and
liabilities arising out of and in connection with this case.


We therefore request the Regional
Arbitration Branch No. XI of the National Labor Relations Commission to
consider this case CLOSED  and  TERMINATED.


It may be
observed that in the herein quoted "Receipt and  Quitclaim,"  which
exemplifies the terms of the agreement between private respondent APEX and
petitioners for the release of their claims,  there is nothing that states that petitioners reserved their right to
pursue whatever claims they still had against APEX.  On the other hand, the subject receipts and quitclaims are clear
and absolute on their faces, i.e., they completely discharged APEX from
whatever liabilities might be due petitioners.  Further, note that under the third paragraph petitioners even
requested the Regional Arbitration Branch to consider the case terminated.  


Second
.
  Significantly, petitioners signed the subject documents on different
dates in December 1992 and January 1993.  The inescapable conclusion is that the receipts and quitclaims were
meant to fully discharge APEX from whatever amounts were still due the
petitioners, including their supposedly unpaid wages for 1991 and 1992.


Third.
  The documents were in standard "Receipt and Quitclaim" forms
prepared by the Regional Arbitration Branch of DOLE, all of which were duly
signed before Labor Arbiter Antonio M. Villanueva and witnessed by
representatives of the Regional Arbitration Branch XI of DOLE.  Therefore, if it was true that the payments
made by APEX applied only to the 1990 claims, the Labor Arbiter should have
indicated that fact in the individual receipts and quitclaims; and


Fourth
.
 
We discern
nothing from the records that would suggest that petitioners were coerced,
intimidated or deceived into signing the subject receipts and quitclaims.  On the contrary, petitioners never denied
that they signed the documents voluntarily.  In fact, they never even for a moment assailed the genuineness and due
execution of those documents.  Neither
are we convinced that the amounts received by petitioners as consideration for
the quitclaims were scandalously low as to render the quitclaims
inequitable.  There being no
countervailing proof presented by petitioners other than their bare  and unsubstantiated allegations, it must be
presumed that they were satisfied when they signed the receipts and quitclaims
that the settlement reached was just and reasonable.  They cannot thereafter renege on the agreement simply because
they now feel they made a mistake in signing the quitclaims.


In this
connection, it must be underscored that petitioners were supervisors, officers
and security guards of TSPI and, as such, are better off in general than the
average laborer in terms of educational attainment.  Hence, it may safely be assumed that they knew the legal
implications of what they were signing.


Finally, while
quitclaims executed by employees are commonly frowned upon as contrary to
public policy and are ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of the
employeesâ legal rights,
[19]
 
there are legitimate waivers that
represent a voluntary and reasonable settlement of laborersâ claims which
should be respected by the courts as the law between the parties.  Thus, in Periquet v. National Labor
Relations Commission  we held
[20]
-


Not all waivers and quitclaims are
invalid as against public policy. If the agreement was voluntarily entered into
and represents a reasonable settlement, it is binding on the parties and may
not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind.  It is only where there is clear  proof  that  the  waiver  was  wangled  from  an  unsuspecting  or gullible person, or the terms of the
settlement are unconscionable on its face, that the law will step in to annul
the questionable transaction. But where it is shown that the person making the
waiver did so voluntarily, with full understanding of what he was doing, and
the consideration for the quitclaim is credible and reasonable, the transaction
must be recognized as a valid and binding undertaking. 


So it is,
likewise, in the instant case.
 


WHEREFORE
, petition is DISMISSED. The
assailed resolution of 4 May 1994 of the National Labor Relations Commission -
which VACATED and SET ASIDE  the
decision of the Labor Arbiter awarding petitioner a total of 
P
5,287,055.29
plus 10% of the amount as
 
attorney's fees, and completely absolved
private respondent APEX Mining Co
., 
Inc
.,
  from all liabilities to petitioners  - is AFFIRMED.  No costs.
