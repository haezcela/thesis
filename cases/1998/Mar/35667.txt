ROMERO, J.:


Petitioners Manila Midtown Hotels
Land Corporation, Robinsonâs Inn, Inc., John Gokongwei Jr. and Olive G. Berge
assail the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated
December 21, 1994,
[1]
 declaring them jointly and severally liable together
with CISCOR for the unpaid money claims due to the private respondents in the
amount of 
P
1,385,181.00.


Confidential Investigation and
Security Corporation (CISCOR) is a private corporation whose main line of
business is providing security services towards its clients, among whom are
petitioners Manila Midtown Hotel and Robinsonâs Inn, Inc.
[2]


On various dates, private
respondents were hired as security guards by CISCOR and subsequently assigned
to either the Manila Midtown Hotel or Robinsonâs Inn.  However, on October 9, 1991, private respondents, numbering about
seventy-seven, filed a complaint against CISCOR and the petitioners for illegal
dismissal, illegal deduction, underpayment, premium pay for holiday, premium
pay for rest day, holiday pay, uniform allowance and service incentive leave
pay.  Pending conciliation proceedings,
twenty-eight (28) of the original complainants filed a motion to dismiss
stating that they had amicably settled their grievances with the petitioners.


During the trial, CISCOR merely
denied any monetary liability while Manila Midtown Hotel and Robinsonâs Inn
contended that under their respective contracts with CISCOR, the latter was
responsible for the payment of any money claims and benefits due to the private
respondents.  Moreover, they argued that
they were not privy to the employer-employee relationship between CISCOR and
private respondents.


On December 23, 1992, while the
case was still pending before the Labor Arbiter, the petitioners and CISCOR
executed a Quitclaim and Release
[3]
 which provided:


âx x x
                                
x x x 
                           
x x x


6.
      
It is further
understood that the amount herein received shall cover any and all claims
interposed by several CISCOR security guards against CISCOR and MMCC (MMHH)
with the Department of Labor, now pending before Arbiter Ricardo O. Nora,
insofar as the said case or cases may here be covered or related.â


On November 29, 1993, after the
parties had submitted their respective position papers,
[4]
 the Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of the private
respondents and ordered CISCOR and the petitioners to jointly and severally pay
the monetary claims, the dispositive portion of the decision of which reads as
follows:


âIN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the respondents CISCOR,
Manila Midtown Hotel, Robinsonâs Apartelle and individual respondents Ernesto
Z. Medina, John Gokongwei and Olive Begre are hereby ordered to pay jointly and
severally the above-named complainants in the aggregate sum of ONE MILLION
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE PESOS AND 70/100 (
P
1,385,181.70)
representing their money claims.


The case filed by complainant Melita N. Lacerna should be,
as it is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice in view of the Affidavit of Desistance
dated December 21, 1992 which she executed.


All other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED."


CISCOR did not appeal the Labor Arbiter's decision but
petitioners challenged the ruling before the NLRC.  In a decision dated December 21, 1994, the NLRC, while modifying
the monetary amounts to be awarded, upheld the solidary liability of CISCOR and
the petitioners, thus:


"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby
MODIFIED, but only to the extent that only respondent CISCOR shall be liable
for the periods (appearing in pages 224 and 225 of the records) when some of
the complainants were assigned, not to respondents Robinsonâs Apartelle and/or
Manila Midtown Hotel, but to other principals of respondent CISCOR.  In all other respects, the decision appealed
from is hereby AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.â


Instead of filing the required
motion for reconsideration,
[5]
 petitioners filed this instant petition alleging that
the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in holding them liable with CISCOR for
the unpaid monetary claims.


To begin with, the failure of the
petitioners to file the required motion for reconsideration is fatal to this
petition.  In numerous cases,
[6]
 we have consistently held that a motion for
reconsideration is indispensable for it affords the NLRC an opportunity to
rectify errors or mistakes it might have committed before resort to the court
can be availed of.
[7]


In the recent case of 
ABS-CBN
Employees Union and Jose Entradicho 
v.
 NLRC
,
[8]
 we expounded on the rationale of such remedy, thus:


âx x x  The
unquestioned rule in this jurisdiction is that certiorari will lie only if
there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the
ordinary course of law against acts of the public respondents.  In the instant case, the plain and adequate
remedy expressly provided by the law was a motion for reconsideration of the
assailed decision, based on palpable or patent errors, to be made under oath
and filed within ten (10) days from receipt of the questioned order."


Accordingly, the non-filing by the
petitioners of their respective motions for reconsideration warrants the
outright dismissal of the instant petition.  In the absence of a motion for reconsideration seasonably filed within
the ten-day reglementary period, the assailed order, resolution or decision of
the NLRC, becomes final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt
thereof.
[9]
 The merits of the case can no longer be reviewed to
determine the existence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.
[10]


It should be stressed that
petitioners cannot escape the rigid observance of the necessity to file a
motion for reconsideration since such requirement is jurisdictional,
[11]
 and the same may not be brushed aside as âmere
technicalityâ to suit their interest.  
Certiorari
,
being an extraordinary remedy,
[12]
 the party who seeks to avail of the same must observe
the rules laid down by law.  Rule 65 of
the then Rules of Court provides:


âx x x
                                
x x x
                            
x
x x


The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy
of the judgment or order subject thereof, together with copies of all pleadings
and documents relevant and pertinent thereto.â


In this regard, we have ruled that
the failure of a party to attach the required documents to his petition will
cause the dismissal thereof.
[13]


Needless to say, the omission of
petitionersâ counsel to file the required motion for reconsideration was simply
inexcusable.  It should be observed that
the assailed decision of the NLRC was rendered on December 21, 1994; however,
as early as 1989 we had the occasion to stress that:


âPetitioner, cannot, on its bare and self-serving
representation that reconsideration is not necessary, unilaterally disregard
what the law requires and deny the respondent NLRC its right to review its
pronouncement before being haled (sic) to court to account therefor.  On policy reconsideration, such prerequisite
would provide an expeditious termination of labor disputes and asserts the
decongestions of Court dockets by obviating improvident and unnecessary
recourse to judicial proceedings.  The
present case exemplifies the very contingency sought to be, and which could
have been, avoided by the observance of said rules.â
[14]


Procedural rules, like all rules, are
required to be followed except only for the most persuasive reasons when they
can be relaxed.
[15]


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is
hereby DISMISSED.  Costs against
petitioner.


SO ORDERED.
