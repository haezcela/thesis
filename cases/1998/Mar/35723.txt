BENGUET ELECTRIC
COOPERATIVE, INC. COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ERNESTO B. FLORES, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The profession
of law exacts the highest standards from its members and brooks no violation of
its code of conduct.  Accordingly, a
lawyer who trifles with judicial processes, engages in forum shopping and
blatantly lies in his pleadings must be sanctioned.


The Case


This is an
administrative complaint against Atty. Ernesto Flores filed by Benguet Electric
Cooperative, Inc. (BENECO) before this Court on July 5, 1993, seeking his
removal or suspension from the bar for forum shopping, which amounted to âgrave
misconduct, x x x unduly delaying the administration of justice, and violating
with impunity his oath of office and applicable laws and jurisprudence.â
[1]


After the
respondent submitted his Comment, dated August 21, 1993, we referred the case
to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) on September 27, 1993 for
investigation, report and recommendation.  On August 15, 1997, we received a resolution from the IBP Board of
Governors, finding respondent guilty of violating Canons 10 and 12 of the Code
of Professional Responsibility and recommending his suspension from the
practice of law for a period of six months, 
viz
:


âRESOLUTION NO. XII-97-149


Adm. Case NO. 4058


Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs.


Atty. Ernesto B. Flores


RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby
ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating
Commissioner in the above-entitled case, hereinmade [sic] part of this
Resolution/Decision as Annex âAâ; and finding the recommendation therein to be
fully supported by the evidence on record and the applicable laws and rules,
Respondent Atty. Ernesto Flores is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law
for six (6) months for violating the provision of Canon[s] 10 and 12 of the
Code of Professional Responsibility.â
[2]


The Facts


Because the
parties
[3]
 
agreed to dispense with the
presentation of testimonial evidence, the case was submitted for resolution on
the basis of their documentary evidence.  As found by Investigating Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose, the facts are
as follows:


âx x x.  On
February 25, 1993, Labor Arbiter Irenarco Rimando of the National Labor
Relations Commission, Regional Arbitration Branch, Cordillera Administrative
Region, Baguio City, issued a Writ of Execution (x x x) in NLRC Case No.
RAB-1-0313-84 to enforce the decision rendered by the Supreme Court on May 18,
1992 in G.R. No. 89070 (Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. NLRC, 209 SCRA
55).  The Writ of Execution was issued
on motion of Benguet Electric Cooperative (BENECO for short) to collect the
amount of 
P
344,000.00 which it paid to Peter Cosalan during the pendency
of the case before the Supreme Court, on the basis of its decision ordering the
respondent board members âto reimburse petitioner BENECO any amount that it may
be compelled to pay to respondent Cosalan by virtue of the decision of Labor
Arbiter Amado T. Adquilen.â


After issuance of the writ of execution, the
respondent, as new counsel for the losing litigant-members of the BENECO Board
of Directors, filed a Motion for Clarification with the Third Division of the
Supreme Court in G.R. No. 89070, the minute resolution to wit:  âto note without action the aforesaid
motionâ.


Thereafter, the respondent instituted a suit docketed
as Civil Case NO. 2738-R (x x x) with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 7,
Baguio City, seeking to enjoin the defendants Clerk of Court, et al. from levying
on their properties in satisfaction of the said writ of execution.  That case, however, was dismissed by the
Presiding Judge Clarence Villanueva in his Order dated March 18, 1993 (x x x).


Accordingly, the Office of the Clerk of Court, MTC,
Baguio City, through Sheriff III Wilfredo Mendez, proceeded to levy on the
properties of the losing board members of BENECO.  Thus, a sale at public auction was set on June 1, 1993, at 10:00
oâclock in the morning in front of the Baguio City Hall, per Sheriffâs Notice
of Sale dated May 4, 1993 (x x x), of the properties of Abundio Awal and
Nicasio Aliping[,] two of the losing members of the Board of Directors of
BENECO in the aforementioned case.


Respondent claims in his comment (x x x) that Branch
7, motu proprio, dismissed Civil Case No. 2738-R for lack of jurisdiction on
March 18,1993, which dismissal was [sic] became final due to respondentâs
failure to perfect an appeal therefrom which claim according to the
complainant, constitute[s] deliberate misrepresentation, if not falsehood,
because the respondent indeed interposed an appeal such that on May 11, 1993,
the RTC 7 of Baguio City transmitted the entire record of Civil Case No. 2738-R
to the Court of Appeals per certified machine copy of the letter transmittal of
same date (x x x).


While respondent ânever essentially intended to
assail the issuance by the NLRC of the Writ of Execution x x x nor sought to
undo itâ (x x x) the complaint in Civil Case No. 2738-R which he filed prays
for the immediate issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary
writ of injunction for defendants Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio City Sheriff to
cease and desist from enforcing  the
execution and levy of the writ of execution issued by the NLRC-CAR, pending
resolution of the main action in said court (x x x) which complainant likewise
claims as an unprocedural maneuver to frustrate the execution of the decision
of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 89070 in complete disregard of settled
jurisprudence that regular courts have no jurisdiction to hear and decide
questions which arise and are incidental to the enforcement of decisions,
orders and awards rendered in labor cases citing the case of Cangco vs. CA, 199
SCRA 677, a display of gross ignorance of the law.


On May
26, 1993, respondent again filed for Abundio Awal and Nicasio Aliping with the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 9, La Trinidad, Benguet, separate complaints for
Judicial Declaration of Family Home Constituted, Ope Lege, and thus Exempt from
Levy and Execution the subject properties with Damages, etc. docketed as Civil
Cases Nos. 93-F-0414 (x x x) and 93-F-0415 (x x x), which are essentially
similar actions to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment rendered in NLRC Case
No. RAB-1-0313-84.  He also filed an
urgent Motion Ex-parte (x x x) praying for temporary restraining order in these
two (2) cases.


The complainant further alleges that respondentâs
claim for damages against the defendant Sheriff is another improper and
unprocedural maneuver which is likewise a violation of respondentâs oath not to
sue on groundless suit since the said Sheriff was merely enforcing a writ of
execution as part of his job.â


Recommendation of the IBP


As noted
earlier, Investigating Commissioner Plaridel C. Jose recommended, and the IBP
Board of Governors concurred, that respondent be suspended from the bar for six
months for:  


1.
 
Falsehood,
for stating in his comment before this Court that the order of the RTC
dismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. 2738-R was not appealed on time


2.
 
Failure
to comply with Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 on forum shopping


Commissioner Jose ratiocinated:


âA cursory glance of (sic) x x x
the complaint filed by the respondent in Civil Case No. 2738-R before the RTC
of Baguio City, which complaint was signed and verified under oath by the
respondent, reveals that it lacks the certification required by Supreme Court
Circular No. 28-91 which took effect on January 1, 1992 to the effect that âto
the best of his knowledge, no such action or proceeding is pending in the
Supreme Court, Court of Appeals or different divisions thereof or any tribunal
or agency.  If there is any other action
pending, he must state the status of the same.  If he should learn that a similar action or proceeding has been filed or
pending before the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals or different divisions
thereof or any tribunal or agency[,] he should notify the court, tribunal or
agency within five (5) days from such notice.â


âAmong the other penalties, the
said circular further provides that the lawyer may also be subjected to
disciplinary proceedings for non-compliance thereof.


âIn sum, it is clear that the
respondent violated the provisions of Canon[s] 10 and 12 of the Code of
Professional Responsibility under which the lawyer owes candor, fairness and
good faith to the court and exert[s] every effort and consider[s] it his duty
to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.â
[4]


This Courtâs Ruling


We adopt and
affirm the recommendation of the IBP suspending the respondent from the bar,
but we increase the period from six (6) months to one (1) year and six (6)
months.


Forum Shopping


Circular No.
28-91,
[5]
 dated
September 4, 1991 which took effect on January 1, 1992, requires a certificate
of non-forum shopping to be attached to petitions filed before this Court and
the Court of Appeals.  This circular was
revised on February 8, 1994.  The IBP
found that the respondent had violated it, because the complaint he filed
before the RTC of Baguio City âlack[ed] the certification required by Supreme
Court Circular No. 28-91.â
[6]
 


We
distinguish.  Respondentâs failure to
attach the said certificate cannot be deemed a violation of the aforementioned
circular, because the said requirement applied only to petitions filed with
this Court and the Court of Appeals.
[7]
 Likewise
inapplicable is Administrative Circular No. 04-94 dated February 8, 1994 which
extended the requirement of a certificate of non-forum shopping to all
initiatory pleadings filed in all courts and quasi-judicial agencies other than
this Court and the Court of Appeals.  Circular No. 04-94 became effective only on April 1, 1994, but the
assailed complaint for injunction was filed on March 18, 1993, and the petition
for the constitution of a family home was instituted on May 26, 1993.


Be that as it
may, respondent is still guilty of forum shopping.  In 
Chemphil Export and Import Corporation vs. Court of
Appeals,
[8]
 this
Court declared that â(t)he rule against forum shopping has long been
established and subsequent circulars
[9]
 of this
Court merely formalized the prohibition and provided the appropriate penalties
against transgressors.â  The prohibition
is found in Section 1(e) of Rule 16 and Section 4 of Rule 2 of the 1964 Rules
of Court, which provide:


âSECTION 1.  
Grounds.
 -- Within the time for
pleading, a motion to dismiss the action may be made on any of the following
grounds:


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx


(e)
     
That
there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause;


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx
[10]


âSEC. 4. 
Effect of splitting a
single cause of action
. -- If two or more complaints are brought for
different parts of a single cause of action, the filing of the first may be
pleaded in abatement of the other or others, in accordance with section 1 (e) of
Rule 16, and a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a bar in the
others.â
[11]


The prohibition
is also contained in Circular No. 28-91.  This circular  did not only
require that a certification of non-forum shopping be attached to the petitions
filed before this Court or the Court of Appeals; it also decreed that forum
shopping constituted direct contempt of court and  could subject the offending lawyer to disciplinary action.  The third paragraph thereof reads:


â3. 
Penalties.


(a) Any violation of this Circular
shall be a cause for the summary dismissal of the multiple petition or
complaint.


(b) 
Any willful and deliberate
forum shopping by any party and his lawyer wit the filing of multiple petitions
and complaints to ensure favorable action shall constitute direct contempt of
court
.


(c) The submission of false
certification under Par. 2 of the Circular shall likewise constitute contempt
of Court, without prejudice to the filing of criminal action against the guilty
party.  
The lawyer may also be
subjected to disciplinary proceedings
.â (Underscoring supplied.)


The foregoing
were substantially reproduced in Revised Circular No. 28-91
[12]
 
and Administrative Circular No.
04-94.
[13]


In a long line
of cases, this Court has held that forum shopping exists when, as a result of
an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than
by appeal or certiorari) in another,
[14]
 or when he institutes  two  or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble
that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.
[15]
 The most
important factor in determining the existence of forum shopping is the
âvexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different
courts to rule on the same or related causes or grant the same or substantially
the same reliefs.â
[16]


After this Court
rendered its Decision
[17]
 in 
Benguet Electric Cooperative,
Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.
[18]
 
and upon motion
of BENECO, Labor Arbiter Irenarco R. Rimando issued a writ of execution
[19]
 ordering
the clerk of court and ex officio city sheriff of the Municipal Trial Court of
Baguio City to levy on and sell at public auction personal and real property of
the members of the Board of Directors of BENECO.


On March 18,
1993, Respondent Flores, acting as counsel for BENECO Board Members Victor
Laoyan, Nicasio Aliping, Lorenzo Pilando and Abundio Awal, filed with the RTC
an injunction suit praying for the issuance of a temporary restraining order
(TRO) âto preserve the 
status quo
 as now obtaining between the parties,â
as well as a writ of preliminary preventive injunction ordering the clerk of
court and the ex officio city sheriff of the MTC of Baguio to âcease and desist
from enforcing by execution and levy the writ of execution from the NLRC-CAR,
pending resolution of the main action raised in court.â
[20]
 


When this
injunction case was dismissed, Respondent Flores filed with another branch of
the RTC two identical but separate actions both entitled âJudicial Declaration
of Family Home Constituted, 
ope lege
,
 Exempt from Levy and
Execution; with Damages, etc.,â docketed as Civil Case Nos. 93-F-0414 and
93-F-0415.
[21]
 The said
complaints were supplemented by an âUrgent Motion Ex Parteâ
[22]
 which
prayed for an order to temporarily restrain Sheriff Wilfredo V. Mendez from
proceeding with the auction sale of plaintiffsâ property âto avoid rendering
ineffectual and functus [oficio] any judgment of the court later in this [sic]
cases, until further determined by the court.â


Civil Case Nos.
93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415 are groundless suits.  
Modequillo vs. Breva
,
[23]

reiterated in 
Manacop vs. Court of Appeals
,
[24]
 shows the
frivolity of these proceedings:


âUnder the Family Code, a family
home is deemed constituted on a house and lot from the time it is occupied as a
family residence.  There is no need to
constitute the same judicially or extrajudicially as required in the Civil
Code.  If the family actually resides in
the premises, it is, therefore, a family home as contemplated by law.  Thus, the creditors should take the
necessary precautions to protect their interest before extending credit to the
spouses or head of the family who owns the home.


xxx.


The exemption provided as
aforestated is effective from the time of the constitution of the family home
as such, and lasts so long as any of its beneficiaries actually resides
therein.â


Adhering to the
Courtâs declaration in said cases, the subject properties are deemed
constituted as family homes by operation of law under Article 153 of the Family
Code.


The suits for
the constitution of a family home were not only frivolous and unnecessary;  they were clearly asking for reliefs
identical to the prayer previously dismissed by another branch of the RTC, 
i.e.,

to forestall the execution of a final judgment of the labor arbiter.  That they were  filed  ostensibly  for  the judicial declaration of a family home was a mere smoke screen; in
essence, their real objective was to restrain or delay the enforcement of the
writ of execution.  In his deliberate
attempt to obtain the same relief in two different courts, Respondent Flores
was obviously shopping for a âfriendlyâ forum which would capitulate to his improvident
plea for an injunction and was thereby trifling with the judicial process.
[25]


We remind the
respondent that, under the Code of Professional Responsibility,
[26]
 he had a
duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.
[27]
 The Code
also enjoins him from unduly delaying a case by impeding the execution of a
judgment or by misusing court processes.
[28]


In consonance
with 
Millare vs. Montero
[29]
 
and 
Garcia vs. Francisco
,
[30]

respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for one year.  In 
Millare
, the respondent filed with
different courts a total of six appeals, complaints and petitions which
frustrated and delayed the execution of a final judgment.  Holding that ârespondent âmade a mockery of
the judicial processesâ and disregarded canons of professional ethics in
intentionally frustrating the rights of a litigant in whose favor a judgment in
the case was rendered [and], thus, âabused procedural rules to defeat the ends
of substantial justice,ââ
[31]
 this
Court suspended the respondent from the practice of law for one year.


In 
Garcia
,
the respondent was also suspended for one year from the practice of law, for
violating the proscription against forum shopping.  This Court held that âhe deserve[d] to be sanctioned, not only as
a punishment for his misconduct but also as a warning to other lawyers who may
be influenced by his example.â
[32]


Falsehood


The
investigating commissioner also held respondent liable for committing a
falsehood because, in this administrative case, he stated in his comment that
he had not âperfected an appeal on the dismissalâ of his petition for
injunction.  In his said comment, the
respondent stated:


âBranch 7 (of the RTC) 
motu
proprio
, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on March 18,
1993.  
Not having perfected an appeal
on the dismissal
, the order of dismissal became final under the Rules 15
days after its receipt by respondent on record, or before April 6, 1993.  So that today this case is 
no longer
pending
.


xxx.


It should be noted that when Civil
Case Nos. 93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415 for family homes and damages were filed in
the court below on May 26, 1993, 
Civil Case NO. 2378-R which seems to give
basis to the present Complaint was deemed terminated, there being no appeal
formally taken and perfected in accordance with the Rules
.


xxx.


And that precisely was the primal
reason why respondent decided not to appeal any further anymore [sic] the order
of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the court below in Civil Case No.
2738, and let it be deemed final by the Rules and jurisprudence.â
[33]
 
(Underscoring supplied.)


The indelible
fact, however,  is that respondent did
file an appeal which was perfected later on.  The original records of the injunction suit had been transmitted to the
appellate court.
[34]
 Moreover,
the Court of Appeals issued a resolution dismissing the appeal.
[35]
 Thus, in
denying that he had appealed the decision of the RTC, respondent was making a
false statement.


Respondent
argues that the withdrawal of his appeal means that no appeal was made under Section
2 of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.  The
pertinent provisions of Rule 50
[36]
read:


âSEC. 2.  
Effect of dismissal
.-- Fifteen (15) days after the
dismissal of an appeal, the clerk shall return to the court below the record on
appeal with a certificate under the seal of the court showing that the appeal
has been dismissed.  Upon the receipt of
such certificate in the lower court the case shall stand there as though no
appeal had ever been taken, and the judgment of the said court may be enforced
with the additional costs allowed by the appellate court upon dismissing the
appeal.â


xxx
  
xxx
                              
xxx


âSEC. 4.  
Withdrawal of appeal
.-- An appeal may be withdrawn as of
right at any time before the filing of appelleeâs brief.  x x x.  The withdrawal of an appeal shall have the same effect as that of a
dismissal in accordance with section 2 of this rule.â


Respondentâs
explanation misses the point.  True, he
withdrew his appeal.  But it is likewise
true that he had actually filed an appeal, and that this was perfected.  False then is his statement that no appeal
was perfected in the injunction suit.  Worse, he made the statement before this Court in order to exculpate
himself, though in vain, from the charge of forum shopping.  


A lawyer must be
a disciple of truth.  Under the Code of
Professional Responsibility, he owes candor, fairness and good faith to the
courts.
[37]
 He shall
neither do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any.  He also has a duty not to mislead or allow
the courts to be misled by any artifice.
[38]


For this
offense, we suspend the respondent from the practice of law for another
year.  True, in 
Ordonio vs. Eduarte
,
[39]
 
Porac
Trucking, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals
[40]
 
and 
Erectors,
Inc. vs. NLRC,
[41]
 we
imposed a suspension of only six months for a similar malfeasance.  But in Floresâ case, his falsehood is
aggravated by its brazenness, for it was committed in an attempt, vain as it
was,  to cover up his forum shopping.
 


Before we close,
we note that this simple case was referred to the IBP on September 27,
1993.  It was deemed submitted for
resolution per the investigating commissionerâs order dated May 10, 1995.  However, the investigating commissioner
submitted his report only on May 5, 1997.  Moreover, the IBP transmitted its recommendation to the Court only
through a letter dated July 31, 1997, which was received by the Office of the
Bar Confidant on August 15, 1997.  Why
it took the IBP almost four years to finish its investigation of the case and
over two years from the date the parties filed their last pleadings to resolve
it escapes us.  After all, the case did
not require any trial-type investigation, and the parties submitted only
documentary evidence to prove or rebut their respective cases.  Thus, we find it opportune to urge the IBP
to hasten the disposition of administrative cases and to remind it that this
Court gives it only ninety days to finish its investigation, report and
recommendation.  Should it require more
time, it should file with the Court a request for extension, giving the reason
for such request.


WHEREFORE
, for trifling with judicial
processes by resorting to forum shopping, Respondent Ernesto B. Flores is
hereby 
SUSPENDED
 from the practice of law for a period of ONE (1) YEAR
and, for violating his oath and the Canon of Professional Responsibility to do
no falsehood, he is 
SUSPENDED
 for another period of ONE (1) YEAR,
resulting in a total period of TWO (2) YEARS, effective upon finality of this
Decision.  He is 
WARNED 
that a
repetition of a similar misconduct will be dealt with more severely.


Let a copy of
this Decision be included in his files which are with the Office of the Bar
Confidant, and circularized to all courts and to the Integrated Bar of the
Philippines.
