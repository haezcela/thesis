DAVIDE, JR., J.:


In this petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule
45 of the Rules of Court, the petitioners ask us to review and set aside that
part of the 12 July 1996 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
SP No. 40285
[2]
 ordering the dismissal of the
petition for suspension of payments filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) insofar as petitioners Alfonso and Elizabeth Co were
concerned.  


The factual
antecedents are summarized by the Court of Appeals as follows:


On 12 May 1995, Modern Paper
Products, Inc. (hereafter, MPPI) and Spouses Alfredo and Elizabeth Co filed
before the Securities and Exchange Commission a Petition for Suspension of
Payments for rehabilitation purposes, docketed as SEC Case No. 05-95-5054,
seeking the following reliefs:


1.
      
Upon
filing of this petition, a temporary restraining order and/or writ of
preliminary injunction be issued restraining and enjoining petitioner MPPIâs
creditors from instituting, prosecuting or in any other manner enforcing any
foreclosures of mortgages, actions or complaints before the courts or any other
tribunal or agency;


2.
      
Petitioners
be declared in a state of suspension of payments, and that an Order be issued
suspending and enjoining the filing, prosecution and/or enforcement of any and
all other claims against petitioners and their properties, whether judicially
or extrajudicially, before any court, tribunal, board or agency;


3.
      
An
Order be issued approving petitionersâ rehabilitation plan and schedule for
deferred payment of petitioner MPPIâs liabilities to its creditors;


4.
      
Petitioner
MPPI be allowed to continue with its business operations and to use the
proceeds or income thereof in accordance with petitioner MPPIâs rehabilitation
plan and schedule of deferred payment; and


5.
      
A
Management Committee be created to oversee the continuation of petitioner
MPPIâs business operations as well as the implementation of petitioner MPPIâs
rehabilitation plan and schedule of deferred payment, and to exercise such
other functions subject to the control and supervision of the Honorable
Commission (Rollo, pp. 55-56).


Pursuant thereto, the Hearing Panel
issued an order setting the petition for hearing.  Accordingly, MPPI met with its creditors, among them Metrobank,
PSBank
*
 and TR Mercantile.  Several hearings were conducted wherein evidences [
sic
] were
adduced to determine the feasibility and viability of the proposed
rehabilitation plan.


Metrobank and PSBank, in an Omnibus
Motion, sought the dismissal of MPPIâs petition for not being legally
feasible.  The Hearing Panel denied the
Motion and directed the creation of a management committee.  It also ordered the suspension of all claims
not only against MPPI but against the Co spouses, as well.


Metrobank and PSBank on one hand,
and TR Mercantile on the other, took exception in separate petitions for
certiorari (SEC-EB No. 473 and 479, respectively) before the Commission 
En
Banc
, questioning the order for the creation of a management
committee.  The Commission 
En Banc
,
in a consolidated Order dated 18 March 1996, denied both petitions.
[3]


Unsatisfied with
the consolidated order, Metrobank and PS Bank filed with public respondent
Court of Appeals a petition for review, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 40285,
alleging therein that


9.  The SEC (En Banc) misconstrued and misapplied the rules on suspension of
payments.


9.01.
 
The SEC (En Banc) went beyond the scope of Sec. 6 (c) of P.D. 902-A
by expanding the effects of the suspension of all actions for claims against
MPPI 
to include personal obligations of the Co spouses
.


9.02.
 
The SEC (En Banc) misinterpreted the RCBC ruling (213 SCRA 830) to
mean that the mere filing of a Petition for suspension of payments extinguishes
-- and not merely postpones the enforcement of -- mortgage liens over specific
corporate properties.  In short, the
filing of the petition 
ipso facto
 transforms -- permanently -- secured
credits to unsecured credits.  


9.03.
 
More, the SEC (En Banc) refused to remove MPPI from the control of
management committee despite having received uncontroverted evidence that the
proposed rehabilitation plan is neither feasible nor viable.  As far as the SEC (En Banc) is concerned,
therefore, a management committee can continue to exist even if the proposed
rehabilitation has already been shown not to be feasible and viable.
[4]


On 12 July 1996,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision
[5]
 affirming the appealed order with
the modification that the petition of Spouses Alfonso and Elizabeth Co filed
before the SEC for the suspension of payments of obligations they incurred in
their personal capacity was ordered dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  In justifying its modification, the Court of
Appeals ruled that petitions for suspension of payments under Section 5(d) of
P.D. No. 902-A are limited to corporations, partnerships, or associations.
[6]
 It then concluded that the Co
spouses could not be allowed as co-petitioners in their personal capacity in
MPPIâs petition; hence, the SEC exceeded its jurisdiction when it included them
under a state of suspension of payments.


Metrobank and PS
Bank filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration and/or Clarification
[7]
 urging the Court of Appeals (1) to
declare that the SECâs order placing MPPI under a management committee did not
thereby permanently discharge Metrobank and PS Bankâs mortgage lien over MPPIâs
property, and (2) to set aside the SEC (
En Banc
) order insofar as it
refused to remove MPPI under the control of a management committee.


MPPI and the Co
spouses also filed a motion for the reconsideration of the decision insofar as
it dismissed the petition of the said spouses for suspension of payments.
[8]


In its
resolution
[9]
 of 8 November 1996, the Court of
Appeals denied both motions for reconsideration but granted the motion for
clarification by declaring that the appointment of a management committee did
not by itself extinguish the mortgage lien over MPPIâs property.


Dissatisfied
with the abovementioned decision, MPPI and the Co spouses filed the instant
petition.


Metrobank and PS
Bank also filed with us  a Petition for
Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which was
docketed as G.R. No. 127169.  However,
in the Resolution of 24 February 1997, we denied the said petition for failure
of the petitioners therein to submit a verified statement of the date of filing
of their motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals and to
sufficiently show any reversible error in the questioned judgment.
[10]


The only issue
in this petition is whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the
petition for suspension of payments insofar as Spouses Alfonso and Elizabeth Co
were personally concerned.


We resolve the
issue in the negative.  The Court of
Appeals was correct in concluding that the SEC lacked or exceeded its
jurisdiction when it included the Co spouses under a state of suspension of
payments together with MPPI.


Section 3 of
P.D. No. 902-A
[11]
 vests upon the SEC absolute
jurisdiction, supervision, and control over 
all corporations
,

partnerships
,
 or associations
 which are grantees of primary franchise
or license or permit issued by the government to operate in the
Philippines.  Section 5 thereof grants
the SEC original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases such as
petitions of corporations, partnerships, or associations for suspension of
payments.  As amended by P.D. No. 1758,
Section 5 reads in part as follows:


Sec. 5.  In addition to the regulatory and adjudicative functions of the
Securities and Exchange Commission over corporations, partnerships and other
forms of associations registered with it as expressly granted under existing
laws and decrees, it shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
decide cases involving:


. . .


d) Petitions of corporations,
partnerships or associations to be declared in the state of suspension of
payments in cases where the corporation, partnership or association possesses
sufficient property to cover all its debts but foresees the impossibility of
meeting them when they respectively fall due or in cases where the corporation,
partnership or association has no sufficient assets to cover its liabilities,
but is under the management of a Rehabilitation Receiver or Management
Committee created pursuant to this Decree.


It is axiomatic
that jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution or by law.
[12]
  It is indubitably clear from the aforequoted Section 5(d) that only 
corporations,
partnerships
,
 and associations
 â NOT private individuals â can file
with the SEC petitions to be declared in a state of suspension of
payments.  It logically follows that the
SEC does not have jurisdiction to entertain petitions for suspension of
payments filed by parties other than 
corporations, partnerships, or
associations.
  Thus, in 
Chung Ka
Bio v. Intermediate Appellate Court
,
[13]
 
we
explicitly ruled:
 


This section clearly does
not allow a mere individual to file the petition which is limited to
âcorporation, partnerships or associations.â Administrative agencies like the
SEC are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and, as such, can exercise only those
powers which are specifically granted to them by their enabling statutes.
[14]
 Consequently, where no authority is granted to hear
petitions of individuals for suspension of payments, such petitions are beyond
the competence of the SEC.  The analogy
offered by the respondent court is clearly inappropriate for while it is true
that the Sandiganbayan may assume jurisdiction over private individuals, it is
because its charter expressly allows this in specified cases.  No similar permission is found in PD 902-A.


The circumstance that Ching
is a co-signer in the corporationsâ promissory notes, collateral or guarantee
or security agreements, does not make him a proper party.  Jurisdiction over the subject matter must
exist as a matter of law and cannot be fixed by agreement of the parties,
acquired through, or waived, enlarged or diminished by, any act or omission;
neither can it be conferred by acquiescence of the tribunal.  Hence, Alfredo Ching, as a mere individual,
cannot be allowed as a co-petitioner in SEC Case No. 2250.


The petitioners
try to convince this Court that the claims against the Co spouses, the payments
of which they sought to have suspended through their petition before the SEC,
are not personal in nature because such claims were incurred by them in their
capacity as officers of MPPI and while acting for and in behalf of the said
corporation.


This contention
is belied by petitioners-spousesâ own representations in their petition for
suspension of payments wherein they alleged that they had executed the
suretyship agreements in question in their personal capacity and offered their
personal properties to secure the obligations of petitioner MPPI.  Thus:


7.
     
Petitioners Alfonso L. Co and Elizabeth Y.
Co, are the principal stockholders as well as the Chairman and President, and
Executive Vice-President and General Manager, respectively of petitioner
MPPI.  They have joined this petition as
co-petitioners with respect to the obligations of petitioner MPPI where they
executed joint and several suretyship agreements in their personal capacities
and/or have offered their personal properties to secure the same.
[15]


The
petitioners-spouses are now estopped from denying that they executed the
suretyship agreements in their personal capacity.  Moreover, as correctly pointed out by the private respondents,
âto subscribe to Co spousesâ theory that they had acted for and in behalf of
the corporation when they executed the suretyship agreements would result in an
absurd situation wherein the corporation (acting through its officers) would actually
be acting as surety of itself.â


Hence,
respondent Court of Appeals was correct in ordering the dismissal of the
petition for suspension of payments insofar as the Co spouses were concerned on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the SEC.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DENIED.  The challenged decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 40285 is AFFIRMED 
in toto
