THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 122857, March 27, 1998 ]


ROY NICOLAS, PETITIONER,
VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS (SIXTH DIVISION) AND BLESILO F.B. BUAN, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


The issue in this
petition is whether the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in its
decision
[1]
 dated August 16, 1995 overturning
the decision
[2]
 dated May 31, 1993 of the Regional
Trial Court of Pasig, Branch 165, by ordering the dismissal of petitionerâs
complaint against private respondent for lack of merit.


On February 19,
1987, petitioner Roy Nicolas and private respondent Blesito Buan entered into a
Portfolio Management Agreement,
[3]
 wherein the former was to manage
the stock transactions of the latter for a period of three months with an
automatic renewal clause.  However, upon
the initiative of the private respondent the agreement was terminated on August
19, 1987, and thereafter he requested for an accounting of all transactions
made by the petitioner.


Three weeks
after the termination of the agreement, petitioner demanded from the private
respondent the amount of 
P
68,263.67 representing his alleged management
fees covering the periods of June 30, July 31 and August 19, 1987 as provided
for in the Portfolio Management Agreement.  But the demands went unheeded, much to the chagrin of the petitioner.


Rebuffed,
petitioner filed a complaint
[4]
 for collection of sum of money
against the private respondent before the trial court.  In his answer,
[5]
 private respondent contended that
petitioner mismanaged his transactions resulting in losses, thus, he was not
entitled to any management fees.


After hearing,
the trial court rendered its decision in favor of plaintiff, herein petitioner,
thus:


âIn View Of All The
Foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff
as follows:


1.
     
The amount of 
P
68,263.67 for the management fees of
plaintiff.


2.
     
The amount of 
P
8,000.00 as and for attorneyâs fees and
expenses of litigation.


3.
     
Costs of suit.


SO ORDERED.â


Dismayed,
private respondent appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals.  Finding merit in his case, the appellate
court reversed the trial courtâs finding and ruled against the petitioner, to
wit:


âWHEREFORE, the appealed
decision should be, as it is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and as a
consequence thereof, appelleeâs complaint is hereby DISMISSED.  No costs.


SO ORDERED.â


Petitionerâs
motion for reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals on November 29,
1995.
[6]


Due to the
sudden reversal of events, petitioner is now before us assailing the Court of
Appealsâ ruling alleging that it misappreciated the evidence he presented
before the trial court.


In reversing the
trial courtâs decision, the Court of Appeals opined that:


âThe lower court simply made
a sweeping statement that the profits were generated by appelleeâs (Petitioner
herein) transactions, making appellant (Private respondent herein) liable for
the payment of the money demanded by appellee on the basis of self-serving
profit and loss statements submitted as evidence by appellee.  Other than these pieces of evidence, the
trial court offered no satisfactory reason why the sum demanded by appellee be
paid.â


We affirm the
ruling of the Court of Appeals.


Under the
Portfolio Management Agreement, it was agreed that private respondent would pay
the petitioner 20% of all realized profits every end of the month as his
management fees.  The exact wording of
the provision reads:


âx x x
                                 
x x x
                            
x x x


3.
     
For his services, the INVESTOR agrees to pay the PORTFOLIO
MANAGER 20% of all realized profits every end of the month.â


Evidently, the
key word in the provision is âprofits.â  Simply put, profit has been defined as âthe excess of return over
expenditure in a transaction or series of transactionsâ
[7]
 or the âseries of an amount
received over the amount paid for goods and services.â
[8]


To begin with,
petitioner has the burden to prove that the transaction realized gains or
profits to entitle him to said management fees, as provided in the
Agreement.  Accordingly, petitioner
submitted the profit and loss statements
[9]
 for the period of June 30, July 31
and August 19, 1987, showing a total profit of  
P
341,318.34, of which 20% would represent his management fees
amounting to 
P
68,263.70.

In according no
probative value to these documents, the Court of Appeals declared that:


âExhibits âCâ, âDâ and âEâ
likewise cannot be relied upon to prove that profits were indeed realized.  At most, these are self-serving evidence
which do not carry much weight.  There
is no question that the profit and loss statements are relevant to the issue at
hand.  But as to whether or not these
statements induce belief as to the existence or non-existence of profits
generated by appellee, call for a minute examination of these documents.  It should be emphasized that the fees being
collected by appellee does not only spring from the rendition of services 
per
se
.  The Portfolio Management
Agreement requires that service fees be based on the profits realized out of
the stock transactions of appellee in behalf of appellant.  The profit and loss statements presented do not
sufficiently prove the existence of such profits.


The mere
fact that evidence is admissible does not necessarily mean that it is also
credible (People 
vs
. Agripa, 208 SCRA 589).  The statements, covering the months of June, July and up to 19
August 1987, simply tabulate the number of shares acquired from each company, a
column for profit and the last column for loss.  The statements were not authenticated by an auditor, nor by the
person who caused the preparation of the same.â
[13]


The analysis of
the evidence made by the Court of Appeals deserves our concurrence.  A cursory reading of these purported profit
and loss statements immediately raises doubts as to the veracity of the entries
stated therein.


Admittedly, like
any services rendered or performed, stock brokers are entitled to commercial
fees or compensation pursuant to the Revised Securities Act Rule 19-13, which
reads:


âRSA Rule 19-13.  Charges for Services Performed.  


Charges by
brokers or dealers, if any, for service performed, including miscellaneous
services such as collection of monies due for principal, dividends, interests,
exchange or transfer of securities, appeals, safekeeping or custody of
securities, and other services, shall be reasonable and not unfairly
discriminatory between customers.â
[14]


Moreover, the
same law provides that any fee or commission must be with due regard to
relevant circumstances.
[15]


Unfortunately,
the profit and loss statements presented by the petitioner are nothing but bare
assertions, devoid of any concrete basis or specifics as to the method of
arriving at the amounts indicated in the documents.  In fact, it did not even state when the stocks were purchased, the
type of stocks (whether Class âAâ or âBâ or common or preferred) bought, when
the stocks were sold, the acquisition and selling price of each stock, when the
profits, if any, were delivered to the private respondent, the cost of
safekeeping or custody of the stocks, as well as the taxes paid for each
transaction.  With respect to the
alleged losses, it has been held that where a profit or loss statement shows a
loss, the statement must show income and items of expense to explain the method
of determining such loss.
[16]
 However, in the instant petition,
petitioner hardly elucidated the reasons and the factors behind the losses
incurred in the course of the transactions.


In short, no
evidentiary value can be attributed to the profit and loss statements submitted
by the petitioner.  These documents can
hardly be considered a credible or true reflection of the transactions.  It is an incomplete record yielding easily
to the inclusion or deletion of certain matters.  The contents are subject to suspicion since they are not
reflective of all pertinent and relevant data.  Thus, even assuming the admissibility of these alleged profit and loss
statements, they are devoid of any evidentiary weight, for the amounts are
conclusions without premises, its bases left to speculation, conjectures,
assertions and guesswork.


As regards
Exhibit âB,â
[17]
 we quote with approval the Court of
Appealsâ finding, thus:


âThere is no question that
appellant secured the services of appellee as portfolio manager, evidenced by
the Portfolio Management Agreement (Exh. A).  Pursuant to the Agreement, appellee entered into several transactions
from 19 February 1987 up to 19 August 1987 or a period of six months.  Thereafter, the agreement was not renewed by
appellant.  The ledger of accounts
(Exhibit âBâ) presented by appellee as proof of the transactions entered into
only shows the following data: (1) dates in which the stocks were acquired; (2)
classified the acquired stocks to be in long or short term trading; (3) the
price of each stock; (4) which companyâs stocks were acquired; and, (5) the
total amount paid for each stock.  It
does not show how much profit was realized from each transaction.â


In sum, we find
that petitioner has not proven the amounts indicated adequately.  His testimony explaining the bases for the
management fees demanded by him are nothing more than a self-serving exercise
which lacks probative value.  There were
no credible documentary evidence (e.g. receipts of the transactions, order
ticket, certificate of deposit; whether the stock certificates were deposited
in a bank or professional custodian, and others) to support his claim that
profits were indeed realized.  At best,
his assertions are founded on mere inferences and generalities.  There must be more convincing proof which in
this case is wanting.


To our mind, petitionerâs
complaint is similar to an action for damages, wherein the general rule is that
for the same to be recoverable it must not only be capable of proof but must
actually be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty, and courts, in making
the awards, must posit specific facts which could afford sufficient basis for
measuring compensatory or actual damages.
[18]
 Since petitioner could not present
any credible evidence to substantiate his claims, the Court of Appeals was
correct in ordering the dismissal of his complaint.


Lastly, the
futility of petitionerâs action became more pronounced by the fact that he
traded securities for the account of others without the necessary license from
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Clearly, such omission was in violation of Section 19 of the Revised
Securities Act which provides that no broker shall sell any securities unless
he is registered with the SEC.  The
purpose of the statute requiring the registration of brokers selling securities
and the filing of data regarding securities which they propose to sell, is to
protect the public and strengthen the securities mechanism.
[19]


American
jurisprudence emphasizes the principle that:


âx x x, an
unlicensed person may not recover compensation for services as a broker where a
statute or ordinance requiring a license is applicable and such statute or
ordinance is of a regulatory nature, was enacted in the exercise of the police
power for the purpose of protecting the public, requires a license as evidence
of qualification and fitness, and expressly precludes an unlicensed person from
recovering compensation by suit, or at least manifests an intent to prohibit
and render unlawful the transaction of business by an unlicensed person.â
[20]


We see no reason
not to apply the same rule in our jurisdiction.  Stock market trading, a technical and highly specialized
institution in the Philippines, must be entrusted to individuals with proven
integrity, competence and knowledge, who have due regard to the requirements of
the law.


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 16, 1995 as well as the
Resolution dated November 29, 1995 are hereby
 
AFFIRMED.  Costs against petitioner.
