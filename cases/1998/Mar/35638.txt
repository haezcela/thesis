NATIONAL FEDERATION OF LABOR
(NFL), PETITIONER, VS. THE SECRETARY OF LABOR OF THEÂ Â  REPUBLICÂ 
OFÂ Â Â  THE PHILIPPINES AND HIJO
PLANTATION INC. (HPI), RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O NÂ 




MENDOZA, J.:


Petitioner NFL
(National Federation of Labor) was chosen the bargaining agent of rank-and-file
employees of the Hijo Plantation Inc. (HPI) in Mandaum, Tagum, Davao del Norte
at a certification election held on August 20, 1989.  Protests filed by the company and three other unions against the
results of the election were denied by the Department of Labor and Employment
in its resolution dated February 14, 1991 but, on motion of the company (HPI),
the DOLE reconsidered its resolution and ordered another certification election
to be held.  The DOLE subsequently
denied petitioner NFLâs motion for reconsideration.  


The present
petition is for certiorari to set aside orders of the Secretary of Labor and
Employment dated August 29, 1991, December 26, 1991 and February 17, 1992,
ordering the holding of a new certification election to be conducted in place
of the one held on August 20, 1989 and, for this purpose, reversing its earlier
resolution dated February 14, 1991 dismissing the election protests of private
respondent and the unions.


The facts of the
case are as follows:


On November 12,
1988, a certification election was conducted among the rank-and-file employees
of the Hijo Plantation, Inc. resulting in the choice of  âno union.â  However, on July 3, 1989, on allegations that the company intervened in
the election, the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations nullified the
results of the certification election and ordered a new one to be held.


The new election
was held on August 20, 1989 under the supervision of the DOLE Regional Office
in Davao City with the following results: 


Total Votes cast
---------------------------  1,012

The Trust Union
Society and Trade Workers-KILUSAN (TRUST-Kilusan), the United Lumber and
General Workers of the Philippines (ULGWP), the Hijo Labor Union and the Hijo
Plantation, Inc. sought the nullification of the results of the certification
election on the ground that it was conducted despite the pendency of the
appeals filed by Hijo Labor Union and ULGWP from the order, dated August 17,
1989, of the Med-Arbiter denying their motion for intervention.  On the other hand, HPI claimed that it was
not informed or properly represented at the pre-election conference.  It alleged that, if it was represented at
all in the pre-election conference, its representative acted beyond his
authority and without its knowledge.  Private respondent also alleged that the certification election was
marred by massive fraud and irregularities and that out of 1,692 eligible
voters, 913, representing 54% of the rank-and-file workers of private
respondent, were not able to vote, resulting in a failure of election.


On January 10,
1990, Acting Labor Secretary Dionisio dela Serna directed the Med-Arbiter,
Phibun D. Pura, to investigate the companyâs claim that 54% of the
rank-and-file workers were not able to vote in the certification election.


In his Report
and Recommendation, dated February 9, 1990, Pura stated:  


1.  A majority of the rank-and-file workers had
been disfranchised in the election of August 20, 1989 because of confusion
caused by the announcement of the company that the election had been postponed
in view of the appeals of ULGWP and Hijo Labor Union (HLU) from the order
denying their motions for intervention.  In addition, the election was held on a Sunday which was a non-working
day in the company.


2.   There were irregularities committed in the
conduct of the election.  It was
possible that some people could have voted for those who did not show up.  The election was conducted in an open and
hot area.  The secrecy of the ballot had
been violated. Management representatives were not around to identify the
workers.


3. The total
number of votes cast, as duly certified by the representation officer, did not
tally with the 41-page listings submitted to the Med-Arbitration Unit.  The list contained 1,008 names which were
checked or encircled (indicating that they had voted) and 784 which were not,
(indicating that they did not vote), or a total of 1,792, but according to the
representation officer the total votes cast in the election was 1,012.


Med-Arbiter Pura
reported that he interviewed eleven employees who claimed that they were not
able to vote and who were surprised to know that their names had been checked
to indicate that they had voted.


But NFL wrote a
letter to Labor Secretary Ruben Torres complaining that it had not been
informed of the investigation conducted by Med-Arbiter Pura and so was not
heard on its evidence.  For this
reason, the Med-Arbiter was directed by the Labor Secretary to hear interested
parties.


The Med-Arbiter
therefore summoned the unions.  TRUST-Kilusan reiterated its petition for the annulment of the results
of the certification election.  Hijo
Labor Union manifested that it was joining private respondent HPIâs appeal,
adopting as its own the documentary evidence presented by the company, showing
fraud in the election of August 20, 1989.  On the other hand, petitioner NFL reiterated its contention that
management had no legal personality to file an appeal because it was not a
party to the election but was only a bystander which did not even extend
assistance in the election.  Petitioner
denied that private respondent HPI was not represented in the pre-election
conference, because the truth was that a certain Bartolo was present on behalf
of the management and he in fact furnished the DOLE copies of the list of
employees, and posted in the company premises notices of the certification
election.


Petitioner NFL
insisted that more than majority of the workers voted in the election.  It claimed that out of 1,692 qualified voters,
1,012 actually voted and only 680 failed to cast their vote. It charged
management with resorting to all kinds of manipulation to frustrate the
election and make the âNon Unionâ win.


In a resolution
dated February 14, 1991, the DOLE upheld the August 20, 1989 certification
election.  With respect to claim that
election could not be held in view of the pendency of the appeals of the ULGWP
and Hijo Labor Union from the order of the Med-Arbiter denying their motions
for intervention, the DOLE said:
[1]


  . . . even before the conduct of the certification election on 12
November 1988 which was nullified, Hijo Labor Union filed a motion for
interventions.  The same was however,
denied for being filed unseasonably, and as a result it was not included as one
of the choices in the said election.  After it has been so disqualified thru an order which has become final
and executory, ALU filed a second motion for intervention when a second
balloting was ordered conducted.  Clearly, said second motion is proforma and intended to delay the
proceedings.  Being so, its appeal from
the order of denial did not stay the election and the Med-Arbiter was correct
and did not violate any rule when he proceeded with the election even with the
appeal.  In fact, the Med-Arbiter need
not rule on the motion as it has already been disposed of with finality.


The same is true with the motion
for intervention of ULGWP. The latter withdrew as a party to the election on
September 1988 and its motion to withdraw was granted by the Med-Arbiter on
October 27, 1988.  After such
withdrawal, it cannot revive its lost personality as a party to the present
case through the mere expedience of a motion for intervention filed before the
conduct of a second balloting where the choices has already been pre-determined.


Let it be stressed that ULGWP and
HLU were disqualified to participate in the election through valid orders that
have become final and executory even before the first certification election
was conducted. Consequently, they may not be allowed to disrupt the proceeding
through the filing of nuisance motions.  Much less are they possessed of the legal standing to question the
results of the second election considering that they are not parties thereto.


The DOLE gave no
weight to the report of the Med-Arbiter that the certification election was
marred by massive fraud and irregularities.  Although affidavits were submitted showing that the election was held
outside the company premises and private vehicles were used as makeshift
precincts, the DOLE found that this was because respondent company did not
allow the use of its premises for the purpose of holding the election, company
guards were allegedly instructed not to allow parties, voters and DOLE
representation officers to enter the company premises, and notice was posted on
the door of the company that the election had been postponed.


Nor was weight
given to the findings of the Med-Arbiter that a majority of the rank-and-file
workers had been disfranchised in the August 20, 1989 election and that the
secrecy of the ballot had been violated, first, because the NFL was not given
notice of the investigation nor the chance to present its evidence to dispute
this finding and, second, the Med Arbiterâs report was not supported by the
minutes of the proceedings nor by any record of the interviews of the 315
workers.  Moreover, it was pointed out
that the report did not state the names of the persons investigated, the
questions asked and the answers given. The DOLE held that the report was
âtotally baseless.â  


The resolution
of February 14, 1991 concluded with a reiteration of the rule that the choice
of the exclusive bargaining representative is the sole concern of the workers.
It said: âIf indeed there were irregularities committed during the election,
the contending unions should have been the first to complain considering that
they are the ones which have interest that should be protected.â
[2]


Accordingly, the
Labor Secretary denied the petition to annul the election filed by the ULGWP,
TRUST-KILUSAN, HLU and the HPI and instead certified petitioner NFL as the sole
and exclusive bargaining representative of the rank-and-file employees of
private respondent HPI.


However, on
motion of HPI, the Secretary of Labor, on August 29, 1991, reversed his
resolution of February 14, 1991.  Petitioner NFL filed a motion for reconsideration but its motion was
denied in an order, dated December 26, 1991.  Petitionerâs second motion for reconsideration was likewise denied in
another order dated February 17, 1992.  Hence, this petition.


First
. Petitioner contends that
certification election is the sole concern of the employees and the employer is
a mere bystander. The only instance wherein the employer may actively
participate is when it files a petition for certification election under Art.
258 of the Labor Code because it is requested to bargain collectively.  Petitioner says that this is not the case
here and so the DOLE should not have given due course to private respondentâs
petition for annulment of the results of the certification election.


In his
resolution of August 29, 1991, the Secretary of Labor said he was reversing his
earlier resolution because âworkers of  Hijo Plantation, Inc. have deluged this Office with their letter-appeal,
either made singly or collectively expressing their wish to have a new
certification election conductedâ and that as a result âthe firm position we
held regarding the integrity of the electoral exercise had been somewhat eroded
by this recent declaration of the workers, now speaking in their sovereign
capacity.â  


It is clear from
this, that what the DOLE Secretary considered in reversing its earlier rulings
was not the petition of the employer but the letter-appeals that the employees
sent to his office denouncing the irregularities committed during the August
20, 1989 certification election.  The
petition of private respondent was simply the occasion for the employees to
voice their protests against the election.  Private respondent HPI attached to its Supplemental Appeal filed on
September 5, 1989 the affidavits and appeals of more or less 784 employees who
claimed that they had been disfranchised, as a result of which they were not
able to cast their votes at the August 20, 1989 election.  It was the protests of employees which moved
the DOLE to reconsider its previous resolution of February 14, 1991,  upholding the election.


Nor is it
improper for private respondent to show interest in the conduct of the
election.  Private respondent is the
employer.  The manner in which the
election was held could make the difference between industrial strife and
industrial harmony in the company.  What
an employer is prohibited from doing is to interfere with the conduct of the
certification election for the purpose of influencing its outcome.  But certainly an employer has an abiding
interest in seeing to it that the election is clean, peaceful, orderly and
credible.  


Second. 
The petitioner argues that any
protest concerning the election should be registered and entered into the
minutes of the election proceedings before it can be considered.  In addition,  the protest should be formalized by filing it within five (5)
days. Petitioner avers that these requirements are condition precedents in the
filing of an appeal. Without these requisites the appeal cannot prosper.  It cites the following provisions of Book V,
Rule VI of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code:


SECTION 3. 
Representation
officer may rule on any on-the-spot questions
. - The Representation officer
may rule on any on-the-spot question arising from the conduct of the
election.  The interested party may
however, file a protest with the representation officer before the close of the
proceedings.


Protests not so raised are deemed
waived.  Such protests shall be
contained in the minutes of the proceedings.


SEC. 4.  
Protest to be decided in twenty (20) working days
. - Where
the protest is formalized before the med-arbiter within five (5) days after the
close of the election proceedings, the med-arbiter shall decide the same within
twenty (20) working days from the date of its formalization.  If not formalized within the prescribed
period, the protest shall be deemed dropped.  The decision may be appealed to the Bureau in the same manner and on the
same grounds as provided under Rule V.


In this case,
petitioner maintains that private respondent did not make any protest regarding
the alleged irregularities (
e.g.,
 massive disfranchisement of employees)
during the election.  Hence, the appeal
and motions for reconsideration of private respondent HPI should have been
dismissed summarily.


The complaint in
this case was that a number of employees were not able to cast their votes
because they were not properly notified of the date.  They could not therefore have filed their protests within five
(5) days.  At all events, the Solicitor
General states, that the protests were not filed within five (5) days, is a
mere technicality which should not be allowed to  prevail over the workersâ welfare.
[3]
 As this Court stressed in 
LVN
Pictures, Inc. v. Phil.  Musicians
Guild,
[4]
 it is essential that the employees
must be accorded an opportunity to freely and intelligently determine which
labor organization shall act in their behalf.  The workers in this case were denied this opportunity.  Not only were a substantial number of them
disfranchised, there were, in addition, allegations of fraud and other
irregularities which put in question the integrity of the election.  Workers wrote letters and made complaints
protesting the conduct of the election.  The Report of Med-Arbiter Pura who investigated these allegations found
the allegations of fraud and irregularities to be true.  


In one case this
Court invalidated a certification election upon a showing of disfranchisement,
lack of secrecy in the voting and bribery.
[5]
 We hold the same in this case.  The workersâ right to self-organization as
enshrined in both the Constitution and Labor Code would be rendered nugatory if
their right to choose their collective bargaining representative were
denied.  Indeed, the policy of the Labor
Code favors the holding of a certification election as the most conclusive way
of choosing the labor organization to represent workers in a collective
bargaining unit.
[6]
 In case of doubt, the doubt should
be resolved in favor of the holding of a certification election. 


Third.  
Petitioner claims that the contending unions, namely,  the Association of Trade Union (ATU), the
Union of Filipino Workers (UFW), as well as the representation officers of the
DOLE affirmed the regularity of the conduct of the election and they are now
estopped from questioning the election.


In its comment,
ATU-TUCP states,  


. . . The representative of the
Association of Trade Unions really attest to the fact that we cannot really
identify all the voters who voted on that election except some workers who were
our supporters in the absence of Hijo Plantation representatives.  We also attest  that the polling precinct were not conducive to secrecy of the
voters since it was conducted outside of the Company premises.   The precincts were (sic) the election was
held were located in a passenger waiting shed infront of the canteen across the
road; on the yellow pick-up; at the back of a car; a waiting shed near the
Guard House and a waiting shed infront of the Guard House across the road.  Herein private respondents also observed
during the election that there were voters who dictated some voters the phrase
ânumber 3â to those who were casting their votes and those who were about to vote.  Number 3 refers to the National Federation
of Labor in the official ballot.
 


ATU-TUCP explains that it did not file any  protest because it expected workers who had been  aggrieved by the conduct of the election
would file their protest since it was in their interests that they do so. 


Fourth
.  Petitioner points out that the letter-appeals were written almost two
years after the election and they bear the same dates (May 7 and June 14,
1991);  they are not verified; they do
not contain details or evidence of intelligent acts;  and they do not explain why the writers failed to vote.  Petitioner contends that the letter-appeals
were obtained through duress by the company.  


We find the
allegations to be without merit.  The
record shows that as early as August 22 and 30, 1989, employees already wrote
letters/affidavits/manifestoes alleging irregularities in the elections and
disfranchisement of workers.
[7]
 As the Solicitor General says in
his Comment,
[8]
 these affidavits and manifestoes,
which were attached as Annexes âAâ to âCCâ and Annexes âDDâ to âDD-33â to
private respondentâs Supplemental Petition of September 5, 1989 Â¾ just 16 days
after the August 20, 1989 election.  It
is not true therefore that the employees slept on their rights.  


As to the claim
that letters dated May 7, 1991 and June 14, 1991 bear these same dates because
they were prepared by private respondent HPI and employees were merely asked to
sign them, suffice it to say that this is plain speculation which petitioner
has not proven by competent evidence. 


As to the
letters not being verified, suffice it to say that technical rules of evidence
are not binding in labor cases.  


The allegation
that the letters did not contain evidence of intelligent acts does not have
merit.  The earlier letters
[9]
 of the workers already gave details
of what they had witnessed during the election, namely the open balloting (with
no secrecy), and the use of NFL vehicles for polling precincts.  These letters sufficiently give an idea of
the irregularities of the certification election.   Similarly, the letters containing the signatures of those who were
not able to vote are sufficient.  They  indicate that the writers
were not able to vote because they thought the election had been postponed,
especially given the fact that the two unions had pending appeals at the time
from orders denying them the right to intervene in the election. 


WHEREFORE
, the petition for certiorari is
DISMISSED and the questioned orders of the Secretary of Labor and Employment
are AFFIRMED.
