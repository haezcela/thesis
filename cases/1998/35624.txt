LEON CO, PETITIONER, VS.
COURT OF APPEALS AND BENITO NGO, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


This is a
petition for review on 
certiorari
 of the Resolution of 18 August 1995 of
respondent Court of Appeals
[1]
 in
CA-G.R. CV No. 38012 reversing its previous Decision of 14 September 1994 which
affirmed the finding of the trial court that there was a contract of sale
between petitioner and private respondent.


On 3 September
1976 private respondent Benito Ngo purchased from  Nazario Gonzales a parcel of land  known as Lots Nos. 7-A and 7-B, Psd-05-000239, with an area of
155 square meters, which forms part of a bigger area covered by OCT No. RO-16
(1355) situated in Iriga City.  As
Benito Ngo had earlier acquired the  adjacent  portions  known  as  Lots 


Nos. 7-C, 7-D
and 7-E also from Gonzales, the entire Lot No. 7 was subsequently segregated
from OCT No. RO-16 (1355).  On 15
September 1976 TCT No. 91 was issued over Lot No. 7 in the name of private
respondent Benito Ngo.


On 3 November
1976  Antonio Ong, claiming to have
purchased Lots Nos. 7-A and 7-B from Nazario Gonzales through his attorney-in-fact
Rustica Gonzales Rivera, filed an action against Benito Ngo with the then Court
of First Instance of Camarines Sur for annulment of sale, reconveyance and
damages.


On 11 March 1979
the Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce of Naga City and of Iriga City held a
joint meeting to amicably settle certain controversies among their
members.  However, only the dispute
between Antonio Ong and Benito Ngo was taken up in that meeting.  A consensus was reached that the litigated
area should be divided between Ong and respondent Ngo so that Lot No. 7-A would
go  to Ong and Lot No. 7-B to Ngo.  Antonio Ong was not satisfied with the
proposal as he claimed to have bought the whole property for  
P
60,000.00.  To appease Ong, his uncle Jorge Ong agreed to give him 
P
30,000.00
to compensate for half of the purchase price he had paid for the property.  With regard to Lot No. 7-B, which was leased
by a certain Ong To, the Chambers jointly issued a resolution to the effect
that Ong To should give up his occupancy for a compensation of 
P
40,000.00;  that Buenaventura and Melecio Ngo, brothers
of Benito Ngo, should each give Ong To 
P
15,000.00, while petitioner Leon
Co,  brother-in-law of Benito Ngo, would
pay  
P
10,000.00 to Ong To who
would vacate Lot No. 7-B and deliver it to Benito Ngo.


Thereafter, on
23 April 1979 Antonio Ong and Benito Ngo assisted by their respective counsel
executed an amicable settlement which provided that  Lot No. 7-A would belong to Antonio Ong and Lot No. 7-B to Benito
Ngo.  The amicable settlement was
submitted to the trial court for approval.  However, before the same could be approved, a complaint-in-intervention
was filed by petitioner Leon Co alleging that in the joint conference between
the Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Naga City and the Filipino-Chinese
Chamber of Commerce of Iriga City it was agreed that Lot No. 7-B would go to
him after paying respondent Benito Ngo 
P
49,500.00 for the lot.  Respondent Ngo vehemently denied having
entered into such agreement, much less having received any amount therefor.


On the basis of
the memorandum and affidavits submitted by petitioner Leon Co, over the
objection of respondent Benito Ngo, the trial court rendered a decision
ordering Benito Ngo to reconvey Lot No. 7-B to Leon Co, plus damages.


On appeal, the
Intermediate Appellate Court
 
declared the decision of the trial
court null and void for being violative of procedural due process and remanded
the case to the lower court for trial on the merits.


After the remand
of the case to the court 
a quo
, respondent Benito Ngo sought inhibition
of Judge Ulysses Salvador of the Regional Trial Court of Iriga City alleging
bias in favor of petitioner Leon Co.  The motion to inhibit was denied by the presiding judge  who eventually, after a protracted trial, sustained
the claim  of  Leon Co that Benito Ngo had verbally sold to him Lot No. 7-B
sometime in August 1976 for 
P
49,500.00  thus - 


  x x x  judgment is hereby
rendered declaring the intervenor, Leon Co, the true and lawful owner of Lot
7-B which is the eastern half of the land described in the Deed of Sale
(Exhibit 9) now covered by TCT No. 91 in the name of Benito Ngo (Exhibit 11)
ordering defendant Benito Ngo to execute the appropriate Deed of Sale of said
property in favor of Leon Co and to vacate the same and peacefully deliver the
possession thereof to Leon Co, and further ordering defendant to pay Leon Co
the following sums: (a) 
P
1,000,000.00 for moral damages; (b) 
P
50,000.00
for attorney's fees; (c) 
P
1,000.00 a month by way of rental for the use
of the land from June 15, 1979 until the same is actually delivered to the
intervenor; and, (d) costs.


On appeal by
respondent Ngo, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision modifying the
judgment of the Regional Trial Court by reducing the moral damages from 
P
1,000,000.00
to 
P
100,000.00 and affirming the rest of the decision 
in toto
.


Upon motion for
reconsideration by respondent Ngo, the Court of Appeals  reversed itself by ordering the dismissal of
the complaint-in-intervention of petitioner. 


Petitioner moved
to reconsider the above resolution but his motion was denied.  Hence, this petition alleging that the
Court of Appeals erred:  (a) in
reversing its prior decision of 14 September 1994 and concluding that there was
bias on the part of the trial court in the assessment of the evidence; (b) in
ignoring the glaring inconsistencies in the testimony of respondent Ngo; and,
(c) in declaring that there was no evidence of sale of the subject property
between petitioner and private respondent.
[2]


Petitioner
argues that respondent appellate court deviated from its duty by intruding into
the province of the trial court which is in a much better position to assess
the credibility of witnesses.  Petitioner contends that the appellate court failed to appreciate the
credible testimonies of his witnesses which jibe with the documentary evidence
showing that a contract of sale existed between the parties.  Petitioner also faults the appellate court
for not considering the glaring inconsistencies and contradictions in the pleadings
and testimony of private respondent Ngo who failed to overcome the evidence
presented by petitioner that there was an agreement to sell  the property.  


We cannot
sustain petitioner.  The rule that the
factual findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and respect on
appeal is neither absolute nor inflexible.  One of the exceptions to the rule is where substantial facts and
circumstances have been overlooked which, if properly considered, would justify
a different conclusion or alter the result of the case.


Notwithstanding
the affirmance by respondent appellate court in its earlier decision of the
factual findings of the trial court, it reversed itself after a reexamination
of the record independent of the assessment of the evidence by the trial
court.  Respondent court ruled that
certain facts have been overlooked resulting in a misappreciation of the
documentary and testimonial evidence.
[3]


In claiming that
respondent Ngo sold the property to petitioner, the latter alleged in his complaint-in-intervention
-  


5.  With the combined efforts of all the above-mentioned parties, an
amicable settlement was finally reached by the litigants under the following
terms and conditions:


(a)  The land
in question between Antonio Ong and Benito Ngo in Civil Case No. IR 545 shall
be divided into two (2) equal parts; one-half thereof to be given to plaintiff
Antonio Ong and the other half to defendant Benito Ngo.


(b)  The
portion adjudicated to Benito Ngo shall be given by the latter to intervenor Leon
Co who had already paid the amount of 
P
49,500.00.  This arrangement was made in order that said
Leon Co shall have a lot wherein to run his business in lieu of the parcel of
land he is presently occupying as lessee which is the subject matter of the litigation
in Civil Case No. IR-317 between him and Segundina Nacario;


(c)  Leon Co,
in turn, shall deliver to Segundina Nacario the said parcel of land he now
occupies as lessee thereof first from the original owner, Nazario Gonzales and
lastly from Rustica Gonzales who inherited the said property from Nazario
Gonzales;

Nothing in the
above document speaks of any agreement between petitioner and private
respondent wherein petitioner shall buy the property and private respondent to
sell the same to petitioner.  What
transpired during the  meeting,  as  indicated  in  the  Minutes,  was that the relatives
of Antonio Ong and respondent Benito Ngo agreed to participate  in  the amicable settlement by contributing their own funds for the
purpose.  The appellate court was
correct in ruling that  the  document  clearly  negated  the  existence  of  petitionerâs  cause.  In fact, records
show that petitioner on cross-examination admitted that neither such agreement
of sale nor facts from which such agreement could be inferred were actually set
forth in the Minutes of the said meeting.
[4]


In the absence
of any other document showing the alleged sale, petitioner tried to prove his
claim through testimonial evidence.  The
appellate court however found several inconsistencies and contradictions in the
testimonies of petitionerâs witnesses in connection with the identity  of the land claimed by petitioner and the
circumstances surrounding the alleged sale and payment of the purchase price.  Petitioner and his wife Ester Co testified
that respondent Ngo had offered to sell to them Lot No. 7-B in August or about
two (2) weeks before 6 September 1976.  On the other hand, Antonio Ong stated that respondent Ngo bought Lot No.
7-A which should pertain to Leon Co and Lot No. 7-B to Ong To.  Buenaventura Ngo, another witness presented
by petitioner, narrated a different version of the transaction and asserted
that  the subject property was actually
purchased by petitioner but in the name of respondent Benito Ngo.
[5]


Petitioner
claimed to have made the following payments to respondent Ngo of the  purchase  price  of  the  property  amounting  to 
P
49,500.00, to wit:  (a) 
P
20,000.00 in cash in 1976; (b) 
P
10,000.00
by Feati Bank and Trust Company (FBTC) Check No. 033180 dated 5 April 1979
payable to respondent  Benito  Ngo;  (c) 
P
10,000.00  by  FBTC  Check  No. 003181  dated  15  May 1979; and, (d) 
P
9,500.00
by FBTC Check No. 033182 dated 15 June 1979 payable to respondent Benito  Ngo.  While  alleging that respondent
Ngo encashed the check dated 15 April 1979 for 
P
10,000.00, petitioner
affirmed that respondent Ngo returned the two (2) other checks amounting to 
P
10,000.00
and 
P
9,500.00 which were refused acceptance by petitioner, hence,
respondent Ngo crossed out the checks which destroyed their efficacy.
[6]
 
Thereafter,
petitioner withdrew the amounts covered by the two (2) checks which were
destroyed by respondent Ngo
[7]
 
thereby
resulting in actual payment of only 
P
20,000.00 in favor of respondent
Ngo as of 11 March 1979.  These
admissions contradict petitionerâs own statement that his payment of 
P
49,500.00
caused the execution of the agreement on 11 March 1979 during the arbitration
meeting of the Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce.  Against the claim of petitioner, respondent Ngo contends that the
payment by petitioner in his favor was not for the purchase  price  of  the  property but for another purpose, i.e., for the liquidation of
their 1978 accounts.


In fine, the
evidence of petitioner does not indicate a perfection of the purported contract
of sale which, under Art. 1458 of the Civil Code, is a contract by which
"one of the contracting parties obligates himself to transfer the
ownership and to deliver a determinate thing, and  the  other  to  pay    therefor  a  price  certain  in  money  or  its equivalent."  Under Art. 1475 of the Code, "the
contract of sale is perfected at the moment there is meeting of the minds upon
the thing which  is  the  object  of  the  contract  and  upon  the  price.  From that moment the parties may
reciprocally demand performance subject to the provisions of the law governing
the form of contracts."


A definite
agreement on the manner of payment of the price is an essential element in the
formation of a binding and enforceable contract of sale.
[8]
 
Petitionerâs
testimonial and documentary evidence did not establish any definitive agreement
or meeting of the minds between the parties concerning the price or term of
payment.  The contention of petitioner
that the agreement of sale between him and private respondent was forged during
the arbitration meeting of 11 March 1979 is contradicted by the Minutes of such
meeting.  Based thereon, there was
nothing whatsoever that transpired to indicate that the sale occurred between
the parties.  The admission of
petitioner himself that when he issued the checks amounting to 
P
19,500.00
in favor of respondent Benito Ngo,
 
supposedly as partial payment of
the purchase price, the latter destroyed the checks, thereby negating the existence
of  the meeting of the minds of the
parties on the sale.  The non-encashment
of the checks by respondent Ngo is indicative more of his non-acceptance of the
offer of petitioner to buy  the
property.  There was also no showing
that petitioner complied with the terms and conditions of the alleged sale,
including the payment of the alleged complete purchase price of 
P
49,500.00
for the property.


WHEREFORE
, the Petition is 
DENIED
, and
the Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 18 August 1995 reversing itself as
well as the Decision of the trial court, and dismissing the
Complaint-in-Intervention of petitioner, is  
AFFIRMED.  
Costs against
petitioner.
