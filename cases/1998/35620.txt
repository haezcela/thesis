BARONS MARKETING CORP., PETITIONER,
VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND PHELPS DODGE PHILS., INC. RESPONDENTS. 

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:


The instant
petition raises two issues:  (1) whether
or not private respondent is guilty of abuse of right; and (2) whether or not
private respondent is entitled to interest and attorneyâs fees.


The facts are
undisputed:


On August 31, 1973, plaintiff
[Phelps Dodge, Philippines, Inc. private respondent herein] appointed defendant
[petitioner Barons Marketing, Corporation] as one of its dealers of electrical wires
and cables effective September 1, 1973 (Exh. A).  As such dealer, defendant was given by plaintiff 60 days credit
for its purchases of plaintiffâs electrical products.  This credit term was to be reckoned from the date of delivery by
plaintiff of its products to defendant (Exh. 1).


During
the period covering December 1986 to August 17, 1987, defendant purchased, on
credit, from plaintiff various electrical wires and cables in the total amount
of 
P
4,102,438.30 (Exh. B to K).  These wires and cables were in turn sold, pursuant to previous
arrangements, by defendant to MERALCO, the former being the accredited supplier
of the electrical requirements of the latter.  Under the sales invoices issued by plaintiff to defendant for the
subject purchases, it is stipulated that interest at 12% on the amount due for
attorneyâs fees and collection (Exh. BB).
[1]
 On September 7, 1987,
defendant paid plaintiff the amount of 
P
300,000.00 out of its total
purchases as above-stated (Exh. S), thereby leaving an unpaid account on the
aforesaid deliveries of 
P
3,802,478.20.  On several occasions, plaintiff wrote defendant demanding payment of its
outstanding obligations due plaintiff (Exhs. L, M, N, and P).  In response, defendant wrote plaintiff on
October 5, 1987 requesting the latter if it could pay its outstanding account
in monthly installments of 
P
500,000.00 plus 1% interest per month
commencing on October 15, 1987 until full payment (Exh. O and O-4).  Plaintiff, however, rejected defendantâs
offer and accordingly reiterated its demand for the full payment of defendantâs
account (Exh. P).
[2]


On 29 October
1987, private respondent Phelps Dodge Phils., Inc. filed a complaint before the
Pasig Regional Trial Court against petitioner Barons Marketing Corporation for
the recovery of P3,802,478.20 representing the value of the wires and cables
the former had delivered to the latter, including interest.  Phelps Dodge likewise prayed that it be
awarded attorneyâs fees at the rate of 25% of the amount demanded, exemplary
damages amounting to at least 
P
100,000.00,  the expenses of litigation and the costs of suit.  


Petitioner, in
its answer, admitted purchasing the wires and cables from private respondent
but disputed the amount claimed by the latter.  Petitioner likewise interposed a counterclaim against private
respondent, alleging that it suffered injury to its reputation due to Phelps
Dodgeâs acts.  Such acts were
purportedly calculated to humiliate petitioner and constituted an abuse of rights.


After hearing,
the trial court on 17 June 1991 rendered its decision, the dispositive portion
of which reads:


WHEREFORE, from all the foregoing
considerations, the Court finds Phelps Dodge Phils., Inc. to have
preponderantly proven its case and hereby orders Barons Marketing, Inc. to pay
Phelps Dodge the following:


1. 
P
3,108,000.00
constituting the unpaid balance of defendantâs purchases from plaintiff and
interest thereon at 12% per annum computed from the respective expiration of
the 60 day credit term, vis-Ã -vis the various sales invoices and/or delivery
receipts;


2.  25% of the preceding obligation for and as attorneyâs fees;


3.  
P
10,000.00 as exemplary damages;


4. Costs
of suit.
[3]


Both parties
appealed to respondent court.  Private
respondent claimed that the trial court should have awarded it the sum of
P3,802,478.20,  the amount which
appeared in the body of the complaint and proven during the trial rather than
P3,108,000.00.  The latter amount
appears in petitionerâs prayer supposedly  as a result of a typographical error.


On the other
hand, petitioner reiterated its claims for damages as a result of  âcreditorâs abuse.â  It also alleged that private respondent
failed to prove its cause of action against it. 


On 25 June 1996,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision modifying the decision of the trial
court, thus:


WHEREFORE, from all the foregoing
considerations, the Court finds Phelps Dodge Phils., Inc. to have
preponderantly proven its case and hereby orders Barons Marketing, Inc. to pay
Phelps Dodge the following:


1.  
P
3,802,478.20
 constituting the unpaid balance of
defendantâs purchases from plaintiff and interest thereon at 12% per annum
computed from the respective expiration of the 60 day credit term, vis-Ã -vis
the various sales invoices and/or delivery receipts; and


2. 5%  of the preceding obligation for and as attorneyâs fees. 


No costs.
[4]


Petitioner
Barons Marketing is now before this Court alleging that respondent  court erred when it held (1) private
respondent Phelps Dodge not guilty of âcreditorâs abuse,â and (2) petitioner liable
to private respondent for interest and attorneyâs fees.  


I


Petitioner does
not deny private respondentâs rights to institute an action for collection and
to claim full payment.  Indeed,
petitionerâs right to file an action for collection is beyond cavil.
[5]
 Likewise, private respondentâs
right to reject petitionerâs offer to pay in installments is guaranteed by
Article 1248 of the Civil Code which states: 


ART. 1248.  Unless there is an express stipulation to
that effect, 
the creditor cannot be compelled partially to receive the
prestations in which the obligation consists
.  Neither may the debtor be required to make partial payments.


However, when the debt is in part
liquidated and in part unliquidated, the creditor may demand and the debtor may
effect the payment of the former without waiting for the liquidation of the
latter.


Under this provision, the prestation , i.e., the object of the
obligation, must be performed in one act, not in parts.  


Tolentino
concedes that the right has its limitations:


Partial
Prestations. 
â
Since the creditor cannot be compelled to accept partial performance, unless
otherwise stipulated, the creditor who refuses to accept partial prestations
does not incur in delay or 
mora accipiendi
, 
except when there is abuse
of right or if good faith requires acceptance
.
[6]


Indeed, the law, as set forth in Article 19 of the Civil Code,
prescribes a âprimordial limitation on all rightsâ by setting certain standards
that must be observed in the exercise thereof
 
.
[7]
 Thus:


ART. 19.  Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the
performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe
honesty and good faith. 


Petitioner now
invokes Article 19 and Article 21
[8]
 of the Civil Code, claiming that private
respondent abused its rights when it rejected petitionerâs offer of settlement
and subsequently filed the action for collection considering:


xxx  that the relationship between the parties started
in 1973 spanning more than 13 years before the complaint was filed, that the
petitioner had been a good and reliable dealer enjoying a good credit standing
during the period before it became delinquent in 1987, that the relationship
between the parties had been a fruitful one especially for the private
respondent, that the petitioner exerted its outmost efforts to settle its
obligations and avoid a suit, that the petitioner did not evade in the payment
of its obligation to the private respondent, and that the petitioner was just
asking a small concession that it be allowed to liquidate its obligation to
eight (8) monthly installments of 
P
500,000.00 plus 1% interest per month
on the balance which proposal was supported by post-dated checks.
[9]


Expounding on
its theory, petitioner states:


In the ordinary course of events, a
suit for collection of a sum of money filed in court is done for the primary
purpose of collecting a debt or obligation.  If there is an offer by the debtor to pay its debt or obligation
supported by post-dated checks and with provision for interests, the normal
response of a creditor would be to accept the offer of compromise and not file
the suit for collection.  It is of
common knowledge that proceedings in our courts would normally take years
before an action is finally settled.  It is always wiser and more prudent to accept an offer of payment in
installment rather than file an action in court to compel the debtor to settle
his obligation in full in a single payment.


xxx.


xxx.  Why then did private respondent elect to
file a suit for collection rather than accept petitionerâs offer of settlement,
supported by post-dated checks, by paying monthly installments of P500,000.00
plus 1% per month commencing on October 15, 1987 until full payment?  The answer is obvious.  The action of private respondent in filling
a suit for collection was an abuse of right and exercised for the sole purpose
of prejudicing and injuring the petitioner.
[10]


Petitioner prays
that the Court order private respondent to pay petitioner moral and exemplary
damages, attorneyâs fees, as well as the costs of suit.  It likewise asks that it be allowed to
liquidate its obligation to private respondent, without interests, in eight equal
monthly installments.


Petitionerâs theory
is untenable.  


Both parties
agree that to constitute an abuse of rights under Article 19 the defendant must
act with bad faith or intent to prejudice the plaintiff.  They cite the following comments of
Tolentino as their authority:


Test
of Abuse of Right.  
â Modern jurisprudence does
not permit acts which, although not unlawful, are anti-social.  
There is undoubtedly an abuse of right
when it is exercised for the only purpose of prejudicing or injuring another
.  When the objective of the actor is illegitimate,
the illicit act cannot be concealed under the guise of exercising a right.  The principle does not permit acts which,
without utility or legitimate purpose cause damage to another, because they
violate the concept of social solidarity which considers law as rational and
just.  Hence, every abnormal exercise of
a right, contrary to its socio-economic purpose, is an abuse that will give
rise to liability.  
The exercise of a
right must be in accordance with the purpose for which it was established, and
must not be excessive or unduly harsh; there must be no intention to injure
another
.  Ultimately, however, and
in practice, courts, in the sound exercise of their discretion, will have to
determine all the facts and circumstances when the exercise of a right is
unjust, or when there has been an abuse of right.
[11]


The question,
therefore, is whether private respondent intended to prejudice or injure
petitioner when it rejected petitionerâs offer and filed the action for
collection.  


We hold in the
negative.  It is an elementary rule in
this jurisdiction that good faith is presumed and that the burden of proving
bad faith rests upon the party alleging the same.
[12]
 In the case at bar, petitioner has
failed to prove bad faith on the part of private respondent.  Petitionerâs allegation that private
respondent was motivated by a desire to terminate its agency relationship with
petitioner so that private respondent itself may deal directly with Meralco is
simply not  supported by the
evidence.  At most, such supposition is
merely speculative. 


Moreover, we
find that private respondent was driven by very legitimate  reasons  for  rejecting petitionerâs offer
and instituting the action for collection before the trial court.  As pointed out by private respondent, the
corporation had its own âcash position to protect in order for it to pay its
own obligations.â  This is not such âa
lame and poor rationalizationâ as petitioner purports it to be.  For if private respondent were to be
required to accept petitionerâs offer, there would be no reason for the latter
to reject similar offers from its other debtors.  Clearly, this would be inimical to the interests of any
enterprise, especially a profit-oriented one like private respondent.  It is plain to see that what we have here is
a mere 
exercise
 of rights, not an 
abuse 
thereof.  Under these circumstances, we do not deem
private respondent to have acted in a manner contrary to morals, good customs
or public policy as to violate the provisions of  Article 21 of the Civil Code.


Consequently,
petitionerâs prayer for moral and exemplary damages must thus be rejected.  Petitionerâs claim for moral damages is
anchored on Article 2219 (10) of the Civil Code which states:


ART. 2219.  Moral damages may be recovered in the
following and analogous cases:


xxx.


(10)  Acts and actions referred to in articles 
21
, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 32, 34, and 35.


xxx.


Having ruled that private respondentâs acts did not transgress the
provisions of Article 21, petitioner cannot be entitled to moral damages or,
for that matter, exemplary damages.  While the amount of exemplary damages need not be proved, petitioner
must show that he is entitled to 
moral
, temperate or compensatory
damages before the court may consider the question of whether or not  exemplary damages should be awarded.
[13]
 As we have observed above,
petitioner has failed to discharge this burden.  


It may not be
amiss to state that petitionerâs contract with private respondent has the force
of law between them.
[14]
 Petitioner is thus bound to fulfill
what has been expressly stipulated therein.
[15]
 In the absence of any abuse of
right, private respondent cannot be allowed to perform its obligation under
such contract in parts.  Otherwise,
private respondentâs right under Article 1248 will be negated, the sanctity of
its contract with petitioner defiled.  The principle of autonomy of contracts
[16]
 must be respected. 


II


Under said
contract, petitioner is liable to private respondent for the unpaid balance of
its purchases from private respondent 
plus 12% interest
.  Private respondentâs sales invoices
expressly provide that:


xxx. 
Interest
at 12% per annum will be charged on all overdue account
 plus 25% on said
amount for attorneyâs fees and collection.  xxx.
[17]


It may also be
noted that the above stipulation, insofar as it provides for the payment of
â25% on said amount for attorneyâs fees and collection (
sic
),â
constitutes what is known as a penal clause.
[18]
 Petitioner is thus obliged to pay
such penalty 
in addition
 to the 12% annual interest, there being an
express stipulation to that effect. 


Petitioner
nevertheless urges this Court to reduce the attorneyâs fees for being âgrossly
excessive,â  âconsidering the nature of
the case which is a mere action for collection of a sum of money.â  It may be pointed out however that the above
penalty is supposed to answer not only for attorneyâs fees but for collection
fees as well.  Moreover:


x x x the
attorneysâ fees here provided is not, strictly speaking, the attorneysâ fees
recoverable as between attorney and client spoken of and regulated by the Rules
of Court.  Rather, the attorneysâ fees
here are in the nature of liquidated damages and the stipulation therefor is
aptly called a penal clause.  It has
been said that so long as such stipulation does not contravene law, morals, or
public order, it is strictly binding upon defendant.  The attorneysâ fees so provided are awarded in favor of the
litigant, not his counsel.  It is the
litigant, not counsel, who is the judgment creditor entitled to enforce the
judgment by execution.
[19]


Nonetheless,
courts are empowered to reduce such penalty if the same is âiniquitous or
unconscionable.â  Article 1229 of the
Civil Code states thus: 


ART. 1229.  The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty
when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with by
the debtor.  
Even if there has been
no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is
iniquitous or unconscionable
. (Underscoring supplied.)


The sentiments
of the law are echoed in Article 2227 of the same Code:


ART. 2227.  Liquidated damages, whether intended as an
indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably reduced if they are iniquitous or
unconscionable.


It is true that
we have upheld the reasonableness of penalties in the form of attorneyâs fees
consisting of twenty-five percent (25%) of the principal debt plus interest.
[20]
 In the case at bar, however, the
interest alone runs to some four and a half million pesos (P4.5M), even
exceeding the principal debt amounting to almost four million pesos
(P4.0M).  Twenty five percent (25%) of
the principal and interest amounts to roughly two million pesos (P2M).  In real terms, therefore, the attorneyâs
fees and collection fees are manifestly exorbitant.  Accordingly, we reduce the same to ten percent (10%) of the 
principal
.


Private
respondent, however, argues that petitioner failed to question the award of
attorneyâs fees on appeal before respondent court and raised the issue only in
its motion for reconsideration.  Consequently, petitioner should be deemed to have waived its right to
question such award. 


Private
respondentâs attempts to dissuade us from reducing the penalty are futile.  The Court is clothed with ample authority
to review matters, even if they are not assigned as errors in their appeal, if
it finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just decision
of the case.
[21]


WHEREFORE, 
the decision of the Court of Appeals
is hereby MODIFIED in that the attorneyâs and collection fees are reduced
to  ten percent (10%) of the principal
but is AFFIRMED in all other respects.
