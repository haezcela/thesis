PUNO, J.:


On June 19,
1991, LORENZO ASIS y GONZALES alias Allan, ROMEO MENDOZA y SANTOS alias Romy,
ATANACIO CARINO y CRUZ alias Taning, and EMELITA MENDOZA alias Emy were charged
with MURDER before Branch 12 of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos,
Bulacan.  The four accused pleaded not
guilty to the following information
[1]
:


"That  on  or  about the 4th day of June
1991, in the Municipality of San Rafael, Province of Bulacan, Philippines and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, armed
with fan knives and with intent to kill one Ernesto Maningas y Sarengo,
conspiring, confederating together  and
mutually helping one another, with evident premeditation, treachery and abuse
of superior strength did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
attack, assault and stab with the same fan knives, the said Ernesto Maningas y
Sarengo, hitting the latter on the different parts of his body, thereby
inflicting on the latter serious physical injuries which directly caused his
death.


CONTRARY TO LAW."


Emelita Mendoza
was later excluded from the charge when no probable cause was found to exist
against her.
[2]
 Trial proceeded against the three
remaining accused. 


The prosecution
established that at about 8:00 p.m. on June 4, 1991, Ernesto Maningas went to
ply his usual trade as a tricycle driver.  The next morning, his dead body with twenty three (23) stab wounds was
found in Bgy. Pinakpinakan, San Rafael, Bulacan, near an irrigation dike. A
kitchen knife, with a detached handle was found 1 1/2 meters away from his
body.  A  blood-stained bamboo, about two meters long with a five-inch
nail  attached to its end was also found
2 1/2 meters away from his body.  Carlito Villanca, the barangay captain of Pinakpinakan, reported the incident
to the San Rafael Police Headquarters.  The victim's body was brought to the Municipal Hall where the Municipal
Health Officer found the cause of death as hemorrhage due to multiple stab
wounds.
[3]


On the morning
of June 7, 1991, Pat. Asher Villegas, Cpl. Romeo Galvez and Pfc. Eddie Urbano
of the San Rafael Police Headquarters and some members of the Citizen Armed
Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) picked up accused Lorenzo Asis from his
residence.  He fitted the description of
one of two men who arrived at the farmhouse of Rolando dela Cruz in Bgy.
Caingin, San Rafael, Bulacan, wearing blood-stained clothes.
[4]
 Witness Dela Cruz declared that at
9:30 in the morning of June 5, 1991, Rolando Mendoza, a resident of Bgy.
Caingin with an unidentified companion came at his house and asked for food.
[5]
 He noticed that Mendoza had a wound
on his left arm while his companion had a swollen right hand and bite marks on
the left shoulder.  When he inquired
what happened to them, Mendoza said they figured in a fight in Barangay
Pinakpinakan the night before.  The two
left after eating and while walking by the road were spotted by CAFGU
soldiers.  The soldiers went after the
two but failed to apprehend them. 


On the night of
June 7, 1991, Dela Cruz went to the police station and identified Asis as
Mendoza's companion.
[6]


On June 8, 1991,
accused Asis executed a written statement before Pat. Villegas where he
declared that he and Mendoza were hired by Atanacio Carino to kill Maningas
for  the sum of 
P
3,000.00.  He identified the broken knife found at the
scene of the crime as the weapon used by Mendoza in killing the victim.
[7]
 Carino was arrested but Mendoza was
able to flee after learning that policemen were looking for him.  He was eventually captured on July 5, 1991
in Dingalan, Aurora, Province.
[8]


Prosecution witness,
Gilbert de Guzman, a tricycle driver, declared that he last saw the victim
alive on June 4, 1991 at the tricycle station near his house in Barangay
Sampaloc, some twelve (12) kilometers away from Barangay Pinakpinakan.  On that day, at about 8:30 p.m., he saw the
victim drive his tricycle towards Bgy. Pinakpinakan with  accused Asis and Mendoza on board.  He was with Kristina, his sister-in-law,
waiting for a ride home.  When they saw
the victim, Kristina motioned for him to stop.  The victim slowed down and promised to pick up Kristina later.  The victim failed to return.
[9]


Consorcia
Maningas, the victim's widow, testified on the motive for the killing.  She declared that her mother is the
plaintiff in a case before the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board
(DARAB) for the recovery of a piece of land in the  possession of Barangay Captain Carlito Villanca.
[10]
 She averred that before her husband
was killed he had a heated argument with Villanca.  At the time of the victim's death, accused Carino was the one
cultivating the disputed land.  


  Accused Asis and Mendoza denied killing the
victim and offered an alibi.  They
alleged that on June 4, 1991, after buying something from the Baliwag Public
Market, they headed home at about 7:30 p.m.  They reached Mendoza's house at about 8:30 p.m.  


Tricycle driver
Mario Bernardino buttressed their alibi.  He testified that on June 4, 1991,  the two accused rode on his tricycle. He deposited them in front of
Mendoza's house at about 8:30 in the evening.  He also declared that before the two accused got inside his tricycle, he
noticed three men board the tricycle of the victim.
[11]


The two accused
also alleged that the victim's widow implicated them when they refused to
involve Barangay Captain Carlito Villanca in the crime.  According to accused Asis, he was offered 
P
30,000.00
by the victim's widow to testify against Villanca.
[12]


  For his part, accused Carino filed a demurrer
to evidence.  He alleged that the only
evidence against him is the extrajudicial admission of the accused Asis which
was executed without the assistance of counsel, and hence, inadmissible.  


On November 7,
1994, the trial court 
convicted accused Asis and Mendoza
 
of murder

and 
acquitted accused Carino
 in a decision
[13]
 containing the following  dispositive portion:


"WHEREFORE, finding both
accused Lorenzo Asis y Gonzales and Romeo Mendoza y Santos guilty beyond
reasonable doubt as principals by direct participation of (sic) the crime of
murder as charged in the information, there being no generic aggravating or
mitigating circumstances considered, each of said accused is hereby sentenced
to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua,
 to indemnify jointly and
severally the heirs of victim-deceased Ernesto Maningas y Sarengo in the amount
of 
P
50,000.00, 
P
16,000.00 incurred for funeral expenses (Exh.
"J") as actual damages, another 
P
50,000.00 as moral damages
and the further amount of 
P
20,000.00 for and as attorney's fees due to
the private prosecution in this case, the latter two (2) amounts subject to the
corresponding filing fees as a first lien, and to pay the costs of proceedings.


"In the service of their
sentence each of the aforenamed accused who have undergone preventive
imprisonment as detention prisoners shall be credited with the full time during
which they have undergone such preventive imprisonment, pursuant to Art. 29 of
the Revised Penal Code.


"For lack of sufficient
evidence against him, thus creating in the mind reasonable doubt as to his
guilt alleged in the information, accused Atanacio Carino y Cruz is hereby
acquitted and this case dismissed insofar as he is concerned. Emelita Mendoza
who is also named as an accused in the information but has not actually been
prosecuted in this case, is considered excluded from the charge.


"Let copies of this decision
be furnished the prosecution, both public and private, the private complainant,
all the accused and their respective counsel, and the Provincial Jail Warden of
Bulacan.


"SO ORDERED."


On November 28,
1994, accused Asis and Mendoza, through counsel, filed their Notice of Appeal.
[14]
 In their Brief, appellants assigned
the following errors committed by the trial court:


"I


"THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN
CONVICTING THE ACCUSED/APPELLANTS DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO
ESTABLISH THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.


"II


"THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN
IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE
PROSECUTION TO SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY QUALIFY THE
KILLING TO MURDER.


"III


"THE
HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING VOLUNTARY SURRENDER OF
ACCUSED/APPELLANT ROMEO MENDOZA AS MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES."
[15]


On March 21,
1997, appellant Mendoza withdrew his appeal.
[16]
 Hence, herein appeal concerns Asis
only.


We sustain
appellant Asis' conviction. 


Appellant
contends that the trial court failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable
doubt considering that the evidence submitted by the prosecution was merely
circumstantial.  In a criminal
prosecution, a conviction may be sustained on the basis of circumstantial
evidence provided that the following requisites are met: (1) there is more than
one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are
proven; and (3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce
a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
[17]
 We find that all these requisites
have been successfully met by the prosecution.  The evidence showed that appellant was one of two persons last seen in
the company of the victim before he was killed.  On the morning that the victim's body was found, the appellant
was observed with his clothes smeared with blood.  Witness dela Cruz saw his left shoulder with bite marks and his
right hand swollen.  When asked about
the  injuries, he admitted engaging in a
fight in Bgy. Pinakpinakan.  On the same
morning, some CAFGU soldiers spotted the appellant with co-accused Mendoza
while walking by the road in Bgy. Caingin.  They had blood-stained clothes.  The two ran away, when pursued. Their flight evinces guilt.  These circumstances taken together lead to
no other conclusion but that the appellant is guilty as charged. 


Appellant failed
to discredit the testimony of prosecution witness dela Cruz who saw him wearing
blood-stained clothes and bearing injuries in different parts of his body.  Neither did he succeed in discrediting the
testimony of Gilbert de Guzman who saw him ride the tricycle of the victim
around the time that he was killed.  We
reject appellant's contention that de Guzman could not have seen him riding the
passenger seat of Maningas' tricycle as it was covered by  canvass (lona) on both sides.
[18]
 We give credence to the testimony
of de Guzman considering that he was only five meters away from the light post
when he saw the victim's tricycle approach and slowed down.  He was also only one meter away from the
victim when he talked with his sister-in-law.
[19]
 De Guzman was thus able to see the
appellant and his co-accused, for while the sides of the tricycle were covered
by a canvass, its front side was not:


"ATTY. BERMAS: 


"Q:
   
Mr. Witness, you mentioned that the tricycle just slacken its
speed, is it not?


"GILBERT DE GUZMAN:


"A: 
  
Yes, sir.


"Q: 
  
It did not have a full stop in front of your house? - I withdraw
that question.


"x x x.


"Q:
   
When the tricycle slackened its speed you   did not come near to the tricycle?


"A:
   
I approached it.


"x x x.


"Q:
  
And this tricycle has a cover in front, is it not? (sic)


"A:
No, sir."
[20]


Worthy to note, witnesses dela Cruz and De Guzman had no ill motive to
testify against the appellant.  


The defense
presented by appellant was alibi. It cannot exculpate him for appellant failed
to prove that it was impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.  Appellant was not able to refute that he was
only a few kilometers away from the scene of the crime when it happened.  In fact, tricycle driver Bernardino brought
appellant and his co-accused to Bgy. Pinakpinakan at around 7:30 to 8:00 in the
evening which was the same time that prosecution witness de Guzman saw the
victim head towards the direction of Bgy. Pinakpinakan. "When averring
alibi, two requirements must be strictly met in order that the same may be of
value to the defense, that is, the accused must prove that he was not present
at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission, and that it was
physically impossible for him to be there at the time.  Without said essential requisites having
been established,  reliance on alibi,
all the more becomes a liability."
[21]


We reject the
allegation of appellant that he was charged because he refused the 
P
30,000.00
offer of Consorcia Maningas, the victim's widow, to testify against accused
Carino and Bgy. Captain Villangca.  What
is more credible is the testimony of Atty. Johannes Ignacio, the lawyer of  Consorcia Maningas that the latter saw
appellant Asis in prison because Asis wanted to be a state witness.
[22]


We now come to
the proper penalty.  Appellant contends
that the trial court erred in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua

despite the failure of the prosecution to show the existence of any
circumstance that may qualify the killing to murder.  We find merit in this argument. The trial court did not state in
its Decision the circumstance which would qualify the killing to murder.  Instead, it declared that: 


"(i)n this case, the
circumstances shown at the trial appear sufficient for conviction of accused
Asis and Mendoza for the crime charged as the actual perpetrators of the
killing of the victim.  Aside from the
fact that they were the last two persons seen in the company of the victim before
he was killed, soon after said killing they were also seen with their clothings
smeared with blood and they themselves had some injuries on their person.  
This could only mean that,
notwithstanding their concerted unexpected attack on the victim as clearly
indicated by the numerous stab wounds he suffered
 
from
 
their
hands, on the back, the chest, the waist, including the mouth and the head, he
managed to put up some fight for dear life, even using his teeth and biting
Asis on the left shoulder.
"


The Solicitor General interpreted this ruling to mean that the trial
court considered abuse of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance.  We disagree with this interpretation.
"Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is a notorious
inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation
of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor selected
or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime."
[23]
 It must be shown by clear and
convincing evidence that this qualifying circumstance was consciously sought by
the assailants.
[24]
 In the case at bar, the fact that
there were two assailants and one of them was armed with a knife does not by
itself show that abuse of superior strength was present.  Mere superiority in number does not indicate
the presence of this circumstance.
[25]
 Nor was it shown that the victim
was weaker in constitution and that he could not have possibly defended himself
from his stronger assailant.  On the
contrary, it appears that the victim was able to put up a fight and even
inflicted several wounds on appellant Asis and his co-accused Mendoza.  


We next consider
whether the prosecution proved the presence of treachery.  Where treachery is alleged, the manner of
attack must be proven.
[26]
 It cannot be presumed or concluded
merely on the basis of the resulting crime.  Thus, we ruled: 


"(t)he
essence of treachery is the swift and unexpected attack without the slightest
provocation by the victim.  In the case
at bar, the victim may have sustained twenty two (22) stab wounds but there is
no evidence as to the manner in which the attack was made or how the stabbing
resulting in her death began and developed.  The existence of treachery cannot be established by mere suppositions
nor drawn from the circumstances that existed prior and after the killing; it
must be proved by clear and convincing evidence or as conclusively as the
killing itself. Where treachery is not adequately proved, appellant can only be
convicted of homicide."
[27]


As there was no
qualifying circumstance, the trial court should have convicted appellant Asis
of homicide and not murder.


IN VIEW
WHEREOF
, the
decision of the Regional Trial Court in Criminal Case No. 1115-M-91 convicting
appellant Asis of MURDER is MODIFIED. We find appellant Asis to be guilty of
HOMICIDE only and impose upon him an indeterminate sentence of 10 years of 
prision
mayor
 as minimum to 17 years and 4 months of 
reclusion temporal
 as
maximum.  No costs.
