CRESER PRECISION SYSTEMS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND FLORO INTERNATIONAL CORP., RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


This petition
for review on 
certiorari
 assails the decision
[1]
. The decision of the Court of
Appeals was penned by Justice Gloria C. Paras and concurred in by Justice
Salome A. Montoya and Justice Hector L. HofileÃ±a.


1 of the Court
of Appeals dated November 9, 1994 in C.A.-G.R. SP. No. 34425 entitled âFloro
International Corp. vs. Hon. Tirso D.C Cruz and Creser Precision System, Inc.â,
the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, THE PETITION IS HEREBY GRANTED. THE COMPLAINT FOR
INJUNCTION AND DAMAGES, CIVIL CASE NO. 93-1856 BEFORE THE RESPONDENT JUDGE IS
HEREBY ORDERED DISMISSED AND HIS ORDERS THEREIN OF DECEMBER 29, 1993 AND MAY
11, 1994 ARE ORDERED SET ASIDE.â


Private
respondent is a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacture, production,
distribution and sale of military armaments, munitions, airmunitions and other
similar materials.
[2]


On January 23,
1990, private respondent was granted by the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and
Technology Transfer (BPTTT), a Letters Patent No. UM-6938
[3]
 covering an aerial fuze which was
published in the September-October 1990, Vol. III, No. 5 issue of the Bureau of
Patentâs Official Gazette.
[4]


Sometime in November
1993, private respondent, through its president, Mr. Gregory Floro, Jr.,
discovered that petitioner submitted samples of its patented 
aerial fuze

to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) for testing. He learned that
petitioner was claiming the aforesaid 
aerial fuze
 as its own and
planning to bid and manufacture the same commercially without license or
authority from private respondent. To protect its right, private respondent on
December 3, 1993, sent a letter
[5]
 to petitioner advising it fro its
existing patent and its rights thereunder, warning petitioner of a possible
court action and/or application for injunction, should it proceed with the
scheduled testing by the military on December 7, 1993.


In response to
private respondentâs demand, petitioner filed on December 8, 1993 a complaint
[6]
 for injunction and damages arising
from the alleged infringement before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City,
Branch 88. The complaint alleged, among others: that petitioner is the first,
true and actual inventor of an aerial fuze denominated as âFuze, PDR 77 CB4â
which is developed as early as December 1981 under the Self-Reliance Defense
Posture Program (SRDP) of the AFP; that sometime in 1986, petitioner began
supplying the AFP with the said aerial fuze; that private respondentâs aerial
fuze is identical in every respect to the petitionerâs fuze; and that the only
difference between the two fuzes are miniscule and merely cosmetic in nature.
Petitioner prayed that a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary
injunction be issued enjoining private respondent including any and all persons
acting on its behalf from manufacturing, marketing and/or profiting therefrom,
and/or from performing any other act in connection therewith or tending to
prejudice and deprive it of any rights, privileges and benefits to which it is
duly entitled as the first, true and actual inventor of the 
aerial fuze.


On December 10,
1993, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order. Thereafter,
hearings were held on the application of petitioner for the issuance of a writ
of preliminary injunction, with both parties presenting their evidence. After
the hearings, the trial court directed the parties to submit their respective
memoranda in support of their positions.


On December 27,
1993, private respondent submitted its memorandum
[7]
 alleging that petitioner has no
cause of action to file a complaint of infringement against it since it has no
patent for the 
aerial fuze
 which it claims to have invented; that
petitionerâs available remedy is to file a petition for cancellation of patent
before the Bureau of Patents; that private respondent as the patent holder
cannot be stripped of its property right over the patented 
aerial fuze

consisting of the exclusive right to manufacture, use and sell the same and
that it stands to suffer irreparable damage and injury if it is enjoined from
the exercise of its property right over its patent.


On December 29,
1993, the trial court issued an Order
[8]
 granting the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction against private respondent the dispositive portion of
which reads:


âWHEREFORE, plaintiffâs
application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is granted
and, upon posting of the corresponding bond by plaintiff in the amount of PHP
200,000.00, let the writ of preliminary injunction be issued by the branch
Clerk of this Court enjoining the defendant and any and all persons acting on
its behalf or by and under its authority, from manufacturing, marketing and/or
selling aerial fuzes identical, to those of plaintiff, and from profiting
therefrom, and/or from performing any other act in connection therewith until
further orders from this Court.â


Private
respondent moved for reconsideration but this was denied by the trial courts in
its Order
[9]
 of May 11, 1994, pertinent portions
of which read:


âFor resolution before
this Court is the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the defendant and the
plaintiffâs Opposition thereto. The Court finds no sufficient cause to
reconsider its order dated December 29, 1993. During the hearing for the
issuance of the preliminary injunction, the plaintiff has amply proven its
entitlement to the relief prayed for. It is undisputed that the plaintiff has
developed its aerial fuze way back in 1981 while the defendant began
manufacturing the same only in 1987. Thus, it is only logical to conclude that
it was the plaintiffâs aerial fuze that was copied or imitated which gives the
plaintiff the right to have the defendant enjoined âfrom manufacturing,
marketing and/or selling aerial fuzes identical to those of the plaintiff, and
from profiting therefrom and/or performing any other act in connection
therewith until further orders from this Court.â With regards to the
defendantâs assertion that an action for infringement may only be brought by
âanyone possessing right, title or interest to the patented invention,â
(Section 42, RA 165) qualified by Section 10, RA 165 to include only âthe first
true and actual inventor, his heirs, legal representatives to assignees,â this court
finds the foregoing to be untenable. Sec. 10 merely enumerates the persons who
may have an invention patented which does not necessarily limit to these
persons the right to institute an action for infringement. Defendant further
contends that the order in issue is disruptive of the 
status quo.
 On the
contrary, the order issued by the Court in effect maintained the 
status quo
.
The last actual , peaceable uncontested status existing prior to this
controversy was the plaintiff manufacturing and selling its own aerial fuzes
PDR 77 CB4 which was ordered stopped through the defendantâs letter. With
issuance of the order, the operations of the plaintiff continue. Lastly, this
court believes that the defendant will not suffer irreparable injury by virtue
of said order. The defendantâs claim is primarily hinged on its patent (Letters
Patent No. UM-6983) the validity of which is being questioned in this case.


WHEREFORE, premises
considered, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby denied for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.â


Aggrieved,
private respondent on June 27, 1994, filed a petition for 
certiorari
,
mandamus and prohibition
[10]
before respondent Court of Appeals
raising as grounds the following:


a.
       
Petitioner has no cause of action for
infringement against private respondent, the latter not having any patent for
the aerial fuze which it claims to have invented and developed and allegedly
infringed by private respondent;


b.
       
The case being an action for cancellation
or invalidation of private respondentâs Letters Patent over its own aerial
fuze, the proper venue is the Office of the Director of Patents;


c.
        
The trial court acted in grave abuse of
discretion and or in excess of jurisdiction in finding that petitioner has
fully established its clear title or right to preliminary injunction;


d.
       
The trial court acted in grave abuse of
discretion and/or in excess of jurisdiction in granting the preliminary
injunction, it being disruptive of the status quo; and


e.
       
The trial court acted in grave abuse of
discretion and/or in excess of jurisdiction in granting the preliminary
injunction thereby depriving private respondent of its property rights over the
patented aerial fuze and cause it irreparable damages.


On November 9,
1994, the respondent court rendered the now assailed decision reversing the
trial courtâs Order of December 29, 1993 and dismissing the complaint filed by
petitioner.


The motion for
reconsideration was also denied on January 17, 1995.
[11]
 Hence, this present petition.


It is
petitionerâs contention that it can file, under Section 42 of the Patent Law
(R.A. 165), an action for infringement not as a patentee but as an entity in
possession of a right, title or interest in and to the patented invention. It
advances the theory that while the absence of a patent may prevent one from
lawfully suing another for infringement of said patent, such absence does not
bar the first true and actual inventor of the patented invention from suing
another who was granted a patent in a suit for declaratory or injunctive relief
recognized under American patent laws. This remedy, petitioner points out, may
be likened to a civil action for infringement under Section 42 of the
Philippine Patent Law.


We find the
above arguments untenable.


Section 42 of
R.A. 165, otherwise known as the Patent Law, explicitly provides:


SECTION. 42. 
Civil
action for infringement.
 â Any patentee, or anyone possessing any right,
title or interest in and to the patented invention, whose rights have been
infringed, may bring a civil action before the proper Court of First Instance
(now Regional Trial court), to recover from the infringer damages sustained by
reason of the infringement and to secure an injunction for the protection of
his right. x x x


Under the
aforequoted law, only the patentee or his successors-in-interest may file an
action for infringement. The phrase â
anyone possessing any right, title or
interest in and to the patented invention
â upon which petitioner maintains
its present suit, refers only to the patenteeâs successors-in-interest,
assignees or grantees since actions for infringement of patent may be brought
in the name of the person or persons interested, whether as patentee, assignees
or grantees, of the exclusive right.
[12]
 Moreover, there can be no
infringement of a patent until a patent has been issued, since whatever right
one has to the invention covered by the patent arises alone from the grant of
patent.
[13]
 In short, a person or entity who
has not been granted letters patent over an invention and has not acquired any
right or title thereto either as assignee or as licensee, has no cause of
action for infringement because the right to maintain an infringement suit
depends on the existence of the patent.
[14]


Petitioner
admits it has no patent over its 
aerial fuze
. Therefore, it has no legal
basis or cause of action to institute the petition for injunction and damages
arising from the alleged infringement by private respondent. While petitioner
claims to be the first inventor of the 
aerial fuze
, still it has no
right of property over the same upon which it can maintain a suit unless it
obtains a patent therefor. Under American jurisprudence, and inventor has no
common-law right to a monopoly of his invention. He has the right to make, use
and vend his own invention, but if he voluntarily discloses it, such as by
offering it for sale, the world is free to copy and use it with impunity. A
patent, however, gives the inventor the right to exclude all others. As a
patentee, he has the exclusive right of making, using or selling the invention.
[15]


Further, the remedy
of declaratory judgment or injunctive suit on patent invalidity relied upon by
petitioner cannot be likened to the civil action for infringement under Section
42 of the Patent Law. The reason for this is that the said remedy is available
only to the patent holder or his successors-in-interest. Thus, anyone who has
no patent over an invention but claims to have a right or interest thereto can
not file an action for declaratory judgment or injunctive suit which is not
recognized in this jurisdiction. Said person, however, is not left without any
remedy. He can, under Section 28 of the aforementioned law, file a petition for
cancellation of the patent within three (3) years from the publication of said
patent with the Director of Patents and raise as ground therefor that the
person to whom the patent was issued is not the true and actual inventor.
Hence, petitionerâs remedy is not to file an action for injunction or
infringement but to file a petition for cancellation of private respondentâ
patent. Petitioner however failed to do so. As such, it can not now assail or
impugn the validity of the private respondentâs letters patent by claiming that
it is the true and actual inventor of the 
aerial fuze
.


Thus, as
correctly ruled by the respondent Court of Appeals in its assailed decision: â
since
the petitioner (private respondent herein) is the patentee of the disputed
invention embraced by letters of patent UM No. 6938 issued to it on January 23,
1990 by the Bureau of Patents, it has in its favor not only the presumption of
validity of its patent, but that of a legal and factual first and true inventor
of the invention.
â


In the case of
Aguas vs. De Leon,
[16]
 we stated that:


âThe validity of the
patent issued by the Philippine Patent Office in favor of the private respondent
and the question over the investments, novelty and usefulness of the improved
process therein specified and described are matters which are better determined
by the Philippines patent Office, composed of experts in their field, have, by
the issuance of the patent in question, accepted the thinness of the private
respondentâs new tiles as a discovery. There is a presumption that the
Philippine Patent Office has correctly determined the patentability of the
improvement by the private respondent of the process in question.â


In fine, in the
absence of error or abuse of power or lack or jurisdiction or grave abuse of
discretion, we sustain the assailed decision of the respondent Court of Appeal.


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Court of
Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.


SO ORDERED.
