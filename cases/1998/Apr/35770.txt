NARVASA, C.J.:


In the special civil action of 
certiorari
 at bar Mayor Felipe
K. Constantino of Malungon, Sarangani Province, seeks invalidation of the
Resolution of the Ombudsman dated October 22, 1996, finding him guilty of grave
misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and/or gross
neglect of duty, and on that account dismissing him from the service.


On February 22, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan of Malungon,
Sarangani Province, adopted and issued Resolution No. 21
[1]
 which -- after declaring in its âWhereasâ
clauses 
inter alia 
  that --


1)  it was the intention of
the ** Government of Malungon to â
lease/purchase
 
  one (1) fleet of heavy equipmentâ
[2]
 composed of seven (7) specifically described
units;


2)  due to the failure of
two public biddings, the Municipal Mayor would be authorized âto enter into a
negotiated contract (for said lease/purchase) ** in behalf of the Municipal
Government ** ;â


3)  the lessor/seller should
assure that the heavy equipment is âfree from defects in workmanship within the
specified warranty period under normal use,â with obligation to ârepair or
replace any defective parts free of charge subject to the terms and conditions
stipulated in the contract;â


4)  the contract "must
be clear and explicit, acceptable to both parties. and be concurred by the
Sangguniang  Bayan of ** Malungon **
before implementation;" and


5)  the heavy equipment
shall, before delivery, be inspected and tested by a special committee chosen
by the Mayor --


authorized Mayor Constatino âto enter
into a negotiated contract representing the Municipality ** (with) any company
dealing with heavy equipment,â said contract to be âsigned by PBAC members.â
The resolution, however, contained no parameters as to rate of rental, period
of lease, purchase price. The Sangguniang Bayan Members who voted for the
resolution were : Vice-Mayor Primitiva L. Espinosa, and Councilors Rafael J.
Suson, Sr. (Presiding Officer), Benjamin M. Guilley, Nemesio P. Liray, Nonito
V. Nunez, Leo G. Ingay, Cesar B. Nallus, Jr., Benjamin C. Asgapo, and Jannette
S. Constatino.


Accordingly, on February 28, 1996 in Davao City, Mayor
Constantino entered into an agreement with a firm called the Norlovanian
Corporation,
[3]
 for the lease by the municipality from the
latter of seven (7) units of heavy equipment of the types specified in the
aforesaid Resolution, to wit:
[4]


(a) one (1) unit payloader;


(b) one (1) unit grader;


(c) one (1) unit road roller;


(d) two (2) units six-wheeler dump trucks; and


(e) two (2) units ten-wheeler dump trucks.


At the same time, and with the Mayorâs â
conforme
,â
the corporation executed a deed of âUndertakingâ binding itself to convey
ownership of the  heavy equipment under
lease âunto the Lessee at the end of the term of said agreement after the
Lessee has faithfully complied with the terms and conditions thereof,â and to
execute âthe necessary documents to transfer the ownership ** (thereof).â
[5]
 The Lease Agreement was a printed pre-prepared
one, the names of the parties and the notarial acknowledgment having merely
been typed in additionally. Nothing was stated in the signed contract about the
term of the lease or the amount of the rental. Neither did the second document,
the âUndertaking,â set forth the term of the lease, the rental rate of the
equipment, or the value thereof.


Delivery of all the seven (7) pieces of heavy equipment was made
to the municipality on March 4, 1996, at which time a document of âDelivery and
Acceptanceâ
[6]
 was executed over the signatures of Mayor
Constantino and the President of the lessor company. The instrument contained:


(a) a list of the equipment,


(b) an averment that the âLESSEEâ (the town of Malungon) had
inspected and accepted the same which had âbeen found to be in good condition
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement,â and


(c) an attestation -- reading âEQUIPMENT INSPECTED BYâ -- signed by
four (4) Municipal 
Kagawads
: Banjamin M. Guilley, Nonito V. Nunez,
Ceasar B. Nallos and Nemesio P. Liray, as well as by the Municipal Engineer and
the Municipal Treasurer.


Thereafter, and on the strength of another resolution (No. 38)
âunanimously approvedâ on April 18, 1996 by the Sangguniang Bayan of Malungon
-- ârequesting the Honorable Municipal Mayor, Felipe K. Constantino, to operate
the newly acquired heavily equipment of the Municipality of Malungon 
leased/purchased
  from the Norlovanian Corporationâ
[7]
 â the mayor directed that the heavy
equipment be operated and used in various projects. The Sangguniang Bayan
Members who voted  for the resolution
were: Vice-Mayor  Primitiva L. Espinosa,
and Councilors Rafael J. Suson, Sr., Benjamin M. Guilley, Nemesio P. Liray,
Pablo V. Octavio, Nonito V. NuÃ±ez, Leo G. Ingay, Cesar B. Nallos, Jr., Benjamin
C. Asgapo, and Wilfredo P. Espinosa, ABC.


However, operation of the equipment came to a halt barely two
months later; and this, because of a third resolution (No. 47) of the Sangguniang
Bayan adopted on June 6, 1996,
[8]
 âstopping all forms of unauthorized payment/expenditures
relative to the illegally acquired pool of heavy equipment by the Municipality
of Malungon, Sarangani Province.â The Resolution was grounded on the following
stated premises:


1) a 1995 Resolution âadopting Appropriation Ordinance No. 11
approving General Budget of 1996;â MPC Resolution No. 2 series of 1995 in
relation to SB Resolution No. 198, series of 1995 âprovided the amount of TWO
MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (
P
2,200,00000) for the loan
amortization of the purchase of heavy equipment for five (5) yearsâ but had
ânot been realigned ** re-programmed and appropriated for lease;â and


2) the âpool of heavy equipment ** acquired was inefficient and
inoperative per ocular inspection, investigation and survey conducted by the
Committee on  Infrastructure of the Sangguniang
Bayan of Malungon and there is no authorized rental payment/expenditures
and  approved budget by the Sangguniang
Bayan intended for lease of such heavy equipment.â


The minutes of the Sangguniang Bayan of Malungon of the Session
of June 6, 1996 show that of the nine (9) Sangunian members present, four (4)
voted âfor the passage of said resolution, namely Councilors Octavio, Espinosa,
Asgapo and Ingay, and three abstain(ed:) namely Councilor Guilley, Nollon,
nunez **; (and) Councilor Liray ** (was) not around during the votation **
(being) on privilege motion which was recognized by the Chairâ (sic).
Vice-Mayor Primitiva L. Espinosa, identified as âActing Mayor,â was recorded as
âABSENTâ
[9]


It appears that earlier -- on April 23, 1996, five (5) days after
Mayor Constantino was requested by the Sangguniang Bayan to start using the
heavy equipment as above stated -- there were filed with the Deputy Ombudsman
for Mindanao in Davao City,
[10]
 a âLetter-Complaintâ
[11]
 and a âJoint Affidavit,â
[12]
 accusing the Mayor and the President of the
Lessor company, Norberto Lindong,
[13]
 of a â
Violation of Section 3 [e] and [g]
of R.A. No. 3019 otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Actâ 
--
docketed as Case No. OMB-MIN-ADM-96-0179 -- and  of â
Grave  Misconduct;
Conduct Prejudicial to the Interest of the Service; and Gross Neglect of Dutyâ
-- 
docketed as Case No. OMB-min-ADM-96-060. The letter-complaint was signed
by Vice-Mayor Primitiva L. Espinosa, and to it was appended a CERTIFICATION
signed by Vice-Mayor and three (3) of the Sangguniang Bayan Members who,
together with the Vice-Mayor, had approved the first two (2) Resolutions above
mentioned, namely: Councilors Rafael j. Suson, Sr., Leo G. Ingay, and Benjamin
C. Agaspo.  Two other councilors,
Wilfredo P. Espinosa, Pablo V. Octavio, who had approved the Resolution of
April 18, 1996 â requesting Mayor Constantino to put into operation the heavy
equipment delivered by Norlovanian Corporation â also signed the Certification.


The Joint Affidavit alleged that:


1) Resolution No. 21 authorized Mayor Constantino âto purchase and
acquire for the Municipality of Malungon heavy equipments to be paid within
five (5) years at the yearly amortization of 
P
2.2 million and for the
ownership thereof to be consolidated and vested upon the municipality at the
end of fifth year;â


2) the resolution also âprovided that the Sangguniang Bayan shall
concur in the contract to purchase that shall be entered into **;â


3) contrary to the resolution, Mayor Constantino entered into
âlease agreement with the Norlovanian Corporationâ over specific heavy
equipment which stipulated a term of  âsix (6) years,â rental at the rate of 
P
257,111.11 per month;â
and â20% Guaranty Deposit of 
P
1,780,000.00â to be made by the
Municipality;â


4) the lease agreement contained no âPurchase Optionâ in favor of
the Municipality, and required the property to be returned to the lessor at the
end of the lease;


5) pursuant to the agreement, the Municipality had already paid to
the Norlovanian Corporation âthe total sum of 
P
2,177,070.91 for:


a) 20% Guaranty Deposit 
                                 
P
1,780,000.00


b) Rental from March 5 - April 5, 1996
  
 
      
  257,111.11


c) partial rental covering April 5 to 


May 6, 1996
                                                       
  162,888.89


Withholding Tax
                                                 
 
          
___


 
22,909.00


TOTAL
                                                   


           
P
2,177,070.91;


6)  Mayor Constantino had
thus entered into the agreement without authority and thereby âcaused and
inflicted undue injury to the Municipality **.â


The charges were traversed by His Honor in a âCounter -
Affidavitâ
[14]
 filed by him on requirement of the Deputy
Ombudsman.
[15]
 He asserted that:


1) under authority of Resolution No.21, he had indeed negotiated
with Norberto Lindong of the Norlovanian Corporation for the lease and ultimate
purchase of the subject heavy equipment;


2) the agreement finally reached was (a) âTotal cost of equipment
is 
P
8,900,000.00;â (b) Norlovanian âwill  charge interest at 18% per annum on a diminishing balance, over a
6 year pay-period;â and (c) âon the first year, the monthly amortization will
be 
P
257,111.11 but starting on the second year the amortization will
decrease and ** progressively decrease every year;â


3) a Committee created by the Mayor inspected and accepted the
units and issued a certification attesting to the âworthinessâ thereof,
[16]
 after  which Lindong drew up the âlease Agreementâ on his companyâs âstandard
(printed) form,â and an âUndertakingâ to eventually transfer ownership of the
equipment to the Municipality;


4) both instruments were signed not only by the Mayor and Lindong
but also by the Members of the PBAC;


5) on February 29, 1996, the Mayor and Lindong appeared before the Sangguniang
Bayan and explained the terms of the  agreements; present were all the Members of the Sangunian except
Vice-Mayor Primitiva Espinosa and her spouse, Councilor Wilfredo Espinosa;


6) the equipment was delivered four (4) days afterwards after which
it was inspected by a representative of the  Commission on Audit who found the same to be in good order;


7) the Mayor subsequently ordered the equipment to be put into
operation in compliance with Resolution No. 38.


On May 31, 1996, respondent Deputy Ombudsman Gervacio handed down
an Order placing Mayor Constantino under preventive suspension for six (6)
months without pay effective June 14, 1996. This order was not enforced,
however, because enjoined by orders
[17]
 promulgated by the Regional Trial Court
[18]
 in Special Civil Case No. 9368 instituted by
the Mayor.


On July 22, 1996, Mayor Constantino and Norberto Lindong filed a
motion for the inhibition of Deputy Ombudsman Gervacio, alleging that by âthe
issuance of the âOrder of preventive Suspensionâ on May 31, 1996 ** 
without
any due process of law
 and in 
utter disregard
 of the provisions of 
Sec.
23 of RA 6770
, the Honorable Deputy Ombudsman ** had 
clearly shown his
prejudice
 against respondent Mayor **.â
[19]
 The motion  was however denied in an Order  issued  by Graft Investigation
Officer Marco Anacleto P. Buena on July 24, 1996.
[20]


On July 26, 1996, Constantino and Lindong filed a âNotice of
Appealâ -- as regards the rejection of the motion for inhibition
[21]
 -- and a âMotion to Reset Hearingâ (after
the resolution of their appeal on the issue of recusation).
[22]
 The latter motion was denied for lack of
merit by the Area Office on July 29, 1996. Said denial was sustained, and Mayor
Constantinoâs appeal dismissed, by Order of Investigation Officer Buena, dated
September 10, 1996,
[23]
 approved by Ombudsman Aniano Desierto on
October 4, 1996.
[24]


Meanwhile, an information for Violation of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act against both Mayor Constantino and Norberto Lindong, was
filed before the Sandiganbayan on August 8, 1996, also with due approval of
Ombudsman Desierto.
[25]


Under date of October 22, 1996, Graft Investigation Officer Buena
handed down a Resolution finding the petitioner âGUILTY of grave misconduct,
prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and gross neglect of duty,â
and ordering his dismissal from the service.
[26]
 That Resolution was, on recommendation of
Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao Margarito P. Gervacio, Jr. (dated October, 25,
1996), approved by Ombudsman Desierto on December 16, 1996.
[27]


The Resolution of October 22, 1996 adverted to 


1) âvarious dubious legal
maneuvers set off by the respondent (Mayor) in an effort to stay the
iimplementation of the order of preventive suspensionâ including the filing of a
motion for reconsideration of the suspension order, the withdrawal of counsel,
the filing of a motion for inhibition of the investigator and to reset
hearings;
[28]


2) what was considered
(a) a strangeness of  âwhy the
respondent (Mayor) and Mr. Lindong went through all the trouble to prepare and
execute two separate agreements when they could have immediately executed the
lease-purchase agreement itself,â
[29]
 (b) a doubt as to the
âvalidity of the Undertaking **, it being a unilateral contract as well as an
ancillary one, as opposed to the principal contract which is the lease
agreement,â in addition to not being âsupported by a consideration;â
[30]
 and (c) the omission of the
assent of the Sangguniang Bayan to the contract before its implementation.
[31]


On the basis thereof, DILG Regional Director Jaime L. Madridano
of Region XI based in Davao City, sent a Memorandum Order dated December 27,
1996 to Governor Priscilla L.  Chiongbian of Sarangani Province, directing her to enforce the directive
for Mayor Constantinoâs dismissal and to install the Vice Mayor in his place.
[32]
 he also issued a âMemorandumâ to Mayor
Constantino directing him âto turn over the functions of (his) office to the
vice-mayor (Primitiva L. Espinosa) pursuant to Sec. 44 of RA 7160 **.â
[33]
 However, this resolution of dismissal has
not been implemented because, as Mayor Constantino himself states,
[34]
 after DILG Director Madridano was advised of
the institution of the action at bar in this Court, he âdid not insist anymore
on the execution of the âResolutionâ (of dismissal) in question.â


Mayor Constantino has appealed the Resolution approved by
Ombudsman Desierto on December 16, 1996 -- removing him from his position as
Municipal Mayor -- by filing the petition for 
certiorari 
at bar.
[35]
 He has impleaded as respondents the
Ombudsman, Deputy Ombudsman Gervacio, Jr., and the complainants in the
administrative case: Vice-Mayor Espinosa, and Councilors Madridano, Octavio,
Ingay, Asgapo, Espinosa and Suson, Sr. And he cites the following as special
and important reasons to justify a review and nullification of the Resolution
issued by respondents Desierto and Gervacio, to wit:


(1) Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to due process
of law when his âMotion for Inhibitionâ, âNotice of Appealâ and Motion to Reset
Hearingâ were denied outright by respondent Gervacio (or graft Investigation
Officer Buena) and not reviewed by respondent Ombudsman Desierto; and


(2) Respondents Desierto and Gervacio gravely abused their
discretion when they pointedly ignored or disregarded the fact that petitioner
merely acted in accordance with Res. No. 21, Series of 1996 and Res. no. 38,
Series of 1996 of the Municipal Council of Malungon, Sarangani, and that he did
not exceed his authority with respect to the transaction and the use of the
seven (7) units of heavy equipment acquired by the town.


Private respondents Primitiva Espinosa, Rafael Suson, Pablo
Octavio, Leo Ingay, Benjamin Asgapo and Wilfredo Espinosa filed a âMotion to
Dismiss,â dated February 3, 1997, which this Court resolved on February 25,
1997, to consider as their comment on the petition. Regional Director Jaime L.
Madridano submitted his comment on the petition, dated February 21, 1997. The
Solicitor General filed a comment in behalf of public respondents, dated April
2, 1997. Mayor Constantino then presented a Reply, dated June 21, 1997, to
private respondentsâ Motion to Dismiss, to which private respondents submitted
a Rejoinder dated July 2, 1997.


The first contention of Mayor Constantino -- that it was error
for his motions for inhibition and to reset hearing ânot (to be) reviewed by
respondent Ombudsman Desiertoâ -- is unmeritorious, and is quickly disposed of
by reference to the terms of Section 28 of Republic Act No. 6770, 
viz
.:
[36]


âSEC 28. 
Investigation in Municipalities, Cities and Provinces.

--The Office of the Ombudsman may establish offices in municipalities, cities
and province outside Metropolitan Manila, under the immediate supervision of
the Deputies for Luzon, Visayas  and
Mindanao, where necessary as determined by the Ombudsman. 
The investigation
of complaints may be assigned to the regional or sectoral deputy concerned or
to special investigator who shall proceed in accordance with the rules or special
investigator who shall proceed in accordance with the rules or to a special
instructions or directives of the Office of the Ombudsman. Pending
investigation, the deputy or investigator may issue orders and provisional
remedies which are immediately  executory
subject to review by the Ombudsman. 
Within three (3) days after concluding
the investigation, the deputy or investigator shall transmit, together with the
entire records of the case, his report and conclusions to the Office of the
Ombudsman. Within five (5) days after receipt of said report, the Ombudsman
shall render the appropriate order, directive or decision.â


The authority of  the  investigator (Buena) to issue the challenged
order. Pending investigation of the administrative case against Mayor Constantino,
cannot thus be gainsaid being specifically conferred by the  provision just quoted. Indeed, any such
order is, according to said provision, âimmediately executory,â subject only to
review by the Ombudsman


Prescinding therefrom, the fact is, as already stated, that the
impugned order was actually reviewed by a superior officer, Director Antonio E.
Valenzuela (September 13, 1996), then recommended for approval by Deputy
Ombudsman Gervacio, and ultimately approved by Ombudsman Desierto on October 4,
1996.
[37]
 The Mayorâs motions therefore received due
attention and consideration although resolved adversely to him. There is no
occasion to speak of a denial of due process. 


More persuasive is the Mayorâs second contention that no
liability, whether criminal or administrative, may be imputed to him since
he  merely complied with the mandate of
Resolution No. 21, series of 1996 and Resolution No. 38, series of 1996, of the
Municipal Council; and that the charges leveled against him are politically
motivated. A thorough examination of the records convinces this Court that the
evidence against him is inadequate to warrant his dismissal from the service on
the specified grounds of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the  service and gross
neglect of duty.


The explicit terms of Resolution No. 21, Series of 1996 clearly
authorized Mayor Constantino to  â
lease/purchase


one (1) fleet of heavy equipmentâ composed of seven (7) generally described
units, through a â
negotiated contract.
â
[38]
 
That resolution, as observed at the outset, contained 
no parameters
as to rate of rental, period of lease, purchase price
. Pursuant thereto,
Mayor Constantino, representing the Municipality of Malungon, and Norbeto
Lindong, representing the Norlivanian Corporation, executed two written
instruments of the same date and occasion, 
viz
.:


One 
-- an agreement(on a standard printed form) dated
February 28, 1996 for the 
lease
 by the corporation to the  municipality of heavy equipment of the
number and description required by Resolution no. 21, and


Two 
-- an undertaking for the 
subsequent conveyance
and transfer of ownership
 of the equipment to the municipality at the
end of the term of the lease.


That the Members of the Sangguniang Bayan knew of this â
lease/purchase
â
is evident from Resolution No. 38, Series of 1996 unanimously enacted by them
shortly after delivery of the equipment.
[39]
 In that resolution they (1) declared that â
the
Municipal Government
 ** 
has just acquired its fleet of heavy equipment 
leased/purchased

from the Norlovanian Corporation
,â and (2) requested Mayor Constantino â
to
operate the newly acquired heavy equipment
 ** 
leased/purchased


from the  Norlovanian Corporation
.
â

The  Resolution is consistent with the
allegations of Mayor Constantino -- which in any event are not denied by the
Councilors or Vice-Mayor Espinosa -- that:


1) the equipment was delivered to the Municipality by Norlovanian
Corporation on February 28, 1996 and duly inspected by Councilors Guilley,
Runez, Nollos and Liray, as well as the Municipal Engineer and the Municipal
Treasurer;


2) prior to the delivery of the units, the Vice Mayor and other
Members of the Sangguniang Bayan had opportunity to read the âLease Agreementâ
as well as the âUndertakingâ but then raised no objections thereto;


3) neither did they raise any objections (a) at the session of the
Municipal Council on February 29, 1996, when Norberto Lindong explained the
terms of the ânegotiated contractâ of âlease/purchase,â or (b) at the time that
the units were delivered and inspected by designated municipal officials.


Now, it is germane to advert to the deplorable inaccuracies in
the Joint Affidavit of private respondents (P.L. Espinosa, Suson, Sr., Ingay,
W. P. Espinosa, Octavio, Asgapo)
[40]
 submitted as part of their  complaint in the Ombudsmanâs Office. The
affidavit contains a 
clearly distorted version of Resolution No. 21
 of
February 22, 1996. In that document   the
affiants described Resolution No. 21 as authorizing Mayor Constantino âto
purchase and acquire ** heavy equipments (sic) to be paid within five (5) years
at the yearly amortization of 
P
2.2 million **.â This is a misleading
reading of Resolution No. 21. As the most cursory perusal of that resolution at
once discloses, what the Mayor was thereby empowered to do was â 
to enter
into  a negotiated contractâ in the
Municipalityâs behalf with âinterested parties,â in line with the expressed
wish of the Municipality to âlease/purchase one (1) fleet of heavy equipment

**â -- not simply to â
purchase and acquire
â said equipment (as
complainant Councilors aver). Neither does Resolution No. 21 state (contrary to
complainantâs description of it) that the price shall be âpaid within five (5)
years at the yearly amortization of 
P
2.2 million **;â indeed. as already
above stressed, the resolution is completely silent as regards any terms and
conditions of the ânegotiated contractâ that the Mayor was assigned to execute
in the townâs behalf. Such obvious distortions cannot but erode the complainant
councilorsâ credibility and 
bona fides
.


It is also relevant to draw attention to the flagrantly
inaccurate statements and inferences about the Mayorâs ânegotiated contractâ
regarding the heavy equipment, contained in Resolution No. 47 approved only by
four (4) Members of the Municipal Council at its session of June 6, 1996 (the
four (4) being Councilors Octavio, Espinosa, Asgapo and Ingay).
[41]
 That  Resolution No. 47, it will be recalled, stopped all ârental
payment/expenditures relative to the pool of heavy equipment of the Norlovanian
Company.â The stoppage was based on 
prior resolutions
  of the Council -- allegedly setting down the
terms under which the heavy equipment should be acquired, and which terms were
supposedly violated by the Mayor. but -- unaccountably and gain indicative of
bad faith, if not malice, on the part of private respondents -- Resolution No.
47 made absolutely no reference to the two (2) resolution which on their face
justify the Mayorâs contract with Norlovanian Corporation, to wit: (1)
Resolution No. 21 which, having been enacted 
after
 
the cited
resolutions, must be deemed to have superseded them, and which, to repeat,
motivated and constitutes the justification for the 
lease-purchase

agreement entered into by the Mayor and Norlovanian Corporation, and (2)
Resolution No. 38 in which the Councilors not only expressly acknowledged that
âthe municipal government ** (had) just acquired its fleet of heavy equipment 
leased/purchased


from the Norlovanian Corporation,
â but also 
ârequested ** (the) Mayor
** to operate the newly acquired heavy equipment of the  municipality 
leased/purchased 
from
the Norlovanian Corporation.â
[42]


In light of the foregoing facts, which appear to the Court to be
quite apparent on the record, it is difficult to perceive how the Office of the
Ombudsman could have arrived at a conclusion of any wrongdoing by the Mayor in
relation to the transaction in question. It is difficult to see how the
transaction between the Mayor and Norlovanian Corporation -- entered into
pursuant to Resolution No. 21 -- and tacitly accepted and approved  by the town Council through its Resolution
No. 38 -- could be deemed an infringement of the same Resolution No. 21. In
truth, an examination of the pertinent writings (the resolutions, the two (2)
instruments constituting the negotiated contract, and the certificate of
delivery) unavoidably confirms their integrity and congruity. It is, in fine,
difficult to see how those pertinent written instruments,â could establish a 
prima
facie
 case to warrant the preventive suspension of Mayor Constantino. A person
with the most elementary grasp of the English language would, from merely
scanning those material documents, at once realize that the Mayor had done
nothing but carry out the expressed wishes of the Sangguniang Bayan.


It would appear that Graft Investigator Buena, who drew up the
Resolution (eventually approved by the Ombudsman) -- finding Mayor Constantino
guilty of grave misconduct or gross neglect of duty -- might have been carried
away by his disapproval of what he thought to be âvarious dubious maneuvers to
delay the early and expedient disposition of ** (the) caseâ resorted to by the
Mayor âthrough his various counsels.â How those âmaneuversâ (assuming their
description as dilatory to be correct) could affect the intrinsic character of
the evidence submitted by the parties is, however, quite beyond the Court.


The investigator also opined that Resolution No. 21 should be
interpreted in light of other official documents, executed a year earlier. He
does not explain why he did not adopt the more obvious construction of
Resolution No. 21 indicated by the elementary doctrine that it is within the
power and prerogative of the town council to repeal its prior acts, either
expressly, or by the passage of essentially inconsistent resolutions. When the
town council passed Resolution No. 21 without any mention whatever of those
prior official documents respecting the acquisition to heavy equipment, the
evident intention was to supersede them and to have such acquisition governed
solely by Resolution No. 21. This conclusion is strongly supported by the fact
that the Sangunian expressly admitted -- in the Second Whereas Clause of its
Resolution No. 21 -- that there had been a â
failure of bidders to submit
bids despite of two biddings ... public announcement
â (sic) -- the two
biddings being obviously related to said earlier official acts of the town
council. The conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that the Council, 
with
full awareness of said ânegotiated contract,â
 and of the delivery of
equipment thereunder, had requested the Mayor to put the equipment into
operation for the town projects. The Court is thus satisfied that  it was in fact the Councilâs intention,
which it expressed in clear language, to confer on the Mayor ample discretion
to execute a ânegotiated contractâ with any interested party, without regard to
any official acts of the Council prior to Resolution No. 21.


It is  also difficult to
see why the patent inaccuracies in the affidavit-complaint and Resolution No.
47
[43]
 were ignored -- as difficult to understand
how the execution of two writings to embody one contract of âlease/purchaseâ
could be regarded as fatally defective, and even indicative of a criminal
conspiracy, or why said two writing should be interpreted in such a way as to
magnify their seeming inconsistencies. the fundamental and familiar legal
principle -- which the Office of the Ombudsman ignored  -- is that it is perfectly legitimate for a
bilateral contract to be embodied in Two or more separate writings, and that in
such an event the writings should be read and interpreted together in such  a way as to eliminate seeming inconsistencies
and render the partiesâ intention effectual.


The statement in the appealed Resolution -- as to the absence of
prior consent of the Council to the ânegotiated contractâ executed by Mayor
Constantino and Norlovanian Corporation -- flies in the teeth of the evidence;
there is unrebutted proof that the heavy equipment delivered to the
Municipality pursuant to the contract, was inspected by designated councilors
and municipal officers; that shortly thereafter, the negotiated contract --
composed of two documents -- was explained and discussed at the session of the
town Council of February 29, 1996; and that afterwards the Council requested
mayor Constantino to put the equipment into operation.


The Court thus considers the ratiocinations and conclusion in the
challenged resolution to be so gravely and egregiously in error as to make
necessary said issuancesâ invalidation by the extraordinary writ of 
certiorari
.


The private respondentsâ amazing turn-about is patent upon the
record, and is branded by Mayor Constantino as a cunning and treacherous
political maneuver -- an attempted coup to oust him from his position as Mayor
otherwise than through the normal process of election. Be this as it may, the Court
cannot and will not allow itself to be made an instrument of politics, nor be
privy to any attempt at the perpetration of injustice.


In view of all the foregoing
, the assailed Resolution of
the respondent ombudsman dated October 22, 1996 dismissing petitioner from the
service, as well as the Order  of
preventive suspension dated May 31, 1996, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE and
petitioner is EXONERATED  from the
administrative charges against him in CASE NO. OMB-MIN-ADM-96-060.
