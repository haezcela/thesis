PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMULO
CARULLO Y BONGAO, JOSE TAULE Y OMADTO, AND VIRGILIO DE LOS REYES Y ABIGANIA, ACCUSED.

ROMULO CARULLO Y BONGAO AND JOSE TAULE Y OMADTO, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.

D E C I S I O NÂ 




MENDOZA, J.:


This is an appeal from a decision of Branch 172 of the Regional
Trial Court of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, in Criminal Case No. 5980-V-83,
finding accused-appellants Romulo Carullo y Bongao and Jose Taule y Omadto
guilty of robbery with homicide and sentencing each of them to suffer three
penalties of 
reclusion perpetua 
and ordering them to indemnify the heirs
of the victim in the amount of P30,000.00.


The third accused, Virgilio de los Reyes, escaped from confinement
before the termination of the trial of the case and has remained at large.


The prosecutionâs evidence shows that in the early morning of
December 9, 1983, herein accused-appellants Romulo Carullo and Jose Taule broke
into the Carolina Hairdresser, a beauty parlor, which also served as the
dwelling of the owner, Carolina Coronel, at Paso de Blas, Valenzuela, by
picking the lock on the door.  They took
valuables from the house, including a cassette recorder, a ladyâs ring, and an
undetermined amount of money.  The three
not only robbed Carolina Coronel but also took turns raping her, with Virgilio
de los Reyes doing it twice.  After he
had finished raping Carolina a second time, De los Reyes banged her head on the
cement floor, causing her death.


The accused-appellants were arrested separately on December 11,
1983.  Each executed an extrajudicial
confession,
[1]
 as did De los Reyes, admitting participation
in the crime.  The extrajudicial
statement of accused-appellant Carullo was taken on December 12, 1983, while
that of accused-appellant Taule was taken on December 13, 1983.  These statements formed part of the
prosecutionâs evidence.


Aside from the confessions, the prosecution also relied on the
testimony of Angelino ObaÃ±a, a security guard at the Canumay Wood Corp. in
Canumay, Valenzuela, that he saw accused-appellants near the scene of the crime
on December 9, 1983.  ObaÃ±a testified
that in the early morning of that day, while he was on duty, he saw accused-appellant
Carullo with two others, whom he did not recognize, near the Canumay Wood
Corp.  According to him, he saw Carullo
enter the house of one Iliong Alejandrino.  When he (Carullo) came out, he was holding a bag.
[2]
 Later in the morning, ObaÃ±a was asked by a
son of Alejandrino if he had seen anyone in the vicinity of their house the
previous night as they had been robbed.
[3]


The prosecution presented as eyewitness Aileen Maclang.  Aileen is the niece of the deceased Carolina
Coronel. On December 8, 1983 she was fetched by the deceased from her house in
Malolos
[4]
 and she spent the night with Coronel. She
was a little over four years old at that time, having been born on March 21,
1979.
[5]
 At the time she was presented for
examination on the witness stand, she was six years old.
[6]


The crime was discovered on the same day it occurred.  Aileen Maclang was taken to the police
station for investigation.  Accused-appellant Carullo and his coaccused De los Reyes were brought
before Aileen Maclang for identification.
[7]


Aileen Maclang pointed to Carullo and De los Reyes as among those
whom she saw inside the parlor.
[8]
 Aileen Maclang said that she was awakened on
the night the incident happened by a noise coming from the sala,
[9]
 where the beauty parlor was located. She
said she peeped through the curtain
[10]
 which covered the doorway leading from the
bedroom to the sala. When she saw the men, she hid under the sink adjacent to
the doorway because she was afraid the three might see her, but, from where she
was, she saw what the three men were doing in the sala.
[11]
 Her aunt, Carolina Coronel, was lying on the
floor.
[12]
 Aileen saw them bind Carolinaâs hands and
feet and hit her on the head.
[13]
 She also saw them taking money from
Carolinaâs wallet which was inside a drawer in the sala.
[14]
 After the men had left, she came out from
under the sink.
[15]
 She approached the body of her aunt and
covered it with a blanket as she cried.
[16]


Aileen saw the faces of the intruders as there was light coming
from the bedroom as well as from the neighboring houses.
[17]
 The men were facing her, she said.
[18]
 In an ocular inspection of the scene of the
crime, she demonstrated to the court the position of Carolina Coronelâs body on
the floor.
[19]
 She said Carolina was killed âby [beside]
the chair.â
[20]
 Indeed, the photograph (Exh. E-3) shows
Carolina Coronel lying dead near a sofa.  She showed the court the positions of the men when she saw them. As
stipulated, the distance between her and the men was less than a meter.
[21]


Aileen identified the accused-appellants and their coaccused De
los Reyes in open court as the men she saw inside Carolinaâs beauty parlor.
[22]
  She
tapped them one by one as they were seated in different places in the
courtroom.
[23]


The defense of each accused-appellant was alibi. Each denied
knowledge of the crime.  Accused-appellant Romulo Carullo claimed that he was at home at Donesa
St., Canumay, Valenzuela the whole day of December 9, 1983.
[24]
 Accused-appellant Jose Taule claimed that,
at the time of the incident, which was the early morning of December 9, 1983,
he was working at the Canumay Wood Corp. in Canumay, Valenzuela.
[25]
 His testimony was corroborated by Pedro
Badiana, a coworker.


Both claimed to have been subjected to various forms of torture
to force them to admit the crime by the police officers who had arrested them.


On September 11, 1987, the trial court rendered judgment, finding
accused-appellants guilty of robbery with homicide, with  the aggravating circumstances of multiple
rape, nocturnity, and abuse of superior strength, as alleged in the
information. Accused-appellants were each sentenced to suffer three penalties
of 
reclusion perpetua 
and to indemnify the heirs of Carolina Coronel in
the amount of P30,000.00
.
[26]


In arriving at its decision, the trial court relied on
accused-appellantsâ confessions, on the testimony of security guard Angelino
ObaÃ±a, who said he saw accused-appellant Carullo, with two others, presumably
accused-appellant Taule and Virgilio de los Reyes, coming out of the house of
Iliong Alejandrino, and on the eyewitness account of Aileen Maclang.  The trial court noted that while Aileenâs
testimony appeared at times to be off-tangent, this could be attributed to the
witnessâ tender age.  Otherwise, Aileen
was able to withstand rigid direct and cross examination and she had no motive
to testify falsely against accused-appellants, according to the court.  Children of her age seldom lie.
[27]


Accused-appellants seek a reversal of the trial courtâs
decision.  Carullo contends that â


1.  THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN
HOLDING THAT SECTION 29, RULE 130 OF THE REVISED RULES OF COURT CAN APPLY, AS
IN FACT IT DID APPLY AGAINST ALL THE ACCUSED, PARTICULARLY ROMULO CARULLO;


2.  THE COURT ERRED IN
CONCLUDING THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS ABLE TO PROVE CORPUS DELICTI; AND,


3.  THE COURT ERRED IN
TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE DEFENSE OF ALIBI ADDUCED BY THE ACCUSED PARTICULARLY
ROMULO CARULLO. 


Similarly, Taule claims that 
-


1.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN
GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE EXTRA-JUDICIAL CONFESSION/ADMISSION OF JOSE
TAULE AS WELL AS HIS CO-ACCUSED.


2.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN
FINDING APPELLANT JOSE TAULEâS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. 


We have examined the records of this case, but we find no reason
to reverse the trial courtâs decision.  We therefore affirm.


First
. We agree with accused-appellantsâ contention that
the trial court erred in admitting their confessions.  It is not denied by the prosecution that accused-appellantsâ
confessions were made without the assistance of counsel.  


With regard to accused-appellant Tauleâs statement, Pfc. Wilfredo
Pagsanjan testified:
[28]


Q:
   
May
we know the reason, Pfc., why the third and the fourth pages was not signed by
Jose Taule?


A:
    
Before
he was able to sign the other pages, there came an attorney.


His answer clearly indicates that Tauleâs
testimony was made without the assistance of counsel.


Accused-appellant Carulloâs statement was likewise given without
the assistance of counsel as the testimony of Pfc. Pagsanjan clearly shows:
[29]


Q:
   
And you proceeded with
the investigation despite the absence of a lawyer?


A:
    
He waived his right.


Q:
   
Was there a lawyer or
none?


A:
    
There was none, sir.


. . . .


Q:
   
And the waiver was signed
by him without also a lawyer?


A:
    
Yes, sir.


Q:
   
And despite that you
proceeded because he waived his right?


A:
    
Yes, sir.


The prosecution contends, however, that, at the time the
statements were given, there was no requirement for assistance of counsel for
there to be a valid waiver of the right to counsel, because this requirement
was put for the first time in Art. III, Â§12 of the 1987 Constitution, which
took effect on February 2, 1987.  The
1973 Constitution did not have a similar provision as Art. III, Â§12.


This contention is mistaken.  As early as April 26, 1983, this Court already ruled in the case of 
Morales
v. Enrile
[30]
 that the assistance of counsel was needed in
order to waive the right to counsel in custodial interrogations.  We there held:  


. . . No custodial investigation shall be conducted unless it be in
the presence of counsel engaged by the person arrested, by any person on his
behalf, or appointed by the court upon petition either of the detainee himself
or by anyone on his behalf. The right to counsel may be waived but the waiver
shall not be valid unless made with the assistance of counsel. Any statement
obtained in violation of the procedure herein laid down, whether exculpatory or
inculpatory, in whole or in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence.
[31]


This ruling was subsequently applied in 
People v. Galit
[32]
 decided on March 20, 1985.


In the case at bar, while the investigating officer testified that
he had advised each of the accused-appellant of their constitutional rights and
that they had all waived assistance of counsel, the waivers were made without
counselâs assistance.  In accordance
with the 
Morales 
rule, therefore, the confessions obtained from them were
inadmissible. Consequently, Â§29 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court
[33]


could not be applied in this case, as
accused-appellants contend. 


Nevertheless, the Solicitor General argues that while under 
People
v. Galit
[34]


waivers of the right to counsel
must be made with the assistance of counsel, in 
People v. Nabaluna
,
[35]
 it was held that this requirement did not
apply to waivers made before March 20, 1985
[36]
 because before that date there were as yet
no guidelines regarding waivers of the right to counsel.
[37]


As already noted, 
People v. Galit
 merely reiterated the
doctrine laid down in 
Morales
 on April 26, 1983.  In 
People v. Nabaluna, 
the Court did
not state that the requirement of counsel for the waiver of the right to
counsel did not apply to waivers made before March 20, 1985.  For the fact was that the decision of the
trial court in that case had already been rendered and the confessions of the
accused had been previously admitted before the date of the decision in 
Morales
.


In contrast, the confessions in this case were made under the
regime of 
Morales
 and therefore came under its proscription.  Hence their admission by the trial court was
erroneous.  


Accused-appellants further claim that they were tortured by the
police officers who arrested and interrogated them to force them to confess to
the crime.  The conclusion we have
reached on the question of admissibility of confession makes it unnecessary to
pass upon this contention.  


Second
.  We
likewise agree with accused-appellants that it was error for the trial court to
have relied on the testimony of Angelino ObaÃ±a, a security guard at the Canumay
Wood Corp. ObaÃ±aâs testimony is to the effect that he had seen
accused-appellant Carullo, together with accused-appellant Taule, coming out of
the house of a certain Iliong Alejandrino.  But, as accused-appellants contend, assuming that they had indeed robbed
the house of Alejandrino, that does not prove that they were also responsible
for the robbery with homicide of which they now stand accused.  This contention of accused-appellants is
well taken.


Third
.  We hold,
however, that the trial court correctly based its decision on the testimony of
Aileen Maclang.  Accused-appellants
claim that Aileenâs testimony is so riddled with inconsistencies which cast
doubts on its truthfulness.  Accused-appellants make much of the fact that even the trial court said
that Maclangâs testimony was at times off-tangent.


It is settled that minor inconsistencies do not affect the
credibility of witnesses.  On the contrary,
they may even tend to strengthen their credibility.
[38]
 What is impressive is that this child was
able to pick the three out of the crowd in the courtroom when asked to identify
them.  The three were seated in
different places of the courtroom.  Aileen identified the three accused as the ones she had seen kill her
aunt, Carolina Coronel.


Accused-appellant Carullo questions how Aileen could have
identified him and his co-accused when, as she said, she only looked at the men
for a short while and the sala where the incident happened was not lighted.
[39]
 On the other hand, accused-appellant Taule
points out that Aileen was only four years old when the incident happened and
was not asked to testify until three years later. According to Taule, it is
incredible for Aileen to be able to identify the culprits after three
years.  


In the first place, âthree yearsâ is inaccurate.  When Aileen first testified on September 6,
1985, it was less than two years after the incident which occurred on December
9, 1983.


In the second place, it should not be forgotten that Aileen was
only six years old when she testified so that her estimate at the time she
looked at the men may not be accurate.  What is important is that, as far as she was concerned, the time was
long enough for her to be able to identify the assailants of her aunt and to
recognize them less than two years after the incident when she saw them
again.  That the incident had been
etched clearly in the childâs mind is not far-fetched.


As to the source of light that illuminated the sala and the faces
of the offenders, Aileen testified that it came from the light in the bedroom
and the light from the neighboring houses. During the ocular inspection, Aileen
showed the trial court the relative positions of the three men when she saw
them just a meter away. It is therefore not incredible for her to have seen the
faces of the intruders long enough to be able to recognize them later on.  Besides, the men were facing her when she
saw them.


Accused-appellants wonder how Aileen could have seen the
assailants bind Carolinaâs hands and feet when they allegedly did this behind a
concrete wall separating the bedroom from the sala.
[40]
 The record does not show that the assailants
were in fact behind the concrete wall.  During the ocular inspection, Aileen pointed to a place in the middle of
the sala where she said the assailants were. There was no mention at all as to
where the concrete wall was in relation to the spot where, according to Aileen,
she was so that it could have obstructed her view.  


Nor did Aileenâs tender age, three at the time of the incident,
in any way affect her credibility.  There is no rule prescribing a minimum age for witnesses.  The rule is that anyone who can perceive
and, perceiving, can make known his perceptions may be a witness.
[41]
 Thus, even a child can be a witness so long
as he can perceive and relate his perceptions:


. . . [T]he test of an infantâs competency to testify is his
capacity to receive just impressions of the facts to which he has to testify
and to relate such impressions truly.  If he possesses the necessary mental capacity to that effect and
comprehends the obligation of an oath, he is a competent witness.
[42]


Aileen Maclang satisfies the foregoing requirements.  She knows that it is not right to tell a
lie.
[43]
 She was able, during the trial, to relate
what she saw on the night the crime happened.


Indeed, this is not the first time a child of tender years
testified in court and her testimony was given weight, perhaps even greater
than that given to adult witnesses.  After all, it took a child to point out that the emperor was naked.  In 
Collado v. IAC,
[44]
 
it was a five-year-old boy who testified as to the identity of a man
who attempted to molest his mother.  The
room where the incident occurred was lighted only by a gas lamp (
gasera
).  The Court held that âthe testimony of
children of sound mind is likely to be more correct and truthful than that of
older persons.â
[45]


In 
People v. Mesias
,
[46]
 it was a six-year-old boy who also testified
regarding the identity of the man who stabbed and killed his father.  We reiterated in that case the view that
â[c]hildren of sound mind are likely to be more observant of incidents which
take place within their view than older persons, and their testimony is
therefore likely to be more correct in detail than that of older persons. . .â
[47]


We are convinced of the truthfulness of Aileenâs Maclangâs
narration.


Accused-appellants point to inconsistencies in her testimony
regarding the source of the light that filtered through the sala.
[48]
 Did it come from the bedroom or from the
neighboring houses? When questioned by the trial court, Aileen testified that
there was light coming from both the bedroom and the neighboring houses.  At one point, she mentioned that there was
also light coming from the moon.  By
that time, however, she must have already been rattled by the relentless
questioning to which she was being subjected.  This contradiction is not enough to destroy her credibility, however.


It must be pointed out that Carolina Coronelâs shop, which served
also as her dwelling was only five meters by five meters,
[49]
 or twenty-five square meters in area.  It was divided into a sala, where the beauty
parlor was, and a bedroom.
[50]
 It is true that a concrete wall separated
the two rooms, but there was an open doorway.
[51]
 The bedroom was lighted by a fluorescent
lamp in the center of a âstoopingâ (most probably sloping or inclined) ceiling.
[52]
 The light in the bedroom could easily
illuminate the sala as well, particularly considering the areaâs small size,
even if a wall separated the two rooms. It must also be noted that only a
curtain covered the doorway.
[53]
 Aileen parted this curtain as she tried to
see what was going on in the sala.  It
is possible for light to have shone through the curtain
[54]
 and through its parting.


Aileen testified that she was crying while standing by the
bedroom door, and accused-appellants wonder why none of the men she saw even
noticed her.
[55]
 This is misleading.  There is no evidence to show that they could
not have failed to notice her if she was there near the door to the
bedroom.  At any rate, this is
irrelevant to the question as to whether or not 
she
 
saw them
.


In his separate brief, accused-appellant Taule asserts that if
Aileen was crying, at the time of the incident, she could not have seen the
whole incident happen.  Crying would
diminish her attentiveness it is said.  And if she was crying, it is asked, why did that not invite the
attention of other people?  


Crying for a stretch of time may or may not affect a personâs
attentiveness.  In the case of Aileen,
it is apparent that it did not prevent her from identifying the men who robbed
and killed her aunt.  She was crying
precisely because of what she was witnessing.   Besides, it is unlikely that she really cried for two hours. The
two hours she mentioned was the mere estimate of a six-year-old child. As to
Aileenâs crying calling the attention of other people, that is mere speculation
that does not need to be discussed.


Accused-appellants point out that Aileen could not have witnessed
the incident because, according to her, she slept at 2:00 in the morning on the
day of the incident and woke up at 10:00 in the morning the following day.
[56]
 Again, this seeming inconsistency in
Aileenâs estimate can easily be explained by her tender age.  It must be remembered that Aileen was a mere
child who cannot be faulted for making inaccurate estimates as to time.


Fourth.
 Accused-appellantsâ defense is alibi.  Carullo claimed he was at home at the time
the incident happened.  Taule, on the
other hand, claimed he was in his place of work and his testimony was
corroborated by a co-worker. Home for Carullo was at Donesa St., Canumay, Valenzuela,
while work for Taule was at the Canumay Wood Corp., also in Canumay,
Valenzuela.  The incident happened at
Paso de Blas, also in Valenzuela.  Canumay is less than two kilometers away from Paso de Blas. One could
reach Paso de Blas from Canumay in less than five minutes.
[57]


For alibi to prosper, it is not enough for accused-appellants to
prove that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed.  They must likewise demonstrate that they
were so far away that they could not have been present at the place of the
crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.
[58]


Indeed, alibi is the weakest of defenses.  Between the defense of alibi and the
positive identification of the accused as perpetrator of the felony, the latter
will prevail.
[59]


For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court correctly
found accused-appellants guilty of robbery with homicide.  It is apparent that the main purpose of
accused-appellants in entering Coronelâs house was to commit robbery.  It could not have been to kill Coronel as
they themselves said they did not even know Coronel. They killed Coronel only
when she woke up, saw them, and presumably tried to resist them.


Under Art. 293 of the Revised Penal Code, robbery is committed by
one who:


with intent to gain,
shall take any personal property belonging to another, by means of violence
against or intimidation of any person, or using force upon anything . . . .


Under Art. 294
[60]
 of the same Code:


Robbery with
violence against or intimidation of persons - Penalties
. 
-
 Any person guilty of robbery with the use of
violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:


1.  The penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 to
death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide
shall have been committed.


Aileen testified that she saw the accused-appellants take money
from a wallet in a drawer.
[61]
 Carolina Coronelâs sister, Josefina,
likewise testified that several valuables, including a cassette, a tape
recorder, and a ring, were taken from Carolina Coronelâs house.
[62]
 We have no reason to doubt their
testimony.  As already stated,
accused-appellants broke into the victimâs residence by picking the lock on the
door.  All the elements of robbery, were
present,
 i.e., 
(a) personal property belonging to another, (b) was
unlawfully taken, (c) with intent to gain, and (d) with the use of force upon
things.  Since the killing was committed
by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, accused-appellants are guilty of
robbery with homicide under Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code.
[63]


The trial court took into account the aggravating circumstances
of nocturnity and abuse of superior strength in this case.
[64]
 Accused-appellant Carullo questions the
appreciation of these circumstances.  Indeed, it has not been shown that nocturnity was purposely sought by
accused-appellants to avoid detection or to facilitate the commission of the
crime or the escape of the criminals.
[65]
 We think the trial court correctly found
there was abuse of superior strength, since accused-appellants and Virgilio de
los Reyes took advantage of their combined strength and number in overpowering
Carolina Coronel.
[66]
 However, there was treachery, considering
that the victim was bound hand and foot which rendered her helpless.
[67]
 Although there was abuse of superior
strength, this circumstance was absorbed by treachery.
[68]
 There was also the aggravating circumstance
of dwelling,
[69]
 in addition to rape as found by the trial
court.
[70]


In sum, there was treachery, dwelling, and rape which would have
required the imposition of the death penalty.  However, in view of the 1987 Constitution, which suspended the
imposition of the death penalty, the only penalty which could be imposed in
this case, considering the presence of aggravating circumstances and the
absence of any mitigating circumstance, was 
reclusion perpetua
 only.
[71]

This rule has not been changed by the enactment of R.A. No. 7659 as the said
law does not apply to crimes committed prior to its effectivity.
[72]


The trial court correctly imposed the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua.
[73]
 But we think the trial court erred in
sentencing each of accused-appellants to three counts of 
reclusion perpetua
.
[74]
 Even though conspiracy has been established,
the fact is that the information charged only one crime of robbery with
homicide.  Accordingly, the penalty for
each accused-appellant must be modified. Also, accused-appellantsâ liability
for indemnity for the death of Carolina Coronel should be increased to 
P
50,000.00
in accordance with our recent cases, not 
P
30,000.00 as held by the trial
court.
[75]


WHEREFORE
, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED, with
the MODIFICATION that the indemnity to the heirs of the deceased Carolina
Coronel is increased to 
P
50,000.00 and accused-appellants Romulo Carullo
y Bongao and Jose Taule y Omadto are each sentenced to one count of 
reclusion
perpetua 
only.


SO ORDERED.

and

Martinez, JJ.,

In People 
v.
 Salvatierra, 257
SCRA 489 (1996) it was held that where rape and homicide coexist in the commission
of robbery, Art. 294(1) applies, the rape being an aggravating circumstance.

[73]
 
Its identification
of this penalty with life imprisonment is erroneous.  It is now settled that 
reclusion perpetua 
and the penalty
of life imprisonment are distinct from each other, 
reclusion perpetua 
having
a specific duration and corresponding accessory penalties.
