EDUARDO V. ROQUERO, PETITIONER,
VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, REYNALDO A. VILLANO, AND HONORABLE OSCAR P.
BARRIENTOS, PRESIDING JUDGE, RTC, BRANCH 82, MALOLOS, BULACAN, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:


This petition
for 
certiorari
 and prohibition impugns the Resolution of respondent
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dated January 28, 1997, dismissing the
petition for 
certiorari
 and prohibition filed by petitioner Eduardo V.
Roquero.


The relevant
antecedents are as follows:


Petitioner Eduardo V. Roquero and
private respondent Reynaldo A. Villano were candidates for Mayor of San Jose
del Monte, Bulacan during the local elections held on May 8, 1995.


On July 18, 1995, respondent
COMELEC issued an order directing the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) to
reconvene, prepare the certificate of canvass and proclaim the winning
candidates in said municipality.


On July 19, 1995, the MBC
proclaimed petitioner Roquero as the duly elected Mayor of San Jose del Monte,
Bulacan garnering 20,131 votes to private respondent Villanoâs 18,312 votes.


Thereafter, or on July 24, 1995,
private respondent Villano filed a motion for reconsideration of the COMELEC
Order dated July 18, 1995.


Said motion for reconsideration was
denied by the COMELEC on September 8, 1995 in a resolution received by private
respondent Villano on September 11, 1995.


On October 10, 1995, private
respondent filed a petition for 
certiorari
 before this Court assailing
the COMELECâs denial of his motion for reconsideration.


On January 30, 1996, this Court
issued a resolution dismissing said petition.  A reconsideration of the same resolution was denied on April 16,
1996.  This resolution was received by
private respondent Villano on May 7, 1996.


On May 17, 1996, private respondent
Villano filed an election protest before the Regional Trial Court of Malolos,
Bulacan, Branch 82, docketed as Election Case No. 01-M-96.


On June 4, 1996, before summons
were served to petitioner Roquero, private respondent Villano filed a
supplemental petition enumerating the 104 precincts of San Jose del Monte he
was contesting.


On June 14, 1996, petitioner
Roquero filed an answer with omnibus motion and counter-protest.


On July 15, 1996, petitioner filed
a motion to dismiss on the ground that the election protest did not allege
facts constituting a cause of action for an election protest and that the
election protest was filed beyond the ten-day reglementary period for filing
the same.


On August 29, 1996, respondent
judge Oscar P. Barrientos issued an order denying petitioner Roqueroâs motion
to dismiss.  A subsequent Order dated
September 3, 1996 was likewise issued directing the parties to nominate their
respective representatives to serve as members of the Committee on Revision
which was set to start its revision and/or recounting of ballots on September
16, 1996.


Aggrieved by the issuance of the
foregoing orders, petitioner Roquero filed a petition for 
certiorari
 and
prohibition before respondent COMELEC, docketed as SPR No. 38-96 on the
following grounds, to wit:


A.  Respondent Court committed grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack
or excess of jurisdiction in not dismissing protestantâs petition/protest for
failure to state ultimate facts to constitute a cause of action.


B.  Respondent Court committed grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack
or excess of jurisdiction in admitting protestantâs supplemental
petition/protest which was filed without leave of court.


C.  Respondent Court committed grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack
or excess of jurisdiction by giving due course to protestantâs supplemental
petition/protest despite that the same was filed outside of the reglementary
period.


D.  Respondent court abused its discretion tantamount to lack or excess of
jurisdiction by setting the revision or recounting of ballots in violation of
Sec. 2, Rule 35 in conjunction with Sec. 2, Rule 17 of the Comelec Rules of
Procedure
.
[1]


On January 28, 1997, respondent
COMELEC issued the questioned resolution (1) dismissing the petition for lack
of merit and (2) directing the RTC to proceed with the revision of ballots and
decide the election protest with dispatch.
[2]


In brushing
aside petitioner Roqueroâs claim that respondent Villanoâs protest was filed
out of time, the COMELEC ratiocinated:


Anent Protesteeâs further
allegations that the protest (together with the supplement) was filed out of
time and that the said supplement was filed by lawyers who had not entered
their appearance, the same are instantaneously rejected because by law and
jurisprudence which need no citation for being so elementary, in the
computation of the period, the first day shall be excluded and the last day
included.  Suffice is it to say that
said protest was filed on time as after having received the Supreme Court
resolution denying their motion to dismiss on May 7, 1996 an election protest
had been filed in this Court on May 17, 1996.
[3]


Hence, the
present petition raising the following issues:


WHETHER OR NOT THE COMELEC COMMITTED
GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN RULING THAT THE MERE ALLEGATION OF FRAUD IS
SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE BALLOT BOX.


WHETHER OR NOT THE COMELEC
COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN RULING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTâS
ELECTION PROTEST STATES A CAUSE OF ACTION.


WHETHER OR NOT THE COMELEC
COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN NOT RULING THAT THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTâS
SUPPLEMENTAL PROTEST IS INADMISSIBLE FOR HAVING BEEN FILED WITHOUT LEAVE OF
COURT.


WHETHER OR NOT THE COMELEC
COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN NOT RULING THAT THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTâS
ELECTION PROTEST WAS FILED OUT OF TIME.
[4]


The main
question to be resolved is:  Was the
election protest filed by private respondent Villano filed on time?


The COMELEC, in
ruling that the election protest was filed on time, merely reckoned the 10-day
period from May 7, 1996 (which was the receipt by respondent Villano of this
Courtâs resolution denying his motion for reconsideration of the resolution
dismissing his petition) to May 17, 1996 when he filed his election
protest.  In computing the 10-day
period, the COMELEC did not consider the running of the period from the date of
proclamation of the petitioner candidate to the date the pleading was filed
with the COMELEC to annul or suspend the proclamation; and from the time
private respondent received the ruling of the COMELEC denying the petition, to
the time he filed the petition before this Court questioning the COMELECâs
ruling.


Section 251 of
the Omnibus Election Code provides:


SEC. 251.  
Election contests for municipal offices.
-  A sworn petition contesting the election of
a municipal officer shall be filed with the proper regional trial court by any
candidate who has duly filed a certificate of candidacy and has been voted for
the same office, within ten days after proclamation of the results of the
election.  (
Art. XVIII, Sec. 190,
1978 EC)


Petitioner
Roquero was proclaimed by the MBC as the duly elected mayor of San Jose del
Monte, Bulacan on July 19, 1995.  Five
(5) days later, or on July 24, 1995, private respondent Villano filed with
respondent COMELEC a pre-proclamation motion for reconsideration assailing the
latterâs order directing the MBC to proclaim petitioner Roquero as the winning
candidate for the mayoralty of the said municipality.  Consequently, only five (5) days of the ten (10) day
reglementary period to file an election protest remained. 


Section 248 of
the same Election Code is clear and provides thusly:


Sec. 248.  
Effect of filing petition to annul or to
suspend the proclamation.
-  The filing
with the Commission of a petition to annul or to suspend the proclamation of
any candidate shall suspend the running of the period within which to file an
election protest or 
quo warranto
 proceedings.


Applying the above provision to the instant case, the ten (10) day
reglementary period was suspended during the pendency of the pre-proclamation
case in the COMELEC and in this Court, until private respondent Villano
received a copy of this Courtâs Resolution dated April 16, 1996 denying his
motion for reconsideration on May 7, 1996.  Verily, on May 7, 1996, the five-day remainder of the reglementary
period to file an election protest resumed to run again and expired on May 12,
1996.  Private respondent Villano
therefore belatedly filed his election protest  on May 17, 1996, five (5) days after the deadline for filing the same.
[5]


The rule
prescribing the ten-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and the filing
of an election protest beyond the period deprives the court of  jurisdiction over the protest.
[6]
 Violation of this rule should not
be taken lightly nor should it be brushed aside as a mere procedural lapse that
can be overlooked.  The rule is not a
mere technicality but an essential requirement, the non-compliance of which
would oust  the court of   jurisdiction over the case.


In 
Lim vs.
COMELEC
,
[7]
 citing
. Kho vs. COMELEC
,
[8]
 
this Court reiterated the long standing rule that a
counterprotest must be filed within the period provided by law, otherwise, the
court acquires no jurisdiction to entertain it.
[9]


Relatedly, if
the docket fees are not fully paid on time, even if the election protest is
timely filed, the court is deprived of jurisdiction over the case.
[10]


The Court would
like to take note also of petitioner Roqueroâs contention that private
respondent Villano should have filed his election protest on September 17, 1995
(should be September 16, 1995), five (5) days after he received a copy of the
COMELEC resolution deying his motion for reconsideration on September 11, 1995.


The running of
the reglementary period to file an election protest is tolled by a partyâs
elevation to the Supreme Court of a COMELEC decision or resolution of a
pre-proclamation case.  The appeal by 
certiorari

to this Court is part of an entire proceeding.  The case is not terminated until this Court has rendered judgment.  Consequently, the computation of the
ten-day period, or the remainder of said period for filing an election contest,
as in this case, does not commence to run until this Court hands down its
verdict.
[11]


Anent the rest
of the errors raised, we find no reason to discuss the same, they having been
rendered moot and inutile by the preceding disquisition.


For all the
foregoing, this Court holds that respondent COMELEC committed grave abuse of
discretion in denying petitioner Roqueroâs petition for 
certiorari
 and
prohibition.


WHEREFORE,
 the present petition for 
certiorari

is hereby given DUE COURSE
 
and is accordingly GRANTED.
 
The Resolution dated January 28, 1997 of
respondent Commission on Elections in SPR No. 38-96 and the Orders dated August
29, 1996  and September 3, 1996 of the
Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 82, in Election Case No.
01-M-96 are hereby ANNULLED

Necessarily, Election Case No. 01-M-96 is ordered DISMISSED

SEPARATE OPINION


DAVIDE, JR., 
J
.:


I concur with
the majority that the election protest filed on 17 May 1996 by private
respondent Villano with the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan was indeed
filed late, but for another reason.


The MBC of San
Jose del Monte, Bulacan, proclaimed petitioner victorious on 19 July 1995
pursuant to the 18 July 1995 Order of the COMELEC directing the MBC to
reconvene, prepare the certificate of canvass and proclaim the winning
candidates.  The motion to reconsider
said order filed on 24 July 1995 did not suspend the running of the period to
file an election protest as there was no indication that private respondent had
likewise asked to annul the proclamation, pursuant to Section 248 of the
Omnibus Election Code which explicitly provides that it is the âfiling with the
Commission of a petition to annul or suspend the proclamation of any candidateâ
which âsuspend[s] the running of the period within which to file an election
protest or 
quo warranto
 proceedings.â Neither was the period to file the
election protest tolled by the pendency before this Court of the special civil
action for 
certiorari 
  private
respondent filed to impugn the COMELEC order of 8 September 1995 denying
private respondentâs motion to reconsider the 18 July 1995 order since this
Court did not issue a temporary restraining order.
