HEIRS OF LEOPOLDO VENCILAO, SR., REPRESENTED BY THEIR
ADMINISTRATOR ELPIDIO VENCILAO, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS,
SPOUSES SABAS AND RUPERTA GEPALAGO, AND DOMICIANO GEPALAGO, RESPONDENTS.

BELLOSILLO, J.:


Between two (2) sets of claimants of real property - those
claiming ownership by acquisitive prescription, and those asserting ownership
on the basis of a deed of sale recorded in the certificate of title of the
vendor as mortgagee and highest bidder in a foreclosure sale - who has a better
right?


On 12 February 1990 the heirs of Leopoldo Vencilao Sr.,
represented by their Administrator Elpidio Vencilao, filed with the Regional
Trial Court of Bohol a complaint for quieting of title, recovery of possession
and/or ownership, accounting and damages with prayer for the issuance of writs
of preliminary prohibitory and mandatory injunction against the spouses Sabas
and Ruperta Gepalago.
[1]
 The complaint was subsequently amended to
include an action for reconveyance and cancellation of title and to implead
defendant Domiciano Gepalago.
[2]


The heirs of Leopoldo Vencilao Sr. alleged that they were the
absolute owners of a parcel of land situated in Cambansag, San Isidro, Bohol,
with an area of 3,625 square meters having inherited the same from their
father, Leopoldo Vencilao Sr., who during his lifetime was in peaceful, open,
notorious and uninterrupted possession and enjoyment of the property in the
concept of owner, declared the property for taxation purposes under Tax
Declaration No. 37C6-344 and religiously paid the real estate taxes.  He likewise had the property consistently
declared as his own in other documents, e.g., those relevant to the 1987
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).
 
After his death, his heirs continued to possess and enjoy the
property. 


The Gepalago spouses, on the other hand, denied all the material
allegations in the complaint and claimed that they were the registered owners
of a 5,970-square meter property located in Candungao Calapo, San Isidro,
Bohol, and covered by TCT No. 16042, previously a portion of a 1,401,570
square-meter land originally owned by a certain Pedro Luspo.  The entire parcel of land was mortgaged by
Pedro Luspo to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) as security  for  a loan.  Since  Luspo  failed  to  pay  the  obligation  upon  maturity  the mortgage was foreclosed.  Thereafter  PNB,  the  highest  bidder  in  the foreclosure sale, conveyed the whole
property to fifty-six (56) vendees among  whom were the spouses Sabas and Ruperta Gepalago who acquired the 5,970
square-meter portion thereof.  Since
then, they had been the owner and possessor of the land until they donated the
same in 1988 to their son Domiciano Gepalago.


The trial court appointed a commissioner to survey the litigated
property and determine the areas claimed by both parties.  The commissioner reported that the area
claimed by the Vencilaos was included in the titled property of the Gepalagos.  On the basis of the commissionerâs report and
the other pieces of evidence presented by the parties, the trial court found
the following:  (a) The property claimed
by the Gepalagos consisted of 5,970 square meters, while that of the Vencilaos
covered an area of 22,401.58 square meters as indicated in the survey plan
submitted by Engr. Jesus H. Sarmiento, the court appointed commissioner; (b)
Insofar as the survey plan and report submitted by Engr. Sarmiento were
concerned, these indubitably established the fact that the Vencilaos owned the
excess area of 16,431.58 square meters which was clearly outside the area
claimed by the Gepalagos; (c) The lot in question had been titled to defendant
Sabas Gepalago and subsequently titled to his son, defendant Domiciano
Gepalago, under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 18621 by virtue of a
deed  of donation executed on 25 October
1988 by Sabas Gepalago in favor of Domiciano Gepalago;  and, (d) As stated in the commissionerâs
report,  "If the titled lot of
Domiciano Gepalago is plotted in accordance with the technical description
appearing in the title, it will be relocated to more than 219 kilometers
eastward away from its supposed actual location.  This amounts to its non-existence."
[3]


The trial court then ruled in favor of the Vencilaos holding that
they had been in possession, cultivation and enjoyment of the litigated
property for more than thirty (30) years and that the improvements therein were
introduced by them long before any title was ever issued to the Gepalagos.  The lower court added that there was ample
evidence showing that the Gepalagos knew when they bought the property from PNB
that the land had long been possessed and enjoyed in the concept of owners by
the Vencilaos.  Thus, while under
ordinary circumstances a certificate of title is indefeasible, it is not so
when a person with prior knowledge of the ownership and possession of the land
by another obtains title to it. 


The Gepalagos appealed the decision of the trial court.  After due consideration, the Court of
Appeals reversed the trial court and declared the Gepalagos owners of the
disputed property -


Evidently, defendant-appellants spouses Gepalago were purchasers in
good faith and for value.  They acquired
their share in the property from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which was
the registered owner.  Even assuming
they had knowledge of the plaintiff-appellees' possession of the said property
at the time of the purchase, it was PNB which was the registered owner of the
property.  The title was transferred to
the bank after the foreclosure sale of the property mortgaged by the previous
registered owner, Pedro Luspo. Thus where the certificate of title is in the
name of the vendor when the land is sold, the vendee for value has the right to
rely on what appears on the certificate of title.  The rule that all persons dealing with property covered by
Torrens Certificate of Title are not required to go beyond what appears on the
face of the title is well-settled.


Granting that plaintiff-appellees were possessors of the property
for a long time, they never raised objections to the transactions affecting the
land.  There was no action made or any
protest recorded with the Register of Deeds.


Defendant-appellantsâ claim of ownership was evidenced by
certificates of title issued in their names.  A Torrens Certificate of Title is the best evidence of ownership of a
registered land.  As against the
allegations of plaintiff-appellees, defendant-appellants are the ones entitled
to the property.  Defendant-appellantsâ
ownership of the property was evidenced by a certificate of title while
plaintiff-appellees relied merely on tax declaration.  Torrens title is generally a conclusive evidence of the ownership
of the land referred to therein. Defendant-appellants acquired the land in a
foreclosure sale and there was no evidence to show that plaintiff-appellees
were defrauded when the property was mortgaged and then sold  x x x x 
[4]


The motion for reconsideration by the Vencilaos having been
denied
[5]

they filed the instant petition for review.  


In awarding the disputed land to petitioners, the trial court
erroneously found that petitioners had been in possession and enjoyment of the
property for more than thirty (30) years.  It should be noted that the land in dispute is a registered land placed
under the operation of the Torrens system way back in 1959, or more than thirty
(30) years before petitioners instituted the present action in the court a
quo,  and for which Original Certificate
of Title No. 400 was issued.
[6]

The rule is well-settled that prescription does not run against registered
land.  Thus, under Sec. 47 of PD 1529,
otherwise known as the 
Property Registration Decree
, it is specifically
provided that  "no title to
registered land in derogation of that of the registered owner shall be acquired
by prescription or adverse possession."  A title, once registered, cannot be defeated even by adverse, open and
notorious possession.  The certificate
of title issued is an absolute and indefeasible evidence of ownership of the
property in favor of the person whose name appears therein.  It is binding and conclusive upon the whole
world.
[7]

All persons must take notice and no one can plead ignorance of the
registration.
[8]


Neither can the tax declarations and tax receipts presented by
petitioners as evidence of ownership prevail over respondentsâ certificate of
title which, to reiterate, is an incontrovertible proof of ownership.  It should be stressed that tax declarations
and receipts do not by themselves conclusively prove title to the land.
[9]

They only constitute positive and strong indication that the taxpayer concerned
has made a claim either to the title or to the possession of the property for
which taxes have been paid.
[10]

Stated differently, tax declarations and tax receipts are only 
prima facie
 evidence of ownership
or possession.  


But assuming 
ex gratia argumenti
  that petitioners had indeed acquired the land they were claiming
by prescription, there likewise exists a serious doubt on the precise identity
of the disputed property.  What
petitioners claimed in their complaint was a parcel of land located in
Cambansag, San Isidro, Bohol, with an area of 3,625 square meters.
[11]

This clearly differs from the piece of land registered in the name of the
Gepalagos, which is Lot No. A-73 of the Subdivision Plan (LRC) Psd-60558, LRC
Rec. No. H-4251, and located in Candungao Calapo, San Isidro, Bohol, with an
area of 5,970 square meters.
[12]

Even the commissionerâs report failed to clarify the difference in the area and
location of the property claimed.  In
order that an action to recover ownership of real property may prosper, the
person who claims that he has a better right to it must prove not only his
ownership  of  the  same but also
satisfactorily prove the identity thereof.
[13]


As a general rule, where the certificate of title is in the name
of the vendor when the land is sold, the vendee for value has the right to rely
on what appears on the face of the title.
[14]

He is under no obligation to look beyond the certificate and investigate the
title of the vendor appearing on the face of the certificate.  By way of exception, the vendee is required
to make the necessary inquiries if there is anything in the certificate of
title which indicates any cloud or vice in the ownership of the property.
[15]

Otherwise, his mere refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful
closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his
vendorâs title, will not make him an innocent purchaser for value if it
afterwards develops that the title was in fact defective, and it appears that
he had such notice of the defect as would have led to its discovery had he
acted with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a
prudent man in a like situation.
[16]


Petitioners maintain that it is the exception, not the general
rule, which should be applied in this case.  They argue that respondents had knowledge of prior possession and
enjoyment by petitioners when they purchased the property.  Thus, they were not innocent purchasers for
value and could not invoke the indefeasibility of their title. 


We do not agree.  The
exception contemplates a situation  wherein there exists a 
flaw  
in
the title of the vendor and the vendee has knowledge or at least ought to have
known of such flaw at the time he acquired the property, in which case, he is
not considered as an innocent purchaser for value.  In the instant case, we discern nothing from the records showing
that the title of PNB, the vendor, was flawed. Petitioners not only failed to
substantiate their claim of acquisitive prescription as basis of ownership but
they also failed to allege, and much less adduce, any evidence that there was a
defect in the title of PNB.  In the
absence of such evidence, the presumption leans towards the validity of the vendorâs
title. 


Therefore, inasmuch as there was no flaw in the title of PNB,
private respondents rightly believed that they could and did acquire likewise a
flawless title.  Indeed, as a result of
the deed of conveyance between PNB and private respondents, there was
transmission of ownership and the latter stepped into the shoes of the former
hence entitled to all the defenses available to PNB, including those arising
from the acquisition of the property in good faith and for value.


Finally, another consideration that militates heavily against the
present petition is the unusual silence of petitioners while the ownership of
the disputed land transferred from one person to another.  There were at least three (3) transactions
on record involving the property:  
first
,
the contract of mortgage between Luspo and PNB whereby the property was used as
security for the loan contracted by Luspo; 
second
,  the foreclosure of mortgage upon the failure
of Luspo to pay the loan and the subsequent sale of the property at public
auction; and, 
third
,  the sale of
the property to fifty-six (56) vendees, among whom were the Gepalago spouses.  Each of these transactions was registered
and a corresponding transfer certificate issued in favor of the new owner.  Yet in all these, petitioners never
instituted any action contesting the same nor registered any objection thereto;
instead, they remained silent.  Thus,
they are now 
estopped
  from
denying the title of the present owner.  Having failed to assert their rights, if any, over the property warrants
the presumption that they have either abandoned them or declined to assert
them.  Or, it could likewise be
inferred therefrom that petitioners themselves were not convinced in the
validity of their claim.


WHEREFORE
,  the
petition is DENIED.  The Decision of
the Court of Appeals of 31 July 1995 as well as its Resolution of 14 December
1995 denying reconsideration is AFFIRMED.  Costs against petitioners.
