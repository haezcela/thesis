SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. Nos. 121995-96, April 20, 1998 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO
DACOBA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




MELO, J.:


An accusation for rape can be made
with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person
accused to disprove.  The evidence for
the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to
draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.


These doctrines become material
and pertinent in resolving the instant appeal from the October 27, 1994 Joint
Decision of the Regional Trial Court of the Fourth Judicial Region (Mauban,
Quezon, Branch 64) in Criminal Cases No. 1408 and 1409, finding
accused-appellant guilty of two counts of the crime of rape upon Jonalyn
Andaya.  Francisco Dacobaâs conviction
for said crime arose from two complaints both dated November 20, 1992, which
charged him with raping his then 13-year old sister-in-law on November 7 and
November 12, 1992.


Upon agreement of the prosecution
and the defense, a joint trial on the merits ensued, following which, a
judgment of conviction was rendered, disposing:


WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Francisco Dacoba
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed the crime of rape, defined
and punished under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, upon the person of
Jonalyn Andaya, on two (2) occasions, and therefore, sentences him to suffer
the penalty of 
reclusion
 
perpetua
 for each of the two (2)
offenses and the disqualifications attached thereto under the law and to
indemnify the offended party in the sum of 
P
60,000.00 and to pay the
costs.


SO ORDERED.


(pp. 31-32, 
Rollo
.)


The trial courtâs statement of the
background facts was quoted by the Office of Solicitor General, with the proper
references to the transcript of stenographic notes supplied.  The same being supported by the evidentiary
facts, we likewise adopt, to wit:


Complainant Jonalyn Andaya recounted that she was living
with her sister Ana and the latterâs husband, accused Francisco Dacoba, at
Barangay Sto. Angel, Mauban, Quezon.


On November 7, 1992, while her sister Ana was in town to
buy viand, the accused asked her to go with him to the mountain to gather
firewood (tsn, March 2, 1993, p. 13).  Upon reaching the mountain, the accused forced himself upon her and
inserted his penis in her private parts and succeeded having carnal knowledge
with the complainant.


On cross examination, complainant testified that prior to the
act of rape, accused boxed her below the right armpit.(
Ibid
., p. 30)


The second occasion occurred on November 12, 1992.  While complainant and accused were left in
the house at Barangay Sto. Angel, Mauban, Quezon, accused pulled her in a room,
undressed her and then placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis in
her private part.  Accused succeeded in
undressing complainant by punching her below the ribs which rendered
complainant weak and defenseless. (
Ibid
., pp. 14-15)


Thereafter, accused ordered the complainant to put on her
clothes and not to tell anyone otherwise he would kill her. (
Ibid.
)


Complainant reported the incident to her aunt, Josie
Andaya, after the second rape incident. (
Ibid
., pp. 15-16)


Prosecution witness Josie Andaya testified that on November
15, 1992, while she was in her store in the public market of Mauban, Quezon,
Jonalyn came to her crying.  When she
asked the complainant what happened, the latter told her that accused raped her
twice. (tsn, March 30, 1993, p. 40)


On the following day, November 16, 1992, she brought
Jonalyn Andaya to the Mauban District Hospital at Barangay Polo, Mauban,
Quezon, for physical examination where she was examined by Dr. Dante R.
Diamante, Jr.  Jonalyn Andaya related to
Dr. Diamante that she was âpinagsamantalahan.â (tsn, June 23, 1993, p. 3)


After examination, Jonalyn and Josie Andaya proceeded to
Barangay Lincutan, Mauban, Quezon, to see Jonalynâs father, Jose Andaya.  Josie Andaya told Jose Andaya the incident
that befell her daughter. (tsn, March 30, 1993, pp. 40-41)


The following morning, November 17, 1992, Jonalyn Andaya,
Jose Andaya and Josie Andaya went to the police headquarters and filed the
complaints charging Francisco Dacoba of the crime of rape.


(
Ibid
., pp.
41-42)


In defense, accused-appellant
pleads denial, insisting that he never committed the crime charged.


Ana Andaya-Dacoba, wife of
accused-appellant and sister of  complainant, tried to establish that on November 7, 1992, she was at
home weaving hats, while her husband was making sticks for nipa shingles and
complainant was attending to the coupleâs 10-month old child.  She then invited accused-appellant to go to
the mountain to gather pili nuts but since complainant wanted to go with them,
they all went to the mountain.  She claimed
that during such time, all of them were together and within sight of each other
(tsn, September 1, 1993, pp. 6-8).


In further defense of her husband,
Ana also claimed that on November 12, 1992, there was a flood and she and her
husband, together with complainant, removed rice stalks under their house.  After their chore, Ana said that she asked
complainant to go to town to buy food for lunch but the latter refused because
of the flood.  This angered
accused-appellant who told Ana to go instead and to pack complainantâs
belongings and to send her back to their father (
Ibid
., pp. 13-14).


Continuing, Ana narrated that she
and accused-appellant left the house, taking with them all of complainantâs
belongings.  Complainant was left behind
because she refused to go back to her father.  They delivered Jonalynâs belongings to her father and asked the latter
to fetch Jonalyn in their house in Sto. Angel (
Ibid
., pp. 14-19).


Ana further added that the reason
for the filing of the rape cases against her husband was for the purpose of
causing their separation because her family does not approve of
accused-appellant.  She also claimed
that her family was demanding 
P
50,000.00 from them (
Ibid
., pp.
24-25).


Accused-appellant echoed the testimony
of his wife that they, with their child, as well as complainant, were at home
on November 7, 1992, and that the four of them went to the mountain and
gathered pili nuts for four hours (tsn, August 17, 1994, pp. 25-26).


Likewise, accused-appellant claimed
that on November 12, 1992, he was in their house with his wife and complainant,
and that he and his wife went to see his father-in-law, Jose Andaya, and gave
him complainantâs clothes and belongings indicating they would like to return
complainant to her fatherâs care (
Ibid
., pp. 27-28).


In the instant appeal,
accused-appellant raises the sole assigned error that the prosecution failed to
prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.


We are not persuaded.


It is a well-settled doctrine that
in a prosecution for rape, the complainantâs credibility becomes the single
most important issue.  Thus, if her
testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the
basis thereof (
People vs. Gagto
, 253 SCRA 455 [1996]).


The trial court was convinced that
the testimony of the offended party was given with sincerity and candor as
revealed by complainantâs demeanor on the witness stand.  Her testimony, as found below,
unquestionably proves the act of rape on two occasions, when she candidly and
spontaneously declared:


Q.
    
You
were shown your affidavit which has been marked as Exh. âCâ and âC-1â for the
prosecution.  Do you remember having
been asked this question: âT:  Bakit ka
nagsadya dito sa Tanggapan ng Pulisya dito sa Mauban, Quezon?â  and you answered, âS:  Dahil ako po ay maghahabla.â


A.
    
Yes,
sir.


Q.
    
Do
you remember having been asked this question, âT:  Sino naman ang iyong ihahabla?â and have given this answer,
âS:  Ang bayaw ko po na si Francisco
Dacoba.â


A.
    
Yes,
sir.


Q.
    
Do
you remember having been asked this question, âT:  Bakit mo siya ihahabla?â and having given this answer, âS:  Ako po ay kanyang ginahasa.â


A.
    
Yes,
sir.


Q.
    
Do
you remember having been asked this question, âT: Ilang beses kang ginahasa ng
iyong bayaw? and having given this answer. âS:  Dalawang beses po ang una ay noong ika 7 ng Nobyembre 1992 humigit
kumulang sa ika 8:00 ng umaga at ang ikalawa po ay noong ika 12 ng Nobyembre
1992 humigit kumulang po sa ika 4:00 ng hapon?â


ATTY. RIVERA:


I object on the line of questioning of
the prosecutor.  He is impeaching his
own witness.


FISCAL  ALPAJORA:


I am just rectifying from the record.


COURT:


Witness may answer.


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


(Brief for the Appellee,
pp. 18-20)


The defense suggests that the
accusations of Jonalyn Andaya are mere concoctions purportedly to alienate her
sister, Ana, from accused-appellant or to extort 
P
50,000.00 from him.


The argument is shallow.


Not a few accused in rape cases
have attributed the charges brought against them to family feuds, resentment,
or revenge.  But such alleged motives
have never swayed the Court from lending full credence to the testimony of a
complainant who remained steadfast throughout her direct and cross-examination
(
People vs. Saballe
, 236 SCRA 365 [1994]), especially a minor as in the
case at bench.


It is quite unthinkable that
complainant would file a charge as serious as rape against her own
brother-in-law simply because her family does not approve of him as husband for
her sister.  Certainly, complainant, an
unmarried teenage lass, would not subject and expose herself to the humiliation
of a rape trial, with its attendant publicity and the morbid curiosity it will
arouse merely to force her sister to separate from accused-appellant.  Rather, only the compulsive motive to seek
justice could be strong enough for complainant to implicate her own
brother-in-law.


Time and again, this Court has
taken judicial notice of the fact that it is highly inconceivable for a young
barrio lass, inexperienced with the ways of the world, to fabricate a charge of
defloration, undergo a medical examination of her private parts, subject
herself to public trial, and tarnish her familyâs honor and reputation unless
she was motivated by a potent desire to seek justice for the wrong committed
against her (
People vs. Esguerra
, 256 SCRA 657 [1996]).


On this score, it is an accepted
precept that testimony of rape victims who are young and immature deserve full
credence (
People vs. Galimba
, 253 SCRA 722 [1996]).  Further, findings of the trial court anent
the credibility of witnesses are generally accorded the highest respect unless
there appears in the record â and there is none in this case â some fact or
circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the
significance of which has been misinterpreted. (
People vs. Obzunar
, 265
SCRA 547 [1996]; 
People vs. Lagrosa, Jr.
, 230 SCRA 298 [1994])


The fact that the victim was
sexually assaulted is patently established by the medical certificate later
confirmed on the witness stand, issued by Dr. Dante Diamante, Jr. who
physically examined the victim.  The
medical certificate clearly states that the victimâs vagina was lacerated and
there was hematoma adjacent to urethral meatus which could only be caused by
any hard object or any flesh part of the body which is hardened, like an erect
penis.


Finally, all that
accused-appellant could offer by way of defense are denial and alibi.  Well-entrenched is the rule that alibi and
denial are inherently weak and have always been viewed with disfavor by the
courts due to the facility with which they can be concocted (
People vs.
Danao
, 253 SCRA 146 [1996]).  They
warrant the least credibility or none at all (
People vs. Paragua
, 257
SCRA 118 [1996]) and cannot prevail over the positive identification of the
accused by the prosecution witnesses (
People vs. Pano
, 257 SCRA 274
[1996]; 
People vs. Panlilio
, 255 SCRA 503 [1996]).


We thus agree with the trial court
that the evidence for the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt
the guilt of  accused-appellant for the
crime charged.

, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED 
in
