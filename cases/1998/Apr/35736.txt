THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. HON.
OSCAR B. PIMENTEL, AS JUDGE, RTC OF MAKATI, METRO MANILA, BRANCH 148 AND
ANTONIO A. TUJAN, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


Is the Court of Appeals, in affirming the order of the Regional
Trial Court, correct in ruling that Subversion is the â
main 
offenseâ in
a charge of 
Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of
Subversion 
under P.D. No. 1866, as amended, and that, therefore, the said
charge should be quashed in view of a previous charge of 
Subversion 
under
R.A. No. 1700, as amended by P.D. No. 885, against the same accused pending in
another court?


Stated differently, is the accused charged with the 
same 
offense
in both cases, which would justify the dismissal of the second charge on the
ground of double jeopardy?


This is the pith issue presented before us in this appeal by 
certiorari

interposed by the People under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, seeking a
review of the decision
[1]

of the Court of Appeals (Sixteenth Division) dated May 27, 1991, in CA-G.R. SP
No. 24273, entitled âTHE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, Petitioner, versus HON.
OSCAR B. PIMENTEL, as Judge, RTC of Makati, Metro Manila, Branch 148 and
ANTONIO A. TUJAN, Respondents.â


The record discloses the following antecedent facts:


As early as 1983, private respondent Antonio Tujan was charged with
Subversion under Republic Act No. 1700 (the Anti-Subversion Law), as amended,
before the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45), National Capital Region,
docketed as Criminal Case No. 64079.
[2]

As a consequence thereof, a warrant for his arrest was issued on July 29, 1983,
[3]

but it remained unserved as he could not be found.


Almost seven (7) years thereafter,
or on June 5, 1990, Antonio Tujan was arrested on the basis of the warrant of
arrest in the subversion case.
[4]
 When arrested, an unlicensed .38 caliber special
revolver and six (6) rounds of live ammunition were found in his possession.
[5]


Consequently, on June 14, 1990, Antonio Tujan was charged with
Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion under
Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, before the Regional Trial Court of
Makati (Branch 148), docketed as Criminal Case No. 1789.  The Information reads: 


â
That on or about the 5
th
 day of June, 1990, in the Municipality of ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila,
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, being a member of a communist party of the Philippines,
and its front organization, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously have in his possession, control and custody, in furtherance of or
incident to, or in connection with the crime of subversion, a special edition
ARMSCOR PHILS. caliber .38 special revolver with Serial No. 1026387 and with
six (6) live ammunitions, without first securing the necessary license or
permit thereof from competent government authority.â
[6]


The above Information recommended no bail for Antonio Tujan, which
recommendation was approved by the trial court in an Order dated June 19, 1990.
[7]

The same order also directed the continued detention of Antonio Tujan at MIG 15
of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP),
Bago Bantay, Quezon City, while his case is  pending.


On June 26, 1990, Antonio Tujan, through counsel, filed a motion
[8]

invoking his right to a preliminary investigation pursuant to Section 7, Rule
112 of the Revised Rules of Court and praying that his arraignment be held in
abeyance until the preliminary investigation is terminated.


However, on June 27, 1990, during the hearing of Antonio Tujanâs
motion for preliminary investigation, his counsel withdrew the motion since he
would file a motion to quash the Information, for which reason counsel
requested a period of twenty (20) days to do so.  This was granted by the trial court on that same day.
[9]


On July 16, 1990, Antonio Tujan did file the motion to quash
[10]

the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789  on the ground that he âhas been previously in jeopardy of being
convicted of the offense chargedâ in Criminal Case No. 64079 (for subversion)
of the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch 45).  The said ground is based on Sections 3 (h) and 7, Rule 117 of the
1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure.  In
support of the motion, Antonio Tujan contends that âcommon crimes such as
illegal possession of firearms and ammunition should actually be deemed
absorbed in subversion,â
[11]

citing the cases of 
Misolas vs. Panga, et al
. (G. R. No. 83341, January
30, 1990, 181 SCRA 648) and 
Enrile vs. Salazar, et al.
 (G. R. No. 92163,
June 5, 1990, 186 SCRA 217).  Antonio
Tujan then avers that âthe present case is the twin prosecutionâ of âthe
earlier subversion caseâ and, therefore, he âis entitled to invoke the
constitutional protection against double jeopardy.â
[12]


The petitioner opposed
[13]

the motion to quash, arguing that Antonio Tujan does not stand in jeopardy of
being convicted a second time because: (a) he has not even been arraigned in
the subversion case, and (b) the offense charged against him in Criminal Case
No. 64079 is for Subversion, punishable under Republic Act No. 1700; while the
present case is for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance
of  Subversion, punishable under a different
law (Presidential Decree No. 1866).  Moreover, petitioner contends that Antonio Tujanâs reliance on the 
Misolas

and
 Enrile
 cases âis misplaced.â
[14]

Tujan merely relies on the dissenting opinions  in  the 
Misolas 
  case.  Also, the 
Enrile
 case which involved a complex crime of rebellion
with murder is inapplicable to the instant case which is not a complex
offense.  Thus, the âabsorption ruleâ as
held applicable in the 
Enrile
 ruling âhas no room for application in the
present case because (illegal) possession of firearm and ammunition is not a
necessary means of committing the offense of subversion, nor is subversion a
necessary means of committing the crime of illegal possession of firearm and
ammunition.â
[15]


The trial court, in an order dated October 12, 1990, granted the
motion to quash the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789, the dispositive
portion of the order reading:


âWHEREFORE, the motion to quash the information is hereby
GRANTED, but only in so far as the accused may be placed in jeopardy or in
danger of being convicted or acquitted of the crime of Subversion and as a
consequence the Information is hereby quashed and the case dismissed without
prejudice to the filing of Illegal Possession of Firearm.


âSO ORDERED.â
[16]


It is best to quote the disquisition of the respondent court in
quashing the information and dismissing the case:


âx x x
       
x x x
         
       
x x x


âIn other words, 
the main offense the accused is being charged
in this case is also Subversion considering that the alleged Illegal Possession
of the Firearm and Ammunition is only in furtherance thereof.


âNow, subversion being a continuing offense as has been previously
held by the Supreme Court, the fact that the accused has been previously
charged of Subversion before another court before the institution of this
instant case is just a continuing offense of his former charge or that his acts
constituting subversion is a continuation of the acts he committed before.


âThe court therefore cannot subscribe to the position taken by the
prosecution that this case is very different from the other case and that
double jeopardy will attach in this particular case.


âThis court agrees with the position taken by the defense that
double jeopardy will attach to the accusation of subversion, punishable now under
Republic Act 1700, as Rule 117 of the Rules of Court particularly Section 1
thereof, provides:


âTime to move to quash-  At
any time before entering his plea, the accused may move to quash the complaint
or information.(1a)â


âIn other words, there is no necessity that the accused should be
arraigned first before he can move to quash the information.  It is before he pleads which the accused did
in this case.


âOn the other submissions by the prosecution, that the possession
of firearms and ammunitions is not a necessary means of committing the offense
of subversion or vice versa, then if the court follows such argument, there
could be no offense of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in
furtherance of Subversion, for even the prosecution admits also that in
subversion which is an offense involving propaganda, counter propaganda, a
battle of the hearts and mind of the people does not need the possession or use
of firearms and ammunitions.


âThe prosecution even admits and to quote:


âThe defense of double jeopardy, while unquestionably available to
the accused, had not been clearly shown to be invokable(sic) at this point in
time.â


âBut the rule says otherwise as previously stated as provided for
under Section 1 of Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.


â
Thus, if ever the accused is caught in possession of a firearm
and ammunition which is separate and distinct from the crime of subversion and
is not a necessary ingredient thereof and the court believed so, the
prosecution will have to file another information as they may wish.  The court therefore has to grant the motion
to quash on the aforestated grounds, subject to Section 5 of Rule 117,
considering that the only offense to which the accused in this case may be placed
in jeopardy is Subversion and not Illegal Possession of Firearms and
Ammunitions
.


âThe prosecution may file any
information as warranted within ten (10) days from receipt of this order
otherwise the court will order the release of the accused, unless he is in
custody for some other offense.â
[17]
 (Emphasis ours)


Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration
[18]

was also denied in an order dated December 28, 1990.
[19]


The petitioner elevated the case to the Court of Appeals through
a petition for 
certiorari
, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 24273.  However, the appellate court found that the
trial court did not commit any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction in quashing the questioned Information.  In dismissing the petition, the appellate court,
in its decision dated May 27, 1991, basically reiterated the aforequoted ruling
of the trial court.


Petitioner now comes to this Court, claiming that: (1) the
decision of the Court of Appeals is not in accord with the law and applicable
jurisprudence; and (2) it was deprived of due process to prosecute and prove
its case against private respondent Antonio Tujan in Criminal Case No. 1789.


We agree with the petitioner. 


The Court of Appeals considered as duplicitous the Information
for violation of  P.D. No. 1866 filed
against private respondent Antonio Tujan.  It ruled:  


âThe foregoing information (for
Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion)
filed before the Makati court shows that the main case is subversion
considering that there is an allegation that the alleged illegal possession of
firearms was made âin furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the
crime of subversion.â  Also, the
information alleged likewise that the accused is a member of a communist party
of the Philippines and its front organization.  Basically, the information refers to the crime of Subversion qualified
by Illegal Possession of Firearms.  x x
x.â
[20]


The ruling of the Court of Appeals is erroneous.


Section 1 of  Presidential
Decree No. 1866, under which Antonio Tujan is charged in Criminal Case No. 1789
before the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch 148), provides as follows:


âSection 1.  
Unlawful

Manufacture, Sales, Acquisition, Disposition or 
Possession of Firearms or
Ammunition
 or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of
Firearms or Ammunition. 
â The penalty of 
reclusion temporal 
in its
maximum period to 
reclusion perpetua 
shall be imposed upon 
any person
who shall unlawfully
 manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or 
possess
any firearms, part of firearm, ammunition
, or machinery, tool or instrument
used or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition.


âIf homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed
firearms, the penalty of death shall be imposed.


â
If the violation of this Section is in furtherance of, or
incident to, or in connection with the crimes of rebellion, insurrection or
subversion, the penalty of death shall be imposed
.


âThe penalty of 
reclusion temporal 
in its maximum period to 
reclusion
perpetua
 shall be imposed upon the owner, president, manager, director or
other responsible officer of any public or private firm, company, corporation
or entity, who shall willfully or knowingly allow any of the firearms owned by
such firm, company, corporation or entity to be used by any person or persons
found guilty of violating the provisions of the preceding paragraphs.


âThe penalty of 
prision mayor 
shall be imposed upon any
person who shall carry any licensed firearm outside his residence without legal
authority therefor.â (Emphasis ours)


The above-quoted provisions of  P.D. No. 1866 are plain and simple.  Under the first paragraph of Section 1, the 
mere possession 
of an

unlicensed firearm or ammunition
 is 
the crime itself
 which
carries the penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its maximum period to 
reclusion
perpetua
.  The third paragraph of
the same Section makes the 
use
 of said firearm and ammunition âin
furtherance of, or incident to, or in connection with the crimes of rebellion,
insurrection or subversionâ a circumstance to 
increase
 the 
penalty

to death. Thus, the allegation in the Information in Criminal Case No. 1789
that the unlicensed firearm found in the possession of Antonio Tujan, âa member
of the communist party of the Philippines and its front organization,â was used
âin furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of
subversionâ 
does not charge him with the separate and distinct crime of
Subversion in the same Information, but simply describes the mode or manner by
which the violation of Section 1 of  P.D. No. 1866 was committed
[21]

so as to qualify the penalty to death.
 


There is, therefore, only 
one 
offense charged in the
questioned information, that is, 
the illegal possession of firearm and
ammunition
, qualified by its being used in furtherance of subversion.
[22]

There is nothing in P.D. No. 1866, specifically Section 1 thereof, which
decrees categorically or by implication that the crimes of rebellion,
insurrection or subversion are the very acts that are being penalized.  This is clear from the title of the law
itself which boldly indicates the specific acts penalized under it:


âCODIFYING THE LAWS ON

ILLEGAL/UNLAWFUL POSSESSION
, 
MANUFACTURE
, 
DEALING IN
, 
ACQUISITION

OR 
DISPOSITION
, OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVES OR INSTRUMENTS
USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVES, AND 
IMPOSING
STIFFER PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS THEREOF
 AND FOR RELEVANT
PURPOSES.â (Emphasis ours)


On the other hand, the previous subversion charge against Antonio
Tujan in Criminal Case No. 64079, before the Regional Trial Court of Manila
(Branch 45), is based on a different law, that is, Republic Act No. 1700, as
amended.  Section 3 thereof penalizes
any person who âknowingly, wilfully and by overt act affiliates with, becomes
or remains a member of a subversive association or organization x x x.â  Section 4 of said law further penalizes
âsuch member [of the Communist Party of the Philippines and/or its successor or
of any subversive association] (who) takes up arms against the
Government.â  Thus, in the present case,
private respondent Antonio Tujan could be charged either under P.D. No. 1866 or
R.A. No. 1700,
[23]

or both.


This leads us to the issue of whether or not private respondent
Antonio Tujan was placed in double jeopardy with the filing of the second
Information for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of
Subversion.  


We rule in the negative.


Article III of the Constitution provides:


âSec. 21.  No person shall
be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the 
same
 
offense
.  If an act is punished by a law and an
ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to
another prosecution for the same act.â (Emphasis ours)


Complementing the above constitutional provision, Rule 117 of the
Revised Rules of Court states:


âSEC. 7.  
Former
conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy. 
â When an accused has been
convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise
terminated without his express consent by a court of competent jurisdiction,
upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form
and substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the
charge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case
shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any
attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which
necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the
former complaint or information.


x x x
       
x x x
         
       
x
x x.â


The right of an accused against double jeopardy is a matter which
he may raise in a motion to quash to defeat a subsequent prosecution for the 
same

offense.  The pertinent provision of
Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court provides:


âSEC. 3.  
Grounds.
 â
The accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the
following grounds:


x x x 
       
x
x x
       
x x x


(h) That the accused has been 
previously convicted
 or 
in
jeopardy of being convicted
, or 
acquitted
 of the offense charged.
(2a)â (Emphasis ours)


In order that the protection against double jeopardy may inure to
the benefit of an accused, the following requisites must have obtained in the 
first

criminal action: (a) a valid complaint or information; (b) a competent court;
(c) the defendant had pleaded to the charge;
[24]

and (d) the defendant was acquitted, or convicted, or the case against him was
dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent.
[25]


Suffice it to say that in the present case, private respondentâs
motion to quash filed in the trial court did not actually raise the issue of
double jeopardy simply because it had not arisen yet.  It is noteworthy that the private respondent has not even been
arraigned in the first criminal action for subversion.  Besides, as earlier discussed, the two
criminal charges against private respondent are not of the 
same 
offense
as required by Section 21, Article III of the Constitution.


It is clear from the foregoing, that the assailed decision of the
Court of Appeals is not in accordance with the law and jurisprudence and thus
should be reversed.


While we hold that both the subversion charge under R.A. No.
1700, as amended, and the one for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition
in furtherance of subversion under P.D. No. 1866, as amended, can co-exist, the

subsequent
 enactment of Republic Act No. 7636 on September 22, 1992, 
totally


repealing
 R.A. No. 1700, as amended, has substantially changed the
complexion of the present case, inasmuch as the said repealing law being
favorable to the accused-private respondent, who is not a habitual delinquent,
should be given retroactive effect.
[26]


Although this legal effect of R.A. No. 7636 on
private-respondentâs case has never been raised as an issue by the parties â
obviously because the said law came out only several months after the
questioned decision of the Court of Appeals was promulgated and while the
present petition is pending with this Court â we should nonetheless fulfill our
duty as a court of justice by applying the law to whomsoever is benefited by it
regardless of whether or not the accused or any party has sought the
application of the beneficent provisions of the repealing law.
[27]


That R.A. No. 7636 should apply retroactively to accused-private
respondent is beyond question.  The
repeal by said law of R.A. No. 1700, as amended, was categorical, definite and
absolute.  There was no saving clause in
the repeal.  The legislative intent of
totally abrogating the old anti-subversion law is clear.  Thus, it would be illogical for the trial
courts to try and sentence the accused-private respondent for an offense that
no longer exists.
[28]


As early as 1935, we ruled in 
People vs. Tamayo
:
[29]


âThere is no question that at common law and in America a much more
favorable attitude towards the accused exists relative to statutes that have
been repealed than has been adopted here.  Our rule is more in conformity with the Spanish doctrine, but even in
Spain, 
where the offense ceases to be criminal, prosecution cannot be had
.
(1 Pacheco Commentaries, 296)â (Emphasis ours)


Where, as here, the repeal of a penal law is total and absolute
and the act which was penalized by a prior law ceases to be criminal under the
new law, the previous offense is obliterated.
[30]

It is a recognized rule in this jurisdiction that a total repeal deprives the
courts of jurisdiction to try, convict and sentence persons charged with
violation of the old law prior to the repeal.
[31]


With the enactment of R.A. No. 7636, the charge of subversion
against the accused-private respondent has no more legal basis and should be
dismissed.  


As regards the other charge of illegal possession of firearm and
ammunition, qualified by subversion, this charge should be amended to simple
illegal possession of firearm and ammunition since, as earlier discussed,
subversion is no longer a crime.  


Moreover, the offense of simple illegal possession of firearm and
ammunition is now bailable under Republic Act No. 8294 which was enacted on
June 6, 1997.  R.A. No. 8294 has amended
Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, by eliminating the provision in said
P.D. that if the unlicensed firearm is used in furtherance of subversion, the
penalty of death shall be imposed.
[32]

Under the new law (R.A. No. 8294), the penalty prescribed for simple illegal
possession of firearm (.38 caliber) is now reduced to 
prision correccional 
in
its maximum period and a fine of not less than Fifteen thousand pesos (
P
15,000.00).
[33]

The reduced penalty of imprisonment - which is four (4) years, two (2) months
and one (1) day to six (6) years - entitles the accused-private respondent to
bail.  Considering, however, that the
accused-private respondent has been detained since his arrest on June 5, 1990
up to the present (as far as our record has shown), or more than seven (7)
years now, his immediate release is in order.  This is so because even if he were convicted for illegal possession of
firearm and ammunition, the length of his detention while his case is pending
has already exceeded the penalty prescribed by the new law.


WHEREFORE
, the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals
dated May 27, 1991, in CA-G.R. SP No. 24273, including the orders dated October
12, 1990 and December 28, 1990 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch
148), National Capital Region, in Criminal Case No. 1789, are hereby REVERSED
and SET ASIDE.

A. Tujan in Criminal Case No. 64079 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila,
Branch 45, is hereby DISMISSED.

in furtherance of subversion against the same accused in Criminal Case No. 1789
of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 148, is DEEMED AMENDED to 
Simple
Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition
.  The accused-appellant is hereby ordered RELEASED IMMEDIATELY from
detention for the reason stated above, unless he is being detained for any
other offense.


This decision is IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY.
