KAPUNAN, J.:


In Criminal Case
No. 8251 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 2, City of Tagbilaran, Bohol,
Ernesto Auxtero, alias Toytoy was charged with rape under an information which
reads:


That on or about the 28
TH

day of November 1992, in the municipality of Talibon, province of Bohol,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, by means of force, threat and intimidation, with lewd
design and against the will and without the consent of the offended party, did
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of
one Ruth Tutor, a 14-year old girl; to the damage and prejudice of the said
Ruth Tutor.


Acts committed contrary to
the provisions of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act
No. 2632 and 4111.
[1]


The accused
entered the plea of not guilty of the offense charged when arraigned on 9 June
1993.
[2]
 After trial, the court 
a quo

rendered judgment on 2 September 1994, the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE, the Court finds
the accused ERNESTO AUXTERO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
Rape, defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as
amended. There being neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances, the
accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
,
to indemnify the offended party Ruth Tutor the sum of Fifty Thousand (
P
50,000.00)
Pesos without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the
costs.


SO ORDERED.
[3]


Hence, this
appeal from the lower courtâs decision with the following assignment of errors:


I


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN
GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINANT RUTH TUTOR WHOSE
TESTIMONY IS TAINTED WITH DOUBTS AND CONTRADICTIONS.


II


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN
NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT ON THE GROUND THAT RAPED (sic) WAS NOT
COMMITTED.
[4]


The facts as
established by the evidence for the prosecution are as follows:


Private complainant, Ruth Tutor, at
the time of the incident complained of, was a 14 year old freshman at Blessed
Trinity High School, Bohol.
[5]
 Accused-appellant Ernesto
Auxtero alias Toytoy was a tricycle driver plying his trade in Talibon, Bohol.


On 28 November 1992, the day of the
alleged rape, Ruth was on her way home from school where she had just finished
her drum and bugle corps practice.  She
rode on the tricycle of the accused Auxtero, to bring her home in Barangay San
Jose, which was approximately a kilometer away.  Auxtero was known to her as she had riden on his tricycle
before.  She seated herself at the back
of the motorcycle.  Seated in the side
car, was another passenger, an old woman who was drunk.
[6]


Upon reaching her house, Ruth asked
the accused to stop.  However, to her
stupefaction, instead of stopping, the accused increased his speed.  Ruth cried out for help but no one
responded.
[7]


At Barangay Balintawak, the old
woman alighted.  At this time, the
accused held Ruth's hand to prevent her from escaping.  The accused then transferred her to the side
car and drove towards Barangay San Carlos.  While driving, the accused kept on holding Ruth with his right hand.
[8]


When they reached Garcia Park, the
accused carried Ruth up a hill.  All
this time, Ruth was shouting for help, but the park was secluded.  The accused then kneeled on the thighs of
Ruth.  He removed his pants and Ruth's
underwear.  He then tried to insert his
penis into her vagina.  All the while,
she kept struggling to free herself.  Thereafter, she felt his penis penetrate her vagina which caused her
much pain.  This continued for about
thirty minutes.
[9]


Afterwards, the accused invited
Ruth to smoke.  She refused.  Instead, she tried to run away in the
dark.  After traversing a distance of
approximately fifty meters, the accused caught up with her and offered her a
ride home with a warning that should she recount the incident to her mother, he
would kill her.   She agreed to ride with
him as it was already dark and she did not know her way home.
[10]


She arrived home at around 7:30
p.m.  Upon disembarking from the
tricycle, Ruth immediately shouted to her parents to catch Auxtero who then
sped away.  Ruth narrated to her parents
her harrowing experience.  At this
point, Ruth noticed that her black Seiko wristwatch was missing and her belt
buckle was broken.
[11]


Ruth's parents then accompanied
their daughter for medical examination to Garcia Memorial Hospital.  From the hospital, they then proceeded to
the Talibon police station to report the incident.
[12]


The following morning, the Talibon
police, including prosecution witness SPO3 Desiderio Garcia, went to Barangay
San Jose to arrest the accused.  Together with the accused, they then proceeded to Garcia Park.  At the spot pointed to by Ruth where she was
raped, they observed the bushes were in disarray.  There they found the black Seiko wristwatch belonging to the
complainant.
[13]


The medical
Examination conducted by Fatima L. Buhay revealed that:


x x x RUTH TUTOR, 14 years
of age, female, single of San Jose, Talibon, Bohol, has been examined this 28th
day November 1992 at 9:25 p.m. and found to have sustained the following:


Findings:


=  Introitus abrasion
lateral to vaginal opening both sides with no bleeding points.


=  Hymen intact.


=  Admits tip of small finger with pain.


=  Discharges mecoid (sic), scanty


=  Test for presence of spermatozoa = negative
[14]


For his defense,
appellant denied the charges of rape against him.  While he admitted that the complainant was his passenger in the
late afternoon of 28 November 1992, he asserted that Ruth insisted on staying
on board the tricycle even after they had passed the latter's home.
[15]
 
This fact was corroborated by witness Consorcio
Questo, who claimed to be a passenger in the said trip.
[16]


Further,
appellant disclosed that he knew Ruth even before the alleged rape as the girl
was his passenger on different occasions.
[17]
 
He, however, did not like her as a passenger as at
times, she would not pay her fare and simply gets off the tricycle.


Another defense
witness Primiliano Cutura, a fellow tricycle driver of the accused, testified
that around 7:00 p.m. of the 28th of November 1992, he chanced upon the accused
and Ruth at the junction of Garcia Park.  The accused was at that time fixing a flat tire, and he (Cutura) offered
Ruth a ride home.  She, however,
declined.
[18]


There are three
settled principles to guide an appellate court in reviewing evidence in rape
cases:


1.  An accusation for rape can be made with
facility; it is difficult for the person of the accused, though innocent to
disprove it.


2.  In view of the intrinsic nature of the crime
of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the victim
must be scrutinized with extreme caution.


3.  The evidence for the prosecution must stand
or fall on its merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness
of the evidence for the defense.
[19]


On the basis of
the aforementioned guidelines, this Court will decide the merits of the
appellant's assignment of errors of the lower court's decision.


Settled is the
rule that the findings of the judge who tried the case and heard the witnesses
are not to be disturbed on appeal, unless there are substantial facts and
circumstances which have been overlooked and which, if properly considered,
might affect the result of the case.  This is due to the fact that the trial judge had the opportunity to
observe the witnesses firsthand and note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude
under grilling examination.
[20]


The lower court
relied heavily on the testimony of the victim.  It found that the testimony of the offended party was straightforward
and candid, unshaken even after a grilling cross-examination.
[21]


The appellant
asserts that the victim's testimony was tainted with doubts and contradictions
and there was no clear and convincing proof upon which conviction could be
based.  Thus, appellant argues that
while the complainant testified that her vagina was penetrated because she felt
pain, there was no medico-legal certificate presented or offered in evidence in
court to support complainant's testimony that her vagina was penetrated.  Further, complainant's testimony in open
court was contradicted by her sworn statement where she stated that the penis
of the accused never penetrated her vagina since the hands of the accused were
holding her and she kept on moving and trying to pull away.


We
disagree.  It is a well-settled rule
that a medical report is not even necessary in a prosecution for rape, as long
as the evidence on hand convinces the court that conviction is proper.
[22]
 
Surprisingly, it was the defense who presented the
medical report which, sadly for the defense, has the effect of affirming the
existence of rape rather than negating it.  The medical report shows lacerations by the vaginal opening; which
suffice to prove that there was penetration.  The fact that the hymen was still intact does not negate the existence
of rape, because there can be rape even without rupture of the hymen.
[23]


Complainant
categorically testified that appellant had succeeded in satisfying his bestial
lust on her, thus:


Q
     
Since
you were not able to extricate from the hands of the accused, what did the
accused do if there was any?


A
     
He
removed his pants.


Q
     
Can
you recall what hand did he use in unbottoning (sic) his pants?


A
     
Right
hand.


Q
     
What
else did he do to you when he tried to unbotton (sic) his pants with his right
hand?


A
     
He
kneeled on my both ties (sic), and he removed my pants.


COURT:


Make it on
record that the witness is continuously shedding tears.

Q

this time what did the accused do, while your pants and your panties were
removed?


A
     
He
touched my breast.


Q
     
Which
breast are you referring to, miss witness.


A
     
Both
breast[s].


Q
     
What
else did he do to you, aside from fonding your both breast (sic)?

penis had it pushed through my vagina, and he kept on pushing it to my vagina.
(sic).


Q

he kept on pushing it, referring to the penis of the accused, what did you
feel?


A
     
Very
painful, that was the first time I feel (sic) the pain.


Q
     
You
are referring to what part of your body you exactly felt the paid (sic)?


A
     
My
vagina.
[24]


In positing that
the testimony of Ruth is doubtful and incredible, appellant points out that if
she shouted for help several times while being forcibly taken by him to
Barangay San Carlos where she was raped, it is strange that no one lifted a
finger to help her.  Since the events
took place at around 5:30 in the afternoon, there must have been many people in
the streets and tricycle drivers plying their trade.  It is, therefore, highly improbable that no one had heard her
shouting for help.  Likewise, the other
woman passenger of the tricycle could have helped her by seeking assistance
from other people.  Appellant concludes
that under the circumstances, complaint had several opportunities to escape,
but she did nothing in that direction.


Appellant's assertions
are  completely without merit and are
not based on facts but on mere speculations.


Ruth
narrated  that the tricycle was moving
very fast rate,
[25]
 and that the appellant was tightly
holding her hand;
[26]
 so it was not possible for her to
escape.  The old woman passenger could
not have helped complainant, not only because she was inebriated, she also
appeared weak and sleepy.
[27]
 The place where the old woman
alighted was a secluded area.
[28]
 Appellant never turned off the
engine of the motorcycle as the woman disembarked.  In fact, complainant tried to escape but was overpowered by
appellant.
[29]


The lower court
correctly gave credence to the victim's testimony not only because it was
convincing and straightforward but it was further buttressed by the testimony
of the victim's parents, the findings of the medico-legal report, and the
report of the police investigator.  It
bears stressing that the victim wasted no time in narrating to her parents the
incident the moment she reached their home.  Complainant and her parents immediately reported the matter to the
police.


It is
unbelievable that a young barrio lass would concoct a tale of defloration,
allow the examination of her private parts, and undergo the expense, trouble
and inconvenience, not to mention the trauma and scandal of a public trial,
unless she was in fact raped.  No young
and decent Filipina would publicly admit that she was ravished and her honor
tainted unless such was true, for it would be instinctive for her to protect
her honor and obtain justice for the wicked acts committed upon her.
[30]


On the other
hand, the lower court noted that the appelant's declarations in court tend to
be evasive even on simple matters.  The
accused likewise admitted that he was with the complainant at about 7:00 o'clock
of November 28, 1992 at the junction of Garcia Park - a few meters from the
scene of the crime.  And that the only
witnesses he presented were related to him by consanguinity or affinity.


Thus, this Court
has no option but to declare that the lower court has rightfully reached its
decision that the prosecution has met the exacting test of moral certainty and
proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.


WHEREFORE
, the judgment of the trial court
dated September 2, 1994, finding the accused ERNESTO AUXTERO guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
RECLUSION


PERPETUA

Thousand (

insolvency, and to pay the cost, is hereby AFFIRMED
