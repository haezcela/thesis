THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 122955, April 15, 1998 ]


ST. THERESAâS SCHOOL OF
NOVALICHES FOUNDATION AND ADORACION ROXAS, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL
LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ESTHER REYES, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PURISIMA, J.:


Justitia
 
nemini neganda est
.  
Justice
is to be denied to none.  The law, while
protecting the rights of the employees, authorizes neither the oppression nor
destruction of the employer.
[1]
 When the law angles the scale of
justice in favor of labor, the scale should never be so tilted if the result is
an injustice to the employer.
[2]


The petition at bench seeks to modify the Resolution issued
on November 29, 1994 by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and its
Decision of 29 November, 1995 in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-6078-94. 


Petitioners contend that the public respondent acted with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in
handing down its disposition wherein, notwithstanding the finding that the
dismissal of private respondent was valid, it awarded backwages for the latter,
computed from November 12, 1993 up to the time of rendition of the decision
under attack.


Undisputed are the following facts:


Petitioner
Adoracion Roxas is the president of St. Theresaâs School of Novaliches Foundation.  She hired private respondent, Esther Reyes,
on a contract basis, for  the period
from June 1, 1991 to March 31, 1992.  However, private respondent commenced work on May 2, 1991.  During the said period of employment,
private respondent became ill.   She went
on a leave of absence from February 17 to 21 and from February 24 to 28, 1992,
such leave of absence having been duly approved by petitioner Roxas.  On March 2, 1992, private respondent
reported for work, but she only stayed in her place of work from 6:48 to 9:38
a.m.  Thereafter,  she never returned.  For what reason did private respondent stop
working?


Petitioners
theorize that the private respondent abandoned her work.  On the other hand, the latter maintains that
she was replaced.  When she went back to
work on February 20, 1992, she found out that her table, chair, and other
belongings were moved to a  corner of
their office, and she was replaced by Annie Roxas, daughter of petitioner
Adoracion Roxas.  She tried to
contact  her employer but the latter
could not be found within the school premises.


On
March 25, 1992, petitioners sent private respondent a letter by registered
mail, informing her that her contract, due to expire on March 31, 1992, would
not be renewed.  Prior thereto, or on
March 3, 1992, to be precise, the private respondent instituted NLRC NCR Case
No. 00-03-01481-92
[3]
 against the herein petitioners for 
âunfair labor
practice based on harassment, illegal dismissal, 13
th
 month pay, allowances, removal of desk and chair
form place of work, and refusal to communicate, moral and exemplary damages.â
[4]
 On November 12, 1993, absent any amicable settlement
hammered out by the parties, the Labor Arbiter came out with a decision,
disposing, thus:


âWHEREFORE, responsive to the
foregoing, judgment is hereby ordered declaring complainant (sic) dismissal
from the service illegal.  Respondent is
hereby ordered to reinstate complainant to her former position without loss of
seniority rights and to pay for full backwages from the time of dismissal to
her actual reinstatement in the amount of Seventy Six Thousand Seven Hundred
One (
P
76,701.00) Pesos.


Respondent is hereby ordered to
pay complainant 
P
25,000 as moral damages and 
P
10,000 by way of
exemplary damages.


Respondent (sic) are further
assessed attorneyâs fees of 10% of the award.â


On December 7, 1993, after posting
the necessary supersedeas bond, petitioners appealed the aforesaid decision to
the NLRC.


On January 12, 1994, private
respondent presented a Motion for Partial Execution of the reinstatement aspect
of the Labor Arbiterâs decision.


On April 5, 1994, when no action
was taken by the Labor Arbiter on her motion, she filed a Motion for Immediate
Resolution, and, on July 13, 1994, after three months, still without any action
taken by the same Labor Arbiter on her yearning, the private respondent sent in
a second Motion for Immediate Resolution. However, Labor Arbiter  Raul T. Aquino was appointed as Commissioner
of the NLRC, thereby leaving subject motions of private respondent unresolved.


On November 29, 1994, petitionersâ
appeal, docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 006078-94, was resolved in the assailed
Resolution of the of the Second Division of the NLRC; disposing, as follows:


âWHEREFORE, all premises
considered, the decision of the Labor Arbiter below dated November 12, 1993 is
hereby reversed and set aside and another one rendered, declaring the
separation of Esther Reyes from service legal and valid.


However, respondent is directed
to pay the backwages of herein complainant from November 12, 1993 up to the
date of  the promulgation of this
Resolution.â


Therefrom, both parties moved for
reconsideration; petitioners assailing the award of backwages in favor of
private respondent.


On November 29, 1995, the same
Second Division of NLRC rendered its challenged Decision, denying subject
motions for reconsideration.


Sometime in February 1996, the
private respondent filed with NLRC a Motion for Execution, through the deciding
Labor Arbiter.  But until now, no writ
of execution issued.  Unfortunately for private
respondent, she never interposed any appeal from NLRCâs ruling, upholding the
validity of her dismissal.  It is
therefore settled, beyond the reach of this courtâs power of review, that
private respondentâs employment was validly terminated.


On the part of
petitioners, they have come here to question the award of backwages for the
private respondent, whose dismissal has been upheld with finality. 


Before delving
into and passing upon the propriety of the assailed award of backwages, which
is the core of the Petition before us, the court takes note of the undisputed
fact that private respondent was employed on a contract basis. 


Article 280 of
the Labor Code does not proscribe or prohibit an employment contract with a
fixed period provided the same is entered into by the parties, without any
force, duress or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and
absent any other circumstance vitiating consent.  It does not necessarily follow  that where the duties of the employee consist of activities usually
necessary or desirable in the usual business of the employer, the parties are
forbidden from agreeing on a period of time for the performance of such
activities.  There is thus nothing
essentially contradictory between a definite period of employment and the
nature of the employeeâs duties.
[5]


It goes without
saying that contracts of employment govern the relationship of the
parties.  In this case, private
respondentâs contract provided for a fixed term of nine (9) months, from June 1,
1991 to March 31, 1992.  Such
stipulation, not being contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order and
public policy, is valid, binding and must be respected.
[6]


It bears
stressing that private teachers are subject to special rules with respect to requisites
for their permanent employment and security of tenure, to wit:


1. He must be a full time teacher;


2. He must have rendered at least
three consecutive years of service; and,


3. Such service must be
satisfactory.
[7]


This is in accord with the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools
issued by the then Department of Education.
[8]


We now tackle
the pivotal point of inquiry - the award of backwages in favor of private
respondent.  Is it proper in  light of the finding that her dismissal was
valid?


The term
âbackwagesâ has been defined as that for earnings lost by a worker due to his
illegal dismissal.
[9]
 Backwages are generally granted on
grounds of equity.
[10]
 Payment thereof is a form of relief
that restores the income lost by reason of such unlawful dismissal.
[11]
 It is not private compensation or
damages, but is awarded in furtherance and effectuation of the public
objectives of the Labor Code. Nor is it a redress of a private right but,
rather, in the nature of a command to the employer to make public reparation
for dismissing an employee, either due to the formerâs unlawful act or bad
faith.
[12]


Jurisprudence is
filled to the brim with cases wherein backwages were awarded to an employee illegally
dismissed.
[13]
 But where, as in this case of a
pitiful employee rendered hapless by her lawyerâs inaction or ignorance, the
dismissal has been adjudged valid and lawful, the challenged award of backwages
is decidedly  improper and contrary to
law and jurisprudence. 


WHEREFORE, 
the Petition is GRANTED; the
Decision of the respondent NLRC rendered on November 29, 1995 in NLRC NCR Case
No. 00-6078-94 is hereby MODIFIED by deleting therefrom the award of backwages
in question.  No pronouncement as to
costs.
