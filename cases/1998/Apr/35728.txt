[ G.R. No. 113097, April 27, 1998 ]


NASIPIT LUMBER COMPANY,
INC., AND PHILIPPINE WALLBOARD CORPORATION, PETITIONERS, VS.
NATIONAL WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION, WESTERN AGUSAN WORKERS UNION (WAWU-ULGWP
LOCAL 101), TUNGAO LUMBER WORKERS UNION (TULWU-ULGWP LOCAL 102) AND UNITED
WORKERS UNION (UWU-ULGWP LOCAL 103), RESPONDENTS.

PANGANIBAN, J.:


The Labor Code,
as amended by RA 6727 (the Wage Rationalization Act), grants the National Wages
and Productivity Commission (NWPC) the power to prescribe rules and guidelines
for the determination of appropriate wages in the country.  Hence, âguidelinesâ issued by the Regional
Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards (RTWPB) without the approval of or,
worse, contrary to those promulgated by the NWPC are ineffectual, void and
cannot be the source of rights and privileges.


The Case


This is the
principle used by the Court in resolving this petition for certiorari under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[1]
 dated March 8, 1993, promulgated by
the NWPC
[2]
 which disposed as follows:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
the Decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED.  The application for exemption of Anakan Lumber Company is hereby GRANTED
for a period of one (1) year retroactive to the date subject Wage Orders took
effect until November 21, 1991.  The
applications for exemption of Nasipit Lumber Company and Philippine Wallboard
Corporation are hereby DENIED for lack of merit, and as such, they are hereby
ordered to pay their covered workers the wage increases under subject Wage
Orders retroactive to the date of effectivity of said Wage Orders plus interest
of one percent (1%) per month.


SO ORDERED.â


Petitioners also
challenge the NWPCâs Decision
[3]
 dated November 17, 1993 which
denied their  motion for
reconsideration.


The RTWPBâs
August 1, 1991 Decision, which the NWPC modified, disposed as follows:


âWHEREFORE, all foregoing premises
considered, the instant petition for exemption from compliance with Wage Order
Nos. RX-01 and RX-01-A is hereby approved under and by virtue of criteria No.
2, Section 3 of RTWPB Guidelines No. 3 on Exemption, dated November 26, 1990,
for a period of only one (1) year, retroactive to the date said Wage Order took
effect up to November 21, 1991.


SO
ORDERED.â
[4]


The Facts


The undisputed
facts are narrated by the NWPC as follows:


âOn October 20, 1990, the Region X
[Tripartite Wages and Productivity] Board issued Wage Order No. RX-01 which
provides as follows:


âSection 1.  Upon the effectivity of this Wage Order, the
increase in minimum wage rates applicable to workers and employees in the
private sector in Northern Mindanao (Region X) shall be as follows:


a.
    
The
provinces of Agusan del Norte, Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, and the Cities of
Butuan, Gingoog, and Cagayan de Oro  - -
- - -
P
13.00/day


b.
    
The
provinces of Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte and Misamis Occidental, and the
Cities of Surigao Oroquieta, Ozamis and Tangub - - - - - 
P
11.00/day


c.
    
The
province of Camiguin 
P
9.00/dayâ


Subsequently, a supplementary Wage
Order No. RX-01-A was issued by the Board on November 6, 1990 which provides as
follows:


âSection 1.  Upon the effectivity of the original Wage
Order RX-01, all workers and employees in the private sector in Region X
already receiving wages above the statutory minimum wage rates up to one
hundred and twenty pesos (
P
120.00) per day shall also receive an
increase of 
P
13, 
P
11, 
P
9 per day, as provided for under
Wage Order No. RX-01;â


Applicants/appellees Nasipit Lumber
Company, Inc. (NALCO), Philippine Wallboard Corporation (PWC), and Anakan
Lumber Company (ALCO), claiming to be separate and distinct from each other but
for expediency and practical purposes, jointly filed an application for
exemption from the above-mentioned Wage Orders as distressed establishments
under Guidelines No. 3, issued by the herein Board on November 26, 1990,
specifically Sec. 3(2) thereof which, among others, provides:


âA.
  
For
purposes of this Guidelines the following criteria to determine whether the
applicant-firm is actually distressed shall be used.

Applicants/appellees aver that they
are engaged in logging and integrated wood processing industry but are distressed
due to conditions beyond their control, to wit:  1) Depressed economic conditions due to worldwide recession; 2)
Peace and order and other emergency-related problems causing disruption and
suspension of normal logging operations; 3) Imposition of environmental fee for
timber production in addition to regular forest charges; 4) Logging moratorium
in Bukidnon; 5) A reduction in the annual allowable volume of cut logs of NALCO
& ALCO by 59%; 6) Highly insufficient raw material supply; 7) Extraordinary
increases in the cost of fuel, oil, spare parts, and maintenance; 8) Excessive
labor cost/production ratio that is more or less 47%; and 9) Lumber export ban.


On the other hand,
oppositor/appellant Unions jointly opposed the application for exemption on the
ground that said companies are not distressed establishments since their
capitalization has not been impaired by 25%.â
[5]


Citing liquidity
problems and business decline in the wood-processing industry, the RTWPB
approved the applicantsâ joint application for exemption in this wise:


â1.
     
The
Board considered the arguments presented by petitioners and the
oppositors.  The Board likewise took
note of the financial condition of petitioner firms.  One of the affiliates, Anakan Lumber Company, is confirmed to be
suffering from capital impairment by:  14:80% in 1988, 71.35% in 1989 and 100% in 1990.  On the other hand, NALCO had a capital
impairment of 6.41%. 13.53% and 17.04% in 1988, 1989 and 1990, respectively,
while PWC had no capital impairment from 1988 to 1990.  However, the Board also took note of the
fact that petitioners are claiming for exemption, not on the strength of
capital impairment, but on the basis of belonging to a distressed industry - an
establishment that is engaged in an industry that is distressed due to
conditions beyond its control as may be determined by the Board in consultation
with DTI and NWPC.


2.
      
Inquiries
made by the Board from the BOI and the DTI confirm that all petitioner-firms
are encountering liquidity problems and extreme difficulty servicing their loan
obligations.


3.
      
A
perusal of the Provincial Trade and Industry Development Plan for Agusan del
Norte and Butuan City where petitioners are operating their business,  confirms the existence of a slump in the
wood-processing industry due to the growing scarcity of [a] large volume of raw
materials to feed the various plywood and lumber mills in the area.  A lot of firms have closed and shifted to
other ventures, the report continued, although the competitive ones are still
in operation.


4.
      
The Board took note of the fact that most
of the circumstances responsible for the financial straits of petitioners are
largely external, over which petitioners have very little control.  The Board feels that  as an alternative to closing up their
business[es] which could bring untold detriment and dislocation to [their]
4,000 workers and their families, petitioners should be extended assistance and
encouragement to continue operating - so that jobs could thereby be preserved
during these difficult times.  One such
way is for the Board to grant them a temporary reprieve from compliance with
the mandated wage increase specifically W.O. RX-01 and RX-01-A only.â
[6]


Dissatisfied
with the RTWPBâs Decision, the private respondents lodged an appeal with the
NWPC, which affirmed ALCOâs application but reversed the applications of herein
petitioners, NALCO and PWC.  The NWPC
reasoned:


âThe Guidelines No. 3 dated
November 26, 1990, issued by the herein Board cannot be used as valid basis for
granting applicants/appellees application for exemption since it did not pass
the approval of this Commission.


Under the Rules of Procedure on
Minimum Wage Fixing dated June 4, 1990, issued by this Commission pursuant to
Republic Act 6727, particularly Section 1 of Rule VIII thereof provides that:


âSection 1.  Application For Exemption.  Whenever a wage order provides for
exemption, applications thereto shall be filed with the appropriate Board which
shall process the same, 
subject to guidelines issued by the Commission.
â
(Underscoring supplied)


Clearly, it is the Commission that
is empowered to set [the] criteria on exemption from compliance with wage
orders.  While the Boards may issue
supplementary guidelines on exemption, the same should first pass the Commission
for the purpose of determining its conformity to the latterâs general policies
and guidelines relative thereto.  In
fact, under the âGuidelines on Exemption from Compliance with the Prescribed
Wage/Cost of Living Allowance Increases Granted by the Regional Tripartite
Wages and Productivity Boardsâ dated February 25, 1991, issued by the
Commission, there is a provision that â(T)he Board may issue supplementary
guidelines for exemption x x x  subject
to review/approval by the Commissionâ.  (Section 11).  In the case at
bar, after the Commission Secretariat made some comments on said Guidelines No.
3, the same was never submitted again for [the] Commissionâs approval either
justifying its original provisions or incorporating the comments made thereon.  Until and unless said Guidelines No. 3 is
approved by the Commission, it has no operative force and effect.


The applicable guidelines on
exemption therefore is that one issued by the Commission dated February 25,
1991, the pertinent portion of which reads:


âSection 3.  
CRITERIA FOR EXEMPTION


x x x
                        
x x x
                            
x x x 


2.  Distressed Employers/Establishment:


a.
    
In
the case of a stock corporation, partnership, single proprietorship or
non-stock, non-profit organization engaged in business activity or charging
fees for its services.


When 
accumulated losses
 at
end of the period under review 
have impaired by at least 25 percent the
:


- Paid-up-capital at the end of the
last full accounting period preceding the application, in the case of
corporations;


- Total invested capital at the beginning
of the last full accounting period preceding the application, in the case of
partnership and single proprietor-shipsâ(Underscoring supplied)


A perusal of the financial
documents on record shows that for the year 1990, which is the last full
accounting period preceding the applications for exemption, appellees NALCO,
ALCO, and PWC incurred a capital impairment of 1.89%, 28.72%, and 5.03%,
respectively.  Accordingly, based on the
criteria set forth above in the NWPC Guidelines on Exemption, only the application
for exemption of ALCO should be approved in view of its capital impairment of
28.72%.


We are
not unmindful of the fact that during the Board hearing conducted, both labor
and management manifested their desire for a uniform decision to apply to all
three (3) firms. However, we cannot grant the same for want of legal basis
considering that we are required by the rules to decide on the basis of the
merit of application by an establishment having a legal personality of its
own.â
[7]


In denying
petitionersâ motion for reconsideration, public respondent explained:


âThe fact that applicant companies
relied in good faith upon Guidelines No. 3 issued by the Board 
a quo
,
the same is not sufficient reason that they should be assessed based on the
criteria of said Guidelines considering that it does not conform to the
policies and guidelines relative to wage exemption issued by this Commission
pursuant to Republic Act 6727. Consequently, it has no force and effect. As
such, said Guidelines No. 3 cannot therefore be a source of a right no matter
if one has relied on it in good faith. In like manner that the workers, who are
similarly affected, cannot be bound thereof.


Moreover,
even assuming that Guidelines No. 3 conforms to the procedural requirement,
still, the same cannot be given effect insofar as it grants exemption by
industry considering that the subject Wage Order mentioned only 
distressed
establishments
 as one of those to be exempted thereof. It did not
mention 
exemption by industries
. Well-settled is the rule that an
implementing guidelines [sic] cannot expand nor limit the provision of [the]
law it seeks to implement. Otherwise, it shall be considered ultra vires. And,
contrary to applicant companiesâ claim, this Commission does not approve rules
implementing the Wage Orders issued by the Regional Tripartite Wages and
Productivity Boards. Perforce, it cannot be said that this Commission has  approved  the  Rules  Implementing  Wage  Order  No[s].  RX-01 and RX-01-A.â
[8]


Hence, this
recourse.
[9]


The Issue


Petitioners
raise this solitary issue:


âWith all due respect, Public
Respondent National Wages and Productivity Commission committed grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of or in excess of jurisdiction in ruling that
RTWPB-X-Guideline No. 3 has âno operative force and effectâ, among others, and
consequently, denying for lack of merit the application for exemption of
petitioners Nasipit Lumber Company, Inc. and Philippine Wallboard Corporation
from the coverage of Wage Orders Nos. RX-01 and RX-01-A.â


In the main, the
issue boils down to a question of power.  Is a guideline issued by an RTWPB without the approval of or, worse,
contrary to the guidelines promulgated by the NWPC valid?


The Courtâs Ruling


The petition is
unmeritorious.  The answer to the above
question is in the negative.


Sole Issue: 
  Approval of NWPC Required


Petitioners
contend that the NWPC gravely abused its discretion in overturning the RTWPBâs
approval of their application for exemption from Wage Orders RX-01 and
RX-01-A.  They argue that under Art.
122 (e) of the Labor Code, the RTWPB has the power â[t]o receive, process and
act on applications for exemption from prescribed wage rates as may be provided
by law or any wage order.â
[10]
 They also maintain that no law
expressly requires the approval of the NWPC for the effectivity of the RTWPBâs
Guideline No. 3.  Assuming 
arguendo

that the approval of the NWPC was legally necessary, petitioners should not be
prejudiced by their observance of the guideline, pointing out that the NWCPâs
own guidelines
[11]
 took effect âonly on 
March 18,
1991 
long after Guideline No. 3 was issued on 
November 26, 1990
.â
[12]
 Lastly, they posit that the NWPC
guidelines âcannot be given retroactive effect as [they] will affect or change
the petitionersâ vested rights.â
[13]


The Court is not
persuaded.


Power to Prescribe Guidelines Lodged in the NWPC, Not in
the RTWPB


The three great
branches and the various administrative agencies of the government can exercise
only those powers conferred upon them by the Constitution and the law.
[14]
 It is through the application of
this basic constitutional principle that the Court resolves the instant case.


RA 6727 (the
Wage Rationalization Act), amending the Labor Code, created both the NWPC and
the RTWPB and defined their respective powers.   Article 121 of the Labor Code lists the powers and functions of
the NWPC, as follows:


âART. 121.  
Powers and Functions of the Commission. 
-
The Commission shall have the following powers and functions:


(a)  To act as the national consultative and advisory body to the
President of the Philippine[s] and Congress on matters relating to wages,
incomes and productivity;


(b)  To formulate policies and guidelines on wages, incomes and
productivity improvement at the enterprise, industry and national levels;


(c)  
To prescribe rules and guidelines for the determination of
appropriate minimum wage and productivity measures at the regional, provincial
or industry levels;


(d)  
To review regional wage levels set by the Regional Tripartite
Wages and Productivity Boards to determine if these are in accordance with
prescribed guidelines and national development plans
;


(e)  To undertake studies, researches and surveys necessary for the
attainment of its functions and objectives, and to collect and compile data and
periodically disseminate information on wages and productivity and other
related information, including, but not limited to, employment, cost-of-living,
labor costs, investments and returns;


(f)  To review plans and programs of the Regional Tripartite Wages and
Productivity Boards to determine whether these are consistent with national
development plans;


(g)  To exercise technical and administrative supervision over the
Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards;


(h)  To call, from time to time, a national tripartite conference of
representatives of government, workers and employers for the consideration of
measures to promote wage rationalization and productivity; and 


(i)  To exercise such powers and functions as may be necessary to
implement this Act. 


x x x 
                     
x x x
             
x
x xâ (Underscoring supplied)


Article 122 of
the Labor Code, on the other hand, prescribes the powers of the RTWPB thus:


âART.122.  
Creation of Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards.




x x x
                      
x x x
                        
x
x x


The Regional Boards shall have the
following powers and functions in their respective territorial jurisdiction:


(a)  To develop plans, programs and projects relative to wages, income
and productivity improvement for their respective regions;


(b)  
To determine and fix minimum wage rates applicable in their
region, provinces or industries therein and to issue the corresponding wage
orders, subject to guidelines issued by the Commission
;


(c)  To undertake studies, researches, and surveys necessary for the
attainment of their functions, objectives and programs, and to collect and
compile data on wages, incomes, productivity and other related information and
periodically disseminate the same;


(d)  To coordinate with the other Regional Boards as may be necessary to
attain the policy and intention of this Code.


(e)  To receive, process and act on applications for exemption from
prescribed wage rates as may be provided by law or any Wage Order; and


(f)  To exercise such other powers and functions as may be necessary
to carry out their mandate under this Code.â  (Underscoring supplied)


The foregoing
clearly grants the NWPC, not the RTWPB, the power to âprescribe the rules and
guidelinesâ for the determination of minimum wage and productivity
measures.  While the RTWPB has the
power  to  issue wage orders under Article 122 (b) of the Labor Code, such
orders are subject to the guidelines prescribed by the NWPC.  One of these guidelines is the âRules on
Minimum Wage Fixing,â which was  issued
on June 4, 1990.
[15]
 Rule IV, Section 2 thereof, allows
the RTWPB to issue wage orders exempting enterprises from the coverage of the
prescribed minimum wages.
[16]
 However, the NWPC has the power not
only to prescribe guidelines to govern wage orders, but also to issue
exemptions therefrom, as the said rule provides that â[w]henever a wage order
provides for exemption, applications thereto shall be filed with the
appropriate Board which shall process the same, 
subject to guidelines issued
by the Commission
.â
[17]
 In short, the NWPC lays down the
guidelines which the RTWPB implements.


Significantly, the NWPC
authorized the RTWPB to issue exemptions from wage orders, but subject to its
review and approval.
[18]
 Since the NWPC never assented to Guideline No. 3 of
the RTWPB, the said guideline is inoperative and cannot be used by the latter
in deciding or acting on petitionersâ application for exemption.  Moreover, Rule VIII, Section 1 of the NWPCâs
Rules of Procedure on Minimum Wage Fixing issued on June 4, 1990 -- which was
prior to the effectivity of  RTWPB
Guideline No. 3 -- requires that an application for exemption from wage orders
should be processed by the RTWPB, subject specifically to the guidelines issued
by the NWPC.


To allow RTWPB
Guideline No. 3 to take effect without the approval of the NWPC is to arrogate
unto RTWPB a power vested in the NWPC by Article 121 of the Labor Code, as
amended by RA 6727.  The Court will not
countenance this naked usurpation of authority.  It is a hornbook doctrine that the issuance of an administrative
rule or regulation must be in harmony with the enabling law.  If a discrepancy occurs âbetween the basic
law and an implementing rule or regulation, it is the former that prevails.â
[19]
 This is so because the law cannot
be broadened by a mere administrative issuance.  It is axiomatic that â[a]n administrative agency cannot amend an
act of Congress.â
[20]
 Article 122 (e) of the Labor Code
cannot be construed to enable the RTWPB to decide applications for exemption on
the basis of its own guidelines which were not reviewed and approved by the
NWPC, for the simple reason that a statutory grant of âpowers should not be
extended by implication beyond what may be necessary for their just and
reasonable execution.  
Official
powers cannot be merely assumed by administrative officers, nor can they be
created by the courts in the exercise of their judicial functions
.â
[21]


There is no
basis for petitionersâ claim that their vested rights were prejudiced by the
NWPCâs alleged retroactive application of its own rules
[22]
 which were issued on February 25,
1991 and took effect on March 18, 1991.
[23]
 Such claim cannot stand because
Guideline No. 3, as previously discussed and as correctly concluded by the
NWPC,
[24]
 was not valid and, thus, cannot be
a source of a right; much less, a vested one. 


The Insertion in Guideline No. 3 of âDistressed Industryâ
as a Criterion for Exemption Void


The Court wishes
to stress that the law does not automatically grant exemption to all
establishments belonging to an industry which is deemed âdistressed.â  Hence, RX-O1, Section 3 (4), must not be
construed to automatically include all establishments belonging to a distressed
industry.  The fact that the wording of
a wage order may contain some ambiguity would not help petitioners.  Basic is the rule in statutory construction
that all doubts in the implementation and the interpretation of the provisions
of the Labor Code, as well as its implementing rules and regulations, must be
resolved in favor of labor.
[25]
 By exempting all establishments
belonging to a distressed industry, Guideline No. 3 surreptitiously and
irregularly takes away the mandated increase in the minimum wage awarded to the
affected workers.  In so acting, the
RTWPB proceeded against the declared policy of the State, enshrined in the
enabling act, âto rationalize the fixing of minimum wages and to promote
productivity-improvement and gain-sharing measures to ensure a decent standard
of living for the workers and their families; to guarantee the rights of labor
to its just share in the fruits of production; x x x.â
[26]
 Thus,  Guideline No. 3 is void not only because it lacks NWPC approval
and contains an arbitrarily inserted exemption,  but also because it is inconsistent with the avowed State
policies protective of labor.  


NWPC Decision Not Arbitrary


To justify the exemption
of a distressed establishment from effects of wage orders, the NWPC requires
the applicant, if a stock corporation like petitioners, to prove that its
accumulated losses impaired its paid-up capital by at least 25 percent in the
last full accounting period preceding the application
[27]
 or the effectivity of the order.
[28]
 In the case at bar, it is
undisputed that during the relevant accounting period, NALCO, ALCO and PWC
sustained capital impairments of 1.89, 28.72, and 5.03 percent, respectively.
[29]
 Clearly, it was only ALCO which met
the exemption standard.  Hence, the NWPC
did not commit grave abuse of discretion in approving the application only of
ALCO and in denying those of petitioners.  Indeed, the NWPC acted within the ambit of its administrative
prerogative when it set guidelines for the exemption of a distressed
establishment.  Absent any grave abuse
of discretion, NWPCâs actions will not be subject to judicial review.
[30]
 Accordingly, we deem the appealed
Decisions to be consistent with law.
