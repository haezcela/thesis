REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT
CONDUCTED IN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 27, OF LAPU-LAPU CITY, PRESIDED
OVER BY JUDGE TEODORO K. RISOS 

D E C I S I O N




REGALADO, J.:


In view of the
compulsory retirement of Judge Teodoro K. Risos on December 12, 1997, a
judicial audit was conducted at the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27, Lapu-Lapu
City on all pending cases therein, including those submitted for decision.
Acting on the Report of Judicial Audit Team dated August 27, 1997, the Court 
En
Banc
 resolved on October 7, 1997, among others, to: (a) direct Judge Risos
to : (1) render his decision in criminal  cases
[1]
 and civil cases
[2]
 already submitted for decision and
submit proof of such disposal; (2) explain why no court action should be taken
against him for his failure to decide some cases within the 90-day period; (3)
explain why no court action was taken for a considerable length of time in some
criminal cases
[3]
 and civil cases
[4]
 pending before his court; (b)
require Atty. Annie Christine B. Patalinghug, Branch Clerk of Court, Regional
Trial Court, Branch 27, Lapu-Lapu City (b-1) to explain: (aa) why no
Certificates of Arraignments and Minutes of the Hearing are attached to the
records of some cases; (bb) why the docket books are not updated and (b-2)
direct her to devise an effective system in the management of court records;
and meanwhile (c) the Financial Management Office of the Office of the Court
Administrator is directed to withhold the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos
(P100,000.00) from the retirement benefits which may be due to Judge Risos to
answer for whatever administrative liabilities may be imposed upon him should
he fail to satisfactorily explain the delay in the resolution and the inaction
in some cases pending in his sala.


Judge Risos, in
compliance with said resolution, filed his First Indorsement dated November 20,
1997, and submitted the following information and explanation to this Court, to
wit: (1) All the criminal and civil cases enumerated in Directive No. 1 of the
Resolution have already been disposed of, as evidence by accompanying copies of
the corresponding decisions; (2) The reason why some cases were decided beyond
the 90-day period was due to: (a) the pressure of work, being the Executive
Judge of the RTC of Lapu-Lapu City, (b) the fact that he had to slow down his
work after his second heart attack, (c) slow turnout of transcripts, (d) the
destruction of his notes taken down during the hearing of said cases when a
portion of the roofing of the dilapidated building where Branch 27 is being
housed was removed by the last  typhoon
which hit Cebu, and (e) preference was given to the disposition of cases
involving detention prisoners; (3) It is not correct that no action was taken
for a considerable length of time in the criminal, civil and cadastral cases
mentioned in Directive No. 3 of the resolution. He reasoned out that all the
criminal cases mentioned there have already been disposed of, except Criminal
Case No. 517. It was one of the 89 inherited cases heard and submitted for
decision before the late Judge Ceferino Dulay, and the testimony of the accused
and his witnesses were not transcribed by the stenographer who died, hence a
retaking has been ordered. Some of the civil and cadastral cases mentioned have
been disposed of and/or are still awaiting the Land Registration Authority
(LRA) report.


A judicious
examination of the records shows that out of the ten (10) criminal cases
reported to have been pending decisions beyond the 90-day period required,
Judge Risos was able to decide eight (8) criminal cases before he tired. With
regard to the other two (2) criminal cases, Criminal Case No. 01234 should not
have included in the list as it was submitted for decision only on July 1,
1997, hence still within the required period. In fact, it was decided by Judge
Risos on august 14, 1997. Criminal Case No. 01234 should not have been included
in the list as it was submitted for decidion only on July 1, 1997, hence still
within the required period. In fact, it was decided by Judge Risos on August
14, 1997. Criminal Case No. 012139 was archived because the accused is
presently at large.


Regarding the
six (6) civil cases reported to have been pending decision beyond the required
period, Judge Risos was able to decide four (4) of them before he retired.  Civil Case No. 2715-L was still set for
hearing on January 30, 1998, and Civil Case No. 2976-L was reraffled to the
newly created Branch 54.


As to the
cadastral cases, Judge Risos was able to act on those cases which were reported
to have remained unacted upon although after the lapse of a considerable length
if time, with the exception of those cases awaiting the LRA reports.
Furthermore, Criminal Case No. 018085 and ASA VII-05-1147 were inadvertently
reported by the auditing team, as there were no such cases in his sala.


The  Office of the Court Administrator (OCA)
noted that although Judge Risos was able to decide those cases that had long
been submitted for decision beyond the 90-day period, as well as several other
cases which were  submitted for decision
but still within the prescibed period, he failed to present any proof that they
were duly filed with the Clerk of Court as required byn Section 1, Rule 36 of
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
[5]
 No registry receipts nor any
evidence were attached to show that copies of the decisions were duly served
upon the parties either personally or by registered mail is required by Section
9, Rule 23.
[6]
 His judgments in the criminal cases
likewise failed to indicate whether they had already been promulgated.
Evidently, it is not enough that judges write their decisions; it is also just
as important that they promulgate and make them know to all parties concerned.
[7]


On January 28,
1998. A verification call was made by the OCA with the new OIC-Clerk of Court,
Dolores P. Lagrimas. She informed the said office that the decisions were duly
filed with the Clerk of Court, that the parties were duly served with copies of
the decisions, and that the judgments in the criminal cases had already been
promulgated. She further explained that the inclusion of two (2) non-existing
cases in the list was due to typographical errors in the case numbers because
the resolution of this Court merely enumerated the case numbers without
specifying the titles of the cases.


Although Judge
Risos was able to decide practically all the criminal and civil cases
enumerated in Directive No. 1 of the Resolution dated October 7, 1997, the
records nonetheless reveal that they were decided beyond the 90-day period.
This Court has consistently impressed upon judges the need to decide cases
promptly and exepeditously, pursuant to Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of
Judicial conduct and section 15(1) and (2), Article VIII of the Constitution.
This requirement is designed to prevent delay in the administration of justice
for, obviously, justice delayed is justice denied; and delay in the disposition
of cases erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary, lowers
its standards and brings it into disrepute.
[8]
 Judges are repeatedly reminded  that failure to decide cases within the
required period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency
[9]
 which is a ground for
administrative sanction against the defaulting judge.
[10]


The Court cannot
consider the slow turnout of transcripts as a valid excuse for delay in
rendering judgment in a case. It is an established rule and directive that with
or without the transcript of stenographic notes, the 90-day period for deciding
cases should be observed by all judges.
[11]
 If a heavy caseload and his duties
as an executive judge prevented him  from deciding cases within the reglementary period, Judge Risos should
have asked this Court for the reasonable extension of time to decide the cases
involved
[12]
 However, it appears of record that
there was no attempt whatsoever on the part of respondent judge to inform this
Court of his alleged predicament and to make such request.


Neither can the
destruction of his notes during the last typhoon which hit Cebu be considered
as a valid defense for the delay because it likewise appears on record that,
except for Criminal Case No. 012167 which was submitted for decision last
January 14, 1997, those cases had long been pending decisions for years, dating
way back to 1988 (Criminal Case No. 0530), 1990 (Criminal Case No. 0595), 1991
(Criminal Case No. 01184), 1992 (Criminal Case No. 40119-L),  1995 (Criminal Case Nos. 0156 and 012181,
and Civil Case No. 2359-L), and 1996 (Civil Cases Nos. 4174-L and 2411-L).


Arguably, the
liability of respondent judge for his failure to decide cases within the 90-day
period may be tempered by the fact that he had to slow down on his work after
he had his second heart attack. This is confirmed by the OCA in its findings
and recommendation which we approve with modification. Withal, while we are
inclined to adopt a liberal and understanding attitude towards respondent
judge, the indelible fact remains that his default in deciding said cases had
lasted for so many years to prejudice of the litigants concerned, and to whose
plight he appears to have been indifferent as shown by his inaction.


Parenthetically,
Atty. Annie Christine B. Patalinghug, Branch Clerk of Court, failed to comply
with the requirements and duties imposed on her in the aforesaid resolution. A
verification was made with the OCA and it turned out that Atty. Patalinghug had
resigned from office effective January 26, 1998, thus mooting the directives in
the Courtâs resolution insofar as she was concerned and rendering the same
unenforceable against her.


With respect to
Judge Risos, however, the Court cannot escape the fact that he failed to decide
twelve (12) cases within the 90-day period for reasons not completely
exculpatory. His liability will have to be assessed in line and consistent with
our decisional precedents in similar cases.
[13]
 Thus, in the cited case of Re:
Judge Danilo M. Tenerife, the failure of a judge to decide even a single case
within the 90-day period was considered gross inefficiency warranting the
imposition of a fine ranging from P5,000.00 to the equivalent of one monthâs
salary. In the instant case, after considering the facts at hand and the
extenuating circumstance of failing health in favor of respondent judge,
the  Court deems it proper that a fine P10,000.00
be imposed.


WHEREFORE, 
respondent Judge Teodoro K. Risos is
hereby declared guilty of GROSS INEFFICIENCY and is ORDERED to pay a fine of
TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00), to be deducted from the retirement benefits
due and payable to him.
