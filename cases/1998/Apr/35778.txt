MARTINEZ, J.:


The dramatic and
well-publicized hunger strike staged by some alleged farmer-beneficiaries in
front of the Department of Agrarian Reform compound in Quezon City on October
9, 1997 commanded nationwide attention that even church leaders and some
presidential candidates tried to intervene for the strikersâ âcause.â  


The strikers
protested the March 29, 1996 Decision
[1]
 of the Office of the President (OP),
issued through then Executive Secretary Ruben D. Torres in OP Case No.
96-C-6424, which approved the conversion of a one hundred forty-four (144)-hectare
land from agricultural to agro-industrial/institutional area. This led the
Office of the President, through then Deputy Executive Secretary Renato C.
Corona, to issue the so-called âWin-Winâ Resolution
[2]
 on November 7, 1997, substantially 
modifying

its earlier Decision 
after it had
 
already become final and executory
.  The said Resolution modified the approval of
the land conversion to agro-industrial area only to the extent of forty-four (44)
hectares, and ordered the remaining one hundred (100) hectares to be
distributed to qualified farmer-beneficiaries.


But, did the
âWin-Winâ Resolution culminate in victory for all the contending parties?


The above-named
petitioners cried foul.  They have come
to this Court urging us to annul and set aside the âWin-Winâ Resolution and to
enjoin respondent Secretary Ernesto D. Garilao of the Department of Agrarian
Reform from implementing the said Resolution.


Thus, the
crucial issue to be resolved in this case is: What is the legal effect of the
âWin-Winâ Resolution issued by the Office of the President on its earlier
Decision involving the same subject matter, which had already become final and
executory?


The antecedent
facts of this controversy, as culled from the pleadings, may be stated as
follows:


1. This case
involves a 144-hectare land located at San Vicente, Sumilao, Bukidnon, owned by
the Norberto Quisumbing, Sr. Management and Development Corporation (NQSRMDC),
one of the petitioners. The property is covered by a Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 14371
[3]
 of the Registry of Deeds of the
Province of Bukidnon.


2. In 1984, the
land was leased as a pineapple plantation to the Philippine Packing
Corporation, now Del Monte Philippines, Inc. (DMPI), a multinational
corporation, for a period of ten (10) years under the Crop Producer and
Growerâs Agreement duly annotated in the certificate of title.  The lease expired in April, 1994.


3. In October,
1991, during the existence of the lease, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR)
placed the entire 144-hectare property under compulsory acquisition and
assessed the land value at 
P
2.38 million.
[4]


4. NQSRMDC
resisted the DARâs action.  In February,
1992, it sought and was granted by the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB), through its
Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) in DARAB Case No. X-576, a writ
of prohibition with preliminary injunction which ordered the DAR Region X
Director, the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer (PARO) of Bukidnon, the
Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO) of Sumilao, Bukidnon, the Land Bank of
the Philippines (Land Bank), and their authorized representatives âto desist
from pursuing any activity or activitiesâ concerning the subject land âuntil
further orders.â
[5]


5. Despite the
DARAB order of March 31, 1992, the DAR Regional Director issued a memorandum,
dated May 21, 1992, directing the Land Bank to open a trust account for 
P
2.38
million in the name of NQSRMDC and to conduct summary proceedings to determine
the just compensation of the subject property.  NQSRMDC objected to these moves and filed on June 9, 1992 an
Omnibus Motion to enforce the DARAB order of March 31, 1992 and to nullify the
summary proceedings undertaken by the DAR Regional Director and Land Bank on
the valuation of the subject property.  


6. The DARAB, on
October 22, 1992, acted favorably on the Omnibus Motion by (a) ordering the DAR
Regional Director and Land Bank âto seriously comply with the terms of the
order dated March 31, 1992;â (b) nullifying  the DAR Regional Directorâs memorandum, dated May 21, 1992, and the
summary proceedings conducted pursuant thereto; and  (c) directing the Land Bank âto return the claim folder of
Petitioner NQSRMDCâs subject property to the DAR until further orders.â
[6]


7. The Land Bank
complied with the DARAB order and cancelled the trust account it opened in the
name of petitioner NQSRMDC.
[7]


8. In the
meantime, the Provincial Development Council (PDC) of Bukidnon, headed by
Governor Carlos O. Fortich, passed Resolution No. 6,
[8]
 dated January 7, 1993, designating
certain areas along Bukidnon-Sayre Highway as part of the Bukidnon
Agro-Industrial Zones where the subject property is situated.


9. What happened
thereafter is well-narrated in the OP (TORRES) Decision of March 29, 1996,
pertinent portions of which we quote:


âPursuant to Section 20 of R.A. No.
7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, the Sangguniang Bayan of
Sumilao, Bukidnon, on March 4, 1993, enacted Ordinance No. 24 converting or
re-classifying 144 hectares of land in Bgy. San Vicente, said Municipality,
from agricultural to industrial/institutional with a view of providing an
opportunity to attract investors who can inject new economic vitality, provide
more jobs and raise the income of its people.


âParenthetically,
under said section, 4
th
 to 5
th
 class municipalities may authorize the classification of
five percent (5%) of their agricultural land area and provide for the manner of
their utilization or disposition.


âOn 12 October 1993, the Bukidnon
Provincial Land Use Committee approved the said Ordinance.  Accordingly, on 11 December 1993, the
instant application for conversion was filed by Mr. Gaudencio Beduya in behalf
of NQSRMDC/BAIDA (Bukidnon Agro-Industrial Development Association).


âExpressing support for the
proposed project, the Bukidnon Provincial Board, on the basis of a Joint
Committee Report submitted by its Committee on Laws, Committee on Agrarian
Reform and Socio-Economic Committee approved, on 1 February 1994, the said
Ordinance now docketed as Resolution No. 94-95.  The said industrial area, as conceived by NQSRMDC (project
proponent) is supposed to have the following components:


â1. The Development Academy of
Mindanao which constitutes the following: Institute for Continuing Higher
Education; Institute for Livelihood Science (Vocational and Technical School);
Institute for Agribusiness Research; Museum, Library, Cultural Center, and
Mindanao Sports Development Complex which covers an area of 24 hectares;


â2. Bukidnon Agro-Industrial Park
which consists of corn processing for corn oil, corn starch, various corn
products; rice processing for wine, rice-based snacks, exportable rice; cassava
processing for starch, alcohol and food delicacies; processing plants, fruits
and fruit products such as juices; processing plants for vegetables processed
and prepared for market; cold storage and ice plant; cannery system; commercial
stores; public market; and abattoir needing about 67 hectares;


â3. Forest development which
includes open spaces and parks for recreation, horse-back riding, memorial and
mini-zoo estimated to cover 33 hectares; and


â4. Support facilities which comprise
the construction of a 360-room hotel, restaurants, dormitories and a housing
project covering an area of 20 hectares.


âThe said NQSRMDC Proposal was, per
Certification dated January 4, 1995, adopted by the Department of Trade and
Industry, Bukidnon Provincial Office, as one of its flagship projects.  The same was likewise favorably recommended
by the Provincial Development Council of Bukidnon; the municipal, provincial
and regional office of the DAR; the Regional Office (Region X) of the DENR (which
issued an Environmental Compliance Certificate on June 5, 1995); the Executive
Director, signing âBy Authority of PAUL G. DOMINGUEZ,â Office of the President
â Mindanao; the Secretary of DILG; and Undersecretary of DECS Wilfredo D.
Clemente.


âIn the same vein, the National
Irrigation Administration, Provincial Irrigation Office, Bagontaas Valencia,
Bukidnon, thru Mr. Julius S. Maquiling, Chief, Provincial Irrigation Office,
interposed NO OBJECTION to the proposed conversion âas long as the development
cost of the irrigation systems thereat which is 
P
2,377.00 per hectare be
replenished by the developer x x x.â  Also, the Kisolon-San Vicente Irrigators Multi Purpose Cooperative, San
Vicente, Sumilao, Bukidnon, interposed no objection to the proposed conversion
of the land in question âas it will provide more economic benefits to the
community in terms of  outside
investments that will come and employment opportunities that will be generated
by the projects to be put up x x x.â


âOn the same score, it is represented
that during the public consultation held at the Kisolan Elementary School on 18
March 1995 with Director Jose Macalindong of DAR Central Office and DECS
Undersecretary Clemente, the people of the affected barangay rallied behind
their respective officials in endorsing the project.


âNotwithstanding the foregoing
favorable recommendation, however, on November 14, 1994, the DAR, thru
Secretary Garilao, invoking its powers to approve conversion of lands under
Section 65 of R.A. No. 6657, issued an Order denying the instant application
for the conversion of the subject land from agricultural to agro-industrial
and, instead, placed the same under the compulsory coverage of CARP and
directed the distribution thereof to all qualified beneficiaries on the following
grounds: 


â1. The area is considered as a
prime agricultural land with irrigation facility;


â2. The land has long been covered
by a Notice of Compulsory Acquisition (NCA);


â3. The existing policy on
withdrawal or lifting on areas covered by NCA is not applicable;


â4. There is no clear and tangible
compensation package arrangements for the beneficiaries;


â5. The procedures on how the area
was identified and reclassified for agro-industrial project has no reference to
Memo Circular No. 54, Series of 1993, E.O. No. 72, Series of 1993, and E.O. No.
124, Series of 1993.


âA Motion
for Reconsideration of the aforesaid Order was filed on January 9, 1995 by
applicant but the same was denied (in an Order dated June 7, 1995).â
[9]


10. Thus, the
DAR Secretary ordered the DAR Regional Director âto proceed with the compulsory
acquisition and distribution of the property.â
[10]


11. Governor
Carlos O. Fortich of Bukidnon appealed
[11]
 the order of denial to the Office
of the President and prayed for the conversion/reclassification of the subject
land as the same would be more beneficial to the people of Bukidnon.


12. To prevent
the enforcement of the DAR Secretaryâs order, NQSRMDC, on June 29, 1995, filed
with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari, prohibition with preliminary
injunction,
[12]
 docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 37614. 


13. Meanwhile,
on July 25, 1995, the Honorable Paul G. Dominguez, then Presidential Assistant
for Mindanao, after conducting an evaluation of the proposed project, sent a
memorandum
[13]
 to the President favorably
endorsing the project with a recommendation that the DAR Secretary reconsider
his decision in denying the application of the province for the conversion of
the land.


14. Also, in a
memorandum
[14]
 to the President dated August 23,
1995, the Honorable Rafael Alunan III, then Secretary of the Department of the
Interior and Local Government (DILG), recommended the conversion of the subject
land to industrial/institutional use with a request that the President âhold
the implementation of the DAR order to distribute the land in question.â


15. On October
23, 1995, the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. SP No. 37614, issued a Resolution
[15]
 ordering the parties to observe
status quo pending resolution of the petition.  At the hearing held in said case on October 5, 1995, the DAR, through
the Solicitor General, manifested before the said court that the DAR was merely
âin the processing stage of the applications of farmers-claimantsâ and has
agreed to respect status quo pending the resolution of the petition.
[16]


16. In resolving
the appeal, the Office of the President, through then Executive Secretary Ruben
D. Torres, issued a Decision in OP Case No. 96-C-6424, dated March 29, 1996,
reversing the DAR Secretaryâs decision, the pertinent portions of which read:


âAfter a careful evaluation of the
petition vis-Ã -vis the grounds upon which the denial thereof by Secretary
Garilao was based, we find that the instant application for conversion by the
Municipality of Sumilao, Bukidnon is impressed with merit.  To be sure, converting the land in question
from agricultural to agro-industrial would open great opportunities for
employment and bring about real development in the area towards a sustained
economic growth of the municipality.  On
the other hand, distributing the land to would-be beneficiaries (who are not
even tenants, as there are none) does not guarantee such benefits.


âNevertheless, on the issue that
the land is considered a prime agricultural land with irrigation facility it
maybe appropriate to mention that, as claimed by petitioner, while it is true
that there is, indeed, an irrigation facility in the area, the same merely
passes thru the property (as a right of way) to provide water to the ricelands
located on the lower portion thereof.  The land itself, subject of the instant petition, is not irrigated as
the same was, for several years, planted with pineapple by the Philippine
Packing Corporation.


âOn the issue that the land has
long been covered by a Notice of Compulsory Acquisition (NCA) and that the existing
policy on withdrawal or lifting on areas covered by NCA is not applicable,
suffice it to state that the said NCA was declared null and void by the
Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) as early as March 1,
1992.  Deciding in favor of NQSRMDC, the
DARAB correctly pointed out that under Section 8 of R.A. No. 6657, the subject
property could not validly be the subject of compulsory acquisition until after
the expiration of the lease contract with Del Monte Philippines, a Multi-National
Company, or until April 1994, and ordered the DAR Regional Office and the Land
Bank of the Philippines, both in Butuan City, to `desist from pursuing any
activity or activities covering petitionerâs land.


âOn this score, we take special
notice of the fact that the Quisumbing family has already contributed
substantially to the land reform program of the government, as follows: 300
hectares of rice land in Nueva Ecija in the 70âs and another 400 hectares in
the nearby Municipality of Impasugong, Bukidnon, ten (10) years ago, for which
they have not received âjust compensationâ up to this time.


âNeither can the assertion that
âthere is no clear and tangible compensation package arrangements for the
beneficiariesâ hold water as, in the first place, there are no beneficiaries to
speak about, for the land is not tenanted as already stated.


âNor can procedural lapses in the
manner of identifying/reclassifying the subject property for agro-industrial
purposes be allowed to defeat the very purpose of the law granting autonomy to
local government units in the management of their local affairs.  Stated more simply, the language of Section
20 of R.A. No. 7160, supra, is clear and affords no room for any other
interpretation.  By unequivocal legal
mandate, it grants local government units autonomy in their local affairs
including the power to convert portions of their agricultural lands and provide
for the manner of their utilization and disposition to enable them to attain
their fullest development as self-reliant communities.


âWHEREFORE,
in pursuance of the spirit and intent of the said legal mandate and in view of
the favorable recommendations of the various government agencies
abovementioned, the subject Order, dated November 14, 1994 of the Hon.
Secretary, Department of Agrarian Reform, is hereby SET ASIDE and the instant
application of NQSRMDC/BAIDA is hereby APPROVED.â
[17]


17.On May 20,
1996, DAR filed a motion for reconsideration of the OP decision. 


18 On September
11, 1996, in compliance with the OP decision of March 29, 1996, NQSRMDC and the
Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) executed a Memorandum of
Agreement  whereby the former donated
four (4) hectares from the subject land to DECS for the establishment of the
NQSR High School.
[18]


When NQSRMDC was
about to transfer the title over the 4-hectare donated to DECS, it discovered
that the title over the subject property was no longer in its name. It soon
found out that during the pendency of both the Petition for Certiorari,
Prohibition, with Preliminary Injunction it filed against DAR in the Court of
Appeals and the appeal to the President filed by Governor Carlos O. Fortich,
the DAR, without giving just compensation, caused the cancellation of NQSRMDCâs
title on August 11, 1995 and had it transferred in the name of the Republic of
the Philippines under TCT No. T-50264
[19]
 of the Registry of Deeds of
Bukidnon. Thereafter, on September 25, 1995, DAR caused the issuance of
Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) No. 00240227 and had it registered
in the name of 137 farmer-beneficiaries under TCT No. AT-3536
[20]
 of the Registry of Deeds of
Bukidnon. 


19. Thus, on
April 10, 1997, NQSRMDC filed a complaint
[21]
 with the Regional Trial Court (RTC)
of Malaybalay, Bukidnon (Branch 9), docketed as Civil Case No. 2687-97, for
annulment and cancellation of title, damages and injunction against DAR and 141
others.  The RTC then issued a Temporary
Restraining Order on April 30, 1997
[22]
 and a Writ of Preliminary
Injunction on May 19, 1997
,
[23]
 restraining the DAR and 141 others
from entering, occupying and/or wresting from NQSRMDC the possession of the
subject land.


20. Meanwhile,
on June 23, 1997, an Order
[24]
 was issued by then Executive
Secretary Ruben D. Torres denying DARâs motion for reconsideration for having
been filed beyond the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days.  The said order further declared that the
March 29, 1996 OP decision had already become 
final
 and 
executory
.


21. The DAR
filed on July 11, 1997 a 
second
 motion for reconsideration of the June
23, 1997 Order of the President.


22.  On August 12, 1997, the said writ of
preliminary injunction issued by the RTC was challenged by some alleged farmers
before the Court of Appeals through a petition for certiorari and prohibition,
docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 44905, praying for the lifting of the injunction and
for the issuance of a writ of prohibition from further trying the RTC case. 


23.  On October 9, 1997, some alleged
farmer-beneficiaries began their hunger strike in front of the DAR Compound in
Quezon City to protest the OP Decision of March 29, 1996.  On October 10, 1997, some persons claiming
to be farmer-beneficiaries of the NQSRMDC property filed a motion for
intervention (styled as Memorandum In Intervention) in O.P. Case No. 96-C-6424,
asking that the OP Decision allowing the conversion of the entire 144-hectare
property be set aside.
[25]


24.  President Fidel V. Ramos then held a
dialogue with the strikers and promised to resolve their grievance within the
framework of the law.  He created an
eight (8)-man Fact Finding Task Force (FFTF) chaired by Agriculture Secretary
Salvador Escudero to look into the controversy and recommend possible solutions
to the problem.
[26]


25.  On November 7, 1997, the Office of the
President resolved the strikersâ protest by issuing the so-called âWin/Winâ
Resolution penned by then Deputy Executive Secretary Renato C. Corona, the
dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
the decision of the Office of the President, through Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres, dated March 29, 1996, is hereby MODIFIED as follows:


â1. NQSRMDCâs application for conversion is APPROVED
only with respect to the approximately forty-four (44) hectare portion of the
land adjacent to the highway, as recommended by the Department of Agriculture.


â2. The remaining approximately one hundred (100)
hectares traversed by an irrigation canal and found to be suitable for
agriculture shall be distributed to qualified farmer-beneficiaries in
accordance with RA 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law with a right
of way to said portion from the highway provided in the portion fronting the
highway.  For this purpose, the DAR and
other concerned government agencies are directed to immediately conduct the
segregation survey of the area, valuation of the property and generation of
titles in the name of the identified farmer-beneficiaries.


â3. The Department of Agrarian Reform is hereby
directed to carefully and meticulously determine who among the claimants are
qualified farmer-beneficiaries.


â4. The Department of Agrarian Reform is hereby
further directed to expedite payment of just compensation to NQSRMDC for the
portion of the land to be covered by the CARP, including other lands previously
surrendered by NQSRMDC for CARP coverage.


â5. The Philippine National Police is hereby directed
to render full assistance to the Department of Agrarian Reform in the
implementation of this Order.


âWe take note of the Memorandum in
Intervention filed by 113 farmers on October 10, 1997 without ruling on the
propriety or merits thereof since it is unnecessary to pass upon it at this
time.


âSO
ORDERED.â
[27]


A copy of the
âWin-Winâ Resolution was received by Governor Carlos O. Fortich of Bukidnon,
Mayor Rey B. Baula of Sumilao, Bukidnon, and NQSRMDC on November 24, 1997
[28]
 and, on December 4, 1997, they
filed the present petition for certiorari, prohibition (under Rule 65 of the
Revised Rules of Court) and injunction with urgent prayer for a temporary
restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction (under Rule 58, 
ibid
.),
against then Deputy Executive Secretary Renato C. Corona and DAR Secretary
Ernesto D. Garilao. 


On December 12,
1997, a Motion For Leave To Intervene
[29]
 was filed by alleged
farmer-beneficiaries, through counsel, claiming that they are real parties in
interest as they were âpreviously identified by respondent DAR as agrarian
reform beneficiaries on the 144-hectareâ property subject of this case.  The motion was vehemently opposed
[30]
 by the petitioners.


In seeking the
nullification of the âWin-Winâ Resolution, the petitioners claim that the
Office of the President was prompted to issue the said resolution âafter a very
well-managed hunger strike led by fake farmer-beneficiary Linda Ligmon succeeded
in pressuring and/or politically blackmailing the Office of the President to
come up with this purely political decision to appease the âfarmers,â by
reviving and modifying the Decision of 29 March 1996 
which has been declared
final and executory in an Order of 23 June 1997â¦.â
[31]
 
Thus, petitioners further allege, respondent then
Deputy Executive Secretary Renato C. Corona âcommitted grave abuse of
discretion and acted beyond his jurisdiction when he issued the questioned
Resolution of 7 November 1997â¦.â
[32]
 They availed of this extraordinary
writ of certiorari âbecause there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy
in the ordinary course of law.â
[33]
 They never filed a motion for
reconsideration of the subject Resolution âbecause (it) is patently illegal or
contrary to law and it would be a futile exercise to seek a reconsideration â¦.â
[34]


The respondents,
through the Solicitor General, opposed the petition and prayed that it be
dismissed outright on the following grounds:


(1)  The proper remedy of petitioners should have
been to file a petition for review directly with the Court of Appeals in
accordance with Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court;


(2)  The petitioners failed to file a motion for
reconsideration of the assailed âWin-Winâ Resolution before filing the present petition;
and 


(3)  Petitioner NQSRMDC is guilty of
forum-shopping.


These are the
preliminary issues which must first be resolved, including the incident on the
motion for intervention filed by the alleged farmer-beneficiaries.


Anent the first
issue, in order to determine whether the recourse of petitioners is proper or
not, it is necessary to draw a line between an error of judgment and an error
of jurisdiction.  An 
error of
judgment
 is one which the court may commit 
in the exercise of its
jurisdiction
,
 
and which error is reviewable only by an appeal.
[35]
 On the other hand, an 
error of
jurisdiction
 is one where the act complained of was issued by the court,
officer or a quasi-judicial body 
without 
or 
in excess of jurisdiction
,
or 
with grave abuse of discretion which is tantamount to lack or in excess
of jurisdiction
.
[36]
 This error is correctable only by
the extraordinary writ of certiorari.
[37]


  It is true that under Rule 43, appeals from
awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of any quasi-judicial agency exercising
quasi-judicial functions,
[38]
 
including the Office of the
President
,
[39]
 may be taken to the Court of
Appeals by filing a verified petition for review
[40]
 within fifteen (15) days from
notice of the said judgment, final order or resolution,
[41]
 whether the appeal involves
questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.
[42]


However, we hold
that, in this particular case, the remedy prescribed in Rule 43 is inapplicable
considering that the present petition contains an allegation that the challenged
resolution is âpatently illegalâ
[43]
 and was issued with âgrave abuse of
discretionâ and âbeyond his (respondent Secretary Renato C. Coronaâs)
jurisdictionâ
[44]
 when said resolution substantially
modified the earlier OP Decision of March 29, 1996 which had long become final
and executory.  In other words, the
crucial issue raised here involves an error of jurisdiction, not an error of
judgment which is reviewable by an appeal under Rule 43.  Thus, the appropriate remedy to annul and
set aside the assailed resolution is an original special civil action for
certiorari under Rule 65, as what the petitioners have correctly done.  The pertinent portion of Section 1 thereof
provides:


âSECTION 1. 
Petition for
certiorari
. â When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his
jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy
in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified
petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying
that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such
tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and
justice may require.


x x x
                                  
x x x
                                  
x x x.â


The office of a writ of certiorari is restricted to truly extraordinary
cases â cases in which the act of the lower court or quasi-judicial body is
wholly void.
[45]


The aforequoted Section
1 of Rule 65 mandates that the person aggrieved by the assailed illegal act
âmay file a verified petition (for certiorari) in the 
proper court
.â  The proper court where the petition must be
filed is stated in Section 4 of the same Rule 65 which reads:


âSEC. 4.  
Where petition filed
.- The petition may be filed not later
than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution sought to
be assailed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of
a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional
Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the
Supreme Court.  It may also be filed in
the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate
jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its jurisdiction.  If it involves the acts or omissions of a
quasi-judicial agency, and unless otherwise provided by law or these Rules, the
petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals. (4a)â


Under the
above-quoted Section 4, the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and Regional Trial
Court have original concurrent jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari,
[46]
 prohibition
[47]
 and mandamus.
[48]
 But the jurisdiction of these three
(3) courts are also delineated in that, if the challenged act relates to acts
or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person,
the petition must be filed with the Regional Trial Court which exercises
jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court.  And if it involves the act or omission of a
quasi-judicial agency, the petition shall be filed only with the Court of
Appeals, unless otherwise provided by law or the Rules of Court.  We have clearly discussed this matter of
concurrence of jurisdiction in 
People vs. Cuaresma, et. al
.,
[49]
 through now Chief Justice  Andres R. Narvasa, thus:


âx x x.  This Courtâs original jurisdiction to issue writs of 
certiorari

(as well as prohibition, 
mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus
 and
injunction) is not exclusive.  It is
shared by this Court with Regional Trial Courts (formerly Courts of First
Instance), which may issue the writ, enforceable in any part of their
respective regions.  It is also shared
by this Court, and by the Regional Trial Court, with the Court of Appeals (formerly,
Intermediate Appellate Court), although prior to the effectivity of 
Batas
Pambansa Bilang 
129 on August 14, 1981, the latterâs competence to issue
the extraordinary writs was restricted to those âin aid of its appellate
jurisdiction.â  This concurrence of
jurisdiction is not, however, to be taken as according to parties seeking any
of the writs an absolute, unrestrained freedom of choice of the court to which
application therefor will be directed.  There is after all a hierarchy of courts.  That hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals, and
should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for
petitions for the extraordinary writs.  A becoming regard for that judicial hierarchy most certainly indicates
that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level (âinferiorâ)
courts should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and those against the
latter, with the Court of Appeals.â (Citations omitted) 


But the Supreme
Court has the full discretionary power to take cognizance of the petition filed
directly to it if compelling reasons, or the nature and importance of the
issues raised, warrant.  This has been
the judicial policy to be observed and which has been reiterated in subsequent
cases, namely:
[50]
 
Uy vs. Contreras, et. al
.,
[51]
 
Torres vs. Arranz
,
[52]
 Bercero vs. De Guzman,
[53]
 and 
Advincula vs. Legaspi, et.
al.
[54]
 As we have further stated in 
Cuaresma
:


âx x x.  A direct invocation of the Supreme Courtâs original jurisdiction
to issue these writs should be allowed only when there are special and
important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the
petition.  This is established policy.  It is a policy that is necessary to prevent
inordinate demands upon the Courtâs time and attention which are better devoted
to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction, and to prevent further
over-crowding of the Courtâs docket.â


Pursuant to said
judicial policy, we resolve to take primary jurisdiction over the present
petition in the interest of speedy justice
[55]
 and to avoid future litigations so
as to promptly put an end to the present controversy which, as correctly
observed by petitioners, has sparked national interest because of the magnitude
of the problem created by the issuance of the assailed resolution.  Moreover, as will be discussed later, we
find the assailed resolution wholly void and requiring the petitioners to file
their petition first with the Court of Appeals would only result in a waste of
time and money.  


That the Court
has the power to set aside its own rules in the higher interests of justice is
well-entrenched in our jurisprudence.  We reiterate what we said in 
Piczon vs. Court of Appeals
:
[56]


âBe it remembered that rules of
procedure are but mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of
justice.  Their strict and rigid
application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather
than promote substantial justice, must always be avoided.  Time and again, this Court has suspended its
own rules and excepted a particular case from their operation whenever the
higher interests of justice so require.  In the instant petition, we forego a lengthy disquisition of the proper
procedure that should have been taken by the parties involved and proceed
directly to the merits of the case."


As to the second
issue of whether the petitioners committed a fatal procedural lapse when they
failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the assailed resolution before
seeking judicial recourse, suffice it to state that the said motion is not
necessary when the questioned resolution is a patent nullity,
[57]
 as will be taken up later.


With respect to
the third issue, the respondents claim that the filing by the petitioners of: (a)
a petition for certiorari, prohibition with preliminary injunction (CA-G.R. SP
No. 37614) with the Court of Appeals; (b) a complaint for annulment and
cancellation of title, damages and injunction against DAR and 141 others (Civil
Case No. 2687-97) with the Regional Trial Court of Malaybalay, Bukidnon; and (c)
the present petition, constitute forum shopping.  


We disagree. 


The rule is
that:


âThere is forum-shopping whenever,
as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable
opinion (other than by appeal or certiorari) in another.  The principle applies not only with respect
to suits filed in the courts but also in connection with litigation commenced
in the courts while an administrative proceeding is pending, as in this case,
in order to defeat administrative processes and in anticipation of an
unfavorable administrative ruling and a favorable court ruling.  This specially so, as in this case, where
the court in which the second suit was brought, has no jurisdiction (citations
omitted).


âThe test for determining whether a
party violated the rule against forum shopping has been laid down in the 1986
case of 
Buan vs. Lopez
 (145 SCRA 34), x x x and that is, 
forum
shopping exists where the elements of 
litis pendentia
 are present or
where a final judgment in one case will amount to
 res judicata
 in the
other
, as follows:


âThere
thus exists between the action before this Court and RTC Case No. 86-36563
identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests
in both actions, as well as 
identity of rights asserted and relief prayed
for
, the relief being founded on the same facts, and the identity on the
two preceding particulars is such that 
any judgment rendered in the other
action, will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to 
res
adjudicata
 in the action under consideration
: all the requisites, in
fine, of 
auter action pendant
.'â
[58]


It is clear from
the above-quoted rule that the petitioners are not guilty of forum
shopping.  The test for determining
whether a party has violated the rule against forum shopping is where a final
judgment in one case will amount to 
res adjudicata
 in the action under
consideration.  A cursory examination of
the cases filed by the petitioners does not show that the said cases are
similar with each other.  The petition
for certiorari in the Court of Appeals sought the nullification of the DAR
Secretaryâs order to proceed with the compulsory acquisition and distribution
of the subject property.  On the other
hand, the civil case in RTC of Malaybalay, Bukidnon for the annulment and
cancellation of title issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines,
with damages, was based on the following grounds:  (1) the DAR, in applying for cancellation of petitioner NQSRMDCâs
title, used documents which were earlier declared null and void by the DARAB; (2)
the cancellation of NQSRMDCâs title was made without payment of just
compensation; and (3) without notice to NQSRMDC for the surrender of its
title.  The present petition is entirely
different from the said two cases as it seeks the nullification of the assailed
âWin-Winâ Resolution of the Office of the President dated November 7, 1997,
which resolution was issued long after the previous two cases were
instituted.  


The fourth and
final preliminary issue to be resolved is the motion for intervention filed by
alleged farmer-beneficiaries, which we have to deny for lack of merit.  In their motion, movants contend that they
are the farmer-beneficiaries of the land in question, hence, are real parties
in interest.  To prove this, they
attached as Annex âIâ in their motion a Master List of
Farmer-Beneficiaries.  Apparently, the
alleged master list was made pursuant to the directive in the dispositive
portion of the assailed âWin-Winâ Resolution which directs the DAR âto
carefully and meticulously determine who among the claimants are qualified
farmer-beneficiaries.â  However, a
perusal of the said document reveals that movants are those purportedly âFound
Qualified and Recommended for Approval.â  In other words, movants are merely 
recommendee

farmer-beneficiaries. 


The rule in this
jurisdiction is that a 
real party in interest
 is a party who would be
benefited or injured by the judgment or is the party entitled to the avails of
the suit.  
Real interest
 means a 
present


substantial
 interest, as distinguished from a mere expectancy or a
future, contingent, subordinate or consequential interest.
[59]
 Undoubtedly, movantsâ interest over
the land in question is a mere expectancy.  Ergo, they are not real parties in interest.


Furthermore, the
challenged resolution upon which movants based their motion is, as intimated
earlier, null and void. Hence, their motion for intervention has no leg to
stand on. 


Now to the main
issue of whether the final and executory Decision dated March 29,1996 can still
be substantially modified by the  âWin-Winâ Resolution. 


We rule in the
negative.


The rules and
regulations governing appeals to the Office of the President of the Philippines
are embodied in Administrative Order No. 18. Section 7 thereof provides:


âSEC. 7.  Decisions/resolutions/orders of the Office of the President
shall, except as otherwise provided for by special laws, 
become final after
the lapse of fifteen (15) days from receipt of a copy thereof
 by the
parties, 
unless a motion for reconsideration thereof is filed within such
period.


â
Only one motion for
reconsideration by any one party shall be allowed
 and entertained, save in
exceptionally meritorious cases.â (Emphasis ours)


It is further provided for in Section 9 that âThe Rules of Court shall
apply in a suppletory character whenever practicable.â


When the Office
of the President issued the Order dated June 23,1997 declaring the Decision of
March 29, 1996 final and executory, as no one has seasonably filed a motion for
reconsideration thereto, the said Office had lost its jurisdiction to re-open
the case, more so modify its Decision. Having lost its jurisdiction, the Office
of the President has no more authority to entertain the 
second
 motion
for reconsideration filed by respondent DAR Secretary, which second motion
became the basis of the assailed âWin-Winâ Resolution. Section 7 of
Administrative Order No. 18 and Section 4, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of
Court mandate that only 
one
 (1) motion for reconsideration is allowed to
be taken from the Decision of March 29, 1996. And even if a second motion for
reconsideration was permitted to be filed in âexceptionally meritorious cases,â
as provided in the second paragraph of Section 7 of AO 18, still the said
motion should not have been entertained considering that the first motion for
reconsideration was not seasonably filed, thereby allowing the Decision of
March 29, 1996 to lapse into finality.  Thus, the act of the Office of the President in re-opening the case and
substantially modifying its March 29,1996 Decision which had already become
final and executory, was in gross disregard of the rules and basic legal
precept that accord 
finality
 to administrative determinations. 


In 
San Luis,
et al.  vs. Court of Appeals, et al
.
[60]
 we held: 


âSince the decisions of both the
Civil Service Commission and the Office of the President had long become final
and executory, the same can no longer be reviewed by the courts. It is
well-established in our jurisprudence that the decisions and orders of
administrative agencies, rendered pursuant to their quasi-judicial authority,
have upon their finality, the force and binding effect of a final judgment
within the purview of the doctrine of 
res judicata 
[Brillantes v.
Castro, 99 Phil. 497 (1956), Ipekdijna Merchandizing Co., Inc. v. Court of Tax
Appeals, G.R. No. L-15430, September 30, 1963, 9 SCRA 72.] The rule of 
res
judicata 
which forbids the reopening of a matter once judicially determined
by competent authority applies as well to the judicial and quasi-judicial acts
of public, executive or administrative officers and boards acting within their
jurisdiction as to the judgments of courts having general judicial powers
[Brillantes v. Castro, 
supra
 at 503].â


The orderly
administration of justice requires that the judgments/resolutions of a court or
quasi-judicial body must reach a point of finality set by the law, rules and
regulations.  The noble purpose is to
write finis to disputes once and for all.
[61]
 This is a fundamental principle in
our justice system, without which there would be no end to litigations.  Utmost respect and adherence to this
principle must always be maintained by those who wield the power of adjudication.  Any act which violates such principle must
immediately be struck down.


Therefore, the
assailed âWin-Winâ Resolution which substantially modified the Decision of
March 29, 1996 after it has attained finality, is utterly void. Such void
resolution, as aptly stressed by Justice Thomas A. Street
[62]
 in a 1918 case,
[63]
 is âa lawless thing, which can be
treated as an outlaw and slain at sight, or ignored wherever and whenever it
exhibits its head.â
[64]


WHEREFORE
, the present petition is hereby
GRANTED. The challenged Resolution dated November 7, 1997, issued by the Office
of the President in OP Case No. 96-C-6424, is hereby NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE.
The Motion For Leave To Intervene filed by alleged farmer-beneficiaries is
hereby DENIED.
