THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 126529, April 15, 1998 ]


EDUARDO B. PRANGAN, PETITIONER,
VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC), MASAGANA SECURITY SERVICES
CORPORATION, AND/OR VICTOR C. PADILLA, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


Private respondent,
a corporation engaged in providing security services to its client, hired
petitioner on November 4, 1980 as one of its security guards.  Thereafter, he was assigned to the Cat House
Bar and Restaurant with a monthly salary of 
P
2,000.00 until its closure
on August 31, 1993.


On May 4, 1994,
petitioner filed a complaint
[1]
 against private respondent for
underpayment of wages, non-payment of salary from August 16-31, 1993, overtime
pay, premium pay for holiday, rest day, night shift differential, uniform
allowance, service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay from the year 1990 to
1993.


Private
respondent, in its position paper,
[2]
 rejected petitionerâs claim
alleging it merely acted as an agent of the latter in securing his employment
at the Cat House Bar and Restaurant.  Thus, the liability for the claims of the petitioner should be charged
to Cat House Bar and its owner, being his direct employer.


In resolving the
dispute in a decision dated May 31, 1995,
[3]
 the Labor Arbiter brushed aside the
private respondentâs contention that it was merely an agent of the petitioner
and concluded:


âWHEREFORE, PREMISES
CONSIDERED, respondents MASAGANA SECURITY SERVICE CORPORATION and/or VICTOR C.
PADILLA are hereby ORDERED to pay within ten (10) days from receipt hereof
herein complainant EDUARDO B. PRANGAN, the total sum of Nine Thousand Nine
Hundred Thirty Two Pesos & Sixteen Centavos (
P
9,932.16) premium pay
for holiday and rest days, night shift differential, service incentive leave
pay, 13th month pay, uniform allowance, and unpaid salary.


Complainantâs other claims
as well as respondentsâ counter claim are hereby DISMISSSED either for the
reason of prescription and/or lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.â


Apparently not
satisfied with the above-mentioned monetary award, petitioner appealed to the
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) contending that the Labor Arbiter
erred in concluding that he only worked for four hours and not twelve hours a
day.  Evidently, the shorter work hours
resulted in a lower monetary award by the Labor Arbiter.  However, the NLRC dismissed his appeal for
failure to file the same within ten-day reglementary period.
[4]


Undaunted,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which, in the âinterest of
justice,â was favorably granted by the NLRC resulting in the reinstatement of
his appeal.  Nonetheless, petitionerâs
victory was short-lived as the NLRC eventually dismissed his appeal for lack of
merit,
[5]
 the dispositive portion of the
decision reads:


âWHEREFORE, the appeal is
hereby dismissed for lack of merit and decision is affirmed 
in toto
.


SO ORDERED.â


Petitioner is
now before us imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent NLRC
(a) declaring that he rendered only four hours and not twelve hours of work,
and (b) affirming the monetary award.


The public
respondent, through the Solicitor General, and the private respondent filed
their respective comments on the petition refuting the allegation of the
petitioner.  Specifically, they asserted
that the decision was supported by ample evidence showing that petitioner
indeed worked for only four hours and not twelve hours a day.


A review of the
alleged error raised by the instant petition leads us to conclude that the same
is factual in nature which, as a rule, we do not pass upon.  As a general rule, it is not for us to
correct the NLRCâs evaluation of the evidence, as our task is confined to
issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
[6]
 Obviously, however, the same will
not apply where the evidence require a reversal or modification.
[7]


As proof of
petitionerâs actual hours of work, private respondent submitted the daily time
records allegedly signed by the petitioner himself showing that he only worked
four hours daily.


In contrast,
petitioner argues that these daily time records were falsified for the simple
reason that he was not required to submit one.  He further stressed that, assuming such documents exist, its
authenticity and due execution are questionable and of doubtful source.


We find merit in
the petition.


To be sure,
findings of fact of quasi-judicial bodies like the NLRC, particularly when they
coincide with those of the Labor Arbiter, are accorded with respect even
finality if supported by substantial evidence.
[8]
 In this regard, we have defined
substantial evidence as such amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable
mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.
[9]
 Absent such quantum of evidence,
the Court is not precluded from making its own independent evaluation of facts.
[10]


In the instant
case, there is no dispute that matters concerning an employeeâs actual hours of
work are within the ambit of management prerogative.  However, when an employer alleges that his employee works less
than the normal hours of employment as provided for in the law,
[11]
 he bears the burden of proving his
allegation with clear and satisfactory evidence.


In the instant
petition, the NLRC, in declaring that petitioner only worked for four hours,
relied solely on the supposed daily time records of the petitioner submitted by
the private respondent.
[12]
 We, however, are of the opinion
that these documents cannot be considered substantial evidence as to conclude
that petitioner only worked for four hours.  It is worth mentioning that petitioner, in his Sur-Rejoinder to
Respondentsâ Rejoinder,
[13]
 unequivocably stated that:


âComplainant (petitioner
herein) never made nor submitted any daily time record with respondent company
considering the fact that he was assigned to a single post and that the daily
time records he allegedly submitted with respondent company are all falsified
and his signature appearing therein forged.â


Private
respondent hardly bothered to controvert petitionerâs assertion, much less
bolster its own contention.  As
petitionerâs employer, private respondent has unlimited access to all relevant
documents and records on the hours of work of the petitioner.  Yet, even as it insists that petitioner only
worked for four hours and not twelve, no employment contract, payroll, notice
of assignment or posting, cash voucher or any other convincing evidence which
may attest to the actual hours of work of the petitioner were even
presented.  Instead, what the private
respondent offered as evidence were only petitionerâs daily time record, which
the latter categorically denied ever accomplishing, much less signing.


In said alleged
daily time record, it showed that petitioner started work at 10:00 p.m. and
would invariably leave his post at exactly 2:00 a.m.  Obviously, such unvarying recording of a daily time record is
improbable and contrary to human experience.  It is impossible for an employee to arrive at the workplace and leave at
exactly the same time, day in day out.  The very uniformity and regularity of the entries are âbadges of
untruthfulness and as such indices of dubiety.
[14]


Another consideration
which militates against private respondentâs claim is the fact that in the
personnel data sheet of the petitioner,
[15]
 duly signed by the formerâs
operation manager, it shows on its face that the latterâs hours of work are
from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. or twelve hours a day.  Hence, private respondent is estopped from assailing the contents
of its own documents.


Further, the
attendance sheets of Cat House Bar and Restaurant
[16]
 showed that petitioner worked from
7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. daily, documents which were never repudiated by the
private respondent.


All told,
private respondent has not adequately proved that petitionerâs actual hours of
work is only four hours.  Its
unexplained silence contravening the personnel data sheet and the attendance
sheets of Cat House Bar and Restaurant presented by the petitioner showing he
worked for twelve hours, has assumed the character of an admission.  No reason was proffered for this silence
despite private respondent, being the employer, could have easily done so.


As is
well-settled, if doubts exist between the evidence presented by the employer
and the employee, the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the
employee.  Since it is a time-honored
rule that in controversies between a laborer and his master, doubts reasonably
arising from the evidence, or in the interpretation of agreements and writings
should be resolved in the formerâs favor.
[17]


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the
instant petition is hereby GRANTED.  Accordingly, the decision of the NLRC dated July 31, 1996 is hereby
VACATED.  Whatever money claims due to
the petitioner shall be computed on the basis of a twelve-hour daily work
schedule.  For this purpose, the case is
hereby REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for immediate recomputation of said claims
in accordance with the foregoing findings.  No costs.
