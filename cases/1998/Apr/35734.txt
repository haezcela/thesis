JUDY PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER,
VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND VIRGINIA ANTIOLA, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




MARTINEZ, J.:


This petition
for 
certiorari
 assails the Decision
[1]
 dated June 30, 1993 of the National
Labor Relations Commission ordering petitioner to reinstate private respondent
Virginia Antiola, with one year backwages; and the Order
[2]
 dated August 30, 1993 denying the
motion for reconsideration. The challenged ruling reversed the decision dated
April 26, 1990 of Labor Arbiter Arturo V. Casuco dismissing the complaint for
unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal for lack of merit.
[3]


The facts which
gave rise to this petition are as follows:


Virginia Antiola was employed by
petitioner Judy Philippines, Inc. in the latterâs export business since January
1985. In the course of such employment, she worked as an assorter of baby
infant dresses with a daily salary of 
P
69.00 up to January 11, 1989.


On November 15, 1988, Virginia
Antiola was directed by Marietta Elizon, her supervisor, to sort out baby
infant dresses pursuant to an instruction sheet.


On January 4, 1989, petitioner,
thru its Personnel Manager, Mrs. Lolita Agus, required private respondent to
explain in writing why she should not be meted disciplinary sanctions for her
erroneous assortment and packaging of 2,680 dozens of infant wear.  On the same day, she submitted her written
explanation, admitting her error and pleading that 
âKaya inihihingi ko po
nang paumanhin ang aking pagkakamali.â
[4]


Similarly on January 24, 1989,
Marietta Elizon, private respondentâs supervisor and Ester Rellesiva, the
packer, received a memo requiring them  to explain why they  should not
be penalized. Marietta Elizon submitted her explanation on February 2, 1989
[5]
 
and Ester Rellesiva on
January 25, 1989.
[6]


Petitioner found private respondent
guilty of negligence and she was dismissed from employment effective January
11, 1989.  Marietta Elizon, on the
other  hand, was suspended  from  employment for one (1) month effective February 12, 1989 on the ground
of negligence through command responsibility. Ester Rellesiva was found
innocent on the ground that when she undertook the packing of the infant wear,
the same were already sealed in black plastic bags and could no longer be
checked. 


The National Federation of Labor
Union (NAFLU), in behalf of  Virginia
Antiola, filed a complaint for unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal
against  Judy Philippines, Inc. and  Lolita Z. Agus.  


NAFLU alleged that the dismissal of
Virginia Antiola was unjustified because the infant wear erroneously assorted
by Antiola should not have been shipped to the buyer had the companyâs
supervisor and the buyerâs quality comptroller exercised due diligence in the
performance of their duties in ensuring that the goods were properly
assorted.  NAFLU assert that the act of
petitioner in dismissing private respondent Antiola is a manipulative scheme
designed to support its deliberate attempt to get rid of her from the service.


Petitioner countered that instead
of following the written instruction of her supervisor, private respondent
deviated therefrom which resulted in erroneous packaging of the infant wear.
Thus, petitioner, avers that the dismissal of  private respondent Antiola was valid and lawful, premised on the ground
of negligence.


The Labor
Arbiterâs decision rendered on April 26, 1990 found the dismissal justified, 
viz:


âUpon careful study and perusal of
the entire records of the instant case this office is inclined to uphold the
act of the petitioner on dismissing individual complainant, as lawful, premise
on the ground of fault and negligence causing an irreparable damage to the
goodwill of the petitionersâ business, especially considering that the latter
is an export oriented entity. For more than one and one half months (1 1/2)
from November 15, 1988 up to January 4, 1989 while she, individual complainant,
was in the process of sorting the finished products she failed to notice the
errors she had been committing. She had neglected her duty to check for herself
her accomplishment whether or not it tallys with the written instruction of her
supervisor in her possession. She admitted in her own written admission that
she failed to check her errors and that she really committed the erroneous
assortment since the very beginning.


The claim of complainants that the
act of  petitioner in dismissing
individual claimant is discriminatory, tainted with unfair labor practice, on
the ground that supervisor, Marietta Elizon, was made to suffer only one month
suspension while individual claimant was punished too severely by dismissal, is
untenable. The degree of responsibility between individual claimant and her
supervisor can not be the same. The wrongful act was committed by complainant
while her supervisor was merely remiss of her duty to  supervise complainant. In the case of Edwin Estabillo, the
buyerâs quality controller, he is checking the quality of the infants wear and
not the specification. In addition, he is not an employee of the herein  petitioner under which the latter may impose
appropriate discipline.


Concerning complainants claim that
Virginia Antiola was not accorded due process before she was dismissed, records
show that complainant Antiola was required to explain in writing within (20)
hours why she should not be meted any disciplinary action for her negligence,
that of having assorted the goods erroneously and contrary to the instruction
given her. Complainant Antiola in compliance with the memorandum, submitted her
written admission of guilt, which in turn became the basis of the petitioner in
terminating her service. On the basis of the foregoing circumstance, this Labor
Arbiter is of the view that due process mandated under B.P. 130 is
substantially satisfied. There is no need for a hearing because herein
individual claimant has pleaded guilty. 


While it is true that individual
complainant has committed the infraction for the first time, as the records
will show, and that she has voluntarily admitted guilt, it could not likewise
be denied that respondent company suffered substantial losses brought about by
individual complainantâs wrongful act. She should have  checked her accomplishment against the
written instruction of her supervisor, before turning over the same to the
packer for the packing. Let it be recalled that before turning over the
assorted goods to the packer, it  is
already packed in  black plastic bags
presumably by individual complainant herself. Regrettably, the latter failed to
exercise due diligence in the performance of her assigned tasks. Much as we are
bound to uphold the right of workers to security of tenure, we cannot, as in
this case, deny capital its prerogative to exercise its inherent power to
discipline its workers.


WHEREFORE, premises considered, let
the instant case be, as it is hereby  DISMISSED for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED
.â
[7]


Private
respondent appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission.  In reversing the decision of the labor
arbiter, the NLRC said that:


âThe most, 
arguendo
, that
may be said against complainant here is that in failing  âto exercise due diligence in the
performance of her assigned task(s),â she committed âGross xxx neglectâ in the
performance of her duty.  But
pertinently, Article 282(b) of the Labor Code requires that to qualify as a
valid cause for dismissal such neglect must not only be gross, it should be
âGross and habitual neglectâ in character. 


Noting that the Labor Arbiter,
himself admits that âindividual complainant has committed the infraction for
the first time, as the records will showâ (Decision, p.6 Record, p. 54), we
thus rule that the penalty of dismissal is quite severe here.


Against the backdrop that the
complainant was dismissed on January 12, 1989 and has been deprived by
petitioner company of wages for about three years and four months, we opine
that an award of reinstatement plus one year backwages will  suffice.


WHEREFORE,  the appealed  decision is hereby set aside.  The respondents are hereby directed to reinstate complainant with backwages
limited to one year.


SO ORDERED.
â
[8]


Petitionerâs
motion for reconsideration and/or appeal was denied  in an Order dated August 30, 1993.  


Hence, this
petition for review, the petitioner contending that: 


I


THE NLRC SERIOUSLY
ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW, IN NOT HOLDING THAT UNDER ARTICLE 223 OF THE LABOR
CODE THE APPEAL FILED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT TO THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS
COMMISSION FROM THE DECISION OF LABOR ARBITER ARTURO V. CASUCO WAS FILED BEYOND
THE REGLEMENTARY PERIOD AND THAT THE SAID DECISION OF LABOR ARBITER CASUCO HAD
ALREADY BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.


II


ASSUMING
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT THE DECISION OF LABOR ARBITER ARTURO CASUCO HAD
NOT YET BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY AND THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTâS APPEAL COULD
BE ENTERTAINED, THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION SERIOUSLY ERRED AS A
MATTER OF LAW IN HOLDING THAT THE OFFENSE COMMITTED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT DID
NOT CONSTITUTE A JUST CAUSE FOR DISMISSAL UNDER ARTICLE 282 OF THE LABOR CODE.


On the question
of whether or not the appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission had
been seasonably made, we rule in favor of  private respondent. 


Petitioner
contends that  private respondent
received a copy of the Decision of Labor Arbiter Arturo Casuco on  May 2, 1990. She had therefore, ten calendar
days therefrom, or until May 12, 1990, to file her appeal to the NLRC. However,
she filed her appeal only on May 14, 1990, or two days beyond the reglementary
period.
[9]
 Petitioner points out that the
appeal was filed out of time and should be dismissed. 


It is admitted
that private respondent Antiola received the labor arbiterâs decision  on May 2, 1990. Under Article 223 of  the Labor Code, as amended, the period to
appeal to the Commission is ten (10) calendar days, to wit:


Article  223. Appeal. - Decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter
are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both
parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards or
orders.


x x x x x.â


Since the 10-day
period provided in Article 223 of the Labor Code  refers  to  ten  calendar  days  and  not  to  ten  working days, this
means that Saturdays, Sundays and Legal Holidays are not to be excluded, but
included,  in the computation of the
10-day period. This is in line with the objective of the law for speedy
disposition of labor cases with the end in view of protecting the interest of
the working man.
[10]
 In subsequent cases, We ruled that
if the tenth day to perfect an appeal from the decision of the Labor Arbiter to
the NLRC falls on a Saturday, the appeal shall be made on the next working day,
[11]
 as embodied in Section 1, Rule VI
of the NLRC Rules of Procedure promulgated on January 14, 1992. This conclusion
arrived at by the Court  recognizes  the fact that on Saturdays the offices
of  NLRC  and certain post offices are  closed.  


Private
respondent filed her appeal on the twelfth calendar day following receipt of
the copy of the labor arbiterâs decision, since the tenth day, May 12, 1990, is
a Saturday.
[12]
 Following the above enunciated
doctrine, the filing of the appeal on May 14, 1990, the next working day, is
considered to be within the reglementary period provided for by law, hence,
seasonably made.


Even assuming 
arguendo

that the appeal was filed beyond the period allowed by law, We have at times
overlooked this particular procedural lapse. In the case of Firestone Tire and
Rubber Co. v. Larosa
[13]
 and reiterated in Chong Guan
Trading vs. NLRC
[14]
 this Court allowed the filing of  appeals from the decisions of the labor
arbiter to the NLRC, even if filed beyond the reglementary period, in the
interest of justice. Thus,  technical
rules of  procedure in labor cases are
not to be strictly applied if the result would be detrimental to the working
man.
[15]
 Technicality should not be
permitted to stand in the way of equitably and completely resolving  the rights and obligations of the parties.
[16]
 Moreover, under Article 218 (c) of
the Labor Code, the Commission is empowered to âcorrect, amend, or waive any
error, defect or irregularity whether in substance or form,â in the exercise of
its appellate jurisdiction.  Therefore,  We find  no grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the  NLRC  in entertaining  the
appeal of private respondents, even if, as alleged by petitioner, it was filed
two days late.  


The Constitution
guarantees the right of workers to âsecurity of tenure.â
[17]
 In upholding the same, Article 277
(b) in relation to Section 1 of Rule XIV (Book Five) of the Labor Code,
requires the existence of  a valid
cause  to justify the  termination of  an employee. Without a valid cause,  dismissal  of employees
may  not properly be done.


While it is true
that  the decision to dismiss or lay off
an employee is managementâs prerogative, it must be made  without abuse of discretion, for what is at
stake is not only the employeeâs position but also his means of livelihood.
[18]
 Therefore, he should be protected
against any arbitrary deprivation of his job.
[19]
 At any rate, where a penalty less
punitive would suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not
to be visited with a consequence so severe. It is not only because of the lawâs
concern for the  workingmen. There is,
in addition, his family to consider. Unemployment brings about hardships and
sorrows on those dependent on the wage-earner. The misery and pain attendant to
the loss of jobs then could be avoided if there be acceptance of the view that
under all circumstances of a case the workers should not be deprived of their
means of livelihood
.
[20]


Petitioner
anchors its right to terminate the employment of Virginia Antiola on the ground
of  âgross neglect of duties,â under
Article 282 (b) of the Labor Code. 
Gross negligence
 implies a want or
absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire
absence of care. It evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without
exerting any effort to avoid them.
[21]


We affirm the
finding of the  NLRC that  âArticle 282 (b) of the Labor Code requires
that  xxx  such neglect must not only be gross, it  should be â
Gross
 
and habitual
 
neglect
â
 
  in character.â As aptly pronounced by  the NLRC,  â
the penalty of  dismissal  is  quite  severe here
â  noting  that the labor arbiter himself admits  that she committed the infraction for the
first  time. 


  Considering that private  respondent worked with the company for four
years with no known previous bad record,  the ends  of  social and compassionate justice would be
better served if she  was merely
suspended from work rather than terminated. 


  We are not, however, unmindful of the
negligence committed by  respondent
Antiola. The employerâs obligation to give his workers just compensation and
treatment carries with it the corollary right to expect from the workers
adequate work, diligence and good conduct. Nonetheless, private respondentâs
wrongdoing  does not warrant dismissal
inasmuch as dismissal is the ultimate  penalty that can be meted to an employee.
[22]


In view of the
foregoing, We rule that Judy Philippines, Inc. had no valid cause to dispense
with the services of  private
respondent. 


We shall now
deal with  the consequences that should
visit the petitioner for illegally dismissing private respondent Virginia
Antiola.


Under the law,
[23]
 an employee  is entitled to reinstatement and to his full
backwages when he is unjustly dismissed. Note, however, that reinstatement and
backwages are separate and distinct reliefs given to an illegally dismissed
employee.
[24]


Reinstatement
means restoration to a state or condition from which one had been removed or
separated.
[25]
 One who is reinstated assumes the
position he had occupied prior to the dismissal and is, as an ordinary rule,
entitled only to the last salary in that position.
[26]


Backwages, on
the other hand, is a form of relief that restores the income that was lost by
reason of unlawful dismissal.
[27]


Public
respondent NLRC deemed it proper to order the reinstatement of private
respondent Virginia Antiola. We find no cogent reason to set aside public
respondentâs findings on this matter. Be  that  as   it  may, we  cannot sustain the
ruling of  public respondent in awarding
backwages limited to one year. 


Republic Act No.
6715, which took effect on March 21, 1989, amended  Article 279 of the Labor Code,  provides that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to full
backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other  benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his
compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.
[28]
 We  have  ruled,  however,  that  this  amendment  has no retroactive effect. In such case, the award of backwages to an
employee whose illegal dismissal occurred before  March 21, 1989, is limited to  a period of three (3) years without deduction or qualification.
[29]


Following the
above enunciated doctrine, the dismissal  of Virginia Antiola having been effected on January 11, 1989,  entitles her to backwages for a period of
three (3) years, without deduction or qualification.


WHEREFORE
, the decision  of public respondent National Labor Relations
Commission dated  June 30, 1993 is
hereby AFFIRMED subject, however, to  modification that petitioner Judy Philippines, Inc. be ordered to pay
private respondent Virginia Antiola backwages for a period of three (3) years,
without qualification or deduction.
