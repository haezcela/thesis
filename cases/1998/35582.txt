ASSOCIATION OF PHILIPPINE
COCONUT DESICCATORS, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE COCONUT AUTHORITY, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


At issue in this
case is the validity of a resolution, dated March 24, 1993, of the Philippine
Coconut Authority in which it declares that it will no longer require those
wishing to engage in coconut processing to apply to it for a license or permit
as a condition for engaging in such business.


Petitioner
Association of Philippine Coconut Desiccators (hereafter referred to as APCD)
brought this suit for 
certiorari
 and 
mandamus
 against respondent Philippine
Coconut Authority (PCA) to invalidate the latterâs Board Resolution No. 018-93
and the certificates of registration issued under it on the ground that the
resolution in question is beyond the power of the PCA to adopt, and to compel
said administrative agency to comply instead with the mandatory provisions of
statutes regulating the desiccated coconut industry, in particular, and the
coconut industry, in general.


As disclosed by the partiesâ pleadings, the facts are as
follows:


On
November 5, 1992, seven desiccated coconut processing companies belonging to
the APCD brought suit in the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial
Region in Makati, Metro Manila, to enjoin the  PCA from issuing permits to certain applicants for the establishment of
new desiccated coconut processing plants. Petitioner alleged that the issuance
of licenses to the applicants would violate PCAâs Administrative Order No. 02,
series of 1991, as the applicants were seeking permits to operate in areas
considered âcongestedâ under the administrative order.
[1]


On
November 6, 1992, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order and, on
November 25, 1992, a writ of preliminary injunction, enjoining the PCA from
processing and issuing licenses to Primex Products, Inc., Coco Manila,
Superstar (Candelaria) and Superstar (Davao) upon the posting of a bond in the
amount of 
P
100,000.00.
[2]


Subsequently and
while the case was pending in the Regional Trial Court, the Governing Board of
the PCA issued on March 24, 1993 Resolution No. 018-93, providing for the
withdrawal of the Philippine Coconut Authority from all regulation of the
coconut product processing industry.  While it continues the registration of coconut product processors, the
registration would be limited to the âmonitoringâ of their volumes of
production and administration of quality standards.  The full text of the resolution reads:


RESOLUTION NO. 018-93


POLICY DECLARATION DEREGULATING


THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COCONUT


PROCESSING PLANTS


WHEREAS, it is the policy of the
State to promote free enterprise unhampered by protective regulations and
unnecessary bureaucratic red tapes;


WHEREAS, the deregulation of
certain sectors of the coconut industry, such as marketing of coconut oils
pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1960, the lifting of export and commodity
clearances under Executive Order No. 1016, and relaxation of regulated capacity
for the desiccated coconut sector pursuant to Presidential Memorandum of
February 11, 1988, has become a centerpiece of the present dispensation;


WHEREAS, the issuance of permits or
licenses prior to business operation is a form of regulation which is not
provided in the charter of nor included among the powers of the PCA;


WHEREAS, the Governing Board of PCA
has determined to follow and further support the deregulation policy and effort
of the government to promote free enterprise;


NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT
IS HEREBY RESOLVED, that, henceforth, PCA shall no longer require any coconut
oil mill, coconut oil refinery, coconut desiccator, coconut product
processor/factory, coconut fiber plant or any similar coconut processing plant
to apply with PCA and the latter shall no longer issue any form of license or
permit as condition prior to establishment or operation of such mills or
plants;


RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the PCA
shall limit itself only to simply registering the aforementioned coconut
product processors for the purpose of monitoring their volumes of production,
administration of quality standards with the corresponding service
fees/charges.


ADOPTED this 24th day of March 1993, at Quezon City.
[3]


The PCA then
proceeded to issue âcertificates of registrationâ to those wishing to operate
desiccated coconut processing plants, prompting  petitioner to appeal to the Office of the President of the
Philippines on April 26, 1993 not to approve the resolution in question.  Despite follow-up letters sent on May 25 and
June 2, 1993, petitioner received no reply from the Office of the
President.  The  âcertificates of registrationâ issued in the
meantime by the PCA has enabled a number of new coconut mills to operate.  Hence this petition. 


Petitioner alleges:  


I


RESPONDENT PCAâS BOARD RESOLUTION NO. 018-93 IS NULL
AND VOID FOR BEING AN UNDUE EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE
BODY.


II


ASIDE FROM BEING ULTRA-VIRES, BOARD RESOLUTION NO.
018-93 IS WITHOUT ANY BASIS, ARBITRARY, UNREASONABLE AND THEREFORE IN VIOLATION
OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS OF LAW.


III


IN PASSING BOARD RESOLUTION NO. 018-93, RESPONDENT PCA VIOLATED THE
PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENT OF CONSULTATION PROVIDED IN PRESIDENTIAL
DECREE NO. 1644, EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 826 AND PCA ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 002,
SERIES OF 1991.


On the other
hand, in addition to answering petitionerâs arguments, respondent PCA alleges
that this petition should be denied on the ground that petitioner has a pending
appeal before the Office of the President.  Respondent accuses petitioner of forum-shopping in filing this petition and
of failing to exhaust available administrative remedies before coming to this
Court.  Respondent anchors its argument
on the general rule that one who brings an action under Rule 65 must show that
one has no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law.  


I.


The rule of
requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before a party may seek
judicial review, so strenuously urged by the Solicitor General on behalf of
respondent, has obviously no application here.  The resolution in question was issued by the PCA in the exercise of its
rule- making or legislative power.  However, only judicial review of decisions of administrative agencies
made in the exercise of their quasi-judicial function is subject to the
exhaustion doctrine.  The exhaustion
doctrine stands as a bar to an action which is not yet complete
[4]
 and it is clear, in the case at
bar,  that after its promulgation the
resolution of the PCA abandoning regulation of the desiccated coconut industry
became effective.  To be sure, the PCA
is under the direct supervision of the President of the Philippines but there
is nothing in P.D. No. 232, P.D. No. 961, P.D. No. 1468 and P.D. No. 1644
defining the powers and functions of the PCA which requires rules and
regulations issued by it to be approved by the President before they become
effective.


In any event,
although the APCD has appealed the resolution in question to the Office of the
President, considering the fact that two months after they had sent their first
letter on April 26, 1993 they still had to hear from the Presidentâs office,
meanwhile respondent PCA was issuing certificates of registration
indiscriminately to new coconut millers, we hold that petitioner was justified
in filing this case on June 25, 1993.
[5]
 Indeed, after writing the Office of
the President on April 26, 1993
[6]
 petitioner sent inquiries to that
office not once, but twice, on May 26, 1993
[7]
 and on June 2, 1993,
[8]
 but petitioner did not receive any
reply.  


II.


We now turn to
the merit of the present petition.  The
Philippine Coconut Authority was originally created by P.D. No. 232 on June 30,
1973, to take over the powers and functions of the Coconut Coordinating
Council, the Philippine Coconut Administration and the Philippine Coconut
Research Institute.  On June 11, 1978,
by P.D. No. 1468, it was made âan independent public corporation . . . directly
reporting to, and supervised by, the President of the Philippines,â
[9]
 and charged with carrying out the
Stateâs policy âto promote the rapid integrated development and growth of the
coconut and other palm oil industry in all its aspects and to ensure that the
coconut farmers become direct participants in, and beneficiaries of, such
development and growth.â
[10]
 through a regulatory scheme set up
by law.
[11]


Through this
scheme, the government, on August 28, 1982, temporarily prohibited the opening
of new coconut processing plants and, four months later, phased out some of the
existing ones in view of overproduction in the coconut industry which resulted
in cut-throat competition, underselling and smuggling of poor quality products
and ultimately in the decline of the export performance of coconut-based
commodities. The establishment of new plants could be authorized only upon
determination by the PCA of the existence of certain economic conditions and the
approval of the President of the Philippines.  Thus,  Executive Order No. 826,
dated August 28, 1982,  provided:


  SECTION 1. 
Prohibition.
 - Except as herein provided, no
government agency or instrumentality shall hereafter authorize, approve or
grant any permit or license for the establishment or operation of new
desiccated coconut processing plants, including the importation of machinery or
equipment for the purpose.  In the event
of a need to establish a new plant, or expand the capacity, relocate or upgrade
the efficiencies of any existing desiccated plant, the Philippine Coconut
Authority may, upon proper determination of such need and evaluation of the
condition relating to:


a. the existing market demand;


b. the
production capacity prevailing in the country or locality;


c. the
level and flow of raw materials; and


d. other
circumstances which may affect the growth or viability of the industry
concerned,


authorize
or grant the application for, the establishment or expansion of capacity, relocation
or upgrading of efficiencies of such desiccated coconut processing plant,
subject to the approval of the President.


On December 6,
1982, a phase-out of some of the existing plants was ordered by the government
after finding that âa mere freeze in the present capacity of existing plants
will not afford a viable solution to the problem considering that the total
available limited market is not adequate to support all the existing processing
plants, making it imperative to reduce the number of existing processing
plants.â
[12]
 Accordingly, it was ordered:
[13]


SECTION 1. The Philippine Coconut
Authority is hereby ordered to take such action as may be necessary to reduce
the number of existing desiccated coconut processing plants to a level which
will insure the survival of the remaining plants.  The Authority is hereby directed to determine which of the
existing processing plants should be phased out and to enter into appropriate
contracts with such plants for the above purpose.


It was only on
October 23, 1987 when the PCA adopted Resolution No. 058-87, authorizing the
establishment and operation of additional DCN plants, in view of the increased
demand for desiccated coconut products in the worldâs markets, particularly in
Germany, the Netherlands and Australia.  Even then, the opening of new plants was made subject to âsuch
implementing guidelines to be set forth by the Authorityâ and âsubject to the
final approval of the President.â


The guidelines
promulgated by the PCA, as embodied in Administrative Order No. 002, series of
1991, inter alia authorized the opening of new plants in ânon-congested areas
only as declared by the PCAâ and subject to compliance by applicants with âall
procedures and requirements for registration under Administrative Order No. 003,
series of 1981 and this Order.â In addition, as the opening of new plants was
premised on the increased global demand for desiccated coconut products, the
new entrants were required to submit sworn statements of the names and
addresses of prospective foreign buyers.


This form of
âderegulationâ was approved by President Aquino in her memorandum, dated
February 11, 1988,  to the PCA.  Affirming the regulatory scheme,  the President stated in her memorandum:  


It appears that pursuant to
Executive Order No. 826 providing measures for the protection of the Desiccated
Coconut Industry, the Philippine Coconut Authority evaluated the conditions
relating to:  (a) the existing market
demands; (b) the production capacity prevailing in the country or locality; (c)
the level and flow of raw materials; and (d) other circumstances which may
affect the growth or viability of the industry concerned and that the result of
such evaluation favored the expansion of production and market of desiccated
coconut products.


In view hereof and
the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, the deregulation
of the Desiccated Coconut Industry as recommended in Resolution No. 058-87
adopted by the PCA Governing Board on October 28, 1987 (
sic
) is hereby
approved.
[14]


These measures  â  the restriction in 1982 on entry into the field, the reduction the same
year of the number of the existing coconut mills and then the lifting of the
restrictions in 1987 â were adopted within the framework of regulation as
established by law âto promote the rapid integrated development and growth of
the coconut and other palm oil industry in all its aspects and to ensure that
the coconut farmers become direct participants in, and beneficiaries of, such
development and growth.â
[15]
 Contrary to the assertion in the
dissent, the power given to the Philippine Coconut Authority â and before it to
the Philippine Coconut Administration â  âto formulate and adopt a general program of development for the coconut
and other palm oils industryâ
[16]
 is not a roving commission to adopt
any program deemed necessary to promote the development of the coconut and
other palm oils industry, but one to be exercised in the context of this
regulatory structure. 


In plain
disregard of this legislative purpose, the PCA adopted on March 24, 1993 the
questioned resolution which allows not only the indiscriminate opening of new
coconut processing plants but the virtual dismantling of the regulatory
infrastructure whereby, forsaking controls theretofore placed in its keeping,
the PCA limits its function to the innocuous one of âmonitoringâ compliance by
coconut millers with quality standards and volumes of production.  In effect, the PCA would simply be compiling
statistical data on these matters, but in case of violations of standards there
would be nothing much it would do.  The
field would be left without an umpire who would retire to the bleachers to
become a mere spectator.  As the PCA
provided in its Resolution No. 018-93:


NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS
IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, that, henceforth, PCA shall no longer require any
coconut oil mill, coconut oil refinery, coconut desiccator, coconut product
processor/factory, coconut fiber plant or any similar coconut processing plant
to apply with PCA and the latter shall no longer issue any form of license or
permit as condition prior to establishment or operation of such mills or
plants;


RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the PCA
shall limit itself only to simply registering the aforementioned coconut
product processors for the purpose of monitoring their volumes of production,
administration of quality standards with the corresponding service
fees/charges.


The issue is not
whether the PCA has the power to adopt this resolution to carry out its mandate
under the law âto promote the accelerated growth and development of the coconut
and other palm oil industry.â
[17]
 The issue rather is whether it can
renounce the power to regulate implicit in the law creating it for that is what
the resolution in question actually is.


  Under Art. II, Â§3(a) of the Revised Coconut
Code (P.D. No. 1468), the role of the PCA is âTo formulate and adopt a general
program of development for the coconut and other palm oil industry in all its
aspects.â  By limiting the purpose of
registration to merely âmonitoring volumes of production [and] administration
of quality standardsâ of coconut processing plants, the PCA in effect abdicates
its role and leaves it almost completely to market forces how the coconut
industry will develop.


Art. II, Â§3 of
P.D. No. 1468 further requires the PCA:  


(h) To regulate the marketing and
the exportation of copra and its by-products by establishing standards for
domestic trade and export and, thereafter, to conduct an inspection of all
copra and its by-products proposed for export to determine if they conform to
the standards established;


Instead of determining  the
qualifications of market players and preventing the entry into the field of
those who are unfit, the PCA now relies entirely on competition â with all its
wastefulness and inefficiency â to do the weeding out, in its naive belief in
survival of the fittest.  The result can
very well be a repeat of 1982 when free enterprise degenerated into a
âfree-for-all,â resulting in cut-throat competition, underselling, the
production of inferior products and the like, which badly affected the foreign
trade performance of the coconut industry.


Indeed, by
repudiating its role in the regulatory scheme, the PCA has put at risk other
statutory provisions, particularly those of P.D. No. 1644, to wit:


Section 1. The Philippine Coconut
Authority shall have full power and authority to regulate the marketing and
export of copra, coconut oil and their by-products, in furtherance of the steps
being taken to rationalize the coconut oil milling industry.


Sec 2.  In the exercise of its powers under Section 1 hereof, the
Philippine Coconut Authority may initiate and implement such measures as may be
necessary to attain the rationalization of the coconut oil milling industry,
including, but not limited to, the following measures:


(a) Imposition of floor and /or ceiling prices for
all exports of copra, coconut oil and their by-products;


(b)
Prescription of quality standards;


(c)
Establishment of maximum quantities for particular periods and particular
markets;


(d) Inspection
and survey of export shipments through an independent international
superintendent or surveyor.


In the exercise of its powers
hereunder, the Philippine Coconut Authority shall consult with, and be guided by,
the recommendation of the coconut farmers, through corporations owned or
controlled by them through the Coconut Industry Investment Fund and the private
corporation authorized to be organized under Letter of Instructions No. 926.


and the Revised Coconut Code (P.D. No. 1468), Art. II, Â§3, to wit:


(m) Except in respect of entities
owned or controlled by the Government or by the coconut farmers under Sections
9 and 10, Article III hereof, the Authority shall have full power and authority
to regulate the production, distribution and utilization of all subsidized
coconut-based products, and to require the submission of such reports or
documents as may be deemed necessary by the Authority to ascertain whether the
levy payments and/or subsidy claims are due and correct and whether the
subsidized products are distributed among, and utilized by, the consumers
authorized by the Authority.


The dissent
seems to be saying that in the same way that restrictions on entry into the
field were imposed in 1982 and then relaxed in 1987, they can be totally lifted
now without prejudice to reimposing them in the future should it become
necessary to do so.  There is really no
renunciation of the power to regulate, it is claimed.  Trimming down of PCAâs function to registration is not an
abdication of the power to regulate but is regulation itself.  But how can this be done when, under
Resolution No. 018-93, the PCA no longer requires a license as condition for
the establishment or operation of a plant?  If a number of processing firms go to areas  which are already congested, the PCA cannot stop them from doing
so.  If there is overproduction, the PCA
cannot order a cut back in their production.  This is because the licensing system is the mechanism for
regulation.  Without it the PCA will not
be able to regulate coconut plants or mills.  


In the first
âwhereasâ clause of the questioned resolution as set out above, the PCA invokes
a policy of free enterprise that is âunhampered by protective regulations and
unnecessary bureaucratic red tapeâ as justification for abolishing the
licensing system.  There can be no
quarrel with the elimination of âunnecessary red tape.â  That is within the power of the PCA to do
and indeed it should eliminate red tape.  Its success in doing so will be applauded.  But free enterprise does not call for removal of âprotective
regulations.â  


Our
Constitutions, beginning with the 1935 document, have repudiated 
laissez-faire

as an economic principle.
[18]
 Although the present Constitution
enshrines free enterprise as a policy,
[19]
 it nonetheless reserves to the
government the power to intervene whenever necessary to promote the general
welfare.  This is clear from the
following provisions of Art. XII of the Constitution which, so far as pertinent,
state:


Sec. 6. . . . Individuals and
private groups, including corporations, cooperatives, and similar collective
organizations, shall have the right to own, establish, and operate economic
enterprises, 
subject to the duty of the State to promote distributive
justice and to intervene when the common good so demands
.  


Sec. 19.  The State shall regulate or prohibit monopolies 
when the
public interest so requires
.  No
combinations in restraint of trade or unfair competition shall be allowed.  (Emphasis added)


At all events, any
change in policy must be made by the legislative department of the
government.  The regulatory system has
been set up by law.  It is beyond the
power of an administrative agency to dismantle it.  Indeed, petitioner charges the PCA of seeking to render moot a
case filed by some of its members questioning the grant of licenses to certain
parties by adopting the resolution in question.  It is alleged that members of petitioner complained to the court
that the PCA had authorized the establishment and operation of new plants in
areas which were already crowded, in violation of its Administrative Order No.
002, series of 1991.  In response,  the Regional Trial Court issued a writ of
preliminary injunction, enjoining  the
PCA from issuing licenses to the private respondents in that case.  


These
allegations of petitioner have not been denied here.  It would thus seem that instead of defending its decision to
allow new entrants into the field against petitionerâs claim that the PCA
decision violated the guidelines in Administrative Order No. 002, series of
1991, the PCA adopted the resolution in question to render the case moot.  In so doing, the PCA abdicated its function
of regulation and left the field to untrammeled competition that is likely to
resurrect the evils of cut-throat competition, underselling and overproduction
which in 1982 required the temporary closing of the field to new players in
order to save the industry.  


The PCA cannot
rely on the memorandum of then President Aquino for authority to adopt the
resolution in question.  As already
stated, what President Aquino approved in 1988 was the establishment and
operation of new DCN plants 
subject to the guidelines to be drawn by the PCA
.
[20]
 In the first place, she could not
have intended to amend the several laws already mentioned, which set up the
regulatory system, by a mere memoranda to the  PCA.  In the second place, even
if that had been her intention, her act would be without effect considering
that, when she issued the memorandum in question on February 11, 1988, she was
no longer vested with legislative authority.
[21]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is GRANTED.  PCA Resolution No. 018-93 and all
certificates of registration issued under it are hereby declared NULL and VOID
for having been issued in excess of the power of the Philippine Coconut
Authority to adopt or issue.

The past decade,
a distinct worldwide trend towards economic deregulation has been evident. Both
developed and developing countries have seriously considered, and extensively
adopted, various measures for this purpose. The Philippines has been no
exception.


To this end, the
Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) issued Board Resolution No. 018-93 (PCA-BR
No. 018-93) dated March 24, 1993, deregulating the coconut processing plant
industry.
[1]
 The Association of Philippine
Desiccators (APCD) has filed this instant petition for prohibition and mandamus
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeking the annulment of said resolution.


APCD questions
the validity of PCA-BR No. 018-93 for being violative of the principle of
non-delegability of legislative power. It contends that in issuing the
resolution deregulating the coconut industry, the PCA exercised legislative
discretion, which has not been delegated to it by Congress. It add that when
PCA deregulated the coconut industry, it ran counter to the very laws
[2]
 which mandated it to regulate and
rationalize the industry.


We see no merit
in this contention. PCAâs authority to issue PCA-BR No. 018-93 is clearly
provided in Section 3(a) of P.D. No. 232, reading as follows:


âx x x To formulate and adopt a
general program of development for the coconut and other palm oil industry.â


Similar grants
of authority were made in subsequent amendatory laws.
[3]


In this regard,
we have ruled that legislative discretion, as to the substantive contents of a
law cannot be delegated. What may be delegated is the discretion to determine
how the law is to be enforced, not what the law should be, a prerogative of the
legislature which can be neither abdicate nor surrender to the delegate.
[4]
 The principle is based on the
separation and allocation of powers among the three departments of government.
[5]


Thus, there are two accepted tests to determine whether or
not there is a valid delegation of legislative power, namely, the completeness
test and the sufficient standard test. Under the first test, the law must be
complete in all its terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature such
that when it reaches the delegate, the only thing he will have to do is to
enforce it. Under the sufficient standard test, there must be adequate
guidelines or limitations in the law to map out the boundaries of the
delegateâs authority and prevent the delegation from running amiss.
[6]


We have accepted
as sufficient standards âinterest of law and order,â
[7]
 âadequate and efficient
instruction,â
[8]
 âpublic interest,â
[9]
 âjustice and equity,â
[10]
 âpublic convenience and welfare.â
[11]
 âsimplicity, economy and
efficiency,â
[12]
 âstandardization and regulation of
medical education,â
[13]
 and âfair and equitable employment
practices.â
[14]
 Consequently, the standard may be
express or implied. In the former, the non-delegation objection is easily met.
The standard though does not have to be spelled out but need only be implied
from the policy and purpose of the act considered as a  whole.
[15]
 It may also be found in other
statutes on the same subject as that of the challenged legislation.
[16]


In no uncertain
terms must it be stressed that the function of promulgating rules and
regulations may be legitimately exercised only for the purpose of carrying out
the provisions of a law. The power of administrative agencies is confined to
implementing the law or putting it into effect. Corollary to this guideline is
that administrative regulation cannot extend the law and amend a legislative
enactment.
[17]


In the instant
case, we believe that the PCA did not overstep the limits of its power in
issuing the assailed resolution. We need not belabor the point that one of the
economic goals of our country is the increased productivity of goods and
services provided by the nation for the benefit of the people,
[18]
 since from a purely economic
standpoint, the increase in agricultural productivity is of fundamental
importance.
[19]


Considering the
responsibilities and powers assigned to the PCA, as well as its underlying
policy, namely, that âthe economic well-being of a major part of the population
depends to a large extent on the viability of the industry and its improvement
in the areas of production, processing and marketing,â the irresistible
conclusion is that PCA-BR No. 018-93 is a valid exercise of delegated
legislation by the PCA. Such resolution is in harmony with the objectives
sought to be achieved by the laws regarding the coconut industry, particularly
âto promote accelerated growth and development of the coconut and other palm
oil industry,â
[20]
 and âthe rapid integrated
development and growth of the coconut and other palm oil industry.â
[21]
 These are sufficient standards to
guide the PCA. Thus, measures to achieve these policies are better left to the
administrative agencies tasked with implementing them.


It must be
stressed that with increasing global trade and business and major upheavals in
technology and communications, the time has come for administrative policies
and regulations to adapt to ever-changing business needs rather than to
accommodate traditional acts of the legislature.
[22]
 Even the 1987 Constitution was
designed to meet, not only contemporary events, but also future and unknown
circumstances.
[23]


It is worth
mentioning that the PCA, after conducting its studies, adopted the policy of
deregulation to further enhance the coconut industry competition, since any
continuation of the restrictive regulation in the industry would have
detrimental effects.
[24]
 This is in consonance with the
constitutional mandate that the State must âadopt measures that help make them
(locally produced goods) competitive.â
[25]
 Undoubtedly, an âagency, in light
of changing circumstances, is free to alter interpretative and policy views
reflected in regulations construing an underlying statute, so long as any
changed construction of the statute is consistent with express congressional
intent or embodies a permissible reading of the statute.â
[26]


Furthermore, the
Constitution is cognizant of the realities of global interdependency, as it
requires the pursuit of âa trade policy that serves the general welfare and
utilizes all forms and arrangements of exchanges on the basis of equality and
reciprocity.â
[27]


In sum, the
policy of deregulation must be determined by the circumstances prevailing in a
certain situation.
[28]
 As we have stressed in the past,
this Court is only concerned with the question of authority, not the wisdom of
the measure involved which falls within the province of the Legislature. 


The 
ponencia

presents the issue: whether it is within the power of the PCA to renounce the
power to regulate implicit in the law creating it (P.D. No. 232). (It is to be
pointed out that this issue was not included in the Assignment of Errors of
Petitioner).


Underlying this
formulation is the assumption/admission that PCA has the power to regulate the
coconut industry, as in fact the power is bestowed upon it by its organic act,
P.D. No. 232, 
viz
. âto promote the rapid integrated development and
growth of the coconut and other palm oil industry in all its aspects and to
ensure that the coconut farmers become direct participants in, and beneficiaries
of, such development and growth.â Its broad mandate is âto formulate and adopt
a general program of development for the coconut and other palm oil industry.â


It avers that
this âlegislative schemeâ was disregarded when the PCA adopted on March 24,
1993 the assailed Resolution which in effect liberalized the registration and
licensing requirements for the granting of permits to operate new coconut
plants. But this was effected pursuant to the October 23, 1987 PCA Board
Resolution laying down the policy of deregulating the industry and authorizing
the creation of additional dessicated coconut plants.


As with any
administrative agency established to promote the growth and development of any
industry, the PCA has considerable latitude to adopt policies designed to
accelerate the attainment of this objective and corollarily, to lay down rules
and regulations to implement the same. We can take judicial notice of the fact
that during its 25 years of existence, the PCA has achieved enough experience and
expertise to introduce measures which shall ensure the dominant role of the
crop as a major dollar-producing industry, including the manipulation of market
forces to our comparative advantage, certainly an area beyond the Courtâs ken.


Hence, guided by
guidelines already laid down, it responded to regional developments by:


(1)
  
taking
cognizance of the overproduction in the industry and curtailing the expansion
of coconut processing plants in 1982, within reasonable limits and with
safeguards (hence the issuance of Executive Order Nos. 826 on August 28, 1982
and No. 854 on December 6, 1982);


(2)
  
five years
later, responding to the demand for dessicated coconut products in the world
market, liberalized its former policy by deregulating the industry and authorizing
the creation of additional dessicated coconut plants in 1987;


(3)
  
complementing
and supplementing (2), by easing registration and licensing requirements in
1993.


It bears
repeating that the above measures were not taken arbitrarily but in careful
compliance with guidelines incorporated in the Executive Orders and subject to
the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and the approval
of the President.


The crux of the 
ponencia

is that, in the process of opening doors to foreign markets, the PCA â
limited
itself to merely monitoring their volumes of production and administration of
quality standards,
 in effect abdicating its role and leaving it almost
totally to market forces to define how the industry will develop.â


Actually, the
relevant provisions in the disputed resolution reads:


âResolved further, that the PCA 
shall
limit itself only to simply registering the aforementioned coconut product
processors for the purpose of monitoring their volumes of production,
administration of quality standards with the corresponding service
fees/charges.
â


For the sake of
clarity and accuracy, it is to be stressed that the PCA did not limit itself
âmerely to monitoringâ¦â as the 
ponencia
 states, but to âregistering the
â¦ processors for the purpose of monitoring their volumes of production and
administration of quality standardsâ¦â


In the actual
words of the Resolution, the PCA recognizes its principal function of
registration so as to be able to monitor the production and administer quality
standards, both objectives of which are not merely nominal or minimal, but
substantial, even vital, aspects of the power to regulate. Put differently,
there is no renunciation of the power to regulate, for the regulation is
essentially recognized and accomplished through the registration function which
enables the PCA to keep track of the volume of production and the observance of
quality standards by nee entrants into the industry. In sum, trimming down its
functions to registration is not an abdication of the power to regulate but is
regulation itself.


If the PCA, in
light of the crucial developments in the regional and domestic coconut industry
decides to open wide its doors, allow the free entry of other players and the
interplay of competitive forces to shape the configuration of the industry, who
are we to declare such policy as one characterized by âwastefulness and
inefficiencyâ¦ based on its naive faith in survival of the fittest.â Is not this
a blatant incursion by the Court into the economic arena which is better left
to the administrative agency precisely tasked to promote the growth of the
industry, through the exercise of its studied discretion? To be sure, those
operators already in the field, such as the petitioner members of the
Association of the Philippine Coconut Desiccators, are expected to vigorously
protest and work for the nullity of what they perceive as an obnoxious,
life-threatening policy. But instead of opposing what the PCA views as a
timely, well-considered move, the healthy competition should spur them to
improving their product and elevating the standards they have imposed on
themselves.


If, in the
course of its monitoring which is a piece of the regulatory function, the PCA
should detect a violation of its guidelines that would result in a lowering of
the quality of the product, or unfairness to other players, surely, it is not
powerless to impose sanctions, as categorically provided in P.D. 1469, P.D.
1644, Adm. Order No. 003, Series of 1981 and Adm. Order No. 002, Series of
1991. Any administrative agency is empowered to establish its implementing
rules, together with sanctions guaranteed to ensure the observance of such
rules, else it would be a mere âtoothlessâ entity.


The 
ponencia

prognosticates, âThe result can very well be a repeat of 1982 when free
enterprise degenerated into a âfree-for-all,â resulting in cutthroat
competition, underselling, the production of inferior products and the like,
which badly affected the foreign trade performance of our coconut industry.â
Are we not encroaching on legislative domain in questioning the wisdom of the
action taken by the PCA which was accorded a broad mandate by the Congress?
Moreover, let us bear in mind that during those âabnormal times,â forces other
than merely economic, e.g. political, dominated the economy effectively
supporting, even favoring, destructive capitalistic monopolies and, in the
process suppressing healthy competition.


Not to forget,
too, that we cannot close our eyes and ignore the worldwide trend towards
globalization in the economy, as in other fields, as in fact the Court
recognized this economic reality in its decision in the Oil Deregulation Case.


With the
enrelenting march of globalization in our economy, the Philippines must find
its market niches and be able to adapt to these inevitable changes, for the
Asia-Pacific rim is bound to become a truly dynamic region in the economic,
political and cultural arenas in the coming milennium.
