[3]
The court held a joint hearing of the cases following the plea by the accused of "not guilty" to all the charges.
The Office of the Solicitor General, in its Appellee's Brief, made an extensive narration of the evidence submitted by the prosecution. Thus -
"On the last week of October 1991, private complainant Reynaldo R. Jugo, a farmer, was visited by his `kumpadre,' Alberto Maclang, a member of the Western Police District (WPD), at his house in Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija. Maclang was accompanied by appellant whom the former introduced to Reynaldo as a recruiter for jobs abroad. Appellant talked with Reynaldo, convincing him that she could do something about Reynaldo's previous application for a job abroad. She represented that she could work on his travel papers within a period of two (2) months and he would be able to work in Japan as a factory worker. Further, appellant told Reynaldo that he only had to produce the initial sum of P5,000.00 for the immediate processing of his papers. Reynaldo thus signed the application form appellant presented to him (TSN, September 8, 1992, pp. 2-4; TSN, August 18, 1992, pp. 3-5; TSN, February 8, 1994, p. 12).
"A week later, appellant and Maclang again went to see Reynaldo at his house in Nueva Ecija. They told him that they would be the ones to first advance the amount of P5,000.00 to cover the expenses for the initial processing of his papers, to which private complainant agreed (TSN, September 8, 1992, p. 4; TSN, August 18, 1992, p. 5).
"Two (2) weeks after, Reynaldo who was still in Nueva Ecija, learned that appellant was trying to get in touch with him relative to his application for a job abroad. So, he left Nueva Ecija and proceeded to the house of Maclang at Naval Street, Malabon, Metro Manila. Maclang confirmed that appellant was indeed looking for Reynaldo. He thus called up appellant and it was arranged that the three (3) of them would meet at the headquarters of the Western Police District (WPD) at U.N. Avenue, Manila, sometime on November 1991 (TSN, August 18, 1992, pp. 5-7).
"During the meeting at the WPD headquarters at U.N. Avenue, appellant asked Reynaldo to give her the amount of P5,000.00 for the processing of his papers. Since Reynaldo had with him only P2,500.00, he was able to give that amount only, for which appellant did not issue any receipt. Thereafter, the three (3) of them proceeded to Ermita to take some snacks. In the course of taking their snacks, appellant was trying to convince Reynaldo to look for persons interested to go abroad for employment and to refer them to her. After they parted ways, Reynaldo returned to Nueva Ecija (TSN, September 8, 1992, p. 4; August 18, 1992, pp. 6-7).
"Subsequently, sometime on January 1992, Reynaldo was informed by appellant that his passport will soon be released. She told Reynaldo to prepare the amount of P18,000.00 for his plane fare to Japan. Reynaldo thus prepared that amount which he borrowed from his sister, Rosita Jugo. When Reynaldo and appellant met at the house of Reynaldo's mother at Malabon, Metro Manila, he asked appellant to issue him a receipt for the amount he was about to pay her. Appellant however refused and replied that `it seems you do not trust me.' Feeling assured and trusting appellant, Reynaldo was persuaded to hand to appellant the amount of P18,000.00 (TSN, August 18, 1992, pp. 7-8; February 22, 1994, pp. 11-12).
"Two (2) weeks after, appellant went to see Reynaldo at his house in Nueva Ecija. She presented him with a passport issued in his name. However, verification with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Japanese Embassy revealed that the passport given to him by appellant was a fake. When the passport was likewise referred to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), it was also determined to be a fake. Reynaldo was thus advised to file a complaint against appellant (TSN, September 8, 1992; p. 5; TSN, August 18, 1992, pp. 8-10).
"Earlier, Reynaldo had introduced his brother, Jose Jugo, and their sister, Rosita Jugo, to appellant. Almost simultaneously with appellant's transactions with Reynaldo, appellant also transacted with Reynaldo's brother and sister. Jose and Rosita met appellant for the first time on December 2, 1991, along with Alberto Maclang, the `kumpadre' of their brother, Reynaldo, and the alleged `second' husband of appellant. They met at appellant's office at Tayabas, Tondo, Manila. Jose and Rosita were made to fill up application forms after they were informed that they would be deployed as factory workers to Japan for the consideration of P70,000.00 (TSN, September 8, 1992, pp. 6-8; TSN, August 18, 1992, p. 11; TSN, September 22, 1992, pp. 2, 5).
"The following day or on December 3, 1991, Jose Jugo personally paid to appellant the first installment in the amount of P2,000.00 at Dampalit, Malabon, Metro Manila. It was followed by subsequent installments paid to appellant at her office at Tayabas, Tondo, Manila, in the following amounts:
 
 
2nd Installment
 
-
 
P 20,000.00
 
 
 
3rd Installment
 
-
 
P 10,000.00
 
 
 
4th Installment
 
-
 
P 18,000.00
 
 
 
5th Installment
 
-
 
P 2,000.00
 
 
 
6th Installment
 
-
 
P 18,000.00
 
 
Jose Jugo gave the last installment to complete the total amount of P70,000.00 on January 9, 1992. Appellant, however, did not issue any receipt for any of the above-stated amounts she received from Jose Jugo. When the latter asked for receipts of payment, appellant countered that he seems to have no trust in her (TSN, September 8, 1992, pp. 8-10; TSN, September 22, 1992, pp. 4, 6).
"After receipt of Jose Jugo's last installment on January 9, 1992, appellant handed to him a passport with numbers 203409 issued in his name, bearing what appellant represented to be a visa to enable him to work in Japan. Then, for several times, he was allegedly scheduled to depart for Japan but none of those scheduled departures ever pushed through. When Jose caused the alleged visa to be verified by the Japanese Embassy, and later by the Bureau of Immigration, it was determined to be a fake and the alleged visa number a tampered one. The alleged passport was likewise determined to be fake (TSN, September 8, 1992, pp. 10-12; TSN, September 22, 1992, p. 8).
"For her part, Rosita Jugo attested that she likewise gave the amount of P2,500.00 to appellant upon the latter's assurance of a job placement in Japan as a factory worker. She gave the amount to appellant at the latter's office at Tondo, Manila for which no receipt was issued to her. Rosita was also not able to leave for Japan. Worse, appellant did not heed Rosita's request that her money be returned although appellant had earlier executed an undertaking to return all the money she received from Rosita and private complainants Reynaldo and Jose (TSN, October 13, 1992, pp. 2-4).
âVerification from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) revealed that appellant was not a licensed recruiter and a certification to that effect was issued. The Jugos referred the matter to the NBI which conducted an investigation. Thereafter, the case was referred to the Office of the City State Prosecutor, Manila, which filed the cases at bar (TSN, October 13, 1992, p. 3).
"While trial was ongoing and before the prosecution could rest its case on September 25, 1992, appellant escaped from her jail guard while under confinement at the UST Hospital. Consequently, the prosecution adduced evidence in appellant's absence and the case was submitted for resolution. Appellant managed to stay out of jail for one (1) year during which period, she made arrangements with private complainants to pay them the amount of P120,000.00 through Alberto Maclang. It was only sometime on September 1993 when appellant was again apprehended by agents of the NBI. At her instance, the trial court reopened the case to accord appellant the opportunity to present her defense. Appellant presented as evidence an alleged affidavit of desistance which contents and due execution were, however, repudiated and disclaimed by private complainant Reynaldo Jugo, the alleged affiant thereof (TSN, February 8, 1994, pp. 19-21)."
[4]
The defense had its own version. Counsel Felixberto C. de la Cruz, joined by Atty. Ma. Soledad Derquito-Mawis, recited what the defense considered to be the brief factual settings of the three cases.
"At the time of the commission of the acts complained of, appellant Ma. Lourdes Bautista de Guiang was a licensed contractor of a low-cost housing project earning a monthly net income of P50,000.00 to P70,000.00 (Exh. 3; pp. 17-19, tsn. Feb. 8, 1994). Prior thereto, she operated business under the name LGB Enterprises and General Services, earning P10,000.00 to P15,000.00 a month (Exh. 2; p. 2, tsn. Feb. 22, 1994). She had never been engaged in the processing of travel documents in recruitment basis (p. 5, tsn., Feb. 8, 1996). 
"On the other hand, private complainants, namely: Reynaldo Jugo, Jose Jugo and Rosita are brothers and sister (p. 6, tsn., Aug. 18, 1996).
"Sometime in 1991, appellant and one Alberto Maclang went to Nueva Ecija to get the harvested rice of the latter. When they were about to return to Manila, Maclang decided to visit his friend and compadre Reynaldo Jugo. During this visit, Maclang and Reynaldo Jugo talked about the latter's lost passport and visa. Reynaldo Jugo asked Maclang how he could retrieve said travel documents which were never returned to him when he applied in the Japanese Embassy. Maclang, in turn, asked appellant if she could help. Appellant replied that she will try her best through the help of a certain Mr. Salazar, her friend in the Japanese embassy. Since Reynaldo Hugo had no money at that time, he promised to leave his stainless jeep if she could cause the re-issuance of his lost [passport] and visa, subject to redemption upon his return from Japan (pp. 3-6, Feb. 8, 1994).
"Subsequently, Maclang, introduced appellant to Jose Jugo who was also interested in applying for a tourist visa for Japan. Thereafter, Reynaldo Jugo, Jose Hugo and Rosita Jugo directly transacted business with Mr. Salazar for the issuance of their tourist visas (p. 8, tsn., Feb. 8, 1994). In the course of the Jugos' transaction with Mr. Salazar, appellant received a call from Mr. Salazar informing her that the Jugos were going to pay P40,000.00 for the processing of their passports and visas. Appellant received the said amount from the Jugos but turned over the same to Mr. Salazar without a receipt (pp. 8-16, tsn., Feb. 8, 1994).
"Reynaldo Jugo and Jose Jugo received their respective passports and tourist visa but were found to be fake. Appellant was thus arrested and subsequently charged of illegal recruitment and estafa on two counts.
"On March 16, 1992, appellant she signed a promissory note (Exh. B-Reynaldo Jugo, Folder of Exhibits) which reads: `Promise to pay Rosita Jugo the amount of P93,000.00 as payment for money received by me for having failed to [send] them abroad;' else, the NBI would publish the incident in the newspaper and report the same in the television (pp. 22-23, tsn., Feb. 8, 1994).
"After the filing the cases in court, Reynaldo Jugo executed an affidavit of desistance (Exh. 1, p. 77, Rec.) stating that he filed the illegal recruitment case against appellant was really due to misunderstanding with a request the case be dismissed."
[5]
The RTC, Hon. William Bayhon presiding, convicted the accused on all counts. The respective dispositive portions of its decision on the three jointly tried cases read:
"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Lourdes Bautista de Guiang guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Art. 38 (a), Presidential Decree No. 1412, amending certain provisions of Book L, Pres. Decree No. 442, otherwise known as the New Labor Code of the Philippines in relation to Art. 13 (b) and (c) of said code as further amended by Pres. Decree Nos. 1693, 1920 and 2018 and is sentenced to suffer the maximum penalty of Life Imprisonment and pay a fine of P100,000.00 as provided for by law with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency with respect to the fine but in no case shall it exceed 1/3 of the principal penalty.
"Likewise the Court finds accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa in the other two cases.
"In Criminal Case No. 92-104616 for Estafa involving P20,500.00, she is sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of One (1) year, Eight (8) Months and Twenty-One (21) Day[s] of Prision Correccional as the minimum to Five (5) Years, Five (5) Months and Eleven (11) days as maximum of Prision Correccional in its maximum period and to pay Reynaldo Jugo the sum of P20,500.00.
"In Criminal Case No. 92-104615 for Estafa in the amount of P70,000.00, she is sentenced to suffer imprisonment of Four (4) years and Two (2) Months of Prision Correccional as the minimum to Six (6) years, Eight (8) Months and Twenty-One (21) days of prision correccional as the maximum plus One (1) year imprisonment for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00 and to indemnify the offended party Jose Jugo the sum of P70,000.00
"SO ORDERED."
[6]
In her appeal to this Court, accused-appellant Lourdes Bautista de Guiang faults the trial court for having relied heavily on the testimony of prosecution witnesses, complainants Reynaldo Jugo, Jose Jugo and Rosita Jugo, anchoring her argument on,
 firstly,
 the supposed nefarious motives of the complainants and, 
secondly,
 on the affidavit of desistance executed by Reynaldo Jugo attributing the complaint against appellant merely to a "misunderstanding."
The appeal lacks merit.
The allegation of improper motives on the part of the prosecution witnesses has not been satisfactorily shown in evidence. Appellant merely hypothesizes, in effect, that the non-inclusion of a certain Alberto Maclang, whom the trial court described as having had a significant role in the deception played on the complainants, has only been to "force appellant to convince Maclang to refund the money"
[7]
 to the Jugos. Aside from being a conjecture, the proposition advanced is, to say the least, much too strained and hard to follow. It does not seem to make any sense for the complainants to go through an elaborate and circuitous scheme, such as by initiating and prosecuting these cases against appellant, merely to pin ultimate liability on Maclang. The fact alone that Maclang is a "kumpadre" of one of the complainants could scarcely be reason enough for complainants not to directly and promptly implicate Maclang. Equating appellant's culpability to that of Maclang, in any event, will not necessarily either tie up the guilt or dictate the innocence of appellant.
Neither does the affidavit of desistance by Reynaldo Jugo subvert the testimony given by the witnesses. Not only did Reynaldo Jugo repudiate the affidavit
[8]
 but that also affidavits of desistance are best ignored when pitted against positive evidence given at the witness stand.
The matter of assessing credibility, most of all, is a function that lies with the trial court more than an appellate court. Nor has the trial court been here inattentive to details; thus, it has observed:
"There is no reason to doubt the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution who are simple barrio folks, one a farmer from Nueva Ecija and the other one a fisherman. From their appearances and manner of testifying in Court, pervision of the truth is far and remote. The Court could see that they are not the type of persons who would fabricate and concoct stories only to prosecute the accused. Reynaldo Jugo will not come all the way from Sta. Rosa, Nueva Ecija to follow up his case and attend the trial on several occasions had it not been for the assurance of accused to deploy them to Japan for a consideration. They would not take the trouble of coming to Court on several occasions if they have no other motive, except to seek for justice for themselves.
"On the other hand, accused have resorted to trickeries, even feigning illness for herself with the connivance of some jail personnel if only to escape from the clutches of the law. And finally thru the evil doings of Alberto Maclang, he coerced and threatened complainant Reynaldo Jugo into signing an Affidavit of Desistance hoping that the Court would dismiss these cases against accused Lourdes Bautista Guiang."
[9]
Be that, such as it may, the Court itself has gone over the testimony of each of the complainants, and the credence of their declarations is quite evident. Thus -

"Q
 
 So when the accused gave you this, what did you do?

"Q
 
 So what finally happened with that scheduled of yours?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 What we did, sir, was to verify in the Japanese Embassy about this. We were told there is no such number released.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 Are you referring to this number appearing in Exh. A-1-a?

Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 And when you came to know that there is no such number as this, what did you do?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 In order to be doubly sure, really sure, I made a verification in the Bureau of Immigration.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 What did you verify in the Bureau of Immigration?

 We found out that the number, this number is tampered and I was advised not to proceed otherwise I might land in jail.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 So when you came to know about this, what did you do?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 I still have it examined by the NBI in order to be sure.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 And what did the NBI do?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 Director Salvador Ramin said it was indeed fake.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 Which is fake, the passport or Visa?

 The Visa.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 How about the passport, did you inquire about the Passport, Exh. A?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 I did not verify but according to Dir. Salvador Ramin, it was also fake.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 So when Dir. Ramin of the NBI told you that this Document, passport and Visa are fake, what did you do?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 We complained to the NBI.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 In other words, you were not able to go abroad to Japan?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 No, because I am here.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 How about the money which you gave to the accused?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 It was not returned to us. We are asking to her . . ."

"Q
 
 What was the result?

 So after that what happened?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"A
 
 My NBI friend told me to file a complaint and there should be three of us.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 So did you make a complaint?

The prosecution has adequately established that appellant did offer to the complainants, namely, Reynaldo Jugo, Jose Jugo and Rosita Jugo, overseas employment for a fee without first being duly licensed to so engage in such activity, an act embraced within the term "recruitment and placement" prohibited by Article 38, in relation to Article 13 and Article 39, of the Labor Code. The crime, if perpetrated against at least three persons, whether individually or as a group, is deemed committed "in large scale" that carries, pursuant to Article 38, in relation to Article 39, of the Labor Code, the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos.
Appellant, through misrepresentations and deceit, has likewise succeeded in defrauding complainant Jose Jugo in the sum of P70,000 and complainant Reynaldo Jugo in the amount of P20,500. These acts have independently transgressed Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code. Estafa, pursuant to that law, is committed by a person who defrauds another by abuse of confidence or deceit to the latter's damage. If the amount of the fraud is over P12,000 but does not exceed P22,000, the penalty of 
prision correccional
 in its maximum period to 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period is imposed; if the fraud exceeds P22,000, the above prescribed penalty is imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional P10,000, provided, however, that the total penalty shall not exceed twenty years.
The Court agrees with the observation of the Solicitor General that the trial court erred neither in its findings nor in its judgment appealed from.WHEREFORE, the decision of the court a quo is AFFIRMED. Costs against appellant.
SO ORDERED.
