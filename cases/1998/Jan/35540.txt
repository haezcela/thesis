PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMEO GALLO Y IGLOSO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 
D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


It is disturbing enough to see that there has been a noticeable increase in the incidents of rape but one is left completely appalled that this still growing number includes cases of the bestial act being perpetrated on the young and innocent and, no longer too infrequently it seems, compounded by the close kinship of the offender and the victim.
In People vs. Malagar,
[1]
 the Court has had occasion to state that a -
"x x x (F)ather is looked up to as the protector and as the guardian of his family, remaining ever wary of even the slightest harm that might befall it. It is difficult to thus imagine that any such man could instead stand as the predator of his own flesh and blood. Yet, we occasionally would find ourselves so regrettably contending with it as a fact."
[2]
In the instant case, the accused, Romeo Gallo y Igloso, was charged, docketed Criminal Case No. 2282, before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 68, of Binangonan, Rizal, with the crime of rape in an information that read:
"That on or sometime the period of May, 1994 in the Municipality of Cardona, Province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with a 13-year old girl, Marites Gallo y Segovia.
"CONTRARY TO LAW."
[3]
The accused pleaded not guilty; trial ensued in due time.
In a decision, dated 17 April 1996, Romeo Gallo y Igloso was ultimately convicted of rape committed against his own daughter, Marites Gallo y Segovia, only then thirteen years of age. The death penalty having been imposed by the trial court, the records of the case were transmitted to this Court by way of an automatic review pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 22 of Republic Act No. 7659.
The Solicitor General recommends an affirmance of the decision. He makes the following statement of facts:
"For three years, since age ten, complainant Marites Gallo y Segovia suffered repeated sexual abuses from her father, herein appellant Romeo Gallo y Igloso, the last of which was in their house at Sitio Alacos, Lambac, Cardona, Rizal at around 7:00 in the evening (Exh. 'A') in May 1994 (TSN, Feb. 8, 1995, pp. 4-5; March 13, 1995, p. 2).
"That evening, appellant, taking advantage of the situation that Marites was only with her younger brother who was already asleep, again imposed his bestial desire on his own daughter. Subjecting his daughter to the usual threat that she would be killed if anybody would know his bestiality, appellant (with his pants off) undressed Marites, removed her underpants, kissed her and inserted his penis into her vagina (Annex 'A,' TSN, Feb. 8, 1995, pp. 25-27).
"After appellant's last sexual onslaught, Marites, now thirteen, finally mustered enough courage and narrated her harrowing experience to her aunt Dolores del [Prado]. Accompanied by the latter, Marites reported the incident to the Barangay Captain of Lambac, Cardona, Rizal (TSN, Feb. 8, 1995, pp. 6-7). The incident led to the investigation by the Cardona Police. Marites executed her complaint-affidavit (Exh. 'A,' 'A-1;' Id., pp. 8-10).
"Marites was, thereafter, brought to Camp Crame, Quezon City and was examined by Dr. Cristina B. Freyra who found Marites to be in a non-virgin state. The result of the examination was reduced in writing and covered by Medico-Legal Report No. M-0963-94 (Exh. `B,' `B-1;' Id., p. 12; TSN, Sept. 5, 1995, pp. 6-7)."
[4]
The defense pictured the accused as any other ordinary man in the family who had tried hard to provide and care for his wife and children. At certain times, the accused conceded, he would meet and drink with friends. The appellant's brief summed up the testimony of Gallo given before the court below; viz:
"Accused Romeo Gallo testified that he is a native of Masbate and he got married to his wife Elvie Sigovia in 1975. They were married in the Island of Lambac, Cardona, Rizal. Marites, the complaining witness in this case is his eldest child who was born in 1977. Marites was born in Bicol where Elvie, his wife, formerly resided. His daughter Marites stayed with his mother-in-law in Bicol for three (3) years. After three years, Marites already stayed with his family. In 1989, his family, together with Marites, stayed [in] Mindoro up to 1994. During their stay in Mindoro they engaged themselves [in] farming, planting palay, cassava and `kamoteng bagin.' When asked about the incident that Marites related during her testimony, that she was first molested by the accused, he said that he [did] not know about their accusations. He has no knowledge of any charge against him, for what Marites has said are not true. He treated Marites as a family and he performs his obligation over his family. As far as he remember[s], he spanked his children whenever they commit mistakes as a part of discipline. He and his family alone were in Mindoro, his mother-in-law was not with them.
"In 1994, they moved to Lambac, Cardona, Rizal and there, they engaged in charcoal making somewhere in the mountainous part of Lambac. With him was his whole family of six (6) children and his wife, and they occupy a nipa hut. When asked of the incident that happened in the mountainous part of Lambac where he was accused of molesting [his] child Marites, he answered that he knows nothing about it. The truth is that one time he beat Marites and may be she was hurt and related the matter to her mother-in-law. His mother-in-law was making `sulsol' to his daughter to file this case against him so that he and his wife will be separated. His mother-in-law wanted them to be separated because of his poverty. He tried to convince his child Marites to discontinue filing this case but she did not listen. He [has] never molested her daughter Marites Gallo even once.
"On cross examination, he testified that when he married his wife Elvie Gallo, he was then a charcoal maker and before their marriage he [did] not know her mother-in-law. It was only because of the prodding of his mother-in-law that this case was filed by her daughter. Even in 1975 when he got married to his wife Elvie he was still poor and this may be the reason why his mother-in-law wanted him to be separated from his family. At one time he inflicted punishment [on] Marites and this is probably the reason why Marites agreed to file this case against him. On that occasion, he spanked Marites on the buttocks. He admit[ted] to be drinking liquor for a long time during the intervals of weeks x x x with companions in Lambac, Cardona, Rizal. They have stayed in Mindoro from 1984 to 1993, then they moved to Lambac, Cardona, Rizal. After the testimony of this accused, the defense rested its case. (TSN, pp. 3-17, November 27, 1995)"
[5]
Contending that the prosecution has failed to overcome the Constitutional presumption of innocence by an exacting standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, appellant downgrades the testimony of the complainant as being nothing but incredulous.
The Court has taken meticulous care in reviewing the evidence submitted by both the prosecution and the defense. All possible angles have been considered in the process, for, as it has so recently been said in People vs. Galera,
[6]
 "the Court exercises the greatest circumspection" in its review of death penalty cases since "there can be no stake higher and no penalty more severe x x x than the termination of a human life." Regrettably in this instance, the Court must agree with the trial court in the judgment of conviction.
Cognizant of the fact that the focal, as well as crucial, point in this review is the testimony of the young victim, and because, except for a bare denial, there hardly is any direct rebutting evidence, the Court finds it fitting to hear, here again, Marites, in her own words, on the unfortunate saga. Thus -

Marites spoke of not one but of several sexual transgressions committed, as if so casually, on her by her own father, the first of which occurred when she was only ten years of age and the last when she was thirteen. For some undisclosed reasons, appellant was not charged with the prior offenses.
Almost invariably, the Court uses three guiding principles in the review of rape cases, to wit: (1) An accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense.
[9]
 It is within these parameters that this Court, not much unlike that of the trial court, has made its evaluation of the case.
Since the participants are usually the only witnesses in crimes of this nature, the conviction or acquittal of the accused would virtually depend on the credibility of the complainant's testimony.
[10]
 If found credible, the lone declaration of facts given by the offended party would be sufficient to sustain a conviction.
[11]
 A victim of sexual assault would not ordinarily be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial, let alone testify on the details of her ordeal, if her reasons were other than her natural passion to avenge her honor
[12]
 and to condemn a grave injustice done to her.
[13]
 Even more improbable than any other case perhaps, is for a young girl to accuse her own father for her defilement,
[14]
 and so expose not only herself but the family as well to shame and scandal, if the charges were untrue and merely made up.
[15]
Understandably in the case at bar, appellant could only resort to, and content himself by, having a recourse to mere generalities, such as those hereinafter discussed, so normally employed as defense strategy when the evidence for the prosecution appears to be formidable.
In giving full credence to the testimony of the victim, the trial court has found no cogent reason to deny her credibility and to discard what it described to be her "coherent and straightforward" narration of the incident. That court has had all the opportunity to observe closely the demeanor of the young victim at the witness stand. Well settled is the rule that an assessment made by a trial court on the testimony of witnesses deserves great respect absent any valid justification that can warrant its outright rejection by an appellate court.
[16]
 Nothing significant has been shown to convince the Court that the trial court has at any time acted with undue bias or that it has overlooked or ignored something of substance that could have, in any degree, warranted a turnabout by it of its findings and judgment. Occasional flaws or unguarded exaggerations in the testimony of witnesses, verily, could lend and add up to the credence of testimony.
[17]
 A completely accurate description of the incident certainly cannot be expected from a witness in recounting the details of a harrowing experience.
[18]
 An errorless declaration could, in fact, be suspect for a rehearsed testimony.
Appellant bewails the supposed failure of the offended party to promptly report the crime to the authorities. The delay and initial reluctance of a rape victim to make public the assault on her virtue is neither unknown nor uncommon.
[19]
 It is not an unexpected reaction of a woman to keep secret, at least momentarily, the dishonor brought to bear on her and to suffer alone in her misfortune rather than to be the subject of embarrassment, public scrutiny, pity or ridicule. Fear, brought about by threat or when, such as in the case at bar, the rapist is living under the same roof with his victim,
[20]
 is a circumstance that can easily muffle the latter into silence while that fear lasts. Age is another.
[21]
 Thus we have stated:
"Vacillation in the filing of complaints by rape victims is not an uncommon phenomenon. This crime is normally accompanied by the rapist's threat on the victim's life, and the fear can last for quite a while. There is also the natural reluctance of a woman to admit her sullied chastity, accepting thereby all the stigma it leaves, and to then expose herself to the morbid curiosity of the public whom she may likely perceive, rightly or wrongly, to be more interested in the prurient details of the ravishment than in her vindication and the punishment of the rapist. In People vs. Coloma [222 SCRA 255] we have even considered an 8-year delay in reporting the long history of rape by the victim's father as understandable and so not enough to render incredible the complaint of a 13-year old daughter."
[22]
Marites, to stress once again, was only between ten and thirteen years old when she was subjected to repeated bestial abuse. The unbelievable depravity was committed by her own father, described by the victim's younger brother Christopher Gallo to be a cruel and violent man particularly when drunk. It was to her credit that she ultimately found the right composure and determination, belated such as it might have been, to finally have her father brought to justice.
Everything considered, the Court is convinced that accused-appellant did commit the crime of rape on his own 13-year old daughter. This offense is defined and made punishable by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The law, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659
[23]
 reads:
"ART. 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.
"1.      By using force or intimidation;
"2.      When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
"3.      When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
"The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.
"Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
"When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.
"When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
"When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death. 
"The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
"1.      When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
"2.      When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.
"3.      When the rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.
"4.      When the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.
"5.      When the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.
"6.      When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.
"7.      When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation." 
The crime of rape, having been committed by appellant on his own daughter of thirteen years of age, is consequently covered by the above mandatory death penalty provision. Thus, following its deliberations, the Court by a majority vote, with two members voting to only impose the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 on constitutional grounds, sustains the trial court in the imposition of the death penalty on appellant Romeo Gallo y Igloso.
WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED except for the award of civil indemnity which is INCREASED to P50,000.00. Costs against accused-appellant.
In accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, let the records of the case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of the pardoning power.
