Motion to issue an order authorizing Atty. Calonge to withdraw from BCF Credit Coop. Filed on 03-02-14
04/16/14
In a Resolution dated August 4, 2015, the Court referred the Letter dated June 4, 2015 of Presiding Judge Demot-MariÃ±as to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.
A.M. RTJ-16-2446
On February 27, 2013, the Office of the Deputy Court Administrator Raul Villanueva (
DCA Villanueva
) received an indorsement from the Office of the Chief Justice regarding the letter of Ms. Nugal-Koh wherein the latter sought the intercession of the Court for the speedy disposition of her case docketed as Special Proceedings Case No. 95-SP-0086 entitled "
Pedro Nugal, et al. v. Lilia Nugal-Koh, et al.
," which allegedly had been submitted for resolution for more than ten (10) years already at the time of the complaint.
Acting on the said Letter, a 1
st
 Indorsement dated March 4, 2013 was sent directing Judge Demot-MariÃ±as to comment thereon. On June 5, 2013, another Letter from Ms. Nugal-Koh, addressed to the Office of the Chief Justice, was received by DCA Villanueva's office again seeking assistance for the immediate resolution of her case. Attached to the said Letter were the (1) Certification dated April 23, 2013 from Atty. Maribel B. Macario, Clerk of Court V, Branch 8, RTC, La Trinidad, Benguet, attesting that no decision was rendered yet in the subject case; and (2) another Letter from the Office of the Chief Justice dated April 12, 2013, referring the letter dated February 13, 2013 of Ms. Nugal-Koh to Judge Demot-MariÃ±as wherein the latter was requested to submit a feedback on the matter within fifteen (15) days from the receipt thereof.
Consequently, a 2
nd
 Indorsement dated June 5, 2013 was sent to Judge Demot-MariÃ±as, reiterating the earlier directive for her to comment on the status of Ms. Nugal-Koh's case, with a stem warning that appropriate proceedings may be initiated against her for her inaction.
On September 17, 2013, the Office of DCA Villanueva again received a Letter dated September 11, 2013 from Ms. Nugal-Koh repeating her request regarding her case and appending a new certification dated September 2, 2013 attesting that her case remained undecided. Thus, a 3
rd
 Indorsement was sent to respondent judge regarding the matter with the information that initiation of administrative proceedings against her was already being considered for her apparent delay in deciding the subject case and her blatant disregard of directives relative thereto despite repeated orders.
In an Agenda Report dated February 18, 2014, the OCA found that Judge Demot-MariÃ±as indeed failed to comply with the repeated directives from the Office of DCA Villanueva, and with the letter from the Office of the Chief Justice requiring her to comment on the status of the subject case. Thus, the OCA recommended that the report be treated as a formal administrative complaint against Judge Demot-MariÃ±as for insubordination, inefficiency and neglect of duty.
In a Resolution dated June 2, 2014, the Court resolved to treat the OCA's Agenda Report dated February 18, 2014 as a formal administrtive complaint against Judge Demot-MariÃ±as for Inefficiency and Neglect of Duty. In addition, the Court also required respondent to explain why she should not be held administratively liable for her failure to comply with the repeated directives to comment on the status of Special Proceedings Case No. 95-SP-0086. The Court, likewise, directed respondent to comment and submit a report on the status of the above-mentioned case.
In a Resolution dated November 26, 2014, the Court referred the Letter dated September 11, 2014 of Ms. Nugal-Koh to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation. As contained therein, Ms. NugalÂ­ Koh said that as of July 9, 2014, no decision has been rendered by respondent Judge Demot-MariÃ±as in her case as certified by Atty. Macario Pedro, Branch Clerk of Court.
In a Memorandum dated December 1, 2015, the OCA recommended that: (1) the two (2) instant administrative matters be consolidated; and (2) respondent Judge Marybelle L. Demot-MariÃ±as be found guilty of grave misconduct, insubordination and gross inefficiency and be dismissed from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits.
On February 17, 2016, as per recommendation of the OCA, considering the similarity of the issues of both cases, the Court resolved to consolidate the instant administrative complaints against respondent Judge Demot-MariÃ±as.
RULING
We adopt the findings and recommendation of the OCA.
The Court has consistently impressed upon judges the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously under the time-honored precept that justice delayed is justice denied. Every judge should decide cases with dispatch and should be careful, punctual, and observant in the performance of his functions for delay in the disposition of cases erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary, lowers its standards and brings it into disrepute. Failure to decide a case within the reglementary period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency warranting the imposition of administrative sanctions on the defaultingjudge.
[1]
Here, there is no question as to the guilt of Judge Demot-MariÃ±as. As shown by the records, she has been remiss in the performance of her responsibilities. She failed to decide cases and resolve pending incidents within the reglementary period, without any authorized extension from this Court. Respondent judge failed to: (1) decide 150 cases submitted for decision [45 criminal cases and 105 civil case] which are beyond the period to decide, and to (2) resolve the pending motions/incidents in 17 cases [2 criminal cases and 15 civil cases].
[2]
 Some of the cases were already submitted for decision since 2002, particularly Civil Case No. 2831 and Civil Case No. 2217.
[3]
 More appalling is that she did not give any reason/explanation for her failure to comply with the reglementary period for deciding cases. There were, likewise, no previous requests by her for extension of time to decide said cases. Thus, in the instant case, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as' gross inefficiency is, therefore, evident in her undue delay deciding 150 cases within the reglementary period and her failure to resolve pending motions/incidents in 17 cases.
Article VIII, Section 15(l) of the 1987 Constitution provides that lower courts have three months within which to decide cases or resolve matters submitted to them for resolution. Moreover, Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct enjoins judges to dispose of their business promptly and decide cases within the required period. In addition, this Court laid down the guidelines in SC Administrative Circular No. 13
[4]
 which provides, 
inter alia
, that "[j]udges shall observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15, of the Constitution for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts. Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts, while all other lower courts are given a period of three months to do so." The Court has reiterated this admonition in SC Administrative Circular No. 3-99
[5]
 which requires all judges to scrupulously observe the periods prescribed in the Constitution for deciding cases and the failure to comply therewith is considered a serious violation of the constitutional right of the parties to speedy disposition of their cases.
[6]
This Court has consistently held that failure to decide cases and other matters within the reglementary period constitutes 
gross inefficiency
 and warrants the imposition of administrative sanction against the erring magistrate. Respondent judge failed to live up to the exacting standards of duty and responsibility that her position required. As a trial judge, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as is a frontline official of the judiciary and should have at all times acted with efficiency and with probity.
[7]
A.M. RTJ-16-2446
We likewise find similarly concerning is Judge Demot-MariÃ±as' indifference to the indorsements requiring her to comment on the accusations against her. In all three (3) indorsements issued by the OCA, as well as one (1) Letter from the Office of the Chief Justice, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as ignored the directives for her to file the required comment since no comment or compliance has been submitted despite several opportunities given to her which ran in a span of more than three (3) years. Also, as per verification by the OCA of the status of Special Proceedings No. 95-SP-0086, as of December 2015, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as has yet to decide the case which was already submitted for decision since May 12, 2003. It is then apparent that failure to comment despite several directives, as well as the failure to comply with the immediate resolution of Ms. Nugal-Koh's letter, show her propensity to disregard and disobey lawful orders of her superior.
We would like to further stress that all directives coming from the Court Administrator and his deputies are issued in the exercise of this Court's administrative supervision of trial courts and their personnel, hence, should be respected. These directives are not mere requests, but should be complied with promptly and completely. Clearly, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as' unexplained disregard of the orders of the OCA for her to comment on the complaint shows her disrespect for and contempt, not just for the OCA, but also for the Court, which exercises direct administrative supervision over trial court officers and employees through the OCA. Her indifference to, and disregard of, the directives issued to her clearly constituted insubordination which this Court will not tolerate.
[8]
We cannot overemphasize that compliance with the rules, directives and circulars issued by the Court is one of the foremost duties that a judge accepts upon assumption to office. This duty is verbalized in Canon 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:
[9]
SECTION 7. Judges shall encourage and uphold safeguards for the discharge of judicial duties in order to maintain and enhance the institutional and operational independence of the Judiciary.
SECTION 8. Judges shall exhibit and promote high standards of judicial conduct in order to reinforce public confidence in the Judiciary, which is fundamental to the maintenance of judicial independence.
The obligation to uphold the dignity of her office and the institution which she belongs to is also found in Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct under Rule 2.01, which mandates a judge to behave at all times as to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Under the circumstances, We can thus conclude that the conduct exhibited by Judge Demot-MariÃ±as constitutes no less than clear acts of defiance against the Court's authority. Her conduct also reveals her deliberate disrespect and indifference to the authority of the Court, shown by her failure to heed our warnings and directives.
We cannot tolerate this type of behavior especially on a judge. Public confidence in the judiciary can only be achieved when the court personnel conduct themselves in a dignified manner befitting the public office they are holding. Judges should avoid conduct or any demeanor that may tarnish or diminish the authority of the Supreme Court.
[10]
 Clearly, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as' attitude, as shown by her unexplained failure to decide 150 cases as well as motions and incidents, and her failure to respond to any of the court's directives despite several reminders, betray her lack of concern for her office. In sum, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as has been remiss in the performance of her official duties exacerbated by her audacious stance in defying this Court's orders. We cannot tolerate the attitude of respondent judge m defying this Court's authority and undermining its integrity.
Penalty
The rules and jurisprudence are clear on the matter of delay. Failure to decide cases and other matters within the reglementary period constitutes 
gross inefficiency
 and warrants the imposition of administrative sanction against the erring magistrate.
[11]
 Further, Judge Demot-MariÃ±as' deliberate and repeated failure to comply with the directives of the OCA constitutes Gross Misconduct which is a serious offense under Section 8,
[12]
 Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.
In 
Re: Audit Report in Attendance of Court Personnel of RTC, Branch 32, Manila
,
[13]
 We held that it is 
gross misconduct
, even outright disrespect for the Court, for respondent judge to exhibit indifference to the resolution requiring him to comment on the accusations in the complaint thoroughly and substantially. Such failure to comply accordingly betrays not only a recalcitrant streak in character, but also disrespect for the Court's lawful order and directive.
Likewise, in 
Alonto-Frayna v. Astih
,
[14]
 a judge who deliberately and continuously fails and refuses to comply with the resolution of this Court is guilty of gross misconduct and insubordination, and was dismissed from service.
Judging by the foregoing circumstances, the Court can only conclude that Judge Demot-MariÃ±as is guilty of 
gross inefficiency
 resulting in her unexplained failure to resolve pending cases and motions within the reglementary period despite several reminders and follow-ups, and 
gross misconduct
 for her non-compliance with the directives/orders of the OCA and this Court.
In this scenario, Section 17 of the Omnibus Rules implementing the Civil Service Law states that if the respondent judge is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge or counts and the rest may be considered aggravating circumstances.
[15]
 The most serious of the charges against respondent judge is her gross misconduct, and her gross inefficiency is considered an aggravating circumstance.
We would have imposed the penalty of dismissal from service on Judge Demot-MariÃ±as, however, considering that on December 10, 2015, she has filed her certificate of candidacy to run for public office, she is now deemed resigned from judicial office. Nevertheless, cessation from office by reason of resignation, death or retirement is not a ground to dismiss the case filed against her at the time that she was still in the public service.

except
 accrued leave credits. Furthermore, she is barred from re-employment in any branch or service of the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations.
