PERALTA, J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45
[1]
 of the Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision
[2]
 dated August 29, 2013 and Resolution
[3]

 dated January 22, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 
101482, which affirmed the Decision dated July 2, 2007 and Resolution 
dated October 31, 2007 of the Office of the President.

 Petitioners Mindanao Shopping Destination Corporation, Ace 
Hardware Philippines, Inc., International Toyworld, Inc., Star Appliance
 Center, Inc., Surplus Marketing Corporation, Watsons Personal Care 
Stores (Philippines), Inc. and Supervalue, Inc. (collectively as 
petitioners) are corporations duly organized and existing under and by 
virtue of Philippine law and engaged in the retail business of selling 
general merchandise within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City.
[4]
 The facts are as follows:
 On November 16, 2005, respondent 
Sangguniang Panglungsod

 of Davao City (
Sanggunian
), after due notice and hearing, enacted the 
assailed Davao City Ordinance No. 158-05, Series of 2005, otherwise 
known as "
An Ordinance Approving the 2005 Revenue Code of the City of Davao, as Amended
â
[5]
 attested to by Vice-Mayor Hon. Luis B. Bonguyan (respondent Vice-Mayor), as Presiding Officer of the 
Sanggunian
,
 and approved by then City Mayor, Hon. Rodrigo R. Duterte, now the 
President of the Republic of the Philippines. The Ordinance took effect 
after the publication in the 
Mindanao Mercury Times
, a newspaper of general circulation in Davao City, for three (3) consecutive days, December 23, 24 and 25, 2005.
[6]
 Petitioners' particular concern is Section 69 (d)
[7]
 of the questioned Ordinance which provides: 



 Section 69. 
Imposition of Tax. 
There is hereby imposed on 
the following persons who establish, operate, conduct or maintain their 
respective business within the City a graduated business tax in the 
amounts prescribed: 


 x x x x


 (d) On Retailers






Gross Sales/Receipts for the Preceding Year


Rates of Tax Per Annum






 








More than P50,000 but not over P400,000.00

In excess of P400,000.00

However, 
barangays
 shall have the exclusive power to levy 
taxes on stores where the gross sales or receipts of the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000) subject to 
existing laws and regulations.


 x x x




 Petitioners claimed that they used to pay only 50% of 1% of the 
business tax rate under the old Davao City Ordinance No. 230, Series of 
1990, but in the assailed new ordinance, it will require them to pay a 
tax rate of 1.5%, or an increase of 200% from the previous rate. 
Petitioners believe that the increase is not allowed under Republic Act (
RA
) No. 7160, 
The Local Government Code
 (
LGC
).
 Consequently, invoking the LGC, petitioners appealed to the DOJ, 
docketed as MTO-DOJ Case No. 02-2006, asserting the unconstitutionality 
and illegality of Section 69 (d), for being unjust, excessive, 
oppressive, confiscatory and contrary to the 1987 Constitution and the 
provisions of the LGC. Petitioners prayed that the questioned ordinance,
 particularly Section 69 (d) thereof be declared as null and void 
ab initio
.

 For lack of material time, the appeal was filed and served 
through registered mail. Unfortunately, when the appeal was mailed on 
January 24, 2006, the verification/certification of non-forum shopping 
and the postal money order, covering the payment of filing fees were not
 attached. The attachments were mailed the next day, January 25, 2006, 
together with a covering manifestation. Petitioners received 
respondents' Comment on the appeal on March 2, 2006; and, on June 27, 
2006, petitioners received respondents' manifestation alleging that the 
appeal should be deemed filed out of time for failure to pay the filing 
fees within the prescribed period.
 In a Resolution
[8]
 dated July 12, 2006, the DOJ-OSec dismissed the appeal and denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.
[9]


 Meanwhile, on September 26, 2006, Davao City Ordinance No. 0253, Series of 2006 (
Amended Ordinance
),
 amended Section 69 (d) of the questioned ordinance. In it, tax rate on 
retailers with gross receipts in excess of P400,000.00 was reduced from 
one and one-half percent (1 Â½%) to one and one-fourth percent (1 Â¼% 
Section 69 (d), as amended, now reads:



 (d) On Retailers






Gross Sales/Receipts for the Preceding Year


Rates of Tax Per Annum






 








More than P50,000 but not over P400,000.00 


2% 






In excess of P400,000.00 


1 Â¼ % 






 However, 
barangays
 shall have the exclusive power to levy 
taxes on stores where the gross sales or receipts of the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000) subject to 
existing laws and regulations.




 With the above development, respondents maintained that the 
adjustment in the tax base no longer exceeds the limitation as set forth
 in Section 191 of the LGC considering that the current Davao City tax 
rate of 1.25% on retailers with gross receipts/sales of over P400,000.00
 under the assailed ordinance is way below or 0.25% short of the maximum
 tax rates of 1.5% for cities sanctioned by the LGC. Respondents insist 
that there is thus no increase or adjustment to speak of under the 
premises which is violative of Section 191 of the LGC.
 From the 
dismissal of the appeal and the denial of their motion for 
reconsideration, petitioners filed an appeal before the Office of the 
President (
OP
). On July 2, 2007, the OP, finding no merit on petitioners' appeal, dismissed the latter.
[10]
 Petitioners moved for reconsideration, but was denied anew in a Resolution
[11]
 dated October 31, 2007.
 Unperturbed, petitioners filed a petition for review before the Court of Appeals.
[12]
  On August 29, 2013, in the disputed Decision of the appellate court, the latter dismissed the petition, to wit: 



 
WHEREFORE
, the Petition is 
DISMISSED
. The Decision 
dated July 2, 2007 and the Resolution dated October 31, 2007 of the 
Office of the President in O.P. Case no. 06-L-425 are 
AFFIRMED
. 


SO ORDERED. 
[13]




 Petitioners moved for reconsideration, but were denied in a Resolution
[14]
 dated January 22, 2014. Thus, the instant petition for review on 
certiorari 
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court raising the following issues:



 WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS DESPITE THE PATENT 
ILLEGALITY AND UNCONSTITUTIONALITY, UPHELD THE VALIDITY OF THE ORDINANCE
 AS WELL AS THE LOCAL SANGGUNIAN'S ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF ITS POWER TO 
TAX


 WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT 
ADDRESSING THE MAIN ISSUE RAISED BY PETITIONERS AS A CONSTITUTIONAL 
ISSUE. 


 WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE OVER PROCEDURAL DEFICIENCIES 




 On the procedural issues, We find that at this stage of the 
proceeding, it is futile to belabor on the procedural deficiencies since
 the issue of timeliness of the appeal has become moot and academic 
considering that petitioners' appeal was given due course by the OP. In 
fact, both the OP and the appellate court decided the appeal on the 
merits and not merely on technicality. We will, thus, proceed with the 
substantive issues of the instant case. 
 Petitioners assert that 
although the maximum rate that may be  imposed by cities on retailers 
with gross receipts exceeding P400,000.00 is 1.5% of the gross receipts,
 
the maximum adjustment which can be applied once every five (5) 
years, is only 0.15% or 10% of the maximum rate of 1.5% of the gross 
receipts in accordance with Section 191 of the LGC
. However, 
petitioners lamented that the assailed Ordinance increased the tax rate 
on them, as retailers, by more than the maximum allowable rate of 0.15%,
 from 
50% of 1% (0.5%) of the gross receipts to 1.5% (now, 1.25%). of the gross receipts
, thus, violating Section 191 in relation to Sections 143 and 151 of the Code.

 A perusal of the assailed new ordinance, particularly Section 69 (a) 
and (b) of Davao City Ordinance No. 158-05, Series of 2005, provides:



 Section 69.

however, That the taxes, fees and charges levied and collected by highly

distributed in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 


 
The rates of taxes that the city may levy may exceed the 
maximum rates allowed for the province or municipality by not more than 
fifty percent (50%) except the rates of professional and amusement 
taxes.
[16]




 We disagree.
 Under the old tax ordinance of Davao City, 
Ordinance No. 230, Series of 1990
,
 wholesalers and retailers were grouped as one, thus, the tax base and 
tax rate imposed upon retailers were the same as that imposed upon 
wholesalers. Subsequently, with the implementation of Republic Act No. 
7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of the Philippines, 
the latter authorized a difference in the tax treatment between 
wholesale and retail businesses. Where before under the old tax 
ordinance, Davao City retailers only paid Â½ of 1% of the gross 
sales/receipts exceeding P2,000,000.00, now under the new tax ordinance,
 retailers would have to pay 1.25% of the gross sales/receipts exceeding
 P400,000.00.
 However, it must be emphasized that the assailed 
new tax ordinance is actually the initial implementation by the Davao 
City local government of the tax provisions of R.A 7160 (LGC) 
considering that the old tax ordinance of Davao City was enacted in 
1990, or prior to the effectivity of the LGC on January 1, 1992. It then
 would explain why the old tax ordinance of Davao City lumped under one 
business tax and under the same set of tax rates these two business 
activities - 
retail 
and 
wholesale
. There is no provision under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337,
[17]
 the old LGC, which specifically define these business activities. Under Section 	131 of R.A. 7160,
[18]
 however, 
wholesale
 and
 retail 
are
 now defined, classified and taxed differently. It cannot be said then 
that Davao City, on its own, deliberately grouped these two business 
activities under one business tax. To reiterate, it is only with the 
implementation of R.A. 7160 that these two business activities, 
i.e.
, 
wholesale
 and 
retail
,
 were specifically defined, classified in different categories, and, 
thus, taxed differently. Corollarily, it is only sound that by analogy, 
wholesalers
 and 
retailers

 should likewise be treated and classified differently to provide 
accuracy to the very meaning of its rootword and to give meaning to the 
intention of the law. 
 Thus, considering that 
wholesale
 and 
retail

 were defined and classified differently under the LGC, it is then 
logical that they are, likewise, given separate and distinct tax base.

[19]


 From the foregoing, it can be shown that the assailed ordinance does
 not violate the limitation imposed by Section 191 of the LGC on the 
adjustment of tax rate for the following reasons: 
 
Firstly
,
 Section 191 of the LGC presupposes that the following requirements are 
present for it to apply, to wit: (i) there is a tax ordinance that 
already imposes a tax in accordance with the provisions of the LGC; and 
(ii) there is a second tax ordinance that made adjustment on the tax 
rate fixed by the first tax ordinance. In the instant case, both 
elements are not present.
 As to the first requirement, it cannot 
be said that the old tax ordinance (first ordinance) was imposed in 
accordance with the provisions of the LGC. To reiterate, the old tax 
ordinance of Davao City was enacted before the LGC came into law. Thus, 
the assailed new ordinance, Davao City Ordinance No. 158-05, Series of 
2005 was actually the first to impose the tax on retailers in accordance
 with the provisions of the LGC.
 As to the second requirement, 
the new tax ordinance (second ordinance) imposed the new tax base and 
the new tax rate as provided by the LGC for retailers. It must be 
emphasized that a tax has two components, a tax base and a tax rate. 
However, Section 191 contemplates a situation where there is already an 
existing tax as authorized under the LGC and only a change in the tax 
rate would be effected. Again, the new ordinance Davao City provided, 
not only a tax rate, but also a tax base that were appropriate for 
retailers, following the parameters provided under the LGC. Suffice it 
to say, the second requirement is absent. Thus, given the absence of the
 above two requirements for the application of Section 191 of the LGC, 
there is no reason for the latter to cover a situation where the 
ordinance, as in this case, was an initial implementation of R.A. 7160.
 
Secondly
,
 Section 191 of the LGC will not apply because with the assailed tax 
ordinance, there is no outright or unilateral increase of tax to speak 
of. The resulting increase in the tax rate for retailers was merely 
incidental. When Davao City enacted the assailed ordinance, it merely 
intended to rectify the glaring error in the classification of 
wholesaler and retailer in the old ordinance. Petitioners are retailers 
as contemplated by the LGC. Petitioners never disputed their 
classification as retailers.
[20]

 Thus, being retailers, they are subject to the tax rate provided under 
Section 69 (d) and not under Section 69 (b) of the assailed ordinance. 
In effect, under the assailed ordinance as amended, petitioners as 
retailers are now assessed at the tax rate of one and one-fourth (1 Â¼%) 
percent on their gross sales and not the fifty-five (55%) percent of one
 (1%) percent on their gross sales since the latter tax rate is only 
applicable to wholesalers, distributors, or dealers. The assailed 
ordinance merely imposes and collects the proper and legal tax due to 
the local government pursuant to the LGC. While it may appear that there
 was indeed a significant adjustment on the tax rate of retailers which 
affected the petitioners, it must, however, be emphasized that the 
adjustment was not by virtue of a unilateral increase of the tax rate of
 petitioners as retailers, but again, merely incidental as a result of 
the correction of the classification of wholesalers and retailers and 
its corresponding tax rates in accordance with the provisions of the 
LGC. 
 Indeed, as correctly pointed out by the appellate court, 
Section 191 is a limitation upon the adjustment, specifically on the 
increase in the tax rates imposed by the local government units. We 
quote the appellate court's ruling with approval, to wit: 



 x x x Section 191 has no bearing in the instant case because what 
actually took place in the questioned Ordinance was the correction of an
 erroneous classification, and not, an upward adjustment or increase of 
tax rates. The fact that there occurred an increase in payment due to 
the reclassification is of no moment, because: (1) reclassification is 
not prohibited; (2) reclassification was made to effect a correction; 
and (3) the taxes imposed upon the reclassified taxpayers, was not 
amended or increased from that stated in the Local Government Code. And,
 it is worthwhile to mention that petitioners have not denied that they 
are engaged in the retail business, hence, the reclassification was 
right, proper and legal.
[21]




 Couched in similar conclusion is the ruling of the Office of the 
President where in the same manner it agreed that the adjustment in the 
tax rate of petitioners did not violate the provisions of the LGC and 
the Constitution. The pertinent portion of the decision reads, thus: 



 Secondly, the office 
a quo
 correctly ruled that the City 
Government of Davao merely reclassified taxpayers earlier treated as one
 class into separate classes thus subjecting them to different tax bases
 and tax rates such that "retailers" are no longer treated and taxed in 
the same way as "wholesalers" unlike in the old ordinance. Distinctly 
defined from each other, a different tax treatment for each class of 
taxpayer is reasonable. Such being the case, the maximum tax rate and 
tax base ceilings provided in Section 143, in relation to Section 151 of
 the Local Government Code, is not in point as the 
prohibition/limitation refers to an adjustment or increase in the tax 
rate or tax base for the same class of taxpayer. As held in PLDT, Inc. 
vs. City of Davao (399 SCRA 442), "statutes in derogation of sovereignty
 such as those containing exemption from taxation should be strictly 
construed in favor of the State."
[22]




 
Thirdly
, it must be pointed out that the limitation under 
Section 191 of the LGC was provided to guard against possible abuse of 
the LGU's power to tax.
[23]
 In
 this case, however, strictly speaking, the new tax rate for petitioners
 as retailers under the assailed ordinance is not a case where there was
 an imposition of a new tax rate, rather there is merely a rectification
 of an erroneous classification of taxpayers and tax rates, 
i.e
.,
 of grouping retailers and wholesalers in one category, and their 
corresponding rates. The amendment of the old tax ordinance was not 
intended to abuse the LGU's taxing powers but merely sought to impose 
the rates as provided under the LGC as in fact the tax rate imposed was 
even lower than the rate authorized by the LGC. In effect, the assailed 
ordinance merely corrected the old ordinance so that it will be in 
accord with the LGC. To rule otherwise is tantamount to pronouncing that
 Davao City can no longer correct the apparent error in classifying 
wholesaler and retailer in the same category under its old tax 
ordinance. Such proposition runs counter to the well-entrenched 
principle that
 estoppel 
does not apply to the government, 
especially on matters of taxation. Taxes are the nation's lifeblood 
through which government agencies continue to operate and with which the
 State discharges its functions for the welfare of its constituents.
[24]


 However, while Davao City may rectify and amend their old tax 
ordinance in order to give full implementation of the LGC, it, however, 
cannot impose a straight 1.25% at its initial implementation of the LGC 
in so far as retailers are concerned. Davao City should, at the very 
least, start with 1% (the minimum tax rate) as provided under Section 
143 (d) of the LGC. While Davao City cannot be faulted in failing to 
immediately implement the LGC, petitioners cannot likewise be unjustly 
prejudiced by its initial implementation of the LGC. It is but fair and 
reasonable that Davao City at its initial implementation of the LGC, 
impose the tax rates as provided in Section 143. It is only then that 
the imposition of the tax rate on retailers will not be considered as 
confiscatory or oppressive, considering that the reclassification of 
wholesaler and retailer and their corresponding tax rate being observed 
now is in accord with the LGC. 
 
Furthermore, to clarify, the 
old ordinance, because it remained unchanged until the new tax ordinance
 was enacted in 2005, charged lower tax rates for retailers which 
resulted in lower revenues of Davao City.
 Corollarily, while there 
was an increase in the amount of taxes to be paid by petitioners as 
retailers, it should not be overlooked that the retailer has, in fact, 
benefited already for a long time under the old tax ordinance because it
 paid lower taxes due to Davao City's failure to immediately implement 
the LGC. Davao City has already foregone a substantial loss in revenues 
as a result of an unadjusted lower tax rate for retailers. Thus, 
dictated by justice and fairness, in its initial attempt to implement 
the LGC, Davao City should, at the very least, start with 1% (the 
minimum tax rate) as provided under Section 143 (d) of the LGC. 
Considering that 11 years had already elapsed from its implementing in 
2006, Davao City could adjust its tax rate twice now which will make its
 adjusted tax rate for retailers pegged at 1.2%, in accordance with 
Section 191 of the LGC. To clarify, from 2006-2011 (first 5 years), the 
initial tax rate should start with 1%; from 2011-2016 (next 5 years) - 
1.1%, thus, for the years 2017-2021, the tax adjustment is 1.21%. 
However, for this purpose, Davao City should pass an ordinance to give 
effect to the above-discussed tax adjustments.
 Again, based on 
the foregoing, Davao City merely implemented the LGC, albeit it resulted
 in - an increase in retailer's tax liability - which nevertheless is 
not covered by Section 191 of the LGC. In any case, an ordinance based 
on reasonable classification does not violate the constitutional 
guaranty of the equal protection of the law. The requirements for a 
valid and reasonable classification are: (1) it must rest on substantial
 distinctions; (2) it must be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it 
must not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) it must apply 
equally to all members of the same class. For the purpose of rectifying 
the erroneous classification of wholesaler and retailer in the old 
ordinance in order to conform to the classification and the tax rates as
 imposed by the LGC is neither invalid nor unreasonable. The 
differentiation of wholesaler and retailer conforms to the practical 
dictates of justice and equity and is not discriminatory within the 
meaning of the Constitution. It is inherent in the power to tax that a 
State is free to select the subjects of taxation. Inequities which 
result from a singling out of one particular class for taxation or 
exemption infringe no constitutional limitation.
[25]

 Settled is the rule that every law, in this case an ordinance, is 
presumed valid. To strike down a law as unconstitutional, petitioner has
 the burden to prove a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution,
 which petitioner miserably failed to do.
[26]
 In 
Smart Communications, Inc. v. Municipality of Malvar, Batangas
,
[27]
 citing 
Lawyers Against Monopoly and Poverty (LAMP) v. Secretary of Budget and Management
,
[28]
 the Court held, thus: 



 To justify the nullification of the law or its implementation, 
there must be a clear and unequivocal, not a doubtful, breach of the 
Constitution. In case of doubt in the sufficiency of proof establishing 
unconstitutionality, the Court must sustain legislation because "to 
invalidate [a law] based on x x x baseless supposition is an affront to 
the wisdom not only of the legislature that passed it but also of the 
executive which approved it." This presumption of constitutionality can 
be overcome only by the clearest showing that there was indeed an 
infraction of the Constitution, and only when such a conclusion is 
reached by the required majority may the Court pronounce, in the 
discharge of the duty it cannot escape, that the challenged act must be 
struck down.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
 




 
LEONEN, 
J
.:


 I concur in the result.  
 
 Respectfully, I disagree with the 
ponencia
 's 
conclusion that the tax rate imposed on retailers under Davao City 
Ordinance No. 253, Series of 2006 is "a rectification of an erroneous 
classification of taxpayers and tax rates"
[1]

 under Davao's old tax code. The 1.25% tax levied on retailers is an 
imposition of a new tax. Wholesalers and retailers were not grouped into
 a single category under Davao's 	old 	tax code. 	They were classified 
separately, although taxed with the same rate.  
 
 However, I agree that Davao City, in its initial attempt to 
implement the tax rates under the Local Government Code of 1991 (Local 
Government Code), can impose the minimum tax rate of one percent (1%) on
 retailers reckoned from 2006 to 2011. I also agree that Davao City may 
adjust the tax rate on a staggered basis due to the lapse of a 
considerable length of time from the enactment of its new tax ordinance.
 Hence, the tax rate on retailers should be 1.1% from taxable years 2011
 to 2016 and 1.21% for taxable years 2017 to 2021, in accordance with 
the limitation under Section 191 of the Local Government Code.	  
 
 Section 69(d) of Davao City Ordinance No. 253, Series of 2006, 
which immediately imposed a 1.25% tax rate on retailers, violates the 
Local Government Code in that it exceeds the allowable adjustment of tax
 rates. Any adjustment in the tax rates of local government units must 
conform to the limitations under Section 191 of the Local Government 
Code.
[2]


 To strengthen local autonomy and decentralization and to lessen dependence on the national government,
[3]
 Article X, Section 5 of the Constitution grants local government units the power to create their own sources of revenue.
[4]


 The Local Government Code is an innovative piece of legislation
[5]

 designed to give life to the basic policy of local autonomy. In the 
field of taxation, local government units are given enough flexibility 
to widen their tax base and impose tax rates depending on their 
respective needs.
[6]


 However, the power of local government units to tax is not 
absolute. Rather, it is subject to the statutory guidelines provided by 
Congress.
[7]
 The Local 
Government Code was enacted not just to amplify the power of local 
governments to create their own sources of revenue but also to ensure 
that taxpayers will not be "overburdened or saddled with multiple and 
unreasonable impositions."
[8]
 Thus, the imposition of taxes by local government units is subject to the following common limitations under Sections 130,
[9]
 132,
[10]
 133,
[11]
 and 186
[12]
  of the Local Government Code. 
 
 Cities are granted wide taxing powers. Except in certain 
instances, they can levy taxes, fees, and charges that provinces and 
municipalities may impose.
[13]

 Cities are also authorized to impose tax rates by more than fifty 
percent (50%) of what provinces and municipalities may impose except for
 professional taxes and amusement taxes.
[14]


 	 Cities may levy business taxes under Section 151 in relation 
to Section 143 of the Local Government Code. Section 143 of the Local 
Government Code recognizes distinct types of businesses that are treated
 and taxed differently.
[15]


 Pertinent to this case is the distinction between the tax rates
 imposed on wholesalers and retailers. Section 143, paragraphs (b) and 
(d) of the Local Government Code provides:  
 
 ARTICLE II

The Local Government Code, however, does not prescribe fixed tax 
rates that local government units should impose "but merely specifies 
the minimum and maximum tax rates" that can be imposed.
[16]
 Local government units, through their respective sanggunians, are given wide discretion in determining the actual tax rates.
[17]
 


 The wholesale and retail businesses were categorized differently in Davao's old tax code.
[18]

 Wholesalers were taxed under Section 1(b) while retailers were taxed 
under Section 1(d). Despite this distinction, retailers were 
deliberately taxed in the same manner and at the same rate as 
wholesalers under Davao's old tax code:
[19]


 ARTICLE 5. TAX ON FEES FOR BUSINESS,
 
   TRADE AND OCCUPATION  
 


 Section 1. Business Tax. - There is hereby imposed on the 
following business in the City of Davao an annual tax collectible 
quarterly, except on those for which fixed taxes are already provided 
for as follows: 


. . . .


(b) On WHOLESALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR DEALERS, in any article of 
commerce of whatever kind or nature in accordance with the following 
schedules: 






Gross Sales/Receipts for the Preceding Calendar Year


Amount of Tax Per Annum
 






 


 






. . . . 


 






In excess [of] 2,000,000.00


 


 
At a rate of fifty (50%) percent of one percent (1%)  
         






 (d) On RETAILERS: a
mended as per Ordinance 718, included under paragraph (b) of this section
[20]






 The Local Government Code does not prohibit the imposition of the 
same tax rate on wholesalers and retailers. What is proscribed is the 
imposition of a tax rate greater than that provided by law. Pursuant to 
Section 151
[21]
 in relation to Section 143(d)
[22]

 of the Local Government Code, a city may impose a maximum tax rate of 
1.5% on retailers with gross sales or receipts of more than P400,000.00.
[23]
 Thus, Davao City may increase the tax rate imposed on retailers from the old rate of 50% of 1% or 0.5% to 1.5%. 
 
 Although local government units may adjust their tax rates, 
there are two (2) limitations to this power. The first limitation refers
 to the frequency by which local government units may adjust their tax 
rates. The second limitation pertains to the amount of each adjustment. 
Section 191 of the Local Government Code provides: 
 
 CHAPTER V 

   Miscellaneous Provisions  
 


 . . . .


Section 191. 
Authority of Local Government Units to Adjust Rates of Tax Ordinances
.
 â Local government units shall have the authority to adjust the tax 
rates as prescribed herein not oftener than once every five (5) years, 
but in no case shall such adjustment exceed ten percent (10%) of the 
rates fixed under this Code. 




 Should local government units decide to adjust their tax rates, 
Section 191 of the Local Government Code limits the amount of each 
adjustment and the frequency by which this authority may be exercised. 	
Local government units can only adjust tax rates once every five (5) 
years. Moreover, the amount of adjustment should not exceed ten percent 
(10%) of the rates fixed under the Local Government Code.
[24]


 In its old tax code, Davao City distinguished between 
wholesalers and retailers but deliberately subjected them to the same 
tax rate.
[25]
 The immediate 
imposition of the 1.25% tax rate on retailers under Davao City Ordinance
 No. 158-05, Series of 2005, as amended by City Ordinance No. 253, 
Series of 2006, cannot be considered as a correction of an erroneous 
classification. It is an upward adjustment in the tax rate, which falls 
under Section 191 of the Local Government Code. Assuming that the 
imposition of a 1.25% tax on retailers was brought about by the 
reclassification, it should still be considered as an upward adjustment 
in the tax rate.  
 
 Davao's old tax code was implemented before the effectivity in 
1991 of the Local Government Code, which does not provide any transitory
 provision that creates an exemption for existing ordinances. Any 
amendment introduced to these ordinances will still be subject to the 
limitations under the Local Government Code. The reclassification, which
 aims to conform to the Local Government Code, still results in an 
increase in the tax rate. What cannot be done directly cannot be done 
indirectly. 
 
 Davao City cannot immediately increase the tax rate on 
retailers to 1.25% without violating Section 191 of the Local Government
 Code. Evidently, it will take time before Davao City can impose the 
maximum rate of 1.5% on retailers. However, this is a necessary 
limitation on the local government unit's power of taxation. Otherwise, 
taxpayers will be prejudiced. That Davao City decided to amend its tax 
code 14 years
[26]
 after the effectivity of the Local Government Code cannot justify an immediate increase in its tax rates.  
 
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I concur in the result. Davao City may 
impose a tax rate of one percent (1%) on retailers from taxable years 
2006 to 2011. Davao City may then adjust the tax rate on retailers on a 
staggered basis from 1% to 1.1% for taxable years 2011 to 2016 and from 
1.1% to 1.21% for taxable years 2017 to 2021.

 Local Gov. Code, sec. 151, par. 2 provides:  
 


Section 151.
 Scope of Taxing Powers
. â . . .


The rates of taxes that the city may levy may exceed the maximum 
rates allowed for the province or municipality by not more than fifty 
percent (50%) except the rates of professional and amusement taxes. 




 
[22]
 Local Gov. Code, sec. 143(d), provides:  
 


Section 143.
 Tax on Business.
 â The municipality may impose taxes on the following businesses: 


. . . . 


(d) On retailers. 






With gross sales or receipts for the preceding calendar year of:
 


Rate of Tax Per Annum






 


 






P400,000.00 or less 


2%






more than P400,000.00


 1% 








[23]
 Fifty percent of 1% 
is 0.5%, which is added to the rate imposed by law to arrive at the 
maximum tax rate that a city may impose. This may be summed up using the
 following equation: 0.5(x/100) + x = y, where: 




 x is the rate imposed under the Local Government Code 

     y is the maximum tax rate that a city may impose (multiplied by 100 to arrive at the percentage)
