ELEANOR OLYMPIA-GERONILLA AND EMMA OLYMPIA GUTIERREZ, REPRESENTED BY ATTY. BEATRIZ O. GERONILLA-VILLEGAS, COMPLAINANTS, V. RICARDO V. MONTEMAYOR, JR., SHERIFF IV AND ATTY. LUNINGNING CENTRON, CLERK OF COURT VI AND EX- OFFICIO SHERIFF, RESPONDENTS.


DECISION




PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


The instant administrative case arose from a verified Complaint-Affidavit
[1]

 dated October 15, 2012 for dereliction of duty, serious misconduct, 
negligence, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the service filed by 
complainants Eleanor Olympia-Geronilla and Emma Olympia-Gutierrez, 
represented by Atty. Beatriz O. Geronilla-Villegas (complainants) 
against respondents Sheriff Ricardo V. Montemayor, Jr. (Sheriff 
Montemayor) and Clerk of Court Atty. Luningning Y. Centron (Atty. 
Centron; respondents), both from the Office of the Clerk of Court of the
 Regional Trial Court (OCC-RTC) of Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. 
 The Facts


 Complainants alleged that they are the plaintiffs in an ejectment case entitled "
Eleanor Olympia and Emma Olympia v. Carlito Aceveda and Tolentino Malinao
,"
 docketed as Civil Case No. 327 (ejectment case) filed before the First 
Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Province of Oriental Mindoro (MCTC).
[2]
 On October 29, 2004, Judge Edgardo M. Padilla (Judge Padilla) of the MCTC rendered a Decision
[3]

  in favor of complainants, directing defendants therein	Carlito 	T. 
Aceveda (Aceveda), Tolentino Malinao (Malinao; defendants), and all 
persons claiming rights under them to: (
a
) vacate the property subject of the dispute; (
b
) remove whatever structures they may have erected thereon, at their own expense; (
c
)
 pay complainants P50,000.00 every four (4) months beginning November 
2002 as reasonable compensation for the value of the crops being 
appropriated by defendants until they surrender possession to 
complainants; and (d) pay P30,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs of 
suit.
[4]


 In view of the MCTC's favorable decision, complainants filed a
 Motion for Immediate Execution thereof; on the other hand, defendants 
appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Calapan City, Branch 40 (RTC).
[5]
 
 Meanwhile, on July 1, 2005, the MCTC issued a Writ of Execution
[6]
 directing the implementation of its October 29, 2004 Decision.
[7]
 Subsequently, in a Decision
[8]
 dated May 4, 2007, the RTC denied defendants' appeal and affirmed the MCTC's Decision 
in toto
. Defendants' motion for reconsideration was denied in an Order
[9]
 dated May 28, 2007.
[10]


 Notwithstanding the RTC's affirmance of the MCTC's Decision 
and the issuance of a writ of execution, the judgment in favor of the 
complainants remained unsatisfied. Thus, they filed an Urgent Motion for
 Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution, which the MCTC granted. An alias 
writ of execution
[11]
  was issued on July 29, 2010.
[12]

 Aceveda refused to vacate the premises despite the issuance of the 
alias writ of execution. Upon Sheriff Montemayor's instruction, 
complainants filed a motion for the issuance of a Writ of Demolition, 
which the MCTC granted. On May 20, 2011, a Writ of Demolition
[13]
 was issued.
[14]

 From the issuance of the Writ of Demolition on May 20, 2011 to November
 2011, complainants consistently and religiously coordinated with 
Sheriff Montemayor for the enforcement of the MCTC Decision. However, 
the latter informed them that he could not enforce the said writ upon 
the portion of the property occupied by Aceveda as the same was excluded
 from the scope of the judgment. Sheriff Montemayor declared that 
Aceveda was able to produce "believable" documents from the Department 
of Agrarian Reform (DAR) tending to show his ownership over the portion 
of the land upon which he had constructed his house. Thus, Sheriff 
Montemayor advised complainants to conduct a resurvey to ascertain the 
boundaries of the property that should be included in the demolition.
[15]
 

 Complainants insisted that all issues pertaining to the subject 
property, particularly the portion being claimed by Aceveda, had already
 been settled in the ejectment case. As such, all that Sheriff 
Montemayor had to do was to enforce the judgment therein. Unfortunately,
 the latter refused to do so, prompting complainants to send a letter 
dated November 22, 2011 to Atty. Centron, informing her of Sheriff 
Montemayor's unjustified refusal to perform his duty of implementing the
 MCTC Decision. In the letter, complainants mentioned Sheriff 
Montemayor's receipt of the amount of P10,000.00 allegedly as 
operational expenses for the intended demolition.
[16]

 On December 23, 2011, Sheriff Montemayor advised complainants that he 
had scheduled the demolition on December 27, 2011 and asked for 
additional funds. Acceding to the request in the hope that the favorable
 decision will finally be enforced, complainants gave the amount of 
P15,000.00 to Sheriff Montemayor, for which the latter signed an 
acknowledgment receipt.
[17]

 Unfortunately, the scheduled demolition did not push through because of
 alleged flooding in Baco, Oriental Mindoro. Nonetheless, Sheriff 
Montemayor assured complainants that he will undertake the demolition on
 January 2, 2012, which never transpired at all. Instead, he suggested 
that complainants secure permission from the Department of Environment 
and Natural Resources-Community Environment and Natural Resources Office
 (DENR-CENRO) to cover the improvements on the portion of the premises 
occupied by Aceveda. Despite the cancellation of the demolition, Sheriff
 Montemayor failed to return the P15,000.00 given to him as expenses 
therefor. 
 Complainants reported
[18]

 the matter to Atty. Centron, who, however, failed to take appropriate 
action on Sheriff Montemayor's unwarranted refusal to carry out the 
demolition. Hence, the instant administrative case against both Sheriff 
Montemayor and Atty. Centron for dereliction of duty, serious 
misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the service. 
 In his defense,
[19]

 Sheriff Montemayor denied having received the amount of P10,000.00 as 
alleged operational funds for the demolition, maintaining that there was
 no proof of his receipt thereof other than complainants' bare 
allegation.
[20]
 However, he 
admitted receipt of the P15,000.00, which he claimed was distributed as 
financial assistance among the Mangyans who voluntarily agreed to vacate
 and remove their structures on the subject premises.
[21]
 He argued that, contrary to complainants' allegation, Section 10,
[22]

 Rule 141 of the Rules of Court on sheriffs fees did not apply in this 
case as the P15,000.00 that he received and gave as financial assistance
 to the Mangyans cannot be considered as sheriff's fees.
[23]

 As regards his refusal to demolish Aceveda's structure on the premises,
 he explained that he had doubts on whether Aceveda's house was truly 
within complainants' property. It was because of this uncertainty that 
he advised complainants to conduct a resurvey of the property, but they 
never cooperated.
[24]
 
 For her part, Atty. Centron asserted
[25]

 that she never tolerated Sheriff Montemayor's alleged dereliction of 
duty nor did she fail to act on complainants' concerns after they were 
brought to her attention. In fact, she gave Sheriff Montemayor written 
directives to carry out the writ of demolition and even reminded him of 
the money judgment contained in the MCTC's Decision, which he must also 
enforce in favor of complainants. Likewise, in light of Sheriff 
Montemayor's advice to conduct a resurvey, Atty. Centron sought 
complainants' cooperation by asking that they provide a surveyor for the
 expeditious resolution of the matter.
[26]

 Atty. Centron pointed out that the delays attendant to the demolition 
were caused by Sheriff Montemayor's belief that Acevedo's house was not 
within the property of complainants, at the same time maintaining that 
he (Sheriff Montemayor) never deliberately intended to obstruct or cause
 such delay.
[27]
 
 The Report and Recommendation of the 

    Office of the Court Administrator


 In its Report
[28]
 dated January 13, 2017, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended, 
inter alia
,
 that Sheriff Montemayor be found guilty of dereliction of duty, grave 
misconduct, and dishonesty, and fined in the amount of P40,000.00 in 
view of his previous dismissal from the service. Likewise, the OCA 
recommended that Atty. Centron be held liable for simple neglect of duty
 and fined in the amount of P10,000.00, with a stem warning that a 
repetition of the same or any similar act shall be dealt with more 
severely.
[29]


 In its evaluation, the OCA held that Sheriff Montemayor 
exceeded his authority and substituted his own judgment when he deferred
 the implementation of the writ of demolition based on his own belief 
that the property in dispute had to be resurveyed, forgetting that a 
sheriff has no discretion on whether to execute a judgment or not. 
Neither can he choose as to which portion of a property should be 
included or excluded in the execution.
[30]

 With respect to his receipt of the aggregate amount of P25,000.00 from 
complainants, the OCA found no proof that Sheriff Montemayor indeed 
received the initial amount of P10,000.00. With regard, however, to the 
amount of P15,000.00 which he 
admittedly
 received, the OCA did 
not give credence to his allegation that the said amount was distributed
 to the Mangyans. Instead, it found him liable for violation of the 
procedural steps that sheriffs are mandated to comply with relative to 
the fees and expenses in implementing court processes, pursuant to 
Section 10, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court. In particular, Sheriff 
Montemayor did not secure court approval with respect to the P15,000.00 
he admittedly received, which is tantamount to an unlawful exaction, 
thereby making him administratively liable.
[31]


 In sum, the OCA found Sheriff Montemayor liable for 
dereliction of duty on account of his failure and refusal to enforce the
 writ of execution and writ of demolition. For demanding and receiving 
money without court approval in violation of Section 10, Rule 141 of the
 Rules of Court, he is liable as well for grave misconduct and 
dishonesty, for which the prescribed penalty is dismissal. However, in 
light of his previous dismissal from the service,
[32]

 the OCA recommended that he instead be fined in the amount of 
P40,000.00, which shall be deducted from the monetary value of his 
accumulated leave credits, if sufficient; otherwise, he shall pay said 
amount directly to the Court.
[33]

 Similarly, the OCA found Atty. Centron remiss in the performance of her
 duties as Clerk of Court in view of her failure to effectively 
supervise Sheriff Montemayor in carrying out his tasks. While it may be 
true that she had called his attention by directing and/or reminding him
 to enforce the writ of demolition in this case, her failure to 
effectively address the matter that complainants had brought to her 
attention makes her liable for simple neglect of duty, for which the OCA
 recommended the alternative penalty of fine in the amount of P10,000.00
 in lieu of suspension to prevent undue adverse effect on public 
service.
[34]
 
 The Issue Before the Court


 The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not 
respondents Sheriff Montemayor and Atty. Centron should be held 
administratively liable, as recommended by the OCA. 
 The Court's Ruling


 The Court concurs with the findings and conclusions of the OCA. 
In 
Lucas v. Dizon
,
[35]
 the Court declared: 
  


 The last standing frontier that the victorious litigant must 
face is often another difficult process - the execution stage. In this 
stage, a litigant who has won the battle might lose the war. Thus, the 
sheriffs, being agents of the court, play an important role, 
particularly in the matter of implementing the writ of execution. 
Indeed, [sheriffs] "are tasked to execute final judgments of courts. If 
not enforced, such decisions are empty victories of the prevailing 
parties. They must therefore comply with their 
mandated ministerial duty to implement writs promptly and expeditiously
.
 As agents of the law, sheriffs are called upon to discharge their 
duties with due care and utmost diligence because in serving the court's
 writs and processes and implementing its order, they cannot afford to 
err without affecting the integrity of their office and the efficient 
administration of justice."
[36]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Engraved in jurisprudence is the rule that the sheriff's duty in the execution of a writ is 
purely ministerial
.
 Once the writ is placed in his or her hands, a sheriff is obligated to 
execute the order of the court strictly to the letter and with 
reasonable promptness, taking heed of the prescribed period required by 
the Rules.
[37]


 In this case, Sheriff Montemayor's mandated task was to 
implement the MCTC's Decision in favor of complainants. However, instead
 of doing so, he substituted his own judgment and acted on his own 
belief that a specific portion of the subject property should be 
excluded from the execution. He refused to demolish the house of 
defendant Aceveda and vehemently insisted that the subject property must
 first be resurveyed, unduly causing delay in the implementation of the 
MCTC Decision, to the prejudice of the prevailing parties, 
i.e
., the complainants. 
  
 Sheriff Montemayor's failure to enforce the alias writ of 
execution and writ of demolition clearly renders him liable for 
dereliction of duty. He overstepped his authority and conveniently 
overlooked the ministerial nature of a sheriffs duty in the execution of
 judgments. Instead of enforcing the MCTC's orders, he exercised his 
discretion and supplanted his own judgment for that of the court's. To 
reiterate, the duty of a sheriff to execute a writ is purely 
ministerial, and he has no discretion to delay the execution thereof. 
Absent
 any instruction by a court to the contrary, he is mandated to proceed 
with reasonable celerity and promptness in implementing the writ.
[38]
 If for any reason, he cannot do so in part or in full, his duty is outlined in Section 14,
[39]
 Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which, unfortunately, he likewise failed to observe. 
  
 As regards the amount of P15,000.00 that Sheriff Montemayor 
had admittedly received from complainants as additional expenses for the
 cancelled demolition and which he claimed had been distributed among 
the Mangyans who voluntarily vacated the premises, the Court concurs 
with the OCA's finding that the said money was beyond the ambit of 
allowable fees that a sheriff may receive in the implementation of 
writs. Moreover, Sheriff Montemayor failed to observe the following 
procedure laid down in Section 10, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court with 
respect to sheriff's expenses: (1) the sheriff is required to secure the
 court's prior approval of the estimated expenses and fees needed to 
implement the court process; (2) the requesting party shall deposit such
 amount with the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff, who shall 
disburse the same to the executing sheriff subject to his liquidation 
within the same period for rendering a return on the process or writ; 
and (3) any unspent amount shall be refunded to the requesting party who
 made the deposit. 
  
  
 Indisputably, the sum of P15,000.00 received by Sheriff 
Montemayor without the approval of the court cannot be considered as 
lawful sheriff's fees. As such, his receipt thereof is tantamount to an 
unlawful exaction for which he must be held liable for grave misconduct 
and dishonesty.
[40]
 A 
sheriff's conduct of unilaterally demanding sums of money from a 
party-litigant purportedly to defray expenses of execution, without 
obtaining the approval of the trial court for such supposed expense and 
without rendering an accounting constitutes dishonesty and extortion and
 falls short of the required standards of public service. Such conduct 
threatens the very existence of the system of administration of justice.
[41]

 Grave misconduct and dishonesty are grave offenses each punishable by 
dismissal on the first offense under Section 46 (A), Rule 10 of the 
Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS).
[42]

 Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is likewise a 
grave offense which carries the penalty of suspension for six (6) months
 and one (1) day to one (1) year, and dismissal on the second offense. 
However, as records show that Sheriff Montemayor had been previously 
meted the penalty of dismissal,
[43]

 the Court instead imposes on him the penalty of fine in the amount of 
P40,000.00, which amount shall be deducted from the monetary value of 
his accrued credit leaves, if sufficient; otherwise, he shall pay the 
amount directly to the Court. 
 Similarly, Atty. Centron should be
 held administratively liable for her failure to take a more decisive 
action against Sheriff Montemayor's unwarranted refusal to enforce the 
MCTC Decision in favor of complainants. Although she may have advised 
and/or reminded him with respect to the performance of his duties, her 
apparently lackadaisical attitude in this matter evinces a similar 
failure on her part to perform her duty of effectively supervising him. 
Moreover, instead of taking Sheriff Montemayor's stance that a resurvey 
should be conducted on the subject property based on his groundless 
belief that a portion thereof should be excluded from the judgment, she 
should have firmly reminded him of his mandated ministerial task of 
implementing writs promptly and expeditiously, and that he had no 
discretion with regard to the merits of the judgment. Atty. Centron's 
failure in this respect renders her administratively liable for simple 
neglect of duty. 
 Simple neglect of duty is defined as the 
failure of an employee to give attention to a task expected of him and 
signifies a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or 
indifference,
[44]
 a less grave
 offense punishable by suspension from office for one (1) month and one 
(1) day to six (6) months for the first offense, and dismissal for the 
second offense under Section 46 (D) of the RRACCS. However, the Court, 
in several cases,
[45]
 imposed 
the penalty of fine in lieu of suspension as an alternative penalty in 
order to prevent any undue adverse effect on public service which would 
ensue if work were otherwise left unattended by reason of respondent's 
suspension. Therefore, the Court imposes on Atty. Centron the penalty of
 fine in the amount of P10,000.00, with a stern warning that a 
repetition of the same or any similar act shall be dealt with more 
severely. 
 
WHEREFORE
, respondent Ricardo V. 
Montemayor, Jr., Sheriff IV of the Office of the Clerk of Court, 
Regional Trial Court, Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro is found 
GUILTY

 of dereliction of duty, grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct 
prejudicial to the best interest of the service. In view of his previous
 dismissal from the service, he is 
FINED
 in the amount 
of P40,000.00, to be deducted from the monetary value of his accumulated
 leave credits, if sufficient; otherwise, he is ordered to pay the said 
amount directly to the Court. Likewise, respondent Atty. Luningning Y. 
Centron, Clerk of Court VI of the same office is found 
GUILTY
 of simple neglect of duty and 
FINED
 in the amount of P10,000.00 and 
STERNLY WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or any similar act shall be dealt with more severely.
