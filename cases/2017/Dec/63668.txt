D E C I S I O N




REYES, JR., J:


 These are four administrative complaints that were separately 
filed with the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the
 Philippines (IBP) by and against substantially the same parties, 
particularly:




(1)


 
CBD Case No. 11-3215 for 
gross immorality, malpractice and gross misconduct filed by Atty. Rosita
 L. Dela Fuente-Torres (Atty. Torres). et al., against Atty. Bayani P. 
Dalangin (Atty. Dalangin) and docketed before the Court as A.C. No. 
10758:






 


 






(2)


 
CBD Case No. 12-3292 for gross 
misconduct filed by Glenda Alvaro (Alvaro) against Atty. Dalangin and 
docketed before the Court as A.C. No. 10759; 






 


 






(3) 


CBD Case No. 12-3369 for gross 
misconduct, violation of the lawyer's oath and violation of Canon 1 of 
the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) filed by Atty. Dalangin 
against Atty. Torres and Atty. Avelino Andres (Atty. Andres), docketed 
in this Court as A.C. No. 10760; and 






 


 






(4)


 
CBD Case No. 12-3458 for grave 
misconduct, dishonesty and violation of Canon 1 of the CPR filed by 
Atty. Dalangin against Atty. Torres and docketed in this Court as A.C. 
No. 10761.






The Antecedents


 
A.C. No. 10758


 CBD Case No. 11-3215 is a complaint
[1]

 for gross immorality, malpractice and gross misconduct filed against 
Atty. Dalangin by the following complainants: (1) Atty. Torres (2) 
Felicidad O. Samatra (Samatra); (3) Alvaro; (4) Mary DF. Noveras 
(Noveras); and (5) Generosa S. Camacho (Camacho).
[2]


 The complaint imputed upon Atty. Dalangin several breaches of his duties as a lawyer. 
First
,
 it was alleged that Atty. Dalangin filed against employees of the 
Judiciary and a fellow lawyer groundless suits, which were merely 
prompted by his loss in a case and intended to cover up his negligence 
as counsel. By his acts, Atty. Dalangin committed gross misconduct, and 
breached Rule 18.03, Canon 18, Rules 1.02 and 1.03, Canon 1, and Canon 
11 of the CPR.
[3]
 It 
appeared that prior to the institution of CBD Case No. 11-3215, a 
complaint for disbarment was filed against Atty. Torres by Apolonia 
Marzan (Marzan) and Melody Valdez (Valdez), who were clients of Atty. 
Dalangin and the losing parties in an unlawful detainer case decided by 
Presiding Judge Efren B. Mallare (Judge Mallare) of the Municipal Trial 
Court (MTC) of Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija. Marzan and Valdez later 
disclosed to Atty. Torres that the filing of the disbarment case was 
orchestrated by Atty. Dalangin, who prepared the affidavit and 
instructed them to sign it even without explaining the contents and 
tenor of the document. 
 When Marzan and Valdez eventually 
realized that their affidavit was used to file a disbarment complaint 
with the IBP against Atty. Torres, they decided to terminate the 
services of Atty. Dalangin. By their new counsel's advice, Marzan and 
Valdez stopped attending the disbarment hearings, and the case was 
eventually dismissed by the IBP. Atty. Dalangin also caused Marzan and 
Valdez's filing of administrative cases against Judge Mallare and 
Noveras, as the Clerk of Court of the MTC, which complaints were 
nonetheless likewise dismissed by the Supreme Court upon the IBP's  
recommendation.
[4]
 
Second
,
 Atty. Dalangin was accused of maintaining an illicit and immoral affair
 with one Julita Pascual (Pascual), a clerk at the Public Attorney's 
Office (PAO) in Talavera, Nueva Ecija, where Atty. Dalangin previously 
worked as district public attorney. After Atty. Dalangin had left PAO, 
he retained Pascual as his private secretary, who still remained to be 
employed with PAO. Atty. Dalangin and Pascual had a daughter whom they 
named Julienne, even when each of them had existing marriages with some 
other persons.
[5]
 The affair 
between Atty. Dalangin and Pascual, and the paternity of Julienne, were 
known to the community, especially the courts.
[6]

 Julienne was nonetheless entered in the civil registry as Pascual and 
her legal husband's own child so as to conceal the fact that Atty. 
Dalangin was the real father.
[7]
 The foregoing acts allegedly breached Rule 1.01, Canon 1, and Rule 7.03, Canon 7 of the CPR.
  
 
Third
, Atty. Dalangin was accused of malpractice for 
acts that dated back to his prior employment with PAO. He allegedly 
collected attorney's fees from indigent litigants who sought his 
assistance, like complainant Camacho from whom he demanded an acceptance
 fee of P8,000.00. When Camacho explained that he could only produce 
P3,000.00, Atty. Dalangin threw the case records on a table and 
retorted, "
Mabubuhay ba naman ang abogado [dito]
."
[8]

  Without prior authority from his superiors, Atty. Dalangin also 
willfully appeared in areas outside his jurisdiction as a district 
public attorney.
[9]


 
Fourth
, the complaint included charges that pertained
 to Atty. Dalangin's handling of his court cases. It was claimed that 
Atty. Dalangin misquoted jurisprudence in a pleading he filed in court, 
which act constituted a breach of Rule 10.02, Canon 10 of the CPR.
[10]

 In a case for robbery filed by Samatra against Pascual, Atty. Dalangin 
also wielded his influence and prepared perjured statements from 
supposed witnesses, a clear violation of Rule 10.02, Canon 10 of the 
CPR.
[11]
 Finally, Atty. 
Dalangin violated Rule 10.01, Canon 10 of the CPR when he submitted in a
 civil case fraudulent and misleading evidence, particularly a 
certificate of title without the page reflecting the annotations 
pertinent to the case.
[12]


 Atty. Dalangin filed his Answer and refuted all charges.
[13]

 He denied having a hand in the preparation of the disbarment complaint 
against Atty. Torres, as he argued that neither his name nor his 
signature appeared in the records thereof. His relationship with 
Pascual, on the other hand, was only maliciously misinterpreted. He was 
only a close friend of the Pascuals, and some of Pascual's children, 
including Julienne, were his godchildren.
[14]
 

 Atty. Dalangin likewise denied the claim that he collected attorney's 
fees while he worked as a PAO lawyer. Although he admitted appearing as a
 public attorney in an area that was beyond his jurisdiction, the 
appearance was with the Regional Public Attorney's verbal authority, 
claimed by Atty. Dalangin to be sufficient under office practice.
[15]

 Finally, the alleged mistakes that he committed as counsel in specific 
cases' presentation of evidence had been rectified in court.
[16]
 
 
A.C. No. 10759
 CBD Case No. 12-3292, a complaint
[17]

 for gross misconduct, was filed by Alvaro against Atty. Dalangin for an
 incident that happened on the morning of November 14, 2011, while 
Alvaro was waiting for the start of a hearing at the lobby of the 
Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 37, Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija. Upon 
seeing Alvaro, Atty. Dalangin allegedly hurled slanderous and defamatory
 remarks against her, as he spoke at the top of his voice and referred 
to her as a "certified swindler." He also confronted and threatened 
Alvaro for her participation in the filing of CBD Case No. 11-3215, and 
then precluded her from visiting the PAO in Talavera, Nueva Ecija. Atty.
 Dalangin's tirade was heard and witnessed by several persons, and some 
of them executed their respective affidavits
[18]

 to narrate the incident. The foregoing impelled Alvaro to seek Atty. 
Dalangin's disbarment for a violation of Rules 1.01 and 1.02, Canon 1, 
Rule 7.03, Canon 7, and Rule 8.02, Canon 8 of the CPR.
 While Atty. Dalangin admitted in his Answer
[19]

 the alleged confrontation, he denied shouting invectives at Alvaro. 
When he talked to Alvaro, he merely confronted her for what he claimed 
were lies declared in her affidavit in CBD Case No. 11-3215. Atty. 
Dalangin also warned to seek legal remedies should Alvaro fail to 
substantiate the truth of her testimonies. 
 Atty. Dalangin also 
admitted that he precluded Alvaro from visiting PAO, but explained that 
this was prompted by his knowledge that Alvaro was a fixer, who used the
 name of the office and demanded money from indigent clients. For Atty. 
Dalangin, Alvaro filed this complaint to get back at Atty. Dalangin for 
banning her at the PAO and depriving her of earning from her illegal 
activities.
[20]
 
A.C. No. 10760
 
 The two other complaints, CBD Case No. 12-3369 and CBD Case No. 12-3458, were instituted by Atty. Dalangin. 
 In CBD Case No. 12-3369,
[21]

 Atty. Dalangin sought the disbarment of Atty. Torres and Atty. Andres 
for gross misconduct, violation of the lawyer's oath, and breach of 
Rules 1.01 and 1.02, Canon 1 of the CPR. He claimed that both lawyers 
conspired with their clients in filing CBD Case No. 11-3215, even as 
they violated Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4200, otherwise known as the 
Anti-Wiretapping Act.
 Submitted to support CBD Case No. 11-3215 
was Nonilo Alejo's (Alejo) affidavit, which contained a transcript of a 
recorded telephone conversation between Alejo and one Wilma Pineda 
(Pineda).
[22]
 The recording was without the prior knowledge and consent of Pineda.
[23]
 

 As a backgrounder, Atty. Dalangin was accused in CBD Case No. 11-3215 
of fabricating testimonies against Noveras, who was claimed to be a 
vital witness in a criminal case against Pascual. In an affidavit 
drafted by Atty. Dalangin for Pineda, the latter complained of Noveras 
and Alejo's failure to return in full the cash bond that she posted in a
 case for violation of the Bouncing Checks Law, even after the case had 
been dismissed by the trial court. This allegation was negated in the 
disputed transcript, as Pineda allegedly confirmed receiving the full 
P8,000.00, but decided to give half thereof to Alejo for a "blow-out" 
after her case's dismissal.
[24]
 

 Both Atty. Andres and Atty. Torres disputed the complaint. Atty. Andres
 asserted that CBD Case No. 12-3369 was filed only to harass and 
intimidate him, being the counsel of the complainants in CBD Case No. 
11-3215.
[25]
 By way of defense, he adopted a counter-affidavit
[26]

 which he submitted in a separate complaint for violation of R.A. No. 
4200 that was filed by Atty. Dalangin with the City Prosecutor of Pasig 
City. Atty. Andres therein argued that on the basis of Atty. Dalangin's 
allegations, the case should have been filed by Pineda against Alejo, 
being the purported victim and the one who recorded the conversation, 
respectively.
 Atty. Torres, on the other hand, pointed out that 
Atty. Dalangin's reference to R.A. No. 4200 was tantamount to an 
admission that the conversation actually transpired. This only confirmed
 a fault committed by Atty. Dalangin for the fabrications in Pineda's 
earlier affidavit, which was executed purposely to destroy the 
credibility of Noveras. The submission of the transcript was necessary 
because Atty. Dalangin's malpractice was one of the main causes of 
action in CBD Case No. 11-3215.
[27]

 Moreover, the record of the conversation between Alejo and Pineda could
 not be considered a violation of R.A. No. 4200 because no wire or cable
 was used to tap their cellular phones. Neither party in the 
conversation also complained of a supposed wiretapping.
[28]
 
A.C. No. 10761
 The complaint
[29]

 docketed as CBD Case No. 12-3458 was filed solely against Atty. Torres 
for grave misconduct, dishonesty for violation of Article 183
[30]
 of the Revised Penal Code, and breach of Canon 1 of the CPR.
 Atty. Dalangin faulted Atty. Torres for submitting in CBD Case No. 11-3215 Marzan and Valdez's affidavit,
[31]

 which allegedly contained untruthful statements. Marzan and Valdez knew
 from the beginning that they were complainants in a disbarment case 
against Atty. Torres. Atty. Torres, however, later made them issue the 
perjured statements by using as a leverage her own complaint
[32]

 for perjury against Marzan and Valdez, who were then pressured to sign 
the affidavits in exchange for the perjury case's dismissal.
[33]
 In her Answer
[34]

 to the complaint, Atty. Torres insisted on the truth of the statements 
made by Marzan and Valdez in their affidavit in CBD Case No. 11-3215.
 
Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner


 The four administrative complaints were eventually consolidated and jointly resolved by the IBP.

 After the parties' filing of their respective position papers and the 
conduct of a series of hearings, Investigating Commissioner Honesto A. 
Villamor (Investigating Commissioner) issued a Consolidated Report and 
Recommendation
[35]
 dated 
February 11, 2013, which found sufficient bases for Atty. Dalangin's 
suspension from the practice of law for three years. Atty. Dalangin's 
charges against Atty. Dela Torres and Atty. Andres, on the other hand, 
were recommended for dismissal.
 Thus, the Investigating Commissioner's Consolidated Report and Recommendation ended as follows:
  


 WHEREFORE, under the foregoing, finding that Respondent Bayani 
P. Dalangin violated the provisions of the [CPR] and his Lawyer's Oath 
specifically on Gross Immorality, and Gross Misconduct in CBD Case No. 
11-3215 and CBD Case No. 12-3292, it is recommended that said Respondent
 be suspended from the practice of law for the period of three (3) years
 from receipt of the order with a warning that similar offense in the 
future will be dealt with more severely.


 It is further recommended that the charges against Respondent 
Rosita L. dela Fuente Torres and Respondent Avelino Andres in CBD Case 
No. 12-3369 and CBD Case No. 12-3458, for lack of merit be ordered 
dismissed.


 RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.
[36]




 
Recommendation of the IBP Board of Governors


 On June 21, 2013, the IBP Board of Governors issued Resolution No. XX-2013-768,
[37]
 which adopted and approved the Investigating Commissioner's Consolidated Report and Recommendation. The resolution reads: 
  


 RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby unanimously 
ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating
 Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this 
Resolution as Annex "A", and finding the recommendation fully supported 
by the evidence on record and the applicable laws and rules and 
considering that Respondent Dalangin is guilty of gross immorality and 
gross misconduct, Atty. Bayani P. Dalangin is hereby 
SUSPENDED from the practice of law for three (3) years with Warning

 that repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more 
severely. The case against Atty. Rosita L. dela [Fuente] Torres and 
Atty. Manuel Andres is hereby 
DISMISSED
.
[38]




 Atty. Dalangin filed a motion for reconsideration, but this was denied by the IBP Board of Governors in a Resolution
[39]
 dated August 8, 2014, which reads: 
  


 RESOLVED to DENY Respondent/Complainant Dalangin's Motion for 
Reconsideration there being no cogent reason to reverse the findings of 
the Commission and the Resolution subject of the motion, it being a mere
 reiteration of the matters which had already been threshed out and 
taken into consideration. Thus, Resolution No. XX-2013-768 dated June 1,
 2013 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
[40]




 On February 26, 2015, Atty. Dominic C. M. Solis, Director for Bar 
Discipline, IBP Commission on Bar Discipline, transmitted the case 
records to the Court pursuant to Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court.
[41]
 On even date and before the Court could have rendered its final action on the disbarment complaints against Atty. Dalangin 
vis-a-vis 
the records forwarded by the IBP, Atty. Dalangin forthwith filed with the Court a Petition for Review,
[42]
 which questioned the IBP resolutions that, 
first
, declared him administratively liable in CBD Case Nos. 11-3215 and 12-3292, and 
second
, dismissed his complaints against Atty. Torres and Atty. Andres in CBD Case Nos. 12-3369 and 12-3458.
  
 In a Resolution
[43]
 
dated June 16, 2015, the Court consolidated these cases and, without 
giving due course to the petition for review, required the filing of 
Comments on the petition. Accordingly, a Consolidated Comment on the 
Petition
[44]
 dated August 5, 
2015 was filed by Andres & Associates Law Office, as counsel for 
Atty. Torres, et al., being the complainants in CBD Case Nos. 11-3215 
and 12-3292, and respondents in CBD Case Nos. 12-3369 and 12-3458. 	
Thereafter, Atty. Dalangin filed his Reply
[45]
 to the consolidated comment.
 
The Court's Ruling


Procedure from Resolutions
 
    of the IBP Board of Governors


 The Court finds it appropriate to first address the matter of Atty. Dalangin's immediate recourse to the Court 
via

 a petition for review that questioned the IBP Board of Governors' 
resolve to affirm the Investigating Commissioner's 	recommendation	on 	
his 	administrative liability,  notwithstanding the fact that the Court 
had not yet taken a final action on the complaints.
  
 When the administrative complaints were resolved by the IBP 
and the instant petition for review was filed in Court, the procedure 
from resolutions of the IBP Board of Governors in administrative cases 
was as provided in the former Section 12 of Rule 139-B of the Rules of 
Court, prior to the amendments introduced by Bar Matter No. 1645 dated 
October 13, 2015. The old rule read:
  


 
Section 12.
 
Review and decision by the Board of Governors
.






a) 


Every case heard by an 
investigator shall be reviewed by the IBP Board of Governors upon the 
record and evidence transmitted to it by the Investigator with his 
report. The decision of the Board upon such review shall be in writing 
and shall clearly and distinctly state the facts and the reasons on 
which it is based. It shall be promulgated within a period not exceeding
 thirty (30) days from the next meeting of the Board following the 
submittal of the Investigator's report. 






b)


 
If the Board, by the vote of a majority of its total membership, determines that the 
respondent
 should be suspended from the practice of law or disbarred, it shall 
issue a resolution setting forth its findings and recommendations which,
 together with the whole record of the case, shall forthwith be 
transmitted to the Supreme Court for 
final action
.






c)


 
If the 
respondent is exonerated by 
the Board or the disciplinary sanction imposed by it is less than 
suspension or disbarment (such as admonition, reprimand, or fine) it 
shall issue a decision exonerating respondent or imposing such sanction.
 The case shall be deemed terminated unless upon petition of the 
complainant or other interested party filed with the Supreme Court 
within fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board's resolution, the Supreme Court orders otherwise. 






d)


 
Notice of the resolution or decision 
of the Board shall be given to all parties through their counsel. A copy
 of the same shall be transmitted to the Supreme Court. (Emphases 
supplied)








In B.M. No. 1755 captioned 
Re: Clarification of Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Bar Discipline
,
 the Court applied this provision to address the issue therein involved,
 and explained its proper application in a Resolution dated June 17, 
2008. The Court set the following guidelines:




 In case a decision is rendered by the [Board of Governors (BOG)] that

 exonerates the respondent or imposes a sanction less than suspension or
 disbarment, the aggrieved party can file a motion for reconsideration 
within the 15-day period from notice. If the motion is denied, said 
party can file a petition for a review under Rule 45
 of the 
Rules of Court with this Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of 
the resolution resolving the motion. If no motion for reconsideration is
 filed, the decision shall become final and executory and a copy of said
 decision shall be furnished this Court.


 If the 
imposable penalty is suspension from the practice of law or disbarment
, the BOG shall issue a resolution setting forth its findings and recommendations. The 
aggrieved
 party can file a motion for reconsideration of said resolution with the
 BOG within fifteen (15) days from notice. The BOG shall first resolve 
the incident and shall thereafter elevate the assailed resolution with 
the entire case records to this Court for final action.
 If the 
15-day period lapses without any motion for reconsideration having been 
filed, then the BOG shall likewise transmit to this Court the resolution
 with the entire case records for appropriate action. (Emphases 
supplied)




 Nowhere in his petition did Atty. Dalangin attempt to justify his 
immediate filing of the petition for review questioning the IBP 
resolutions that recommended his suspension. It could nonetheless be 
inferred from the circumstances that Atty. Dalangin's chosen course of 
action was to preclude the forfeiture of his right to question the 
dismissal of the administrative cases where he served as complainant, 
given that Section 12(c) provides that where the respondent is 
exonerated,
 (t)he case shall be deemed terminated unless upon a 
petition of the complainant or other interested party filed with Supreme
 Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board's resolution, 
the Supreme Court orders otherwise. 
For this reason, the Court 
refused to make an outright denial of Atty. Dalangin's petition for 
review notwithstanding the fact that it questioned the resolve to 
suspend him from the practice of law. Considering that the petition 
likewise covered the IBP's dismissal of the disbarment cases against 
Atty. Torres and Atty. Andres, the Court, in a Resolution dated June 16,
 2015, directed the filing of comments on the petition.
  
 In any case, it must still be stressed that the filing of the 
petition for review on the issue of Atty. Dalangin's suspension from the
 practice of law was as yet not among his remedies, considering that the
 Court still had to release its final action on the matter.
[46]
 It is the Supreme Court, not the IBP, which has the constitutionally mandated duty to discipline lawyers.
[47]

 The factual findings of the IBP can only be recommendatory. Its 
recommended penalties are also, by their nature, recommendatory.
[48]

 In light of these precepts, the Court will then not refuse a review of 
the IBP's recommendation for Atty. Dalangin's suspension notwithstanding
 the premature filing of the petition. In fact, an examination of the 
IBP resolutions for his suspension is warranted as a matter of course, 
even in the absence of a petition, because it is the Court that has the 
duty to take a final action on any determination of the IBP for a 
lawyer's suspension from the practice of law or disbarment.
 Rule 
139-B of the Rules of Court had in fact been later amended by B.M. No. 
1645 dated October 13, 2015. Section 12 thereof now reads:
  


 Sec. 12. Review and recommendation by the Board of Governors. 






a)


 
Every case heard by an 
investigator shall be reviewed by the IBP Board of Governors upon the 
record and evidence transmitted to it by the Investigator with his 
report. 






b)


 
After its review, the Board, by the 
vote of a majority of its total membership, shall recommend to the 
Supreme Court the dismissal of the complaint or the imposition of 
disciplinary action against the respondent. The Board shall issue a 
resolution setting forth its findings and recommendations, clearly and 
distinctly stating the facts and the reasons on which it is based. The 
resolution shall be issued within a period not exceeding thirty (30) 
days from the next meeting of the Board following the submission of the 
Investigator's report. 






c) 


The Board's resolution, together with 
the entire records and all evidence presented and submitted, shall be 
transmitted to the Supreme Court for final action within ten (10) days 
from issuance of the resolution.






d)


 
Notice of the resolution shall be given to all parties through their counsel, if any.








In 
Vasco-Tamaray v. Daquis
,
[49]

 the Court emphasized that the amendments reiterated the principle that 
only the Court has the power to impose disciplinary action on members of
 the bar. Factual findings and recommendations of the Commission on Bar 
Discipline and the Board of Governors of the IBP are recommendatory, 
subject to review by the Court.
[50]


 As the Court now reviews the IBP's resolve to dismiss the 
complaints against Atty. Torres and Atty. Andres, it then also enters 
its final action on the IBP Board of Governors' recommendation to 
suspend Atty. Dalangin from the practice of law for three years, as the 
IBP cited gross misconduct, violations of the CPR and breach of the 
lawyer's oath as grounds.
 
A.C. No. 10758
 
Gross Immorality

 Among several cited grounds, the IBP's recommendation to suspend Atty. 
Dalangin from the practice of law for three years was on the pretext 
that he publicly and openly maintained a romantic relationship with 
Pascual even when their marriages with their respective spouses 
subsisted. Allegedly, the affair further resulted in the birth of the 
child Julienne, who was believed to be Atty. Dalangin's daughter even 
when he turned down a challenge for a DNA test that could prove the 
child's true filiation.
[51]

 In his report, the Investigative Commissioner specifically referred to 
the following evidence to support his finding of an immoral relationship
 between Atty. Dalangin and Pascual:
  


 2. That Complainant Alvaro who executed an affidavit regarding 
the illicit and immoral relation of [Atty. Dalangin] with [Pascual] for 
the reason that she was formerly [close] to [Pascual] and the latter 
confided to her that she (Pascual) [did] not love her husband anymore 
and the child called [Atty. Dalangin] "Papa attorney" (Affidavit of 
Alvaro as Exh. "F"). 


 3. That Ligaya Agrave[,] a neighbor of [Pascual,] likewise 
executed an affidavit that the child ["Julienne''] is the daughter of 
[Atty. Dalangin and Pascual], that she used to see [Atty. Dalangin] 
taking care of [Julienne] when she was still a baby and when she grew up
 already, [Atty. Dalangin] used to accompany the child in their school 
tour and also her graduation. That the child as she grew older is a 
look[-]alike of [Atty. Dalangin]. (Affidavit of Ligaya Agrave marked as 
Exh. "G"). 


 4. That the illicit affair of [Atty. Dalangin] with his former 
Clerk in the PAO, Talavera, Nueva Ecija was well known in Talavera, in 
the entire judiciary in Talavera, Nueva Ecija and even in the community 
of Sto. Domingo, Nueva [E]cija[.] [(L]etter to the Ombudsman dated Aug. 
18, 2011 of Felicidad Sumatra is marked as Exh. "H"). 


 5. That [Atty. Dalangin] refused when challenged for a DNA test. 


 6. Complainants submitted xxx pictures of [Atty. Dalangin and 
Pascual] together with their daughter [Julienne] taken in far away 
Puerto Prinsesa marked as Ex h. I and I-1.


 7. That [Atty. Dalangin] continued to publicly and openly 
cohabit with a woman who is not his legal wife shows his lack of good 
moral character.
[52]




 Time and again, the Court has indeed regarded extramarital affairs
 of lawyers to offend the sanctity of marriage, the family, and the 
community. Illicit relationships likewise constitute a violation of 
Article XV, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution which states that, 
"[m]arriage, as an inviolable social institution, is the foundation of 
the family and shall be protected by the State."
[53]

 When lawyers are engaged in wrongful relationships that blemish their 
ethics and morality, the usual recourse is for the erring attorney's 
suspension from the practice of law, if not disbarment.
 Upon the 
Court's review, however, it finds no sufficient basis to suspend Atty. 
Dalangin for a supposed illicit affair with Pascual. That an amorous 
relationship actually existed between them was not adequately proved.
 The quantum of proof in administrative cases is substantial evidence. The Court explained in 
Saladaga v. Astorga
:
[54]




 Section 5, in relation to Sections 1 and 2, Rule 133 of the 
Rules of Court states that in administrative cases, such as the ones at 
bar, only substantial evidence is required, not proof beyond reasonable 
doubt as in criminal cases, or preponderance of evidence as in civil 
cases. Substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence which a 
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.
[55]




 In 
Reyes v. Nieva
,
[56]
 the Court reiterated this rule on the quantum of proof in administrative proceedings, as it held:
  


 Based on a survey of cases, the recent ruling on the matter is 
Cabas v. Sususco
, which was promulgated just this June 15, 2016. In the said case, it was pronounced that:




 In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary 
for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of 
relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion. x x x.




 Accordingly, this more recent pronouncement ought to control and
 therefore, quell any further confusion on the proper evidentiary 
threshold to be applied in administrative cases against lawyers.




 The rule is taken in light of other settled principles that apply for a proper disposition of administrative cases. In 
Advincula v. Macabata
,
[57]
 the Court emphasized:
  


 The burden of proof rests on the complainant, and she must 
establish the case against the respondent by clear, convincing and 
satisfactory proof, disclosing a case that is free from doubt as to 
compel the exercise by the Court of its disciplinary power. Thus, the 
adage that 
he who asserts not he who denies, must prove
. x x x.
[58]




 Further, the Court emphasized in
 Cabas v. Sususco
[59]

 the oft-repeated rule that "mere allegation is not evidence and is not 
equivalent to proof. Charges based on mere suspicion and speculation 
likewise cannot be given credence."
[60]


 With careful consideration of the foregoing tenets, the 
Court's perusal of the records reveals an insufficiency of evidence that
 could warrant the recommended suspension from the practice of law.

 To begin with, the two affidavits considered by the IBP as bases for 
its finding of Atty. Dalangin's gross immorality harped only on general 
statements of a supposed personal and public knowledge on the wrongful 
relationship between Atty. Dalangin and Pascual. The circumstances that 
could have led them to their conclusion were scant and unsubstantiated. 
The most concrete proof that they could offer was the birth of Julienne,
 yet even the child's birth certificate, a public document, expressly 
indicated the girl's father to be Pascual's husband, and not Atty. 
Dalangin.
[61]
 Julienne's baptismal certificate
[62]

 also provided such fact, along with a confirmation of Atty. Dalangin's 
defense on his closeness to Julienne for being her godfather.
 It 
would be unfair to Atty. Dalangin, more so for the child whose filiation
 is in a way needlessly dragged into this case, for the Court to affirm 
the assertions in the complaint and the IBP's findings and conclusions 
on the basis of the available evidence. The alleged similarities in the 
physical appearances of Atty. Dalangin and Julienne were but lame and 
dismal validations of the complainants' vehement claim of paternity. 
Even the photographs
[63]
 of 
Atty. Dalangin, Pascual and Julienne in what appeared to be a trip to 
Puerto Princesa, Palawan were insufficient to support a conclusion on 
the unlawful relations. The lone photo where Atty. Dalangin appeared 
with Pascual and Julienne, who were apparently merely waiting for 
boarding in an airport terminal, utterly failed to manifest any romantic
 or filial bond among them. It was also explained through an affidavit
[64]

 executed by spouses Dante Capindian and Timotea Jamito that Atty. 
Dalangin was a principal sponsor, while Pascual's family were guests, in
 their wedding which was held on August 6, 2011 in Puerto Princesa, 
Palawan. Apparently, the photos were taken during the said trip. 
Pascual's husband, Edgardo, was also present for the occasion.
 
The Court, nonetheless, does not find Atty. Dalangin totally absolved of
 fault. While he vehemently denied any romantic relationship with 
Pascual, he admitted demonstrating closeness with the latter's family, 
including her children. It was such display of affection that could have
 sparked in the minds of observers the idea of a wrongful relationship 
and belief that Julienne was a product of the illicit affair. Atty. 
Dalangin should have been more prudent and mindful of his actions and 
the perception that his acts built upon the public, particularly because
 he and Pascual were both married. "As officers of the court, lawyers 
must not only in fact be of good moral character but must also be seen 
to be of good moral character and leading lives in accordance with the 
highest moral standards of the community."
[65]

 As keepers of public faith, lawyers are burdened with a high degree of 
social responsibility and, hence, must handle their personal affairs 
with great caution."
[66]

 The fault, nonetheless, does not warrant Atty. Dalangin's suspension, 
much less disbarment. An admonition should suffice under the 
circumstances. The following pronouncement in
 Advincula v. Macabata
[67]
 is pertinent:
  


 While it is discretionary upon the Court to impose a particular 
sanction that it may deem proper against an erring lawyer, it should 
neither be arbitrary and despotic nor motivated by personal animosity or
 prejudice, but should ever be controlled by the imperative need to 
scrupulously guard the purity and independence of the bar and to exact 
from the lawyer strict compliance with his duties to the court, to his 
client, to his brethren in the profession and to the public.


 x x x Only those acts which cause loss of moral character should
 merit disbarment or suspension, while those acts which neither affect 
nor erode the moral character of the lawyer should only justify a lesser
 sanction unless they are of such nature and to such extent as to 
clearly show the lawyer's unfitness to continue in the practice of law. x
 x x
[68]




 
Gross Misconduct and Malpractice
 Atty. Dalangin was 
also charged, and recommended for suspension from the practice of law, 
for several other acts involving use of misleading evidence in court and
 preparation of affidavits with perjured statements to support cases and
 complaints for disbarment. When he still served as a public attorney, 
he likewise allegedly demanded acceptance fees from indigent clients, 
and appeared in courts beyond his area of jurisdiction. Even these 
charges, however, were not supported by evidence that could warrant 
Atty. Dalangin's suspension. And while there were several other charges 
included in the complaint against Atty. Dalangin, the accusations were 
actually for actions that should be attributed not to him, but to other 
individuals like Pascual.
 Specifically on the claim that Atty. 
Dalangin failed to fully explain to Marzan and Valdez the contents of 
the affidavit that supported a disbarment case against Atty. Torres, the
 Court takes note of the fact that the alleged failure to explain did 
not necessarily equate to the falsity of the claims therein made. It 
refers to the joint affidavit executed by Marzan and Valdez, and which 
was attached to the complaint in CBD Case No. 11-3215, whereby affiants 
merely alleged that they signed the affidavit even when they were not 
fully apprised of its contents.
[69]

 It was not alleged that they were fraudulently lured or tricked by 
Atty. Dalangin into signing the complaint, and that the charges therein 
hurled against Atty. Torres were absolutely false. Thus, the claim that 
Atty. Dalangin knowingly brought a groundless suit against a fellow 
lawyer had no leg to stand on.
 The charge of malpractice for 
Atty. Dalangin's supposed demand for attorney's fees while he still 
worked as a PAO lawyer also remained unsubstantiated by evidence. Such 
serious imputation could not have been adequately established by an 
affidavit that was executed in 2010 by a lone person, Camacho, from whom
 the demand for P8,000.00 was allegedly made in 2001.
[70]

 Similarly, while Atty. Dalangin admitted to have appeared in courts 
beyond his area of jurisdiction as public attorney, he claimed to have 
obtained permission therefor from the Regional Public Attorney, a 
defense which the complainants failed to refute. In the absence of 
contrary evidence, the presumption that the respondent regularly 
performed his duty in accordance with his oath shall prevail,
[71]

 especially as the Court considers it highly improbable for the courts 
where appearances were made to fail to notice such patent irregularity, 
if Atty. Dalangin was indeed not authorized to perform his acts before 
their courts as a public attorney.
 Anent the failure of Atty. 
Dalangin to submit all pages of a certificate of title in Civil Case No.
 336-SD(04)AF pending with the RTC, Branch 88, Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija
 and entitled
 Tamayo v. Philippine National Bank
, it has been explained that the error had been corrected at once during the pre-trial conference.
[72]


 Among the other charges imputed against Atty. Dalangin in A.C.
 No. 10758, the Court only finds fault for his misquote of jurisprudence
 cited in a pleading filed with the RTC, Branch 35, Gapan City for Cad. 
Case No. 1564-05 entitled 
Bangko Luzon v. Diaz
. It was narrated in the complaint in CBD Case No. 11-3215 that:
  


 14. x x x [T]he cited jurisprudence is hereto quoted:


 "If a court of competent jurisdiction annulled the foreclosure 
sale of the property in question, the issuance of a writ of possession 
ceases to be ministerial." 


 15. In the said case of BPI vs. Tampipi, there is nothing 
mentioned about the cessation of the ministerial function of the court 
but instead what is clearly stated in the decision are the following: 


 "Until the foreclosure sale of the property in question is 
annulled by a court of competent jurisdiction, the issuance of a writ of
 possession remains the ministerial duty of the trial court."
[73]




 Atty. Dalangin invoked adherence to the substance and spirit of the cited ruling.
[74]

 As counsel and officer of the court, however, with the corresponding 
duty to aid the courts in the task of ascertaining the truth, Atty. 
Dalangin was remiss in the discharge of his duties under the CPR. Canon 
10, Rule 10.02 thereof provides:
  


 "[a] lawyer shall not knowingly misquote or misrepresent the 
contents of paper, the language or the argument of the opposing counsel,
 or the text of a decision or authority, or knowingly cite as a law a 
provision already rendered inoperative by repeal or amendment, or assert
 as a fact that which has not been proved." 




 The Court, nonetheless, still does not find suspension to be an 
appropriate penalty for the act. While the Court detests Atty. 
Dalangin's failure to properly indicate that the statement was not a 
verbatim reproduction of the cited jurisprudence and, accordingly, calls
 his attention on the matter, it finds the admonition to be adequate.

 A suspension for the lone incident would be too harsh a penalty. It 
appeared that the supposed quotation was Atty. Dalangin's own conclusion
 from the cited jurisprudence. There was no clear indication that the 
statement was intended to mislead the court or commit a falsehood; there
 was no brazen deviation from the principle or doctrine that was 
embodied in the jurisprudence's original text.
 
A.C. No. 10759

 In relation to A.C. No. 10759 on Atty. Dalangin's altercation on 
November 14, 2011 with Alvaro as the latter was waiting for the start of
 a court hearing in the RTC of Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija, the records 
include affidavits executed by witnesses who did not appear to have any 
reason to falsely testify against Atty. Dalangin on the incident. 

 Affiant Josephine Rivera, in particular, who claimed to be also then 
waiting for a scheduled hearing, allegedly saw Atty. Dalangin shout and 
point at Alvaro, as he threatened to file a case against the latter.
[75]

 Two security guards stationed at the trial court, evidently 
disinterested persons who would not have wrongly testified against Atty.
 Dalangin, likewise confirmed that such heated confrontation actually 
transpired. Pertinent portions of the guards' affidavit
[76]
  read:
  


 1. Na noong ika-14 ng Nobyembre, 2011, ganap na ika-8:45 ng 
umaga humigit kumulang, habang nakaupo si [Alvaro] sa "bench", upuang 
mahaba malapit sa aming kinauupuan dito sa pintuan ng Hall of Justice, 
Regional Trial Court, Baloc, Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija at kausap niya 
ang isa niyang kasama, dumating si Atty. Bayani Dalangin at pagkakita 
kay [Alvaro] ay pinagsisigawan ito at maraming sinabi laban kay 
[Alvaro];


 2. Na maraming nakarinig, nakakita at nagulat sa pangyayaring ito;


 x x x x 
[77]




 For the Court, Atty. Dalangin erred in his conduct subject of the 
complaint, especially since his outburst was carried out within the 
court premises and in the presence of several persons who readily 
witnessed his fit of anger. Part of Atty. Dalangin 's duties as a lawyer
 is to maintain the honor that is due the profession. Members of the 
legal profession should commit to the mandates of Canon 7, particularly 
Rule 7.03 thereof, to wit:
  


 CANON 7 - A LAWYER SHALL AT ALL TIMES UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION X X X.


 Rule 7.03 -A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely 
reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public
 or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the 
legal profession. 




 Although Atty. Dalangin, at that instant, could have been stirred 
by his frustration or resentment for the disbarment case filed against 
him by Alvaro, such circumstance could not have absolved him from any 
responsibility for his conduct. At most, this only serves to mitigate 
the penalty that the Court deems appropriate to impose, as it likewise 
considers its finding that Alvaro's allegations in CBD Case No. 11-3215 
on the supposed extra-marital affair of Atty. Dalangin with Pascual were
 indeed not backed by sufficient evidence. The Court finds it 
appropriate to impose upon Atty. Dalangin a 
fine of P5,000.00
, 
with a stern warning that a more severe sanction will be imposed on him 
for any repetition of the same or similar offense in the future.
 
Although the Court has admonished Atty. Dalangin in A.C. No. 10758, it 
finds the imposition of this fine still suitable under the 
circumstances, given that A.C. No. 10759, although resolved jointly with
 A.C. No. 10758, is a distinct administrative case that covers a 
separate complaint that was instituted solely by Alvaro. The severity of
 this offense likewise varies from the other breaches for which the 
Court has determined the admonition to be appropriate.
 
A.C. No. 10760 and A.C. No. 10761

 The Court affirms the decision of the IBP to dismiss the administrative
 complaints filed by Atty. Dalangin against Atty. Torres and Atty. 
Andres.
 In A.C. No. 10760, Atty. Dalangin sought to support his 
complaint by referring to the supposed participation of Atty. Torres and
 Atty. Andres in a violation of the Anti-Wiretapping Act. He asserted 
that the act also violated the lawyer's oath, and breached Canon 1, 
Rules 1.01 and 1.02 of the CPR which reads:
  


 CANON 1 - A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW AND LEGAL PROCESSES.


 Rule 1.01 A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.


 Rule 1.02- A lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed 
at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.




 The alleged violation of the statute is a serious charge that the 
Court cannot take lightly, in view of the breach of the basic and 
constitutional right to privacy of communication that inevitably results
 from the act. In brief, the law prohibits any person "to tap any wire 
or cable, or by using any other device or arrangement, to secretly 
overhear, intercept or record such communication or spoken word by using
 a device commonly known as a dictaphone or dictagraph or detectaphone 
or walkie-talkie or tape recorder x x x."
[78]

 It likewise forbids any person from possessing, replaying or furnishing
 transcriptions of communications that are obtained in violation of the 
law.
 In this case, Atty. Dalangin claimed that Atty. Torres and 
Atty. Andres conspired with Alejo on the wrongful recording of a private
 communication with Pineda, along with the use of the transcript thereof
 to support Alejo's affidavit in CBD Case No. 11-3215. However, Pineda's
 own denial of the truth of the statements in the transcription lends 
doubt as to the allegation of a purported secret recording of an actual 
conversation. While Pineda denied knowledge that her telephone 
conversation with Alejo was recorded by the latter, she still refused to
 acknowledge the veracity of the assertions that she allegedly made as 
contained in the transcript,
[79]

 which then appears to be a rejection of the supposed conversation. 
Given the circumstances, the IBP correctly ruled that Atty. Dalangin 
failed to substantiate the charges in his complaint against Atty. Torres
 and Atty. Andres.
 The same conclusion equally applies in A.C. 
No. 10761. The commission of perjury was imputed upon Atty. Torres, as 
the person who prepared the affidavits of Marzan and Valdez. As 
witnesses in CBD Case No. 11-3215, Marzan and Valdez claimed that Atty. 
Dalangin prepared an affidavit for Atty. Torres' disbarment without 
fully explaining to them the contents thereof. The fact that Atty. 
Torres induced the affiants to make perjured statements, however, was 
not established by clear and convincing proof. Even granting that 
statements of affiants were eventually determined to be inaccurate and 
untruthful, it would be wrong to at once ascribe error or fault upon the
 lawyers who drafted the affidavits, in the absence of clear and 
sufficient proof that they actively participated in the intentional 
commission of a fraud or declaration of fabricated statements.

SEPARATE OPINION  


 PERALTA, 
J
.:  
  


 The 
ponencia
 finds that there is no sufficient basis to 
suspend Atty. Bayani P. Dalangin for supposedly having an illicit affair
 with Julita Pascual, a clerk at the Public Attorney's Office in 
Talavera, Nueva Ecija, where Dalangin previously worked as district 
public attorney. It ratiocinated that the existence of such amorous 
relationship was not adequately proved.
  
 With all due respect, while I agree with the ponencia's 
finding that there is indeed fault and imprudence on the part of 
Dalangin, I believe that a mere reprimand is not sufficient to correct 
his actions, but the more serious penalty of suspension should be 
imposed, as aptly recommended by the IBP.
 Indeed, the quantum of 
proof required in administrative cases is substantial evidence. 
Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence. It means
 such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
 support a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might 
conceivably opine otherwise.
[1]

 Certainly, after a thorough investigation, the IBP found the existence 
of substantial evidence proving the presence of the alleged illicit 
affair. Several witnesses testified that Pascual was having an affair 
with Dalangin and even have a child together named Julienne. Complainant
 Glenda Alvaro testified that Pascual confided to her that she no longer
 loves her husband and Julienne would call Dalangin "Papa Attorney." 
This is well known in the courts and the whole of Talavera and even in 
the community of Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija. Dalangin would be seen 
taking care of Julienne when the latter was still a baby and later, 
would likewise accompany her in school trips and would also attend her 
graduation. Dalangin, Pascual, and Julienne were likewise photographed 
while having a vacation in Puerto Princesa, Palawan. When challenged to 
submit himself for DNA testing, Dalangin refused.
 The 
abovementioned circumstances and findings made by the IBP all support 
the conclusion that Dalangin has maintained an adulterous affair with 
Pascual. And when challenged to submit himself for DNA testing to 
finally disprove all the accusations against him, instead of grabbing 
the opportunity to clean his name once and for all, Dalangin simply 
declined. In fact, he himself admitted demonstrating closeness with 
Pascual's family, including her children. The 
ponencia
 even 
noted that it was such display of affection that could have sparked in 
the minds of observers the idea of a wrongful relationship and belief 
that Julienne was a product of said illicit affair.
  
 There is likewise no motive on the part of the witnesses to 
concoct such a false charge. From all indications, they do not appear to
 have any ill motive to falsely testify against Dalangin. Absent any 
proof of motive to fabricate such a story and impute such a grave 
misconduct, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official
 duty and the findings of the IBP shall prevail.
 Section 41 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court states:
  


 
Section 41. 
Common reputation
. â Common reputation
 existing previous to the controversy, respecting facts of public or 
general interest more than thirty years old, or respecting marriage or 
moral character, may be given in evidence. Monuments and inscriptions in
 public places may be received as evidence of common reputation.
[2]




 Settled is the principle that evidence of one's character or 
reputation must be confined to a time not too remote from the time in 
question.
[3]


 Here, Dalangin's relationship with Pascual and Julienne is well 
known in the courts and the whole of Talavera and even in the community 
of Sto. Domingo, Nueva Ecija.
 The Code of Professional Responsibility provides:
  


 Rule 1.01- A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. 


Canon 7- A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and 
dignity of the legal profession, and support the activities of the 
Integrated Bar. 


Rule 7.03- A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely 
reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor should he, whether in 
public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit 
of the legal profession. 




 Morality in our liberal society today is probably a far cry from 
what it used to be. Notwithstanding this permissiveness, lawyers, as 
keepers of public faith, are burdened with a high degree of social 
responsibility and, hence, must handle their personal affairs with 
greater caution. Indeed, those who have taken the oath to assist in the 
dispensation of justice should be more possessed of the consciousness 
and the will to overcome the weakness of the flesh.
[4]
 It has been repeatedly held that to justify suspension or disbarment, the act complained of must not only be immoral, but 
grossly 
immoral.
 A grossly immoral act is one that is so corrupt as to constitute a 
criminal act, or so unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree
 or committed under such scandalous or revolting circumstances as to 
shock the common sense of decency. It is willful, flagrant, or shameless
 as to show indifference to the opinion of good and respectable members 
of the community.
[5]


 In the instant case, Dalangin's intimate relationship with a 
woman other than his wife showed his moral indifference to the opinion 
of the good and respectable members of the community. It manifested his 
disrespect for the laws on the sanctity of marriage and for his own 
marital vow of fidelity. It showed his utmost moral depravity and low 
regard for the fundamental ethics of his profession. Indeed, he has 
fallen below the moral bar. Such detestable behavior warrants a 
disciplinary sanction. Even if not all forms of extramarital relations 
are punishable under penal law, sexual relations outside of marriage are
 considered disgraceful and immoral as they manifest deliberate 
disregard of the sanctity of marriage and the marital vows protected by 
the Constitution and affirmed by our laws.
[6]


WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
, the Integrated Bar 
of the Philippines' recommendation to suspend Atty. Bayani P. Dalangin 
from the practice of law for three (3) years should be upheld.
