[ G.R. No. 180745, August 30, 2017 ]


ALBERTA DE JOYA IGLESIAS, PETITIONER, VS. THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, GEORGE M. JEREOS, ROBERTO G. GEOTINA, JUAN N. TAN, KRISTINE MORALES, AND ALBERTO LINA, RESPONDENTS.
DECISION




LEONEN, J.:


In observing administrative due process, it is essential that the accused be accorded the right to be informed of the accusations against him or her. Fair play requires that the accused be equipped with the necessary information for the preparation of his or her defense.
This is a Petition for Review
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, praying that the December 22, 2006 Decision
[2]
 and November 21, 2007 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 89585 be nullified and set aside.
[4]
 The Court of Appeals affirmed the Office of the Ombudsman February 7, 2005 Resolution
[5]
 and the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon February 21, 2005 Joint Order
[6]
 in OMB L-C-04-0083-B and OMBÂ­L-A-04-0057-B, dismissing petitioner Alberta de Joya Iglesias (Iglesias) from service.
[7]
 Petitioner prays that judgment be rendered absolving her of any criminal and administrative liability and reinstating her to her former position as Acting District Collector in the Port of San Fernando.
[8]
Petitioner Iglesias was employed as Acting District Collector by the Bureau of Customs on October 1, 2002. She was assigned at the Port of San Fernando, La Union by Commissioner Antonio Bernardo.
[9]
On January 28, 2004, the Department of Finance, through Atty. Leon L. AcuÃ±a (Atty. AcuÃ±a) and Troy Francis C. Pizarro (Pizarro), filed a Complaint-Affidavit
[10]
 against Iglesias before the Office of the Ombudsman.
[11]
 Atty. AcuÃ±a and Pizarro claimed that Iglesias failed to file her Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALNs) prior to the year 2000.
[12]
They also alleged that Iglesias made false entries in her 2000, 2001, and 2002 SALNs with respect to two (2) real properties in Quezon City and Pangasinan. The Quezon City property's tax declarations revealed that Iglesias purchased the property on August 1, 1996 from the spouses Rosario and Elpidio Ablang. Likewise, the Pangasinan property's Transfer Certificate of Title was issued by virtue of a deed of sale showing that she purchased a portion of this property from Marina Lopez de Joya (Marina). However, in her SALNs, Iglesias indicated that these properties were acquired through inheritance.
[13]
Atty. AcuÃ±a and Pizarro also discovered three (3) real properties in Pangasinan under Iglesias' name that were not declared in her SALNs.
[14]
 They further asserted that Iglesias acquired several real and personal properties from 1999 to 2002 amounting to P15,230,000.00, which was disproportionate to her lawful source of income. They contended that the following properties were unlawfully acquired:
[15]
Kind of Property 
Year Purchased 
Acquisition Cost 
ParaÃ±aque
 Residential Property 
1999
[P]3 Million 
Novaliches
 Residential Property
1997
[P]3.5 Million 
Baguio Residential
 Property
1995
[P]2 Million 
Baguio Residential Property 
1994
[P]2 Million 
Dump Trucks 
1991
[P]1.6 Million 
Elf
1991
[P]800,000
Van
1999
[P]680,000
Van
1999
[P]850,000
Car 
2002
[P]800,000
[16]
Finally, Atty. AcuÃ±a and Pizarro averred that Iglesias made false representations when she dechtred in her letter to then President Gloria Macapagat-Arroyo that she was taking up Masters in Customs Administration, instead of Masters in Management.
[17]
 They also alleged that Iglesias falsified her Personal Data Sheet when she antedated its execution.
[18]
They charged Iglesias with the following:
a) 
Making untruthful statements in her SAL[N]s a,nd failing to disclose all of her properties in her SAL[N]s (Article 171(4)
[19]
 of the Revised Penal Code);
b) 
Failing to submit her SAL[N]s as required by Sections (sic) 11 in relation to Section 8
[20]
 of Republic Act No. 6713 and Section 7
[21]
 of Republic Act No. 3019;
c)
 Engaging in acts of dishonesty and misconduct by making false representations about her education to Her Excellency, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and by indicating a false date on her Personal Data Sheet; and
d)
 [A]cquiring, during her incumbency an amount of property and/or money manifestly out of proportion to her salary and to her other lawful income (Section 8,
[22]
 [Republic Act No.] 3019); and
e) 
[C]oncealing unlawfully acquired property (Sections 2 and 12 in relation to Section 1(b)(1-3)
[23]
 of Republic Act No. 1379)[.]
[24]
The administrative case was docketed as OMB-L-A-04-0057-B, while the criminal case was docketed as OMB-L-C-04-0083-B.
[25]
On April 12, 2004, Iglesias filed her Counter-Affidavit with Counter-Â­Complaint
[26]
 in the administrative case. She produced copies of her filed annual SALNs since 1989 and attached them to her Counter-Affidavit.
[27]
Iglesias countered that she did not falsify the mode of acquisition of the Pangasinan and Quezon City properties in her SALNs.
[28]
 Iglesias and her sister, Rosario de Joya-Ablang (Rosario), inherited the Quezon City property from their parents.
[29]
 She "merely bought out her sister's share of their joint inherited property[.]"
[30]
 Regarding the Pangasinan property, Iglesias reasoned that she acquired the property through purchase and donation when her mother, Marina, sold it to her for an amount well below its true value.
[31]
Iglesias explained that she did not declare the three (3) Pangasinan properties because these were classified as public lands and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources had yet to award the properties to her. She contended that she was merely considered an applicant for the grant of the public lands.
[32]
On the alleged illegally acquired properties, Iglesias disclosed that she acquired these properties either by purchase or inheritance. She obtained a loan of P9,000,000.00 from Philippine National Bank to buy out Rosario's share and to purchase the Novaliches and Baguio properties. She also sold a property in Baguio to purchase the ParaÃ±aque property. To pay her obligations, she leased her Quezon City property from July 15, 2000 to January 2004. She acquired another loan of P2,000,000.00 from Philippine National Bank-Dagupan Branch to start her trucking business.
[33]
Iglesias asserted that the foreclosure of the Quezon City property for non-payment of her loan "belies the false accusation . . . that [she] is a corrupt government official[.]"
[34]
Iglesias argued that her educational attainment was correctly stated in her resume. She initially took up a master's degree in Customs Administration but was not able to finish the degree and eventually shifted to Management.
[35]
 Lastly, the false date on her Personal Data Sheet was a typographical error.
[36]
She claimed that the allegations against her were false and baseless and that Atty. AcuÃ±a and Pizarro should be held "criminally liable for malicious prosecution" and "for making untruthful statements under oath in their Complaint-Affidavit."
[37]
Iglesias filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File CounterÂ­Affidavit in the criminal case. However, she was still unable to file her counter-affidavit.
[38]
On April 15, 2004, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon issued an Order
[39]
 in connection with the administrative case, preventively suspending Iglesias for six (6) months while the investigation was onÂ­going.
[40]
On August 27, 2004, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon issued an Order requiring the parties to present their arguments in their respective position papers. Iglesias submitted her position paper on September 20, 2004 reiterating her arguments. The Department of Finance submitted its position paper on October 5, 2004 and disclosed new information regarding the business interest of Iglesias in Golden Grove Realty and Development Corporation. Its position paper also included records of cases filed against lglesias.
[41]
On October 12, 2004, Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer I Robert C. ReÃ±ido (Prosecution Officer ReÃ±ido) of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon issued a Joint Resolution
[42]
 resolving the administrative and criminal cases. Prosecution Officer ReÃ±ido considered Iglesias' Counter-Affidavit in the administrative cae as her counter-affidavit in the criminal case "[f]or purposes of exigency and in the interest of justice and due process."
[43]
Prosecution Officer ReÃ±ido found that Atty. AcuÃ±a and Pizarro did not conduct an intensive investigation before they filed the complaint against Iglesias,
[44]
 who was able to submit authentic copies of her filed SALNs from 1989 to 1999.
[45]
He gave merit to Iglesias' explanation that the Quezon City and Pangasinan properties were part of her inheritance from her parents Since Iglesias inherited a great portion of the Quezon City property from her parent, she did not err in declaring the property as acquired through inheritance.
[46]
 Meanwhile, the Pangasinan property was intended to be donated to Iglesias by her mother. They relied on the credibility of the lawyer who made a deed of sale instead of a deed of donation to facilitate the transaction.
[47]
Prosecution Officer ReÃ±ido held that Iglesias was correct in not declaring the three (3) Pangasinan properties in her SALNs, as she had not yet acquired them,
[48]
 On thalleged illegally acquired properties, he stated that Iglesias "was able to shed light on how she was able to lawfully acquire [these] assets."
[49]
On the allegation that Iglesias falsified her educational attainment, Prosecution Officer ReÃ±ido ruled that Iglesias had sufficiently proven that she shifted to Management upon learning that the Civil Service Commission did not require a specific genre of a master's degree.
[50]
 He also found that the alleged falsification of Iglesias' Personal Data Sheet was a mere typographical error.
[51]
Prosecution Officer ReÃ±ido recommended the dismissal of both cases.
[52]
 Likewise, he recommended that the preventive suspension be lifted upon the Joint Resolution's approval.
[53]
Director Emilio A. Gonzalez III of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon approved the Joint Resolution. However, Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon Victor C. Fernandez recommended its disapproval.
[54]
On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Ombudsman issued a Resolution
[55]
 reviewing the October 12, 2004 Joint Resolution. Ombudsman Simeon V. Marcelo (Ombudsman Marcelo) held that Iglesias failed to justify the substantial increase in her net worth. In just one (1) year, her net worth as declared in her SALN increased from P245,000.00 in 1989 to P1,685,000.00 in 1990.
[56]
Ombudsman Marcelo discovered that Iglesias' cash declaration escalated from P250,000.00 in her 1991 SALN to P1,770,000.00 in her 1992 SALN. She also acquired the Baguio, ParaÃ±aque, and Novaliches properties from 1994 to 2000.
[57]
In examining Iglesias' SALNs, Ombudsman Marcelo found that she obtained housing loans of P14,000,000.00 in 1994, P26,000,000.00 in 1998, and P29,000,000.00 in 1999.
[58]
 Since the housing loans were not supported by evidence, Ombudsman Marcelo considered them "spurious or non-existent, meant only to cover up the rapidly increasing assets of [Iglesias]."
[59]
According to Ombudsman Marcelo, Iglesias also falsified her Personal Data Sheet "when she denied having any criminal charges ever filed against her . . . despite evidence to the contrary."
[60]
 Iglesias had two (2) pending estafa cases and three (3) dismissed cases before the lower courts, as stated in the National Bureau of Investigation's May 22, 2001 Certification.
[61]
 She likewise committed falsification when she did not declare the true value of the Pampanga property and reported its worth at only P50,000.00.
[62]
As for Iglesias' allegation of leasing her Quezon City property and starting a trucking business, Ombudsman Marcelo stated that there was np evidence presented to support her claims. She also failed to declare the alleged trucking business in her SALN.
[63]
Ombudsman Marcelo held that the acts of Iglesias constitute dishonesty and grave misconduct, punishable by dismissal from service under Rule IV, Section 52(A) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, in relation to Book V, Sections 9 and 22 of the Administrative Code of 1987.
[64]
The dispositive portion of the Resolution read:
WHEREFORE
, the 12 October 2004 Joint Resolution is DISAPPROVED. Respondent ALBERTA DE JOYA-IGLESIAS is hereby found guilty of the administrative offense of DISHONESTY and GRAVE MISCONDUCT. Thus, she is ordered DISMISSED from the service, with cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and disqualification for reemployment in the government service.
Moreover, sufficient probable cause exists to hold respondent ALBERTA DE JOYA IGLESIAS liable for violation of Art. 171 (Falsification) and Art. 183 (Perjury) of the Revised Penal Code. Let the Informations charging her with the said offenses be forthwith filed against her before the appropriate court.
Additionally, let a Petition for Forfeiture of Unlawfully Acquired Properties be filed before the proper court against respondent in view of the herein found accumulation of unexplained wealth.
The Field Investigation Office (FIO) is hereby ordered to investigate the matter regarding the false valuation made on the Deed of Sale covering the Pampanga property transferred in favor of respondent and secure the necessary documentary evidence for the purpose of filing a criminal complaint for Falsification against her.
SO ORDERED.
[65]
 (Emphasis in the original)
Iglesias moved for reconsideration,
[66]
 which was denied by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon in its February 21, 2005 Joint Order.
[67]
Iglesias appealed the February 7, 2005 Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman and the February 21, 2005 Joint Order of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon before the Court of Appeals.
[68]
Iglesias argued that she was denied administrative due process. She claimed that there was failure to meet the substantial evidence requirement in administrative proceedings.
[69]
 Further, she asserted that her defense of denial and the presence of mitigating circumstances should have been considered by the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.
[70]
In its December 22, 2006 Decision,
[71]
 the Court of Appeals affirmed the assailed February 7, 2005 Resolution and February 21, 2005 Joint Order.
[72]
 It held that there was no denial of due process since Iglesias was able to explain her side in her Counter-Affidavit and her Motion for Reconsideration of the February 7, 2005 Resolution.
[73]
The Court of Appeals declared that the assailed Resolution and Joint Order rest on substantial evidence; hence, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon did not commit any grave abuse of discretion.
[74]
 It added that Iglesias' defense of denial and the alleged mitigating circumstances were bereft of merit.
[75]
Iglesias moved for reconsideration, which was denied
[76]
 by the Court of Appeals in its November 21, 2007 Resolution.
[77]
Hence, on January 17, 2008, Iglesias filed this Petition for Review
[78]
 with an application for temporary restraining order against the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Finance officers, namely, Commissioner George M. Jereos (Commissioner Jereos), Deputy Commissioner Roberto G. Geotina (Deputy Commissioner Geotina), Acting Collector Juan T. Tan (Tan), Acting Disbursement Officer Kristine Morales (Morales), and Commissioner Alberto Lina (Commissioner Lina) (collectively, respondents).
Petitioner alleges that respondent Tan took her place as Acting District Collector during her preventive suspension. However, after the termination of her six (6)-month suspension, she was not automatically reinstated to her position and respondent Tan was confirmed as Acting District Collector. Petitioner claims that she was demoted as Deputy Collector for Operations without due process.
[79]
Petitioner asserts that respondents Commissioner Jereos and Deputy Commissioner Geotina immediately implemented the dismissal order while her motion for reconsideration of the February 7, 2005 Resolution was still pending before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon. Thus, respondent Morales immediately withheld her salary and other benefits.
[80]
 Respondent Commissioner Lina was included as a nominal party-respondent.
[81]
Petitioner prays that the December 22, 2006 Decision and November 21, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals be nullified and set aside. Petitioner likewise prays that judgment be rendered absolving her of any criminal and administrative liability and reinstating her to her former position as Acting District Collector at the Port of San Fernando.
[82]
Petitioner raises the following issues:
I.
WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISMISSING THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI
II.
WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITIONER WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW
III.
WHETHER PETITIONER WAS DENIED OF HER RIGHT TO BE INFORMED OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HER
[83]
Petitioner argues that she was not given an opportunity to refute the new accusations and charges against her which were not stated in the Complaint-Affidavit. Her filing of a Motion for Reconsideration did "not address the fact that she was never informed of the true allegations against her."
[84]
 Thus, she claims that "her right to be informed of the accusations against her and to be afforded with due process of law has been violated."
[85]
On April 25, 2000, respondents officers of the Department of Finance, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed their Comment
[86]
 and prayed for the denial of the Petition.
[87]
 They assert that petitioner was properly informed of the charges against her.
[88]
 Moreover, her right to due process was not violated since she was given enough opportunity to counter the allegations:
In this case, 
petitioner was able to file her Counter-Affidavit dated April 6, 2004 in OMB-L-A-04-0057-B
. 
She was likewise given the opportunity to file her counter-affidavit in OMB-L-C-04-0083-B but she failed to do so despite her having filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Counter-Affidavit dated March 19, 2004.
 Based on the Comment dated September 21, 2005 of the Office of the Ombudsman, the petitioner even filed a Motion for Early Resolution and Lifting of Preventive Suspension, and a Position Paper. Moreover, she likewise filed her Motion for Reconsideration dated February 14, 2005.
Clearly, petitioner was given opportunity to explain her side and she moved for reconsideration of the challenged Resolution dated February 7, 2005. She was never denied her right to due process.
[89]
 (Emphasis in the original)
On May 5, 2008, respondent Office of the Ombudsman filed its Comment
[90]
 and likewise prayed for the denial of the Petition. It argues that the Court of Appeals was correct in ruling "that petitioner was afforded due process by the Office of the Ombudsman and [that] the questioned resolutions were supported by substantial evidence and based on the records and evidence at hand."
[91]
The Office of the Ombudsman counters that petitioner was not denied due process since "petitioner had the opportunity to present her side, submit countervailing evidence to refute the Department of Finance's claims and even move for a reconsideration of the decision."
[92]
 Further, it asserts that "petitioner was sufficiently informed of the charges against her as shown in her Counter-Affidavit, Motion for Early Resolution and Lifting of Preventive Suspension, Position Paper and the assailed Resolutions of the Office of the Ombudsman."
[93]
On May 14, 2008, petitioner filed her Reply and reiterated that she was denied due process since she was not informed of the offenses charged against her.
[94]
On July 8, 2009, this Court issued a Resolution
[95]
 requiring the parties to submit their respective memoranda. Petitioner filed her Memorandum
[96]
 on September 18, 2009, while respondent Office of the Ombudsman filed its Memorandum
[97]
 on October 1, 2009. Both parties reiterated their arguments in their earlier pleadings. Respondents officers of the Department of Finance failed to file their memorandum.
On September 30, 2010, petitioner also filed a Supplement to the Supplemental Memorandum.
[98]
On October 17, 2011, petitioner again filed a Supplemental Memorandum.
[99]
 She stated that Branch 45, Metropolitan Trial Court of Pasay City issued a Joint Decision
[100]
 acquitting her of three (3) counts of perjury in Criminal Case Nos. 05-1160, 05-1161, and 05-1162.
[101]
 The perjury cases alleged that petitioner made untruthful statements in connection with three (3) real properties on her December 31, 2000 SALN.
[102]
 Petitioner contends that since she was able to counter the anomalies in her statements, she "should only be held liable for simple neglect of duty."
[103]
On January 21, 2015, petitioner filed her last Supplemental Memorandum.
[104]
 Petitioner informed this Court that the other falsification and perjury cases related to the present case were dismissed by the trial courts, particularly:
Criminal Case No. Q-05-137 (pending before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 77) - dismissed on 30 January 2008;
Criminal Cases (sic) Nos. 05-1160 to 1162 (For Perjury, pending before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 45) - acquitting the accused on 21 June 2011[;]
Criminal Case Nos. (sic) 421447-62-CR (For Perjury, pending before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 1) - acquitting the accused on 30 April 2014[;]
Criminal Case No. 05-238700 (For Falsification of Public Document, pending before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 30) Â­ acquitting the accused on 23 July 2014[;] [and]
Criminal Case Nos. 40970 to 72 (For Perjury, pending before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities of San Fernando City, La Union) - acquitting the accused on 17 October 2014.
[105]
This Court resolves the main issue of whether or not petitioner was denied of administrative due process when the Resolution dismissing her appeal was based on allegations that were not contained in the Complaint. Resolving this main issue will pass on the issues of whether or not petitioner was denied of her right to be informed of the charges against her and whether or not petitioner was denied of her right to due process. Since these issues are interrelated, they will be addressed jointly.
Petitioner's contention has no merit.
Administrative due process demands that the party being charged is given an opportunity to be heard.
[106]
 Due process is complied with "if the party who is properly notified of allegations against him or her is given an opportunity to defend himself or herself against those allegations, and such defense was considered by the tribunal in arriving at its own independent conclusions."
[107]
In 
F/O Ledesma v. Court of Appeals
:
[108]
Due process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to explain or defend himself. In administrative proceedings, the filing of charges and giving reasonable opportunity for the person so charged to answer the accusations against him constitute the minimum requirements of due process. The essence of due process is simply to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side, or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.
[109]
An important component of due process is the right of the accused to be informed of the nature of the charges against him or her.
[110]
 A proper appraisal of the accusations would give the accused an opportunity to adequately prepare for his or her defense. Otherwise, substantial justice would be undermined.
[111]
In this case, petitioner insists that the February 7, 2005 Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman was based on new accusations that were not included in the Complaint Affidavit filed by Atty. AcuÃ±a and Pizarro. She anchors her argument on the findings of the Ombudsman:
"In her 
first year
 in the government service, respondent reported a net worth of P245,000.00 in her 1989 SALN, which swiftly grew to P1,685,000.00 during her 
second year (1990 SALN)
. The additional P1,440,000.00 accumulated by respondent is a 60% jump from her 
1989 net worth
. During that same period, respondent was able to purchase a property in Paco, Manila, in the amount of P800,000.00, acquired additional jewelry worth P250,000.00, and maintained cash in the bank in the amount of P400,000.00. This sudden upsurge in respondent's net worth, within the short period of one (1) year, is unjustified considering that she had no other employment, business activity or financial interests from which the acquisitions can be funded other than her employment in the Bureau of Customs.
"Respondent's 
1991 and 1992 SALN
 likewise reflected the meteoric rise of her assets. From the declared cash of P250,000.00 in 1991, the same soared high to the amount of P1,770,000.00 which was not sufficiently justified or explained by her income from the government, or her reported total new loans of P610,000.00, consisting of jewelry loan in the amount of P110,000.00 and an agricultural loan in the amount of P500,000.00.
"Apart from the properties in New Manila, Quezon City, and Pampanga which respondent justified as to have been inherited by her from her parents, respondent is likewise the owner of several properties located in Baguio City, ParaÃ±aque City, and Novaliches, Quezon City, which she acquired beginning 
1994 to 2000
."
[112]
 (Emphasis in the original)
Considering the above, this Court finds that there was a violation of due process with respect to the other charges which were 
not in the original complaint
. This Court sternly reminds the Ombudsman that he cannot add new findings which were not part of the original complaint. To do so would violate the right of the accused to due process.
However, there were charges in the 
original complaint
 which should prosper. A reading of the Office of the Ombudsman Resolution reveals that she was dismissed from service not solely on the irregularities found in her 1989 to 1999 SALNs but also because of anomalies found in her 2000 to 2002 SALNs, which she was informed of and was given the opportunity to refute. Petitioner conveniently left out in her pleadings the following findings of the Office of the Ombudsman:
It should be noted, however, that respondent has two (2) Baguio properties indicated in her 2000-2002 SALNs. The first Baguio property was acquired in 1995, thus, its declaration in her 1996 SALN. From 1996-1999, she had been maintaining that same property. However, as evidenced by her 2000 SALN, she acquired another property in Baguio. Presuming that, as claimed by respondent, the PNB loan paid for the acquisition of the first Baguio property, with what funds did she acquire the second Baguio property?
Moreover, on the same year, respondent also acquired the Para[Ã±]aque property. 
Although respondent claims that she sold one of the Baguio properties to buy the Para[Ã±]aque property, she continued to declare the Baguio properties as her own in her SALN for 2000-2002
. This, therefore, would belie any assertion of sale . . .
Incidentally, it should be noted that during the years 2000-2002, respondent was no longer declaring any cash in bank as part of her assets.
 She did not declare the proceeds received from the sale of the Baguio property to Mario Nicolas despite her admission that she was given the initial payment of P1,100,000.00. Granted that she used P1,000,000.00 thereof to make the [down payment] on the Para[Ã±]aque property, this would still leave her with P100,000.00 cash in hand, not to forget the balance of P1,100,000.00 still owing her, which should have been declared as part of her assets.
As for the monthly amortization for the Para[Ã±]aque property that had to be paid to BPI, the claim that the rentals on the New Manila property answered for it does not seem to hold water. 
First, respondent claims that in view of the fact that she has defaulted on the payments on the PNB loan, the PNB has since foreclosed the property. The inscription at the back of the title states that the property was foreclosed in 1999. This, thus, precludes respondent from having the place rented. Second, assuming that the said foreclosure is being contested and is now the subject of pending litigation, it is a puzzle how the lease was effected and why it was made for a lengthy period of time. Third, respondent did not specify how much the lease rental was and if it were sufficient to pay for the monthly mortgage owing BPI, and, most importantly, respondent failed to present evidence to substantiate the claim of lease by JIM-Mar Enterprises.
. . . .
As for the trucks and vans, respondent justifies that the same were acquired by virtue of a loan from PNB-Dagupan Branch in the amount of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00). She claims that the same loan was used to buy the dump trucks, van, and other equipment, and as operating capital for her trucking business. 
Respondent, however, failed to present evidence regarding the said loan and the security used to obtain it. She also did not present any evidence regarding the trucking business. Also, she did not disclose this in her SALN as one of her business interests.
Further, respondent admitted to committing another act of falsific:ation. 
In explaining the classification of the Pampanga property as an inheritance/donation inter vivos, respondent admitted that she misdeclared the true value of the said land as merely P50,000.00 in the Deed of Sale conveying the said property in her favor.
 This scheme was obviously resorted to in order to evade the payment of higher taxes.
[113]
 (Emph[lsis supplied)
Even if the findings in relation to petitioner's 1989 to 1999 SALNs were disregarded, petitioner would still be liable for the discrepancies in her 2000 to 2002 SALNs. These discrepancies were stated in the Complaint Affidavit and were given clarification by petitioner in her Counter-Affidavit and Position Paper. Moreover, she was able to move for reconsideration of the Office of the Ombudsman February 7, 2005 Resolution. These circumstances preclude petitioner from claiming that she was denied her right to due process.
On a final note, this Court endeavors to strike a balance between the accountability of public officers as a result of public office being a privilege, on the one hand, and their right to privacy as protected in the Bill of Rights, on the other. Although this Court has held that the requirement of submitting a SALN does not violate the right to privacy of public officers,
[114]
 it does not mean that they should completely shed this right. Therefore, minor or explainable errors in the SALN, which cannot be related to an attempt to conceal illicit activities should not be punishable. This Court may relax the rule on strictly complying with the SALN in cases where minor errors were committed since these may simply be used to harass and obstruct public officers in the performance of their duties. However, the errors in this case were so substantial and glaring that they should not escape prosecution.
WHEREFORE
, the Decision dated December 22, 2006 and the Resolution dated November 21, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 89585 are 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION

GUILTY
 of 
DISHONESTY

GRAVE MISCONDUCT

DISMISSED

This is without prejudice to other administrative and criminal charges that may be filed against her.
