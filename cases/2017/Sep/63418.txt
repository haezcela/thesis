RE: REQUESTS FOR SURVIVORSHIP PENSION BENEFITS OF SPOUSES OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES WHO DIED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVITY OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9946


RESOLUTION




MARTIRES, J.:




For resolution are the applications for 
survivorship benefits of spouses of justices and judges who died prior 
to the effectivity
[1]
 of Republic Act 
(R.A.)
 No. 9946, which introduced substantial amendments to the benefits provided in R.A. No. 910. 
 In a Memorandum, dated 11 July 2017, the Special Committee on Retirement and Civil Service Benefits (
SC-RCSB
)
 submitted for this Court's consideration the respective positions of 
the members of the Committee on the matter regarding the survivorship 
pension benefits. The first position paper, labeled as Memorandum A, 
dated 23 June 2017, recommends the approval of the applications; 
whereas, the second position paper, labeled as Memorandum B, dated 6 
July 2017, recommends their denial. Memorandum B adopted the position 
and arguments of the SC-RCSB Technical Working Group (TWG) contained in 
the latter's Memorandum, dated 24 February 2017. 

We now determine whether the applicants are entitled to the 
survivorship pension benefits and automatic pension adjustment under 
R.A. No. 9946. 

Background


 Enacted in 1954, R.A. No. 910 is the law on retirement benefits 
for the justices of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. It 
provides for two kinds of benefits: 
(1) 
retirement 
and
 (2)
 death benefits
.
[2]


 The retirement benefits granted under R.A. No. 910 may be
 compulsory 
or 
optional
,
 subject to certain age and length of service requirements. For 
compulsory retirement, a justice must have reached the age of 70 years 
and must have rendered service in the Judiciary or any other government 
branch for at least 20 years; for optional retirement, 57 years of age 
and 20 years in government service, the last 10 of which must be 
continuously rendered in the Judiciary. Compulsory retirement also 
applies when the justice, regardless of age, is forced to resign by 
reason of incapacity to discharge the duties of the office. 
 The 
death benefits, on the other hand, are given to the heirs of the justice
 who dies while in actual service. The benefits are equivalent to a 
five-year lump sum of the salary the justice was receiving during the 
period of death, provided the justice had reached the minimum 20 years 
of government service; and only two-year lump sum of the salary, if 
service rendered was less than 20 years. The same benefits are granted 
as to justices who have not attained the 20-year service requirement but
 are compulsorily retired upon reaching the age of 70 years, or were 
forced to retire due to illness or other causes beyond their control.
 Under R.A. No. 910, the retirement benefits were granted the justice; the death benefits to the
 heirs
. 
No benefits were granted to the surviving legitimate spouse of the 
retired
 justice
 except for the death benefit which is paid to the surviving spouse as a rightful heir.

 Subsequent legislations expanded the coverage of R.A. No. 910 to 
include justices or judges of other courts, such as the Sandiganbayan, 
the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), the Regional Trial Court (RTC), the 
Metropolitan Trial Court, the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), the Municipal
 Circuit Trial Court, the Shari'a District Court, the Shari'a Circuit 
Court, and any other court.
[3]

 The qualifications for entitlement to the benefits were likewise 
amended. Thus, in 1959, R.A. No. 2614 adjusted the minimum age for 
optional retirement of justices and judges to 65 years.
 The 
enactment of R.A. No. 9946 in 2010 introduced more changes to R.A. No. 
910, more importantly the amendments to benefits granted to the 
surviving spouses of justices and judges: (1) Retirement Benefits; (2) 
Death Benefits; (3) Lump Sum Retirement Benefits; (4) Survivorship 
Pension Benefits; and (5) Automatic Pension Adjustment. The following

 			 		 	 				 			  	The benefits granted to the surviving legitimate
 spouses of justices and judges are encapsulated in paragraph 2, Section
 3, of R.A. No. 910, as amended by R.A. No. 9946, viz:



 Upon the death of a Justice or Judge of any court in the 
Judiciary, if such Justice or Judge had retired, or was eligible to 
retire optionally at the time of death, the surviving legitimate spouse 
shall be entitled to receive all the retirement benefits that the 
deceased Justice or Judge would have received had the Justice or Judge 
not died. The surviving spouse shall continue to receive such retirement
 benefits until the surviving spouse's death or remarriage. 




Also inserted in the new law are Sections 3-A and 3-B which provide: 




Sec. 3-A. All pension benefits of retired members of the 
Judiciary shall be automatically increased whenever there is an increase
 in the salary of the same position from which he/she retired. 


Sec. 3-B. The benefits under this Act shall be granted to all those who have retired prior to the effectivity of this Act: 
Provided
, that the benefits shall be applicable only to members of the Judiciary: 
Provided, further
, That the benefits to be granted shall be prospective. 




On 6 September 2010, the Court issued Revised Administrative Circular No. 81-2010 (
RAC 81-2010
), or the Guidelines on the Implementation of R.A. No. 9946, which provide, among others:




 
E.	Survivorship Pension Benefits


 The legitimate surviving spouse of a Justice or Judge who (1) has 
retired or was eligible to retire optionally at the time of death, and 
(2) was receiving or would have been entitled to receive a monthly 
pension, shall be entitled to receive the said benefits that the 
deceased Justice or Judge would have received had the Justice or Judge 
not died. The surviving spouse shall continue to receive such retirement
 benefits until the surviving spouse's death or remarriage. 


F.	Other Entitlements




	All pension benefits of retired members of the Judiciary shall 
be automatically increased whenever there is an increase in the salary 
of the same position from which he/she retired.
The benefits under R.A. No. 9946 shall be granted to all those 
who have retired prior to its effectivity, provided that the benefits 
shall be applicable only to members of the Judiciary and the benefits to
 be granted shall be prospective, beginning February 11, 2010, the date 
of effectivity of R.A. No. 9946. 
The implementing guidelines provided herein shall be applicable 
to officials of the Judiciary who have been granted the rank, salary and
 privileges of a member of the Judiciary subject to the conditions set 
forth in the resolutions, dated December 9, 2008, and February 17, 2009,
 in A.M. No. 11838-Ret.


 
PROHIBITIONS TO ENTITLEMENT TO PENSION




	A retired Justice of the SC, CA, SB, CTA or a Judge of the RTC, 
MeTC, MTCC, MTC, MCTC, SDC, SCC or his/her surviving spouse receiving 
the benefits of R.A. No. 9946 during the time that he/she is receiving 
said pension shall not appear as counsel before any court in any civil 
case wherein the government or any subdivision or instrumentality 
thereof is the adverse party, or in any criminal case wherein an 
incumbent or former office or employee of the government is accused of 
an offense committed in relation to his/her office, or collect any fee 
for his/her appearance in any administrative proceedings to maintain an 
interest to the Government, National, Provincial or municipal, or to any
 of its legally constituted offices. 
The member of the Judiciary or his/her surviving spouse who 
assumes an elective public office shall not, upon assumption of office 
and during his/her term, receive the monthly pension due to him/her. 
 The surviving spouse who remarries shall no longer be entitled to the survivorship benefit. 


Related Cases


Since the passage of R.A. No. 9946, a great number of 
applications for survivorship benefits had been filed by surviving 
spouses of justices and judges, presumably on account of the 
retroactivity provision in Section 3-B thereof. The Court had approved 
many of such applications. As reported by the TWG, there are now 307 
spouses of justices and judges who had died prior to the effectivity of 
R.A. No. 9946 and who are receiving pension benefits. There are also 29 
pending requests with the TWG, and more than 100 applications more 
before the Office of the Court Administrator waiting clarification of 
deemed inconsistent grants of survivorship benefits.

 The apparently inconsistent rulings of the Court refer to the cases of Deputy Court Administrator Nimfa Vilches (
Vilches
),
[5]
 CTA Judge Manuel Gruba (
Gruba
),
[6]
 and MTC Judge Galo Alvor, Jr. (
Alvor
)
[7]
 In 
Vilches
 and 
Gruba
, the Court granted 10-year lump sum gratuities under Section 2 in favor of the surviving spouses of Vilches and Gruba but 
denied the claim for survivorship pension benefits

 for the reason that the latter were not eligible to retire and, thus, 
not entitled to the benefits under Section 3. However, in 
Alvor
, the Court 
granted
 Mrs. Alvor
 pro rata survivorship pension benefits

 even though Judge Alvor was not eligible to retire at the time of his 
death. The following table presented by the TWG shows the comparative 
data of the three cases:

Court Actions 


Heirs were granted only the 10-year lump sum gratuity under Section 2 of RA 910, as amended by RA 9946
      
 No survivorship pension benefits were granted 
to the surviving widower, as DCA Vilches was not eligible to retire and 
was thus not entitled to the benefits under Section 3.


In 1996, the heirs were granted the 5-year lump sum gratuity under Section 2 of RA 910, prior to RA 9946.
      
 In January 2012, Mrs. Gruba was initially 
granted full survivorship pension benefits, applying the reduced 15 
years service requirement under R.A. No. 9946.


 In November 2013, the Court revoked the grant 
of survivorship pension benefits to Mrs. Gruba. Judge Gruba was found 
ineligible to retire at the time of his death, for reason of age. 


Instead, the heirs were granted the increased 10-year lump sum gratuity under Section 2 of RA 9946.


In 1991, the heirs were granted the 5-year lump sum gratuity under Section 2 of RA 910, prior to RA 9946. 
      
In October 2013, Mrs. Alvor was granted 
pro-rata survivorship pension benefits, extending further the liberal 
application of R.A. No. 9946. 






In view of the Court's varying rulings on the grant of survivorship 
benefits in the three cases, the Office of the Court Administrator 
(OCA), through its Memorandum
[8]
 dated 26 October 2015, recommended a revisit of RAC 81-2010 to adopt 
Alvor
.
[9]


 It is also noted that in the approved applications for 
survivorship pension benefits, the amounts are exclusive of adjustments 
of pension benefits by virtue of the 1st and 2nd tranche salary 
increases under Executive Order
 (E.O.) 
No. 201, series of 2016, effective 1 January 2016. 

The Issues


 In resolving this matter, the Court takes note of the issues presented by the TWG in their Memorandum, to wit:

 Who are the surviving spouses entitled to the benefits under Section 3, paragraph 2;
What are the benefits that a qualified surviving spouse is entitled to receive; 
 Are qualified surviving spouses entitled to the automatic increase under Section 3-A;
 Does Section 3-B, in providing for the retroactive application of
 R.A. No. 9946, entitle the surviving spouses of justices or judges who 
died prior to the effectivity of said Act to the same benefits as those 
of justices or judges who died on or after the effectivity of R.A. No. 
9946 on 11 February 2010.
[10]


 
OUR RULING
 We rule that the surviving 
spouses of justices and judges who died prior to the effectivity of R.A.
 No. 9946 are entitled to survivorship benefits.
 We stress that 
this will not be the first time that the Court has been asked to 
interpret the provisions contained in R.A. No. 9946. The Court had the 
occasion to extensively pass upon the meaning of the words and phrases 
found in the text of the law in the case of 
Re: Application for 
Survivorship Pension Benefits under Republic Act No. 9946 of Mrs. Pacita
 A. Gruba, Surviving Spouse of the Late Manuel K. Gruba, Former CTA 
Associate Judge Gruba
[11]
 
(Gruba case)
 promulgated on 19 November 2013.
 In 
Gruba
,
 Manuel Gruba died on 25 June 1996 while he was a judge of the CTA. He 
was 55 years old and had rendered government service for about 16 years,
 the last 3 years and 9 months of which were served in the Judiciary. 
His heirs were paid a five-year lump sum gratuity. After the effectivity
 of R.A. No. 9946, Mrs. Gruba applied for survivorship pension benefits 
which the Court initially approved but later on revoked.

 On the issue whether R.A. No. 9946 applies to the heirs of Judge
 Gruba being entitled to the increased 10-year lump sum gratuity 
benefits, the Court answered in the affirmative. But on whether Mrs. 
Gruba is entitled to receive survivorship pension benefits, the Court 
ruled to deny her such because Judge Gruba was not eligible to retire 
optionally (lack in age requirement) at the time of his death.

 The Court is mindful that R.A. No. 9946 is a retirement law and a
 social legislation enacted under the policy of the State to promote 
social justice,
[12]
 thus, its interpretation must be liberal in keeping with its purposes. As the Court explained in
 Gruba
, retirement laws are liberally construed in order to achieve the humanitarian purposes of the law, thus -



 Retirement laws, in particular, are liberally construed in favor 
of the retiree because their objective is to provide for the retiree's 
sustenance and, hopefully, even comfort, when he no longer has the 
capability to earn a livelihood. The liberal approach aims to achieve 
the humanitarian purposes of the law in order that efficiency, security,
 and well-being of government employees may be enhanced. Indeed, 
retirement laws are liberally construed and administered in favor of the
 persons intended to be benefited, and all doubts are resolved in favor 
of the retiree to achieve their humanitarian purpose.
[13]








R.A. No. 9946 covers justices and judges who died prior to its effectivity.
 






Beginning 11 February 2010, or upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 9946,
 the benefits under the old law had been upgraded while at the same time
 the age and length of service requirements were reduced. Likewise, pro 
rata monthly pension benefit was introduced for the first time in favor 
of justices or judges with less than 15 years of government service who 
retire due to age or incapacity to discharge his or her duties. More 
importantly, the new law provided for survivorship benefits in favor of 
the surviving spouses of justices and judges who were "retired" or 
eligible for optional retirement and died after the effectivity of R.A. 
No. 9946.

 By virtue of the retroactivity clause in Section 3-B, the 
"benefits" under R.A. No. 9946 are made to apply to justices and judges 
who died
 prior 
to the effectivity of R.A. No. 9946. 

 The TWG suggests that "the benefits of R.A. No. 9946 are available retroactively, only to those who retired prior to 
and are still alive upon

 its effectivity and not necessarily to those who [had] retired and died
 prior thereto or to those who had not retired but died prior to R.A. 
No. 9946." The TWG is incorrect. 

 Even in 
Gruba
, the Court recognized the entitlement to 
survivorship benefits of surviving spouses of justices and judges who 
died prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 9946. There was no express 
mention that the coverage of the law includes only those who have 
retired prior to and are still alive upon its effectivity. Thus, the 
Court held that Judge Gruba, who passed away prior to the effectivity of
 R.A. No. 9946, is still covered by the law by virtue of Section 3-B. 
The Court then went on to state that Mrs. Gruba would have been entitled
 to the claimed survivorship benefits had Judge Gruba complied with the 
minimum age requirement to become eligible for retirement at the time of
 his death. Citing established jurisprudence, the Court ratiocinated: 



Providing retroactivity to judges and justices who died while in 
service conforms with the doctrine that retirement laws should be 
liberally construed and administered in favor of persons intended to be 
benefited." [T]he liberal approach aims to achieve the humanitarian 
purposes of the law in order that the efficiency, security, and 
well-being of government employees may be enhanced. Ensuring the welfare
 of families dependent on government employees is achieved in the 
changes made in Republic Act No. 9946. It will be consistent with the 
humanitarian purposes of the law if the law is made retroactive to 
benefit the heirs of judges and justices who passed away prior to the 
effectivity of Republic Act No. 9946.
[14]




 Thus, there is no question that the benefits under R.A. No. 9946 
extend to those who had died before 11 February 2010. This would include
 the survivorship benefits in favor of surviving spouses of such 
deceased justices and judges. The Court sees no compelling reason at 
this point to revisit this ruling. 





Who are the "surviving spouses" referred to under Section 3, paragraph 2?






We restate Section 3, paragraph 2, of R.A. No. 9946: 



Upon the death of a Justice or Judge of any court in the Judiciary, if such Justice or Judge has 
retired
, or was 
eligible to retire optionally

 at the time of death, the surviving legitimate spouse shall be entitled
 to receive all the retirement benefits that the deceased Justice or 
Judge would have received had the Justice or Judge not died. The 
surviving spouse shall continue to receive such retirement benefits 
until the surviving spouse's death or remarriage, (emphasis supplied)
  




 It is clear that the benefits of the law, effective 11 February 
2010, are granted to a surviving legitimate spouse of a justice or judge
 who:

	had retired; or 
was eligible to retire optionally at the time of death.


 The Guidelines (RAC 81-2010) also describes the beneficiaries of the
 law to be the surviving legitimate spouse of a justice or judge who:

	had retired and was receiving a monthly pension; or 
 was eligible to retire optionally at the time of death and would have been entitled to receive a monthly pension.


 The TWG, thus, posits that the surviving spouse of a justice or 
judge, who had not retired but died while in actual service, is not 
eligible to receive the survivorship benefit (monthly pension) under 
Section 3 of R.A. No. 9946, unless said justice or judge was eligible to
 retire optionally at the time of death. The TWG, however, notes that 
the surviving spouse is entitled to the death benefit under Section 2, 
along with the other heirs of the deceased justice or judge.
 It is imperative, at this juncture, to clarify the meaning of the term "
retired
" as appearing in Section 3, paragraph 2, of R.A. No. 9946.

 In 
Gruba
, the Court elucidated that the term "retirement"
 may be understood either in its strict sense or broad sense. When used 
in a strict legal sense, the term refers to mandatory or optional 
retirement. However, when used in a more general sense, "retire" may 
encompass the concepts of both disability retirement and death.

It seems from the position taken by the TWG that the term 
"retired" under Section 3, paragraph 2, of R.A. No. 9946 is used in its 
strict sense, i.e., the justice or judge who is considered "retired" 
must be one who had reached certain age and length of service conditions
 only, just like a justice or judge who is eligible to retire 
optionally. A reading of the entire law, however, reveals that it also 
refers to justices and judges who "retire" due to 
permanent disability
, whether total or partial, and justices or judges who 
died
 or were 
killed while in actual service
.

 Particularly significant for the present purposes is the discussion in 
Gruba
 of the meaning of the term "
retired
"
 found in the retroactivity clause, Section 3-B, that was added to R.A. 
No. 910. The material portion of the resolution is reproduced, thus -



 Republic Act No. 9946 provides for a retroactivity clause Section 4, adding Section 3-B to Republic Act No. 910:




 SEC. 3-B. The benefits under this Act shall be granted to all those who have 
retired
 prior to the effectivity of this Act: 
Provided
, That the benefits shall be applicable only to the members of the Judiciary: 
Provided, further,
 That the benefits to be granted shall be prospective. (emphasis supplied)




 An initial look at the law might suggest that the retroactivity of
 Republic Act No. 9946 is limited to those who retired prior to the 
effectivity of the law. However, a holistic treatment of the law will 
show that the set of amendments provided by Republic Act No. 9946 is not
 limited to justices or judges who retired after reaching a certain age 
and a certain number of years in service. The changes in the law also 
refer to justices or judges who "retired" due to permanent disability or
 partial permanent disability as well as justices or judges who died 
while in active service.


 In the light of these innovations provided in the law, the word 
"retired" in Section 3-B should be construed to include not only those 
who already retired under Republic Act No. 910 but also those who 
retired due to permanent disability. It also includes judges and 
justices who died or were killed while in service. 


Providing retroactivity to judges and justices who died while in 
service conforms with the doctrine that retirement laws should be 
liberally construed and administered in favor of persons intended to be 
benefited. [T]he liberal approach aims to achieve the humanitarian 
purposes of the law in order that the efficiency, security, and 
well-being of government employees may be enhanced. Ensuring the welfare
 of families dependent on government employees is achieved in the 
changes made in Republic Act No. 9946. It will be consistent with the 
humanitarian purposes of the law if the law is made retroactive to 
benefit the heirs of judges and justices who passed away prior to the 
effectivity of Republic Act No. 9946.
[16]




 Even if the discussion by the Court on the interpretation of the term "
retired
"
 is in reference to Section 3-B, it is reasonable to apply the same 
interpretation in the construction of the same term found in Section 3, 
paragraph 2. It should be stressed that the said term qualifies the 
words "justices or judges" to whom the benefits under the law are 
granted. In turn, such benefits referred to under the said provision of 
law are the same benefits as elsewhere mentioned. A statute must be so 
construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever
 possible.
[17]
 There would be 
more confusion rather than harmony in the provisions if the meaning of 
the same term in one paragraph should be different from that found in 
another.
 To reiterate, Section 3, paragraph 2, of R.A. No. 9946 
also refers to the legitimate surviving spouses of justices or judges 
who "retired" due to permanent disability or partial permanent 
disability as well as to justices or judges who died or were killed 
while in active service.





The benefits under R.A. No. 9946 also extend to Court Administrators or Deputy Court Administrators.






The TWG posits that the justices or judges who "retired" or "eligible
 to retire optionally" referred to in Section 3, paragraph 2 of R.A. No.
 9946 also include those who became Court Administrators and Deputy 
Court Administrators (DCAs).
[18]
 Its basis is Section 3 of Presidential Decree No. 828 (P.D. No. 828), as amended by P.D. No. 842, which provides: 



Section 3. 
Qualifications, appointment and tenure
. The 
Court Administrator and the Deputy Court Administrators shall have the 
same qualifications as Justices of the Court of Appeals. They shall be 
appointed by the Supreme Court and shall serve until they reach the age 
of sixty-five (65) years or become incapacitated to discharge the duties
 of their office, but may be removed or relieved for just cause by a 
vote of not less than eight (8) Justices of the Supreme Court; provided 
that 
a member of the Judiciary appointed to any of the 
positions, shall not be deemed thereby to have lost the rank, seniority,
 precedence, benefits, and other privileges appertaining to his judicial
 position
, and his service in the Judiciary, to all intents and
 purposes, shall be considered as continuous and uninterrupted. 
(emphasis supplied)
  




 The TWG clarifies that survivorship benefits shall be available to 
the legitimate spouse if it is shown that the deceased, at the time of 
his/her death, was 
(1)
 a justice or judge, 
or
 
(2)
 a justice or judge who was appointed as a Court Administrator or DCA.
[19]

 Deducing the view of the TWG, the legitimate surviving spouse of a 
Court Administrator or DCA who has not previously served as a justice or
 judge cannot be entitled to survivorship benefits under Section 3, 
paragraph 2 of R.A. No. 9946. 

We agree.

 The benefits granted by R.A. No. 9946 are applicable to "members of the Judiciary"
[20]
 only. The phrase "members of the Judiciary"
[21]
 had been interpreted in many cases
[22]

 to mean justices of the Supreme Court or lower collegiate courts and 
judges of lower courts. However, as correctly pointed out by the TWG, 
statutes may carve an exception as in the case of justices or judges who
 are later on appointed as Court Administrators or Deputy Court 
Administrators.
[23]
 P.D. No. 
828, as amended by P.D. No. 842, is one such law that expressly 
recognizes that the judicial rank, privileges and other benefits of a 
member of the judiciary are not lost by his/her appointment to the 
position of Court Administrator or Deputy Court Administrator. Such was 
our holding in 
Re: Application for Survivorship Pension Benefits 
under R.A. No. 9946 of Court Administrator Ernani Cruz PaÃ±o [Mrs. 
Estrella C. PaÃ±o] (PaÃ±o)
.
[24]


 As narrated in 
PaÃ±o
, Ernani Cruz PaÃ±o served as 
District Judge and RTC Judge before his appointments as DCA and later as
 Court Administrator. His application for disability retirement under 
R.A. No. 910 was approved on 7 May 1996. Ten years after his disability 
retirement, the Court granted him a monthly pension based on R.A. 910. 
He died on 6 December 2011, or after the passage of R.A. No. 9946. His 
surviving spouse, Mrs. PaÃ±o, applied for survivorship benefits. Even if 
he retired as a Court Administrator, we considered PaÃ±o a "member of the
 Judiciary" for purposes of R.A. No. 9946 because he is deemed to have 
maintained his service as such member of the Judiciary pursuant to 
Section 3 of P.D. No. 828, as amended by P.D. No. 842.
[25]

 This was the same reason why his application for disability retirement,
 and later monthly pension, under R.A. No. 910 was approved by this 
Court in the first place. We said:



 [T]he law creating the Office of the Court Administrator in the 
Supreme Court specifically provides that when "a member of the 
Judiciary," i.e., a Justice or a Judge, is appointed as either Court 
Administrator or Deputy Court Administrator, he/she "shall not be deemed
 to have lost the rank, seniority, precedence, benefits and other 
privileges appertaining to his judicial position, and his service in the
 Judiciary, to all intents and purposes, shall be considered continuous 
and uninterrupted." This makes such a Deputy Court Administrator or 
Court Administrator eligible to the retirement benefits under Republic 
Act No. 910, as amended by Republic Act No. 9946, which provides that 
the benefits under the said law "shall be applicable only to members of 
the Judiciary." 


 For purposes of pension and other benefits granted under Republic 
Act No. 9946, this Court finds it reasonable that Section 3 of 
Presidential Decree No. 828, as amended, also covers members of the 
Judiciary who have been appointed to the position of Assistant Court 
Administrator and, subsequently, to the position of Deputy Court 
Administrator, at least. This is so because it is axiomatic that 
retirement or pension laws are liberally construed and administered in 
favour of the persons intended to be benefitted. All doubts as to the 
intent of the law should be resolved in favour of the retiree to achieve
 its humanitarian purposes. The liberal approach aims to achieve the 
humanitarian purposes of the law in order that efficiency, security and 
well-being of government employees may be enhanced.
[26]
 




Thus, we granted Mrs. PaÃ±o's application for survivorship benefits. We further explained:




 Going back to the case of Court Administrator PaÃ±o, by nature of 
the above-quoted provision of Section 3 of Presidential Decree No. 828, 
as amended, Court Administrator PaÃ±o who was a Regional Trial Court 
Judge when he was appointed Deputy Court Administrator in September 1990
 (and subsequently promoted as Court Administrator in March 1992) is 
deemed to have maintained his service as a member of the Judiciary 
during his tenure as Deputy Court Administrator and later Court 
Administrator. He was entitled to and granted a 10-year lump sum 
gratuity retirement benefits as he had rendered more than fifteen (15) 
years of service in the Judiciary when he retired due to disability on 
July 1, 1996. 


 As a consequence, the application of the spouse of Court 
Administrator PaÃ±o should be GRANTED as she is entitled to the 
survivorship benefits granted in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9946 to 
the surviving spouse of a deceased "Justice or Judge of any court in the
 Judiciary" who "has retired, or was eligible to retire optionally at 
the time of his death," although her spouse retired as Court 
Administrator.
[27]




 We applied the same principle in 
A.M. No. 14082-Ret
., entitled 
Re:
 Application for Survivorship Pension Benefits under Republic Act No. 
9946 filed by Mr. Salvador C. Vilches, surviving spouse of the late 
Deputy Court Administrator Nimfa C. Vilches
.
[28]

 We considered DCA Vilches as covered by R.A. No. 9946 as she was 
formerly a Municipal Trial Court Judge and RTC Judge before her 
promotion as Assistant Court Administrator and later as DCA. 
Consequently, we granted a 10-year lump sum gratuity in favor of the 
heirs of DCA Vilches.
[29]
 On the other hand, we denied survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse of DCA Juanito C. Ranjo in 
Re: Application for Survivorship Pension Benefits of Hon. Juanito C. Ranjo, Former Deputy Court Administrator
.
[30]
 There, we found that DCA Ranjo did not serve as a justice or judge prior to his appointment as DCA, thus -



 The service records of Deputy Court Administrator Ranjo show that 
he was Clerk of Court I prior to his appointment as Deputy Court 
Administrator. He is not covered by Section 3 of Presidential Decree No.
 828, as amended, as he is not a member of the Judiciary appointed to 
the position of Deputy Court Administrator or Court Administrator. He 
could not have been entitled to the benefits under Republic Act No. 9946
 and his widow is not entitled to survivorship pension benefits.
[31]
 




Unmistakably, the phrase "members of the Judiciary," which appears in
 the title, Section 3-A and Section 3-B of R.A. No. 9946, should be read
 as to include Court Administrators or DCAs, provided they had served as
 justices and judges before their appointment as such Court 
Administrators or DCAs.






Surviving spouses of justices and judges who died in actual service are entitled to survivorship benefits.






There is no question that even 
prior
 to R.A. No. 9946, 
justices or judges who are considered retired due to disability are 
granted lump sum retirement pay as gratuity benefits. They are further 
entitled to a lifetime monthly pension if they survive the gratuity 
period. Likewise, the heirs of justices or judges who died while in 
actual service are, subject to other qualifications, entitled to death 
benefits:








(a)


10-year lump sum gratuity if the deceased had rendered at least 20 years of government service;














(b)


5-year lump sum gratuity if government service is less than 20 years.








The law did not provide for monthly pension in case of death while in actual service.


 The retirement benefits by reason of disability, as well as death 
benefits, had been retained in R.A. No. 9946. However, the new law, 
aside from reducing the length of service from 20 years to 15 years, 
grants full monthly pension benefits in favor of retirees, regardless of
 age, due to permanent disability with 15 years of service; whereas, 
pro-rata

 monthly pension benefits are given to those with less than 15 years of 
service. In case of their death, the surviving legitimate spouses 
substitute them and are entitled to survivorship pension benefits 
equivalent to the same amount that their spouses are receiving or would 
have received (full or 
pro-rata
, as the case may be) had they not died. 
There is likewise no express mention of monthly pension benefits, even 
pro rata
, to be given to the legitimate surviving spouse or heirs of the justices or judges who died while in actual service.


 In 
Gruba
, the Court recognized that "death," in the 
spirit of liberal construction of retirement laws, is construed as a 
disability retirement. Citing 
Re: Retirement Benefits of the late City Judge Galang, Jr. (Galang)
, the Court said that "there is no more permanent or total physical disability than death."
[32]
 The Court said:



 Disability retirement is conditioned on the incapacity of the 
employee to continue his or her employment due to involuntary causes 
such as illness or accident. The social justice principle behind 
retirement benefits also applies to those who are forced to cease from 
service due to disabilities beyond their control. 


 x x x x


 Retiring due to physical disabilities is not far removed from the 
situation involving death of a judge or justice. This explains why 
retirement laws necessarily include death benefits.
[33]




 In the earlier case of 
Alvor
, the Court likewise treated 
death as a permanent disability under R.A. No. 9946 for the purpose of 
granting pro-rated survivorship benefits. The Court also quoted 
Galang

 that "there is no more permanent or total disability than death" in 
justifying the treatment of death as a disability retirement. It was 
obviously for the very same social justice principle that moved the 
lawmakers to upgrade and enhance the retirement benefits of justices and
 judges that the Court resolved 
Alvor
 in favor of granting survivorship benefits.

 We hold that the surviving spouses of justices and judges who 
died or were killed while in actual service are entitled to survivorship
 benefits based on 
total permanent disability
. Had the 
justice or judge not died, but merely became incapacitated to discharge 
the duties of his/her office, he/she would have been entitled to a full 
monthly pension after the 10-year gratuity period 
if the length of service is at least 15 years
, or 
pro rata

 monthly pension if otherwise. In case of subsequent death, he/she would
 have been substituted by the surviving spouse who will receive the same
 amount as survivorship benefit.
 For purposes of survivorship 
benefits, it is more consistent with logic and reason that we read into 
the law the inclusion of such benefits in favor of the surviving spouses
 of justices or judges who, regardless of age, died while in service. In
 so holding, we recognize that the dire situation of the surviving 
spouses of justices or judges who were retired due to permanent 
disability is no different from those whose spouses were retired due to 
death. 
 Thus, in the case of a justice or judge who, by reason of
 his death while in actual service, is considered retired due to 
permanent disability, his/her legitimate surviving spouse is entitled to
 survivorship benefit, the amount of which shall be determined by the 
length of service of the deceased justice or judge: that is, full 
monthly pension if the length of service is at least 15 years, or 
pro rata
 monthly pension if less than 15 years. 

 It must be clarified, however, that the survivorship benefit, which is 
on top of the death benefits granted under Section 2 of R.A. No. 9946, 
is conditioned on the survival by the surviving spouse of the gratuity 
period of 
10 years
 provided for total permanent 
disability. This should cover those who died in service but with less 
than 15 years of service. That is, even though the lump sum gratuity is 
equivalent to 5 years of salary, the payment of survivorship pension 
should commence only after the lapse of 10 years, not 5 years. 
Otherwise, with a shorter waiting period of only 5 years, the surviving 
spouses of justices or judges who died in service but with less than 15 
years of service would be placed in a more advantageous position 
compared to those whose deceased spouses were retired due to disability 
but with at least 15 years of service.
 Accordingly, we adopt the ruling in 
Alvor
. The case of 
Gruba

 is not controlling in respect to survivorship pension benefits in favor
 of the surviving spouses of the justices or judges who died or were 
killed while in service. This ruling also applies to justices or judges 
who, as previously explained, were appointed as Court Administrator or 
Deputy Court Administrator pursuant to Section 3 of Presidential Decree 
No. 828, as amended.





Surviving legitimate spouses entitled to the automatic adjustment of survivorship benefits






The basic provision on automatic increase in the pension of justices and judges is found in Section 3-A, which we reproduce:



 Sec. 3-A. 
All pension benefits
 of retired members of the 
Judiciary shall be automatically increased whenever there is an increase
 in the salary of the same position from which he/she retired, (emphasis
 supplied)




 On the other hand, paragraph 2, Section 3 provides that "[u]pon the 
death of a Justice or Judge of any court in the Judiciary, if such 
Justice or Judge has retired, or was eligible to retire optionally at 
the time of death, the surviving legitimate spouse shall be entitled to 
receive 
all the retirement benefits
 that the deceased Justice or Judge would have received had the Justice or Judge not died."
[34]

 Section 3-A should not be read in isolation, but in conjunction with 
paragraph 2, Section 3. The particular words, clauses, and phrases 
should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the 
whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the 
meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole.
[35]

 In short, every meaning to be given to each word or phrase must be 
ascertained from the context of the body of the statute since a word or 
phrase in a statute is always used in association with other words or 
phrases and its meaning may be modified or restricted by the latter.
[36]

 Consistent with the foregoing principle, the phrase "all the retirement
 benefits" appearing in paragraph 2, Section 3 must be understood as 
subject to, rather than exclusive of, the adjustment for increases 
referred to in Section 3-A. The retirement benefits referred to under 
the law include pension benefits. The phrase "all the retirement 
benefits" is unqualified. 
Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguire debemus.
 When the law does not distinguish, we must not distinguish.
[37]

 Had the justice or judge not died, the automatic increase in the 
pension benefit would have been applied in favor of the justice or 
judge. And since survivorship pension benefit emanates from the pension 
benefit due the justice or judge, it follows necessarily that the 
surviving legitimate spouse is entitled to the adjustment pursuant to 
the provision on automatic increase. Such interpretation is more in 
keeping with the beneficent purposes of R.A. No. 9946 which, in the 
first place, was enacted to benefit the surviving legitimate spouses of 
justices and judges.
[38]
 In his Explanatory Note to Senate Bill No. 121,
[39]
 Senator Juan Ponce Enrile explained:



 The compulsory retirement age of a Justice and Judge is seventy 
(70) years old. Most of the retirees, more often than not, within a few 
years after retirement, spend their benefits and pension on medications 
and hospital bills. When they pass away, there will be nothing left for 
their family, especially their spouse, who supported the deceased in 
choosing a career in public service. The upgrading and enhancement of 
retirement benefits of qualified Justices and Judges, which will now 
include survivorship benefits for their spouses, is a fitting way to 
give appreciation to these members of the judiciary for their length of 
service in the government, devoting their minds and talents for justice 
to prevail in our land. 




 Given, however, that the salaries of justices and judges had since 
been increased by virtue of the 1st and 2nd tranches of salary increases
 under EO No. 201, series of 2016, effective 1 January 2016, the 
corresponding survivorship pension benefits of all those who are 
entitled must also be increased pursuant to Section 3-A of R.A. No. 
9946. As noted above, there were applications for survivorship benefits 
by surviving spouses that were approved but without the adjustment of 
salary increases directed by EO No. 201. These approved applications 
include those of the surviving spouses of justices and judges who died 
prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 9946 who are the subjects of this 
case.
 Consistent with the ruling laid down in the present case, 
beneficiaries of survivorship pension benefits who are presently 
receiving amounts which are not yet adjusted by the latest salary 
increases must be paid the differential equivalent to the excess of the 
adjusted amount over the amount actually received effective 1 January 
2016, to be charged against the amounts allotted for pension benefits 
under the General Appropriations Act.






Gruba case abandoned by the ruling in this case; resolution in Vilches also modified






To the extent affecting justices and judges who died prior to the 
effectivity of R.A. No. 9946 but who did not possess the requirements of
 eligibility for optional retirement, the Court hereby declares as 
abandoned the doctrine that their legitimate surviving spouses are not 
entitled to survivorship benefits.

 We clarify, on the basis of the foregoing discussion, that the 
legitimate surviving spouses of justices and judges who, regardless of 
age, died while in service, before and after the effectivity of R.A. No.
 9946, and with at least 15 years of service, are entitled to full 
monthly survivorship pension; and those whose deceased spouses had less 
than 15 years of service shall be entitled to 
pro rata
 monthly pension, subject to the automatic increase as provided in Section 3-A of R.A. No. 9946.
 Consequently, our Resolution in 
Gruba

 must be modified so as to entitle the applicant surviving spouse, Mrs. 
Gruba, survivorship benefits even though Judge Gruba was only 55 years 
old at the time of his death. Likewise, our Resolution in 
AM-14158-Ret
.
 in the case of DCA Vilches is also modified so that Mr. Vilches is also
 granted survivorship benefits even though DCA Vilches was also only 55
 years old at the time of her death. Considering that both Judge Gruba 
and DCA Vilches had rendered government service for at least 15 years, 
their legitimate surviving spouses are entitled to full pension 
benefits. The survivorship benefits herein granted shall be subject to 
the automatic increase as directed by Section 3-A of R.A. No. 9946.

It must be noted that in the Table of Retirement Benefits prepared by
 the TWG, only a lump sum of five (5) or ten (10) years gratuity shall 
be granted as death benefit to the heirs of a justice or judge who died 
while in service or was killed due to work. According to the TWG, no 
survivorship benefit is to be paid to the legitimate surviving spouse of
 the deceased justice or judge. This should be corrected as discussed 
herein. 





RAC 81-2010, or the Guidelines, amended accordingly






In line with our holding in this case, and as recommended by the OCA,
 the pertinent text of RAC 81-2010 should be correspondingly amended to 
incorporate the 
Alvor
 ruling which we had adopted in this resolution. 
Section E of RAC 81-2010, which contains the provision on survivorship 
benefits, should now read as follows:



 
E. Survivorship Pension Benefits


 The legitimate surviving spouse of a Justice or Judge who (1) has 
retired or was eligible to retire optionally at the time of death, and 
(2) was receiving or would have been entitled to receive a monthly 
pension, shall be entitled to receive the said benefits that the 
deceased Justice or Judge would have received had the Justice or Judge 
not died. 
Provided
, That the justice or judge who, regardless 
of age, died or was killed while in actual service shall be considered 
as retired due to permanent disability. 
Provided, further
, That 
the survivorship benefit shall be pro-rated if the deceased justice or 
judge had rendered government service for less than 15 years. 
The 
surviving spouse shall continue to receive such retirement benefits 
until the surviving spouse's death or remarriage. (emphasis added)




CONCLUSION
 
In fine, the
 Court rules that the beneficiaries of R.A. No. 9946, particularly in 
respect to survivorship pension benefits and their automatic increases, 
include the surviving legitimate spouses of justices and judges who had 
retired by any of the modes recognized in the law, that is, including 
those who were retired due to disability and those who, regardless of 
age and length of service, died while in actual service. The same rule 
applies in favor of surviving spouses of justices or judges who died 
prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 9946 by virtue of the retroactivity
 clause under Section 3-B.

 Our ruling today would go a long way in ensuring that the 
families left behind by justices and judges, who had chosen a career in 
the judiciary, are amply protected consistent with the aims and purposes
 that impelled Congress to introduce the changes in the old law. By the 
amendments in R.A. No. 9946, no longer would present members feel the 
insecurity of leaving their loved ones with little means to survive when
 they have gone. We likewise see it a significant factor to be 
considered by those who are able and competent in entering and devoting a
 life of service in the judiciary. This is the unmistaken intent of the 
lawmakers when they enacted R.A. No. 9946. We all support efforts to 
fulfill the salutary purposes of the law.

The Ponente's personal note


 The 
ponente
 deeply acknowledges the highly commendable 
efforts of Justice Antonio T. Carpio who made possible the passage of 
R.A. No. 9946 for the betterment of the welfare of the members of the 
judiciary and their families.

, we resolve to:

No person shall be appointed

 natural-born citizen of the Philippines. A Member of the Supreme Court

years or more, a judge of a lower court or engaged in the practice of 
law in the Philippines.

 The Court, 
however, denied the application for survivorship benefits because DCA 
Vilches did not retire but died while in service. At the time of her 
death, DCA Vilches was only 55 years old, thus, not eligible to retire 
optionally. This was the Court's basis in denying Mr. Vilches the 
claimed survivorship benefits. As will be discussed subsequently, 
survivorship benefits should be granted under any of the modes of 
retirement, including death.

 It is not 
suggested that the words and phrases of R.A. No. 9946 as interpreted in 
this case are ambiguous. It is a basic canon of interpretation that one 
need not go outside of the text of the statute when the terms thereof 
are clear. A look into the records of Congress in this case is made only
 for the purpose of fortifying the Court's interpretation.
