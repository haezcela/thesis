[ G.R. No. 225142, September 13, 2017 ]


NYK-FIL SHIP MANAGEMENT, INCORPORATED, PETITIONER, V. GENER G. DABU, RESPONDENT.


D E C I S I O N




PERALTA, J.:


Before us is a petition for review on 
certiorari 
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which seeks to set aside the Amended Decision
[1]
 dated March 3, 2016 and the Resolution
[2]
 dated June 9, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 139266. 
  
 The antecedent facts are as follows: 
 Petitioner 
NYK-Fil Ship Management, Inc., a local manning agent acting for and in 
behalf of its foreign principal NYK Ship Management Pte. Ltd. Singapore,
 hired respondent Gener G. Dabu to work as oiler for nine months on 
board the vessel M/V Hojin with a monthly basic salary of  US$584.00, 
among others.
[3]
 Their 
contract of employment was covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement 
known as "IBF JSU/AMOSUP-IMMAJ CBA which was effective from January 1, 
2012 to December 31, 2014.
[4]
 Respondent underwent a pre-employment medical examination (
PEME
)
 on March 25, 2013 where he disclosed that he has diabetes mellitus. The
 doctor who conducted the PEME noted that respondent has diabetes 
mellitus type 2, controlled with medications.
[5]


On April 6, 2013, respondent embarked the vessel and discharged
 his duty as oiler. On April 8, 2013, he had palpitations, pains all 
over the body, numbness of hands and legs, lack of sleep and 
nervousness. On April 10, 2013, he consulted a doctor in Sri Lanka who 
found him with elevated blood sugar level and was suffering from 
diabetes mellitus, and declared him unfit for sea duty.
[6]
 He was repatriated to Manila on April 12, 2013.
[7]

 Upon his arrival, he was immediately referred to the company-designated
 physician at NGC Medical Specialist Clinic, Inc. who examined him. 
Respondent was asked to undergo a series of laboratory tests where the 
results showed that he has diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled.  
Respondent had undergone many follow up examinations with corresponding 
laboratory tests as he continued to complain of palpitations, pains all 
over his body with easy fatigability, and was prescribed medicines and 
eventually placed on insulin treatment.
[8]


 On July 18, 2013, the company-designated physician declared that respondent's diabetes mellitus is not work-related.
[9]

 However, respondent's treatment was continued for a maximum period of 
130 days. Respondent continued his follow-up consultations as he still 
complained of body pains and weakness and was prescribed medicines.
[10]

 On August 22, 2013, the company-designated physician reiterated her 
findings that respondent's diabetes mellitus is not work-related.
[11]

 Respondent wrote letters to petitioner appealing for the continuation 
of his treatment since his sickness was work-related taking into account
 his 23 years of working in petitioner's various vessels.
[12]

 Respondent then consulted Dr. Efren R. Vicaldo of the Philippine Heart 
Center who found him suffering from diabetes mellitus, insulin 
requiring, Impediment Grade VII (41.80%) and declared him permanently 
unfit to resume work as a seaman in any capacity and his illness is 
considered work-aggravated/related.
[13]

 He also consulted Dr. Czarina Sheherazade Mae A. Miguel, an Internal 
Medicine Specialist, whose finding was the same as with Dr. Vicaldo's.
[14]

 Respondent sought payment of disability benefits, damages and 
attorney's fees from petitioner, but was denied. He requested for a 
grievance proceedings in accordance with the CBA, however, the parties 
did not reach any settlement. He then filed a notice to arbitrate with 
the National Conciliation Mediation Board (
NCMB
), and the parties were required to submit their position papers.
  
 On November 28, 2014, the NCMB-Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators (PVA) rendered a Decision, the decretal portion of which reads: 
  


 WHEREFORE, ALL THE ABOVE CONSIDERED, a Decision is hereby 
rendered ORDERING the respondents, jointly and severally, to pay 
complainant the following amounts: 




 (1)	Disability compensation in the amount of US$60,000.00 or 
its Peso equivalent at the time of payment plus 12% interest thereon;


 (2)	Attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award.


 All other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit. 




SO ORDERED.
[15]
 




Petitioner received a copy of the PVA decision on February 9, 2015 
and filed with the CA a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules 
of Court on February 24, 2015 alleging that the PVA committed serious 
errors in rendering its decision and sought to enjoin the PVA from 
enforcing its decision. Respondent filed its Comment and petitioner 
filed its Reply. The parties also filed their respective memoranda.   
  
 On April 27, 2015, the NCMB-PVA issued a Writ of Execution 
directing the satisfaction of the judgment award of the PVA, which 
petitioner had complied without prejudice to the outcome of their 
petition for review.
  
 On September 15, 2015, the CA issued its Decision,
[16]
 the dispositive portion of which reads:
  


 WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision of the
 NCMB-PVA dated November 28, 2014 in AC-971-RCMB-NCR-MVA-020-03-03-2014 
is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one entered DISMISSING respondent 
Dabu's complaint for lack of merit.
[17]




 Aggrieved, respondent filed a motion for reconsideration wherein 
he reiterated his argument raised in his memorandum that the petition 
should be dismissed for being filed out of time. 
 On March 3, 2016, the CA issued its Amended Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: 
  


 WHEREFORE, private respondent's motion for reconsideration is 
GRANTED. Accordingly, this Court's Decision dated September 15, 2015 is 
hereby RECALLED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered DISMISSING the 
petition for having been filed out of time.
[18]




 Petitioner moved for reconsideration, however, the CA denied the 
same in a Resolution dated June 9, 2016, the decretal portion of which 
states: 
  


 WHEREFORE, petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the Amended Decision dated March 3, 2016 [is] DENIED for lack of merit.
[19]




 Hence, this petition for review on the following argument, to wit:
  


 The Honorable Court of Appeals committed SERIOUS, REVERSIBLE AND
 GROSS ERROR IN LAW AND IN FACT in rendering an amended judgment and 
dismissing the Petitioner's appeal on the ground that it was allegedly 
filed out of time.
[20]




 We find no merit in the petition. 
 Art. 262-A of the Labor Code provides: 
  


 Art. 262-A. Procedures. x x x 


x x x x 


 The award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of 
Voluntary Arbitrators shall contain the facts and the law on which it is
 based. It shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days 
from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties.




 and Section 6, Rule VII of the NCMB Procedural Guidelines in the conduct of voluntary arbitration proceedings provides: 
  


 Section 6.
 Finality of Award or Decisions
. - Awards or 
decisions of voluntary arbitrator become final and executory after ten 
(10) calendar days from receipt of copies of the award or decision by 
the parties. 




 Clearly, the decision of the voluntary arbitrator becomes final 
and executory after 10 days from receipt thereof. The proper remedy to 
reverse or modify a voluntary arbitrators' or panel of voluntary 
arbitrators' decision is to appeal the award or decision via a petition 
under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
[21]

 And under Section 4 of Rule 43, the period to appeal to the CA is 15 
days from receipt of the decision. Notwithstanding, since Article 262-A 
of the Labor Code expressly provides that the award or decision of the 
voluntary arbitrator shall be final and executory after ten (10) 
calendar days from receipt of the decision by the parties, the appeal of
 the VA decision to the CA must be filed within 10 days. In 
Philippine Electric Corporation (PHILEC) v. Court of Appeals
,
[22]
 We held:
  


 It is true that Rule 43, Section 4 of the Rules of Court provides for a 15-day reglementary period for filing an appeal: 




 Section 4. Period of appeal. â The appeal shall be taken 
within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order
 or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication
 is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of 
petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in 
accordance with the governing law of the court or agency a quo. Only one
 (1) motion for reconsideration shall be allowed. Upon proper motion and
 the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration 
of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional
 period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for 
review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most 
compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.




 The 15-day reglementary period has been upheld by this court in a
 long line of cases. In AMA Computer College-Santiago City, Inc. v. 
Nacino, Nippon Paint Employees Union-OLALIA v. Court of Appeals, Manila 
Midtown Hotel v. Borromeo, and Sevilla Trading Company v. Semana, this 
court denied petitioners' petitions for review on certiorari since 
petitioners failed to appeal the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision within 
the 15-day reglementary period under Rule 43. In these cases, the Court 
of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal assailing the 
Voluntary Arbitrator's decision.


 
Despite Rule 43 providing for a 15-day period to appeal, we 
rule that the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision must be appealed before 
the Court of Appeals within 10 calendar days from receipt of the 
decision as provided in the Labor Code.


 Appeal is a "statutory privilege," which may be exercised "only 
in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law." 
"Perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only 
mandatory but also jurisdictional so that failure to do so rendered the 
decision final and executory, and deprives the appellate court of 
jurisdiction to alter the final judgment much less to entertain the 
appeal."


 
We ruled that Article 262-A of the Labor Code allows the 
appeal of decisions rendered by Voluntary Arbitrators. Statute provides 
that the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision "shall be final and executory 
after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or 
decision by the parties." Being provided in the statute, this 10-day 
period must be complied with; otherwise, no appellate court will have 
jurisdiction over the appeal. This absurd situation occurs when the 
decision is appealed on the 11th to 15th day from receipt as allowed 
under the Rules, but which decision, under the law, has already become 
final and executory.


 
Furthermore, under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the 
Constitution, this court "shall not diminish, increase, or modify 
substantive rights" in promulgating rules of procedure in courts. The 
10-day period to appeal under the Labor Code being a substantive right, 
this period cannot be diminished, increased, or modified through the 
Rules of Court.


 
In 
Shioji v. Harvey
, this court held that the "rules 
of court, promulgated by authority of law, have the force and effect of 
law, if not in conflict with positive law." Rules of Court are 
"subordinate to the statute." In case of conflict between the law and 
the Rules of Court, "the statute will prevail."


 
The rule, therefore, is that a Voluntary Arbitrator's award 
or decision shall be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 days
 from receipt of the award or decision. 
Should the aggrieved party 
choose to file a motion for reconsideration with the Voluntary 
Arbitrator, the motion must be filed within the same 10-day period since
 a motion for reconsideration is filed "within the period for taking an 
appeal."
[23]




 In this case, petitioner received the PVA decision on February 9, 
2015, and filed the petition for review 15 days after receipt thereof, 
i.e
.,
 on February 24, 2015. The CA, upon respondent's motion for 
reconsideration, rendered its Amended Decision dated March 3, 2016 
dismissing the petition and vacating the earlier decision it made 
granting the petition. The CA dismissed the petition for being filed out
 of time, citing the 
PHILEC
 case above-quoted. We find no error
 committed by the CA in dismissing the petition for being filed out of 
time as the petition was not filed within the 10 day period . Since the 
timely perfection of an appeal is jurisdictional, the CA has no more 
authority to act on the appeal filed by petitioner. The CA correctly 
held that inasmuch as the PVA decision had lapsed into finality, the 
same may no longer be modified in any respect. This is so because any 
amendment or alteration made which substantially affects the final and 
executory judgment would be null and void for lack of jurisdiction.
[24]


 In 
Labao v. Flores, et al.
,
[25]
 We held:
  


 Needless to stress, a decision that has acquired finality 
becomes immutable and unalterable and may no longer be modified in any 
respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous 
conclusions of fact or law and whether it will be made by the court that
 rendered it or by the highest court of the land. All the issues between
 the parties are deemed resolved and laid to rest once a judgment 
becomes final and executory; execution of the decision proceeds as a 
matter of right as vested rights are acquired by the winning party. Just
 as a losing party has the right to appeal within the prescribed period,
 the winning party has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of 
the decision on the case. After all, a denial of a petition for being 
time-barred is tantamount to a decision on the merits. Otherwise, there 
will be no end to litigation, and this will set to naught the main role 
of courts of justice to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and
 the maintenance of peace and order by settling justiciable 
controversies with finality.
[26]




 Petitioner contends that the PHILEC case finds no application in 
this case since at the time of the filing of the petition, the existing 
jurisprudence provides for 15 day period to appeal; that due to the 
proximity of time between the filing of the appeal on February 24, 2015 
and the promulgation of the PHILEC decision on December 10, 2014, it had
 no opportunity to obtain knowledge, either actual or constructive, of 
the new prescriptive period established therein; and that judicial 
notice may be taken that the promulgated decision had to undergo a 
protracted process before it finally reached its finality and can be 
disseminated or published for public information.
 We are not persuaded.

 To stress, Article 262-A of the Labor Code provides for a period often 
days to appeal the PVA's decision. The 10-day period to appeal under the
 Labor Code being a substantive right cannot be diminished, increased, 
or modified through the Rules of Court.
[27]
 The PHILEC decision merely applies what is stated in the existing law. In fact, as correctly pointed out by the CA, in 
Coca Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., Sales Force Union -PTGWO-Balais v. Coca Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.,
[28]
 (
Coca Cola
)
 a 2005 case, we had already affirmed the CA's dismissal of the petition
 filed with it on the ground that the appeal of the PVA decision was not
 filed within the 10 day period so that the PVA decision had already 
attained finality. While there are decisions subsequent to the Coca Cola
 case stating that a petition for review assailing the PVA decision must
 be filed within 15 days from receipt of the PVA decision, however, we 
reiterate in the PHILEC decision, which is the recent decision, that the
 voluntary arbitrator's decision must be appealed before the CA within 
10 calendar days from receipt of the decision as provided in the Labor 
Code. It bears stressing that the PHILEC case was decided on December 
10, 2014, while the petition was filed with the CA only on February 24, 
2014, consequently, the PHILEC decision applies to the instant case.
  
 Anent petitioner's allegation that he had not obtained 
knowledge of the prescriptive period stated in the PHILEC decision 
because of the proximity of time from its promulgation to the filing of 
the petition with the CA, there was no proof presented that the decision
 had not yet been published in the court's website at the time of the 
filing of the petition with the CA. 
  
As the PVA decision is already final and executory when 
petitioner filed the petition with the CA, the CA correctly dismissed 
the petition since it has no more appellate jurisdiction to review the 
decision. In 
Aliviado, et al. v. Procter and Gamble Phils, Inc.
,
[29]
 We held:
  


 The doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental 
considerations of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of 
occasional errors, the judgment of adjudicating bodies must become final
 and executory on some definite date fixed by law. The Supreme Court 
reiterated that the doctrine of immutability of final judgment is 
adhered to by necessity notwithstanding occasional errors that may 
result thereby, since litigations must somehow come to an end for 
otherwise, it would "be even more intolerable than the wrong and 
injustice it is designed to correct."




 
WHEREFORE
, the petition for review is 
DENIED
. The 
Amended Decision dated March 3, 2016 and the Resolution dated June 9, 
2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 139266 are hereby
