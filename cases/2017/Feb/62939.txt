ROMEO F. ARA AND WILLIAM A. GARCIA, PETITIONERS, V. DRA. FELY S. PIZARRO AND HENRY ROSSI, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




LEONEN, J.:


For a claim of filiation to succeed, it must 
be made within 
the period allowed, and supported by the evidence required under the 
Family Code.
  
 This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of
 the Rules of Court, asking that the Court of Appeals Decision
[1]
 dated August 1, 2008 
and Resolution
[2]
 
dated March 16, 2009, in CA-G.R. CV No. 00729 entitled "
Romeo 
F. Ara, Ramon A. Garcia, William A. Garcia, and Henry A. Rossi v. Dra. 
Fely S. Pizarro
,â which modified the Decision
[3]
 of the Regional Trial 
Court in Special Civil Action No. 337-03 entitled "
Romeo F. 
Ara, Ramon A. Garcia, William A. Garcia and Henry A. Rossi vs. Dra. Fely
 S. Pizarro
" for Judicial Partition, be set aside. 
  
Romeo F. Ara and William A. Garcia (petitioners), 
and Dra. Fely
 S. Pizarro and Henry A. Rossi (respondents) all claimed to be children 
of the late Josefa A. Ara (Josefa), who died on November 18, 
2002.
[4]


Petitioners assert that Fely S. Pizarro (Pizarro) 
was born to 
Josefa and her then husband, Vicente Salgado (Salgado), who died during 
World War II.
[5]
 
At some point toward the end of the war, Josefa met and lived with an 
American soldier by the name of Darwin Gray (Gray).
[6]

 Romeo F. Ara (Ara) was born from this relationship. Josefa later met a 
certain Alfredo Garcia (Alfredo), and, from this relationship, gave 
birth to sons Ramon Garcia (Ramon) and William A. Garcia 
(Garcia).
[7]
 
Josefa and Alfredo married on January 24, 1952.
[8]
 After Alfredo passed away, Josefa 
met an Italian missionary named Frank Rossi, who allegedly fathered 
Henry Rossi (Rossi).
[9]


 Respondent Pizarro claims that, to her knowledge, 
she is the only child of Josefa.
[10]

 Further, petitioner Garcia is recorded as a son of a certain Carmen 
Bucarin and Pedro Garcia, as evidenced by a Certificate of Live Birth 
dated July 19, 1950;
[11]
 and petitioner Ara is recorded as a son of 
spouses Jose Ara and Maria Flores, evidenced by his Certificate of Live 
Birth.
[12]
 Petitioners, together with 
Ramon and herein respondent Rossi (collectively, plaintiffs 
a 
quo
), verbally sought partition of the properties left by the
 deceased Josefa, which were in the possession of respondent 
Pizarro.
[13]
 The 
properties are enumerated as follows:
  
	Lot and other improvements located at 
Poblacion, Valencia City,
 Bukidnon with an area of One Thousand Two Hundred Sixty Eight (1,268) 
sq. m. in the name of Josefa Salgado covered by Katibayan ng Original na
 Titulo No. T-30333; 
 Tamaraw FX; and 

RCBC Bank Passbook in the amount of One Hundred 
Eight Thousand Pesos (Php 108,000.00) bank deposit.
[14]
 


Respondent Pizarro refused to partition these properties. 
Thus, plaintiffs 
a quo
 referred the dispute to the 
Barangay Lupon for conciliation and amicable settlement.
[15]


The parties were unable to reach an amicable 
settlement.
[16]
 
Thus, the Office of the Barangay Captain issued a Certification to File 
Action dated April 3, 2003.
[17]


 Plaintiffs 
a quo
 filed a 
Complaint dated April 9, 2003
[18]

 for judicial partition of properties left by the deceased Josefa, 
before the Regional Trial Court of Malaybalay City, Branch 9 (Trial 
Court). In her Answer, respondent Pizarro averred that, to her 
knowledge, she was the only legitimate and only child of Josefa.
[19]
 She denied that any 
of the plaintiffs 
a quo
 were her siblings, for lack
 of knowledge or information to form a belief on that matter.
[20]
 Further, the late 
Josefa left other properties mostly in the possession of plaintiffs 

a quo
,
 which were omitted in the properties to be partitioned by the trial 
court in Special Civil Action No. 337-03, enumerated in her counterclaim
 (Additional Properties).
[21]


 Respondent Pizarro filed her Pre-Trial Brief dated
 July 28, 
2003, which contained a proposed stipulation that the Additional 
Properties also form part of the estate of Josefa.
[22]
 Amenable to this proposal, 
plaintiffs
 a quo

 moved that the Additional Properties be included in the partition, in a
 Motion to Include in the Partition the Proposed Stipulation dated 
August 31, 2003.
[23]


 At the pre-trial, Ara, Garcia, and Ramon claimed a
 property of
 respondent Rossi as part of the estate of Josefa. This property was not
 alleged nor claimed in the original complaint. This compelled 
respondent Rossi to engage the services of separate counsel, as the 
claim of his property constituted a conflict of interest among the 
plaintiffs
 a quo
.
[24]


 In a Pre-trial Order issued by the Trial Court on 
October 1, 2003, the following facts were admitted:
  
	All the above mentioned 
fathers of the children in this case, 
Mr. Vicente Salgado, Mr. Darwin Grey [sic] and Henry Rosi (sic), are all
 deceased. Josefa Ara Salgado is also deceased having died on November 
18, 2002. 
 The properties mentioned in Paragraph 9 
of the counter-claim 
mentioned in the Answer filed by the defendant thru counsel are also 
admitted by both counsels to be part of the properties subject of this 
partition case.
The Katibayan Ng Orihinal na Titulo 
attached thereto as ANNEXES "C"-"C-1", are all admitted as the subject 
properties. 
Some properties involved maybe covered 
by the land reform 
program of the government and the parties have agreed that only the 
remainder thereof or the proceeds of compensation shall be partitioned 
among them. All these properties shall be properly determined during the
 inventory to be finally submitted to the Court for approval. 

 All the foregoing properties were acquired after 
the death of 
Vicente Salgado and presumably all the exclusive properties of Josefa 
Ara Salgado.
[25]


 After trial, on February 20, 2006, the Trial Court, issued a
 Decision. The decretal portion states:
  


 WHEREFORE, the Court renders a DECISION as 
follows:


 1.	Awarding the Baguio property to Henry Rossi, to be 
deducted from his share; 


2.	Awarding the Valencia property covered by OCT No. T- 
30333; 
Tamaraw FX and the RCBC Bank Deposit Passbook to defendant Fely S. 
Pizarro, to be deducted from her share; and


 3.	With respect to the other properties that may not be 
covered 
by the foregoing, the same are declared under the co-ownership of all 
the plaintiffs and defendant and in equal shares.


 SO ORDERED.
[26]




 Respondent Pizarro appealed the Trial Court Decision, 
claiming it 
erred in finding petitioners Ara and Garcia to be children of Josefa, 
and including them in the partition of properties.
[27]

 Petitioners Ara and Garcia, as well as respondent Rossi, also filed 
their own respective appeals to the Trial Court Decision. Respondent 
Rossi questioned the inclusion of his property in the inventory of 
properties of the late Josefa.
[28]

 Petitioners questioned the awarding of particular properties to, and 
deductions from the respective shares of, respondents Pizarro and 
Rossi.
[29]
 The Court of Appeals,
[30]
 on August 1, 2008, 
promulgated its Decision
[31]
 and held that only respondents Pizarro and 
Rossi, as well as plaintiff 
a quo
 Ramon, were the 
children of the late Josefa, entitled to shares in Josefa's estate:
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Appeals are 
PARTIALLY GRANTED. The assailed 
Decision
 dated 20 
February 2006, of the court 
a quo
,
 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The legitimate children of Josefa
 Ara, namely, Fely Pizarro and Ramon A. Garcia, are each entitled to one
 (1) share, while Henry Rossi, the illegitimate child of Josefa Ara, is 
entitled to one-half (1/2) of the share of a legitimate child, of the 
total properties of the late Josefa Ara sought to be partitioned 
[.]


 . . . .


 SO ORDERED.
[32]




 In omitting petitioners from the enumeration of Josefa's 
descendants, the Court of Appeals reversed the finding of the Trial 
Court. The Court of Appeals found that the Trial Court erred in allowing
 petitioners to prove their status as illegitimate sons of Josefa after 
her death:
  


 In holding that appellants William A. Garcia and Romeo F. 
Ara are the illegitimate sons of Josefa Ara, the court 
a 
quo
 ratiocinated:




 Without anymore discussing the validity of their 
respective 
birth and baptismal certificates, there is sufficient evidence to hold 
that all the plaintiffs are indeed the children of the said deceased 
Josefa Ara for having possessed and enjoyed the status of recognized 
illegitimate children pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 175 of 
the Family Code which provides:




 "Illegitimate children may establish their filiation 
in the same way and on the same evidence as legitimate 
children"




 in relation to the second paragraph No. (1) of Article 
172 of the same code (sic), which provides:




 "In the absence of the foregoing evidence, legitimate 
filiation shall be proven by:




 (1) the open and continuous possession of the status
 of a legitimate child."






 All the plaintiffs and defendant were taken care of and 
supported by their mother Josefa Ara, including their education, since 
their respective birth and were all united and lived as one family even 
up to the death and burial of their said mother, Josefa Ara. Their 
mother had acknowledged all of them as her children throughout all her 
life directly, continuously, spontaneously and without 
concealment.
[33]
 
(Emphasis omitted.)






 Petitioners, together with Garcia, and respondent Rossi 
filed 
separate Motions for Reconsideration, which were both denied by the 
Court of Appeals on March 16, 2009.
[34]
 Petitioners bring this 
Petition for Review on Certiorari.
[35]
 Respondents Pizarro and 
Rossi filed their respective Comments on the Petition.
[36]
 Petitioners filed a 
Reply to respondents' Comments, as well as a Motion to Submit Parties to
 DNA Testing,
[37]
 
which this Court denied. Memoranda were submitted by all the 
parties.

 Petitioners argue that the Court of Appeals erroneously applied Article
 285 of the Civil Code, which requires that an action for the 
recognition of natural children be brought during the lifetime of the 
presumed parents, subject to certain exceptions.
[38]

 Petitioners assert that during Josefa's lifetime, Josefa acknowledged 
all of them as her children directly, continuously, spontaneously, and 
without concealment.
[39]

 Petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals did not apply the second 
paragraph of Article 172 of the Family Code, which states that filiation
 may be established even without the record of birth appearing in the 
civil register, or an admission of filiation in a public or handwritten 
document.
[40]


 Further, petitioners aver that the Court of 
Appeals erred in 
its asymmetric application of the rule on establishing filiation. Thus, 
the Court of Appeals erred in finding that respondent Pizarro was a 
daughter of Josefa Ara and Vicente Salgado, asserting there was no basis
 for the same. Petitioners claim that, in her Formal Offer of Exhibits 
dated May 26, 2005, respondent Pizarro offered as evidence only a 
Certificate of Marriage of Salgado and Josefa to support her filiation 
to Josefa.
[41]


 On respondent Rossi, petitioners claim that there 
is no direct
 evidence to prove his filiation to Josefa, except for his Baptismal 
Certificate, which was testified to only by respondent Rossi.
[42]

 The primordial issue for this Court to resolve is whether petitioners 
may prove their filiation to Josefa through their open and continuous 
possession of the status of illegitimate children, found in the second 
paragraph of Article 172 of the Family Code.
 This 
Petition is denied. 
 
I


 On establishing the filiation of illegitimate 
children, the Family Code provides:
  


 Article 175. Illegitimate children may establish their 
illegitimate filiation in the same way and on the same evidence as 
legitimate children. 


 The action must be brought within the same period 
specified in 
Article 173, except when the action is based on the second paragraph of 
Article 172, in which case the action may be brought during the lifetime
 of the alleged parent. 




 Articles 172 and 173 of the Family Code provide: 
  


 Article 172. The filiation of legitimate children is 
established by any of the following: 








(1) 



The record of birth 
appearing in the civil register or a final judgment; 
or














(2) 



An admission of 
legitimate filiation 
in a public document or a private handwritten instrument and signed by 
the parent concerned.








In the absence of the foregoing evidence, the legitimate 
filiation shall be proved by: 








(1) 



The open and continuous 
possession of the status of a legitimate child; 
or














(2) 



Any other means allowed 
by the Rules of Court and special laws. (265a, 266a, 
267a)








Article 173. The action to claim legitimacy may be brought 
by the
 child during his or her lifetime and shall be transmitted to the heirs 
should the child die during minority or in a state of insanity. In these
 cases, the heirs shall have a period of five years within which to 
institute the action. 


 The action already commenced by the child shall survive 
notwithstanding the death of either or both of the parties. (268a) 





 Thus, a person who seeks to establish illegitimate filiation
 after
 the death of a putative parent must do so via a record of birth 
appearing in the civil register or a final judgment, or an admission of 
legitimate filiation. In 
Uyguangco v. Court of 
Appeals
:
[43]




 The following provision is therefore also available to the
 private respondent in proving his illegitimate filiation: 


Article. 172. The filiation of legitimate children is 
established by any of the following:


 . . . . 


 In the absence of the foregoing evidence, the legitimate 
filiation shall be proved by: 








(1) 



The open and 
continuous possession of the status of a legitimate child; 
or














(2) 



Any other means allowed 
by the Rules of Court and special laws.








While the private respondent has admitted that he has none 
of the
 documents mentioned in the first paragraph (which are practically the 
same documents mentioned in Article 278 of the Civil Code except for the
 "private handwritten instrument signed by the parent himself), he 
insists that he has nevertheless been "in open and continuous possession
 of the status of an illegitimate child," which is now also admissible 
as evidence of filiation. 


 Thus, he claims that he lived with his father from 1967 
until 
1973, receiving support from him during that time; that he has been 
using the surname Uyguangco without objection from his father and the 
petitioners as shown in his high school diploma, a special power of 
attorney executed in his favor by Dorotea Uyguangco, and another one by 
Sulpicio Uyguangco; that he has shared in the profits of the copra 
business of the Uyguangcos, which is a strictly family business; that he
 was a director, together with the petitioners, of the Alu and Sons 
Development Corporation, a family corporation; and that in the addendum 
to the original extrajudicial settlement concluded by the petitioners he
 was given a share in his deceased father's estate.


 It must be added that the illegitimate child is now also 
allowed
 to establish his claimed filiation by "any other means allowed by the 
Rules of Court and special laws," like his baptismal certificate, a 
judicial admission, a family Bible in which his name has been entered, 
common reputation respecting his pedigree, admission by silence, the 
testimonies of witnesses, and other kinds of proof admissible under Rule
 130 of the Rules of Court. 


 The problem of the private respondent, however, is that, 
since 
he seeks to prove his filiation under the second paragraph of Article 
172 of the Family Code, his action is now barred because of his alleged 
father's death in 1975. The second paragraph of this Article 175 reads 
as follows: 




 The action must be brought within the same period 
specified in
 Article 173, except when the action is based on the second paragraph of
 Article 172, in which case the action may be brought during the 
lifetime of the alleged parent. 




 It is clear that the private respondent can no longer be 
allowed
 at this time to introduce evidence of his open and continuous 
possession of the status of an illegitimate child or prove his alleged 
filiation through any of the means allowed by the Rules of Court or 
special laws. The simple reason is that Apolinario Uyguangco is already 
dead and can no longer be heard on the claim of his alleged son's 
illegitimate filiation.
[44]




 Petitioners did not present evidence that would prove their 
illegitimate filiation to their putative parent, Josefa, after her death
 as provided under Articles 172 and 175 of the Family 
Code.
 To recall, petitioners submitted the following 
to establish their filiation:
  






(1)


 
Garcia's 
Baptismal 
Certificate listing Josefa as his mother, showing that the baptism was 
conducted on June 1, 1958, and that Garcia was born on June 23, 
1951;
[45]








(2)


 
Garcia's Certificate of 
Marriage, listing Josefa as his mother;
[46]
 






(3)


 
A picture of Garcia's 
wedding, with Josefa and other relatives;
[47]






(4)


 
Certificate of Marriage 
showing that Alfredo and Josefa were married on January 24, 1952;
[48]








(5)


 
Garcia's Certificate of 
Live Birth from Paniqui, Tarlac, issued on October 23, 2003,
[49]

 under Registry No. 2003-1447, which is a late registration of his 
birth, showing he was born on June 23, 1951 to Alfredo and 
Josefa;
[50]






(6) 


A group picture of all the 
parties in the instant case.
[51]
 






(7)


 
In the Comment of Rossi to
 the Formal Offer of Exhibits of Pizarro, Rossi 
stated:








1. That William Garcia and 
Romeo Flores
 Ara are half brothers of Dr. Henry Rossi their mother being Josefa Ara,
 who did not register them as her children for fear of losing her 
pension from the U.S. Veterans Office;
[52]






(8) 


Ara testified that he was a
 son of the 
late Josefa and Gray, and that his record of birth was registered at 
camp Murphy, Quezon City;
[53]
 and






(9) 


Nelly Alipio, first degree 
cousin of Josefa, testified that Ara was a son of Josefa and 
Gray.
[54]








None of the foregoing constitutes evidence under the first 
paragraph of Article 172 of the Family Code.


 Although not raised by petitioners, it may be argued that 
petitioner Garcia's Certificate of Live Birth obtained in 2003 through a
 late registration of his birth is a record of birth appearing in the 
civil register under Article 172 of the Family Code.
 
True, birth certificates offer 
prima facie 
evidence
 of filiation. To overthrow the presumption of truth contained in a 
birth certificate, a high degree of proof is needed.
[55]

 However, the circumstances surrounding the delayed registration prevent
 us from according it the same weight as any other birth certificate.
  
 There is a reason why birth certificates are 
accorded such 
high evidentiary value. Act No. 3753, or An Act to Establish a Civil 
Register, provides:
  


 Section 5. 
Registration and Certification of 
Births
. â 
The declaration of the physician or midwife in attendance at the birth 
or, in default thereof, the declaration of either parent of the newborn 
child, shall be sufficient for the registration of a birth in the civil 
register. Such declaration shall be exempt from the documentary stamp 
tax and shall be sent to the local civil registrar not later than thirty
 days after the birth, by the physician, or midwife in attendance at the
 birth or by either parent of the newly born child.


 In such declaration, the persons above mentioned shall 
certify 
to the following facts: (a) date and hour of birth; (b) sex and 
nationality of infant; (c) names, citizenship, and religion of parents 
or, in case the father is not known, of the mother alone; (d) civil 
status of parents; (e) place where the infant was born; (f) and such 
other data may be required in the regulation to be issued. 


 In the case of an exposed child, the person who found the 
same 
shall report to the local civil registrar the place, date and hour of 
finding and other attendant circumstances. 


 In case of an illegitimate child, the birth certificate 
shall be
 signed and sworn to jointly by the parents of the infant or only the 
mother if the father refuses. In the latter case, it shall not be 
permissible to state or reveal in the document the name of the father 
who refuses to acknowledge the child, or to give therein any information
 by which such father could be identified. 


 Any foetus having human features which dies after twenty 
four 
hours of existence completely disengaged from the maternal womb shall be
 entered in the proper registers as having been born and having died. 





 Further, Rule 21 of National Statistics Office 
Administrative 
Order No. 1-93, or the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Act No. 
3753, provides that a person's birth be registered with the Office of 
the Civil Registrar-General by one of the following individuals: 
  


 Rule 21. 
Persons Responsible to Report the 
Event
. â (1)
 When the birth occurred in a hospital or clinic or in a similar 
institution, the administrator thereof shall be responsible in causing 
the registration of such birth. However, it shall be the attendant at 
birth who shall certify the facts of birth. 


 (2)	When the birth did not occur in a hospital or clinic 
or in a
 similar institution, the physician, nurse, midwife, "hilot", or anybody
 who attended to the delivery of the child shall be responsible both in 
certifying the facts of birth and causing the registration of such 
birth. 


 (3)	In default of the hospital/clinic administrator or 
attendant
 at birth, either or both parents of the child shall cause the 
registration of the birth. 


 (4)	When the birth occurs aboard a vehicle, vessel or 
airplane 
while in transit, registration of said birth shall be a joint 
responsibility of the driver, captain or pilot and the parents, as the 
case may be. 




 Further, the birth must be registered within 30 days from 
the time of birth.
[56]

 Thus, generally, the rules require that facts of the report be 
certified by an attendant at birth, within 30 days from birth. The 
attendant is not only an eyewitness to the event, but also presumably 
would have no reason to lie on the matter. The immediacy of the 
reporting, combined with the participation of disinterested attendants 
at birth, or of both parents, tend to ensure that the report is a 
factual reporting of birth. In other words, the circumstances in which 
registration is made obviate the possibility that registration is caused
 by ulterior motives. The law provides in the case of illegitimate 
children that the birth certificate shall be signed and sworn to jointly
 by the parents of the infant or only by the mother if the father 
refuses. This ensures that individuals are not falsely named as 
parents.

 National Statistics Office Administrative Order No. 1-93 also 
contemplates that reports of birth may be made beyond the 30-day period:
  


 Rule 25. 
Delayed Registration of Birth
.
 â (1) The requirements are:






a)


 if the person is less than eighteen (18) 
years old, the following shall be required:






 


 






 


i)


four (4) copies of the Certificate of Live Birth duly 
accomplished and signed by the proper parties;






 


ii)


accomplished Affidavit for Delayed 
Registration 
at the back of the Certificate of Live Birth by the father, mother or 
guardian, declaring therein, among other things, the following: 







 


 


> name of child; 
          > 
date and place of birth; 
          > name of the father
 if the child is illegitimate and has been acknowledged by 
him;
          > if legitimate, the date and place of 
marriage of parents; and
          > reason for not 
registering the birth within thirty (30) days after the date of 
birth.






 


 






 


In case the party seeking late 
registration of 
the birth of an illegitimate child is not the mother, the party shall, 
in addition to the foregoing facts, declare in a sworn statement the 
present whereabouts of the mother. 






 


 


 






 


iii)


any two of the following documentary evidences which 
may

 If the person is eighteen (18) years old

all the requirements for a child who is less than 
eighteen (18) years old; and

(3)


Upon receipt of the application for 
delayed 
registration of birth, the civil registrar shall examine the Certificate
 of Live Birth presented whether it has been completely and correctly 
filled up and all requirements complied with. (47a)






(4)


In the delayed registration of the birth 
of an 
alien, travel documents showing the origin and nationality of the 
parents shall be presented in addition to the requirements mentioned in 
Rule 25 (1). (49:2a)








Thus, petitioners submitted in evidence a delayed 
registration of 
birth of Garcia, pursuant to this rule. Petitioners point out that a 
hearing on the delayed registration was held at the Office of the 
Municipal Civil Registrar of Paniqui, Tarlac. No one appeared to oppose 
the delayed registration, despite a notice of hearing posted at the 
Office of the Civil Registrar.
[57]
 


It is analogous to cases where a putative father's name is 
written 
on a certificate of live birth of an illegitimate child, without any 
showing that the putative father participated in preparing the 
certificate. In
 Fernandez v. Court of 
Appeals:
[58]




Fourth, the certificates of live birth (Exh. "A"; Exh. "B")
 of 
the petitioners identifying private respondent as their father are not 
also competent evidence on the issue of their paternity. Again, the 
records do not show that private respondent had a hand in the 
preparation of said certificates. In rejecting these certificates, the 
ruling of the respondent court is in accord with our pronouncement in 

Roces vs. Local Civil Registrar, 102 Phil. 1050 
(1958),viz
:




 ". . . Section 5 of Act No. 3793 and Article 280 of the 
Civil 
Code of the Philippines explicitly prohibited, not only the naming of 
the father or the child born outside wedlock, when the birth 
certificates, or the recognition, is not filed or made by him, but, 

also,
 the statement of any information or circumstances by which he could be 
identified. Accordingly, the Local Civil Registrar had no authority to 
make or record the paternity of an illegitimate child upon the 
information of a third person and the certificate of birth of an 
illegitimate child, when signed only by the mother of the latter, is 
incompetent evidence of fathership of said child
.




 We reiterated this rule in 
Berciles, op. 
cit.
, when we 
held that "a birth certificate not signed by the alleged father therein 
indicated is not competent evidence of paternity."
[59]
 (Emphasis in the original). 





In 
Berciles v. Government Service Insurance 
System
:
[60]




 The evidence considered by the Committee on Claims 
Settlement as
 basis of its finding that Pascual Voltaire Berciles is an acknowledged 
natural child of the late Judge Pascual Berciles is the birth 
certificate of said Pascual Voltaire Berciles marked Exh. "6". We have 
examined carefully this birth certificate and We find that the same is 
not signed by either the father or the mother; We find no participation 
or intervention whatsoever therein by the alleged father, Judge Pascual 
Berciles. Under our jurisprudence, if the alleged father did not 
intervene in the birth certificate, the putting of his name by the 
mother or doctor or registrar is null and void. Such registration would 
not be evidence of paternity. (Joaquin P. Roces et al. vs. Local Civil 
Registrar of Manila, 102 Phil. 1050). The mere certificate by the 
registrar without the signature of the father is not proof of voluntary 
acknowledgment on his part (Dayrit vs. Piccio, 92 Phil. 729). A birth 
certificate does not constitute recognition in a public instrument. 
(Pareja vs. Pareja, et al., 95 Phil. 167). A birth certificate, to 
evidence acknowledgment, must, under Section 5 of Act 3753, bear the 
signature under oath of the acknowledging parent or parents. 
(Vidaurrazaga vs. Court of Appeals and Francisco Ruiz, 91 Phil. 
492).


....


  In the case of Mendoza, et al. vs. Mella, 17 SCRA 788, 
the 
Supreme Court speaking through Justice Makalintal who later became chief
 Justice, said:




 It should be noted, however, that a Civil Registry Law 
was 
passed in 1930 (Act No. 3753) containing provisions for the registration
 of births, including those of illegitimate parentage; and the record of
 birth under such law, if sufficient in contents for the purpose, would 
meet the requisites for voluntary recognition even under Article 131. 
Since Rodolfo was born in 1935, after the registry law was enacted, the 
question here really is whether or not his birth certificate (Exhibit 
1), which is merely a certified copy of the registry record, may be 
relied upon as sufficient proof of his having been voluntarily 
recognized. No such reliance, in our judgment, may be placed upon it. 
While it contains the names of both parents, there is no showing that 
they signed the original, let alone swore to its contents as required in
 Section 5 of Act No. 3753 (Vidaurrazaga vs. Court of Appeals, 91 Phil. 
493; In re Adoption of Lydia Duran, 92 Phil. 729). For all that might 
have happened, it was not even they or either of them who furnished the 
data to be entered in the civil register. Petitioners say that in any 
event the birth certificate is in the nature of a public document 
wherein voluntary recognition of a natural child may also be made, 
according to the same Article 131. True enough, but in such a case there
 must be a clear statement in the document that the parent recognizes 
the child as his or her own (Madridejo vs. De Leon, 55 Phil. 1); and in 
Exhibit 1 no such statement appears. The claim of voluntary recognition 
is without basis."
[61]






 Further, in 
People v. Villar
,
[62]

 this Court sustained the Trial Court's rejection of a delayed 
registration of birth as conclusive evidence of the facts stated 
therein:
  


  In the resolution of the sole assignment of error we find
 as 
well-taken and accordingly adopt as our own the lower court's 
ratiocination, thus:




 After going over the evidence in support of the alleged 
minority of the accused Francisco Villar when he committed the crime on 
or about August 24, 1977, the Court finds that Exhibit 1 and the 
testimonies of the defense witnesses can not have more probative value 
than the written statement of Francisco Villar, Exhibit E. It is to be 
noted that Exhibit 1 is a delayed registration of a supposed birth 
accomplished and submitted only on January 12, 1979 to the Local Civil 
Registrar of Caloocan City by the witness Leonor Villar, long after the 
offense was committed and after the prosecution finally rested its case 
on November 21, 1978, thus exposing the basis of Exhibit 1 to be resting
 on a slender and shaky foundation, and more so, in the absence of 
explanation from the defense of the reason for said late registration. 
Hence, the Court rejects Exhibit 1....


 The appellant invokes Art. 410 of the Civil Code which 
reads:


 Art. 410. The books making up the civil register and all
 
documents relating thereto shall be considered public documents and 
shall be prima facie evidence of the facts herein contained.




 Suffice it to say that the above-quoted provision makes 
the information given in Exhibit 1 only 
prima facie 

but
 not conclusive evidence. This must be so because the Local Civil 
Registrar merely receives the information submitted to him; he does not 
inquire into its veracity. Moreover, to regard as conclusive the content
 of a certificate of live birth can lead to absurd results. Supposing 
that Leonor had given John F. Kennedy as the father of Francisco, are we
 to accept that as an incontestable fact? In the light of the 
circumstances already narrated concerning the preparation and submission
 of Exhibit 1, the lower court committed no error in disregarding 
it.
[63]




 A delayed registration of birth, made after the death of the
 putative parent, is tenuous proof of filiation.

 Thus, we are unable to accord petitioner Garcia's delayed registration 
of birth the same evidentiary weight as regular birth 
certificates.

 Even without a record of birth appearing in the civil register or a 
final judgment, filiation may still be established after the death of a 
putative parent through an admission of filiation in a public document 
or a private handwritten instrument, signed by the parent 
concerned.
[64]
 
However, petitioners did not present in evidence any admissions of 
filiation.
 An admission is an act, declaration, or 
omission of a party on a relevant fact, which may be used in evidence 
against him.
[65]

 The evidence presented by petitioners such as group pictures with 
Josefa and petitioners' relatives, and testimonies do not show that 
Josefa is their mother. They do not contain any acts, declarations, or 
omissions attributable directly to Josefa, much less ones pertaining to 
her filiation with petitioners. Although petitioner Garcia's Baptismal 
Certificate, Certificate of Marriage, and Certificate of Live Birth 
obtained via late registration all state that Josefa is his mother, they
 do not show any act, declaration, or omission on the part of Josefa. 
Josefa did not participate in making any of them. The same may be said 
of the testimonies presented. Although Josefa may have been in the 
photographs, the photographs do not show any filiation. By definition, 
none of the evidence presented constitutes an admission of filiation 
under Article 172 of the Family Code.
 II


 The Trial Court bypassed the issue of the birth 
certificates 
and did not consider the first paragraph of Article 172 of the Family 
Code. Instead, it ruled only on the open and continuous possession of 
status of filiation:
  


 Without anymore discussing the validity of their 
respective 
birth and baptismal certificates, there is sufficient evidence to hold 
that all the plaintiffs are indeed the children of the said deceased 
Josefa Ara for having possessed and enjoyed the status of recognized 
illegitimate children pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 175 of 
the Family Code[.]


 . . . .


 All the plaintiffs and defendant were taken care of and 
supported by their mother Josefa Ara, including their education, since 
their respective birth and were all united and lived as one family even 
up to the death and burial of their said mother, Josefa Ara. Their 
mother had acknowledged all of them as her children throughout all her 
life directly, continuously, spontaneously and without 
concealment.
[66]




 Thus, the Court of Appeals found that the Trial Court had 
erred in
 allowing petitioners to prove their illegitimate filiation through the 
open and continuous possession of the status of illegitimate children 
after the death of the putative parent:
  


  However, the trial court's finding cannot be sustained. 
Even 
granting for the sake of argument that appellants Romeo F. Ara and 
William Garcia did enjoy open and continuous possession of the status of
 an illegitimate child, still, they should have proven this during the 
lifetime of the putative parent.
 Article 285 of the Civil 
Code
 provides the period for filing and 
(
sic
) action for recognition as follows:




 ART. 285. The action for the recognition of natural 
children 
may be brought only during the lifetime of the presumed parents, except 
in the following cases:








(1)


If the 
father or mother
 died during the minority of the child, in which case the latter may 
file the action before the expiration of four years from the attainment 
of his majority;














(2)


If after the death of 
the father or
 of the mother a document should appear of which nothing had been heard 
and in which either or both parents recognize the 
child.








In this case, the action must be commenced within four 
years from the finding of the document.




 The two exceptions provided under the foregoing provision,
 have however been omitted by 
Articles 172, 173
 and
 
175 of the Family Code
, which We quote:




 â¦




 The law is very clear. If filiation is sought to be proved
 under the 
second paragraph of Article 172 of the Family 
Code
,
 the action must be brought during the lifetime of the alleged parent. 
It is evident that appellants Romeo F. Ara and William Garcia can no 
longer be allowed at this time to introduce evidence of their open and 
continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child or prove 
their alleged filiation through any of the means allowed by the Rules of
 Court or special laws. The simple reason is that Josefa Ara is already 
dead and can no longer be heard on the claim of her alleged sons' 
illegitimate filiation.
[67]




 The Court of Appeals did not adopt the Trial Court's 
appreciation 
of evidence. It ruled that, because petitioners' putative parent Josefa 
had already passed away, petitioners were proscribed from proving their 
filiation under the second paragraph of Article 172 of the Family 
Code.
 The Court of Appeals properly did not give 
credence to the evidence submitted by petitioners regarding their 
status.
 Josefa passed away in 2002.
[68]

 After her death, petitioners could no longer be allowed to introduce 
evidence of open and continuous illegitimate filiation to Josefa. The 
only evidence allowed under the law would be a record of birth appearing
 in the civil register or a final judgment, or an admission of 
legitimate filiation in a public document or a private signed, 
handwritten instruction by Josefa.
 An alleged parent 
is the best 
person to affirm or deny a putative descendant's filiation. Absent a 
record of birth appearing in a civil register or a final judgment, an 
express admission of filiation in a public document, or a handwritten 
instrument signed by the parent concerned, a deceased person will have 
no opportunity to contest a claim of filiation.
 In 
truth, it is 
the mother and in some cases, the father, who witnesses the actual birth
 of their children. Descendants normally only come to know of their 
parents through nurture and family lore. When they are born, they do not
 have the consciousness required to be able to claim personal knowledge 
of their parents. It thus makes sense for the parents to be present when
 evidence under the second paragraph of Article 172 is 
presented.

 The limitation that an action to prove filiation as an illegitimate 
child be brought within the lifetime of an alleged parent acknowledges 
that there may be other persons whose rights should be protected from 
spurious claims. This includes other children, legitimate and 
illegitimate, whose statuses are supported by strong evidence of a 
categorical nature.
 Respondent Pizarro has submitted 
petitioners'
 certificates of live birth to further disprove petitioners' filiation 
with Josefa. A Certificate of Live Birth issued in Paniqui, Tarlac on 
July 19, 1950 shows that Garcia's parents are Pedro Garcia and Carmen 
Bugarin
[69]
 while 
another 
Certificate of Live Birth issued in petitioner Ara's birthplace, Bauang,
 La Union, shows that he is the son of spouses Jose Ara and Maria 
Flores.
[70]
 The Court of Appeals gave 
credence to these birth certificates submitted by respondent Pizarro:
  


 The trustworthiness of public documents and the value 
given to 
the entries made therein could be grounded on 1) the sense of official 
duty in the preparation of the statement made, 2) the penalty which is 
usually affixed to a breach of that duty, 3) the routine and 
disinterested origin of most such statements, and 4) the publicity of 
record which makes more likely the prior exposure of such errors as 
might have occurred.


 Therefore, this Court upholds the birth certificates of 
William 
Garcia and Romeo F. Ara, as issued by the Civil Registry, in line with 

Legaspi v. Court of Appeals
,
 where the High Court ruled that the evidentiary nature of public 
documents must be sustained in the absence of strong, complete and 
conclusive proof of its falsity or nullity. Consequently, appellants 
Romeo F. Ara and William Garcia are deemed not to be the illegitimate 
sons of the late Josefa Ara.
[71]




 Thus, the Court of Appeals made a determination on the 
evidence 
and found that the birth certificates submitted by respondent Pizarro 
belong to petitioners Garcia and Ara. These birth certificates name 
Carmen Bugarin
[72]

 and Maria Flores,
[73]

 as the respective mothers of petitioners Garcia and Ara. Considering 
that these birth certificates do not name Josefa as a parent of either 
petitioner, petitioners are properly determined not to be Josefa's 
children.
 Petitioners point out that the Certificate 
of Birth 
does not contain petitioner Garcia's correct birth date. They claim that
 the birth date of petitioner Garcia as recorded in his baptismal 
certificate is June 23, 1951. This birth date is also reflected on his 
Certificate of Live Birth issued by the Municipal Civil Registrar of 
Paniqui, Tarlac, as well as in the Notice of Hearing of the delayed 
registration of birth certificate of petitioner Garcia. Thus, 
petitioners speculate that the birth certificate submitted by respondent
 Pizarro is of a different "William Garcia":
  


 Perhaps, defendant-appellant Fely Pizarro obtained a 
Certificate
 of Live Birth and Cedula de Baotismo of a wrong person bearing the same
 name William Garcia which always happened (sic) in our country 
considering that the family name Garcia is very much common because in 
the said documents the birthdate of a certain William Garcia was June 
23, 1950 not June 23, 1951, the actual birth of William Garcia.
[74]




 On this point, respondent Pizarro argues:
  


 It may be noted that William Garcia obtained said 
Certificate 
more than six (6) months after he, with his co-plaintiffs, had filed the
 case of judicial partition on 9 April 2003. Obviously, he found the 
need to apply for the late registration of his birth when he learned 
from respondent's Answer that from her knowledge she is the only child 
of Josefa Ara. Very likely, William Garcia already knew that he already 
has a record of birth in the municipality of Paniqui, Tarlac, showing 
that her mother was not Josefa Ara.
[75]




 These are matters of appreciation of evidence, however, 
which 
cannot be subject of inquiry in a petition for review under Rule 45. 
Nonetheless, considering that there were two reports of birth for 
William Garcia, and considering further that one of the reports was made
 only
 after 
initiating a case which would directly 
use said 
report, we cannot find error in the Court of Appeals' decision to 
disregard the delayed registration.
  
 Finally, petitioners' claim that there was no 
basis for the 
Court of Appeals to find that respondents are the children of Josefa is 
untenable. Respondents' filiation with Josefa was not put in question 
before the Trial Court. Even petitioners admitted in their Complaint 
that respondents were Josefa's children.
[76]

 Further, on appeal, no party questioned the Trial Court's determination
 that respondents Pizarro and Rossi were the children of Josefa. 
Consequently, the Court of Appeals did not err in sustaining these 
findings without requiring further proof.
