CARPIO MORALES, J.:


On June 24, 1990, fifteen (15) armed men stormed the house of the spouses 
Manuel
 and AAA in barrio 
Casingsingan Norte, Amulung, Cagayan
.
Two days after the incident or on June 26, 1990, AAA executed a sworn statement charging Eriberto Batuelo, Elpidio Gangan, Roberto Salvador, Martin Soriano and Roberto Balacanao of robbery with rape, along with five other persons.
The following day, June 27, 1990, 
Manuel
 also executed a sworn statement particularly identifying Soriano as one of the reprobates.
Thereafter or on July 2, 1990, a criminal complaint for robbery with multiple rapes
[1]
 was filed by Police Investigator Cuntapay against Balacanao, Batuelo, Gangan, Salvador, Soriano and five John Does.
After a preliminary examination conducted by Judge Rafael P. Carag of the Fifth Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Iguig, Cagayan, an appropriate information was recommended to be filed on August 22, 1990.
The station commander of the 
Amulung
 Police Station later received an anonymous letter
[2]
 dated â10-22-90â divulging that a certain Damaso Cabana was one of the âarchitectsâ of the June 24, 1990 incident.
Cabana was thus taken into police custody on November 5, 1990 following which he executed a sworn statement
[3]
 dated November 6, 1990 admitting his participation in the incident and identifying his associates as Jessie Acorda, Minio Acorda, Ruben Acorda, Tacio Acorda, Villamor Agana, Amoy Balacanao, Elvis Bangayan, Abraham Camayang, Ensu Caronan, Gil Tambiao, and four (4) other unnamed persons who turned out later to be Batuelo, Gangan, Salvador and Soriano. A reinvestigation of the case was thus conducted.
After the reinvestigation, Cabana and the fourteen he implicated were charged, by Information
[4]
 dated August 29, 1991, before the Regional Trial Court Branch 1 of Tuguegarao, Cagayan for Robbery with Rape allegedly committed as follows:
 That on or about June 24, 1990, in the municipality of 
Amulung
, Province of 
Cagayan
, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with guns, conspiring together and helping one another with intent to gain and by the use of force, violence and intimidation of persons entered the house of the complainant[s], Mr. and Mrs. 
Manuel A. Calata
, and once inside the house did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away against the will of the owner, the following items: 
 
 
One (1) Karaoke sing-along valued at 
 
P4,500.00
 
 
 
One (1) Wall clock valued at 
 
300.00
 
 
 
Assorted jewelries all valued at 
 
3,000.00
 
 
 
Assorted merchandize all valued at 
 
2,500.00
 
 
 
One (1) Samurai valued at 
 
550.00
 
 
 
Cash money in the amount of
 
 
300.00
 
 
 
PNB and LAND BANK Bank Books, a
 wallet containing pertinent papers, assorted
 keys and other items 
 
ââââââââ
 
 
 
TOTAL VALUE 
 
P11,150.00
 
 
all valued at P 11,150.00 and all belonging to the complainant[s] Mr. and Mrs. 
Manuel A. Calata
, to the damage and prejudice of the aforesaid owner[s] Mr. and Mrs. 
Manuel A. Calata
 in the aforesaid amount of ELEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY (P11,150.00) PESOS, Philippine Currency; that on the same occasion of the robbery, the above-named accused likewise armed with their aforesaid firearms, with lewd designs and by the use of force, violence against and intimidation of persons did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse one after the other with the offended party, AAA against her will.
Contrary to law.
Five of those charged, namely: Jessie Acorda, Herminio Acorda, Villamor Agana, Elvis Bangayan and Gil Tambiao, eluded arrest.
Balacanao, Caronan, Batuelo, Camayang, Gangan, Salvador, Soriano and Tacio Acorda pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.
On motion of the prosecution, Damaso Cabana was discharged to become a state witness.
From its evidence, the prosecution established the following version:
Between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. of June 24, 1990, Abraham Camayang, leader of a group of notorious characters from Solana, Cagayan (Solana group), and his henchman Villamor Agana went to the house of state witness Cabana in Casingsingan Norte, Solana, Cagayan and invited Cabana to join them for an unspecified purpose. Acceding, Cabana joined the two who were later joined by seven Solana group members, namely: Gil Tambiao, Elvis Bangayan, Lorenzo Caronan, Jessie Acorda, Herminio Acorda, Tacio Acorda and Ruben Acorda.
The Solana group, along with Cabana, then repaired to the house of the spouses 
Calata
 where another group of notorious characters from Amulung, Cagayan (Amulung group) composed of its leader Roberto Balacanao, Elpidio Gangan, Martin Soriano, Eriberto Batuelo and Roberto Salvador were already waiting in the vicinity.
Solana group leader Camayang thereupon gave directions to the two groups, he posting Cabana, Hermino Acorda and Tacio Acorda as look outs along the road south of the 
Calata
 house. Camayang, with four others, then entered the backdoor into the kitchen of the 
Calata
 house, catching by surprise AAA and her minor children 11 years old 
Claudette
 and 
Carlos
 who screamed. AAAâs husband 
Manuel
, who was in the sala, immediately dashed into the kitchen where he was met by Balacanao who pushed him back into the sala and made him lie face down. His hands were at once tied behind his back.
The second wave of malefactors soon entered the same backdoor of the 
Calata
 house, after which Camayang and Batuelo held AAA and her two young children at bay. They then demanded money from the 
Calatas
. In particular, Soriano made it appear that they are subversives who needed money for the treatment of their comrade who was injured in an encounter.
In the meantime, the 
Calatas
â neighbors Concepcion Lumboy, Celso Gorospe and Renato Corpuz passed by chance by the 
Calata
 house. Attracted by the noise and commotion inside the house, they proceeded thereto and once inside, they were pounced upon and shoved into the sala where they were ordered to lie flat in a prone position. Their hands were tied too behind their backs.
Caronan, to further instill terror, ordered one of his men to get a can of gasoline and when a can of gasoline was brought, he told his cohorts to pour gasoline on the victims and burn them.
As the crime wore on, Camayang dragged AAA and her daughter 
Claudette
 into a room beside the sala, the entrance of which room was covered only by a curtain. Once inside the room, Camayang tore off the clothes of AAA and 
Claudette
. As 
Claudette
 was crying, Camayang and his companions spared her and the naked girl immediately ran to her bound father in the sala. AAA was then raped by Camayang, followed by Tacio Acorda, then by Caronan, and finally by Balacanao.
The bound hands of 
Manuel
 and his three neighbors were later untied by the malefactors and they were ordered to remove their clothes. Caronan thereupon ordered Celso Gorospe to dance naked amidst the rhythmic clappings and jeers of the malefactors. The four were later ordered to put on their clothes but they were again tied and ordered to lie flat on the floor.
Herminio Acorda later shouted âget out now, people are coming,â prompting the malefactors to hurriedly flee with their loot consisting of cash, pieces of jewelry, assorted goods, appliances, a samurai sword, bank books, a wallet, keys, a wall clock and other items all valued at about P11,150.00. Thus, when the people referred to by Herminio Acorda - a group of thirty men from the adjacent barangay of Calintaan headed by their barangay captain Cesar Lacuesta - arrived at the 
Calata
 house, the malefactors were gone.
On June 26, 1990, upon instruction of the police, AAA submitted herself to a medical examination. Dr. Dulce Baculi, the Municipal Health Officer of Amulung, came out with her findings embodied in her Certification (Exhibit âEâ)
[5]
 which reads:
 âI. External Examination: 
 
 
1. Contusion at left jaw.
2. Slight swelling of upper lip.
 
 
No other external physical injuries noted on the victim. 
 âII. Internal Examination: 
 
Vulva on internal examination shows slight tenderness and smeared with blood. 
 Note: Victim is having her menstrual period.â
For the defense, all the accused, disclaiming being acquainted with state witness Damaso Cabana on or before the incident, proffered alibi.
After trial, the trial court found the accused Balacanao, Caronan, Batuelo, Camayang, Gangan, Salvador, Soriano, Ruben L. Acorda and Tacio B. Acorda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Robbery with Rape, by Decision of May 3, 1994 the dispositive portion of which reads:
 WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Roberto Balacanao y Quines, Roberto Salvador y Agcaoili, Martin Soriano y Narag, Eriberto Batuelo y Balacanao, Elpidio Gangan y Balisi, Abraham Camayang y Pagulayan, Lorenzo Caronan y Canapi, Tacio Acorda y Bisalde and Ruben Acorda y Layugan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape 
aggravated by abuse of superior strength and ignominy
 and hereby imposes upon each and everyone of them the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with all the accessory penalties provided for by law and to pay 
in solidum
 
Manuel
 and AAA the stolen properties in the amount of P11,150.00 and moral damages in the amount of P500,000.00 and cost.
SO ORDERED. (emphasis supplied)
The Decision has, with respect to 
Balacanao
 who did not appeal, become final and executory.
Caronan and Camayang jointly filed a notice of appeal on May 12, 1994. 
Caronan
, however, later filed an undated letter, which this Court treated as a Motion, praying for the withdrawal
[6]
 of his appeal in view of the extension to him of executive clemency. This Court granted said Motion and accordingly dismissed the case against Caronan by a Resolution of April 7, 1999.
[7]
Salvador, Gangan, Soriano, Batuelo and Ruben Acorda (Salvador 
et al.
) also jointly filed a notice of appeal while Tacio Acorda and Camayang separately filed theirs.
Accused-appellant Tacio Acorda assigned as lone error of the trial court its finding that he is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Accused-appellant Camayang challenges the trial court for having erred:
 
IN BASING ITS DECISION OF CONVICTION OF APPELLANT (CAMAYANG) SOLELY ON THE CONFESSIONAL TESTIMONY OF DAMASO CABANS [sic] PARTICULARY IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF ACCUSED ABRAHAM CAMAYANG AS ONE OF THE CULPRITS;
IN NOT BELIEVING THE COUNTER-AFFIDAVIT OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT ABRAHAM AS CORROBORATED BY WITNESSES;
IN RELYING ON THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION INSTEAD OF WEIGHING THE EVIDENCES ADDUCED DURING THE TRIAL, THERE BEING ABSENT THE INTENT OF ACCUSED ABRAHAM CAMAYANGâS PARTICIPATION (sic) IN THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE; and
IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT ABRAHAM CAMAYANG WHO AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED OFFENSE WAS COMMITTED WAS NOT AT THE SCENE [OF THE CRIME AND WAS] MERELY IMPLICATED BY [CABANA DUE TO] INTIMIDATION AND COERCION DURING THE CUSTODIAL INVESTIGATION.
And as to accused-appellants Salvador, 
et al.
, they fault the trial court in:
 
. . . FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS ROBERTO A. SALVADOR, ELPIDIO GANGAN, MARTIN N. SORIANO, ERIBERTO B. BATUELO AND RUBEN L. ACORDA GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE COMPLEX CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH RAPE.
. . . ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT ROBERTO A. SALVADOR, ELPIDIO GANGAN, MARTIN N. SORIANO, ERIBERTO B. BATUELO AND RUBEN L. ACORDA TO PAY 
IN SOLIDUM
 THE SPOUSES 
MANUEL
 AND AAA, THE AMOUNT OF P11,150.00 REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT OF THE STOLEN PROPERTY AND MORAL DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF P500,000.00 AND COST.
Accused-appellantsâ respective appeals lack merit.
Robbery with rape is a special complex crime
[8]
 punished under the second paragraph of Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code which reads:
 ART. 294. 
Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons- Penalties.
- Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:
xxx 
The penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
, when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation, or if by reason or on occasion of such robbery, any of the physical injuries penalized in subdivision 1 of Article 263 shall have been inflicted: 
Provided, however,
 That when the robbery accompanied with rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death; (As amended by P.D. No. 767, August 15, 1975)
xxx
That the crime was committed is undisputed. The issue in the main is the 
identity
 of the malefactors.
Accused-appellants contend that the prosecution failed to establish their identity as participants in the crime, hence, it was error for the trial court not to have appreciated their alibi.
Accused-appellantsâ contention does not persuade.
From the following extracts of the testimony of state witness Cabana, and his identification
[9]
 in court of accused-appellants, there can be no mistaking their participation in the crime:

The same, they are at the back of my wife and my two children, sir.
[22]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
xxx
 
 
And 
Manuel
 and AAA identified in court five of the seven accused-appellants, with AAA positively identifying accused-appellants Soriano, Gangan and Batuelo
[23]
 while 
Manuel
 identified accused-appellants Camayang, Salvador and Soriano.
[24]
In another vein, accused-appellants assail the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, particularly drawing attention to Cabanaâs statement that there were five who sexually abused AAA which contradicts the latterâs testimony that there were four, thus rendering his testimony unworthy of belief.
[25]
 Accused-appellant Tacio Acorda adds that Cabana was just used by Police Investigator Rodrigo Cuntapay to entangle him in this case.
Accused-appellants also capitalize on the failure of AAA to correctly identify her sexual abusers 
during the preliminary investigation
.
[26]
Accused-appellantsâ assault at the credibility of the prosecution witnesses fails.
Cabanaâs failure to point out the exact number of AAAâs sexual tormentors is of no consequence, accused-appellants themselves having noted
[27]
 that the testimony of Cabana as regards this point is hearsay and inadmissible.
With respect to the claim that Cabana was merely used by Police Investigator Cuntapay to implicate accused-appellant Tacio Acorda in the crime, the same finds no support from the records and cannot accordingly defeat the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed.
[28]
As for the questioned identification by AAA during the preliminary investigation of her sexual abusers, this did not escape the attention of the trial court when it noted as follows:
[29]
 
AAA testified that the men whom she identified in court were the real rapists
. She explained that she 
committed the error during the previous identification
 (preliminary investigation) 
due to nervousness
 and confusion on the names of the rapists in their number and in the order or sequence of the sexual assaults upon her. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).
xxx
But AAAâs explanation behind her error in the identification of her rapists during the preliminary investigation merited the understanding and credence by the trial court in this wise:
 AAA suffered what very few women in this world had gone through. She underwent a most traumatic and nerve-shocking ordeal - a hideous, ghastly and outrageous blow upon her feminine possession. 
To expect her to narrate in court
 and in public her most horrible and excruciating experience in a 
perfect sequence of events and accurate identification
  of the reprobates whom, in the first place, she did not personally know, 
is to be unreasonable
....
[30]
 (Underscoring supplied).
xxx
Indeed, AAAâs confusion should not militate against her given the number of malefactors and the ordeal she went through. What counts is that she was firm at the witness stand that her rapists, and the order in which they raped her, were what she mentioned thereat. Thus, on direct examination, she declared:
 
 
 
(Fiscal Saquing)

Why would AAA, a married woman and mother of four,
[32]
 raped successively by four men on one occasion, devise a sick narrative and expose herself to the unbearable stigma and humiliation attendant to a trial for rape if she were not determined to punish her malefactors?
In any event, AAAâs incorrect identification during the preliminary investigation of her sexual abusers is inconsequential with respect to the criminal liability of accused-appellants. For at the trial court and during the preliminary investigation, she identified Balacanao as one of those who sexually abused her. As conspiracy was proven and rape was committed 
as a consequence, or on the occasion
 of the robbery, all the conspirators-participants are liable as principals of the crime of robbery with rape.
[33]
As for the brushing aside of accused-appellantsâ alibis since they failed to prove that it was 
physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime
[34]
 on the date and time it occurred, the trial court did not err thereby.
Thus, accused-appellant Tacio Acorda merely claimed that he was at the time in 
Barangay Santiago, Municipality of Iguig the same province of Cagayan.
Accused-appellants Gangan, Salvador and Sorianoâs evidence claimed that they were all in the 
same municipality of Amulung
 at about the time the crime was perpetrated. But accused-appellant Ganganâs alibi is uncorroborated. And so is accused-appellant Salvadorâs that he was at the house of Arsenio Agcaoili in Anquiray, Amulung.
[35]
 In fact, accused-appellant Salvadorâs testimony on other points is mired in inconsistencies. Thus he first testified that he slept at the house of Agcaoli in Anquiray because 
he (Salvador) had visitors
 at home that night.
[36]
  He later retracted and said they were 
visitors of his brother
.
[37]
 And while he initially stated that his brother told him not to go or leave their house because they had visitors, he later said that it was presumably the same brother who told him to leave.
[38]
 As for accused-appellant Soriano, he gave inconsistent statements with regard the 
date
 he was allegedly assigned to act as guard at the dancehall in Pacac Grande, Amulung, he initially stating that it was on June 25, 1990, but he later claiming that it was on June 24, 1990.
In accused-appellant Camayangâs case, while he and accused Caronan testified that they were at Pudtol, Kalinga-Apayao at about the time the offense was committed, at work in the construction of presumably the same hospital, they surprisingly failed to state that they saw each other on that day.
As for the other arguments of accused-appellants, they are bereft of merit.
Accused-appellant Camayangâs claim that the trial court laid undue stress on the sworn statement of Cabana
[39]
 and that his guilt cannot be predicated thereon is belied by the trial courtâs disquisition which shows that Cabanaâs sworn statement was only one of the documentary bases for its decision.
The argument that Cabanaâs testimony was given under the compulsion of irresistible force and insuperable fear
[40]
 is purely speculative.
As for the argument that since Cabana is an unschooled farmer, the question-and-answer method of eliciting testimony cannot become the basis for accused-appellant Camayangâs conviction
[41]
 deserves scant consideration.
Accused-appellant Tacio Acordaâs contention that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt because his name was never mentioned by the spouses 
Calata
 during the preliminary investigation
[42]
 fails. He was identified by Cabana during the reinvestigation. More importantly, he was positively identified by Cabana and the spouses 
Calata
 during the trial.
The lack of merit of the appeal notwithstanding, it being settled that an appeal throws the entire criminal case open for review, it becomes the duty of appellate courts to correct errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from, whether they are made the subject of assignment of errors or not.
[43]
In the present case, the appreciation by the trial court of the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and ignominy is erroneous. The 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that every complaint or information should state not only the qualifying but also the aggravating circumstances.
[44]
 This provision may be given retroactive effect in light of the well-settled rule that âstatutes regulating the 
procedure
 of the court will be construed as applicable to actions 
pending
 and 
undetermined
 at the time of their passage, [hence] [p]rocedural laws are retroactive in that sense and to that extent.â
[45]
 The aggravating circumstance âthat advantage be taken of superior strengthâ and ignominy not having been alleged in the information in this case, the same could not be appreciated.
With respect to the award of P11,150.00 to the spouses 
Calata
 as actual damages for the claimed stolen personal properties: Ordinary witnesses such as private complainants cannot establish the value of jewelry.
[46]
 Neither can the same be taken judicial notice of.
[47]
 The valuations made by 
Manuel
 and AAA cannot thus become the basis for reparation in the absence of receipts or any other competent evidence.
Neither can reparation for the Karaoke sing-along appliance be ordered, absent proof as to its description, kind/model and competent evidence of its value.
[48]
 The same holds true with respect to the assorted merchandise, the samurai, the wallet, the PNB and Land Bank bankbooks and assorted keys. The wall clock having been admittedly recovered,
[49]
 only the amount of P10,000.00 cash stolen
[50]
 established by the prosecution which, though not the amount alleged in the information, was not objected to and rebutted by the defense,
[51]
 should be awarded.
It was also error for the trial court to award P500,000.00 as moral damages without citing the basis therefor. AAA is thus entitled to only an award of P50,000.00 for each count of rape as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 for each count as moral damages.
[52]
 Furthermore, an award to 
Manuel
 of P50,000.00 as moral damages is in order.
WHEREFORE, the May 3, 1994 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan, Branch 1 at Tuguegarao, finding accused-appellants Roberto A. Salvador, Elpidio B. Gangan, Martin N. Soriano, Eriberto B. Batuelo, Abraham P. Camayang, Ruben L. Acorda and Tacio B. Acorda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape and sentencing them to each suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
. They are ordered to pay jointly and severally the amount of P10,000.00 to private complainants 
Manuel Calata
 and AAA as actual damages; the amount of P50,000.00 to AAA for each count of rape as civil indemnity, and another P50,000.00 for each count as moral damages; and the amount of P50,000.00 to 
Manuel Calata
 as moral damages.
SO ORDERED.

 The elements of robbery are: (1) the subject is personal property belonging to another; (2) there is unlawful taking of that property; (3) the taking is with the intent to gain; and (4) there is violence against or intimidation of any person or use of force upon things (
People v. Tano
, 331 SCRA 449, 466 [2000]). Rape, on the other hand, is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following instances: (1) force or intimidation is used, (2) the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (3) she is under twelve years of age (
People v. Tano
, 331 SCRA 449, 464 [2000]). The special complex crime of robbery with rape is committed when the robbery is accompanied by rape.
