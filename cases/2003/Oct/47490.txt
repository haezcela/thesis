PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. JAIME OLAYBAR Y ODTUHAN, APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


Republic Act No. 8385, otherwise also known as the Anti-Rape Act of 1997, has incorporated a new chapter in the Revised Penal Code.  In a new provision, designated Article 266-A, the crime of rape is committed either by 
sexual intercourse
 or by 
sexual assault.  
Rape by sexual intercourse, pursuant to the first paragraph of the article, is committed by a 
man 
who shall have carnal knowledge of a 
woman 
under any of the following circumstances; 
viz
: 
 
 
(a)
 
 
Through force, threat, or intimidation; 
 
 
 
(b)
 
 
When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
 
 
 
(c)
 
 
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
 
 
 
(d) 
 
When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
 
 
The last of the enumeration, item (d) above, constitutes what is so often referred to as statutory rape.  Rape by sexual assault, mentioned in the second paragraph of the same article, is committed by 
any person 
who, under any of the aforestated circumstances, inserts his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person.
Appellant Jaime Olaybar y Odtuhan, a.k.a. Jimmy, was charged with two counts of rape, the first for statutory rape under the first paragraph of Article 266-A and the second for rape by means of sexual assault under the second paragraph of the article, in separate informations that read:
Criminal Case No. 00-1600
"That on or about the 5
th
 day of September, 2000, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, JAIME OLAYBAR y ODTUHAN, by means of force and intimidation did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant, AAA, a minor, eight (8) years of age, against her will and consent."
[1]
Criminal Case No. 00-1601
"That on or about the 6
th
 day of September 2000, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, JAIME OLAYBAR Y ODTUHAN, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of sexual assault by inserting his penis into the anus of complainant, AAA, a minor, eight (8) years of age, against the latter's will and by means of force and intimidation."
[2]
Olaybar entered a plea of "not guilty" to both charges; the cases were consolidated and tried jointly with the prosecution and the defense, in that order, presenting their respective versions of the case.
AAA, an eight-year old child, lives with her family at 
2297 F.B. Harrison Street, Pasay City
, in a squatter's area close to a parking lot opposite the Meralco office. On 05 September 2000, around seven o'clock in the evening, AAA was playing with her friends when Olaybar brought her to a parked jeepney in the nearby parking lot.  Inside the jeepney, Olaybar made AAA lie down and had his penis inserted into her vagina.  After a while, Olaybar made her sit on his lap and put his penis inside her anus. That night, when brought home by Olaybar, AAA told her mother, 
Rea
, that Olaybar molested her.  
Rea
 confronted Olaybar but the latter denied having done anything to AAA.  
Rea
 warned Olaybar never to come near AAA again.  The following evening, on 06 September 2000, between seven o'clock and seven-thirty, Olaybar called AAA and, despite the warning made the previous night, he again brought her to a parked jeepney, made her sit on his lap and inserted his penis into her anus.  He then escorted her home. AAA, just as before, told her mother of what had transpired. 
Rea
 confronted Olaybar but the latter once more denied any wrongdoing. 
Rea
 sought the help of one Roger Siobert and, this time, Olaybar admitted to Roger what he had done.  
Rea
 went to the police to report the incident.
When brought to the hospital on 07 September 2000, AAA was examined by Dr. Merle P. Tan of the Child Protection Unit of the UP-PGH.  The genital and anal examination disclosed the following findings:

Olaybar had nothing to offer but 
alibi
 for his defense
.
  He claimed that on the evening of 05 September 2000, around seven o'clock, he was at home, and the following night, on 06 September 2000, at or about the time the second incident was said to have taken place, he was outside the parking lot ("
nasa labasan"
).  The complaint, according to him, was filed against him only because AAA's family disliked the idea of people parking their vehicles in the vicinity.
Convinced of the strength of the evidence submitted by the prosecution and the utter weakness of the case for the defense, the trial court convicted appellant Olaybar of the crimes for which he was indicted; the court 
a quo 
adjudged:
"WHEREFORE in Criminal Case No. 00-1600, accused Jaime Olaybar y Odtuhan is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Death and to pay the victim civil indemnity of P75,000.00 and P50,000.00 moral damages.
"Likewise, in Criminal Case No. 00-1601, accused Jaime Olaybar y Odtuhan is hereby sentence to suffer the penalty of Death and to pay the victim civil indemnity of P75,000.00 and P50,000.00 moral damages.
"It would appear from the testimony of the complainant, AAA that on September 5, 2000, aside from having carnal knowledge of the victim, accused Jaime Olaybar also inserted his finger in her vagina and also inserted his penis into her anus.  In view thereof, the City Prosecutor is hereby ordered to conduct an investigation on the liability of the accused for Sec. 10 (a), Art. VI of RA 7610 and Rape, in so far as the above revelation of the complainant which were not alleged in Criminal Case No. 00-1600."
[4]
With the imposition below of the penalty of death, the records were elevated to this Court for review. Challenging the decision of the trial court, appellant would aver that -
 
 
"I. 
 
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF RAPE WHEN THE LATTER'S GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
 
 
 
 
"II. 
 
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF ANY QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE INFORMATIONS."
[5]
 
 
While the Office of the Solicitor General argues that no cogent reasons exist to overturn the conviction of appellant, it does agree with the latter, however, that in neither of the two cases, could the penalty of death be aptly imposed.
Like the trial court, which has had an opportunity to observe closely the witnesses in giving their testimony before it, this Court, in its own assessment, also finds the child-victim to be credible; her testimony is sufficiently clear, quite categorical and definitely straightforward.  Recalling her ordeal before the trial court, AAA has testified:
 
 
"FISCAL BARRERA:

The testimony of AAA was corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Merle P. Tan, who found that there was swelling of the victim's 
labia majoris 
and 
minoris clitoris
, the urethra and periurethral area, the perihymenal area, the whole hymen and the perineal area.  The second assault was likewise confirmed by the anal examination which showed swelling perianal skin and laceration of anal folds and rugae at "5 and 7 o'clock positions."
[7]
 Dr. Tan, confirming her findings in open court, declared:
 
 
 
"Q
 
 
So, after the said mother 
Rea Into
 as well as the patient gave their consent for medico genital examination and anal examination, what step did you take? 
 
 
 
"A

"Q 
 
What did you gather from your interview?
 
 
 
"A
 
 
During the interview she said, `Si Jimmy pinasok ang titi sa puwet ko.' Then I asked her how many times, she said in her finger `dalawa.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q
 
 
After the said interview, what did you do?
 
 
 
"A
 
 
After that we subjected the patient to medico genital and anal examinations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q 
 
What was the result of your medico genital examination?
 
 
 
"A

"A:
 
 
The result of gram stain `positive for intracellular diplococci.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q: 
 
What do you mean by that in your finding?
 
 
 
"A: 
 
That there is a bacteria inside that stain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q:
 
 
What would be the cause of bacteria?

"Q:

"Q: 
 
Doctor, a perusal of the complaint of AAA, would reveal that she was complaining she was sexually abused by the herein accused Jaime Olaybar by [inserting] his penis [into] her vagina and inserted his finger insider her vagina also and inserted his penis inside the anus, would your finding regarding the said medico genital examination as well as the anal examination as contained in Exhs. C and D would be compatible in your finding?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Atty. Casas:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We object to the question because as the summary of the interview as stated in the medical certificate.

"Fiscal Barrera:

I'm confronting you with your finding, there was an examination on the hymen as well as the anus?
 
 
 
"A:
 
 
Yes, sir. There was penetration that has been done to the child, specifically the child acquired sexually transmitted disease that can be gathered such as an act.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q: 
 
What an act, is it compatible with the complaint of the child?
 
 
 
"A: 
 
There is a penetration done and according to the laboratory examination the patient has acquired sexually transmitted disease. This can be done by sexual act.

"A:
 
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Q:

Mere denial without any strong evidence to support it, can scarcely overcome the positive declaration by the child-victim of the identity and involvement of appellant in the crimes attributed to him.  The defense of 
alibi
 is likewise unavailing.  It is not enough, in order that 
alibi
 might prosper, to prove that the accused has been somewhere else during the commission of the crime; it must also be shown that it would have been impossible for him to be anywhere within the vicinity of the crime scene.
[9]
 In this case, appellant himself has admitted being just around the neighborhood at the time.
Anent the often-invoked claim that that it would have been impossible for appellant to bring and molest the victim to the jeepney in a public place and in the presence of many people, the Court would not need to belabor further that rape has been known to be committed not only in seclusion but also in places where people congregate, such as in a park, along the roadside, within school premises, inside an occupied house or even in a room where there are other people around.
[10]
Finally, the Court finds it much too flimsy and scarcely with any sense for appellant to contend that the charges against him have been filed on account simply of AAA's family being resentful of vehicles being allowed to park nearby their area.
The trial court has decreed the penalty of death on account of circumstance numbered 6 of Article 266-A, 
i.e.,
 that when "the offender knows that he is afflicted with Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV), Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or any other sexually transmissible disease and the virus or disease is transmitted to the victim," the imposition of the extreme penalty of death would be warranted. While it is established that AAA, indeed, has contracted a sexually transmitted-disease, no evidence, however, has been adduced to show the latter's being aware of his own affliction with such a disease.  In fact, that aggravating circumstance is not even alleged in the two Informations.
In Criminal Case No. 00-1600, the penalty imposed upon appellant for the offense of statutory rape, absent any aggravating circumstance that can be considered, must, accordingly, be reduced to 
reclusion perpetua.
  In Criminal Case No. 00-1601, the penalty for the offense of rape by sexual assault, conformably with Article 266-B of the Code, is 
prision mayor 
or one degree lower than that imposed for rape by sexual intercourse.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and absent any modifying circumstance, the imposable penalty should then be anywhere from eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years of 
prision mayor 
medium, as maximum penalty, and anywhere within the range of from six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years of 
prision correccional,
 as minimum penalty, for the offense.
In line with prevailing jurisprudence, the victim, in a case for simple statutory rape by sexual intercourse, is entitled to P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages. For being likewise the victim of rape by sexual assault, she is additionally entitled to an award of P30,000.00 civil indemnity and P30,000.00 moral damages.
WHEREFORE
, this Court, finding appellant Jaime Olaybar y Odtuhan guilty, on two counts, of rape, hereby sentences him to suffer, in Criminal Case No. 00-1600, the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 for rape by sexual intercourse and, in Criminal Case No. 00-1601, the penalty of imprisonment from four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision correccional
, as minimum penalty, to nine (9) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor,
 as maximum penalty, for rape by sexual assault.  Appellant is likewise ordered to pay AAA civil indemnity of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos and moral damages of  Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos for the offense of statutory rape by sexual intercourse and another civil indemnity of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos and moral damages of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos for the crime of rape by sexual assault.
