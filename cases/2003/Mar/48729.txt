PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. SATURNINO ILUIS Y JANDOC, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


In Criminal Case No. V-0786, the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan, Branch 50, found Saturnino Iluis y Jandoc @ âMasongâ guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape âdefined and penalized under Item No. 4 of the last paragraph of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended,â and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of death, as well as to pay civil indemnity of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) to the victim, AAA, for the crime.
The Information that AAA, assisted by her grandmother, caused to be filed in court on 23 June 1998, read:
âThat sometimes [sic] between the months of August and October, 1997 at 
Poblacion Zone IV
, Municipality of 
Villasis
, Province of 
Pangasinan
, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one AAA being below twelve (12) years old, against the latterâs will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said AAA.
âContrary to Art. 335, in relation to R.A. No. 8353 of the Revised Penal Code.â
[1]
At his arraignment, Saturnino Iluis entered a plea of not guilty.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution, upon which the trial court based its finding of guilt, tended to show that -
AAA
[2]
 was born on 23 September 1991 in Siniloan, Laguna,
[3]
 to a single parent, 
Julieta Calaunan Mutia
, who, unfortunately, would not live long enough to see her daughter pass through her formative years. AAA was barely four years old when her mother died. She was left to the care of 
Maritess Raguindin
, 
Julieta
âs sister, who had several children of her own. Ultimately, 
Maritess
 gave the child to 
Ana Abriam
 for âadoption.â 
Maritess
 gave 
Ana
 the birth certificate of AAA that she had taken from 
Julieta
âs wallet. With her husband Dominador Raguindin, 
Maritess
 executed a document in the dialect, dated 13 October 1993,
[4]
 to confirm that the couple had entrusted AAA to the custody of 
Ana
. Two days after giving the custody of AAA to 
Ana
, 
Maritess
 received from 
Ana
 dollars equivalent to P10,000 âas a sort of help.â 
Ana
 would also give some sums to 
Maritess
 whenever she would come around and visit AAA, also called Jing, at the 
Abriam
 residence.
Ana Abriam
, 71, named 
Rosita Abriam
 at birth, decided for reasons of her own to call herself 
Ana
 when she had started to become sickly. She turned American citizen in 1981. In October 1993, AAA became her 
taraken
 or âadoptedâ child. In school, AAA was thought to have been legally adopted and was made to use the surname 
Abriam
. Whenever 
Rosita
 would go to the United States, she would entrust AAA to the custody of Saturnino Iluis, his sister-in-law Teresita Iluis or Tessie and his mother Basilia, in 
Rosita
âs house at 
No. 80, San Geronimo Street, Zone IV, Poblacion, Villasis, Pangasinan
.
In August 1997, 
Rosita
 left for the United States; she returned on 18 November 1997. A few days later, on the early evening of 21 November 1997, 
Rosita
 was viewing a television show with AAA when the latter held 
Rosita
 and meaningfully pressed the middle of 
Rosita
âs palm. Realizing that the gesture conveyed something that was ânot a nice act,â 
Rosita
 told AAA, âWhoever did that thing to you tell me his name because that man might kidnap and kill you.â When AAA refused to talk, 
Rosita
 âthreatenedâ AAA that she would not give the girl the things that had been bought for her. AAA uttered, âI am afraid, Grandma, but I will tell his name. He is Uncle Masong.â 
Rosita
 called Tessie and her nephew so that they could also hear what the child was saying. Once again when asked, AAA disclosed that Masong molested her. He would embrace, kiss, touch her private part, and then 
garawen
 her. When 
Rosita
 asked AAA what she meant by 
garawen
, AAA said that Masong would put his penis into her vagina.
Rosita
 decided to have AAA medically examined. Since it was a Friday, 
Rosita
 waited for Monday before she brought AAA to Dr. Hian Kiat Dy for examination. Not satisfied with the findings of Dr. Dy, 
Rosita
 brought AAA to the Don Amadeo J. Perez, Sr., Memorial General Hospital in Urdaneta, Pangasinan. Dr. Jeanna Nebril-Ramilo who examined AAA on 28 November 1997 made her findings thusly:
âExternal Genitalia: No abrasion, scar noted on pubic/escutchen.
- Labia Major â Labia Minor gaping, positive rounding fourchette
- Deep healed laceration 1:00 oâclock position hymen.
- Healed laceration 3:00 position
- Admits index finger midway with slight resistance.â
[5]
According to Dr. Nebril-Ramilo, these findings revealed the âpossibility of penetrationâ of the childâs sex organ by a blunt object.
[6]
On Monday, 24 November 1997, Jonathan Fernando-Manlongat, AAAâs kindergarten teacher at the St. Anthony Abbot Academy, noticed that it was 
Manang
 Tessie who accompanied AAA to school. When Jonathan asked 
Manang
 Tessie why AAA was absent the previous Friday, 
Manang
 Tessie replied that AAAâs grandmother had just arrived from America. When he inquired why it was she, not Masong, who accompanied AAA to school, 
Manang
 Tessie told Jonathan that Masong had been fired because âhe had done something wrong to the child.â Jonathan wanted to know what had happened but 
Manang
 Tessie told him to just speak to the child. At recess period, Jonathan asked AAA what her âuncleâ Masong did to her. At first, AAA just stared at Jonathan but, when Jonathan persisted, AAA reluctantly answered that Masong had molested her.
According to AAA herself, during the months of August to October 1997, Masong would let her smoke, take off her panty, and put his penis into her vagina. She would feel pain whenever Masong inserted his penis into her vagina but, fearful, she kept quiet about the matter. Eventually, however, AAA told her Grandma 
Ana
 about the molestations and that Masong did the acts of taking off her panty and putting his penis into her vagina three times in the 
kubo-kubo
 (nipa hut). Her grandma being then abroad, AAA would sleep with her aunt Tessie but it was Masong who would bring and fetch her to and from school.
The defense interposed denial. Saturnino Iluis (Masong), single, 42, reached only the 6th grade in the Elementary School and also answered to the nickname âMelchor.â He worked in the 
Abriam
 household from 1 April 1995 until 24 November 1997. His sister-in-law, Teresita, who was hired to work in the same household on 27 August 1997, was responsible for the laundry work and for looking after AAA. Saturnino treated AAA both as a sister and as his own child. He denied the accusation against him which he attributed to his having spent the household allowance of P5,850 for the dress and pictures of AAA when she became a beauty contest candidate in her school. He was sent home on 19 November 1997 after 
Rosita
 previously warned him, through Teresita, that should he be unable to pay that amount, she would file a rape case against him. He was at home in Amamperez when the police arrested him. Teresita Iluis sought to corroborate, in part, the testimony of her brother-in-law.
The defense also presented Dr. Hian Kiat C. Dy who was the first physician to examine AAA upon the request of Chief of Police Patricio Fantin PiÃ±ol. In the medical report, he inscribed the following findings:
â1. Redness â area between urethra opening and vaginal opening.
â2. Vaginal Opening â about 0.3 cm. in diameter
â3. Hymen â intact/no laceration
â4. Pain and tenderness of the vulva.â
[7]
The redness of the urethra could have been due, he said, to inflammation or infection, and an intact hymen implied that there was no laceration and that no foreign object had been inserted into the vagina. He admitted, however, that the redness between the urethra opening and the vaginal opening could have been caused by an erect penis coming into contact with the vaginal opening.
The trial court found Saturnino Iluis guilty of the crime of qualified rape for which it imposed upon him the death penalty; it concluded:
âWHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Saturnino Iluis y Jandoc @ `Masongâ guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Item No. 4 of the last paragraph of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is hereby accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of death.
âThe accused is further ordered to pay AAA the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as indemnification.â
[8]
In this automatic review, appellant would have it that â
â
I
.
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT SATURNINO ILUIS Y JANDOC BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF STATUTORY RAPE NOTWITHSTANDING THE WEAKNESS OF THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE.
â
II.
ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY BECAUSE THE TRUE AGE OF THE VICTIM, WHICH WAS 6 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE RAPE, WAS NOT ALLEGED IN THE INFORMATION NOR WAS IT DULY PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.â
[9]
The Court finds no sufficient basis for ignoring, let alone overturning, the factual assessment made by the court below. Once again, the Court must reiterate the familiar rule that the task of taking on the issue of credibility is a function properly lodged with the trial court and whose findings are entitled to great weight.
[10]
In this case, the trial court observed that AAA had remained consistent and demonstrated her credibility even with the extensive and rigorous cross-examination conducted by appellantâs counsel.
[11]
 In assailing the credibility of the victim, who was only seven years old when she testified on the sexual ordeal she had suffered a year before, appellant would stress on her failure to give details of the commission of the crime. That, however, would not exactly appear to be the case. The victim testified:

On cross-examination, AAA continued:
 
 
âATTY. BUMACOD: 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
From whom did you learn how to make that sign of pointing your left forefinger at the middle of the palm of your grandmother?

âA 
 
Long ago [sic], sir.â
[13]
 
 
The unflinching testimony of the child victim notwithstanding, appellant would insist that her statement that âhe (appellant) put his penis 
into
 my vaginaâ was inadequate to warrant conviction for the crime of rape. The trial court correctly brushed aside this argument. Granting that there was no complete penetration of the vagina, even just the briefest contact of the pudendum by the phallus, however, would be enough to consummate the crime of rape.
[14]
 In 
People vs. Balgos
,
[15]
 the six-year old victim testified that the penis of the appellant did not penetrate her vagina but only touched its âhole.â The Court considered that testimony as being sufficient and a âtell-tale signâ of the victimâs âhonesty and candor in relating her unsavory experience.â Considering her age, AAAâs failure to give the gory details on the sexual debasement would be understandable and typical of an innocent child whose virtue had unexpectedly been violated and her chastity abused.
[16]
 Ample margin of inaccuracies should be accorded to a child witness who obviously had been gripped with tension on the witness stand.
[17]
 Most significantly, no plausible reason was given by the defense why AAA would fabricate the charges.
Appellant claims that AAAâs behavior after the commission of the crime, i.e., in not missing school, can hardly be considered normal for one who has been raped. There is, the Court has repeatedly observed however, no standard form of behavior that can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly by a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. People react differently to emotional stress and rape victims are no different from them.
The defense attempts to blemish the medical report of Dr. Nebril-Ramilo by the findings of Dr. Dy but the latter himself, on cross-examination, did not rule out the possibility of âan erect penis coming into contactâ with the sex organ of the child that resulted in the redness of the area between the urethral and the vaginal openings.
[18]
 In any event, a medical examination is not essential in the prosecution of a rape case; a medical examination, as well as the medical certificate, is merely corroborative in character. Such a report is not an indispensable requirement for conviction for what matters greatly is the clear, unequivocal and credible
[19]
 testimony of the victim.
Appellant is correct, however, in submitting that the death penalty should not have been imposed. Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, provides:
âArticle 335. When and how rape is committed. â Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
âx x x x x x x x x.
â3. When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
âThe crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.
âx x x x x x x x x.
âThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
âx x x x x x x x x.
â4. when the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.â
While the age of the victim, i.e., of being barely six years old at the time of the rape, is supported by the Certificate of Live Birth (Exhibit âAâ), showing that AAA was born on 23 September 1991, and the testimony of 
Maritess Raguindin
 (the sister of AAAâs mother
[20]
), in order, however, to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, it is required that the qualifying circumstance of the rape victim being âbelow seven years of ageâ should be aptly alleged in the Information. The Court has made it explicit that qualifying circumstances, which would increase the penalty by a higher degree, âmust be properly pleaded in the information consistent with the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him.â
[21]
 Mindful, indeed, of the entitlement of an accused to this fundamental right, the Court has now provided for in Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, made effective on 1 December 2000, thusly:
âSEC. 8. Designation of the offense. â The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances. If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.
âSEC. 9. Cause of accusation. â The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment.â
The allegation in the Information that the victim is âbelow twelve (12) years old,â an age indication that would only call for the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, cannot suffice to warrant the imposition of the extreme penalty of death.
Pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, in addition to the civil indemnity of P50,000.00 awarded by the court 
a quo
, a like amount of P50,000.00 in moral damages must also be awarded to the rape victim.
WHEREFORE, the decision of the trial court insofar as it finds appellant Saturnino Iluis y Jandoc, a.k.a. Masong or Melchor, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in (a) that the penalty of death imposed is reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
 and (b) that, in addition to the civil indemnity of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) ordered to be paid by appellant, another amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) in moral damages is awarded to AAA. Costs
