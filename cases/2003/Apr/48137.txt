Before the Court for automatic review is the Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 59, of San Carlos City, Negros Occidental, in Criminal Case No. RTC-1735, finding appellant Johnny Viajedor guilty of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the death penalty.
The Information
[2]
 filed against appellant reads:
That, on or about the 14
th
 day of December, 1997, in the Municipality of 
Escalante
, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the herein offended party, AAA, after the latter was forced to drink âTubaâ by the former which weakened and deprived said offended party of her strength and resistance, with the use of force and/or intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the latter who was then 13 years old, without her consent and against her will, and to her damage and prejudice.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
When arraigned on March 2, 1999, appellant pleaded not guilty.
[3]
 Trial ensued.
The Prosecutionâs Evidence
Private complainant 
AAA
 (AAA) testified that on December 14, 1997, she was in their house in 
Balintawak, Escalante
, Negros Occidental, watching her younger brother and two sisters. At that time, she was 13 years old. Her mother left the house at 6:00 a.m. to sell clothes. In the morning of said date, her father was at work. Her father was working with the municipal government of 
Escalante
, Negros Occidental as a street cleaner of the public market.
[4]
AAA testified that her mother was not able to return to their house on December 14, 1997. Although her fatherâs dismissal time from work was at 5:00 p.m., on December 14, 1997 her father arrived home, drunk, at 4:00 p.m. He brought home one gallon of tuba. He made her and her younger brother and sisters drink the tuba. She drank three glasses of tuba and became weak. She asked permission from her father to sleep. Her father made her sit on his lap. He told her that she was already a big girl, as big as her mother. She replied, âYou have now a daughter who becomes a lady.â Her father then touched her right nipple.
At that time, they were in the sala, while her younger brother and sisters were already asleep in their room. Then her father carried her to her bedroom. She did not resist or struggle because she was very weak. While they were lying down on the bed, her father embraced and kissed her. She turned to her side. Her father undressed her, and she protested. Her father also undressed himself. When her father was undressing himself, she tried to shout but he covered her mouth. She tried to resist her father, but to no avail. Her father then lay on top of her and held his penis. He forced her to spread her legs and inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt pain and tried to shout, but her father covered her mouth. Her father started pumping. After her father made the push and pull movement, he warned her not to tell anyone. Then he went back to work. After her father left, she cleaned herself of bloodstain.
[5]
AAA further testified that after the incident she went to her classmate Noli Obregon who accompanied her to the police station. She reported the incident to the police authorities, but they did not believe her because they said she was still a minor. So she went home. When she arrived home, her mother was already in their house. She reported the incident to her mother. Her mother went to the workplace of her father to confront him and returned home with a black eye. The following day, her mother brought her to her grandmotherâs house in Sipalay to keep her away from her father. She stayed there until March 1998 when she was fetched by her parents. She did not immediately file a case against her father because she was afraid he might kill them. On July 27, 1998, she reported the incident to the police and it was recorded in the police blotter.
[6]
On cross-examination, AAA testified that her father had many mistresses. Her mother quarreled with his mistresses. Her mother convinced her to file a complaint against her father because her mother was angry at him because of his mistresses and also because of what happened to her. She filed her complaint directly with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in 
Escalante
 after she returned from Sipalay.
[7]
Dr. Nelly Ortines AÃ±onuevo
, rural health physician of the Municipality of 
Escalante
, Negros Occidental, testified that on July 24, 1998, she conducted a medical examination on private complainant. Her two fingers were easily admitted in the vagina of complainant; hence, complainant was no longer a virgin. Moreover, complainantâs hymen had incomplete lacerations at the 2:00 oâ clock, 3:00 oâ clock and 4:00 oâ clock positions and a complete laceration at the 6:00 oâ clock position. Said lacerations had healed. The lacerations could have been caused by the forceful penetration of a penis. The lacerations were possibly sustained by complainant around 5 months before the examination.
[8]
Dr. AÃ±onuevo issued a medical certificate
[9]
 with the following findings:
Internal examination:
= Admits two fingers easily
= Hymen â with incomplete lacerations located at 2:00 oâclock, 3:00 oâ clock and 4:00 oâ clock
= complete laceration located at 6:00 oâ clock
The Defenseâs Evidence
Johnny Viajedor
,
[10]
 40 years old, a resident of Barangay 
Balintawak, Escalante
, Negros Occidental, admitted that the private complainant is his daughter. He testified that he was a street cleaner of Balintawak. He worked from Monday to Sunday from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, then from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. On December 14, 1997, he declared that he worked from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, then from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. After he was off from work, he immediately went home. All the members of his family, including his wife, were at home. Nothing unusual happened on that day. He denied that he drank tuba or brought home a gallon of tuba. He denied that he raped his daughter AAA on said date. 
[11]
On cross-examination, appellant testified that it would take about 5 minutes by 
tri-sikad
 from his workplace to their house. Sometimes he rode his bike to work.
[12]
Moreover, appellant testified that as an employee of the local government, he was required to fill up a daily time record. He requested a copy of his daily time record for December 14, 1997 from his foreman, but it was already thrown away.
[13]
Appellant further testified that the reason why AAA filed this case against him was because he and his wife were always quarelling because he had a mistress. They said that they would put him in jail to stop his vicious habit.
[14]
Mary M. Viajedor
[15]
 (
Mary
), appellantâs wife, declared that AAA was the eldest of her seven children. Her children knew that her husband had a mistress. AAA told her that she would find a way to separate her father from his mistress.
[16]
Mary
 testified that at 4:00 p.m. of December 14, 1997, she went after her husband at the market to ask money for viand. She returned home with her husband. They ate supper together with their children. That night, AAA and her sisters and brothers occupied one bed, while she and her husband occupied another bed.
[17]
According to 
Mary
, it was not true that her husband raped AAA because AAA had a boyfriend with whom she would go out at night. When AAA informed her on December 15, 1997 that she was raped by her father, she told AAA not to file a case because she had a boyfriend. AAA told her that the reason why she filed this case against her father is to stop him from going around or living with his mistress.
[18]
On cross-examination, 
Mary
 admitted that she accompanied AAA to the DSWD and told Mrs. CaÃ±ete, a social worker, that AAA was raped. After one week, her second child told her that AAAâs complaint was not true. She did not inform the DSWD that AAAâs allegation against her husband was false because, at that time, Fely Pallotas of the DSWD already brought AAA to Bonifacio. She however informed the police, particularly one Bobby Dejoras, that the allegation of AAA was false.
[19]
Mary
 further testified that on December 16, 1997, she brought AAA to Sipalay because she had a boyfriend. At that time, AAA was 13 years old.
[20]
On September 27, 2000, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, it having been established beyond reasonable doubt that accused Johnny Viajedor had raped his own daughter, who at the time of the incident was only thirteen (13) years of age, he is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of âRape,â as charged, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the death penalty, as provided for by law, to pay the costs and to pay the victim, his daughter AAA, the sum of P50,000.
SO ORDERED.
[21]
Appellant contends that the trial court erred, thus:
I
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT ABSOLVING AND FREEING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION IN THE CASE AT BAR DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF REASONABLE DOUBT.
II
THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT IN SAN CARLOS CITY, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL (BRANCH 59) HAS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN IMPOSING OR METING OUT THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH ON THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
[22]
The Courtâs Ruling
First Issue: Whether appellantâs guilt has been proven
beyond reasonable doubt
Appellant contends that the trial court erred in not absolving him of the charge of rape. He denies that he raped his daughter AAA in the afternoon of December 14, 1997 in 
Escalante
, Negros Occidental. He asserts that his defense of denial was corroborated by his wife, who was in their house in the afternoon and in the evening of December 14, 1997. Moreover, he claims that the charge was only fabricated by his daughter who wanted him to leave his mistress. Hence, he prays for his acquittal on the ground of reasonable doubt.
Appellantâs contention is without merit.
In adjudging rape cases, the Court is guided by the following principles: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) in view of the nature of the crime in which usually only two persons are involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[23]
Nevertheless, it is settled doctrine that the testimony of a rape victim alone, if found credible, is competent to convict the accused.
[24]
 When a rape victimâs testimony is straightforward, without material or significant inconsistency, it deserves full faith and credit.
[25]
In this case, the trial court found AAAâs testimony to be categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank and gave it full credit.
[26]
 The trial court held that said testimony could not have been concocted by a 13-year-old girl against her father, just to make him leave his mistress.
[27]
 The trial courtâs findings on the credibility of witnesses carry great weight and respect and will be sustained by the appellate courts unless the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which will alter the assailed decision or affect the result of the case.
[28]
 The Court has carefully reviewed the records of this case and found no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court.
AAA convincingly testified that appellant raped her on December 14, 1997, thus:

[29]
Significantly, the complainantâs testimony is supported by the medical evidence on record. Dr. AÃ±onuevo, who examined complainant, testified that complainantâs hymen had incomplete lacerations at the 2:00 oâ clock, 3:00 oâ clock and 4:00 oâ clock positions and a complete laceration at the 6:00 oâ clock position.
[30]
 Said lacerations could have been caused by the forceful penetration of a penis.
[31]
 According to Dr. AÃ±onuevo, the vaginal lacerations were sustained by AAA about 5 months before the medical examination held on July 24, 1998, which is close to the time AAA was raped on December 14, 1997 (7 months before said medical examination).
[32]
 Dr. AÃ±onuevo also stated that complainantâs vagina easily admitted her two fingers during the internal examination, which indicated that complainant was no longer a virgin.
[33]
 As the victimâs testimony is corroborated by the physicianâs finding of penetration, there is sufficient evidence of the existence of carnal knowledge.
[34]
Appellant, however, denies that he raped his daughter AAA. He insists that he went home at 5:00 p.m. of December 14, 1997 and all the members of his family were then at home. He also asserts that his defense of denial was corroborated by his wife, who was in their house in the afternoon and evening of December 14, 1997. He testified, thus:
xxx     xxx     xxx
 
Atty. Saldavia --
 
Q
And you also worked in the afternoon and went home at 5:00 P.M.?
 
 
A
Yes.
 
 
Q
And that when you were off on December 14, 1997, you went home immediately?
 
 
A
Yes.
 
 
Q
So that while you were in your home will you please tell the court what happened?
 
 
A
Nothing unusual happened.
 
 
Q
Were the members of your family present in your house when you went home?
 
 
A
Yes, they were all there.
 
 
Q
How about your wife, was she also there?
 
 
A
She was there.
[35]
As pointed out by the trial court, said testimony of appellant was belied by the testimony of appellantâs wife, thus:
xxx     xxx     xxx
 
Atty. Garcia--
 
Q
At the time of the incident alleged by your daughter that she was raped by your husband at 4:00 oâ clock in the afternoon of December 14, 1997, were you present at that date and time?
 
 
A
I was at the public market.
 
 
Q
AAA alleged that there were only two persons in your house, herself and your husband at that time, is that correct?
 
 
A
We were all there together with my children.
 
 
Q
You want to tell us that all of you were present?
 
 
A
Yes.
 
 
Q
Can you tell the persons who were there?
 
 
A
Johnny, AAA, Gina and other children.
 
 
Q
So from 4:00 oâ clock in the afternoon of December 14, 1997 you were in your house together with your husband and children?
 
 
A
I went after my husband to ask money for viand and they were already there.
 
 
Q
Why, where was Johnny Viajedor at that time[?]
 
 
A
In the market.
 
 
Q
And when you returned home, were you together with your husband?
 
 
A
Yes. 
[36]
Appellantâs version differs from that of his wife. Evidently, their different accounts were merely concocted in an attempt to exculpate appellant from liability. We observed that 
Maryâs
 testimony was replete with inconsistencies. Notably, she admitted on cross-examination that she accompanied AAA to the DSWD and told Mrs. CaÃ±ete, a social worker, that AAA was raped.
[37]
 We can infer from 
Maryâs
 admission that, contrary to her testimony on direct examination, she was not actually present in their house in the afternoon of December 14, 1997 when the rape incident supposedly took place. If she were in their house at that time, she would have been certain that AAA was not raped by her husband and therefore she would not have accompanied AAA to the DSWD nor would she have informed a social worker there that AAA was raped. In view of said admission, we cannot give credence to 
Maryâs
 testimony that her husband did not rape AAA in the afternoon of December 14, 1997 because she, 
Mary
, went home with her husband that afternoon. An evidence to be believed must come from credible witnesses and be credible in itself.
[38]
Appellant also put up the defense of alibi. For his alibi to prosper, appellant must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time the crime was committed, but that it was likewise impossible for him to be at the 
locus criminis
 at the time of the alleged crime.
[39]
Appellant testified that on December 14, 1997, he worked from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. He failed, however, to adduce in evidence his daily time record to prove said fact on the flimsy excuse that it was thrown away by his foreman. He also failed to prove that he did not go home at 4:00 p.m. of said date. Appellant declared that their house was only about 5 minutes ride on a 
tri-sikad
 from his workplace and that, sometimes, he biked to work. 
[40]
 According to the trial court, if appellant rode on his bike on that fateful day, it would have taken him less than 5 minutes to go home.
[41]
 Considering that the house of appellant was just near his workplace, appellant failed to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be in his house at the time the rape was committed.
Appellantâs defense of denial and alibi cannot prevail over complainantâs positive identification of appellant as the one who raped her.
[42]
 Denials and alibis that are unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative and self-serving; thus, they deserve no weight in law and cannot prevail over the testimony of a credible witness who testified on affirmative matters.
[43]
Appellant further asserts that the rape charge was only fabricated by his daughter who wanted him to leave his mistress.
The Court is not persuaded.
It is inconceivable for a daughter to fabricate the charge of rape against her father, which may be punishable by death, if her sole purpose is to separate him from his mistress. Family resentment, revenge or feud have never swayed the Court from giving full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially a minor like AAA, who remained steadfast in her testimony, throughout the direct and cross-examinations, that she was sexually abused.
[44]
Based on the foregoing, the trial court correctly found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.
Second Issue: The Penalty Imposed
Appellant contends that the trial court erred in imposing the death penalty because the prosecution failed to prove the minority of private complainant. Hence, he argues that he cannot be convicted of qualified rape, but only of simple rape which is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua.
Articles 266-A of the Revised Penal Code
[45]
 provides, thus:
Art. 266-A. 
Rape. When and how committed
.-- Rape is committed --
1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
b) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;
d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
xxx     xxx     xxx
The force or violence necessary in rape is a relative term that depends on the age, size and strength of the persons involved and their relationship to each other.
[46]
 What is essential is that the act was accomplished against the will of the aggrieved person and in spite of her resistance.
[47]
 However, the Court has ruled that in a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the fatherâs parental authority and moral ascendancy over his daughter substitutes for violence and intimidation.
[48]
In this case, the complainant testified that she was made to drink tuba by her father after he arrived home, drunk.
[49]
 She drank three glasses of tuba and became very weak;
[50]
 hence, she did not struggle when her father carried her to the bedroom.
[51]
 However, she protested when her father undressed her.
[52]
 When her father was undressing himself, she tried to shout but he covered her mouth.
[53]
 She tried to resist her father, but to no avail.
[54]
In 
People v. Rodriguez
[55]
 (which involved the rape of a 16-year-old girl by her father), the Court held, âIt would be plain fallacy to say that the failure to shout or offer tenacious resistance makes voluntary the victimâs submission to the criminal act of the offender.â It is quite enough that the victim repeatedly tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to resist the advances.
[56]
 As shown earlier, complainant herein testified that appellant forced her to spread her legs. Furthermore, appellant made complainant drink tuba which weakened her and made it easier to violate her. Clearly, therefore, appellant committed rape as defined under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, subparagraph (a) above mentioned.
The trial court, however, erred in imposing the death penalty.
Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides:
Art. 266-B. 
Penalties
. â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua.
xxx     xxx     xxx
The death penalty shall xxx be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:
1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. x x x
The minority of the victim and the offenderâs relationship to the victim, which constitute only one special qualifying circumstance,
[57]
 must be alleged in the Information and proved with certainty.
[58]
 Recent rulings
[59]
 of the Court relative to the rape of minors invariably state that in order to justify the imposition of the penalty of death, there must be independent evidence proving the age of the victim, other than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses and the absence of denial by the accused. A duly certified certificate of live birth accurately showing the complainantâs age or some other authentic document such as a baptismal certificate or a school record has been recognized as competent evidence.
[60]
In the case at bar, the Information alleged that AAA was âthen 13 years old.â However, the only evidence presented by the prosecution was complainantâs testimony that when she was raped on December 14, 1997, she was 13 years old.
[61]
 The prosecution failed to present documentary evidence such as complainantâs birth certificate or baptismal certificate or her school records as competent proof of her minority. The prosecution has the burden of proving all the elements of a crime, including the qualifying circumstances, especially in death penalty cases.
[62]
 Since the prosecution failed satisfactorily to prove the minority of the complainant, appellant can only be held liable for the crime of simple rape, which is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
.
Damages
The trial court correctly awarded civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000. This award is in the nature of actual or compensatory damages, and is mandatory upon a conviction for rape.
[63]
The trial court, however, erred in not awarding moral damages, which is separate and distinct from the civil indemnity awarded to rape victims.
[64]
 Private complainant is entitled to moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 pursuant to Article 2219 of the Civil Code,
[65]
 without the necessity of additional pleading or proof other than the fact of rape.
[66]
 Moral damages is granted in recognition of the victimâs injury necessarily resulting from the odious crime of rape.
[67]
Exemplary damages may be awarded in criminal cases as part of civil liability if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.
[68]
 Relationship as an alternative circumstance under Article 15 of the Revised Penal Code is considered aggravating in the crime of rape.
[69]
 In this case, private complainant was raped by her own father. Appellant admitted the allegation of such relationship in his direct testimony.
[70]
 Hence, complainant is entitled to the award of exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000 in order to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior from preying upon their young daughters.
[71]
 The aggravating circumstance of relationship, however, does not alter the imposable penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 which is indivisible and, therefore, to be applied regardless of any attendant aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
[72]
