CARPIO MORALES, J.:


On appeal is the joint decision of regional trial court valenzuela city, branch 171, finding appellant nicanor roa guilty two counts rape in criminal case nos. 6294-v-97 and 6295-v-97 sentencing him to suffer reclusion perpetua for each count.
Two separate informations were filed on August 4, 1997 charging appellant as follows:
Criminal Case No. 6294-V-97
That on or about the 29
th
 day of July, 1997 in Valenzuela, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation employed upon the person of AAA, 14 years old, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with her against her will and without her consent.
Contrary to law.
[1]
Criminal Case No. 6295-V-97
That on or about the 25
th
 day of May, 1997 in Valenzuela, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation employed upon the person of AAA, 14 years old, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with her against her will and without her consent.    
Contrary to law.
[2]
Upon arraignment on August 15, 1997, appellant pleaded not guilty
[3]
 to both cases. Joint trial thereafter ensued.
Culled from the records of the cases are the following facts established by the prosecution:
On May 25, 1997, around 12:30 a.m., then 15-year old
[4]
 AAA (AAA) was sleeping in her room located at the third floor of the residence of her adopting parents, 
Maxima
 and 
Melencio de la Cruz
, in 
Ilang-Ilang St., Balubaran, Valenzuela City
.
[5]
 Sleeping in the same room but on a separate bed was AAAâs 23-year old mentally deranged brother.
[6]
AAA was awakened when appellant, who had resided with the 
de la Cruzes
 since 1976, he being one of the workers in the family metal craft business,
[7]
 armed with a bladed weapon, suddenly entered her room.
[8]
 Appellant then covered her mouth, held her hand and removed her shorts and panty
[9]
 after which he removed his pants and brief, went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina.
[10]
 After satisfying his carnal desire, appellant warned her not tell anyone about what happened and left the room.
[11]
More than two months after the May 25, 1997 incident or on July 29, 1997, around 1:25 a.m., AAA was, like her brother with whom she shared her bedroom, sleeping.
[12]
 She was once again awakened when appellant, also again armed with a bladed weapon, suddenly entered her room.
[13]
 Just like the May 25, 1997 incident, appellant removed her shorts and panty,
[14]
 after which he too removed his pants and brief and threatened AAA that heâll kill her if she shouted.
[15]
 Appellant thereafter went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina.
[16]
 His carnal desire satisfied, appellant left the room.
[17]
In late July 1997, AAAâs mother, after confirming from AAA herself that she was pregnant, confronted appellant about the incidents but he remained silent.
[18]
 Appellant was thereupon asked to leave as he did,
[19]
 he proceeding to 
Melencio de la Cruzâs
 fatherâs house at Iba, Hagonoy, Bulacan.
[20]
 On physical examination on August 2, 1997, AAA was found to have at least two lacerations on the genital area, and fifteen to sixteen weeks pregnant. 
On the other hand, appellant, who was 55
[21]
 when he testified on November 16, 1998, denied that he raped AAA on May 25, 1997 or on July 29, 1997. He claimed that on May 25, 1997, around 12:30 a.m., he was at work in the glass factory of 
Melencio de la Cruzâs
 niece Dory de la Cruz at Hagonoy; that on July 29, 1997, he was back at the house of the 
de la Cruzes
 at 
Balubaran
 after 
Melencio de la Cruz
 rehired him;
[22]
 and on July 23, 1997, he was confronted about the alleged rape and cursed by 
Maxima
 âbut [he] did not retaliate [and] just remained silent,â
[23]
 and on even date he left and went to the house of 
Melencio de la Cruzâs
 father at Iba, Hagonoy, Bulacan.
[24]
 
Melencio de la Cruz
, together with his bodyguard later maltreated him and haled him into the Hagonoy jail where he was detained. He did not complain, however.
Finding for the prosecution, the trial court rendered the Joint Decision on appeal the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, finding accused Nicanor Roa y Rabino Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged:
CRIMINAL CASE NO. 6294-V-97
He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 and to pay the costs. To indemnify the offended party the amount of P75,000.00.
CRIMINAL CASE NO. 6295-V-97
He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 and to pay the costs  
He is further ordered to indemnify the offended party the sum of P75,000.00.
SO ORDERED.
[25]
Appellant assails the credibility of the testimony of AAA, a close scrutiny of which he claims readily exhibits inconsistencies which go to the very core of her credibility,
[26]
 he citing the following portions of her testimony:

 (Underscoring supplied)
  
Appellant argues that âthe fact that she was already sleeping would make it impossible for [him] to lay her down again because these circumstances do not appear to be in consonance with the normal course of human nature;â
[29]
 and that while AAA attributed her pregnancy to appellant, she nevertheless admitted that she was already pregnant 
before
 May 25, 1997
[30]
 when the alleged rape subject of the first case occurred.
Appellantâs appeal is devoid of merit. 
This Court fails to see anything unusual or not being âin consonance with the normal course of human natureâ to âlay downâ one who has been awakened.
As for AAAâs attribution of her pregnancy to appellant, albeit she admitted that she was already pregnant 
before
 the first rape incident, the same does not infirm her credibility. While, given her youth, she may erred in attributing her pregnancy to appellant on account of the May 25, 1997 incident, what matters is that she was positive in her claim about the occurrence of the sexual assault on her,
[31]
 as shown in her following 
verbatim
 testimony which the trial court did find, as does this Court, to be candid and bereft of any indication that it was fabricated

The prosecution having by its evidence prima facie established appellantâs guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the burden of evidence shifted on him. Appellantâs evidence, however, is weak and fails to controvert the positive declaration of AAA who was not shown to have any reason to falsely charge him. His admitted silence when AAAâs mother confronted and even cursed him by his claim, betrays his guilt just as his passivity does when he was allegedly maltreated and haled into jail by AAAâs father on account of the incidents. For an innocent man would certainly strongly protest and deny a false accusation and do something positive to spare himself of punishment. But he did not. 
Following Section 32 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence which provides:
SECTION 32. 
Admission by silence
. â An act or declaration made in the presence and within the hearing observation of a party who does or says nothing when the act or declaration is such as naturally to call for action or comment if not true, and when proper and possible for him to do so, may be given in evidence against him.
he is, by his silence, deemed to have admitted the charges.
In fine, this Court finds that the trial court committed no error in finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape.
On the civil aspect of the cases, the trial court ordered appellant to indemnify complainant P75,000.00 for each count of rape. In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, however, the amount of P50,000.00 for each count should be awarded for purposes of civil indemnity.
[33]
And following 
People v. Sitao
,
[34]
 the victim should also be awarded moral damages of P50,000.00 for each count.
More. In 
People v. Catubig
,
[35]
 this Court held that if an aggravating circumstance is not alleged in the information but is established during trial, the complainant may still be entitled to exemplary damages. In the case at bar, although the use by appellant of bladed weapon was not alleged in the information, the testimony of AAA that he did use one suffices to entitle her to exemplary damages of P25,000.00 for each count.
WHEREFORE
, the appealed Decision dated March 30, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, Branch 171, finding appellant Nicanor Roa guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape and sentencing him in each case to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua is 
AFFIRMED
 with the 
MODIFICATION
 that for each count, appellant is ordered to pay complainant, AAA, the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.
SO ORDERED.
