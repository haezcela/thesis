FIRST DIVISION


[ A.M. No. P-04-1888, October 07, 2004 ]


OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. MR. WILHELM A. BARNEDO, UTILITY WORKER I, RTC- OCC, PASIG CITY, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




QUISUMBING, J.:


In a 
Letter
 dated February 18, 2004 Deputy Court Administrator Christopher O. Lock informed Executive Judge Jose R. Hernandez, RTC-OCC, Pasig City, that Wilhelm A. Barnedo, Utility Worker I, RTC-OCC, Pasig City incurred tardiness eleven (11) times for each month of June and July 2003.
When directed to explain within seventy-two hours (72) from receipt why no administrative sanction, pursuant to Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 23, Series of 1998,
[1]
 should be imposed against him for incurring the aforesaid tardiness, Mr. Barnedo, in a 
Letter
 dated March 11, 2004, replied that he had been tardy because as a father he shared the responsibility of administering medication to his son who was afflicted with primary complex.
In a 
Memorandum
 dated June 7, 2004, Court Administrator Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr., recommended that Mr. Barnedo be reprimanded for being habitually tardy and warned that a repetition of the same would warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.
We agree with the Court Administratorâs recommendation.
Mr. Barnedoâs administrative offense seriously compromises efficiency and hampers public service.  By being habitually tardy, an employee falls short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the administration of justice.  By reason of the nature and functions of their office, officials and employees of the Judiciary must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional canon that public office is a public trust.
[2]
 Inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment for public service, if only to recompense the Government, and ultimately, the people who shoulder the cost of maintaining the Judiciary.
[3]
 Thus, to inspire public respect for the justice system, court officials and employees are at all times behooved to strictly observe official time.  As    punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are impermissible.
[4]
We have likewise ruled that moral obligations, performance of household chores, traffic problems, health conditions, domestic and financial concerns are not reasons to excuse habitual tardiness.
[5]
Under Sec. 52 (C)(4), Rule IV of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999, habitual tardiness is penalized as follows:
 
 
First Offense
 
Reprimand 
 
 
 
Second Offense
 
Suspension for 1-30 days 
 
 
 
Third Offense
 
Dismissal from the service 
 
 
WHEREFORE
, WILHELM A. BARNEDO, Utility Worker I, RTC-OCC, Pasig City, is 
REPRIMANDED
 for being habitually tardy and 
WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or a similar offense will warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.
SO ORDERED.
Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Ynares-Santiago, 
and 
Carpio, JJ.,
 concur.
Azcuna, J.,
 on leave.
[1]
 Any employee shall be considered habitually tardy if he incurs tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes, ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or at least two (2) consecutive months during the year.
