Before the Court is the appeal of the Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 160, in Criminal Case No. 107788-H, finding the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, qualified by treachery, sentencing all of them to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and ordering them to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the deceased Ruben A. Velecina in the amount of P50,000; and to pay the said heirs P20,000 as moral damages; and, P10,000 as exemplary damages.
On March 3, 1994, accused Nelson CariÃ±o, âBoy Pansit,â appellants Domingo Banhaon, Luis Corcolon, Rogelio âBoyâ Corcolon and Lito Calong-Calong were charged with murder in the Regional Trial Court of Calamba, Laguna, originally docketed as Criminal Case No. 3953-94-C. On March 2, 1998, the Court resolved to transfer the case to the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City. The case was re-docketed and raffled to Branch 160 thereof. The accusatory portion of the information reads as follows:
That on or about July 30, 1989 at Barangay Bayog, Los BaÃ±os, Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other and with treachery, abuse of superior strength and with the aid of armed men, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to kill, attack, assault and employ violence upon the person of Ruben Velecina by then and there shooting him with powerful firearms thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal injuries in the different parts of his body which directly caused his death to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs.
[2]
Except for Nelson CariÃ±o and âBoy Pansitâ who remained at large, the rest of the accused were arrested. When arraigned, the accused, assisted by counsel, entered their respective plea of not guilty.
The Case for the Prosecution
Leopoldo CariÃ±o and his brother, Nelson CariÃ±o, Luis Corcolon, Rogelio (Boy) Corcolon, Lito Calong-Calong, Domingo Banhaon, âBoy Pansitâ and Norberto Ongjuatco were bodyguards of Mayor Antonio Sanchez of Calauan, Laguna. Leopoldo was gunned down by an unknown assailant, and Mayor Sanchez suspected that the following persons were involved in the killing: Ruben Velecina; his mother, Atanacia Velecina; his brother who was a tricycle driver, Valentin Velecina; Bernardo Velecina; and Recto Aniceto, all residents of Los BaÃ±os, Laguna.
Nelson CariÃ±o was reported to have killed Bernardo Velecina, while Recto Aniceto was reportedly shot by the group of Lito Calong-Calong. Norberto Ongjuatco, one of the bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez, secretly warned Valentin to be careful. When apprised of the impending peril to their lives, Valentin, Ruben and their mother, Atanacia, were afraid that they would be killed next on orders of Mayor Sanchez.
Isidro Velecina and Dory Perez were to be wed on July 30, 1989. A pre-nuptial party was set in    the evening of July 29, 1989, to be held in the yard of the Perez residence at Barangay Bayog, Los BaÃ±os, Laguna. Roger Perez, Doryâs father, invited his friends, and among them was Edwin Botero, a former soldier in the Philippine Army and a security guard employed at the Philippine Long Distance Company. Ruben Velecina, Isidroâs father, also invited guests of his own. Rubenâs brother, Valentin, arrived at the house with his family at about 7:00p.m. His wife, Ofelia, his mother, Atanacia, and his son Rowel were with him. Valentin, Edwin and other guests had a drinking spree in front of the house where the other guests were dancing and singing. The house was made of bamboo and wood.
Between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., July 30, 1989, Edwin noticed a white Ford Fiera with plate number 777 stop in front of the alley leading to Rogerâs house, about twenty (20) meters from where he and his friends were drinking Tanduay. The Fiera was followed by a tricycle and a galvanized owner-type jeep driven by âBoy Pansit.â Edwin saw that Mayor Sanchez was inside the Fiera, along with two others who were seated at the backseat; beside âBoy Pansitâ was Lito Corcolon. The latter alighted from the jeepney, approached Edwin and asked him if Ruben and Roger, the fathers of the persons to be wed, were inside the house. Edwin replied in the affirmative.
[3]
 Thereafter, Lito Corcolon returned to the Ford Fiera and whispered something to Mayor Sanchez.
[4]
 The Ford Fiera then drove away.
Lito Corcolon, Rogelio Corcolon, Nelson CariÃ±o, âBoy Pansit,â Lito Calong-Calong and Domingo Banhaon then alighted from the jeepney and entered the alley leading to the Perez residence. They posted themselves near the kitchen. When Valentin Velecina saw Mayor Sanchezâ men arrive, he posted himself in a dark place near the chicken coop, about seven (7) meters from the western side of the house. Valentin could see the kitchen from where he was. He could also see the bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez, all of whom were armed with short handguns.
Momentarily, Carlos Medel, Valentinâs cousin arrived near the chicken coop to urinate. When he saw Carlos, Valentin pulled his leg and told him to go to the kitchen to tell his brother, Ruben, and his mother, Atanacia, that the bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez were in the vicinity. Carlos obliged and left. Meanwhile, Ruben went to the comfort room which was near the kitchen sink and was covered by bamboo slits. As he emerged from the comfort room, Nelson CariÃ±o, Lito Calong-Calong, Rogelio and Lito Corcolon aimed their guns at the kitchen and fired successively. âBoy Pansitâ and Domingo Banhaon pulled out their guns and acted as lookouts.
People hurriedly scampered away when they heard the gunfire. There were shouts of: 
âMay patay, may patay!â
 Momentarily, Nelson CariÃ±o told his companions: 
âTayo na, yari na iyan.â
 The six bodyguards of Mayor Sanchez then left the scene and boarded the jeepney. Edwin and Valentin heard two more gunshots coming from the direction of the jeep, after which the vehicle sped away.
Meanwhile, Valentin remained behind the chicken coop until he felt that it was safe for him to come out. Momentarily, he heard his brother, Ruben, cry out, 
âAte Uping, may tama ako.â
[5]
 Valentin rushed to the kitchen and saw Ruben lying on the floor, mortally wounded.
Isidro Velecina and Roger Perez reported the incident to the police. Policemen, including Wilfredo Palacpac and Oscar Ampao, rushed to the scene,
[6]
 and saw the cadaver of Ruben lying on the ground, face down. The policemen recovered five empty shells fired from a .45 caliber gun, as well as slugs which were embedded on the cement walls of the house. In the course of the policemenâs on-the-spot investigation, no one ventured to identify the perpetrators. The shooting incident was recorded in the police blotter.
Dr. Ruben B. Escueta, the Rural Health Physician of Calauan, Laguna, conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of Ruben Velecina and submitted a report of his findings, viz:

In the meantime, Atanacia advised her son Valentin to hide, as he might be killed next. Valentin heeded his motherâs advice and hid in San Pablo City. He sought the help of the Ombudsman and the Criminal Investigation Service (CIS) of the Philippine National Police, but was    told to seek the help of the New Peopleâs Army in Quezon. He reported the shooting to NBI Director Antonio Carpio, who referred him to the police authorities in Batangas. When he went to the police authorities in Batangas and revealed the identity of his brotherâs assassins, he was told: 
âBumangga ka pala sa pader, magpahinog ka.â
Nonetheless, on March 15, 1991, Valentin sought the help of the President of the Philippines and gave a sworn statement to Norberto Galang at the Kalayaan Hall, MalacaÃ±ang, Manila.
[8]
 Edwin Botero was, however, afraid to reveal the identities of the culprits to the police authorities and that he witnessed the killing.
On August 13, 1993, Mayor Antonio Sanchez was arrested for rape with homicide. His bodyguards, the Corcolon Brothers Luis and Rogelio, had earlier surrendered to the Criminal Investigation Service for the same crime.
[9]
 Barely three (3) days after Mayor Sanchezâ arrest, Edwin Botero gave his sworn statement to the Anti-Organized Crime Division of the NBI.
[10]
 He applied for and was granted protection under the Witness Protection Program of the Department of Justice.
The Case for the Appellants
Appellant Rogelio âBoyâ Corcolon denied the charge against him and offered alibi as his defense. While admitting that he knew Mayor Antonio Sanchez,
[11]
 he denied that he had ever been in the latterâs employ. He claimed that he worked as a company guard of San Miguel Corporation.
[12]
 He related that at or about 1:00 a.m. of July 30, 1989, he was in his residence at Barangay Mabacan, Calauan, Laguna, approximately thirty minutes away from Barangay Bayog.
[13]
 He stated that he knew accused CariÃ±o as âBodoy,â but denied being with the latter on July 30, 1989. He, likewise, disclaimed knowing appellant Calong-Calong and explained that he only met him in the courtroom. He denied knowing Edwin Botero, saying that he met the latter only at the NBI. He also stated that he did not know much about Ruben Velecina and âBoy Pansit.â
For his part, Luis Corcolon claimed that at the time the incident occurred, he was a resident of Barangay Masaya. He denied knowing the victim, Ruben Velecina, but admitted that he used to see Valentin Velecina in the cockpit. He had heard of the name Nelson CariÃ±o, but denied knowing the appellant Domingo Banhaon. He only got to meet âBoy Pansitâ and Lito Calong-Calong in court.
[14]
 He, likewise, denied that he was, at any time, in the employ of Mayor Sanchez, and claimed that he knew the latter only because he was the Mayor of Calauan.
[15]
Domingo Banhaon, on the other hand, claimed that in the afternoon of July 29, 1989, he was in their residence at Barangay San Isidro, Calauan, Laguna, with the newly-eloped couple Alfredo and Lorenza Alcantara.
[16]
 As a friend and cousin of Alfredo, appellant Banhaon and his wife helped the Alcantara couple in preparing for their marriage. Appellant Banhaon fetched Barangay Captain Alberto Oroga of Barangay Lanot, and the latter accompanied them and the Alcantara couple to Alfredoâs parents, who were residing in Barangay Talang Uno, Lumban, Laguna where Alfredoâs parents resided. They left Calauan at 6:00 p.m. and reached Lumban at 8:00 p.m.
[17]
 The Banhaons helped the Alcantara couple explain their situation to Alfredoâs parents. The talk ended at around 10:00 p.m., prompting the Banhaons to spend the night at the Alcantara residence. They left Lumban for Calauan at 5:00 a.m. of July 30, 1989. Upon reaching their house, Domingo Banhaon learned of Ruben Velecinaâs death. He then attended the victimâs wake, as the latter also happened to live in the same barangay.
[18]
 He admitted that he knew the Velecina family, having worked for them as helper.
Appellant Banhaon also claimed that Valentin Velecina, the victimâs brother, knew him to have provided photography services to Mayor Sanchez. Valentin approached him, and asked him to testify and implicate the Mayor in the killing of Ruben. Appellant Banhaon also claimed that Valentin threatened to implicate him in the murder of Ruben if he refused. As he did not know anything about the circumstances of Rubenâs death, appellant Banhaon refused to testify against Mayor Sanchez. Hence, Valentin Velecina implicated him in the killing.
Appellant Banhaon presented Lorenza Alcantara as witness to corroborate his testimony.
[19]
Appellant Joselito Calong-Calong, for his part, denied any participation in the killing. He claimed that he was never employed by Mayor Sanchez, but that he worked as a truck helper at the Pepsi Bottling Company from 1976 to 1991, and then transferred to the Cosmos Bottling Company in 1992 until he was arrested. He said that he came to know Rogelio and Luis Corcolon only during the arraignment of the case.
[20]
 He also claimed that on July 29, 1989, he arrived from work at 7:00 p.m. and    stayed at home with his wife and children. He went to church the next day. On his way home, as he passed by the house of Dominador Banhaon, he learned of the death of Ruben Velecina, who lived only about âtwelve (12) Meralco posts awayâ from him. He countered that Valentin Velecina approached him to testify in the killing of Ruben. When he refused, Valentin got mad and threatened him, 
âPara kang hindi kanayon, kapag akoây nainis sa âyo, isasama kita.â
[21]
On September 30, 1996, the trial court promulgated its decision finding the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder. The dispositive portion of the decision    reads:
WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the Court finds accused LUIS CORCOLON, ROGELIO âBOYâ CORCOLON, LITO CALONG-CALONG, and DOMINGO BANHAON, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by treachery and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances present in the commission of the crime, hereby sentences, said accused to suffer a penalty of reclusion perpetua, and the accused jointly and severally to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P50,000.00, to pay moral damages of P20,000.00, exemplary damages of P10,000.00 and to pay the costs.
[22]
The trial court declared that the prosecution was able to prove and establish the crime charged and that the appellants were guilty thereof. It found Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecinaâs positive identification of the victimâs assailants credible and entitled to full probative weight, as against the denial and alibi of the appellants. It held that the initial reluctance of the aforesaid witnesses to testify against the appellants did not militate nor diminish their credibility, especially considering the perilous situation they were in. Further, Valentin Velecina had no reason to implicate his barriomates, appellants Banhaon and Calong-Calong.
The court found that the appellants conspired with one another in killing the victim, and that they committed the crime with treachery and abuse of superior strength.
The Present Appeal
The appellants now come to this Court to appeal the trial courtâs decision.
The appellant Calong-Calong assails the decision of the trial court contending as follows:
THAT THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO COMMITTED SERIOUS ERRORS IN LAW AND/OR MISAPPREHENSION OF FACTS WHEN IT FOUND THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT JOSELITO CALONG-CALONG GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF REASONABLE DOUBT AND/OR INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE AS AGAINST HIM THE ALLEGED PRESENCE OF CONSPIRACY NOT HAVING BEEN DULY PROVEN BY THE PROSECUTIONâS EVIDENCE â¦ 
[23]
Appellant Calong-Calong asserts that the trial court committed serious errors in law when it found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, considering that the evidence presented against him was insufficient, especially as witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina failed to identify him. He stressed that witness Valentin Velecina was ill-motivated in implicating him in the murder charge. He furthered that only one kind of weapon caused the wounds that led to the death of Ruben Velecina.
[24]
The appellants, Corcolon Brothers, for their part, contend that:
THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT IN PASIG CITY (BRANCH 160) HAS ERRED IN NOT ABSOLVING AND FREEING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS LUIS CORCOLON AND ROGELIO CORCOLON OF THE SERIOUS CRIME OF MURDER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF REASONABLE DOUBT IN THEIR FAVOR.
They point out that the RTC erred in finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, when the prosecution was not able to prove that they were involved in the aforesaid crime.
The appellant Banhaon, on the other hand, argues that he should be acquitted of the crime charged:
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT DOMINGO BANHAON GUILTY OF MURDER DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE THAT WOULD WARRANT A CONVICTION BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
[25]
Appellant Banhaon contends that the trial court erred in not considering his defense. He emphasized that his innocence is buttressed by his voluntary surrender and the decision to remain in jail despite an opportunity to escape during a jail break.
[26]
On the other hand, the OSG avers that the prosecution established the crime with clear and convincing evidence through the testimony of witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina. The OSG contends that, in light of the prosecution witnessesâ testimonies, the denial and alibi of the appellants cannot prevail. The prosecution, likewise, proved that the appellants, in conspiring with one another and with the use of treachery and abuse of superior strength, willfully and unlawfully, killed Ruben Velecina.
The Ruling of the Court
The threshold issue is whether or not the trial court erred in giving credence and probative weight to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses while disbelieving those of the appellants.
Well-settled is the rule that the findings of a trial court on the credibility of witnesses deserve great weight, as the trial judge has a clear advantage over the appellate magistrate in appreciating testimonial evidence. The trial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witness as he had the unique opportunity to observe the witness firsthand and note his demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination. Absent any showing that the trial courtâs calibration of credibility was flawed, we are bound by its assessment.
[27]
 Only the trial judge can observe the furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath â all of which are useful aid for an accurate determination of a witnessâ honesty and sincerity. The trial courtâs findings are accorded finality, unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight which the lower court may have overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated, and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case.
[28]
We have reviewed the records and we find no justification to deviate from the findings of the trial court. The denial of the appellants of the crime charged cannot prevail over the positive declarations of prosecution witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina. The defense of alibi is inherently weak and crumbles in the light of positive declarations of truthful witnesses, who testified on affirmative matters that the appellants were at the scene of the incident and were among the victimâs assailants.
[29]
 Positive identification where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter prevails over a denial which, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence is negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.
[30]
In this case, Valentin Velecina testified that at a distance of seven (7) meters or so, and while he was hiding in a nearby chicken coop, he saw the accused Nelson CariÃ±o, appellants Luis Corcolon, Rogelio Corcolon and Lito Calong-Calong fire their guns towards the kitchen sink, as Ruben Velecina emerged from the comfort room, while Domingo Banhaon and âBoy Pansitâ acted as lookouts. When Luis Corcolon and his cohorts stopped firing, he heard his brother say, âAte Uping, may tama ako.â  Immediately after the assailants left, he entered the house and saw his brotherâs body slumped on the ground, soaked in his own blood.

Edwin Botero corroborated the testimony of Valentin Velecina. He testified that he saw Luis Corcolon, Rogelio Corcolon, âBoy Pansitâ and two others go inside the alley leading to the back of the Perez residence. After thirty minutes, he heard shots coming from the direction of the said house. As people scampered in panic, he saw the appellants Luis Corcolon, Rogelio Corcolon and Boy Pansit come out of the alley with handguns on display. They fired shots in the air and then sped away in the jeep.

[35]
The failure of Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina to report the crime immediately after the commission thereof did not diminish their credibility. It should be remembered that different people react differently to an unusual event.
[36]
 There is no standard behavior when confronted with a strange, startling or frightful occurrence. Fear has been known to render people immobile and helpless particularly in life and death situations. Any person faced with such an overwhelming situation would sufficiently be cowed by fear or at least compelled to act in a manner aimed at self-preservation.
[37]
 Witnesses may keep silent for a time rather than risk their lives. As we ruled in 
People v. Rimorin:
[38]
That Osoteoâs fear of Rillon constrained him for ten years from revealing the crime and identifying the perpetrators to the authorities is understandable. The delay should not in any way taint his credibility. It should in fact foster credence in his revelation, considering that after ten years he did not have to come out to testify if there was no grain of truth in it.
The initial reluctance of witnesses Edwin Botero and Valentin Velecina to testify against the accused and the appellants had been satisfactorily explained. Valentin Velecina testified that he was not able to report the incident for fear that he would be the next target of the assailants who were bodyguards of Mayor Antonio Sanchez of Calauan, Laguna, especially considering that two of his relatives had been killed and that he had received death threats.
Q:
Mr. Witness, prior to the death of your brother Ruben Velecina, your nephew by the name Bernardo Velecina was killed, and after that your cousin by the name of Recto Aniceta was also killed and you suspected a certain Ruben CariÃ±o as the one who killed these two persons, is that correct?
A:
Yes, Sir.
 
 
Q:
And you believe the reason why Nelson CariÃ±o killed Ruben Velecina was because of the death of Leopoldo CariÃ±o, is that correct?
A:
Yes, Sir.
 
 
Q:
And your family was suspected behind the killing of Leopoldo CariÃ±o?
A:
Yes, Sir.
 
 
Q:
And this is the reason why up to now you are still in hiding for you believe that Nelson CariÃ±o would like to kill you?
A:
Yes, Sir.
[39]
Edwin Botero testified that it was only on August 16, 1993 that he came out because he was afraid that he would be killed by the accused and the appellants if he testified. Upon seeing his 
kababayan,
 Atty. Sacaguing of the NBI, on television regarding the Aileen Sarmenta case, he decided to testify on the victimâs behalf.
FISCAL:
Q:
Now, Mr. Witness, it appears in your statement that the date when you executed this is August 16, 1993 before the Office of Head Sergeant Artemio Sacaguing, please explain to this Court why you only executed this affidavit on August 16, 1993 when the incident happened on July 30, 1989?
A:
The reason why I did not come out because I am afraid I could not present myself as witness.
 
 
Q:
What could be the reason why you eventually change (sic) your mind and executed this affidavit?
A:
I saw Atty. Sacaguing in the (sic) T.V. and my townmate with the NBI. I voluntarily went to him to give justice to the Velecina case.
 
 
Q:
What was the topic of the TV program that inspired you to come out?
A:
About Mayor Sanchez and Kit Alquesa was inflicted (sic) with the Aileen Sarmenta case.
[40]
By then, Mayor Sanchez and his bodyguards, the appellants Luis Corcolon and Rogelio Corcolon had been placed in the custody of police authorities. Edwin Botero was so afraid for his life that he applied for and was granted protection under the Witness Protection Program of the Department of Justice.
Neither did Valentin Velecinaâs relationship with Ruben Velecina render his testimony biased. Relationship, by itself, does not give rise to any presumption of bias or ulterior motive, nor does it impair the credibility of witnesses or tarnish their testimonies. The relationship of a witness to the victim would even make his testimony more credible, it being unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime charged and prosecute another person other than the real culprit.
[41]
 Relatives of victims of crimes have a natural knack for remembering the faces of the assailants more than anybody else, and would be concerned with obtaining justice for the victim by having the felon brought to justice and meted the proper penalty.
[42]
 In the absence of any improper motive on the part of the witness, his relationship to the victim cannot impair the weight of his testimony.
[43]
We agree with the ruling of the trial court that the appellants conspired to kill Ruben.
A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.
[44]
 It need not be established by direct evidence. It may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during or after the commission of the crime which, when taken together, would be enough to reveal a community of criminal design.
[45]
 Proof of previous engagement among the malefactors to commit the crime would be unnecessary to establish conspiracy when by their overt acts it would be deduced that they conducted themselves in concert with one another.
[46]
As gleaned from the records, the following chain of events show that there was community of design among the appellants: (1) the appellants, although in separate vehicles, arrived at the scene of the crime together at approximately 12:30 a.m. on July 30, 1989; (2) accused Nelson CariÃ±o and appellants Corcolon Brothers and Lito Calong-Calong fired shots on the wall where Ruben Velecina was taking refuge, while appellant Domingo Banhaon and âBoy Pansitâ stood guard; (3) the group of Luis Corcolon stopped firing on the wall only when accused Nelson CariÃ±o assured them that the victim was dead, uttering âTayo na yari na yan;â and, (4) the group left together after shooting the wall.
In People v. Delim,
[47]
 we held that lookouts are criminally liable as principal, by direct participation.
The killing was qualified by treachery. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means or methods in the execution thereof which tend directly and specifically to insure its execution, without risk to the offender, arising from the defense which the offended party might make.
[48]
 The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in swift and unexpected manner of execution, affording the hapless and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.
[49]
 In the case at bar, the victim was inside the Perez residence and was busy preparing for the wedding of his son, Isidro Velecina, to Dory Perez, the daughter of Roger Perez. The victim was unarmed and was deprived of any means to defend himself, or to evade the sudden and unexpected assault.
The autopsy conducted by Dr. Ruben Escueta shows that the victim sustained a total of seven (7) gunshot wounds, with entrances at the back and the other wounds sustained while in a lying position. Per the autopsy report, the cause of the victimâs death was massive hemorrhage in the thoracic cavity due to accumulation of two liters of blood arising from lacerations sustained by the right lung, heart, liver and abdominal muscles.
Abuse of superior strength was also attendant. To take advantage of superior strength is to purposely use excessive force, out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.
[50]
 In the case at bar, there was clear and gross disparity of strength between the unarmed victim and the six armed assailants - four of whom used four short firearms in shooting the wall where the victim was taking refuge, while two others stood guard, also armed with short firearms. The victim, who was inside the house preparing for his sonâs wedding, gave no provocation when he was attacked. However, the aggravating circumstance of superior strength cannot be separately appreciated because it is absorbed by treachery.
[51]
It was further alleged that the offense was committed with the aid of armed men. The requisites of this aggravating circumstance are: (1) that armed men or persons took part in the commission of the crime, directly or indirectly, and (2) that the accused availed himself of their aid or relied upon them when the crime was committed.
[52]
 In this case, while the appellants were all armed, all of them acted in conspiracy with one another. All of the appellants acted in concert to ensure the commission of the crime. Hence, the aggravating circumstance cannot be appreciated. Even if it were so, the same could not be appreciated separately as it is deemed to have been absorbed by treachery.
[53]
Appellant Domingo Banhaon insists that his voluntary surrender and his refusal to escape during the jail break gives proof to his innocence. In order for voluntary surrender to be appreciated, the following requisites should be present: (1) the offender has not been actually arrested; (2) the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority or the latterâs agent; and, (3) the surrender was voluntary. Further, the surrender must be spontaneous in such a manner that it shows the interest of the accused to surrender unconditionally to the authorities, either because he acknowledged his guilt or because he wishes to save them the trouble and expenses necessarily incurred in search and capture.
[54]
In the case at bar, appellant Banhaon remained at large even after Judge Francisco Ma. Guerrero issued the warrant for his arrest on March 17, 1994.
[55]
 Appellant Banhaon surrendered only on June 27, 1995, after an alias warrant of arrest had already been issued against him, and approximately six years after the commission of the crime. Clearly, voluntary surrender cannot be appreciated in his favor as a mitigating circumstance. Neither can it be used to show his innocence. Appellant Banhaonâs failure to escape is not indicative of his innocence.
The records reveal that the crime was committed during nighttime. This circumstance is considered aggravating only when it facilitated the commission of the crime, or was especially sought or taken advantage of by the accused for the purpose of impunity. The essence of this aggravating circumstance is the 
obscuridad
 afforded by, and not merely the chronological onset of, nighttime. Although the offense was committed at night, nocturnity does not become a modifying factor when the place is adequately lighted and, thus, could no longer insure the offenderâs immunity from identification or capture.
[56]
 In the case at bar, it was not shown that nighttime was especially sought for or used to insure the offenderâs immunity from identification or capture.
We note that the Information alleges that the appellants used firearms to kill the victim. Under Republic Act No. 8294, the use of unlicensed firearm is an aggravating circumstance if such firearm is used to commit homicide or murder. However, such circumstance cannot be appreciated against the appellants because of the following: (a) the law took effect after the commission of the crime and a retroactive application thereof would be unfavorable to the appellants; and, (b) there is no allegation in the Information, nor was it proved by the prosecution that the appellants had no license or permit to possess the firearms. The lack of license or permit of the appellants to possess the firearms is a negative averment which is an essential element of the aggravating circumstance and must be alleged in the Information.
Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 7659, murder is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. However, when the crime was committed in 1989, murder was punishable by reclusion temporal maximum to death. Where no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime, the medium period of the imposable penalty, which is reclusion perpetua, should be imposed by the trial court. In this case, no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime. Hence, the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua on the appellants.
Conformably with recent jurisprudence, we sustain the amount of P50,000 for civil indemnity to the heirs of the deceased without need of any further proof.
[57]
 Exemplary damages of P25,000
[58]
 must, likewise, be awarded, in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code because of the attendance of the qualifying circumstance of treachery.
[59]
 However, the award of moral damages should be deleted in the absence of any sufficient evidence to support the same.
[60]
 The heirs of the victim are, however, entitled to temperate damages.
[61]
WHEREFORE,
 the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 160, finding the appellants Luis Corcolon, Rogelio âBoyâ Corcolon, Lito Calong-Calong and Domingo Banhaon guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS
. Said appellants are 
ORDERED
 to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of the victim, Ruben Velecina, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000) as civil indemnity; Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000) as exemplary damages; and Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000) as temperate damages. The award of moral damages is deleted.
SO ORDERED.
