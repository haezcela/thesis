THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 141877, August 13, 2004 ]


GREGORIO F. AVERIA AND SYLVANNA A. VERGARA, REPRESENTING THE ABSENTEE HEIR TERESA AVERIA, PETITIONERS, VS. DOMINGO AVERIA, ANGEL AVERIA, FELIPE AVERIA, AND THE HEIRS OF FELIMON F. AVERIA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Macaria Francisco (Macaria) and Marcos Averia contracted marriage which bore six issues, namely: Gregorio, Teresa, Domingo, Angel, Felipe and Felimon.
Macaria was widowed and she contracted a second marriage with Roberto Romero (Romero) which bore no issue.
Romero died on February 28, 1968,
[1]
 leaving three adjoining residential lots located at Sampaloc, Manila.
In a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and Summary Settlement of the Estate of Romero, the house and lot containing 150 square meters at 725 Extremadura Street, Sampaloc was apportioned to Macaria.
Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 93310 covering the Extremadura property was accordingly issued in the name of Macaria.
[2]
Alleging that fraud was employed by her co-heirs in the partition of the estate of Romero, Macaria filed on June 1, 1970 an action for annulment of title and damages before the Court of First Instance of Manila against her co-heirs Domingo Viray, et al., docketed as Civil Case No. 79955. Macaria was represented in the case by Atty. Mario C. R. Domingo. The case was pending litigation for about ten years until the decision of the Court of Appeals which adjudged Macaria as entitled to an additional 30 square meters of the estate of Romero became final and executory.
Macariaâs son Gregorio and his family and daughter Teresaâs family lived with her at Extremadura until her death on March 28, 1983.
[3]
Close to six years after Macariaâs demise or on January 19, 1989, her children Domingo, Angel and Felipe, along with Susan Pelayo vda. de Averia (widow of Macariaâs deceased son Felimon), filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila a complaint against their brother Gregorio and niece Sylvanna Vergara ârepresenting her absentee motherâ Teresa Averia, for judicial partition of the Extremadura property inclusive of the 30 square meters judicially awarded.
[4]
 The case which was docketed as Civil Case No. 89-47554 is now the subject of the present decision.
The defendants Gregorio and Sylvanna Vergara, in their February 8, 1989 Answer to the Complaint, countered that Gregorio and his late wife Agripina spent for the litigation expenses in Civil Case No. 79955, upon the request of Macaria, and the couple spent not less P20,000.00 for the purpose âwhich amount due to the inflation of the Philippine peso is now equivalent to more or less P200,000.00;â that from 1974 to 1983, Macaria was bedridden and it was Gregorioâs wife Agripina who nursed and took care of her; that before Macaria died, she in consideration of the court and other expenses which were defrayed by Gregorio and his wife in prosecuting Civil Case No. 79955 and of âthe kindness of the said couple in caring for her,â 
verbally
 sold to the spouses Gregorio and Agripina one-half (Â½) of her Extremadura property.
Gregorio and Sylvanna further countered that the plaintiff Domingo sold and assigned to the spouses Gregorio and Agripina his one sixth (1/6) share in the remaining Â½ portion of the Extremadura property.
Gregorio and Sylvanna concluded in their Answer that the plaintiffs are not co-owners of the Extremadura property as Â½ thereof is solely owned by Gregorio and 1/6 of the other half representing Domingoâs share thereof had already been sold and assigned by him (Domingo) to Gregorio and his wife who died on May 20, 1987.
[5]
During the pendency of the case or on June 7, 1989, Macariaâs son Felipe executed a Waiver-Affidavit
[6]
 waiving his âshareâ in the property subject of litigation in favor of his co-heirs.
After trial, the trial court, Branch 31 RTC of Manila, rendered a decision of July 19, 1991
[7]
 crediting the version of the defendants in this wise, 
quoted 
verbatim
:
The defendant Gregorio Averia, Sr. had established that he had paid plaintiff Domingo Averia P10,000.00 although denied by the latter but Domingo Averia did not deny receiving the amount of P5,000.00 on July 10, 1983 given by Gregorio Averiaâs wife Agrifina. According to the testimony of defendantâs witness, plaintiff Domingo Averia sold on July 10, 1983 his inheritance share in the property [consisting of a] house and lot located at 725 Extremadura because he was in . . . need of money and that he was paid P5,000.00 on July 10, 1983 by Agrifina Averia and another P5,000.00 by Major Gregorio Averia inside his room at the Makati Police Department three (3) days later. The reason why Domingo Averia became insistent in claiming his inheritance is the fact that Gregorio Averia refused the request of Domingo Averia and his children to occupy the portion of subject house which was sold to him by their mother and it was for this reason that they sought the assistance of the Citizens Legal Assistance Office (CLAO), Atty. Benjamin Roxas in writing defendant Gregorio Averia to allow him (Domingo Averia) to occupy a portion of subject house but plaintiff Domingo Averia did not tell his brothers and sisters that he had already sold his 1/6 share of the inheritance although verbally in favor of Gregorio Averia and his wife.
In the light of the foregoing, the Court, after a circumspect assessment of the evidence presented by both parties, hereby declares, that 
defendant Gregorio Averia then a major of police precinct in Makati was the person responsible for the expenses in litigation in Civil Case No. 79955, involving the property and their mother had indeed awarded him with Â½ portion of the property and that Domingo Averia sold 1/6 of [his] share of the remaining Â½ portion of the property to defendant Gregorio
. (Underscoring supplied)
Accordingly, the trial court disposed as follows, 
quoted 
verbatim
:
WHEREFORE, 
the remaining 5/6 of Â½ of the property may still be subject of partition
 among the remaining heirs but the summary settlement of the remaining estate of the 5/6 remaining portion of the estate . . . may be sold and the proceeds thereof be distributed among the heirs in accordance with the aliquot portions of each and every heir of the deceased Macaria Francisco.
Both parties are hereby ordered to shoulder their respective expenses for attorneyâs fees and litigation costs. (Underscoring supplied)
On appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA) wherein the plaintiffs Domingo et al. assigned two errors, to wit:
 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED 
IN ITS FINDING THAT THERE WAS A SALE OF ONE-HALF OF THE DECEASED MACARIA F. AVERIAâS INTEREST
 AND OWNERSHIP OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT-APPELLEE GREGORIO AVERIA.
 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED 
IN ALLOWING THE RECEPTION OF PAROL EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT DOMINGO AVERIA HAD ALREADY DISPOSED OF HIS ONE SIXTH (1/6) SHARE OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT-APPELLEE GREGORIO AVERIA
[8]
 (Emphasis supplied),
the appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court.
In reversing the trial court, the appellate court, noting that the alleged transfers made by Macaria and Domingo in favor of Gregorio were bereft of any written memoranda, held that it was error for the trial court to rely solely on the evidence adduced by the defendants consisting of the testimonies of Gregorio, Veronica Bautista, Sylvanna Vergara Clutario, Atty. Mario C.R. Domingo, Felimon Dagondon and Gregorio Averia, Jr. The CA explained its ruling in this wise:
[T]he alleged conveyances purportedly made by Macaria Francisco and plaintiff-appellant Domingo Averia are unenforceable as the requirements under the Statute of Frauds have not been complied with. Article 1403, 2(e) of the New Civil Code is explicit:
Art. 1403. The following contracts are unenforceable, unless they are ratified:
(1) x x x
(2) Those that do not comply with the Statute of Frauds as set forth in this number. In the following cases an agreement thereafter made shall be 
unenforceable by action, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing and subscribed by the party charged, or by this agent
; evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or a secondary evidence of its contents:
(a) x x x;
(b) x x x;
(e) an agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the 
sale of real property or of an interest therein
;
(f) x x xâ
The two (2) transactions in question being agreements for the sale of real property or of an interest therein are in clear contravention of the prescription that it must be in writing and subscribed by the party charged or by an agent thereof
. Hence, the strong insistence by defendants-appellees on the 
verbal conveyances cannot be made the basis for the alleged ownership
 over the undivided interests claimed by Gregorio Averia.
The parol evidence upon which the trial court anchored its award in favor of defendant-appellee Gregorio Averia is irregular as such kind of evidence is foreclosed by Article 1403 of the Civil Code
 that no evidence of the alleged agreements can be received without the writing of secondary evidence which embodies the sale of the real property. 
The introduction of the testimonies of Gregorio Averiaâs witnesses were 
timely objected to
 by plaintiffs-appellants. Since the testimonies of defendants-appelleesâ witnesses are inadmissible, then such exclusion has pulled the rug under the assailed decision
 of the trial court and it has no more leg to stand on.
In the vain attempt to salvage the situation, 
defendants-appellees however argue that the Article 1403 or the Statute of Frauds does not apply because the same only refers to purely executory contracts and not to partially or completely executed contracts
.
This contention is untenable. It was not amply demonstrated how such alleged transfers were executed since plaintiffs-appellants have 
vigorously objected
 and opposed the claims of ownership by defendants-appellees
. He who asserts a fact or the affirmative of an issue has the burden of proving it. Defendants-appellees miserably failed in this respect.
While this Court cannot discount the fact that either 
defendant-appellee Gregorio Averia or plaintiff-appellant Domingo Averia may have valid claims against the estate of Macaria Francsico, such matter can best be threshed out in the proceedings for partition before the court a quo bearing in mind that such partition is subject to the payment of the debts of the deceased under Article 1078 of the Civil Code
.
[9]
 (Citations omitted; Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
The appellate court thus remanded the case to the trial court.
WHEREFORE,
 the decision dated July 19, 1991 is reversed and set aside. The case is 
remanded
 to the court a quo which is directed to 
effect the partition
 of the subject property or if not, possible, sell the entire lot and distribute the proceeds of the sale based on equal shares among the children of the late Macaria Francisco 
after debts of the said deceased are paid or settled pursuant to Article 1078 of the Civil Code
.
[10]
 (Underscoring supplied)
Gregorio and Sylvannaâs motion for reconsideration having been denied by the appellate court, they lodged the Petition for Review on Certiorari at bar upon the following assignment of errors:
 THE COURT OF APPEALS (SECOND DIVISION) 
ERRED IN ITS FINDING THAT THERE WAS NO SALE
 OF ONE-HALF (1/2) OF THE DECEASED MACARIA F. AVERIAâS INTEREST AND OWNERSHIP OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER GREGORIO F. AVERIA.
 THE COURT OF APPEALS (SECOND DIVISION) 
ERRED IN ITS FINDING THAT THE RECEPTION OF PAROL EVIDENCE
 TO THE EFFECT THAT RESPONDENT DOMINGO AVERIA HAD ALREADY SOLD HIS ONE SIXTH (1/6) SHARE IN THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER GREGORIO AVERIA 
IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW
.
[11]
Petitioners contend that contrary to the findings of the Court of Appeals, they were able to amply establish, by the testimonies of credible witnesses, the conveyances to Gregorio of Â½ of the Sampaloc property and 1/6 of the remaining half representing the share of Domingo.
[12]
With respect to the application by the appellate court of the Statute of Frauds, petitioners contend that the same refers only to purely executory contracts and not to partially or completely executed contracts as in the instant case. The finding of the CA that the testimonies of petitionersâ witnesses were timely objected to by respondents is not, petitioners insist, borne out in the records of the case except with respect to the testimony of Gregorio.
[13]
Petitioners thus conclude that respondents waived any objection to the admission of parol evidence, hence, it is admissible and enforceable
[14]
 following Article 1405
[15]
 of the Civil Code.
[16]
The Court finds for petitioner.
Indeed, except for the testimony of petitioner Gregorio bearing on the verbal sale to him by Macaria of the property, 
the testimonies of petitionersâ witnesses Sylvanna Vergara Clutario and Flora Lazaro Rivera
 bearing on the same matter were not objected to by respondents. Just as the 
testimonies of Gregorio, Jr. and Veronica Bautista
 bearing on the receipt by respondent Domingo on July 23, 1983 from Gregorioâs wife of P5,000.00 representing partial payment of the P10,000.00 valuation of his (Domingoâs) 1/6 share in the property, and of the 
testimony of Felimon Dagondon
 bearing on the receipt by Domingo of P5,000.00 from Gregorio were not objected to. Following Article 1405 of the Civil Code,
[17]
 the contracts which infringed the Statute of Frauds were ratified by the failure to object to the presentation of parol evidence, hence, enforceable.
ARTICLE 1403. The following contracts are 
unenforceable, unless they are ratified
:
x x x
(2) Those that do not comply with the Statute of Frauds as set forth in this number. 
In the following cases an agreement hereafter made shall be unenforceable by action, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing, and subscribed by the party charged, or by his agent; evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or a secondary evidence of its contents:
x x x
(e) An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property or of an interest therein;
x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),
Contrary then to the finding of the CA, the admission of parol evidence upon which the trial court anchored its decision in favor of respondents is not irregular and is not foreclosed by Article 1405.
In any event, the Statute of Frauds applies only to 
executory
 contracts and not to contracts which are either partially or totally performed.
[18]
 In the case at bar, petitioners claimed that there was total performance of the contracts, full payment of the objects thereof having already been made and the vendee Gregorio having, even after Macariaâs death in 1983, continued to occupy the property until and after the filing on January 19, 1989 of the complaint subject of the case at bar as in fact he is still occupying it.
In proving the fact of partial or total performance, oral evidence may be received as what the trial court in the case at bar did. Noted civilist Arturo M. Tolentino elucidates on the matter:
The statute of frauds is 
not applicable to contracts which are either totally or partially performed
, on the theory that there is a wide field for the commission of frauds in executory contracts which can only be prevented by requiring them to be in writing, a fact which is reduced to a minimum in executed contracts because the intention of the parties becomes apparent by their execution, and execution concludes, in most cases, the rights of the parties. 
However it is not enough for a party to allege partial performance in order to render the Statute of Frauds inapplicable; such partial performance must be duly proved. But neither is such party required to establish such partial performance by documentary proof before he could have the opportunity to introduce oral testimony on the transaction. The partial performance may be proved by either documentary or oral evidence.
[19]
 (Emphasis, underscoring and italics supplied)
The testimonies of petitionersâ witnesses being credible and straightforward, the trial court did not err in giving them credence.
The testimony of Sylvana Vergara Clutario, daughter of Teresa, in fact was more than sufficient to prove the conveyance of half of the subject property by Macaria to Gregorio.

Not only on account of Sylvanaâs manner of testifying that her testimony should be given weight. 
Her testimony was against the interest of her mother Teresa whom she represented, her mother being also an heir of Macaria
. If the transfer by Macaria to Gregorio of Â½ of the property is upheld as valid and enforceable, then the share of the other heirs including Sylvannaâs mother would considerably be reduced.
That Atty. Mario C. R. Domingo who was admittedly Macariaâs counsel in Civil Case No. 79955 (which, as priorly reflected, entailed a period of ten years in court), affirmed on the witness stand that Gregorio and his wife were the ones who paid for his attorneyâs fees amounting to P16,000.00
[21]
 should no doubt strongly lend credence to Gregorioâs claim to that effect.
As to the sale of Domingoâs 1/6 share to Gregorio, petitioners were able to establish said transaction by parol evidence, consisting of the testimonies of Gregorio Averia, Jr.,
[22]
 Veronica Averia
[23]
 and Felimon Dagondon
[24]
 the presentation of which was, it bears repeating, not objected to.
Albeit Domingo never denied having received the total amount of P10,000.00 from Gregorio and his wife, he denied having sold to Gregorio his interest over the property. Such disclaimer cannot, however, prevail over the categorical, positive statements of petitionersâ above-named witnesses.
In sum, not only did petitionersâ witnesses prove, by their testimonies, the forging of the contracts of sale or assignment. They proved the full performance or execution of the contracts as well.
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is hereby 
GRANTED.
 The January 31, 2000 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 44704 is hereby 
SET ASIDE.
The case is hereby remanded to the trial court, Branch 31 of the RTC of Manila, for appropriate action, following Section 2 of Rule 69 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
