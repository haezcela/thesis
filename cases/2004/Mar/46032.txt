PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ANDRES PAAS ISLABRA, APPELLANT. 
 DECISION




PUNO, J.:


Before us for automatic review is the Decision dated November 27, 2001
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, Branch 19, in Criminal Case Nos. 2522-23 finding Andres Paas Islabra guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one count of simple rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, and one count of qualified rape and sentencing him to death.
The private complainant, thirteen-year-old Hilda Paas, and accused-appellant, thirty-two-year-old Andres Islabra, are first cousins, the formerâs father, Rogelio, being the brother of the latterâs mother, Rosita.  In 1997 Hilda and her brothers, Rodelio, Rolando, and Rodolfo came to Magsaysay, Sultan Kudarat to study and work as farmhands, respectively, while their parents remained in Columbo, Sultan Kudarat. They stayed in the house of accused-appellant upon the latterâs invitation while their own house was still under construction. Younger sisters Margielyn, eight years old, and Mary Jane, seven years old, joined them later on.  All was apparently well.  However, on July 29, 1998, Hilda executed a sworn written complaint accusing Andres of raping her on two occasions.  Two separate Informations were filed against Andres, 
viz
:
Criminal Case No. 2522 
 That on or about 8:00 oâclock in the evening of July 4, 1998, at Barangay Magsaysay, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with lewd and unchaste design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully (
sic
), unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of one HILDA A. PAAS, a thirteen (13)-year old girl, against her will and consent.
CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, as amended by Republic Act 7659.
[2]
 
 Criminal Case No. 2523 
 That on or about 11:30 oâclock in the morning of July 12, 1998, at Barangay Magsaysay, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with lewd and unchaste design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully (
sic
), unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of one HILDA A. PAAS, a thirteen (13)-year old girl, against her will and consent.
CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, as amended by Republic Act 7659.
[3]
 
 Accused-appellant pleaded ânot guiltyâ to both Informations.  Trial ensued.
Private complainant testified that at around 8:30 in the evening of July 4, 1998 she was sleeping in the house of accused-appellant while her three brothers were watching television in a neighborâs house.  Accused-appellant woke her up, warned her not to make any noise, kissed her face, removed her underwear and took his penis out of his short pants.  She asked accused-appellant, whom she called âKuyang Andres,â why he was doing those things but the latter again warned her not to make any noise or she would be killed. Accused-appellant then inserted his penis into her vagina but after a partial penetration, withdrew the same when complainant complained of pain.  He threatened complainant against reporting the incident to anybody, otherwise, he would kill her and her brothers.  After accused-appellant left, complainant cried and examined her vagina.  Fluid was oozing from it.  She left her cousinâs house the following morning, never to return.  She stayed in the house of a neighbor  until she and her brothers moved on July 9, 1998 to their newly-constructed house
[4]
 located about a hundred meters away from that of accused-appellant. Gripped by fear, complainant did not inform her brothers of the incident.
[5]
Anent the second rape incident, complainant testified that at around 11:30 in the morning of July 12, 1998, accused-appellant arrived at their newly-constructed house and asked her and her sister Margielyn if they had eaten lunch.  They answered âno.â Margielyn then went outside to play.  Thereupon, accused-appellant, armed with a knife, ordered complainant into a room, instructed her not to shout, otherwise, he would kill her. Complainant complied out of fear.  Accused-appellant ordered her to remove her underwear and likewise removed his own.  He then laid complainant, who was already crying, on the bed, kissed her on the face and neck, inserted his penis fully into her vagina, and did push and pull movements for about seven minutes while holding complainant by her hands.  After satisfying his lust, accused-appellant got up and put on his short pants.  At this point, Margielyn entered the room and asked what âKuyang Andresâ was doing in the room.  The latter did not answer.  Instead, he told them not to report the matter to anybody, and left in a huff.  Hilda confided to Margielyn the incident.  When Rodelio arrived at noon, Margielyn in turn narrated to him the event.  Rodelio cried and punched the wall of their house in anger.
[6]
  He wanted to confront accused-appellant but was restrained by Rodolfo.
[7]
  After their parents were informed that Hilda had been raped, they arrived from Columbo and immediately brought their daughter to the police station where she executed her sworn written complaint.  She was also brought to the Provincial Hospital where she was medically examined on July 29, 1998.
Accused-appellant denied the charges.  Backed up by the testimony of his wife and mother-in-law, accused-appellant claimed that Hilda and her brothers were no longer staying in his house at the time of the alleged rape on July 4, 1998, having left the same by the time his wife gave birth on December 27, 1997.  Hence, he said, he could not have raped her there.  Besides, he was not home in the evening of July 4, 1998 having left the same early in the morning with his two sons, Balong and Dagol, for their farm located about two kilometers away where they spent the whole day and passed the night.  They returned home the following morning.
[8]
As to the alleged rape at noon on July 12, 1998, accused-appellant claimed that he was in the house of his neighbor Jun Movilla from nine in the morning to two oâclock in the afternoon having a drinking spree with the latter and his brother Edwin, as well as with his cousins Rodelio and Rodolfo, private complainantâs brothers.
[9]
 His wife saw him the whole time since Junâs house was just across the road from their house.
The defense likewise imputed motive on the part of complainantâs family in filing the rape charges. Rosita Calla, accused-appellantâs mother, testified that complainantâs parents, Rogelio and Marta, her brother and sister-in-law, respectively, got angry with her when she helped a granddaughter find a lawyer in 1993 after she was allegedly raped by Roger Paas, one of complainantâs brothers. Since then, Rositaâs relationship with her brother and sister-in-law turned sour.
[10]
  Rodrigo Islabra, accused-appellantâs brother, likewise testified that complainantâs father told him when he went to speak to private complainant after Andres was arrested for the rape charges, that they will incur the same expenses that complainantâs family incurred when it was Roger who was accused of rape in 1993.
[11]
On November 27, 2001, the trial court rendered a decision convicting the accused and sentencing him to suffer 
reclusion perpetua
 in Crim. Case No. 2522, and death in Crim. Case No. 2523. He was likewise ordered to pay private complainant P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape, and to pay the costs.
Hence, this automatic review.
Accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the alleged rape committed in his house on July 4, 1998 considering that Rodelio Paas testified that he and his siblings left the same in January 1998.  Moreover, private complainantâs unbelievably composed behavior after the rape of turning on the light, coolly examining her vagina and observing the fluid oozing therefrom are inconsistent with that of a real rape victim.  As to the second rape incident, accused-appellant contends that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of Hilda and Mary Jane Paas and the contradictory results of the medical examination justify an acquittal.  Even if he was indeed guilty of the second rape, the death penalty should not have been imposed considering that use of a knife in the commission thereof was not alleged in the Information.
The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), while maintaining that accused-appellantâs guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt in both cases, agreed that the death penalty should not have been imposed in Crim. Case No. 2523.
We affirm the trial courtâs decision with modification.
The rule is well-settled that an accused in rape cases may be convicted solely on the basis of the uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim where such testimony is clear, positive, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.
[12]
 Her credibility is the single most important issue, and when her testimony meets the test of credibility, conviction inevitably ensues.
[13]
In the instant cases, the court 
a quo
 found private complainantâs account of how she was raped by the accused in the evening of July 4, 1998 and at noon of July 12, 1998 to be clear, positive and straightforward,

And instead he left?
 
 
 
A:-
 
He answered, sir, but he told us âdo not report this to anybody.â

Accused-appellant contends that complainantâs claim that he raped her on July 4, 1998 in his house was tainted by her brother Rodelioâs testimony that they were no longer staying there at the time, having already left in January 1998.
We do not agree.  A careful review of Rodelioâs testimony reveals that he was not unequivocal on this point.  During his direct-examination, Rodelio testified that he and his siblings stayed in accused-appellantâs house until they moved on July 6, 1998 into their own house.  However, in another breath, he said that they were no longer staying there on July 4, 1998.
[16]
 But during his cross-examination, he again affirmed that they were still staying in the house of their cousin on the date in question
[17]
 and reiterated the same during his re-direct examination on October 7, 1999.  The trial judge perceived Rodelioâs vacillation as arising from his ignorance as to the proper order of the months in a year, whether January or July comes first, prompting him to ask about Rodelioâs educational attainment, 
viz
:
 
 
 
Q:-
 
Tell the Court once more, until when did you stay with your sibling in the house of Andres Paas and transferred to your house?
 
 
 
A:-
 
It was sometime in the month of January, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
What year?
 
 
 
A:-
 
In 1998, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
Earlier you said in your answer to the question of the Provincial Prosecutor that on July 4, 1998 you were still residing in the house of Andres Paas, and now your are telling the court that you left the house of Andres Paas on July 4, 1998, which is which now?
 
 
 
A:-
 
I cannot remember anymore the date, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
What is your educational attainment?
 
 
 
A:-
 
Only Grade VI, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
Do you know how many months (
sic
) in a year?
 
 
 
A:-
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
What is the first month of the year?
 
 
 
A:-
 
January, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
So, you are now telling the Court that on January 4, 1998 you have already left the house of the accused together with your brothers and sisters and transferred to your newly built (
sic
) house?
 
 
 
A:-
 
On that date January 4, 1998 we have not yet transferred to our new house, your Honor.
[18]
 
 
In light of the above, we cannot consider Rodelioâs testimony as having dented private complainantâs positive and straightforward testimony that she was raped by accused-appellant on the evening of July 4, 1998 in his own house. There is another reason for Rodelioâs apparent vacillation in his testimony.  It can be due to the fact that he and brother Rodolfo slept in their own house from time to time, leaving their sister in accused-appellantâs house, even while their house was still undergoing construction, as testified to by accused-appellant himself, 
viz
:
 
 
 
Q:-
 
The construction of the house of her brothers was finished in the month of October 1997?
 
 
 
A:-
 
The construction of the house was not immediately finished, Your Honor, because of lack of materials to be used for the construction of their house, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
In other words, because of lack of materials the house was only completed the following year 1998?
 
 
 
A:-
 
Actually what happened they (
sic
) built a new house and they only put roofing and in completing that they only used a tent which serves (
sic
) as walling of the house and the two were already sleeping in that house, I am referring to Balong and Sandy.
[19]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:- 
 
 
Only the two of them?
 
 
 
A:-
 
During nighttime only, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
When was that when Balong and Sandy were already sleeping on (
sic
) their unfinished newly constructed house?
 
 
 
A:-
 
After they finished putting the roofing of their house thatâs the time they started sleeping in their unfinished house.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x                         x x x                    x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
And because their house was not yet walled they only used temporary walling only Sandy and Balong can be accomodated in that house?
 
 
 
A:-
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
It does (
sic
) not fit for a woman to sleep there?
 
 
 
A:-
 
 
Sometimes the other siblings were also sleeping (
sic
) in that house.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
And that house was only completed sometime in January or February 1998, was it not?
 
 
 
A:-
 
No, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
When was it completed?
 
 
 
A:-
 
In my own, as far as I can remember about December 5, 1997.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:-
 
And they all transferred in their house on December 5, 1997, is that what you mean?
 
 
 
A:-
 
I could not say, sir, that they transferred in that house on that date, December 4, 1997, because after they slept on that day in their own house they again (
sic
) sleep in my house and again they transferred to their newly built (
sic
) house and thatâs the time they stayed in their house.
[20]
 
 
The defense likewise denounces private complainantâs actuations after the alleged first rape of turning on the light, coolly examining her vagina and observing the fluid oozing therefrom, as not befitting that of a real rape victim.  We do not agree.  It is not accurate to say that there is a typical reaction or norm of behavior among rape victims.
[21]
 On the contrary, people react differently to emotional stress and no standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement.
[22]
On the alleged inconsistencies between the testimonies of Hilda and Mary Jane Paas on whether Hilda was laid on the bed by accused-appellant as claimed by Hilda or on the floor as testified to by Maryjane, and whether it was Margielyn who reported what happened to Rodelio, as testified to by Hilda, or whether Rodelio learned about it during the drinking spree in Jun Movillaâs house, as claimed by Mary Jane, suffice it to say that inconsistencies on minor or trivial matters do not affect the credibility of prosecution witnesses and are, on the contrary, badges of truth and safeguards against coached testimony.
[23]
Finally, the defense takes exception to the alleged contradictory results of the medical examination conducted on private complainant. That is, while Dra. Divinagracia Factora, Medical Officer III of the Sultan Kudarat Provincial Hospital, testified that private complainantâs labia majora and minora are well-coaptated or âmagkadikitâ which indicates virginity, she likewise testified that private complainantâs vaginal canal sustained healed superficial lacerations at 2:00 and 6:00 positions.
The medico-legal certificate issued by Dra. Factora showed the following findings: 
 PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
 
 
-
 
Labia majora and minora are well coaptated.
 
 
 
-
 
Healed superficial laceration at 2:00 and 6:00 oâclock positions of the vaginal canal.
[24]
 
 
 
 Although Dra. Factora indeed testified in the beginning that coaptated or â
magkadikit
â labia majora and minora indicates virginity,
[25]
 in the latter part of her testimony, however, she clarified that the same may or may not actually be a sign of virginity.
[26]
 In the particular case of private complainant, she could not definitely say that private complainant was a virgin or not.  On the contrary, superficial healed lacerations at 2:00 and 6:00 positions were definitely found on her, one of the causes of which may be a hardened human penis.
[27]
 Thus, while Dr. Factoraâs explanation of âcoaptatedâ labia may be a bit nebulous, it cannot be said that it contradicted private complainantâs testimony of the rapes committed against her.  At any rate, a medical examination or certificate has never been considered an indispensable element in the prosecution of rape cases
[28]
 being merely corroborative in nature.
[29]
We come to the penalty imposed in Crim. Case No. 2523: The death penalty was imposed by the trial court considering that the second rape incident was accomplished with the use of a knife.  Under the second paragraph of Art. 266-B
[30]
 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, the proper imposable penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.  The death penalty was imposed after the trial court further considered that complainant was raped in her own house, hence, the aggravating circumstance of dwelling was appreciated in her favor.
We reduce the penalty to 
reclusion perpetua
. Qualifying circumstances which increase the penalty by degree rather than merely affect the period of the penalty as in the case of aggravating circumstances must be properly pleaded in the information consistent with the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him.
[31]
 Thus, when the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a rape was not alleged in the information, the penalty would be that prescribed for simple rape only, which is reclusion perpetua, to be imposed regardless of the presence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, pursuant to Art. 63 of the Revised Penal Code. 
[32]
Since the use of a knife was not alleged in the information in Crim. Case No. 2523, accused-appellant may be held liable for simple rape only and accordingly sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
.  His conviction and sentence in Crim. Case No. 2522 are affirmed.  The civil indemnity of P75,000.00 awarded by the trial court must likewise be reduced to P50,000.00, consistent with jurisprudence.
[33]
IN VIEW WHEREOF
, the decision under review is 
MODIFIED
 in that accused-appellant is held guilty of simple rape only in Crim. Case No. 2523, and accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.  The civil indemnity awarded by the trial court in both Crim. Case Nos. 2522 and 2523 are reduced to P50,000.00.  The decision is 
AFFIRMED
 in all other respects.
