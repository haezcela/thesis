st

âALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERED, this Office respectfully recommends that:
  
A. Ms. SUSAN BELANDO be SUSPENDED for three (3) months without pay, this being her fourth incursion of habitual tardiness;
  
B. The following employees be REPRIMANDED:
  
Ms. SHIRLEY MARY SANTOS
  
  
Ms. YOLANDA I. REYES
  
  
Ms. BLYTHE M. LUMAGUE
  
  
Mr. EDUARD Dâ ANGELO SAN JUAN II
  
  
Mr. RUDY C. GARCIA
  
  
Mr. MACARIO M. REGUETA
  
  
Ms. TESSIE B. ARIQUEZ
  
  
Mr. GERARDO H. ALUMBRO
  
  
Mr. LITO EDUARDO L. ORTEGA
  
  
Atty. CONRAD TOLENTINOâ
[6]
In her second Memorandum dated February 10, 2004, Atty. Candelaria recommended the imposition of the corresponding administrative penalties on the employees listed therein who committed habitual tardiness for the 2
nd
 semester of 2003:
A. The following employees be SUSPENDED for ten (10) days for commission of habitual tardiness for the 3
rd
 time:  
Renato Labay, Medical and Dental Services; and     
Albert Semilla, Office of the Chief Attorney;  
B. The following employees be SEVERELY REPRIMANDED with WARNING for commission of habitual tardiness for the 2
nd
 time:
  
Don Semundo Balneg, Property Division, OAS;  
  
Armida M. Salazar, Philippine Judicial Academy;  
  
Romeo Daniel M. Salazar, Office of the Reporter;  
  
Atty. Darwin de Leon, Office of the Chief Attorney;
  
Blythe M. Lumague, Philippine Judicial Academy;
C. The following employees be SEVERELY WARNED for commission of the offense for the 1
st
 time:  
Efren Ascrate, Library Services;  
  
Christopher Barles, Judicial and Bar Council;  
  
Vernon Bayuga, Program Management Office;   
Joran Carinan, Public Information Office;  
  
Lyra A. Encinares, Philippine Judicial Academy; 
  
Marino Iglesias, Maintenance Division, OAS;  
  
Rouschelle G. Mercado, Philippine Judicial Academy;  
  
Jocelyn Guillermo, Accounting Division, FMBO;  
  
Florentino A. Pascual, OAS, OCA;  
  
Jerry Payson, Court Management Office;  
  
Danilo M. Trivinio, Court Management Office;  
  
Ireneo Infante, Court Management Office;  
  
Felix M. Jadulan, Jr., Court Management Office;  
  
Erwin Serrano, Property Division, OAS;  
  
Glenda Francisca M. Cagadoc, Office of ACA Carlos L. de Leon 
This Office takes exception to the case of MR. ERWIN OCSON and MS. MA. THERESA OLIPAS, CMO, OCA, since based on the records of this Office, this is supposedly the 1
st
 time that they have committed habitual tardiness after their records were transferred from OAS, OCA to this office.  
These employees have already been suspended for thirty (30) days by the Court in its resolution dated May 4, 2001 for commission of habitual tardiness for the 1st time. Verification from the 201 files of these employees disclosed that on June 13, 2000, then Court Administrator Alfredo Benipayo directed Mr. Ocson to explain why he should not be REPRIMANDED for having been habitually tardy in the months of July, August, October, November and December, 1999. Then, on February 2, 2001, another letter was sent by then Court Administrator Benipayo which states in part:
 âRecords will show that on June 2000, you were WARNED for your habitual tardiness and that a repetition of said violation will be severely dealt in accordance with existing Civil Service Rules.â
 In the same letter, Mr. Ocson was likewise directed to explain why he again committed habitual tardiness for the months of January, February, March, June, July, October and November 2000.  
For her part, Ms. Olipas was on June 14, 2000 directed to explain why she should not be REPRIMANDED for having been habitually tardy for 12 months in 1999.  
The Memorandum Report on these tardiness and that of the other employees of the Office of the Court Administrator was submitted only for the first time for the consideration of the Honorable Court on April 17, 2001 for habitual tardiness committed in the years 1999 and 2000. As a consequence thereof, Mr. Ocson and Ms. Olipas were suspended for thirty (30) days.  
For purposes of consistency and uniformity in the application of penalties for habitual tardiness for employees of the Court, including the Office of the Court Administrator, this Office, with due respect to the Honorable Court, would like to consider that this is only the 2
nd 
time that Mr. Ocson and Ms. Olipas have been charged with habitual absenteeism and recommend that they be SEVERELY REPRIMANDED WITH WARNING, that a commission of the same or similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely. This request and recommendation is premised on the fact that this is only the second time that their habitual tardiness will be submitted for the Honorable Courtâs consideration.
[7]
Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 14, s. 1991, as amended provides: 
âAn officer or employee of the civil service be considered habitually tardy if he incurs tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or at least two (2) consecutive months during the year. . . â
There is no question that the above-named employees incurred habitual tardiness. Such administrative offense seriously compromises efficiency and hampers public service. By being habitually tardy, these employees have fallen short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the administration of justice. By reason of the nature and functions of their office, officials and employees of the Judiciary must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional cannon that public office is a public trust.
[8]
 Inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service, if only to recompense the Government, and ultimately, the people who shoulder the cost of maintaining the Judiciary.
[9]
 Thus, to inspire public respect for the justice system, court officials and employees are at all times behooved to strictly observe official time. As punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are impermissible.
[10]
As correctly found by Atty. Candelaria, none of the reasons relied upon by respondents to justify their habitual tardiness merits our consideration. We have ruled that moral obligations, performance of household chores, traffic problems, health conditions, domestic and financial concerns are not sufficient reasons to excuse habitual tardiness.
[11]
Under Sec. 52 (C) (4), Rule VI of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999,
[12]
 habitual tardiness is penalized as follows: 
First Offense â Reprimand  
Second Offense â Suspension for 1-30 days  
Third Offense â Dismissal from the service
In the case of Susan L. Belando, this Court, in an En Banc Resolution dated August 14, 2003, found her habitually tardy for the third time. A strict application of the above provision would have justified her dismissal from the service. Instead, for humanitarian reasons, she was meted the penalty of only suspension for thirty (30) days with a warning that she will be dismissed from the service if she will commit the same offense in the future. Notwithstanding such warning, she incurred habitual tardiness for the fourth time. We believe, however, that to dismiss her from the service is too harsh. Again, for humanitarian reasons, we agree with Atty. Candelaria that a suspension for three (3) months without pay is appropriate.
With respect to Renato Labay and Albert Semilla, this Court, in an 
En Banc
 Resolution dated November 27, 2002, found them habitually tardy for the second time and were suspended and warned. In the instant case, they committed tardiness for the third time and that, therefore, they should be dismissed from the service. Again, for humanitarian reasons and as recommended by Atty. Candelaria, the penalty of suspension for ten (10) days without pay is in order.
As to respondents Efren Ascrate, Christopher Barles, Vernon Bayuga, Jordan Carinan, Lyra A. Encinares, Marino Iglesias, Rouschelle G. Mercado, Jocelyn Guillermo, Florentino A. Pascual, Jerry Payson, Danilo M. Trivinio, Ireneo Infante, Felix M. Jadulan, Jr., Erwin Serrano, Glenda Francisca M. Cagadoc, who committed tardiness for the first time, we cannot go along with Atty. Candelariaâs recommendation that they should only be warned. Instead, they should be reprimanded pursuant to the Civil Service Rule earlier cited, providing that for the first offense of habitual tardiness, the penalty is reprimand.
Likewise, we cannot agree with Atty. Candelaria that the following employees should only be reprimanded, namely: Shirley Mary Santos, Yolanda I. Reyes, Blythe M. Lumague, Eduard DâAngelo San Juan II, Rudy C. Garcia, Macario M. Regueta, Tessie B. Arquez, Gerardo H. Alumbro, Lito Eduardo ZuÃ±iga, Liberato L. Ortega, Don Segmundo Balneg, Armida M. Salazar, Romeo Daniel M. Salazar, Atty. Darwin de Leon, Erwin Ocson, Ma. Theresa Olipas. Considering that they committed the offense for the second time, they should be suspended from the service for five (5) days without pay, following the same Civil Service Rule.
WHEREFORE
, we find the following employees of this Court administratively liable for habitual tardiness and meted the corresponding penalties, thus:  
Susan Belando is 
SUSPENDED
 for three (3) months without pay, this being her fourth offense;  
  
Renato Labay is 
SUSPENDED
 for ten (10) days without pay, this being his third offense; 
  
Albert Semilla is 
SUSPENDED
 for ten (10) days without pay, this being his third offense;  
  
Efren Ascrate, Christopher Darwin F. Barles, Vernon Bayuga, Jordan Carinan, Lyra A. Encinares, Marino Iglesias, Rouschelle G. Mercado, Ma. Jocelyn Guillermo, Florentino A. Pascual, Jerry Payson, Danilo M. Trivinio, Ireneo Infante, Felix M. Jadulan, Jr., Erwin Serrano, Glenda Francisca M. Cagadoc are 
REPRIMANDED
 for being habitually tardy for the first time;
  
Shirley Mary A. Santos, Yolanda I. Reyes, Blythe M. Lumague, Eduard Dâ Angelo San Juan II, Rudy C. Garcia, Macario M. Regueta, Tessie B. Arquez, Gerardo H. Alumbro, Lito Eduardo ZuÃ±iga, Liberato L. Ortega, Atty. Conrad S. Tolentino, Don Segmundo Balneg, Armida M. Salazar, Romeo Daniel M. Salazar, Atty. Darwin de Leon Erwin Ocson, Ma. Theresa Olipas are 
SUSPENDED
 for five (5) days without pay for being habitually tardy for the second time.
Furthermore, they are all 
WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or a similar offense will warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.
SO ORDERED.
