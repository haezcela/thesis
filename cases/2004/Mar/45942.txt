 AND RICHARD C. TAN, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ATTY. EDILBERTO BARCELONA, RESPONDENT.
 RESOLUTION




PER CURIAM:


On May 9, 2001, Dan Joel V. Lim and Richard C. Tan,
[1]
 both businessmen, filed a complaint for alleged robbery or extortion and violation of the 
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
 against Atty. Edilberto Barcelona, a lawyer formerly employed with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The complaint was simultaneously filed with this Court and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
[2]
Complainant Lim alleged that on the first week of August 2000, respondent phoned him and introduced himself as a lawyer and chief of the Public Assistance Center, NLRC.  Respondent informed him that his employees filed a labor complaint against him in his office and it was necessary for him to see and talk with respondent. From then on respondent would often call him. Respondent visited him in his office and told him to settle the case or else his business, Top Gun Billiards, would be shut down.  Lim recalled that on August 14, 2000, at around 7:30 p.m., respondent again visited his establishment and told him to settle the case for P20,000.00.
In support of his allegations, Lim submitted a written complaint of Arnel E. Ditan and Pilipino Ubante; an endorsement letter dated August 2, 2000 of Atty. Jonathan F. Baligod of the Presidential Action Center; handwritten calling cards of the respondent; and an affidavit of desistance executed by Ditan and Ubante.
In their joint affidavit, Ditan and Ubante confirmed the filing of their complaint against their employer, Lim, and that after some dialogue, the aforenamed employees executed an affidavit dated August 8, 2000 withdrawing their complaint.  According to Ditan and Ubante, they met the respondent in Top Gun Billiards where the latter often played billiards. One day, respondent gave them a letter and asked them to sign it.  Since they were busy at that time, they signed it without reading and understanding its contents.  Their employer, Lim, asked what it was about and they told him that they were just made to sign a document without their understanding it.  They added, they did not have any complaint against their employer.  Despite such withdrawal, respondent still called Lim threatening the latter that he would pursue the case, have his establishment closed and he would be jailed if he did not come up with P20,000.00 as settlement. In the evening of August 14, 2000, respondent reiterated his demand for P20,000.00, again with the threat of closure of the billiard center and putting Lim in jail.
Complainant Lim said that after his meeting with respondent, he agreed to give the amount but did not fix any date when payment would be made, whereupon, respondent gave notice that he would drop in at around 7:00 in the evening, on August 16, 2000, to pick up the money.
Aurora Cruz y Libunao, owner of the carinderia adjacent to Top Gun Billiards, stated in her sworn statement as well as court testimony that she met respondent when he ate in her carinderia. She recalled that the respondent told her that he would shut down the billiard business if the owner would not talk to him.  She also recounted that on August 14, 2000, at around 8:30 p.m., she saw on the second floor of the pool house, the respondent and Lim talking.  After a while, the respondent came down and passed by her carinderia.  The respondent then informed her that he and Lim talked about the P20,000.00 which respondent would give to his alleged boss in MalacaÃ±ang. During the hearing, she also recalled seeing Lim hand money to respondent who in turn put the cash in his attachÃ© case and immediately thereafter, she saw three men arrest respondent.
[3]
Notably, almost nine months before the filing of his complaint, or on August 14, 2000, complainant Lim personally submitted a letter to the NBI requesting the NBI to investigate respondent Atty. Edilberto Barcelona.
[4]
 According to the NBI report, after due investigation, it decided to conduct an entrapment operation.  On August 15, 2000, Special Investigator Marvin de Jemil, sent nine five hundred peso bills and five one hundred peso bills for fluorescent powder dusting to the NBI Forensic Chemistry Division. Further, the NBI reported that thru the NBI Identification and Records Division, it found no record of such person named Edilberto Barcelona.
The NBI report also stated that on August 16, 2000, Lim informed the NBI operatives that at around 7:00 p.m. respondent would drop by his pool house to collect the money.  At around 6:30 p.m., the operatives went to the pool house and strategically positioned themselves and posed as pool players.  At about 7:20 p.m., respondent arrived, sat on a plastic chair and talked to complainant Lim.  At around 7:30 p.m., Lim handed the marked money to the respondent who, in turn, received it.  While respondent was counting the money and about to place it inside his bag, he was immediately arrested. The respondent initially resisted and tried to create scandal but was later pacified.
The NBI averred that the respondent was informed of his constitutional rights and was brought to the NBI office where he was booked and fingerprinted.  In his fingerprint chart, the respondent indicated that he was a government lawyer and assigned at the office of the Chief, Public Assistance Center, NLRC, Banawe, Quezon City.  He showed his identification card. Later he was brought to the Forensic Chemistry Division for ultraviolet examination.  The certification issued by Forensic Chemist Loren G. Janobas stated that there were âyellow fluorescent specks and smudgesâ on the back and palm of the left and right hand of the respondent. On August 17, 2000, the NBI turned over respondent to the City Prosecutor of Manila who eventually indicted him for robbery/extortion.
[5]
Complainant Richard Tan, owner of Tai Hing Glass Supply, a co-signee in the herein complaint, executed a sworn statement dated August 16, 2000. In it he alleged that he went to the Criminal Intelligence Division, Intelligence Service of the NBI to complain about respondent Barcelona.  He said that sometime during the last week of July, respondent called him, introduced himself and informed him that one of his employees filed an illegal dismissal case against him. He remembered that before respondentâs call, he had suspended an employee, Bryan Tellen, for leaving his workplace without permission. Tellen received several warning letters from him regarding his misdemeanors. Tan remembered that Tellen once hinted that he knew someone in the Department of Labor, who turned out to be herein respondent, Atty. Barcelona.  Before Tan sent his accountant, Ditas Guitierrez, to respondentâs office to represent him, he told her to bring a copy of Tellenâs suspension letter and to inform respondent that Tellen had not been dismissed.  When Guitierrez returned, she told him that respondent wanted him to pay his employee. She added that respondent did not give her any copy of a formal complaint on the alleged illegal dismissal. After two days, according to Tan, respondent went to his office, showed him an identification card and gave him a handwritten calling card. Respondent told him to pay his employee P20,000.00 to P30,000.00, otherwise respondent would go on with  the filing of the illegal dismissal case.  When he said he did not have that kind of money, respondent lowered the amount to P15,000.00.  Complainant Tan added that when he gave respondent the money, the latter promised to take care of the illegal dismissal complaint. On July 29, 2000, according to Tan, respondent came to see him again.  Respondent appeared drunk and told Tan to go to the respondentâs office because a problem regarding the case arose.  Tan stated that before respondent left, respondent invited his employees to a game of billiards.  Tan said he did not consent to the employees playing because they had work. On July 31, 2000, respondent went to him a third time and asked for an additional P10,000.00 allegedly for his employee, Tellen, since the P15,000.00 Tan gave earlier was for respondent only. After a few more visits by respondent, Tan finally told the respondent to show him the formal complaint and he would just get himself a lawyer.
[6]
The Joint Affidavit of Arrest, signed on August 17, 2000 by Agent Don R. Hernandez, SI Felix O. Senora and SI Marvin de Jemil, cited complainant Tanâs allegations.
[7]
Respondent Atty. Barcelona filed his Comment
[8]
 on December 10, 2001, praying for the dismissal of the complaint against him.  Respondent, in his defense, alleges that he normally played billiards at the Top Gun Billiard Center where he would drop by from his office before going to his residence; that when certain employees of the billiard center learned that he was a lawyer and Chief of the Public Assistance Center of the NLRC, they confided in him their grievance against their employer, Lim, for alleged violation of labor laws, there respondent gave them assistance; that with the proper complaint and required documentation accomplished, respondentâs office scheduled the case for a dialogue-conference between the complaining workers and their employer; that on instigation and coercion of complainant Lim, respondent became a victim of theft, billiard hustling, swindling and syndicated gambling on August 9, 2000; that on or about August 9, 2000, respondent filed a complaint for theft of cellphone and pack of cigarettes, billiard hustling, syndicated gambling, and swindling against Lim and his three workers, eventually docketed as I.S. No. 38251 to 53.
[9]
Respondentâs Comment narrated his version on how the money allegedly was given to him. According to the respondent, on August 16, 2000, at about 3 p.m., he received a phone call from complainant Lim informing him that Ian Gonvan,
[10]
 one of the accused in I.S. No. 38251, admitted taking his cellphone and was willing and ready to return it at around 7 p.m., at the Top Gun Billiard Center.  It was the birthday of his daughter that was why he took the day off from office. At about 7:30 p.m., he arrived at the billiard hall and there found Lim with one of his complaining workers, fixing the lamp of one of the billiard tables. He did not see Gonvan within the premises so he sat and watched the billiard games going on while he waited. After about 15 minutes Lim sat beside him and told him that Gonvan could no longer return the cellphone and instead Gonvan entrusted Lim with the equivalent value in cash.  According to respondent, Lim persistently whispered to him to accept and count the wad of paper money Lim pulled out.  According to respondent, he consistently refused to touch the money and he insisted, â
Gusto ko munang makaharap ang sinasabi mong si Gumban
,â
[11]
 continuously refusing to accept, much less count, the offered wad of money.  Respondent added that when Lim realized that he could not be prevailed upon to accept it, he placed and inserted the wad of money in the open side pocket of respondentâs shoulder bag that respondent normally carried, again pleading to respondent that he should count the money. Respondent added that Limâs behavior was rude and intimidating so much so that respondent protested such rudeness.  But respondent said while he was trying to retrieve the wad of money to throw it back to Lim, about five or seven burly men accosted respondent and handcuffed him over his vehement protestations.
[12]
On Tanâs complaint, respondent declared that he never demanded nor received money from Tan, and Tanâs accusations are but a product of the formerâs fertile imagination as leverage because he actively assisted a complaining worker of Tan.
[13]
 Respondent added that a formal labor complaint has been filed against Tan.
[14]
Eventually, we referred the complaint against Atty. Barcelona to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.  Its report with recommendation is now before us.  We shall now proceed to the merits of the complaint.
Respondentâs version seeks to discredit the NBI report to the effect that respondent accepted the marked money which Lim handed to him.  His version, however, fails to explain why he was found positive for yellow fluorescent specks and smudges in his dorsal and palmar aspects of the left and right hands by the Forensic Department of the NBI.
Respondent claims that he continuously refused to accept, much less count, the offered wad of money.  Because of such refusal, according to respondent, Lim inserted the wad of money in respondentâs shoulder bagâs open pocket while complainant Lim was still pleading to count the wad of money.
Respondent alleges that the alleged bribery or extortion is a mere concoction of complainant and as leverage for the cases against Lim and Tan.
Based on the NBI report, this case appears to be an entrapment operation.  Notably, Atty. Don Hernandez and his team of arresting officers confirm the entrapment operation against respondent on the basis of complainant Limâs call for NBI assistance.
While respondent alleges that complainant Lim merely concocted a charge of extortion against him in retaliation to a complaint for theft which he had filed, it may be noted that the complaint for theft was not directed against Lim but only against his workers who were accused by respondent.  Hence, there appears to be no strong reason for Lim to resort to a counter-charge for extortion against respondent.
The Commission on Bar Discipline of the IBP concluded that it is highly improbable that the NBI could be misled by complainant Lim into conducting an entrapment operation against respondent, if there was no merit to his complaint against respondent.  From a reading of the NBI Report as well as the documents attached to said report, it is evident that the NBI considered the merits of Limâs complaint of extortion against respondent.  Finding it worth pursuing, the NBI conducted an entrapment operation against respondent.  On the basis of the entrapment operation conducted by the NBI, respondent was caught in the act, so to speak, of attempted extortion.  Respondent was brought to the City Prosecutor of Manila for inquest and the appropriate complaint for Robbery/Extortion was filed against respondent.
[15]
Based on its own evaluation and the NBI Report, the Investigating Commissioner of the Commission on Bar Discipline recommended the suspension of respondent from the practice of law for a period of two years.
[16]
In the final resolution dated September 27, 2003, the Board of Governors of the IBP imposed the penalty of disbarment for the reason that respondent in fact attempted to extort money as Chief of the Public Assistance Center of the NLRC to threaten/coerce Lim and that no less than the NBI caught him in the act of receiving and counting the money extorted from Lim.
[17]
The grounds for disbarment or suspension of an attorney are: (1) deceit; (2) malpractice or other gross misconduct in office; (3) grossly immoral conduct; (4) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude; (5) violation of the lawyerâs oath; (6) willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court; and (7) willfully appearing as an attorney for a party without authority.
[18]
The NBI found that respondentâs hands had yellow fluorescent specks and smudges with which the money used for the entrapment of the respondent had been powdered. We find no reason to doubt the NBI report.  Also, we see no basis to overturn the presumption that the NBI had done its duty regularly.
Respondent would make us believe that the specks and smudges of yellow fluorescent were in his hands because Lim offered him what was allegedly the payment for the stolen cellphone by a certain Gonvan. Regrettably, there is no corroboration from Gonvan nor anyone else on this matter. Thus, respondentâs story appears to us entirely self-serving.
We had held previously that if a lawyerâs misconduct in the discharge of his official duties as government official is of such a character as to affect his qualification as a lawyer or to show moral delinquency, he may be disciplined as a member of the Bar on such ground.
[19]
 More significantly, lawyers in government service in the discharge of their official tasks have more restrictions than lawyers in private practice.  Want of moral integrity is to be more severely condemned in a lawyer who holds a responsible public office. 
[20]
 Rule 1.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides that a lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system. Extortion by a government lawyer, an outright violation of the law, calls for the corresponding grave sanctions.  With the aforesaid rule a high standard of integrity is demanded of a government lawyer as compared to a private practitioner because the delinquency of a government lawyer erodes the peopleâs trust and confidence in the government.
Needless to say, lawyers owe it to the court and to society not to stir up litigations.  Employees of the billiards hall, Ditan and Ubante, swore that respondent public officer encouraged complainant Limâs workers to file a case against the latter.  Rule 1.03 of the same Code states that a lawyer shall not, for any corrupt motive or interest, encourage any suit or proceeding or delay any manâs cause.
Noteworthy, as an Attorney IV and Chief of the Public Assistance Center of the NLRC, respondent failed to observe prudence by hanging out and playing in the billiard hall.  By so doing, he exposed himself unnecessarily to certain elements and situations which could compromise his official position and his status as a lawyer.
Time and again, we have declared that the practice of law is a noble profession.  It is a special privilege bestowed only upon those who are competent intellectually, academically and morally.  A lawyer must at all times conduct himself, especially in his dealings with his clients and the public at large, with honesty and integrity in a manner beyond reproach.  He must faithfully perform his duties to society, to the bar, to the courts and to his clients.  A violation of the high standards of the legal profession subjects the lawyer to administrative sanctions which includes suspension and disbarment.
[21]
 More importantly, possession of good moral character must be continuous as a requirement to the enjoyment of the privilege of law practice; otherwise, the loss thereof is a ground for the revocation of such privilege.
[22]
Indeed, the primary objective of administrative cases against lawyers is not only to punish and discipline the erring individual lawyers, but also to safeguard the administration of justice by protecting the courts and the public from the misconduct of lawyers and to remove from the legal profession persons whose utter disregard of the lawyerâs oath has proven them unfit to continue discharging the trust reposed in them as members of the bar.
[23]
 These pronouncements gain practical significance in this case, considering that respondent is a senior lawyer of the NLRC.  It bears stressing also that government lawyers who are public servants owe fidelity to the public service, a public trust.  As such, government lawyers should be more sensitive to their professional obligations as their disreputable conduct is more likely to be magnified in the public eye.
[24]
As a lawyer, who was also a public officer, respondent miserably failed to cope with the strict demands and high standards of the legal profession.
In 
Montano v. IBP
,
[25]
 this Court said that only in a clear case of misconduct that seriously affects the standing and character of the lawyer may disbarment be imposed as a penalty.  In the instant case, the Court is convinced that the evidence against respondent is clear and convincing.  He is administratively liable for corrupt activity, deceit, and gross misconduct.  As correctly held by the Board of Governors of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, he should not only be suspended from the practice of law but disbarred.
WHEREFORE
, respondent Atty. Edilberto Barcelona is found administratively guilty of corrupt activity, deceit, and gross misconduct and is hereby ordered 
DISBARRED
.  Let his name be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys effective immediately, and this resolution spread in his record in this Court and circulated to all courts in the Philippines.
