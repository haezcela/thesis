SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


Before us is a petition for review on certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals dated September 12, 2000 and its Resolution dated December 1, 2000 in CA-G.R. SP No. 54541, entitled â
Avelina Zamora, et al., petitioners, versus Heirs of Carmen Izquierdo, represented by the executrix, Anita F. Punzalan, respondents
.â
The records show that sometime in 1973, Carmen Izquierdo and Pablo Zamora entered into a verbal stipulation whereby the former leased to the latter one of her apartment units located at 117-B General Luna Street, Caloocan City.  They agreed on the following: the rental is P3,000.00 per month; the leased premises is only for residence; and only a single family is allowed to occupy it.
After the death of Carmen (lessor) in 1996 her attorney-in-fact, Anita Punzalan, representing the heirs, herein respondents, prepared a new contract of lease wherein the rental was increased from P3,000.00 to P3,600.00 per month.
[3]
 However, petitioners refused to sign it.
In January 1997, Pablo (lessee) died.  His wife, Avelina Zamora, and their children (two of whom have their own families), herein petitioners, continued to reside in the apartment unit.  However, they refused to pay the increased rental and persisted in operating a photocopying business in the same apartment.
Meanwhile, petitioner Avelina Zamora applied with the Metropolitan Waterworks & Sewerage System (MWSS) for a water line installation in the premises. Since a written consent from the owner is required for such installation, she requested respondentsâ attorney-in-fact to issue it. However, the latter declined because petitioners refused to pay the new rental rate and violated the restrictions on the use of the premises by using a portion thereof for photocopying business and allowing three families to reside therein.
This prompted petitioner Avelina Zamora to file with the Office of the 
Punong Barangay
 of 
Barangay
 16, 
Sona
 2, District I, 
Lungsod ng Caloocan
, a complaint against Anita Punzalan (respondentsâ attorney-in-fact), docketed as â
Usaping Bgy. Blg
. 1-27-97, 
Ukol sa: Hindi Pagbibigay ng Pahintulot sa Pagpapakabit ng Tubig
.â
On August 24, 1997, during the 
barangay
 conciliation proceedings, petitioner Avelina Zamora declared that she refused to sign the new lease contract because she is not agreeable with the conditions specified therein.
The following day, Anita Punzalan sent Avelina a letter
[4]
 informing her that the lease is being terminated and demanding that petitioners vacate the premises within 30 days from notice.
Despite several 
barangay
 conciliation sessions, the parties failed to settle their dispute amicably.  Hence, the 
Barangay
 Chairman issued a Certification to File Action dated September 14, 1997.
[5]
Consequently, on October 2, 1997, respondents, represented by Anita Punzalan, filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC), Branch 49, Caloocan City, a complaint for unlawful detainer and damages against petitioners, docketed as Civil Case No. 23702.
[6]
 Forthwith, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss
[7]
 the complaint on the ground that the controversy was not referred to the 
barangay
 for conciliation.  
First
, they alleged that the 
barangay
 Certification to File Action âis fatally defectiveâ because it pertains to another dispute, i.e., the refusal by respondentsâ attorney-in-fact to give her written consent to petitionersâ request for installation of water facilities in the premises.  And, 
second
, when the parties failed to reach an amicable settlement before the 
Lupong Tagapamayapa
, the 
Punong Barangay
 (as 
Lupon
 Chairman), did not constitute the 
Pangkat ng Tagapagkasundo
 before whom mediation or arbitration proceedings should have been conducted, in violation of Section 410(b), Chapter 7 (
Katarungang Pambarangay
), Title One, Book III of Republic Act No. 7160
[8]
 (otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991), which reads:
âSECTION 410.  
Procedure for Amicable Settlement
.â
(a) x x x
(b)
 
Mediation by lupon chairman
 â Upon receipt of the complaint, the 
lupon
 chairman
[9]
 shall, within the next working day, summon the respondent(s), with notice to the complainant(s) for them and their witnesses to appear before him for a mediation of their conflicting interests.  
If he fails in his mediation effort
 within fifteen (15) days from the first meeting of the parties before him, 
he shall forthwith set a date for the constitution of the 
pangkat
 in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.â (Underscoring supplied)
Respondents opposed the motion to dismiss,
[10]
 the same being prohibited under Section 19 of the 1991 Revised Rule on Summary Procedure.  They prayed that judgment be rendered as may be warranted by the facts alleged in the complaint, pursuant to Section 6
[11]
 of the same Rule.
On July 9, 1998, the MTC issued an Order
[12]
 denying petitionersâ motion to dismiss and considering the case submitted for decision in view of their failure to file their answer to the complaint.
Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration,
[13]
 contending that a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of failure to refer the complaint to the 
Lupon
 for conciliation is allowed under Section 19 of the 1991 Revised Rule on Summary Procedure, which partly provides:
âSEC. 19. 
Prohibited pleadings and motions
. â The following pleadings, motions, or petitions shall not be allowed in the cases covered by this Rule:
 
 
 
(a)
 
Motion to dismiss the complaint
 or to quash the complaint or information 
except on the ground of
 lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or 
failure to comply with the preceding section
 [referring to Section 18 on referral of the complaint to the 
Lupon
 for conciliation];
 
 
x x x.â
On August 26, 1998, the MTC rendered a Judgment
[14]
 in favor of respondents and against petitioners, the dispositive portion of which reads:
âWHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, ordering defendants and all persons claiming right under them:
 
 
 
1)
 
To vacate the leased premises located at No. 117-B General Luna Street, Caloocan City and to surrender possession thereof to the plaintiff;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)
 
To pay the amount of three thousand six hundred (P3,600.00) pesos per month starting January, 1997 until the premises being occupied by them is finally vacated and possession thereof is restored to the plaintiff;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3)
 
To pay plaintiff the sum of five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos as and for attorneyâs fees; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4)
 
To pay the costs of this suit.
 
 
SO ORDERED.â
On appeal, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 125, Caloocan City, rendered its Decision
[15]
 dated February 15, 1999 affirming the MTC Judgment. Subsequently, it denied petitionersâ motion for reconsideration.
[16]
Petitioners then filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 54541.  On September 12, 2000, it rendered a Decision
[17]
 affirming the RTC Decision.
Thereafter, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but was denied by the Appellate Court in its Resolution dated December 1, 2000.
[18]
Hence, the instant petition.
I
The primordial objective of Presidential Decree No. 1508 (the 
Katarungang Pambarangay
 Law), now included under R.A. No. 7160 (the Local Government Code of 1991), is to reduce the number of court litigations and prevent the deterioration of the quality of justice which has been brought about by the indiscriminate filing of cases in the courts.
[19]
 To attain this objective, Section 412(a) of R.A. No. 7160 requires the parties to undergo a conciliation process before the 
Lupon
 Chairman 
or
 the 
Pangkat
 as a precondition to filing a complaint in court, thus:
âSECTION 412.  
Conciliation
. â (a) 
Pre-condition to Filing of Complaint in Court
.â No complaint, petition, action, or proceeding involving any matter within the authority of the lupon shall be filed or instituted directly in court or any other government office for adjudication, unless there has been a confrontation between the parties before the 
lupon
 chairman 
or
 the 
pangkat
, and that no conciliation or settlement has been reached as certified by the 
lupon
 or 
pangkat
 secretary and attested to by the 
lupon
 or 
pangkat
 chairman x x x.â (Underscoring supplied)
In the case at bar, the 
Punong Barangay
, as Chairman of the 
Lupong Tagapamayapa
, conducted conciliation proceedings to resolve the dispute between the parties herein.  Contrary to petitionersâ contention, the complaint does not only allege, as a cause of action, the refusal of respondentsâ attorney-in-fact to give her consent to the installation of water facilities in the premises, but also petitionersâ violation of the terms of the lease, specifically their use of a portion therein for their photocopying business and their failure to pay the increased rental.  As correctly found by the RTC:
âThe records show that confrontations before the barangay chairman were held on January 26, 1997, February 9, 1997, February 23, 1997, February 28, 1997, July 27, 1997, August 3, 1997, August 10, 1997, August 17, 1997 and August 24, 1997 wherein not only the issue of water installation was discussed but also the terms of the lease and the proposed execution of a written contract relative thereto.  It appears, however, that no settlement was reached despite a total of nine meetings at the barangay level.
It is of no moment that the complaint was initially made by defendant-appellant Avelina Zamora because herein plaintiff-appellee was given by the Sangguniang Barangay the authority to bring her grievance to the Court for resolution.  While it is true that the Sertifikasyon dated September 14, 1997 is entitled âUkol Sa Hindi Pagbibigay Ng Pahintulot Sa Pagpapakabit Ng Tubigâ, this title must not prevail over the actual issues discussed in the proceedings.
Hence, to require another confrontation at the barangay level as a sine qua non for the filing of the instant case would not serve any useful purpose anymore since no new issues would be raised therein and the parties have proven so many times in the past that they cannot get to settle their differences amicably.â
[20]
We cannot sustain petitionersâ contention that the 
Lupon
 conciliation alone, without the proceeding before the 
Pangkat ng Tagapagkasundo
, contravenes the law on 
Katarungang Pambarangay
.  Section 412(a) of R.A. No. 7160, quoted earlier, clearly provides that, as a precondition to filing a complaint in court, the parties shall go through the conciliation process 
either
 before the 
Lupon
 Chairman (as what happened in the present case), 
or
 the 
Pangkat
.
Moreover, in 
Diu vs. Court of Appeals
,
[21]
 we held that ânotwithstanding the mandate in Section 410(b) of R.A. No. 7160 that the 
Barangay
 Chairman shall constitute a 
Pangkat
 if he fails in his mediation efforts,â the same âSection 410(b) should be construed together with Section 412(a) of the same law (quoted earlier), as well as the circumstances obtaining in and peculiar to the case.â Here, while the 
Pangkat
 was not constituted, however, the parties met 
nine (9) times
 at the Office of the 
Barangay
 Chairman for conciliation wherein not only the issue of water installation was discussed but also petitionersâ violation of the lease contract.  It is thus manifest that there was substantial compliance with the law which does not require strict adherence thereto.
[22]
II
We hold that petitionersâ motion to dismiss the complaint for unlawful detainer is proscribed by Section 19(a) of the 1991 Revised Rule on Summary Procedure, quoted earlier.  Section 19(a)  permits the filing of such pleading only when the ground for dismissal of the complaint is anchored on lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or 
failure by the complainant to refer the subject matter of his/her complaint âto the 
Lupon
 for conciliationâ
 prior to its filing with the court.  This is clear from the provisions of Section 18 of the same Rule, which reads:
âSEC. 18. 
Referral to Lupon
.
 â 
Cases requiring referral to the 
Lupon
 for conciliation
 under the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1508 
where there is no showing of compliance with such requirement, shall be dismissed without prejudice
, and may be revived only after such requirement shall have been complied with.  This provision shall not apply to criminal cases where the accused was arrested without a warrant.â (Underscoring supplied)
As discussed earlier, the case was referred to the 
Lupon
 Chairman for conciliation.  Obviously, petitionersâ motion to dismiss, even if allowed, is bereft of merit.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED
. The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 54541 sustaining the Decision of the RTC which upheld the MTC Judgment is 
AFFIRMED
.
Costs against petitioners.
