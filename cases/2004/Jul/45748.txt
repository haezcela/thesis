TINGA, J,:


âGood fences make good neighbors,â so observed Robert Frost, the archetype of traditional New England detachment.  The 
Frost
 ethos has been heeded by nations adjusting to the effects of the liberalized global market.
[1]
 The Philippines, for one, enacted Republic Act  (Rep. Act) No. 8751 (on the imposition of countervailing duties), Rep. Act No. 8752 (on the imposition of anti-dumping duties) and, finally, Rep. Act No. 8800, also known as the Safeguard Measures Act (âSMAâ)
[2]
 soon after it joined the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement.
[3]
The SMA provides the structure and mechanics for the imposition of emergency measures, including tariffs, to protect domestic industries and producers from increased imports which inflict or could inflict serious injury on them.
[4]
 The wisdom of the policies behind the SMA, however, is not put into question by the petition at bar.  The questions submitted to the Court relate to the means and the procedures ordained in the law to ensure that the determination of the imposition or non-imposition of a safeguard measure is proper.
Antecedent Facts
Petitioner Southern Cross Cement Corporation (âSouthern Crossâ) is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of cement manufacturing, production, importation and exportation. Its principal stockholders are Taiheiyo Cement Corporation and Tokuyama Corporation, purportedly the largest cement manufacturers in Japan.
[5]
Private respondent Philippine Cement Manufacturers Corporation
[6]
 (âPhilcemcorâ) is an association of domestic cement manufacturers. It has eighteen (18) members,
[7]
 per 
Record
.  While Philcemcor heralds itself to be an association of domestic cement manufacturers, it appears that considerable equity holdings, if not controlling interests in at least twelve (12) of its member-corporations, were acquired by the three largest cement manufacturers in the world, namely Financiere Lafarge S.A. of France, Cemex S.A. de C.V. of Mexico, and Holcim Ltd. of Switzerland (formerly Holderbank Financiere Glaris, Ltd., then Holderfin B.V.).
[8]
On 22 May 2001, respondent Department of Trade and Industry (âDTIâ) accepted an application from Philcemcor, alleging that the importation of gray Portland cement
[9]
 in increased quantities has caused declines in domestic production, capacity utilization, market share, sales and employment; as well as caused depressed local prices. Accordingly, Philcemcor sought the imposition at first of provisional, then later, definitive safeguard measures on the import of cement pursuant to the SMA. Philcemcor filed the application in behalf of twelve (12) of its member-companies.
[10]
After preliminary investigation, the Bureau of Import Services of the DTI, determined that critical circumstances existed justifying the imposition of provisional measures.
[11]
 On 7 November 2001, the DTI issued an 
Order
, imposing a provisional measure equivalent to Twenty Pesos and Sixty Centavos (P20.60) per forty (40) kilogram bag on all importations of gray Portland cement for a period not exceeding two hundred (200) days from the date of issuance by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) of the implementing 
Customs Memorandum Order
.
[12]
 The corresponding 
Customs Memorandum Order
 was issued on 10 December 2001, to take effect that same day and to remain in force for two hundred (200) days.
[13]
In the meantime, the Tariff Commission, on 19 November 2001, received a request from the DTI for a formal investigation to determine whether or not to impose a definitive safeguard measure on imports of gray Portland cement, pursuant to Section 9 of the SMA and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. A notice of commencement of formal investigation was published in the newspapers on 21 November 2001. Individual notices were likewise sent to concerned parties, such as Philcemcor, various importers and exporters, the Embassies of Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan, contractors/builders associations, industry associations, cement workersâ groups, consumer groups, non-government organizations and concerned government agencies.
[14]
 A preliminary conference was held on 27 November 2001, attended by several concerned parties, including Southern Cross.
[15]
 Subsequently, the Tariff Commission  received several position papers both in support and against Philcemcorâs application.
[16]
 The Tariff Commission also visited the corporate offices and manufacturing facilities of each of the applicant companies, as well as that of Southern  Cross and two other cement importers.
[17]
On 13 March 2002, the Tariff Commission issued its Formal Investigation Report (âReportâ). Among the factors studied by the Tariff Commission in its Report were the market share of the domestic industry,
[18]
 production and sales,
[19]
 capacity utilization,
[20]
 financial performance and profitability,
[21]
 and return on sales.
[22]
  The Tariff Commission arrived at the following conclusions:
The circumstances provided in Article XIX of GATT 1994 need not be demonstrated since the product under consideration (gray Portland cement) is not the subject of any Philippine obligation or tariff concession under the WTO Agreement. Nonetheless, such inquiry is governed by the national legislation (R.A. 8800) and the terms and conditions of the Agreement on Safeguards.
The collective output of the twelve (12) applicant companies constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of gray Portland cement and blended Portland cement.
Locally produced gray Portland cement and blended Portland cement (Pozzolan) are âlikeâ to imported gray Portland cement.
Gray Portland cement is being imported into the Philippines in increased quantities, both in absolute terms and relative to domestic production, starting in 2000.  The increase in volume of imports is recent, sudden, sharp and significant.
The industry has not suffered and is not suffering significant overall impairment in its condition, 
i.e
., serious injury.
There is no threat of serious injury that is imminent from imports of gray Portland cement.
Causation has become moot and academic in view of the negative determination of the elements of serious injury and imminent threat of serious injury.
[23]
Accordingly, the Tariff Commission made the following recommendation, to wit:
The elements of serious injury and imminent threat of serious injury not having been established, it is hereby recommended that no definitive general safeguard measure be imposed on the importation of gray Portland cement.
[24]
The DTI received the Report on 14 March 2002. After reviewing the report, then DTI Secretary Manuel Roxas II (âDTI Secretaryâ) disagreed with the conclusion of the Tariff Commission that there was no serious injury to the local cement industry caused by the surge of imports.
[25]
 In view of this disagreement, the DTI requested an opinion from the Department of Justice (âDOJâ) on the DTI Secretaryâs scope of options in acting on the Commissionâs recommendations. Subsequently, then DOJ Secretary Hernando Perez rendered an opinion stating that Section 13 of the SMA precluded a review by the DTI Secretary of the Tariff Commissionâs negative finding, or finding that a definitive safeguard measure should not be imposed.
[26]
On 5 April 2002, the DTI Secretary promulgated a 
Decision
. After quoting the conclusions of the Tariff Commission, the DTI Secretary noted the DTIâs disagreement with the conclusions. However, he also cited the DOJ Opinion advising the DTI that it was bound by the negative finding of the Tariff Commission.  Thus, he ruled as follows:
The DTI has no alternative but to abide by the [Tariff] Commissionâs recommendations.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
, and in accordance with Section 13 of RA 8800 which states:
â
In the event of a negative final determination
; or if the cash bond is in excess of the definitive safeguard duty assessed, the Secretary shall immediately issue, through the Secretary of Finance, a written instruction to the Commissioner of Customs, authorizing the return of the cash bond or the remainder thereof, as the case may be, previously collected as provisional general safeguard measure within ten (10) days from the date a final decision has been made; Provided, that the government shall not be liable for any interest on the amount to be returned. The Secretary shall not accept for consideration another petition from the same industry, with respect to the same imports of the product under consideration within one (1) year after the date of rendering such a decision.â
The DTI hereby issues the following:
The application for safeguard measures against the importation of gray Portland cement filed by PHILCEMCOR (Case No. 02-2001) is hereby denied.
[27]
 (Emphasis in the original)
Philcemcor received a copy of the DTI 
Decision
 on 12 April 2002.  Ten days later, it filed with the Court of Appeals a 
Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus
[28]
 seeking to set aside the DTI 
Decision
, as well as the Tariff Commissionâs Report. Philcemcor likewise applied for a 
Temporary Restraining Order/Injunction
 to enjoin the DTI and the BOC from implementing the questioned 
Decision
 and Report.  It prayed that the Court of Appeals direct the DTI Secretary to disregard the Report and to render judgment independently of the Report.  Philcemcor argued that the DTI Secretary, vested as he is under the law with the power of review, is not bound to adopt the recommendations of the Tariff Commission; and, that the Report is void, as it is predicated on a flawed framework, inconsistent inferences and erroneous methodology.
[29]
On 10 June 2002, Southern Cross filed its 
Comment
.
[30]
 It argued that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction over Philcemcorâs 
Petition
, for it is on the Court of Tax Appeals (âCTAâ) that the SMA conferred jurisdiction to review rulings of the Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure.  It likewise argued that Philcemcorâs resort to the special civil action of certiorari is improper, considering that what Philcemcor sought to rectify is an error of judgment and not an error of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion,  and  that a petition for review with the CTA was available as a plain, speedy and adequate remedy. Finally, Southern Cross echoed the DOJ Opinion that Section 13 of the SMA precludes a review by the DTI Secretary of a negative finding of the Tariff Commission.
After conducting a hearing on 19 June 2002 on Philcemcorâs application for preliminary injunction, the Court of Appealsâ Twelfth Division
[31]
 granted the writ sought in its 
Resolution
 dated 21 June 2002.
[32]
 Seven days later, on 28 June 2002, the two-hundred (200)-day period for the imposition of the provisional measure expired. Despite the lapse of the period, the BOC continued to impose the provisional measure on all importations of Portland cement made by Southern Cross. The uninterrupted assessment of the tariff, according to Southern Cross, worked to its detriment to the point that the continued imposition would eventually lead to its closure.
[33]
Southern Cross timely filed a 
Motion for Reconsideration
 of the 
Resolution
 on 9 September 2002.  Alleging that Philcemcor was not entitled to provisional relief, Southern Cross likewise sought a clarificatory order as to whether the grant of the writ of preliminary injunction could extend the earlier imposition of the provisional measure beyond the two hundred (200)-day limit imposed by law. The appealsâ court failed to take immediate action on Southern Crossâs motion despite the four (4) motions for early resolution the latter filed between September of 2002 and February of 2003.  After six (6) months, on 19 February 2003, the Court of Appeals directed Philcemcor to comment on Southern Crossâs 
Motion for Reconsideration
.
[34]
 After Philcemcor filed its 
Opposition
[35]
 on 13 March 2003, Southern Cross filed another set of four (4) motions for early resolution.
Despite the efforts of Southern Cross, the Court of Appeals failed to directly resolve the 
Motion for Reconsideration
. Instead, on 5 June 2003, it rendered a 
Decision
,
[36]
 granting in part Philcemcorâs petition. The appellate court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the petition for certiorari since it alleged grave abuse of discretion.  It refused to annul the findings of the Tariff Commission, citing the rule that factual findings of administrative agencies are binding upon the courts and its corollary, that courts should not interfere in matters addressed to the sound discretion and coming under the special technical knowledge and training of such agencies.
[37]
  Nevertheless, it  held that the DTI Secretary is not bound by the factual findings of the Tariff Commission since such  findings are merely recommendatory and they fall within the ambit of the Secretaryâs discretionary review.  It determined that the legislative intent is to grant the DTI Secretary the power to make a final decision on the Tariff Commissionâs recommendation.
[38]
  The dispositive portion of the 
Decision
 reads:
WHEREFORE
, based on the foregoing premises, petitionerâs prayer to set aside the findings of the Tariff Commission in its assailed Report dated March 13, 2002 is 
DENIED
.  On the other hand, the assailed April 5, 2002 Decision of the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry is hereby 
SET ASIDE
.  Consequently, the case is 
REMANDED
 to the public respondent Secretary of Department of Trade and Industry for a final decision in accordance with RA 8800 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.
SO ORDERED
.
[39]
On 23 June 2003, Southern Cross filed the present petition, assailing the appellate courtâs 
Decision
 for departing from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, and not deciding the substantial questions in accordance with law and jurisprudence.  The petition argues in the main that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction over Philcemcorâs petition, the proper remedy being a petition for review with the CTA conformably with the SMA, and; that the factual findings of the Tariff Commission on the existence or non-existence conditions warranting the imposition of general safeguard measures are binding upon the DTI Secretary.
The timely filing of Southern Crossâs petition before this Court necessarily prevented the Court of Appeals 
Decision
 from becoming final.
[40]
 Yet on 25 June 2003, the DTI Secretary issued a new 
Decision
, ruling this time that that in light of the appellate courtâs 
Decision
 there was no longer any legal impediment to his deciding Philcemcorâs application for definitive safeguard measures.
[41]
 He made a determination that, contrary to the findings of the Tariff Commission, the local cement industry had suffered serious injury as a result of the import surges.
[42]
 Accordingly, he imposed a definitive safeguard measure on the importation of gray Portland cement, in the form of a definitive safeguard duty in the amount of 
P
20.60/40 kg. bag for three years on imported gray Portland Cement.
[43]
On 7 July 2003, Southern Cross filed with the Court a â
Very Urgent Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or A Writ of Preliminary Injunction
â (âTRO 
Application
â), seeking to enjoin the DTI Secretary from enforcing his 
Decision
 of 25 June 2003 in view of the pending petition before this Court.  Philcemcor filed an opposition, claiming, among others, that it is not this Court but the CTA that has jurisdiction over the application under the law.
On 1 August 2003, Southern Cross filed with the CTA a 
Petition for Review
, assailing the DTI Secretaryâs 25 June 2003 
Decision
 which imposed the definite safeguard measure. Prescinding from this action, Philcemcor filed with this Court a 
Manifestation and Motion to Dismiss
 in regard to Southern Crossâs petition, alleging that it deliberately and willfully resorted to forum-shopping.  It points out that Southern Crossâs TRO 
Application
 seeks to enjoin the DTI Secretaryâs second decision, while its 
Petition
 before the CTA prays for the annulment of the same decision.
[44]
Reiterating its 
Comment
 on Southern Crossâs 
Petition for Review
, Philcemcor also argues that the CTA, being a special court of limited jurisdiction, could only review the ruling of the DTI Secretary when a safeguard measure is imposed, and that the factual findings of the Tariff Commission are not binding on the DTI Secretary.
[45]
After giving due course to Southern Crossâs 
Petition
, the Court called the case for oral argument on 18 February 2004.
[46]
 At the oral argument, attended by the counsel for Philcemcor and Southern Cross and the Office of the Solicitor General, the Court simplified the issues in this wise: (i) whether the 
Decision
 of the DTI Secretary is appealable to the CTA or the Court of Appeals; (ii) assuming that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, whether its 
Decision
 is in accordance with law; and, (iii) whether a 
Temporary Restraining Order
 is warranted.
[47]
During the oral arguments, counsel for Southern Cross manifested that due to the imposition of the general safeguard measures, Southern Cross was forced to cease operations in the Philippines in November of 2003.
[48]
Propriety of the Temporary Restraining Order
Before the merits of the 
Petition
, a brief comment on Southern Crossâs application for provisional relief.  It sought to enjoin the DTI Secretary from enforcing the definitive safeguard measure he imposed in his 25 June 2003 
Decision
. The Court did not grant the provisional relief for it would be tantamount to enjoining the collection of taxes, a peremptory judicial act which is traditionally frowned upon,
[49]
 unless there is a clear statutory basis for it.
[50]
 In that regard, Section 218 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 prohibits any court from granting an injunction to restrain the collection of any national internal revenue tax, fee or charge imposed by the internal revenue code.
[51]
 A similar philosophy is expressed by Section 29 of the SMA, which states that the filing of a petition for review before the CTA does not stop, suspend, or otherwise toll the imposition or collection of  the appropriate tariff duties or the adoption of other appropriate safeguard measures.
[52]
 This evinces a clear legislative intent that the imposition of safeguard measures, despite the availability of judicial review, should not be enjoined notwithstanding any timely appeal of the imposition.
The Forum-Shopping Issue
In the same breath, we are not convinced that the allegation of forum-shopping has been duly proven, or that sanction should befall upon Southern Cross and its counsel. The standard by Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure in order that sanction may be had is that âthe acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping.â
[53]
 The standard implies a malicious intent to subvert procedural rules, and such state of mind is not evident in this case.
The Jurisdictional Issue
On to the merits of the present petition.
In its assailed 
Decision
, the Court of Appeals, after asserting only in brief that it had jurisdiction over Philcemcorâs 
Petition
, discussed the issue of whether or not the DTI Secretary is bound to adopt the negative recommendation of the Tariff Commission on the application for safeguard measure.  The Court of Appeals maintained that it had jurisdiction over the petition, as it alleged grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DTI Secretary, thus:
A perusal of the instant petition reveals allegations of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DTI Secretary in rendering the assailed April 5, 2002 Decision wherein it was ruled that he had no alternative but to abide by the findings of the Commission on the matter of safeguard measures for the local cement industry. Abuse of discretion is admittedly within the ambit of certiorari.
Grave abuse of discretion implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. It is alleged that, in the assailed Decision, the DTI Secretary gravely abused his discretion in wantonly evading to discharge his duty to render an independent determination or decision in imposing a definitive safeguard measure.
[54]
We do not doubt that the Court of Appealsâ certiorari powers extend to correcting grave abuse of discretion on the part of an officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.
[55]
 However, the special civil action of certiorari is available only when there is no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[56]
 Southern Cross relies on this limitation, stressing that Section 29 of the SMA is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law which Philcemcor did not avail of.  The Section reads:
Section 29. 
Judicial Review
. â Any interested party who is adversely affected by the 
ruling of the Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure
 may file with the CTA, a petition for review of such ruling within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof. Provided, 
however
, that the filing of such petition for review shall not in any way stop, suspend or otherwise toll the imposition or collection of the appropriate tariff duties or the adoption of other appropriate safeguard measures, as the case may be.
The petition for review shall comply with the same requirements and shall follow the same rules of procedure and shall be subject to the same disposition as in appeals in connection with adverse rulings on tax matters to the Court of Appeals.
[57]
 (Emphasis supplied)
It is not difficult to divine why the legislature singled out the CTA as the court with jurisdiction to review the ruling of the DTI Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure. The Court has long recognized the legislative determination to vest sole and exclusive jurisdiction on matters involving internal revenue and customs duties to such a specialized court.
[58]
 By the very nature of its function, the CTA is dedicated exclusively to the study and consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject.
[59]
At the same time, since the CTA is a court of limited jurisdiction, its jurisdiction to take cognizance of a case should be clearly conferred and should not be deemed to exist on mere implication.
[60]
 Concededly, Rep. Act No. 1125, the statute creating the CTA, does not extend to it the power to review decisions of the DTI Secretary in connection with the imposition of safeguard measures.
[61]
 Of course, at that time which was before the advent of trade liberalization the notion of safeguard measures or safety nets was not yet in vogue.
Undeniably, however, the SMA expanded the jurisdiction of the CTA by including review of the rulings of the DTI Secretary in connection with the imposition of safeguard measures.  However, Philcemcor and the public respondents agree that the CTA has appellate jurisdiction over a decision of the DTI Secretary imposing a safeguard measure, but not when his ruling is 
not
 to impose such measure.
In a related development, Rep. Act No. 9282, enacted on 30 March 2004, expressly vests unto the CTA jurisdiction over â[d]ecisions of the Secretary of Trade and Industry,  in case of nonagricultural product, commodity or article xxx involving xxx 
safeguard measures under Republic Act No. 8800, where either party may appeal the decision to impose or not to impose said duties
.â
[62]
 Had Rep. Act No. 9282 already been in force at the beginning of the incidents subject of this case, there would have been no need to make any deeper inquiry as to the extent of the CTAâs jurisdiction.  But as Rep. Act No. 9282 cannot be applied retroactively to the present case, the question of whether such jurisdiction extends to a decision not to impose a safeguard measure will have to be settled principally on the basis of the SMA.
Under Section 29 of the SMA, there are three requisites to enable the CTA to acquire jurisdiction over the petition for review contemplated therein: (i) there must be a ruling by the DTI Secretary; (ii) the petition must be filed by an interested party adversely affected by the ruling; and (iii) such ruling must be in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure. The first two requisites are clearly present.  The third requisite deserves closer scrutiny.
Contrary to the stance of the  public respondents and Philcemcor, in this case where  the DTI Secretary decides not to impose a safeguard measure,  it is the CTA which has jurisdiction to review his decision.  The reasons are as follows:
First
.  Split jurisdiction is abhorred.
Essentially, respondentsâ position is that judicial review of the DTI Secretaryâs ruling is exercised by two different courts, depending on whether or not it imposes a safeguard measure, and  in either case the court exercising jurisdiction does so to the exclusion of the other.  Thus, if the DTI decision involves the imposition of a safeguard measure it is the CTA which has appellate jurisdiction; otherwise, it is the Court of Appeals.  Such setup is as novel and unusual as it is cumbersome and unwise. Essentially, respondents advocate that Section 29 of the SMA has established split appellate jurisdiction over rulings of  the DTI Secretary on the imposition of safeguard measure.
This interpretation cannot be favored, as the Court has consistently refused to sanction split jurisdiction.
[63]
 The power of the DTI Secretary to adopt or withhold a safeguard measure emanates from the same statutory source, and it boggles the mind why the appeal modality would be such that one appellate court is qualified if what is to be reviewed is a positive determination, and it is not if what is appealed is a negative determination. In deciding whether or not to impose a safeguard measure, provisional or general, the DTI Secretary would be evaluating only one body of facts and applying them to one set of laws.  The reviewing tribunal will be called upon to examine the same facts and the same laws, whether or not the determination is positive or negative.
In short, if we were to rule for respondents we would be confirming the exercise by two judicial bodies of jurisdiction over basically the same subject matterÂ¾precisely the split-jurisdiction situation which is anathema to the orderly administration of justice.
[64]
 The Court cannot accept that such was the legislative motive especially considering that the law expressly confers on the CTA, the tribunal with the specialized competence over tax and tariff matters, the role of judicial review without mention of any other court that may exercise corollary or ancillary jurisdiction in relation to the SMA.  The provision refers to the Court of Appeals but only in regard to procedural rules and dispositions of appeals from the CTA to the Court of Appeals.
[65]
The principle enunciated in 
Tejada v. Homestead Property Corporation
[66]
 is applicable to the case at bar:
The Court agrees with the observation of the [that] when an administrative agency or body is conferred quasi-judicial functions, 
all controversies relating to the subject matter pertaining to its specialization are deemed to be included within the jurisdiction of said administrative agency or body. Split jurisdiction is not favored
.
[67]
Second
. The interpretation of the provisions of the SMA favors vesting untrammeled appellate jurisdiction on the CTA.
A plain reading of Section 29 of the SMA reveals that Congress did not expressly bar the CTA from reviewing a negative determination by the DTI Secretary nor conferred on the Court of Appeals such review authority.  Respondents note, on the other hand, that neither did the law expressly grant to the CTA the power to review a negative determination. However, under the clear text of the law, 
the CTA is vested with jurisdiction to review the ruling of the DTI Secretary â
in connection with
 the imposition of a safeguard measure.
â Had the law been couched instead to incorporate the phrase âthe ruling imposing a safeguard measure,â then respondentâs claim would have indisputable merit. Undoubtedly, the phrase âin connection withâ not only qualifies but clarifies the succeeding phrase âimposition of a safeguard measure.â As expounded later, the phrase also encompasses the opposite or converse ruling which is the non-imposition of a safeguard measure.
In the American case of 
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc
.,
[68]
 the United States Supreme Court, in interpreting a key provision of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, construed the phrase ârelates toâ in its normal sense which is the same as âif it has connection with or reference to.â
[69]
 There is no serious dispute that the phrase âin connection withâ is synonymous to ârelates toâ or âreference to,â and that all three phrases are broadly expansive. This is affirmed not just by jurisprudential fiat, but also the acquired connotative meaning of âin connection withâ in common parlance.  Consequently, with the use of the phrase âin connection with,â Section 29 allows the CTA to review not only the ruling imposing a safeguard measure, but all other 
rulings related or have reference to the application for such measure.
Now, let us determine the maximum scope and reach of the phrase âin connection withâ as used in Section 29 of the SMA.  A literalist reading or linguistic survey may not satisfy.  Even the US Supreme Court in 
New York State Blue Cross Plans v. Travelers Ins
.
[70]
 conceded that the phrases ârelate toâ or âin connection withâ may be extended to the farthest stretch of indeterminacy for, universally, relations or connections are infinite and stop nowhere.
[71]
 Thus, in the case the US High Court, examining the same phrase of the same provision of law involved in 
Shaw
, resorted to looking at the statute and its objectives as the alternative to an âuncritical literalism.â
[72]
 A similar inquiry into the other provisions of the SMA is in order to determine the scope of review accorded therein to the CTA.
[73]
The authority to decide on the safeguard measure is vested in the DTI Secretary in the case of non-agricultural products, and in the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture in the case of agricultural products.
[74]
 Section 29 is likewise explicit that only the rulings of the DTI Secretary or the Agriculture Secretary may be reviewed by the CTA.
[75]
 Thus, the acts of other bodies that were granted some powers by the SMA, such as the Tariff Commission, are not subject to direct review by the CTA.
Under the SMA, the Department Secretary concerned is authorized to decide on several matters. Within thirty (30) days from receipt of a petition seeking the imposition of a safeguard measure, or from the date he made 
motu proprio
 initiation, the Secretary shall make a preliminary determination on whether the increased imports of the product under consideration substantially cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry.
[76]
 Such ruling is crucial since only upon the Secretaryâs positive preliminary determination that a threat to the domestic industry exists shall the matter be referred to the Tariff Commission for formal investigation, this time, to determine whether the general safeguard measure should be imposed or not.
[77]
 Pursuant to a positive preliminary determination, the Secretary may also decide that the imposition of a provisional safeguard measure would be warranted under Section 8 of the SMA.
[78]
 The Secretary is also authorized to decide, after receipt of the report of the Tariff Commission, whether or not to impose the general safeguard measure, and if in the affirmative, what general safeguard measures should be applied.
[79]
 Even after the general safeguard measure is imposed, the Secretary is empowered to extend the safeguard measure,
[80]
 or terminate, reduce or modify his previous rulings on the general safeguard measure.
[81]
With the explicit grant of certain powers involving safeguard measures by the SMA on the DTI Secretary, it follows that he is empowered to rule on several issues.  These are the issues which arise in connection with, or in relation to, the imposition of a safeguard measure. They may arise at different stages â the preliminary investigation stage, the post-formal investigation stage, or the post-safeguard measure stage â yet all these issues do become ripe for resolution because an initiatory action has been taken seeking the imposition of a safeguard measure. It is the initiatory action for the imposition of a safeguard measure that sets the wheels in motion, allowing the Secretary to make successive rulings, beginning with the preliminary determination.
Clearly, therefore, the scope and reach of the phrase âin connection with,â as intended by Congress, pertain to 
all rulings of the DTI Secretary or Agriculture Secretary which arise from the time an application or 
motu proprio
 initiation for the imposition of a safeguard measure is taken
.  Indeed, the incidents which require resolution come to the fore only because there is an initial application or action seeking the imposition of a safeguard measure. From the legislative standpoint, it was a matter of sense and practicality to lump up the questions related to the initiatory application or action for safeguard measure and to assign only one court and; that is the CTA to initially review all the rulings related to such initiatory application or action.  Both directions Congress put in place by employing the phrase âin connection withâ in the law.
Given the relative expanse of decisions subject to judicial review by the CTA under Section 29, we do not doubt that a negative ruling refusing to impose a safeguard measure falls within the scope of its jurisdiction. On a literal level, such negative ruling is âa ruling of the Secretary in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure,â as it is one of the possible outcomes that may result from the initial application or action for a safeguard measure.  On a more critical level, the rulings of the DTI Secretary in connection with a safeguard measure, however diverse the outcome may be, arise from the same grant of jurisdiction on the DTI Secretary by the SMA.
[82]
 The refusal by the DTI Secretary to grant a safeguard measure involves the same grant of authority, the same statutory prescriptions, and the same degree of discretion as the imposition by the DTI Secretary of a safeguard measure.
The position of the respondents is one of âuncritical literalismâ
[83]
 incongruent with the animus of the law. Moreover, a fundamentalist approach to Section 29 is not warranted, considering the absurdity of the consequences.
Third. Interpretatio Talis In Ambiguis Semper Fienda Est, Ut Evitur Inconveniens Et Absurdum
.
[84]
Even assuming 
arguendo
 that Section 29 has not expressly granted the CTA jurisdiction to review a negative ruling of the DTI Secretary, the Court is precluded from favoring an interpretation that would cause inconvenience and absurdity.
[85]
 Adopting the respondentsâ position favoring the CTAâs minimal jurisdiction would unnecessarily lead to illogical and onerous results.
Indeed, it is illiberal to assume that Congress had intended to provide appellate relief to rulings imposing a safeguard measure but not to those declining to impose the measure. Respondents might argue that the right to relief from a negative ruling is not lost since the applicant could, as Philcemcor did, question such ruling through a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, in lieu of an appeal to the CTA. Yet these two reliefs are of differing natures and gravamen. While an appeal may be predicated on errors of fact or errors of law, a special civil action for certiorari is grounded on grave abuse of discretion or lack of or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decider. For a special civil action for certiorari to succeed, it is not enough that the questioned act of the respondent is wrong. As the Court clarified in 
Sempio v. Court of Appeals
:
A tribunal, board or officer acts without jurisdiction if it/he does not have the legal power to determine the case. There is excess of jurisdiction where, being clothed with the power to determine the case, the tribunal, board or officer oversteps its/his authority as determined by law. And there is grave abuse of discretion where the tribunal, board or officer acts in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of his judgment as to be said to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Certiorari is often resorted to in order to correct errors of jurisdiction. Where the error is one of law or of fact, which is a mistake of judgment, appeal is the remedy.
[86]
It is very conceivable that the DTI Secretary, after deliberate thought and careful evaluation of the evidence, may either make a negative preliminary determination as he is so empowered under Section 7 of the SMA, or refuse to adopt the definitive safeguard measure under Section 13 of the same law. Adopting the respondentsâ theory, this negative ruling is susceptible to reversal only through a special civil action for certiorari, thus depriving the affected party the chance to elevate the ruling on appeal on the rudimentary grounds of errors in fact or in law.  Instead, and despite whatever indications that the DTI Secretary acted with measure and within the bounds of his jurisdiction are, the aggrieved party will be forced to resort to a gymnastic exercise, contorting the straight and narrow in an effort to discombobulate the courts into believing that what was within was actually beyond and what was studied and deliberate actually whimsical and capricious. What then would be the remedy of the party aggrieved by a negative ruling that simply erred in interpreting the facts or the law? It certainly cannot be the special civil action for certiorari, for as the Court held in 
Silverio v. Court of Appeals
: âCertiorari is a remedy narrow in its scope and inflexible in its character. It is not a general utility tool in the legal workshop.â
[87]
Fortunately, this theoretical quandary need not come to pass.  Section 29 of the SMA is worded in such a way that it places  under the CTAâs judicial review all rulings of the DTI Secretary, which are connected with the imposition of a safeguard measure. This is sound and proper in light of the specialized jurisdiction of the CTA over tax matters. In the same way that a question of whether to tax or not to tax is properly a tax matter, so is the question of whether to impose or not to impose a definitive safeguard measure.
On another note, the second paragraph of Section 29 similarly reveals the legislative intent that rulings of the DTI Secretary over safeguard measures should first be reviewed by the CTA and not the Court of Appeals.  It reads:
The petition for review shall comply with the same requirements and shall follow the same rules of procedure and shall be subject to the same disposition as in appeals in connection with adverse rulings on tax matters to the Court of Appeals.
This is the only passage in the SMA in which the Court of Appeals is mentioned. The express wish of Congress is that the petition conform to the requirements and procedure under Rule 43 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Since Congress mandated that the form and procedure adopted be analogous to a review of a CTA ruling by the Court of Appeals, the legislative contemplation could not have been that the appeal be directly taken to the Court of Appeals.
Issue of Binding Effect of Tariff
Commissionâs Factual Determination
on DTI Secretary.
The next issue for resolution is whether the factual determination made by the Tariff Commission under the SMA is binding on the DTI Secretary.  Otherwise stated, the question is whether the DTI Secretary may impose general safeguard measures in the absence of a positive final determination by the Tariff Commission.
The Court of Appeals relied upon Section 13 of the SMA in ruling that the findings of the Tariff Commission do not necessarily constitute a final decision.  Section 13 details the procedure for the adoption of a safeguard measure, as well as the steps to be taken in case there is a negative final determination.  The implication of the Court of Appealsâ holding is that the DTI Secretary may adopt a definitive safeguard measure, notwithstanding a negative determination made by the Tariff Commission.
Undoubtedly, Section 13 prescribes certain limitations and restrictions before general safeguard measures may be imposed. However, 
the most fundamental restriction on the DTI Secretaryâs power in that respect is contained in Section 5 of the SMAÂ¾that there should first be a positive final determination of the Tariff Commission
Â¾which the Court of Appeals curiously all but ignored.  Section 5 reads:
Sec. 5. 
Conditions for the Application of General Safeguard Measures
. â The Secretary 
shall apply a general safeguard measure upon a positive final determination of the [Tariff] Commission
 that a product is being imported into the country in increased quantities, whether absolute or relative to the domestic production, as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry; however, in the case of non-agricultural products, the Secretary shall first establish that the application of such safeguard measures will be in the public interest. (emphasis supplied)
The plain meaning of Section 5 shows that it is the Tariff Commission that has the power to make a âpositive final determination.â This power lodged in the Tariff Commission, must be distinguished from the power to impose the general safeguard measure which is properly vested on the DTI Secretary.
[88]
All in all, there are two condition precedents that must be satisfied before the DTI Secretary may impose a general safeguard measure on grey Portland cement. First, there must be a positive final determination by the Tariff Commission that a product is being imported into the country in increased quantities (whether absolute or relative to domestic production), as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat to the domestic industry. Second, in the case of non-agricultural products the Secretary must establish that the application of such safeguard measures is in the public interest.
[89]
 As Southern Cross argues, Section 5 is quite clear-cut, and it is impossible to finagle a different conclusion even through overarching methods of statutory construction. There is no safer nor better settled canon of interpretation that when language is clear and unambiguous it must be held to mean what it plainly expresses:
[90]
 In the quotable words of an illustrious member of this Court, thus:
[I]f a statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation. The 
verba legis
 or plain meaning rule rests on the valid presumption that the words employed by the legislature in a statute correctly express its intent or will and preclude the court from construing it differently. The legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by the use of such words as are found in the statute.
[91]
Moreover, Rule 5 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the SMA,
[92]
 which interprets Section 5 of the law, likewise requires a positive final determination on the part of the Tariff Commission before the application of the general safeguard measure.
The SMA establishes a distinct allocation of functions between the Tariff Commission and the DTI Secretary. The plain meaning of Section 5 shows that it is the Tariff Commission that has the power to make a âpositive final determination.â This power, which belongs to the Tariff Commission, must be distinguished from the power to impose general safeguard measure properly vested on the DTI Secretary. The distinction is vital, as a âpositive final determinationâ clearly antecedes, as a condition precedent, the imposition of a general safeguard measure.  At the same time, a positive final determination does not necessarily result in the imposition of a general safeguard measure.  Under Section 5, notwithstanding the positive final determination of the Tariff Commission, the DTI Secretary is tasked to decide whether or not that the application of the safeguard measures is in the public interest.
It is also clear from Section 5 of the SMA that the positive final determination to be undertaken by the Tariff Commission does not entail a mere gathering of statistical data. In order to arrive at such determination, it has to establish causal linkages from the statistics that it compiles and evaluates: after finding there is an importation in increased quantities of the product in question, that such importation is a substantial cause of serious threat or injury to the domestic industry.
The Court of Appeals relies heavily on the legislative record of a congressional debate during deliberations on the SMA to assert a purported legislative intent that the findings of the Tariff Commission do not bind the DTI Secretary.
[93]
 Yet as explained earlier, the plain meaning of Section 5 emphasizes that only if the Tariff Commission renders a positive determination could the DTI Secretary impose a safeguard measure.  Resort to the congressional records to ascertain legislative intent is not warranted if a statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity. The legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by the use of such words as are found in the statute.
[94]
Indeed, the legislative record, if at all to be availed of, should be approached with extreme caution, as legislative debates and proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the statute when the meaning is clear.
[95]
 Our holding in 
Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary
[96]
 on the resort to deliberations of the constitutional convention to interpret the Constitution is likewise appropriate in ascertaining statutory intent:
While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is clear. Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk xxx. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face.â
[97]
Moreover, it is easy to selectively cite passages, sometimes out of their proper context, in order to assert a misleading interpretation. The effect can be dangerous. Minority or solitary views, anecdotal ruminations, or even the occasional crude witticisms, may improperly acquire the mantle of legislative intent by the sole virtue of their publication in the authoritative congressional record. Hence, resort to legislative deliberations is allowable when the statute is crafted in such a manner as to leave room for doubt on the real intent of the legislature.
Section 5 plainly evinces legislative intent to restrict the DTI Secretaryâs power to impose a general safeguard measure by preconditioning such imposition on a positive determination by the Tariff Commission. Such legislative intent should be given full force and effect, as the executive power to impose definitive safeguard measures is but a delegated powerÂ¾the power of taxation, by nature and by command of the fundamental law, being a preserve of the legislature.
[98]
 Section 28(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution confirms the delegation of legislative power, yet ensures that the prerogative of Congress to impose limitations and restrictions on the executive exercise of this power:
The Congress may, by law, authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government.
[99]
The safeguard measures which the DTI Secretary may impose under the SMA may take the following variations, to wit: (a) an increase in, or imposition of any duty on the imported product; (b) a decrease in or the imposition of a tariff-rate quota on the product; (c) a modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of the product into the Philippines; (d) one or more appropriate adjustment measures, including the provision of trade adjustment assistance; and (e) any combination of the above-described actions. Except for the provision of trade adjustment assistance, the measures enumerated by the SMA are essentially imposts, which precisely are the subject of delegation under Section 28(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution.
[100]
This delegation of the taxation power by the legislative to the executive is authorized by the Constitution itself.
[101]
 At the same time, the Constitution also grants the delegating authority (Congress) the right to impose restrictions and limitations on the taxation power delegated to the President.
[102]
 The restrictions and limitations imposed by Congress take on the mantle of a constitutional command, which the executive branch is obliged to observe.
The SMA empowered the DTI Secretary, as 
alter ego
 of the President,
[103]
 to impose definitive general safeguard measures, which basically are tariff imposts of the type spoken of in the Constitution.  However, the law did not grant him full, uninhibited discretion to impose such measures.  The DTI Secretary authority is derived  from the SMA; it does not  flow from any inherent executive power.  Thus, the limitations imposed by Section 5 are absolute, warranted as they are by a constitutional fiat.
[104]
Philcemcor cites our 1912 ruling in 
Lamb v. Phipps
[105]
 to assert that the DTI Secretary, having the final decision on the safeguard measure, has the power to evaluate the findings of the Tariff Commission and make an independent judgment thereon. Given the constitutional and statutory limitations governing the present case, the citation is misplaced.  
Lamb
 pertained to the discretion of the Insular Auditor of the Philippine Islands, whom, as the Court recognized, â[t]he statutes of the United States require[d] xxx to exercise his judgment upon the legality xxx [of] provisions of law and resolutions of Congress providing for the payment of money, the means of procuring testimony upon which he may act.â
[106]
Thus in 
Lamb
, while the Court recognized the wide latitude of discretion that may have been vested on the Insular Auditor, it also recognized that such latitude flowed from, and is consequently limited by, statutory grant. However, in this case, the provision of the Constitution in point expressly recognizes the authority of Congress to prescribe limitations in the case of tariffs, export/import quotas and other such safeguard measures. Thus, the broad discretion granted to the Insular Auditor of the Philippine Islands cannot be analogous to the discretion of the DTI Secretary which is circumscribed by Section 5 of the SMA.
For that matter, 
CariÃ±o v. Commissioner on Human Rights
,
[107]
 likewise cited by Philcemcor, is also inapplicable owing to the different statutory regimes prevailing over that case and the present petition.  In 
CariÃ±o
, the Court ruled that the constitutional power of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to investigate human rightsâ violations did not extend to adjudicating claims on the merits.
[108]
 Philcemcor claims that the functions of the Tariff Commission being âonly investigatory,â it could neither decide nor adjudicate.
[109]
The applicable law governing the issue in 
CariÃ±o
 is Section 18, Article XIII of the Constitution, which delineates the powers and functions of the CHR. The provision does not vest on the CHR the power to adjudicate cases, but only to investigate all forms of human rights violations.
[110]
 Yet, without modifying the thorough disquisition of the Court in 
CariÃ±o
 on the general limitations on the investigatory power, the precedent is inapplicable  because of the difference in the involved statutory frameworks. The Constitution does not repose binding effect on the results of the CHRâs investigation.
[111]
 On the other hand, through Section 5 of the SMA and under the authority of Section 28(2), Article VI of the Constitution, Congress did intend to bind the DTI Secretary to the determination made by the Tariff Commission.
[112]
 It is of no consequence that such determination results from the exercise of investigatory powers by the Tariff Commission since Congress is well within its constitutional mandate to limit the authority of the DTI Secretary to impose safeguard measures in the manner that it sees fit.
The Court of Appeals and Philcemcor also rely on Section 13 of the SMA and Rule 13 of the SMAâs Implementing Rules in support of the view that the DTI Secretary may decide independently of the determination made by the Tariff Commission. Admittedly, there are certain infelicities in the language of Section 13 and Rule 13. But reliance should not be placed on the textual imprecisions.  Rather, Section 13 and Rule 13 must be viewed in light of the fundamental prescription imposed by Section 5. 
[113]
Section 13 of the SMA lays down the procedure to be followed after the Tariff Commission renders its report. The provision reads in full:
SEC. 13. 
Adoption of Definitive Measures
. â Upon its positive determination, the Commission shall recommend to the Secretary an appropriate definitive measure, in the form of:
An increase in, or imposition of, any duty on the imported product;
A decrease in or the imposition of a tariff-rate quota (MAV) on the product;
A modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of the product into the Philippines;
One or more appropriate adjustment measures, including the provision of trade adjustment assistance;
Any combination of  actions described in subparagraphs (a) to (d).
The Commission may also recommend other actions, including the initiation of international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase of imports of the product, to alleviate the injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry, and to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.
The general safeguard measure shall be limited to the extent of redressing or preventing the injury and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry from the adverse effects directly attributed to the increased imports:  
Provided, however,
 That when quantitative import restrictions are used, such measures shall not reduce the quantity of imports below the average imports for the three (3) preceding representative years, unless clear justification is given that a different level is necessary to prevent or remedy a serious injury.
A general safeguard measure shall not be applied to a product originating from a developing country if its share of total imports of the product is less than three percent (3%): 
Provided, however
, That developing countries with less than three percent (3%) share collectively account for not more than nine percent (9%) of the total imports.
The decision imposing a general safeguard measure, the duration of which is more than one (1) year, shall be reviewed at regular intervals for purposes of liberalizing or reducing its intensity. The industry benefiting from the application of a general safeguard measure shall be required to show positive adjustment within the allowable period.  A general safeguard measure shall be terminated where the benefiting industry fails to show any improvement, as may be determined by the Secretary.
The Secretary shall issue a written instruction to the heads of the concerned government agencies to implement the appropriate general safeguard measure as determined by the Secretary within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the report.
In the event of a negative final determination, or if the cash bond is in excess of the definitive safeguard duty assessed, the Secretary shall immediately issue, through the Secretary of Finance, a written instruction to the Commissioner of Customs, authorizing the return of the cash bond or the remainder thereof, as the case may be, previously collected as provisional general safeguard measure within ten (10) days from the date a final decision has been made:  
Provided
, That the government shall not be liable for any interest on the amount to be returned. The Secretary shall not accept for consideration another petition from the same industry, with respect to the same imports of the product under consideration within one (1) year after the date of rendering such a decision.
When the definitive safeguard measure is in the form of a tariff increase, such increase shall not be subject or limited to the maximum levels of tariff as set forth in Section 401(a) of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines.
To better comprehend Section 13, note must be taken of the distinction between the investigatory and recommendatory functions of the Tariff Commission under the SMA.
The word âdetermination,â as used in the SMA, pertains to the factual findings on whether there are increased imports into the country of the product under consideration, and on whether such increased imports are a substantial cause of serious injury or threaten to substantially cause serious injury to the domestic industry.
[114]
 The SMA explicitly authorizes the DTI Secretary to make a preliminary determination,
[115]
 and the Tariff Commission to make the final determination.
[116]
 The distinction is fundamental, as these functions are not interchangeable. The Tariff Commission makes its determination only after a formal investigation process, with such investigation initiated only if there is a positive preliminary determination by the DTI Secretary under Section 7 of the SMA.
[117]
  On the other hand, the DTI Secretary may impose definitive safeguard measure only if there is a positive final determination made by the Tariff Commission.
[118]
In contrast, a ârecommendationâ is a suggested remedial measure submitted by the Tariff Commission under  Section 13 after making a positive final determination in accordance with Section 5. The Tariff Commission is not empowered to make a recommendation absent a positive final determination on its part.
[119]
 Under Section 13, the Tariff Commission is required to recommend to the [DTI] Secretary an âappropriate definitive measure.â
[120]
 The Tariff Commission âmay also recommend other actions, including the initiation of international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase of imports of the products, to alleviate the injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry and to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.â
[121]
The recommendations of the Tariff Commission, as rendered under Section 13, are not obligatory on the DTI Secretary. Nothing in the SMA mandates the DTI Secretary to adopt the recommendations made by the Tariff Commission.  In fact, the SMA requires that the DTI Secretary establish that the application of such safeguard measures is in the public interest, notwithstanding the Tariff Commissionâs  recommendation on the appropriate safeguard measure based on its positive final determination.
[122]
 The non-binding force of the Tariff Commissionâs recommendations is congruent with the command of Section 28(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution that only the President may be empowered by the Congress to impose appropriate tariff rates, import/export quotas and other similar measures.
[123]
 It is the DTI Secretary, as 
alter ego
 of the President, who under the SMA may impose such safeguard measures subject to the limitations imposed therein.  A contrary conclusion would in essence unduly arrogate to the Tariff Commission the executive power to impose the appropriate tariff measures. That is why the SMA empowers the DTI Secretary to adopt safeguard measures other than those recommended by the Tariff Commission.
Unlike the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, its determination has a different effect on the DTI Secretary.  Only on the basis of a positive final determination made by the Tariff Commission under Section 5 can the DTI Secretary impose a general safeguard measure.  Clearly, then the DTI Secretary is 
bound by the determination
 made by the Tariff Commission.
Some confusion may arise because the sixth paragraph of Section 13
[124]
 uses the variant word âdeterminedâ in a different context, as it contemplates âthe appropriate general safeguard measure as determined by the Secretary within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the report.â Quite plainly, the word âdeterminedâ in this context pertains to the DTI Secretaryâs power of choice of the appropriate safeguard measure, as opposed to the Tariff Commissionâs power to determine the existence of conditions necessary for the imposition of any safeguard measure.  In relation to Section 5, such choice also relates to the mandate of the DTI Secretary to establish that the application of safeguard measures is in the public interest, also within the fifteen (15) day period. Nothing in Section 13 contradicts the instruction in Section 5 that the DTI Secretary is allowed to impose the general safeguard measures only if there is a positive determination made by the Tariff Commission.
Unfortunately, Rule 13.2 of the Implementing Rules of the SMA is captioned âFinal Determination by the Secretary.â The assailed 
Decision
 and Philcemcor latch on this phraseology to imply that the factual determination rendered by the Tariff Commission under Section 5 may be amended or reversed by the DTI Secretary. Of course, implementing rules should conform, not clash, with the law that they seek to implement,  for  a  regulation  which  operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute is a nullity.
[125]
 Yet imperfect draftsmanship aside, nothing in Rule 13.2 implies that the DTI Secretary can set aside the determination made by the Tariff Commission under the aegis of Section 5. This can be seen by examining the specific provisions of Rule 13.2, thus:
RULE 13.2.  Final Determination by the Secretary
RULE 13.2.a.  Within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the Report of the Commission, the Secretary shall make a decision, taking into consideration the measures recommended by the Commission.
RULE 13.2.b.  
If the determination is affirmative
, the Secretary shall issue, within two (2) calendar days after making his decision, a written instruction to the heads of the concerned government agencies to immediately implement the appropriate general safeguard measure as determined by him.  Provided, however, that in the case of non-agricultural products, the Secretary shall first establish that the imposition of the safeguard measure will be in the public interest.
RULE 13.2.c.  Within two (2) calendar days after making his decision, the Secretary shall also order its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation. He shall also furnish a copy of his Order to the petitioner and other interested parties, whether affirmative or negative.  (Emphasis supplied.)
Moreover, the DTI Secretary does not have the power to review the findings of the Tariff Commission for it is not subordinate to the Department of Trade and Industry (âDTIâ).  It falls under the supervision, not of the DTI nor of the Department of Finance (as mistakenly asserted by Southern Cross),
[126]
 but of the 
National Economic Development Authority, an independent planning agency of the government of co-equal rank as the DTI
.
[127]
 As the supervision and control of a Department Secretary is limited to the bureaus, offices, and agencies under him,
[128]
 the DTI Secretary generally cannot exercise review authority over actions of the Tariff Commission. Neither does the SMA specifically authorize the DTI Secretary to alter, amend or modify in any way the determination made by the Tariff Commission. The most that the DTI Secretary could do to express displeasure over the Tariff Commissionâs actions is to ignore its recommendation, but not its determination.
The word âdeterminationâ as used in Rule 13.2 of the Implementing Rules is dissonant with the same word as employed in the SMA, which in the latter case is undeviatingly in reference to the determination made by the Tariff Commission. Beyond the resulting confusion, however, the divergent use in Rule 13.2 is explicable as the Rule textually pertains to the power of the DTI Secretary to review the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, not the latterâs determination. Indeed, an examination of the specific provisions show that there is no real conflict to reconcile. Rule 13.2 respects the logical order imposed by the SMA.  The Rule does not remove the essential requirement under Section 5 that a positive final determination be made by the Tariff Commission before a definitive safeguard measure may be imposed by the DTI Secretary.
The assailed 
Decision
 characterizes the findings of the Tariff Commission as merely recommendatory and points to the DTI Secretary as the authority who renders the final decision.
[129]
 At the same time, Philcemcor asserts that the Tariff Commissionâs functions are merely investigatory, and as such do not include the power to decide or adjudicate. These contentions, viewed in the context of the fundamental requisite set forth by Section 5, are untenable.  They run counter to the statutory prescription that a positive final determination made by the Tariff Commission should first be obtained before the definitive safeguard measures may be laid down.
Was it anomalous for Congress to have provided for a system whereby the Tariff Commission may preclude the  DTI, an office of higher rank, from imposing a safeguard measure? Of course, this Court does not inquire into the wisdom of the legislature but only charts the boundaries of powers and functions set in its enactments.  But then, it is not difficult to see the internal logic of this statutory framework.
For one, as earlier stated, the DTI cannot exercise review powers over the Tariff Commission which is not its subordinate office.
Moreover, the mechanism established by Congress establishes a measure of check and balance involving two different governmental agencies with disparate specializations.  The matter of safeguard measures is of such national importance that a decision either to impose or not to impose then could have ruinous effects on companies doing business in the Philippines.  Thus, it is ideal to put in place a system which affords all due deliberation and calls to fore various governmental agencies exercising their particular specializations.
Finally, if this arrangement drawn up by Congress makes it difficult to obtain a general safeguard measure, it is because such safeguard measure is the exception, rather than the rule. The Philippines is obliged to observe its obligations under the GATT, under whose framework trade liberalization, not protectionism, is laid down. Verily, the GATT actually prescribes conditions before a member-country may impose a safeguard measure. The pertinent portion of the GATT Agreement on Safeguards reads:
A Member may only apply a safeguard measure to a product only if that member has determined, pursuant to the provisions set out below, that such product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive products.
[130]
(a) A Member may apply a safeguard measure only following an investigation by the competent authorities of that Member pursuant to procedures previously established and made public in consonance with Article X of the GATT 1994. This investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which importers, exporters and other interested parties could present evidence and their views, including the opportunity to respond to the presentations of other parties and to submit their views, 
inter alia
, as to whether or not the application of a safeguard measure would be in the public interest. The competent authorities shall publish a report setting forth their findings and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law.
[131]
The SMA was designed not to contradict the GATT, but to complement it. The two requisites laid down in Section 5 for a positive final determination are the same conditions provided under the GATT Agreement on Safeguards for the application of safeguard measures by a member country. Moreover, the investigatory procedure laid down by the SMA conforms to the procedure required by the GATT Agreement on Safeguards. Congress has chosen the Tariff Commission as the competent authority to conduct such investigation. Southern Cross stresses that applying the provision of the GATT Agreement on Safeguards, the Tariff Commission is clearly empowered to arrive at binding conclusions.
[132]
 We agree: binding on the DTI Secretary is the Tariff Commissionâs determinations on whether a product is imported in increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production and whether any such increase is a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry.
[133]
Satisfied as we are with the proper statutory paradigm within which the SMA should be analyzed, the flaws in the reasoning of the Court of Appeals and in the arguments of the respondents become apparent.  To better understand the dynamics of the procedure set up by the law leading to the imposition of definitive safeguard measures, a brief step-by-step recount thereof is in order.
After the initiation of an action involving a general safeguard measure,
[134]
 the DTI Secretary makes a preliminary determination whether the increased imports of the product under consideration substantially cause or threaten to substantially cause serious injury to the domestic industry,
[135]
 and whether the imposition of a provisional measure is warranted under Section 8 of the SMA.
[136]
 If the preliminary determination is negative, it is implied that no further action will be taken on the application.
When his preliminary determination is positive, the Secretary immediately transmits the records covering the application to the Tariff Commission for immediate formal investigation.
[137]
The Tariff Commission conducts its formal investigation, keyed towards making a final determination. In the process, it holds public hearings, providing interested parties the opportunity to present evidence or otherwise be heard.
[138]
 To repeat, Section 5 enumerates what the Tariff Commission is tasked to determine: (a) whether a product is being imported into the country in increased quantities, irrespective of whether the product is absolute or relative to the domestic production; and (b) whether the importation in increased quantities is such  that it causes serious injury or threat to the domestic industry.
[139]
 The findings of the Tariff Commission as to these matters constitute the final determination, which may be either positive or negative.
Under Section 13 of the SMA, if the Tariff Commission makes a positive determination, the Tariff Commission ârecommends to the [DTI] Secretary an appropriate definitive measure.â The Tariff Commission âmay also recommend other actions, including the initiation of international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase of imports of the products, to alleviate the injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry, and to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.â
[140]
If the Tariff Commission makes a positive final determination, the DTI Secretary is then to decide, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the report, as to what appropriate safeguard measures should he impose.
However, if the Tariff Commission makes a negative final determination, the DTI Secretary cannot impose any definitive safeguard measure. Under Section 13, he is instructed instead to return whatever cash bond was paid by the applicant upon the initiation of the action for safeguard measure.
The Effect of the Courtâs Decision
The Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case back to the DTI Secretary, with the instruction that the DTI Secretary may impose a general safeguard measure even if there is no positive final determination from the Tariff Commission.  More crucially, the Court of Appeals could not have acquired jurisdiction over Philcemcorâs petition for certiorari in the first place, as Section 29 of the SMA properly vests jurisdiction on the CTA. Consequently, the assailed 
Decision
 is an absolute nullity, and we declare it as such.
What is the effect of the nullity of the assailed 
Decision
 on the 5 June 2003 
Decision
 of the DTI Secretary imposing the general safeguard measure? We have recognized that any initial judicial review of a DTI ruling in connection with the imposition of a safeguard measure belongs to the CTA. At the same time, the Court also recognizes the fundamental principle that a null and void judgment cannot produce any legal effect.  There is sufficient cause to establish that the 5 June 2003 
Decision
 of the DTI Secretary resulted from the assailed Court of Appeals 
Decision
, even if the latter had not yet become final. Conversely, it can be concluded that it was because of the putative imprimatur of the Court of Appealsâ 
Decision
 that the DTI Secretary issued his ruling imposing the safeguard measure.  Since the 5 June 2003 
Decision
 derives its legal effect from the void 
Decision
 of the Court of Appeals, this ruling of the DTI Secretary is consequently void.  
The spring cannot rise higher than the source.
The DTI Secretary himself acknowledged that he drew stimulating force from the appellate courtâs 
Decision
 for in his own 5 June 2003 
Decision
, he declared:
From the aforementioned ruling, the CA has remanded the case to the DTI Secretary for a final decision. Thus, there is no legal impediment for the Secretary to decide on the application.
[141]
The inescapable conclusion is that the DTI Secretary needed the assailed 
Decision
 of the Court of Appeals to justify his rendering a second 
Decision
.  He explicitly invoked the Court of Appealsâ 
Decision
 as basis for rendering his 5 June 2003 ruling, and implicitly recognized that without such 
Decision
 he would not have the authority to revoke his previous ruling and render a new, obverse ruling.
It is clear then that the 25 June 2003 
Decision
 of the DTI Secretary is a product of the void 
Decision
, it being an attempt to carry out such null judgment. There is therefore no choice but to declare it void as well, lest we sanction the perverse existence of a fruit from a non-existent tree. It does not even matter what the disposition of the 25 June 2003 
Decision
 was, its nullity would be warranted even if the DTI Secretary chose to uphold his earlier ruling denying the application for safeguard measures.
It is also an unfortunate spectacle to behold the DTI Secretary, seeking to enforce a judicial decision which is not yet final and actually pending review on appeal. Had it been a judge who attempted to enforce a decision that is not yet final and executory, he or she would have readily been subjected to sanction by this Court. The DTI Secretary may be beyond the ambit of administrative review by this Court, but we are capacitated to allocate the boundaries set by the law of the land and to exact fealty to the legal order, especially from the instrumentalities and officials of government.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed 
Decision
 of the Court of Appeals is DECLARED NULL AND VOID and SET ASIDE.  The 
Decision
 of the DTI Secretary dated 25 June 2003 is also DECLARED NULL AND VOID and SET ASIDE.  No Costs.

 The Tariff Commission concluded that while the market share of the domestic industry (
i.e
., the applicant-companies) had declined from almost 99% in 1998 to 80% in 2001, the local industry remained the significantly dominant market player. 
Id
. at 290-291.
[19]
 The Report determined that while domestic sales of the applicant-companies had declined since 1998, such decline was offset by an increase in export sales volume. The domestic industry likewise suffered a decline in production in the year 2000, when imports started to surge, at a rate of 5% from the previous year, yet such decline was not sharp nor significant enough relative to the years prior to the surge to constitute serious impairment in the production and sales of the industry.  
Id
. at 292.
[20]
 Anent the applicant-companies, it was found that while industry capacity utilization declined from 1996 to 1999, the decline was actually arrested in 2000, the year imports surged. Capacity utilization did decline in the first three quarters of 2001 relative to the same period in 2000, yet such decline was not sudden, sharp, nor significant enough in the contemplation of the law as to constitute serious impairment of the industryâs overall condition. 
Id
. at 294.
[21]
 It was determined that total sales revenues of the applicant companies in the year 2000, when imports surged, had actually peaked at 
P
25.97 billion pesos, the highest level in at least five years. The applicant-companiesâ income from operations had likewise registered a profit of 
P
1.98 billion in 2000, representing an upturn of 175.51% from 1999, before imports surged, when a total loss of 
P
2.62 billion was incurred by these companies. 
Id
. at 296.
[22]
 According to the Tariff Commission, a negative return on sales of the applicant-companies was registered in 1999, when imports had not yet surged, due to a deficit from operations of 
P
2.62 billion in 1999.  However, as imports surged in 2000, the applicant-companies had registered a positive return of 7.62%, as operating income of P1.98 billion was realized for that year.

Decision
, Southern Cross was already apprehensive that the DTI Secretary might act favorably on Philcemcorâs petition in light of the Court of Appeals ruling. Southern Cross sent a letter dated 19 June 2003 to DTI Secretary Roxas, informing him that Southern Cross would be appealing the Court of Appeals Decision to the Supreme Court, and that â[w]e trust that, in accordance with the Rules of Court, you will refrain from assuming jurisdiction or from taking any action on the Application for Safeguard Measures filed by Philcemcor until after the Supreme Court shall have finally decided on our appeal xxx.â  
See Rollo
, pp. 679-680.
[42]
 Among the factors cited by the DTI as basis for holding that there was serious injury was the decline in sales volumes during the period of the import surge, sales volume decreasing by 11.72% in 2000, and by 13.28% during the first three quarters of 2001. It also cited the decline in the domestic industryâs market share from 98.60% in 1998 to 79.23% in 2001, representing a 20% drop. The import surge had also caused the idling of seven (7) dry kilns, a decline in actual production of the domestic industry by 7.2% from 1998 to 2001; a decrease in capacity utilization; and net losses to the domestic industry amounting to around P7.7 billion in 1999 and P5.5 billion in 2000.

[44]
 There is a certain novelty to Philcemcorâs claim, considering that the purported common identity of causes of action arose not with the filing of the initiatory pleading, but with the ancillary action for injunction. We do not doubt that forum-shopping can be committed even if the identical relief or cause of action is sought or asserted before a different forum not in the initiatory pleading, but in an application for provisional relief. Forum-shopping is frowned upon as it affords the litigant the opportunity to avail of the same relief based on the same cause of action before different jurisdictions. For so long as the courts or tribunals are capacitated to grant the reliefs sought, the mode through which the redress is sought becomes immaterial.

 The distinction must also be laid between the power of the DTI Secretary to impose a provisional safeguard measure under Section 8 of the SMA and a general safeguard measure under Section 13. Under Section 8, the decision to impose a provisional safeguard measure is clearly within the sole discretion of the DTI Secretary, without need to take into account what other governmental agencies may say. Yet under Section 13, in relation to Section 8 of the SMA, the decision by the DTI Secretary to impose the general safeguard measure is indubitably predicated on a positive final determination by the Tariff Commission.
