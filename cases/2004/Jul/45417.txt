RICARDO S. INDING, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.


D E C I S I O N




CALLEJO, SR., J.:


This is a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure for the nullification of the September 23, 1999 Resolution
[1]
 of the Sandiganbayan (Second Division), which denied the petitionerâs omnibus motion with supplemental motion, and its Resolution dated April 25, 2000, denying the petitionerâs motion for the reconsideration of the same.
The Antecedents
On January 27, 1999, an Information was filed with the Sandiganbayan charging petitioner Ricardo S. Inding, a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Dapitan City, with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019,
[2]
 committed as follows:
That from the period 3 January 1997 up to 9 August 1997 and for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Dapitan City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Ricardo S. Inding, a high-ranking public officer, being a Councilor of Dapitan City and as such, while in the performance of his official functions, particularly in the operation against drug abuse, with evident bad faith and manifest partiality, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally, faked buy-bust operations against alleged pushers or users to enable him to claim or collect from the coffers of the city government a total amount of 
P
30,500.00, as reimbursement for actual expenses incurred during the alleged buy-bust operations, knowing fully well that he had no participation in the said police operations against drugs but enabling him to collect from the coffers of the city government a total amount of 
P
30,500.00, thereby causing undue injury to the government as well as the public interest.
[3]
The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 25116 and raffled to the Second Division of the Sandiganbayan.
On June 2, 1999, the petitioner filed an Omnibus Motion
[4]
 for the dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction over the officers charged or, in the alternative, for the referral of the case either to the Regional Trial Court or the Municipal Trial Court for appropriate proceedings.  The petitioner alleged therein that under Administrative Order No. 270 which prescribes the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991, he is a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Dapitan City with Salary Grade (SG) 25.  He asserted that under Republic Act No. 7975, which amended Presidential Decree No. 1606, the Sandiganbayan exercises original jurisdiction to try cases involving crimes committed by officials of local government units only if such officials occupy positions with SG 27 or higher, based on Rep. Act No. 6758, otherwise known as the âCompensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.â He contended that under Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, the RTC, not the Sandiganbayan, has original jurisdiction over the crime charged against him.  The petitioner urged the trial court to take judicial notice of Adm. Order No. 270.
In its comment on the omnibus motion, the Office of the Special Prosecutor asserted that the petitioner was, at the time of the commission of the crime, a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Dapitan City, Zamboanga del Norte, one of those public officers who, by express provision of Section 4 a.(1)(b) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Rep. Act No. 7975,
[5]
 is classified as SG 27.  Hence, the Sandiganbayan, not the RTC, has original jurisdiction over the case, regardless of his salary grade under Adm. Order No. 270.
On September 23, 1999, the respondent Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution denying the petitionerâs omnibus motion.  According to the court, the Information alleged that the petitioner has a salary grade of 27.  Furthermore, Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, which amended Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, provides that the petitioner, as a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Dapitan City, has a salary grade of 27.
[6]
On October 27, 1999, the petitioner filed a Supplemental Motion to his omnibus motion,
[7]
 citing Rep. Act No. 8294 and the ruling of this Court in 
Organo v. Sandiganbayan
,
[8]
 where it was declared that Rep. Act No. 8249, the latest amendment to the law creating the Sandiganbayan, â
collated the provisions on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan
,â and that â
the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan as a trial court was made to depend not on the penalty imposed by law on the crimes and offenses within its jurisdiction but on the rank and salary grade of accused government officials and employees
.â
In the meantime, the petitioner was conditionally arraigned on October 28, 1999 and entered a plea of not guilty.
[9]
On November 18, 1999, the petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Sandiganbayanâs September 23, 1999 Resolution.
[10]
 The motion was, however, denied by the Sandiganbayan in a Resolution promulgated on April 25, 2000.
[11]
Dissatisfied, the petitioner filed the instant petition for certiorari, contending as follows:
That Republic Act [No.] 8249 which took effect last 05 February 1997 made the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan as a trial court depend not only on the penalty imposed by law on the crimes and offenses within its jurisdiction but on the rank and salary grade of accused government officials and employees.
That the ruling of the Supreme Court in â
Lilia B. Organo versus The Sandiganbayan and the People of the Philippines,â G.R. No. 133535, 09 September 1999
, settles the matter on the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan as a trial court which is over public officials and employees with rank and salary grade 27 and above.
The petitioner contends that, at the time the offense charged was allegedly committed, he was already occupying the position of 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 Member I with SG 25.  Hence, under Section 4 of Rep. Act No. 8249, amending Rep. Act No. 7975, it is the RTC and not the Sandiganbayan that has jurisdiction over the offense lodged against him.  He asserts that under Adm. Order No. 270,
[12]
 Dapitan City is only a component city, and the members of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 are classified as 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 Members I with SG 25.  Thus, Section 4 a.(1)(b) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, and retained by Section 4 of Rep. Act No. 8249, does not apply to him.
On the other hand, the respondents, through the Office of the Special Prosecutor, contend that Section 4 a.(1)(b) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, expressly provides that the Sandiganbayan has original jurisdiction over violations of Rep. Act No. 3019, as amended, committed by the members of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
, without  qualification and regardless of salary grade.  They argue that when Congress approved Rep. Act No. 7975 and Rep. Act No. 8249, it was aware that not all the positions specifically mentioned in Section 4, subparagraph (1) were classified as SG 27, and yet were specifically included therein, 
viz
:
It is very clear from the aforecited provisions of law that the members of the 
sangguniang panlungsod
 are specifically included as among those falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
A reading of the aforesaid provisions, likewise, show that the qualification as to Salary Grade 27 and higher applies only to such officials of the executive branch other than the regional director and higher and those specifically enumerated.  To rule, otherwise, is to give a different interpretation to what the law clearly is.
Moreover, had there been an intention to make Salary Grade 27 and higher as the sole factor to determine the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan then the lawmakers could have simply stated that the officials of the executive branch, to fall within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, should have been occupying the positions with a Salary Grade of 27 and higher.  But the express wordings in both RA No. 7975 and RA No. 8249 specifically including the members of the 
sangguniang panlungsod
, among others, as those within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan only means that the said 
sangguniang
 members shall be within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the said court regardless of their Salary Grade.
In this connection too, it is well to state that the lawmakers are very well aware that not all the positions specifically mentioned as those within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan have a Salary Grade of 27 and higher.  Yet, the legislature has explicitly made the officials so enumerated in RA No. 7975 and RA No. 8249 as falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan because of the nature of these officialsâ functions and responsibilities as well as the power they can wield over their respective area of jurisdiction.
[13]
The threshold issue for the Courtâs resolution is whether the Sandiganbayan has original jurisdiction over the petitioner, a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Dapitan City, who was charged with violation of Section 3(e) of Rep. Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
The Court rules in the affirmative.
Rep. Act No. 7975, entitled âAn Act to Strengthen the Functional and Structural Organization of the Sandiganbayan, Amending for that Purpose Presidential Decree No. 1606,â took effect on May 16, 1995.  Section 2 thereof enumerates the cases falling within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  Subsequently, Rep. Act No. 7975 was amended by Rep. Act No. 8249, entitled âAn Act Further Defining the Jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, Amending for the Purpose Presidential Decree No. 1606, as Amended, Providing Funds Therefor, and for Other Purposes.â The amendatory law took effect on February 23, 1997 and Section 4 thereof enumerates the cases now falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
For purposes of determining which of the two laws, Rep. Act No. 7975 or Rep. Act No. 8249, applies in the present case, the reckoning period is the 
time of the commission of the offense
.
[14]
 Generally, the jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal case is to be determined by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action, not at the time of the commission of the crime.
[15]
 However, Rep. Act No. 7975, as well as Rep. Act No. 8249, constitutes an exception thereto as it expressly states that to determine the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan in cases involving violations of Rep. Act No. 3019, the reckoning period is the 
time of the commission of the offense
. This is plain from the last clause of the opening sentence of paragraph (a) of these two provisions which reads:
Sec. 4. Jurisdiction. The Sandiganbayan shall exercise [exclusive]
[16]
 original jurisdiction in all cases involving:
Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII, [Book II]
[17]
 of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the principal accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:
â¦
In this case, as gleaned from the Information filed in the Sandiganbayan, the crime charged was committed from the period of January 3, 1997 up to August 9, 1997.  The applicable law, therefore, is Rep. Act No. 7975.  Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975 expanded the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan as defined in Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, thus:
Sec. 4.  Jurisdiction. The Sandiganbayan shall exercise original jurisdiction in all cases involving:
[18]
Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code,
[19]
 where one or more of the principal accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:
Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as grade 27 and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (Republic Act No. 6758), 
specifically including
:
Provincial governors, vice-governors, members of the 
sangguniang panlalawigan
, and provincial treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other provincial department heads;
City mayors, vice-mayors, members of the 
sangguniang panlungsod
, city treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other city department heads
;
[20]
Officials of the diplomatic service occupying the position of consul and higher;
Philippine army and air force colonels, naval captains, and all officers of higher rank;
PNP chief superintendent and PNP officers of higher rank;
[21]
City and provincial prosecutors and their assistants, and officials and prosecutors in the Office of the Ombudsman and special prosecutor;
Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations;
Members of Congress and officials thereof classified as Grade â27â and up under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989;
Members of the judiciary without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution;
Chairmen and members of Constitutional Commissions, without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution; and
All other national and local officials classified as Grade â27â and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.
Other offenses or felonies committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection (a) of this section in relation to their office.
[22]
Civil and criminal cases filed pursuant to and in connection with Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A.
In cases where none of the principal accused are occupying positions corresponding to salary grade â27â or higher, as prescribed in the said Republic Act No. 6758, or PNP officers occupying the rank of superintendent or higher, or their equivalent, exclusive jurisdiction thereof shall be vested in the proper Regional Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, and Municipal Circuit Trial Court, as the case may be, pursuant to their respective jurisdiction as provided in 
Batas Pambansa Blg
. 129.
[23]
A plain reading of the above provision shows that, for purposes of determining the government officials that fall within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan in cases involving violations of Rep. Act No. 3019 and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code, Rep. Act No. 7975 has grouped them into five categories, to wit:
Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as grade 27 and higher. . .
Members of Congress and officials thereof classified as Grade â27â and up under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989;
Members of the judiciary without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution;
Chairmen and members of Constitutional Commissions, without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution; and
All other national and local officials classified as Grade â27â and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.
With respect to the first category, i.e., officials of the executive branch with SG 27 or higher, Rep. Act No. 7975 further 
specifically included
 the following officials as falling within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan:
Provincial governors, vice-governors, members of the 
sangguniang panlalawigan
, and provincial treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other provincial department heads;
City mayors, vice-mayors, members of the 
sangguniang panlungsod
, city treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other city department heads
;
Officials of the diplomatic service occupying the position of consul and higher;
Philippine army and air force colonels, naval captains, and all officers of higher rank;
PNP chief superintendent and PNP officers of higher rank;
City and provincial prosecutors and their assistants, and officials and prosecutors in the Office of the Ombudsman and special prosecutor;
Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations;
The specific inclusion of the foregoing officials constitutes an exception to the general qualification relating to officials of the executive branch as âoccupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as grade 27 and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.â  In other words, violation of Rep. Act No. 3019 committed by officials in the executive branch with SG 27 or higher, and the officials specifically enumerated in (a) to (g) of Section 4 a.(1) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, 
regardless of their salary grades
, likewise fall within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
Had it been the intention of Congress to confine the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan to violations of Rep. Act No. 3019 
only
 to officials in the executive branch with SG 27 or higher, then it could just have ended paragraph (1) of Section 4 a. of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, with the phrase âofficials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as grade 27 and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.â  Or the category in paragraph (5) of the same provision relating to â[a]ll other national and local officials classified as Grade â27â and up under the Compensation and Classification Act of 1989â would have sufficed. Instead, under paragraph (1) of Section 4 a. of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, Congress included specific officials, 
without any reference as to their salary grades
. Clearly, therefore, Congress intended these officials, regardless of their salary grades, to be specifically included within the Sandiganbayanâs original jurisdiction, for had it been otherwise, then there would have been no need for such enumeration.  It is axiomatic in legal hermeneutics that words in a statute should not be construed as surplusage if a reasonable construction which will give them some force and meaning is possible.
[24]
That the legislators intended to include certain public officials, regardless of their salary grades, within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan is apparent from the legislative history of both Rep. Acts Nos. 7975 and 8249.  In his sponsorship speech of Senate Bill No. 1353, which was substantially adopted by both Houses of Congress and became Rep. Act No. 7975, Senator Raul S. Roco, then Chairman of the Committee on Justice and Human Rights, explained:
Senate Bill No. 1353 modifies the present jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan such that only those occupying high positions in the government and the military fall under the jurisdiction of the court.
As proposed by the Committee, the Sandiganbayan shall exercise original jurisdiction over cases assigned to it only in instances where one or more of the principal accused are officials occupying the positions of regional director and higher or are otherwise classified as Grade 27 and higher by the Compensation and Classification Act of 1989, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity at the time of the commission of the offense.  The jurisdiction, therefore, refers to a certain grade upwards, which shall remain with the Sandiganbayan.
The President of the Philippines and other impeachable officers such as the justices of the Supreme Court and constitutional commissions are not subject to the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan during their incumbency.
The bill provides for an extensive listing of 
other public officers
 who will be subject to the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan
.  It includes, among others, Members of Congress, judges and justices of all courts.
[25]
More instructive is the sponsorship speech, again, of Senator Roco, of Senate Bill No. 844, which was substantially adopted by both Houses of Congress and became Rep. Act No. 8249.  Senator Roco explained the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan in Rep. Act No. 7975, thus:
SPONSORSHIP OF SENATOR ROCO
â¦
By way of sponsorship, Mr. President â we will issue the full sponsorship speech to the members because it is fairly technical â may we say the following things:
To speed up trial in the Sandiganbayan, Republic Act No. 7975 was enacted for that Court to concentrate on the âlarger fishâ and leave the âsmall fryâ to the lower courts.  This law became effective on May 6, 1995 and it provided a two-pronged solution to the clogging of the dockets of that court, to wit:
It divested the Sandiganbayan of jurisdiction over public officials whose salary grades were at Grade â26â or lower, devolving thereby these cases to the lower courts, and retaining the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan only over public officials whose salary grades were at Grade â27â or higher 
and over other specific public officials holding important positions in government regardless of salary grade
;
[26]
Evidently, the officials enumerated in (a) to (g) Section 4 a.(1) of P.D. No. 1606, amended Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, were specifically included within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan because the lawmakers considered them âbig fishâ and their positions important, regardless of their salary grades.
This conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that some of the officials enumerated in (a) to (g) are not classified as SG 27 or higher under the Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades issued by the Department of Budget and Management in 1989, then in effect at the time that Rep. Act No. 7975 was approved.  For example:

Noticeably, the vice mayors, members of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 and prosecutors, 
without any distinction or qualification
, were specifically included in Rep. Act No. 7975 as falling within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  Moreover, the consuls, city department heads, provincial department heads and members of the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
, 
albeit classified as having salary grades 26 or lower
, were also specifically included within the Sandiganbayanâs original jurisdiction.  As correctly posited by the respondents, Congress is presumed to have been aware of, and had taken into account, these officialsâ respective salary grades when it deliberated upon the amendments to the Sandiganbayan jurisdiction. Nonetheless, Congress passed into law Rep. Act No. 7975, specifically including them within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  By doing so, it obviously intended cases mentioned in Section 4 a. of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975, when committed by the officials enumerated in (1) (a) to (g) thereof, regardless of their salary grades, to be tried by the Sandiganbayan.
Indeed, it is a basic precept in statutory construction that the intent of the legislature is the controlling factor in the interpretation of a statute.
[37]
 From the congressional records and the text of Rep. Acts No. 7975 and 8294, the legislature undoubtedly intended the officials enumerated in (a) to (g) of Section 4 a.(1) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by the aforesaid subsequent laws, to be included within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
Following this disquisition, the paragraph of Section 4 which provides that if the accused is occupying a position lower than SG 27, the proper trial court has jurisdiction,
[38]
 can only be properly interpreted as applying to those cases where the principal accused is occupying a position lower than SG 27 
and
 not among those specifically included in the enumeration in Section 4 a. (1)(a) to (g).  Stated otherwise, except for those officials specifically included in Section 4 a. (1) (a) to (g), 
regardless of their salary grades
, over whom the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction, all other public officials below SG 27 shall be under the jurisdiction of the proper trial courts âwhere none of the principal accused are occupying positions corresponding to SG 27 or higher.â  By this construction, the entire Section 4 is given effect.  The cardinal rule, after all, in statutory construction is that the particular words, clauses and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole.
[39]
 And courts should adopt a construction that will give effect to every part of a statute, if at all possible. 
Ut magis valeat quam pereat
 or that construction is to be sought which gives effect to the whole of the statute â its every word.
[40]
In this case, there is no dispute that the petitioner is a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Dapitan City and he is charged with violation of Section 3 (e) of Rep. Act No. 3019.  Members of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 are specifically included as among those within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan in Section 4 a.(1) (b) of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 7975,
[41]
 or even Section 4 of Rep. Act No. 8249
[42]
 for that matter.  The Sandiganbayan, therefore, has original jurisdiction over the petitionerâs case docketed as Criminal Case No. 25116.
IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING
, the petition is DISMISSED.  The Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated September 23, 1999 and April 25, 2000 are AFFIRMED.  No costs.
