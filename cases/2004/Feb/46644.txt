The Facts
Version of the Prosecution
In its Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecutionâs version of the facts in the following manner:
â
Regina G. Acu[Ã±]a
 was a jobless 22-year old married woman residing in Payatas, Quezon City.  On January 23, 2001, between three oâclock and four oâclock in the afternoon, she was walking down Manggahan St. in Fairview, Quezon City, looking for a job.  As she went along, appellant Arevalo, a stranger, approached and asked her what her problem was.  She replied that she was looking for a job.  Appellant Arevalo told Regina that he could get her a job as saleslady.  Regina said that if the place of work was far, she was not interested.  Appellant Arevalo told her not to worry, as the workplace was not far, and that nothing wrong would happen to her.  Regina did not believe him.
âWhile they were talking, a car stopped in front of them.  Suddenly, appellant Arevalo placed a white handkerchief on Reginaâs face and boarded her on the vehicle.  Regina could not remember what happened next.  She could not even recall whether she slept or lost consciousness.  All she knew was that when she woke up, she was already lying on a bed inside a room.  It was nighttime.
âIn the room, Regina saw appellant Arevalo and a fat lady whom he identified as Rose, his â
atsay
â or helper.  Regina later learned that Roseâs real name was Ruth Acosta.  Ruth looked like she was in a state of shock, or, â
tulala
â.
âAppellant Arevalo left momentarily.  When he came back, he forcibly took off Reginaâs clothes.  Regina asked him what he was doing, and he replied that what he would do would only take a while.  Appellant Arevalo then undressed himself.  When Regina saw this, she pleaded with him to take pity on her and to release her, as her husband may have been worrying for her already.  Appellant Arevalo repeated that it would not take long.  Regina shouted for help. But nobody heard her, as appellant Arevalo had closed the door and windows.  While she was shouting, appellant Arevalo raised her feet and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina.
âAs Regina lay on the bed, she kept on shouting and resisting appellant Arevaloâs sexual assault.  At one point, she was able to free herself from him and run.  But he caught up with her, grabbed her hair, banged her head against the wall and threw her back to the bed, where he continued to ravish her.  Rose, or Ruth Acosta, was looking on helplessly, crying while Regina was being violated.
âFrom that night onward until February 14, 2001, Regina would be wearing nothing almost all the time, for she would be ravished for what seemed like âalmost every day and every hour.â
âOn January 24, 2001, an unidentified man raped Regina in the same room.  Before raping her[,] however, the man paid appellant Arevalo a sum of money.  Regina could not see the manâs face, as appellant Arevalo had blindfolded her.  But she heard the man tell appellant Arevalo, â
Pare, itong bayad
.â
âThe unidentified man made Regina take different sexual positions even as she resisted.  At one time, he inserted his penis into her anus; at another, he inserted his finger and later, his penis, into her vagina. Thereafter, appellant Arevalo made her eat the manâs penis. Regina struggled hard to free herself from the manâs clutches, but she was no match for him.
âWhen the man had left, appellant Arevalo took off Reginaâs blindfold.  Regina saw him counting the money the man had paid him.  Thereafter, appellant Arevalo ravished Regina himself.  When he was finished, appellant Arevalo again sold Regina to another unidentified man, who proceeded to have sex with her.  By this time, Regina was no longer shouting for help because no one could hear or help her anyway.
âOn January 25, 2001, appellant Arevalo again blindfolded Regina and let other men ravish her for a fee while he stood guard outside the door of his house.  The first man who had sex with Regina inserted his penis into her vagina while he was on top of her, covering her mouth with his hand because she was noisy.  Regina kept shouting for help, but nobody heard her.  So she just cried and cried and threw punches at the man, but he would not stop ravishing her.  To keep her from resisting, the man pointed a knife at her neck and threatened to kill her.  When the man was through, another man followed.  By then, Regina was no longer putting up any resistance because she was âafraid and at the same time, already very weak.â  Around six (6) men raped her in succession that day, but she could only recognize appellant Arevalo among them.
âOn January 26, 2001, appellant Arevalo forced the two (2) women to take drugs.  Appellant Arevalo made Regina sniff the smoke of a powdered substance or â
tawas
â wrapped in a foil.  When she refused, he threatened to slash her neck.  He also made the girls take tablets which Regina later discovered to be birth control pills.
âThereafter, appellant Arevalo inserted his penis into Reginaâs vagina.  While he was raping her, he ran the point of his knife up and down her body, from her breasts to her vagina.  Regina was very afraid.
âAfter appellant Arevalo had reached a climax, he blindfolded Ruth and made her have sex with many other men.
âOn January 27, 2001, appellant Arevalo ravished Regina again in a similar manner as the previous days.  By then, Regina was very weak.
âOn many occasions during her first five (5) days in captivity, and even thereafter, Regina tried to escape, but appellant Arevalo would always catch up with her and hurt her.  He would tie up her hands and hang her while having sex with her.  Whenever he left the house, he would lock it from the outside to prevent Regina and Ruth from leaving.  Although appellant Arevalo would buy the girls food, Regina oftentimes refused to eat, because she knew that the food was bought with the money appellant Arevalo earned from peddling their bodies.
âOn January 28, 2001, appellant Arevalo brought Regina to another place.  She did not know where the place was because she was dizzy with the drugs he had made her use.
âOn January 29, 2001, appellant Arevalo drugged Regina again.  Thereafter, he had sexual intercourse with her.  Regina begged him to let her go home because her husband was waiting for her, but her plea fell on deaf ears.  Many other men ravished Regina that day.
âOn January 30, 2001, appellant Arevalo forced Regina to make a choice between marijuana and â
tawas
.â  When Regina refused to choose, he threatened to slash her throat.  Afraid, Regina finally chose â
tawas.
â  Appellant Arevalo told her to take it so that she would not feel the pain in her vagina, which was already bleeding.  Thereafter, appellant Arevalo raped her.
âOn January 31, 2001, appellant Arevalo had forcible sexual intercourse with Regina again.  Thereafter, not content with putting his fingers into her private part, appellant Arevalo inserted a lighted cigarette inside.  Although Regina was taking the drug appellant Arevalo forced her to use, she still felt the pain in her vagina caused by the hot cigarette.
âOn February 1, 2001, after forcibly copulating with Regina yet another time, appellant Arevalo sold her again to other men.
âOn the night of February 2, 2001, appellant Arevalo again moved Regina to another place which she could not remember, because she was dizzy then.  Although there were other passengers on the public utility jeepney that they took on the way to the place, Regina could not ask for help, as appellant Arevalo was poking a knife at her back inside her t-shirt the whole time and had earlier warned her that he would kill her if she shouted.  They arrived at a concrete house which had a vulcanizing shop at the ground floor.  When they were inside the building, appellant Arevalo blindfolded Regina and hanged her by the hands.  Regina heard womenâs voices, but she was not sure whether they were real or came from the television set in the room.  That night, Regina was again raped by unidentified persons.  Appellant Arevalo and Regina left the place at half past midnight.
âFrom February 3 up to February 5, 2001, appellant Arevalo continued to subject [her] to his bestial designs.  Each time, he succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina and in consummating the intercourse.  Regina no longer put up any resistance because her body had been rendered very weak from her days of endless ravishment.
âOn February 6, 2001, Regina fell ill with fever, and Ruth took care of her.  Reginaâs illness did not stop appellant Arevalo from molesting her that day.  Before she was raped, Regina begged appellant Arevalo to allow her to call her parents and even offered him any sum of money as he desired, but he slapped her, saying that he needed her body and not her money.  He also told Ruth to slap her, and so Ruth slapped her.
âOn February 7, 2001, Regina could only beg appellant Arevalo to take pity on her.  She was chilling and she tried to push him away, to no avail, for once again, appellant Arevalo successfully penetrated her private organ.
âOn February 8, 2001, Regina discovered that she had a venereal disease, or â
tulo.
â But this did not spare her from appellant Arevaloâs carnal greed.  She stopped resisting him, for her body had long been worn down by ceaseless abuse.
âReginaâs ordeal continued from February 9 up to February 14, 2001.  Every single day, appellant Arevalo would ravish her without letup.
âOn February 14, 2001, appellant Organista, a friend and neighbor of appellant Arevalo, also had a taste of Reginaâs flesh.  After appellant Arevalo stripped her naked, appellant Organista made his move.  Regina pushed him away as he approached her, but appellant Arevalo teased him, saying, â
kaya mo yan pre.
â  Appellant Organista proceeded to insert his penis into Reginaâs vagina while she lay down on the floor, with appellant Arevalo looking on.  After appellant Organista was finished, appellant Arevalo took over in ravishing Regina and succeeded in penetrating her as well.
â
Ruth F. Acosta
, a native of Bukidnon, left her family for Manila when she was about eighteen (18) years old.  Her highest educational attainment was the third grade of primary school.  Unable to find any relatives in Manila, she ended up loitering and sleeping on the streets of Luneta.
âOn January 23, 2001, about a year she had left the province, Ruth Acosta met appellant Oliver Arevalo at the Luneta park.  It was around six oâclock in the evening.  Appellant Arevalo told Ruth that he could help her find a job and invited her to go with him.  Ruth went with appellant Arevalo and they boarded a jeepney.  They arrived at (what turned out to be) appellant Arevaloâs house in Pembo, Makati, a few hours later.
âUpon entering the house, appellant Arevalo pushed Ruth Acosta to the bed and stripped off her clothes.  Thereafter, appellant Arevalo removed his own clothes and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina.  Ruth could not recall what happened immediately thereafter, except that she felt pain in her private part.  She was also bleeding badly, for she had just lost her virginity to her assailant.
âThat same evening, after she was ravished by appellant Arevalo, Ruth was raped by appellant Arevaloâs friend and neighbor, herein appellant Organista, in the same room.
âThe following day, January 24, 2001, appellant Arevalo raped Ruth Acosta again.  He took off his clothes, undressed Ruth, and inserted his penis into her vagina, causing her to feel pain.  While she was being raped, Ruth attempted to resist appellant Arevalo by âpulling backwards her two hands with clenched fistsâ, but her resistance was futile.
âOn January 25, 2001, appellant Arevalo forcibly had sexual intercourse with Ruth again on his bed.  He inserted his organ into her private part, and once more, she felt pain.  Many other men raped Ruth in the same room that night after paying a fee to appellant Arevalo, but she could not identify said men because she was blindfolded by him.  She recognized appellant Organista, though, as one of those who raped her while she was blindfolded because she was able to hold his beard while he was ravishing her and she was already familiar with his face.
âOn January 26, 2001, appellants Organista and Arevalo took turns in raping Ruth.  Appellant Organista removed Ruthâs clothes, after which, appellant Arevalo had forcible sexual intercourse with her.  Try as she might to resist the two (2) men, she was easily overpowered by them.  After appellant Arevalo was through with Ruth, he left the room.  Appellant Organista then proceeded to defile her, inserting his penis into her vagina.  As a result of her ravishment by the two (2) men, Ruth experienced pain whenever she urinated.
âThe next day, January 27, 2001, appellant Arevalo blindfolded Ruth.  Thereafter, she was raped successively by several unidentified men.
âOn January 28, 2001, appellants Arevalo and Organista forced Ruth to take drugs.  Next, appellant Arevalo blindfolded Ruth.  Thereafter, several unidentified men raped Ruth, one after the other, in appellant Arevaloâs room.  Before sexually abusing her, each of these men paid a fee to appellant Arevalo.  Ruth knew this, because she would hear the men say to him, â
Pare bayad
â or â
Pare ito na ang pambayad.
â
âOn January 29, 2001, appellant Arevalo vented his carnal desire on Ruth again.  After undressing Ruth, he had forcible sexual intercourse with her on his bed.
âOn January 30, 2001, appellant Arevalo forced himself upon Ruth once more.  While appellant Arevalo was raping her, appellant Organista, who was visiting, merely looked on and did nothing to stop his friend and neighbor. After appellant Arevalo had ejaculated, appellant Organista took over, ravishing Ruth until he, too, succeeded in discharging his semen on her.  While this was going on, appellant Arevalo merely stood by, laughing.
âOn January 31, 2001, appellant Arevalo sexually abused Ruth yet another time, piercing her womanhood and bringing himself to a climax.  Other men followed in raping her that night in appellant Arevaloâs room, but she could not see them because appellant Arevalo had covered her eyes.
âThe following day, February 1, 2001, five (5) men raped Ruth in succession in the same room after paying a sum to appellant Arevalo.  Once again, she could not see their faces because appellant Arevalo had blindfolded her.
âOn February 2, 2001, appellants Arevalo and Organista took turns in raping Ruth in appellant Arevaloâs room.  Ruth knew that both men had reached a climax after forcibly copulating with her, for her vagina was very wet with their semen.
âOn February 3, 2001, appellant Arevalo slapped Ruth, pulled her hair, inserted his penis into her vagina and ravished her until he ejaculated.  Appellant Organista followed, similarly unleashing his seminal fluid on the hapless woman upon reaching a climax, while appellant Arevalo looked on and held her down.  Ruthâs ordeal did not end at this point, for she was subsequently raped by several other men after paying appellant Arevalo one hundred pesos (P100.00) each.
âOn February 4, 2001, appellants Arevalo and Organista again raped Ruth in the same room.  Appellant Organista had forcible sexual intercourse with Ruth until he ejaculated; he also forced her to eat his penis.  Appellant Arevalo followed, inserting his penis into her private part, causing it to hurt.  He also ejaculated his semen on her.
âIn addition, appellant Arevalo, as with previous dates, sold Ruth to many other men that day.  All of them sexually abused her after each paying appellant Arevalo one hundred pesos (P100.00).
âOn February 5, 2001, appellant Arevalo once more peddled Ruth and Regina to unidentified persons who each paid him one hundred pesos (P100.00).  Appellant Arevalo also forcibly copulated with the two (2) women that day.  Additionally, appellant Organista ravished Ruth to the point of ejaculation while appellant Arevalo watched.  Ruth could only lie helpless while she was being raped by appellants, as they were too strong for her.
âOn February 6, 2001, appellants Arevalo and Organista raped Ruth again.  Appellant Organista ravished Ruth first, undressing her, inserting his manhood into her as she lay on appellant Arevaloâs bed, and helping himself to an orgasm while leaving Ruth in pain.  Appellant Arevalo then took over, defiling her as well.  Thereafter, he blindfolded her and sold her for sex to other unidentified men.
âOn February 7 and 8, 2001, appellant Arevalo repeated his ravishment of the helpless woman until he ejaculated on her.
âThereafter, appellant Arevalo blindfolded Ruth and sold her flesh to many other men.  Again, Ruth knew this, for she heard them say to him, âPare bayadâ and she also heard him talking to them.
âOn February 9, 2001, appellant Arevalo blindfolded the two (2) women and sold their sexual services to several men.  Appellant Arevalo warned Ruth that he had already killed a man before, and she believed him; hence, she did not dare remove her blindfold because she was afraid of him.
âOn February 10, 2001, appellant Arevalo forcibly consummated his lust on Ruth once more.  He also let other men ravish her for a fee.
âOn February 11, 2001, several men paid appellant Arevalo to have sex with the two (2) women.  Appellant Arevalo himself did not spare Ruth, penetrating her maidenhood yet another time until he was satisfied.
âOn February 12, 13, and 14, 2001, appellant Arevalo again peddled the women to other men for sex.  Appellants Arevalo and Organista were not to be outdone, for they, too, ravished Ruth on February 12 and 13, 2001.
â
On the night of February 14, 2001
, after they had fulfilled their lustful designs on the two (2) women and prostituted them to other men, appellants Arevalo and Organista had a drinking spree in the formerâs room.  Thereafter, they fell asleep.  Regina Acu[Ã±]a got the key to the door from appellant Arevaloâs pocket, dragged Ruth Acosta with her, and together they escaped.  Regina and Ruth then reported their horrifying ordeal to the Makati police.  It was around 9:30 in the evening.
âThat same evening, a team of Makati policemen and 
barangay tanods
 went to appellant Arevaloâs house accompanied by the Regina and Ruth.  They knocked on the door.  When appellant Arevalo opened the door, he was immediately identified by the women as their ravisher.  Appellant Arevalo tried to escape, but he was quickly arrested by the police.  Thereafter, the police and the two (2) women proceeded to appellant Organistaâs residence which appellant Arevalo had readily pinpointed to them.  The police knocked on the door and appellant Organista opened it.  Again, the two (2) women quickly identified him as their other rapist.  The moment he saw the policemen and the women, appellant Organista also tried to escape, but the police immediately apprehended him.
âThe following day, the private complainants were physically examined by Dr. Miriam S. Guialani, the deputy chief of the Womenâs Crisis and Child Protection Center of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Camp Crame, Quezon City.
âDr. Guialani found infected erosions or abrasions at the 8 and 9 oâclock positions in the labial fold of Reginaâs external genitalia, most likely caused by constant friction.  She also noted hematoma, infection and fresh lacerations in the hymen at the 2 and 4 oâclock positions.  In addition, the hymen was very very red and swollen, indicating that it had been subjected to force and violence.  There was also a foul-smelling yellowish vaginal discharge strongly indicative of a sexually transmitted disease.  On the whole, Dr. Guialani noted that the âgenital findings show clear evidence of previous penetrating trauma.â
âOn the other hand, Dr. Guialani found healed lacerations at the 4, 7 and 8 oâclock positions in Ruthâs hymen.  She also noted edema and swelling at the hymenal rim and its mucosal tissues.  Dr. Guialani similarly reported that Ruthâs âgenital findings show clear evidence of previous trauma.ââ

Version of the Defense
On the other hand, the defense presented the following version of the facts:
â
OLIVER AREVALO
 testified that since December 27, 2000, he was in Ormoc, Leyte with his wife and two (2) children.  On February 10, 2001, he went back to Manila to borrow money from his brother Tony to put up a sari-sari store but he was asked by his brotherâs secretary to come back on February 13, 2001 so he went back to his brotherâs house but his brother referred him to their elder brother at Project 6, Quezon City.  He was only given P500.00.  At around 4:00 oâclock p.m., he proceeded to Luneta where policemen were arresting vagrants at that time.  The two (2) women, Ruth and Apple, referring to complainants Acosta and Acu[Ã±]a, were arrested.  He helped them by giving them food and clothing.  They went with him to Makati and arrived at their house at around 11:30 p.m.  The next day, February 12, 2001, the two (2) women were hungry again and Acosta was asking for transportation fare.  He brought them to Organistaâs house and the latter gave P10.00 to Acosta.  The two (2) women left at around 1:30 in the afternoon.  He had a drinking spree with Organista at his house.  At around 1:00 in the morning, he saw policemen together with the two (2) women and one of the policemen boxed him, so he pointed Organistaâs house to them.
â
HERMINIGILDO ORGANISTA
 could not remember where he was from January 23, to 26, 2001 because he was treated with ECI for about five (5) times at the National Mental Health Hospital since 1983.  He claimed that said treatment has the tendency of weakening or affecting oneâs memory.  He corroborated the testimony of accused Arevalo that he only gave P10.00 for the food of Acosta.
â
AVELINA ORGANISTA
 testified that her son was treated at the National Mental Health in 1983.  His last examination was in 1997.  After said examination, her son could no longer work because they have to bind him because he was uncontrollable.  He even threatened her that he would kill her when she opposed what he was doing.  On the dates of the alleged rapes, her son was at home with her.
â
DR. PIA ALMA DE JESUS
 of the National Center for Mental Health testified that she first saw accused Organista for treatment on April 11, 2001.  She learned from the hospital records that said accused had been mentally ill since 1982 or 1983 and had 23 admissions at the mental hospital.  During his last admission, he was given oral medication to control his psychotic symptoms like illusions and hallucination.  Failure to regularly take said medication could cause a relapse that would render him [unfit] for trial.
â
JESUS OCAMPO
, driver and all around helper of accused Arevaloâs brother, Tony, testified that he usually see Arevalo on Tuesdays as the latter used to ask money from Tony.â

Ruling of the Trial Court
The RTC found Arevalo and Organista guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 42 and 32 counts of rape, respectively â committed from January 23, 2001 to February 14, 2001.
The positive and straightforward testimonies of the victims, corroborated by medical reports, sufficiently proved the guilt of appellants.  Having closely observed the demeanor of the victims during trial, the lower court found them credible.  It found evidence that they had suffered extreme trauma, pain, humiliation and distress.  It held that there was no ill motivation on their part to impute such serious offenses to appellants.
The RTC found many inconsistencies in the defenses of denial and alibi resorted to by Arevalo.  
First
, he could not state with certainty whether he and his family had left for Ormoc City or for Valencia, Leyte, when the rapes were committed.  He failed to present bus tickets to support his claim, notwithstanding his manifestation during the trial that he would present them before the court.  
Second
, the trial court was puzzled by his testimony that, because his brother came home early from work on Tuesdays, on those days he had to go to the latterâs house, which served as both office and residence.  
Third
, on cross-examination, the brotherâs helper contradicted Arevalo by testifying that the former had not seen the latter in the house on February 10, 2001, the date on which one of the rapes had supposedly taken place.  
Fourth
, the residence of the brother of Arevalo turned out to be located in Project 2, Quezon City, not in Project 3 as the latter repeatedly testified to.
The defense of insanity proffered by Organista likewise failed to convince the trial court.  He presented his mother who testified that he was not of sound mind, and that he had never left her side ever since he was a young boy.  He contradicted her, however, when he declared on the stand that he was an electrician and a mason by vocation.  According to him, during the period 1999 to March 2001 when he engaged in his vocation, he never received any complaints on his behavior from the people he constantly worked or associated with.
Although Organista was indeed confined at the National Center for Mental Health, the period of his confinement did not include the period of the commission of the rapes, as he was last discharged from the Center in 1997.  Moreover, he failed to prove his claimed insanity during or near the time of the commission thereof.
On the contrary, when the arresting policemen, together with the victims, proceeded to his house, Organista tried to escape.  His reaction was indicative of guilt and awareness of the wrong he had inflicted on the victims.
Hence, this automatic review before us.

The Issues
Appellants raise the following errors for our consideration:
I
âThe lower court erred in not appreciating the exempting circumstance of insanity interposed by Accused-appellant Herminigildo Organista despite strong and convincing evidence presented to prove the same.
II
âThe lower court erred in finding that conspiracy existed between the Accused-appellants.
III
âThe lower court erred in imposing upon x x x Accused-appellant Herminigildo Organista the supreme penalty of death notwithstanding the presence of a mitigating circumstance.
IV
âThe lower court erred in imposing the supreme penalty of death upon Accused-appellants on the assumption that they are guilty of the crime charged.â
[13]
Simply put, appellantsâ arguments hinge on the following: (1) the trial court failed to appreciate Organistaâs defense of insanity; (2) no conspiracy existed between appellants; and (3) they should have been found guilty of simple, not qualified, rape.
For clarity, we shall discuss in reverse order the issues raised by appellants.
The Courtâs Ruling
Appellants are guilty of simple, not qualified, rape; hence, the penalty for each count should be reduced from death to 
reclusion perpetua.
First Issue:
Proper Crime and Penalty
Appellants maintain that the evidence of the prosecution is weak, and that their defense of alibi and denial should have entitled them to an acquittal.  Organista adds that, assuming they were guilty, he should have been entitled to the mitigating circumstance of illness that diminishes an offenderâs exercise of will power, pursuant to Article 13(9)
[14]
 of the Revised Penal Code.
In addition, appellants contend that the Informations did not allege with specificity that two persons had raped the victims.  Therefore, they argue, the rapes should not have been qualified and they should not have been sentenced to death, which is the higher penalty provided under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.  Accordingly, the penalty for each conviction of rape should have been 
reclusion perpetua
.
The contentions of appellants are partly meritorious.  While their respective defenses of denial, alibi and insanity must fail, we find them guilty only of simple, not qualified, rape.
Alibi and Denial
The positive, consistent and straightforward testimonies of the victims sufficiently established appellantsâ culpability.  Well-settled is the rule that denial and alibi, being weak defenses, cannot overcome the positive testimonies of the offended parties.
[15]
In order to merit credibility, denial must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability,
[16]
 which herein appellants failed to show.  And in order for alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that they were at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it was physically impossible for them to be at the 
locus delicti
 or its immediate vicinity.
[17]
In the present case, appellants failed to demonstrate this fact.  Without presenting any evidence to support his bare assertion,
[18]
 Arevalo merely testified that he was in Ormoc, Leyte, from December 27, 2000, to February 10, 2001.  He said that the bus ticket evidencing his trip to Leyte on December 27, 2000, was with his wife, while the return ticket to Manila on February 10, 2001, was with his brother.  To corroborate his testimony, he manifested that he would present the tickets in court after retrieving them,
[19]
 but he failed to do so.
On the other hand, the mother of Organista averred that her son had stayed with her during the entire period of the commission of the rapes.  But since their house was near Arevaloâs, or the place where the rapes were committed, then it would not have been unlikely for him to be in the vicinity at the time of the rapes.
The victimsâ testimonies, corroborated by the results of the medical examination, convincingly proved that appellants were the perpetrators.  It is a time-tested rule that the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is best undertaken by the trial court, because it had the opportunity to observe them firsthand and to note their demeanor and conduct on the witness stand.
[20]
 For this reason, its findings on such matters, absent any arbitrariness or oversight of facts or circumstances of weight and substance, are final and conclusive upon this Court.
[21]
 It is likewise well-settled that when a woman declares that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed; and when her testimony passes the test of credibility, the accused can be convicted on the basis thereof.
[22]
On the rapes committed against her on January 23 and 24, 2001, AcuÃ±a testified as follows:
 
âQ:

[26]
After a painstaking review of the records of the case, we find no cogent reason to disturb the trial courtâs findings on the credibility of the witnesses.  When in open court they positively identified appellants as their rapists, the trial court rightly declared:
âThe Court has closely observed the demeanor of the two complainants and did not find any ill-motive on their part to impute a serious offense against the two accused.  Clearly evident were the trauma, pain, humiliation and distress on the part of Acu[Ã±]a and the state of daze or shock Acosta was in. x x x.â
[27]
Nevertheless, though appellants are guilty of raping the victims, modifications have to be made regarding the counts of rape for which each of them should be held liable.
From January 23 to 26, 2001,
[28]
 only Arevalo, not Organista, should be held liable for the rapes of AcuÃ±a.  A careful review of the records
[29]
 shows that she identified only Arevalo as her rapist on those dates.
For the rapes committed against Acosta on January 23, 25 and 26, 2001,
[30]
 her testimony confirmed that both appellants had raped her separately.
[31]
 It was not established, however, that Organista had raped her on January 24, 2001;
[32]
 therefore, only Arevalo should have been convicted for the rape on that date.
AcuÃ±a, on the other hand, clearly testified
[33]
 that Organista had raped her only on February 14, 2001.
[34]
 She further testified that after raping her, Organista had subsequently raped Acosta.
[35]
 But Acosta was silent on whether she was raped by Organista on that date.
[36]
 Because she was the best person to say whether he had raped her on that date, and she was silent on the matter, we resolve the doubt in his favor and acquit him of the offense that he allegedly committed on that date.
Regarding the other counts of rape, we find no reason to disturb the trial courtâs findings.  For the rape of AcuÃ±a, Arevalo is found guilty of simple rape under Criminal Case Nos. 01-419 to 423, 01-425 to 01-428 and 01-430 to 01-441.  He is likewise found guilty of the rape of Acosta in Criminal Case Nos. 01-442 to 01-446, 01-448 to 01-451 and 01-0453 to 01-464.
On the other hand, for the rape of AcuÃ±a, Organista is found guilty of simple rape under Criminal Case Nos. 01-441.  He is also found guilty of the rape of Acosta in Criminal Case Nos. 01-442, 01-444 to 01-445 and 01-464.
Criminal Liability
The trial court erred, however, in imposing the penalty of death upon appellants when it appreciated the circumstance of rape by two or more persons 
twice
 â once as a qualifying, then as an aggravating, circumstance.
Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides:
âART. 266-B.  
Penalties.
 â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
âWhenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
x x x                                         x x x                                  x x x.â
From the above, whenever the crime committed is simple rape, the penalty to be imposed is the single penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.  On the other hand, whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
We must note, however, that the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which took effect on December 1, 2000, requires that the complaint or information should state the qualifying and the aggravating circumstances with specificity.
[37]
  In the present case, no aggravating circumstance was alleged in the Informations.  Hence, the lesser penalty should be applied, as the Court held in 
People v. Sabredo
:
[38]
âThe imposable penalty for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, is 
reclusion perpetua
.  But where the rape is committed with the use of deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the imposable penalty ranges from reclusion perpetua to death. The use of the bladed weapon already qualified the rape.  Under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, the crucial factor in determining whether appellant should be meted the death penalty is the presence of an aggravating circumstance which attended the commission of the crime.  A perusal of the records shows that none of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code was alleged and proven by the prosecution.  Where there is no aggravating circumstance proved in the commission of the offense, the lesser penalty shall be applied.â
[39]
Second Issue:
Conspiracy
Appellants contend that conspiracy did not attend the rapes committed from January 23 to 26 and on February 14, 2001.
This contention is partly meritorious.
Without specifying whether it was referring to AcuÃ±a or Acosta, the trial court declared that appellants were in conspiracy in the rapes committed from January 23 to 26 and on February 14, 2001.  From the records, however, it seems that no such conspiracy took place when appellants separately raped Acosta on those dates.  To be appreciated, conspiracy must be shown to have been committed as clearly and convincingly as the offense itself.
[40]
The Rape of Regina AcuÃ±a
As regards AcuÃ±a, there was conspiracy only during the rape that occurred on February 14, 2001.  We reiterate that, from the records,
[41]
 her account of the rapes that happened from January 23 to 26, 2001 shows that only Arevalo, not Organista, raped her.  Furthermore, no conspiracy attended the rapes on those dates.
On February 14, 2001, both appellants raped her.
[42]
 It was Arevalo who removed her clothes before Organista raped her.
[43]
 Moreover, when the latter advanced towards her and she pushed him away, Arevalo â who was standing inside the same room all the while â kept egging him on by saying, â
Kaya mo yan pre.
â  The latter continued until he consummated his bestial attack upon the victim.
We have held that an overt act in furtherance of conspiracy may consist of lending moral assistance to the co-conspirators even through oneâs mere presence at the scene of the crime.
[44]
 In the present case (Criminal Case No. 01-441), Arevaloâs presence and words encouraged Organista to pursue his savage designs.
The Rape of Ruth Acosta
The records of the rape of Acosta from January 23 to 26 and on February 14, 2001, do not support the finding of conspiracy.
On January 23, 2001,
[45]
 appellants separately raped her one after the other, but only Arevalo raped her on January 24, 2001.
[46]
 On January 25
[47]
 and 26,
[48]
 appellants again separately raped her one after the other, but it was only Arevalo who raped her on February 14, 2001.
[49]
Third Issue:
Insanity
Organista argues that the trial court erred in not exempting him from criminal liability, even though he was insane or completely deprived of intelligence during the commission of the rapes.  He avers that his insanity may be deduced from the following:
First
, he cannot remember the events that transpired from January 23 to February 14, 2001, because the treatments he has been undergoing at the National Center for Mental Health since 1983 have weakened his memory.
Second
, Dr. Pia Alma de Jesus of the National Center for Mental Health testified that he had displayed psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions.  She opined that his failure to take his medications regularly could have caused his relapse.
Third
, the behavior and actuations he exhibited before and after the rapes were manifestations of mental instability.  As testified to by his mother, he was violent and destructive to the extent of habitually setting their home furniture on fire.  He even threatened to kill her when she confronted him on his behavior.
Fourth
, the New Bilibid Prison, where he is presently locked up, certified that he still suffers from chronic schizophrenia.
We are not persuaded.
The law presumes everyone to be sane.
[50]
 The accused who pleads the exempting circumstance of insanity incurs the burden of proving it.
[51]
 To be adjudged insane under Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code, he or she must have been completely deprived of reason or discernment and freedom of the will at the time the crime was committed.
[52]
 For such deprivation to be ascertained, it is but proper to receive evidence during a reasonable period before or after the commission of the crime, for the mind â its thoughts, motives and emotions â may be fathomed only by examining whether the external acts conform with those of people of sound minds.
[53]
In the present case, while Organista had indeed been confined at the National Center for Mental Health for treatment, it does not necessarily follow that he still suffered from schizophrenia during the period of the rapes.  No convincing evidence was presented by the defense to show that he had not been in his right mind, or that he had acted under the influence of a sudden attack of insanity, or that he had generally been regarded as insane around the time of the commission of the acts attributed to him.  Well-settled is the rule that an inquiry into the mental state of the accused should relate to the period immediately before or at the very moment the act under prosecution was committed.
[54]
 Mere prior confinement in a mental institution does not prove that the perpetrator was deprived of reason at the time the crimes were committed.
[55]
It must be noted that Organista had been discharged from the mental hospital well before the period of the rapes.  We have held that if the insanity is only occasional or intermittent, the presumption of its continuance does not arise.
[56]
 One who relies on insanity proved at another time must prove its existence also at the time of the commission of the offense.
[57]
To prove his claimed insanity, Organista presented, as an expert witness on his mental condition, Dr. Pia Alma S. de Jesus of the National Center for Mental Health.  It is important to note that she only began treating him beginning April 2001, or two months after the rape incidents,
[58]
 upon orders of the trial court.  Referring to hospital records, she narrated that he had been mentally ill since 1982 or 1983 and had been admitted to the Center a total of 23 times.
[59]
 Prior to the rapes, his last confinement had been from October 27 to December 1, 1997,
[60]
 again for schizophrenia.  Likewise noteworthy is the fact that this period covering his last admission and discharge prior to the rapes was outside that of the commission thereof â January 23 to February 14, 2001.  Dr. De Jesus further testified that Organista had already been considered treated on the date of his discharge in 1997.
[61]
 Though she opined that a patient who did not continue to take medications could suffer a relapse, she did not categorically state whether Organista had suffered such a relapse before the commissions of the rape.
On the other hand, the prosecution has sufficiently established that Organista knew exactly what he was doing.  His going to the house of Arevalo and either directly or indispensably cooperating with him â day after day to ravish the victims â could not have been the act of one so insane as to be incapable of entertaining a criminal intent.  On February 14, 2001, specifically, Organista continued to ravish AcuÃ±a after being coaxed by Arevalo, â
Kaya mo yan pre.
â
[62]
 That Organista persisted in the act all the way to its consummation leaves no doubt that it was voluntary, conscious and deliberate.  Moreover, his attempt to flee when the police officers came to arrest him shows that he knew that what he had done was condemnable.
Furthermore, Organistaâs claimed amnesia does not preclude culpability.  This charade is evidently a desperate ploy for exculpation.  Failure to remember does not in itself prove the existence of such mental condition at the time the crime was committed.
[63]
The testimony of Organista himself militates against his credibility and puts his purported amnesia into serious question.  During trial, he said that he could not remember where he had been from January 23 to 26, 2001.  Surprisingly, he could remember perfectly well the number of times he had been treated at the National Center for Mental Health since 1983, what procedure he had gone through each time he was treated, the kind of medicine he had been given, the number of times Appellant Arevalo had borrowed money from him without paying, the total amount of money he had lent the former, and the resentment the latter had often felt whenever his friend would not repay him.  Moreover, he could narrate in complete detail his fabricated story of how he had allegedly met the victims on February 14, 2001, and lent them money only to be later arrested for rape.
[64]
 The prosecution aptly point out that his selective amnesia and mental dishonesty speak eloquently of his total lack of credibility on the witness stand.
Finally, Organista is not entitled to the mitigating circumstance under Article 13(9) of the Revised Penal Code, because it was not shown that his mental illness at the time immediately preceding or at the very moment of the commission of the crime diminished his will power.
Civil Liability
The trial courtâs award of damages should be modified.  Prevailing jurisprudence holds that for each count of 
simple rape
, the victim should be awarded P50,000 as civil indemnity and another P50,000 as moral damages for the injury evidently suffered.
[65]
 This Court has granted moral damages to victims of rape without need of proof other than the fact of rape, which by itself shows the factual basis for the award.
[66]
 The award of P100,000 to each of the victims by way of exemplary damages should be deleted, because no aggravating circumstance was proven.
WHEREFORE
, the October 26, 2001 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City (Branch 62), finding appellants guilty of qualified rape, is
