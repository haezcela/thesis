THE NATIONAL LIGA NG MGA BARANGAY, REPRESENTED BY ALEX L. DAVID IN HIS CAPACITY AS NATIONAL PRESIDENT AND FOR HIS OWN PERSON, PRESIDENT ALEX L. DAVID, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. VICTORIA ISABEL A.

RAYOS, RESPONDENTS.

LEANDRO YANGOT, BONIFACIO LACWASAN AND BONY TACIO, PETITIONERS, VS. DILG SECRETARY ROBERT Z. BARBERS AND DILG UNDERSECRETARY MANUEL SANCHEZ, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




TINGA, J,:


At bottom, the present petition inquires into the essential nature of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 and questions the extent of the power of Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), as 
alter ego
 of the President.  More immediately, the petition disputes the validity of the appointment of the DILG as the 
interim caretaker
 of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.
On 11 June 1997, private respondent Manuel A. Rayos [as petitioner therein], 
Punong Barangay
 of
 Barangay 
52, District II, Zone 5, District II, Caloocan City, filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus, with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order and damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan,
[1]
 alleging that respondent therein Alex L. David [now petitioner], 
Punong Barangay
 of
 Barangay 
77, Zone 7, Caloocan City and then president of the
 Liga
 Chapter of Caloocan City and of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 National Chapter, committed certain irregularities in the notice, venue and conduct of the proposed synchronized 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 elections in 1997.  According to the petition, the irregularities consisted of the following: (1) the publication of the notice in the 
Manila Bulletin
 but without notifying in writing the individual 
punong barangays
 of Caloocan City;
[2]
 (2) the Notice of Meeting dated 08 June 1997 for the
 Liga
 Chapter of Caloocan City did not specify whether the meeting scheduled on 14 June 1997 was to be held at 8:00 a.m. or 8:00 p.m., and worse, the meeting was to be held in Lingayen, Pangasinan;
[3]
 and (3) the deadline for the filing of the Certificates of Candidacy having been set at 5:00 p.m. of the third âday prior to the above election dayâ, or on 11 June 1997,
[4]
 Rayos failed to meet  said deadline since he was not able to obtain a certified true copy of the COMELEC Certificate of Canvas and Proclamation of Winning Candidate, which were needed to be a delegate, to vote and be voted for in the
 Liga
 election.  On 13 June 1997, the Executive Judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO), effective for seventy-two (72) hours, enjoining the holding of the general membership and election meeting of
 Liga
 Chapter of Caloocan City on 14 June 1975.
[5]
However, the TRO was allegedly not properly served on herein petitioner David, and so the election for the officers of the
 Liga
-Caloocan was held as scheduled.
[6]
 Petitioner David was proclaimed President of the
 Liga
-Caloocan, and thereafter took his oath and assumed the position of 
ex-officio
 member of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Caloocan.
On 17 July 1997, respondent Rayos filed a second petition, this time for 
quo warranto
, mandamus and prohibition, with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order and damages, against David, Nancy Quimpo, Presiding Officer of the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Caloocan City, and Secretary Barbers.
[7]
 Rayos alleged that he was elected President of the
 Liga
 Caloocan Chapter in the elections held on 14 June 1997 by the members of the Caloocan Chapter pursuant to their Resolution/Petition No. 001-97.
[8]
 On 18 July 1997, the presiding judge granted the TRO, enjoining therein respondents David, Quimpo and Secretary Barbers from proceeding with the synchronized elections for the Provincial and Metropolitan Chapters of the
 Liga
 scheduled on 19 July 1997, but only for the purpose of maintaining the 
status quo
 and effective for a period not exceeding seventy-two (72) hours.
[9]
Eventually, on 18 July 1997, at petitioner Davidâs instance, Special Civil Action (SCA) No. C-512 pending before Branch 126 was consolidated with SCA No. C-508 pending before Branch 124.
[10]
Before the consolidation of the cases, on 25 July 1997, the DILG through respondent Secretary Barbers, filed in SCA No. C-512 an 
Urgent Motion
,
[11]
 invoking the Presidentâs power of general supervision over all local government units and seeking the following reliefs:
WHEREFORE, in the interest of the much-needed delivery of basic services to the people, the maintenance of public order and to further protect the interests of the forty-one thousand barangays all over the country, herein respondent respectfully prays: 
 
 
a) 
 
That the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), pursuant to its delegated power of general supervision, be appointed as the Interim Caretaker to manage and administer the affairs of the
 Liga
, until such time that the new set of National
 Liga
 Officers shall have been duly elected and assumed office; ...
[12]
 
 
The prayer for injunctive reliefs was anchored on the following grounds: (1) the DILG Secretary exercises the power of general supervision over all government  units by virtue of Administrative Order No. 267 dated 18 February 1992; (2) the Liga ng mga Barangay is a government organization; (3) undue interference by some local elective officials during the Municipal and City Chapter elections  of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
; (4) improper issuance of confirmations of the elected
 Liga
 Chapter officers by petitioner David and the National
 Liga
 Board; (5) the need for the DILG to provide remedies measured in view of the confusion and chaos sweeping the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 and the incapacity of the National
 Liga
 Board to address the problems properly.
On 31 July 1997, petitioner David opposed the DILGâs 
Urgent Motion
, claiming that the DILG, being a respondent in the case, is not allowed to seek any sanction against a co-respondent like David, such as by filing a cross-claim, without first seeking leave of court.
[13]
 He also alleged that the DILGâs request to be appointed interim caretaker constitutes undue interference in the internal affairs of the
 Liga
, since the
 Liga
 is not subject to DILG control and supervision.
[14]
Three (3) days after filing its 
Urgent Motion
, on 28 July 1997, and before it was acted upon by the lower court, the DILG through then Undersecretary Manuel Sanchez, issued Memorandum Circular No. 97-176.
[15]
 It cited the reported violations of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 Constitution and By-Laws by David and âwidespread chaos and confusionâ among local government officials as to who were the qualified ex-officio
 Liga
 members in their respective 
sangunians
.
[16]
 Pending the appointment of the DILG âas the 
Interim Caretaker
 of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 by the court and until the officers and board members of the national
 Liga
 Chapter have been elected and have assumed office,â the Memorandum Circular directed all provincial governors, vice governors, city mayors, city vice mayors, members of the 
sangguniang panlalawigan
 and 
panlungsod
, DILG regional directors and other concerned officers, as follows:
All concerned are directed not to recognize and/or honor any Liga Presidents of the Provincial and Metropolitan Chapters as ex-officio members of the sanggunian concerned until further notice from the Courts or this Department;
All concerned are directed to disregard any pronouncement and/or directive issued by Mr. Alex David on any issue or matter relating to the affairs of the Liga ng mga Barangay until further notice from the Courts or this Department.
[17]
On 04 August 1997, public respondent Judge Victoria Isabel A. Paredes issued the assailed order,
[18]
 the pertinent portions of which read, thus:
The authority of the DILG to exercise general supervisory jurisdiction over local government units, including the different leagues created under the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) finds basis in Administrative Order No. 267 dated February 18, 1992.  Specifically, Section 1 (a) of the said Administrative Order provides a broad premise for the supervisory power of the DILG.  Administratively, the DILGâs supervision has been tacitly recognized by the local barangays, municipalities, cities and provinces as shown by the evidences presented by respondent David himself (See Annexes âAâ to âCâ).  The fact that the DILG has sought to refer the matters therein to the National
 Liga
 Board/Directorate does not 
ipso facto
 mean that it has lost jurisdiction to act directly therein.  Jurisdiction is conferred by law and cannot be claimed or lost through agreements or inaction by individuals.  What respondent David may term as âinterferenceâ should caretakership be allowed, this Court would rather view as a necessary and desirable corollary to the exercise of supervision.
[19]
Political motivations must not preclude, hamper, or obstruct the delivery of basic services and the perquisites of public service.  In this case, the fact of confusion arising from conflicting appointments, non-action, and uninformed or wavering decisions of the incumbent National Liga Board/Directorate, having been satisfactorily established, cannot simply be brushed aside as being politically motivated or arising therefrom.  It is incumbent, therefore, that the DILG exercise a more active role in the supervision of the affairs and operations of the National Liga Board/ Directorate at least until such time that the regular National Liga Board/Directorate may have been elected, qualified and assumed office.
[20]
xxx
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Urgent Motion of the DILG for appointment as interim caretaker, until such time that the regularly elected National Liga Board of Directors shall have qualified and assumed office, to manage and administer the affairs of the National Liga Board, is hereby GRANTED.
[21]
On 11 August 1997, petitioner David filed an urgent motion for the reconsideration of the assailed order and to declare respondent Secretary Barbers in contempt of Court.
[22]
 David claimed that the 04 August 1997 order divested the duly elected members of the Board of Directors of the
 Liga
 National Directorate of their positions without due process of law.  He also wanted Secretary Barbers declared in contempt for having issued, through his Undersecretary, Memorandum Circular No. 97-176, even before respondent judge issued the questioned order, in mockery of the justice system.  He implied that Secretary Barbers knew about respondent judgeâs questioned order even before it was promulgated.
[23]
On 11 August 1997, the DILG issued Memorandum Circular No. 97-193,
[24]
 providing supplemental guidelines for the 1997 synchronized elections of the provincial and metropolitan chapters and for the election of the national chapter of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
. The Memorandum Circular set the synchronized elections for the provincial and metropolitan chapters on 23 August 1997 and for the national chapter on 06 September 1997.
On 12 August 1997, the DILG issued a Certificate of Appointment
[25]
 in favor of respondent Rayos as president of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 of Caloocan City.  The appointment purportedly served as Rayosâs âlegal basis for 
ex-officio
 membership in the 
Sangguniang Panlungsod
 of Caloocan Cityâ and âto qualify and participate in the forthcoming National Chapter Election of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.â
[26]
On 23 August 1997, the DILG conducted the synchronized elections of Provincial and Metropolitan
 Liga
 Chapters. Thereafter, on 06 September 1997, the National
 Liga
 Chapter held its election of officers and board of directors, wherein James Marty L. Lim was elected as President of the National
 Liga
.
[27]
On 01 October 1997, public respondent judge denied Davidâs motion for reconsideration,
[28]
 ruling that there was no factual or legal basis to reconsider the appointment of the DILG as interim caretaker of the National
 Liga
 Board and to cite Secretary Barbers in contempt of court.
[29]
On 10 October 1997, petitioners filed the instant 
Petition for Certiorari
[30]
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking to annul public respondent judgeâs orders of 04 August 1997 and 01 October 1997.  They dispute the latterâs opinion on the power of supervision of the President under the Constitution, through the DILG over local governments, which is the same as that of the DILGâs as shown by its application of the power on the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.  Specifically, they claim that the public respondent judgeâs  designation of the DILG as interim caretaker and the acts which the DILG  sought to implement pursuant to its designation as such are beyond the scope of the Chief Executiveâs power of supervision.
To support the petition, petitioners argue that under Administrative Order No. 267, Series of 1992, the power of general supervision of the President over local government units does not apply to the
 Liga
 and its various chapters precisely because the
 Liga
 is not a local government unit, contrary to the stance of the respondents.
[31]
Section 507 of the Local Government Code (Republic Act No. 7160)
[32]
 provides that the
 Liga
 shall be governed by its own Constitution and By-laws.  Petitioners posit that the duly elected officers and directors of the National
 Liga
 elected in 1994 had a vested right to their positions and could only be removed therefrom for cause by affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the entire membership pursuant to the
 Liga
 Constitution and By-Laws, and not by mere issuances of the DILG, even if bolstered by the dubious authorization of respondent judge.
[33]
 Thus, petitioners claim that the questioned order divested the then incumbent officers and directors of the
 Liga
 of their right to their respective offices without due process of law.
Assuming the
 Liga
 could be subsumed under the term âlocal governments,â over which the President, through the DILG Secretary, has the power of supervision,
[34]
 petitioners point out that still there is no legal or constitutional basis for the appointment of the DILG as interim caretaker.
[35]
 They stress that the actions contemplated by the DILG as interim caretaker go beyond supervision, as what it had sought and obtained was authority to alter, modify, nullify or set aside the actions of the
 Liga
 Board of Directors  and even to substitute its judgment over that of the latter â which are all clearly one of control.
[36]
 Petitioners question the appointment of Rayos as
 Liga
-Caloocan President since at that time petitioner David was occupying that position which was still the subject of the quo 
warranto
 proceedings Rayos himself had instituted.
[37]
 Petitioners likewise claim that DILG Memorandum Circular No. 97-193, providing supplemental guidelines for the synchronized elections of the
 Liga
, replaced the implementing rules adopted by the
 Liga
 pursuant to its Constitution and By-laws.
[38]
 In fact, even before its appointment as interim caretaker, DILG specifically enjoined all heads of government units from recognizing petitioner David and/or honoring any of his pronouncements relating to the
 Liga
.
[39]
Petitioners rely on decision in 
Taule v. Santos
,
[40]
 which, they claim, already passed upon the âextent of authority of the then Secretary of Local Government over the 
katipunan ng mga
 barangay 
or the barangay councils,â as it specifically ruled that the âSecretary [of Local Government] has no authority to pass upon the validity or regularity of the election of officers of the katipunan.â
[41]
For his part, respondent Rayos avers that since the Secretary of the DILG supervises the acts of local officials by ensuring that they act within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions and since members of the various leagues, such as the
 Liga
 in this case, are themselves officials of local government units, it follows that the
 Liga
 members are subject to the power of supervision of the DILG.
[42]
 He adds that as the DILGâs management and administration of the
 Liga
 affairs was limited only to the conduct of the elections, its actions were consistent with its rule-making power and power of supervision under existing laws.
[43]
 He asserts that in assailing the appointment of the DILG as interim caretaker, petitioners failed to cite any provision of positive law in support of their stance. Thus, he adds, âif a law is silent, obscure or insufficient, a judge may apply a rule he sees fit to resolve the issue, as long as the rule chosen is in harmony with general interest, order, morals and public policy,â
[44]
 in consonance with Article 9 of the Civil Code.
[45]
On the other hand, it is quite significant that the Solicitor General has shared petitionersâ position.  He states that the DILGâs act of managing and administering the affairs of the National
 Liga
 Board are not merely acts of supervision but plain manifestations of control and direct takeover of the functions of the National
 Liga
 Board,
[46]
 going beyond the limits of the power of general supervision of the President over local governments.
[47]
 Moreover, while the
 Liga
 may be deemed a government organization, it is not strictly a local government unit over which the DILG has supervisory power.
[48]
Meanwhile, on 24 September 1998, James Marty L. Lim, the newly elected President of the National
 Liga
, filed a 
Motion for Leave to File Comment in Intervention
,
[49]
 with his 
Comment in Intervention
 attached,
[50]
 invoking the validity of the DILGâs actions relative to the conduct of the
 Liga
 elections.
[51]
 In addition, he sought the dismissal of the instant petition on the following grounds: (1) the issue of validity or invalidity of the questioned order has been rendered moot and academic by the election of
 Liga
 officers; (2) the turn-over of the administration and management of
 Liga
 affairs to the
 Liga
 officers; and (3) the recognition and acceptance by the members of the
 Liga
 nationwide.
[52]
In the interim, another petition, this time for 
Prohibition with Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order
, 
[53]
 was filed by several presidents of
 Liga
 Chapters, praying that this Court declare the DILG Secretary and Undersecretary are not vested with any constitutional or legal power to exercise control or even supervision over the National 
Liga ng mga Barangay
, nor to take over the functions of its officers or suspend its constitution; and declare void any and all acts committed by respondents therein in connection with their caretakership of the
 Liga
.
[54]
 The petition was consolidated with G.R. No. 130775, but it was eventually dismissed because the petitioners failed to submit an affidavit of service and proof of service of the petition.
[55]
Meanwhile, on 01 December 1998, petitioner David died and was substituted by his legal representatives.
[56]
Petitioners have raised a number of issues.
[57]
 Integrated and simplified, these issues boil down to the question of whether or not respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in appointing the DILG as 
interim
 caretaker to administer and manage the affairs of the National
 Liga
 Board, per its order dated 04 August 1997.
[58]
 In turn, the resolution of the question of grave abuse of discretion entails a couple of definitive issues, namely: (1)  whether the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 is a government organization that is subject to the DILG Secretaryâs power of supervision over local governments as the 
alter ego
 of the President, and (2) whether the respondent Judgeâs designation of the DILG as interim caretaker of the
 Liga
 has invested the DILG with control over the
 Liga
 and whether DILG Memorandum Circular No. 97-176, issued before it was designated as such 
interim
 caretaker, and DILG Memorandum Circular No. 97-193 and other acts which the DILG made in its capacity as interim caretaker of the
 Liga
, involve supervision or control of the
 Liga
.
However, the Court should first address the question of mootness which intervenor Lim raised because, according to him, during the pendency of the present petition a general election was held; the new set of officers and directors had assumed their positions; and that supervening events the DILG had turned-over the management and administration of the
 Liga
 to new
 Liga
 officers and directors.
[59]
 Respondent Rayos has joined him in this regard.
[60]
 Forthwith, the Court declares that these supervening events have not rendered the instant petition moot, nor removed it from the jurisdiction of this Court.
This case transcends the elections ordered and conducted by the DILG as interim caretaker of the
 Liga
 and the
 Liga
 officers and directors who were elected to replace petitioner David and the former officers.  At the core of the petition is the validity of the DILGâs âcaretakershipâ of the
 Liga
 and the official acts of the DILG as such caretaker which exceeded the bounds of supervision and were exercise of control.  At stake in this case is the realization of the constitutionally ensconced principle of local government autonomy;
[61]
 the statutory objective to enhance the capabilities of barangays and municipalities âby providing them opportunities to participate actively in the implementation of national programs and projects;â
[62]
 and the promotion of the avowed aim to ensure the independence and non-partisanship of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.  The mantle of local autonomy would be eviscerated and remain an empty buzzword if unconstitutional, illegal and unwarranted intrusions in the affairs of the local governments are tolerated and left unchecked.
Indeed, it is the declared policy of the State that its territorial and political subdivisions should enjoy genuine meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals.
[63]
 In the case of 
De Leon v. Esguerra
,
[64]
 the Court ruled that even barangays are meant to possess genuine and meaningful local autonomy so that they may develop fully as self-reliant communities.
[65]
Furthermore, well-entrenched is the rule that courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is âcapable of repetition, yet evading review.â
[66]
 For the question of whether the DILG may validly be appointed as interim caretaker, or assume a similar position and perform acts pursuant thereto, is likely to resurrect again, and yet the question may not be decided before the actual assumption, or the termination of said assumption even.
So too, dismissing the petition on the ground of mootness could lead to the wrong impression that the challenged order and issuances are valid. Verily, that does not appear to be the correct conclusion to make since by applying opposite precedents to the issues the outcome points to invalidating the assailed order and memorandum circulars.
The resolution of the issues of whether the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 is subject to DILG supervision, and whether the questioned âcaretakershipâ order of the respondent judge and the challenged issuances and acts of the DILG constitute control in derogation of the Constitution, necessitates a brief overview of the 
barangay
, as the lowest LGU, and the
 Liga
, as a vehicle of governance and coordination.
As the basic political unit, the barangay serves as the primary planning and implementing unit of government policies, plans, programs, projects and activities in the community, and as a forum wherein the collective views of the people may be expressed, crystallized and considered, and where disputes may be amicably settled.
[67]
On the other hand, the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
[68]
 is the organization of all 
barangays
, the primary purpose of which is the determination of the representation of the
 Liga
 in the 
sanggunians
, and the ventilation, articulation, and crystallization of issues affecting
 barangay 
government administration and securing solutions thereto, through proper and legal means.
[69]
  The 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 shall have chapters at the municipal, city and provincial and metropolitan political subdivision levels.
[70]
 The municipal and city chapters of the
 Liga
 are composed of the
 barangay 
representatives from the municipality or city concerned.  The presidents of the municipal and city chapters of the
 Liga
 form the provincial or metropolitan political subdivision chapters of the
 Liga
.  The presidents of the chapters of the
 Liga
 in highly urbanized cities, provinces and the Metro Manila area and other metropolitan political subdivisions constitute the National 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.
[71]
As conceptualized in the Local Government Code, the
 barangay 
is positioned to influence and direct the development of the entire country.  This was heralded by the adoption of the bottom-to-top approach process of development which requires the development plans of the
 barangay 
to be considered in the development plans of the municipality, city or province,
[72]
 whose plans in turn are to be taken into account by the central government
[73]
 in its plans for the development of the entire country.
[74]
 The
 Liga
 is the vehicle assigned to make this new development approach materialize and produce results.
The presidents of the
 Liga
 at the municipal, city and provincial levels, automatically become 
ex-officio
 members of the 
Sangguniang Bayan, Sangguniang Panlungsod
 and 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
, respectively.  They shall serve as such only during their term of office as presidents of the
 Liga
 chapters, which in no case shall be beyond the term of office of the 
sanggunian
 concerned.
[75]
The 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 has one principal aim, namely: to promote the development of 
barangays
 and secure the general welfare of their inhabitants.
[76]
 In line with this, the
 Liga
 is granted the following functions and duties: 
 
 
a)
 
 
Give priority to programs designed for the total development of the barangays and in consonance with the policies, programs and projects of the national government;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)
 
 
Assist in the education of barangay residents for peopleâs participation in local government administration in order to promote untied and concerted action to achieve country-wide development goals;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) 
 
Supplement the efforts of government in creating gainful employment within the barangay;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d)
 
 
Adopt measures to promote the welfare of barangay officials;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e)
 
 
Serve as forum of the barangays in order to forge linkages with government and non-governmental organizations and thereby promote the social, economic and political well-being of the barangays; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
f)
 
 
Exercise such other powers and perform such other duties and functions which will bring about stronger ties between barangays and promote the welfare of the barangay inhabitants.
[77]
 
 
The
 Ligas
 are primarily governed by the provisions of the Local Government Code.  However, they are empowered to make their own constitution and by-laws to govern their operations. Sec. 507 of the Code provides:
Sec. 507. 
Constitution and By-Laws of the
 Liga
 
and the Leagues
. - All other matters not herein otherwise provided for affecting the internal organization of the leagues of local government units shall be governed by their respective constitution and by-laws which are hereby made suppletory to the provision of this Chapter: 
Provided
, That said Constitution and By-laws shall always conform to the provision of the Constitution and existing laws.
Pursuant to the Local Government Code, the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 adopted its own Constitution and By-Laws.  It provides that the corporate powers of the
 Liga
, expressed or implied, shall be vested in the board of directors of each level of the
 Liga
 which shall: 
a) Have jurisdiction over all officers, directors and committees of the said Liga; including the power of appointment, assignment and delegation;
b) Have general management of the business, property, and funds of said Liga;
c) Prepare and approve a budget showing anticipated receipts and expenditures for the year, including the plans or schemes for funding purposes; and
d) Have the power to suspend or remove from office any officer or member of the said board on grounds cited and in the manner provided in hereinunder provisions.
[78]
The National
 Liga
 Board of Directors promulgated the rules for the conduct of its
 Liga
âs general elections.
[79]
 And, as early as 28 April 1997, the
 Liga
 National Chapter had already scheduled its general elections on 14 June 1997.
[80]
The controlling provision on the issues at hand is Section 4, Article X of the Constitution, which reads in part:
Sec. The President of the Philippines shall exercise general supervision over local governments.
The 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions uniformly differentiate the Presidentâs power of supervision over local governments and his power of control of the executive departments bureaus and offices.
[81]
 Similar to the counterpart provisions in the earlier Constitutions, the provision in the 1987 Constitution provision has been interpreted to exclude the power of control.
[82]
In the early case of 
Mondano v. Silvosa, et al
.,
[83]
 this Court defined supervision as âoverseeing, or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties, and to take such action as prescribed by law to compel his subordinates to perform their duties.  Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.
[84]
 In 
Taule v. Santos
,
[85]
 the Court held that the Constitution permits the President to wield no more authority than that of checking whether a local government or its officers perform their duties as provided by statutory enactments.
[86]
 Supervisory power, when contrasted with control, is the power of mere oversight over an inferior body; it does not include any restraining authority over such body.
[87]
The case of 
Drilon v. Lim
[88]
 clearly defined the extent of supervisory power, thus:
â¦The supervisor or superintendent merely sees to it that the rules are followed, but he himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to modify or replace them.  If the rules are not observed, he may order the work done or re-done but only to conform to the prescribed rules.  He may not prescribe his own manner for the doing of the act.  He has no judgment on this matter except to see that the rules are followedâ¦
[89]
In Section 4, Article X of the Constitution applicable to the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
?  Otherwise put, is the
 Liga
 legally susceptible to DILG suspension?
This question was resolved in 
Bito-Onon v. Fernandez
,
[90]
 where the Court ruled that the Presidentâs power of the general supervision, as exercised therein by the DILG Secretary as his 
alter ego
, extends to the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.
Does the Presidentâs power of general supervision extend to the liga ng mga barangay, which is not a local government unit?
We rule in the affirmative.  In Opinion No. 41, Series of 1995, the Department of Justice ruled that the liga ng mga barangay is a government organization, being an association, federation, league or union created by law or by authority of law, whose members are either appointed or elected government officials.  The Local Government Code defines the liga ng mga barangay as an organization of all barangays for the primary purpose of determining the representation of the liga in the sanggunians, and for ventilating, articulating and crystallizing issues affecting barangay government administration and securing, through proper and legal means, solutions thereto.
[91]
The rationale for making the
 Liga
 subject to DILG supervision is quite evident, whether from the perspectives of logic or of practicality.  The
 Liga
 is an aggroupment of 
barangays
 which are in turn represented therein by their respective 
punong barangays
.  The representatives of the
 Liga
 sit in an 
ex officio
 capacity at the municipal, city and provincial 
sanggunians
.  As such, they enjoy all the powers and discharge all the functions of regular municipal councilors, city councilors or provincial board members, as the case may be.  Thus, the
 Liga
 is the vehicle through which the
 barangay 
participates in the enactment of ordinances and formulation of policies at all the legislative local levels higher than the 
sangguniang barangay
, at the same time serving as the mechanism for the bottom-to-top approach of development.
In the case at bar, even before the respondent Judge designated the DILG as 
interim
 caretaker of the
 Liga
, on 28 July 1997, it issued Memorandum Circular No. 97-176, directing local government officials not to recognize David as the National
 Liga
 President and his pronouncements relating to the affairs of the
 Liga
.  Not only was the action premature, it even smacked of superciliousness and injudiciousness. The DILG is the topmost government agency which maintains coordination with, and exercises supervision over local government units and its multi-level leagues.  As such, it should be forthright, circumspect and supportive in its dealings with the 
Ligas
 especially the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
.  The indispensable role played by the latter in the development of the barangays  and the promotion of the welfare of the inhabitants thereof deserve no less than the full support and respect of the  other agencies of government.  As the Court held in the case of 
San Juan v. Civil Service Commission
,
[92]
 our national officials should not only comply with the constitutional provisions on local autonomy but should also appreciate the spirit of liberty upon which these provisions are based.
[93]
When the respondent judge eventually appointed the DILG as interim caretaker to manage and administer the affairs of the 
Liga
, she effectively removed the management from the National
 Liga 
Board and vested control of the
 Liga 
on the DILG.  Even a cursory glance at the DILGâs prayer for appointment as interim caretaker of the
 Liga 
âto 
manage and administer the affairs of the 
Liga
, until such time that the new set of National
 Liga 
officers shall have been duly elected and assumed officeâ reveals that what the DILG wanted was to take control over the 
Liga
. Even if said âcaretakershipâ was contemplated to last for a limited time, or only until a new set of officers assume office, the fact remains that it was a conferment of control in derogation of the Constitution.
With his Department already appointed as interim caretaker of the 
Liga
, Secretary Barbers nullified the results of the
 Liga 
elections and promulgated DILG Memorandum Circular No. 97-193 dated 11 August 1997, where he laid down the supplemental guidelines for the 1997 synchronized elections of the provincial and metropolitan chapters and for the election of the national chapter of the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
; scheduled dates for the new provincial, metropolitan and national chapter elections; and appointed respondent Rayos as president of 
Liga
-Caloocan Chapter.
These acts of the DILG went beyond the sphere of general supervision and constituted direct interference with the political affairs, not only of the 
Liga
, but more importantly, of the barangay as an institution.  The election of
 Liga 
officers is part of the 
Liga
âs internal organization, for which the latter has already provided guidelines. In succession, the DILG assumed stewardship and jurisdiction over the
 Liga 
affairs, issued supplemental guidelines for the election, and nullified the effects of the 
Liga
-conducted elections.  Clearly, what the DILG wielded was the power of control which even the President does not have.
Furthermore, the DILG assumed control when it appointed respondent Rayos as president of the 
Liga
-Caloocan Chapter prior to the newly scheduled general
 Liga 
elections, although petitioner Davidâs term had not yet expired.  The DILG substituted its choice, who was Rayos, over the choice of majority of the 
punong barangay
 of Caloocan, who was the incumbent President, petitioner David.  The latter was elected and had in fact been sitting as an 
ex-officio
 member of the 
sangguniang panlungsod
 in accordance with the
 Liga 
Constitution and By-Laws.  Yet, the DILG extended the appointment to respondent Rayos although it was aware that the position was the subject of a 
quo warranto
 proceeding instituted by Rayos himself, thereby preempting the outcome of that case.  It was bad enough that the DILG assumed the power of control, it was worse when it made use of the power with evident bias and partiality.
As the entity exercising supervision over the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
, the DILGâs authority over the
 Liga 
is limited to seeing to it that the rules are followed, but it cannot lay down such rules itself, nor does it have the discretion to modify or replace them.  In this particular case, the most that the DILG could do was review the acts of the incumbent officers of the
 Liga 
in the conduct of the elections to determine if they committed any violation of the 
Liga
âs Constitution and By-laws and its implementing rules. If the National
 Liga 
Board and its officers had violated
 Liga 
rules, the DILG should have ordered the
 Liga 
to conduct another election in accordance with the 
Liga
âs own rules, but not in obeisance to DILG-dictated guidelines.  Neither had the DILG the authority to remove the incumbent officers of the
 Liga 
and replace them, even temporarily, with unelected
 Liga 
officers.
Like the local government units, the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 is not subject to control by the Chief Executive or his alter ego.
In the 
Bito-Onon
[94]
 case, this Court held that DILG Memorandum Circular No. 97-193, insofar as it authorized the filing of a petition for review of the decision of the Board of Election Supervisors (BES) with the regular courts in a post-proclamation electoral protest, involved the exercise of control as it in effect amended the guidelines already promulgated by the 
Liga
.  The decision reads in part:
xxx.  Officers in control, lay down the rules in the doing of an act.  If they are not followed, it is discretionary on his part to order the act undone or redone by his subordinate or he may even decide to do it himself.  Supervision does not cover such authority.  Supervising officers merely see to it that the rules are followed, but he himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to modify or replace them.  If the rules are not observed, he may order the work done or re-done to conform for to the prescribed rules. He cannot prescribe his own manner the doing of the act.
x x x
xxx. The amendment of the GUIDELINES is more than an exercise of the power of supervision but is an exercise of the power of control, which the President does not have over the LIGA.  Although the DILG is given the power to prescribe rules, regulations and other issuances, the Administrative Code limits its authority to merely âmonitoring compliance by local government units of such issuances.  To monitor means to âwatch, observe or checkâ and is compatible with the power of supervision of the DILG Secretary over local governments, which is limited to checking whether  the local government unit concerned or the officers thereof perform their duties as per statutory enactments.  Besides, any doubt as to the power of the DILG Secretary to interfere with local affairs should be resolved in favor of the greater autonomy of the local government.
[95]
In 
Taule
,
[96]
 the Court ruled that the Secretary of Local Government had no authority to pass upon the validity or regularity of the election of officers of 
katipunan ng mga
 barangay 
or barangay councils.  In that case, a protest was lodged before the Secretary of Local Government regarding several irregularities in, and seeking the nullification of, the election of officers of the Federation of Associations of Barangay Councils (FABC) of Catanduanes. Then Local Government Secretary Luis Santos issued a resolution nullifying the election of officers and ordered a new one to be conducted. The Court ruled:
Construing the constitutional limitation on the power of general supervision of the President over local governments, We hold that respondent Secretary has no authority to pass upon the validity or regularity of the officers of the 
katipunan
.  To allow respondent Secretary to do so will give him more power than the law or the Constitution grants.  It will in effect give him control over local government officials for it will permit him to interfere in a purely democratic and non-partisan activity aimed at strengthening the barangay as the basic component of local governments so that the ultimate goal of fullest autonomy may be achieved.  In fact, his order that the new elections to be conducted be presided by the Regional Director is a clear and direct interference by the Department with the political affairs of the barangays which is not permitted by the limitation of presidential power to general supervision over local governments.
[97]
All given, the Court is convinced that the assailed order was issued with grave abuse of discretion while the acts of the respondent Secretary, including DILG Memorandum Circulars No. 97-176 and No. 97-193, are unconstitutional and 
ultra vires
, as they all entailed the conferment or exercise of control â a power which is denied by the Constitution even to the President.
WHEREFORE, the 
Petition
 is GRANTED.  The 
Order
 of the Regional Trial Court dated 04 August 1997 is SET ASIDE for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. DILG Memorandum Circulars No. 97-176 and No. 97-193, are declared VOID for being unconstitutional and 
ultra vires
.
No pronouncements as to costs.

 The forerunner of the 
liga ng mga barangay
 is the 
katipunan ng mga
 barangay 
under Section 108 of B.P. Blg. 337, which was known as the 
katipunan bayan
 in municipalities, 
katipunang panglungsod
 in cities, 
katipunang panlalawigan
 in provinces, and 
katipunang ng mga
 barangay 
on the national level.  Each
 barangay 
therein was represented by the 
punong barangay
.  The 
katipunang bayan
 was also referred to as the Association of
 Barangay 
councils or ABC for short.  Pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 146 of B.P. 337, the president of the said organization was among the members of the 
sangguniang bayan
