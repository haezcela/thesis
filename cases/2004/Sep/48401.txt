FIRST DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 151963, September 09, 2004 ]


AIR PHILIPPINES CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AVIATION SERVICES PHILS., INC., RESPONDENT. 
DECISION




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Simple negligence of counsel binds the client.  This is especially true in this case in which the client was as negligent as its lawyer.  Hence, petitioner must bear the consequences and accept its defeat.  After all, the winning party did not take advantage of petitionerâs fault, but merely complied with the law in prosecuting its valid and proven claims.
The Case
Before us is a Petition for Review
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the September 28, 2001 Decision
[2]
 and the January 25, 2002 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 64283.  The dispositive part of the assailed Decision reads:
âIN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING
, the appeal of the [petitioner] is partially 
GRANTED
 in that the Decision appealed from is 
AFFIRMED
 with the modification that the award for a brokerâs fee in favor of the [respondent] is deleted.â
[4]
The assailed Resolution denied reconsideration of the Decision.
The Facts
The facts are narrated by the CA as follows:
âThe Air Philippines, Inc., 
API for brevity
, was in need of the services of a business establishment to ferry its B-737 airplane, with Registry Number RP C1938, from the United States of America to the Philippines, 
via 
Subic Bay International Airport, at Olongapo City.  API, through Captain Alex Villacampa, its Vice-President for Operations, engaged the services of 
International Business Aviation Services Phils., Inc., IBASPI for brevity
, as its agent to look for and engage, for API, a business enterprise to ferry the airplane.  IBASPI did engage the services of Universal Weather [&] Aviation, Inc., 
UWAI for brevity
, to ferry the airplane x x x to the Philippines, 
via
 the International Airport at Subic Bay, Olongapo City, where API took delivery of the plane.
âUWAI sent its â
Billings
â
 to API, through IBASPI, in the total amount of US$65,131.55 for its services for the ferry of the airplane.  API failed to pay its account.  On December 2, 1996, the [respondent] wrote a letter to the [petitioner] urging the payment of the bills of UWAI.  The [petitioner] refused.  Exasperated, UWAI blamed IBASPI for the intransigence of API.  IBASPI was impelled to write a letter to UWAI âto clarifyâ critical points of APIâs account.  Unable to bear the pressure of UWAI and to avoid corporate embarrassment for APIâs intransigence, IBASPI was impelled to advance and pay to UWAI the said amount of US$65,131.55 for the account of API.  The latter was informed by UWAI of the payment of said account by IBASPI 
via
 its letter dated May 12, 1997.
âIBASPI forthwith wrote a letter to API demanding refund to IBASPI the amount it advanced to UWAI for the account of API.  IBASPI received, 
via
 an informant, a copy of a â
Memorandum
â
 of Rodolfo Estrellado, the President and Chief Executive Officer of API, dated July 29, 1997, to the President of API, recommending that the latter pay only the amount of US$27,730.60, with a recommendation that IBASPI be required to submit documentations/billings in support of the difference of US$37,400.00.  However, no payment was effected by API.
âOn November 6, 1997, IBASPI, through counsel, sent another letter to API demanding the payment of the said amount of US$65,131.55 and 10% commission.  API ignored the letter.  Another letter of demand was sent to API by IBASPI, on December 1, 1997, to no avail.  On January 6, 1998, IBASPI wrote another letter of demand to API enclosing therein a â
Summary Statement of Account of Air Philippines, Inc
.â on the disputed amount of US $37,400.00, appending thereto the documentations/billings in support of said claim and 10% commission.  On February 26, 1998, API drew Check No. 0521300 against its account, with the Bank of Philippine Islands, in the amount of P200,000.00, payable to the order of IBASPI, and offered the same 
in partial first payment
 of its account with IBASPI for the amount of US$65,131.55 as stated in the letter of the [petitioner].  The [respondent] accepted the said check with a simultaneous â
Receipt/Agreement
â executed by IBASPI and API, the latter, through Atty. Manolito A. Manalo, the Officer-in-Charge of the Legal Department of the API, obliging itself to pay the balance of its account.  API in the said Agreement waived demand by IBASPI.  Despite demands of IBASPI, 
via
 its letter, dated April 22, 1998, API refused to pay the balance of its account with IBASPI.
âOn June 24, 1998, IBASPI filed a complaint against API, with the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, for the collection of its account, including a 10% brokerâs fee, praying that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in its favor as follows:
âWHEREFORE, [respondent] respectfully prays of this Honorable Court to render judgment:
 1) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] the sum of US$59,798.22 x x x or its equivalent in legal tender with interest at the legal rate from May 1997 until full payment;
2) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] further sum of US$6,513.00 or its equivalent in legal tender as intermediaryâs commission;
3) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] another sum of US$13,026.00 or its equivalent in legal tender as actual damages in the form of attorneyâs fees;
4) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the [respondent] expenses of litigation as can be proved;
5) Ordering the [petitioner] to pay the costs of the suit; and,
6) [Respondent] prays for such further or other relief as may be deemed just or equitable.â
 
 âThe [respondent] appended to its complaint the â
Receipt/Agreement
â executed by the [petitioner], on March 20, 1998.  In its â
Unverified Answer
â, API alleged, 
inter alia
, by way of â
Affirmative Allegations
â, that:
â8. In support of the foregoing denials and by way of affirmative allegations, [petitioner] states:
â9. On 6 November 1997, we received a letter from [respondent] demanding payment of $65,131.00 allegedly for the ferry flight services rendered by Universal and brokered by [respondent].
â10. On 1 December 1997 and 12 January 1998, we sent letters to [respondent] acknowledging receipt of their demand letter[.]  However, we mentioned in the letters that we needed time to process the documents submitted by [respondent] to support their claim.
â11. APC made it very clear that if an obligation on the part of [petitioner] is proven to exist, [petitioner] would be more than willing to settle the obligation.
â12. In fact, as mentioned in the complaint, [petitioner] made a payment of 
P
200,000.00 to cover claims which [petitioner] did not contest; [petitioner] opted not to settle the balance of the claim pending verification of the submitted supporting documents.
â13. [Petitioner] verbally requested [respondent] to further substantiate its claim by sending their accountants to the offices of APC[.]
â14. [Respondent] did not heed this request; thus, APC could not release any other amounts to cover the claim of [respondent.]
â15. The documents sent by [respondent] were not accompanied by any explanation and were merely a loose collection of statements from various companies[.]
â16. Thus, [petitioner] was surprised when [respondent] filed the instant complaint[,] for[,] as far as the former [was] concerned[,] the accounting of the claim was nowhere near definite nor clear[.]â 
 âOn November 17, 1998, the Court issued a â
Pre-Trial Notice
â setting the pre-trial conference on December 7, 1998, at 8:30 x x x in the morning, requiring the parties to file their respective â
Pre-Trial Brief
â at least two (2) days before the scheduled pre-trial.  The [respondent] did file its âPre-Trial Briefâ[,] but the [petitioner] did not.  During the pre-trial, on December 7, 1998, Atty. Manolito Manalo, counsel of the [petitioner], appeared[,] but without any â
Special Power of Attorney
â from the [petitioner].  The Court granted the [petitioner] a period of ten (10) days, from said date, within which to file its â
Pre-Trial Brief
â and â
Special Power of Attorney
â executed by the [petitioner] in favor of its counsel.  In the meantime, the pre-trial was reset to January 11, 1999 at the same time.  However, the [petitioner] failed to file its â
Pre-Trial Brief
â.  On January 11, 1999, at 9:20 x x x in the morning, the [petitioner] filed an â
Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for Extension of Time to File Pre-Trial Brief and For Resetting of Pre-Trial Conference
â, with a plea to the Branch Clerk of Court to submit the said motion for consideration of the Court immediately upon receipt thereof.  When the case was called for pre-trial, there was no appearance for the [petitioner] and its counsel.  The Court issued an Order denying the motion of the [petitioner] and allowing the [respondent] to adduce its evidence, 
ex parte
, before the Branch Clerk of Court, who was designated, as Commissioner, to receive the evidence of the [respondent], 
ex parte
.  On January 13, 1999, the [petitioner] filed with the Court another â
Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for Extension of Time to File Pre-Trial Brief and for Resetting of Pre-Trial Conference
â.  On January 15, 1999, the [petitioner] filed a â
Motion for Reconsideration
â of the Order of the Court, dated January 11, 1999.  The [petitioner] appended to its motion the â
Affidavit
â of Atty. Manolito Manalo, its counsel, stating the reason for his failure to appear at the pre-trial conference on January 11, 1999.  On January 22, 1999, the Court issued an Order denying the â
Motion for Reconsideration
â of the [petitioner].  On January 25, 1999, the [respondent] did adduce testimonial and documentary evidence in support of its complaint.
âAmong the documentary evidence adduced by the [respondent] were the xerox copy of the â
Certification
â of Captain Alex Villacampa, and the â
Memorandum
â of Rodolfo Estrellado.
âOn April 7, 1999, the Court rendered judgment in favor of the [respondent] and against the [petitioner], the decretal portion of which reads as follows:
âWHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING uncontroverted and substantiated evidences of the [respondent], judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the [respondent] and against the [petitioner] ordering the latter to pay the former the following:
 
the amount of US59,798.22 dollars or its equivalent in legal tender plus interest at the legal rate from May, 1997 until fully paid;
the amount of US6,513.00 or its equivalent as intermediaryâs commission;
[
P
]50,000.00 as and for attorneyâs fees; and,
 
 Costs of suit.
âSO ORDERED.â 
 âThe [petitioner] filed a â
Motion for New Trial
â on the grounds that:  (a) it was deprived of its day in court due to the gross negligence of its former counsel, Atty. Manolito A. Manalo; (b) the â
Receipt/Agreement
â executed by Atty. Manolito A. Manalo, in behalf of the [petitioner], was unauthorized as there was no â
Resolutionâ
 of the Board of Directors authorizing him to execute said â
Receipt/Agreement
â and, hence, said counsel acted beyond the scope of his authority; (c) the claim of IBASPI was excessive and unjustified; [and] (d) the [petitioner] never agreed to pay the [respondent] a commission of 10% of the billings of UWAI.
âOn July 26, 1999, the Court issued a â
Resolution
â denying the â
Motion for New Trial
â of the [petitioner].  The latter forthwith interposed its appeal, from said Decision and Resolution of the Court 
a quo
.â
[5]
 
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
Affirming the Decision of the lower court with some modification, the CA ruled that under the Rules of Civil Procedure, petitioner could not avail itself of a new trial, because its former counsel was guilty of only simple -- not gross -- negligence.  In addition, petitioner, being equally negligent as its counsel, could not be relieved from the effects of its negligence.  Thus, it was held liable for US$59,798.22 and attorneyâs fees, but not for the 10 percent commission or brokerâs fee, for which the requisite quantum of evidence in its favor had not been mustered by respondent.
Hence this Petition.
[6]
The Issues
Petitioner submits the following issues for our consideration:
â1.  Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it upheld the ruling of the Honorable Trial Court denying the Motion for New Trial dated April 27, 1999 despite the fact that the gross negligence, incompetence and dishonesty of Petitioner APCâs former counsel, Atty. Manolito A. Manalo, have effectively denied Petitioner APC of its day in court.
â2.  Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it took cognizance of and/or gave credence to the âMemorandumâ of Rodolfo Estrellado, and the âBillingsâ of Universal Weather as well as the documents/receipts in support thereof despite the fact that they are clearly hearsay and have no probative value considering that Luisito Nazareno, the lone witness of Respondent IBAS, had no personal knowledge of the contents and/or factual bases thereof and failed to properly authenticate and/or identify the same.
â3.  Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it took cognizance of and/or gave credence to the Receipt/Agreement dated March 20, 1998 despite the fact that Atty. Manolito A. Manalo was not authorized to execute [the] same for and [in] behalf of Petitioner APC.
â4.  Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it upheld the ruling of the Honorable Trial Court that Petitioner APC is liable to pay and/or reimburse Respondent IBAS for the payments allegedly made by the latter to Universal Weather despite the fact that the claims submitted by Universal Weather and/or Respondent IBAS were patently baseless and/or unsubstantiated.
â5.  Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals ruled in accordance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it upheld the ruling of the Honorable Trial Court that Respondent IBAS is entitled to legal interest and attorneyâs fees despite the fact that it has failed to establish its claims against Petitioner APC.â
[7]
 
 These issues all boil down into two: 
first
, whether the Motion for New Trial should be denied; and 
second
, in the event of such denial, whether the monetary awards were duly proven.
The Courtâs Ruling
The Petition has no merit.
First Issue:
New Trial Not Warranted by
Simple Negligence of Counsel
Axiomatic is the rule that ânegligence of counsel binds the client.â
[8]
 The basis is the tenet that an act performed by counsel within the scope of a âgeneral or implied authorityâ
[9]
 is regarded as an act of the client.
[10]
 âConsequently, the mistake or negligence of counsel may result in the rendition of an unfavorable judgment against the client.â
[11]
While the application of this general rule certainly depends upon the surrounding circumstances of a given case,
[12]
 there are exceptions recognized by this Court: â(1) where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law;
[13]
 (2) when its application will result in outright deprivation of the clientâs liberty or property;
[14]
 or (3) where the interests of justice
[15]
 so require.â
[16]
  Woefully none of these exceptions apply herein.  Thus, the Court cannot âstep in and accord reliefâ
[17]
 to petitioner, even if it may have suffered
[18]
 by reason of its own arrant fatuity.
First
, as aptly determined by the appellate court, petitionerâs counsel is guilty of simple, not gross, negligence.  We cannot consider as gross negligence his resort to dilatory schemes, such as (1) the filing of at least three motions to extend the filing of petitionerâs Answer; (2) his nonappearance during the scheduled pretrials; and (3) the failure to file petitionerâs pretrial Brief, even after the filing of several Motions to extend the date for filing.
[19]
  There was only a plain âdisregard of some duty imposed by law,â
[20]
 a slight want of care that âcircumstances reasonably impose,â
[21]
 and a mere failure to exercise that degree of care
[22]
 that an ordinarily prudent person would take under the circumstances.  There was neither a total abandonment or disregard of petitionerâs case nor a showing of conscious indifference to or utter disregard of consequences.
[23]
Because âpre-trial is essential in the simplification and the speedy disposition of disputes,â
[24]
 nonobservance of its rules âmay result in prejudice to a partyâs substantive rights.â
[25]
 Such rules are ânot technicalities which the parties may ignore or trifle with.â
[26]
 The Rules of Court cannot be âignored at will and at random to the prejudice of the orderly presentation and assessment of the issues and their just resolution.â
[27]
Counselâs patent carelessness in citing conflicting reasons in his Motions for Reconsideration verily displays his lack of competence,
[28]
 diligence
[29]
 and candor,
[30]
 but not his recklessness or total want of care.
Indeed, the lawyerâs failure to live up to the dictates of the canons of the legal profession makes him answerable to both his profession and his employer.
[31]
Second
, the negligence of petitioner and that of its counsel are concurrent.
[32]
  As an artificial being whose juridical personality is created by fiction of law,
[33]
 petitioner âcan only exercise its powers and transact its business through the instrumentalities of its board of directors, and through its officers and agents, when authorized by resolution or its by-laws.â
[34]
 Atty. Manalo is an employee, not an outsider hired by petitioner on a retainer basis.  In fact, he is the officer-in-charge of its Legal Department.
There is no showing that he was not authorized to exercise the powers of the corporation or to transact its business, particularly the handling of its legal affairs.  Besides, it is presumed that the ordinary course of business has been followed.
[35]
 Therefore, counselâs corporate acts are supposed to be known and assented to by petitioner.
For petitioner to feign and repeatedly insist upon a lack of awareness of the progress of an important litigation is to unmask a penchant for the ludicrous.  Although it expects counsel to amply protect its interest, it cannot just sit back, relax and await the outcome of its case.
[36]
 In keeping with the normal course of events, it should have taken the initiative âof making the proper inquiries from its counsel and the trial court as to the status of its caseâ
[37]
 and of extending to him the ânecessary assistance.â
[38]
 For its failure to do so, it has only itself to blame.  Indeed, from lethargy is misfortune born.
It is of no consequence that its Human Resources and Personnel Departments were not aware of the progress of its case.  Of judicial notice is the fact that a corporation has much leeway in determining which of its units, singly or in consonance with others, is responsible for specific functions.  Yet, it is unusual that these departments were tasked with monitoring the progress of legal matters involving petitioner.  Nonetheless, having assigned these matters to them, it should have undertaken prompt and proper monitoring and reporting thereof.  Again, for its failure to do so, it has only itself to blame.  These departments do get involved in finance and accounting, especially in budget preparation and payroll computation, but billing and collection are hardly tangential to their concerns.
Third
, there was no denial of due process
[39]
 to petitioner.  Under the Rules of Court, an aggrieved party may ask for a new trial on the ground of excusable negligence,
[40]
 but this was not proved in this case.
[41]
 âNegligence, to be âexcusable,â must be one which ordinary diligence and prudence could not have guarded againstâ
[42]
 and by reason of which the rights of an aggrieved party have probably been impaired.
[43]
The test of excusable negligence is whether a party has acted âwith ordinary prudence while x x x transacting important business.â
[44]
 The reasons raised by petitioner in urging for a new trial do not meet this test; they are flimsy.  As we mentioned nearly thirty years ago, â[p]arties and counsel would be well advised to avoid such attempts to befuddle the issues as invariably they will be exposed for what they are, certainly unethical and degrading to the dignity of the law profession.â
[45]
âThe essence of due process is to be found in the reasonable opportunity to be heard and submit any evidence one may have in support of oneâs defense.â
[46]
 Where the opportunity to be heard, either through verbal arguments or pleadings, is accorded, and the party can âpresent its sideâ
[47]
 or defend its âinterest in due course,â
[48]
 âthere is no denial of procedural due process.â
[49]
 Petitioner has been given its chance, and after being declared in default, judgment has not been automatically ârendered in favor of the non-defaulting party.â
[50]
 Rather, judgment was made only after carefully weighing the evidence presented.  Substantive and adjective laws do complement each other
[51]
 âin the just and speedy resolution of the dispute between the parties.â
[52]
Petitioner was not deprived of its day in court.  Actually, it never even complained against the manner in which its counsel had handled the case,
[53]
 until late in the day.  It must therefore âbear the consequencesâ
[54]
 of its faulty choice of counsel whom it hired itself and whom it had âfull authority to fire at any time and replace with another.â
[55]
 Moreover, in all the pertinent cases cited by petitioner, the denial of due process was attributable to the gross negligence of retained counsels, who had either been single practitioners or law firms; none had referred to counsels who, like Atty. Manalo, were employees of the aggrieved party.
Fourth
, the negligence of petitionerâs counsel did not result in the outright deprivation of its property.  In fact, it intractably refused to comply with its obligation to reimburse respondent, after having already generated profits from operating the ferried unit.  When sued, it simply relied upon its own dillydallying counsel without even monitoring the progress of his work.  Now it tries to pass the buck entirely to him, after he has been relieved and replaced by another.  Throughout the course of litigation, none of its assets was reduced; on the contrary, its fleet of aircraft even increased.  While it has incurred legal expenses, it has also earned interest on money that should have been reimbursed to respondent.
Fifth
, the interests of justice require that positive law be equally observed.  Petitioner has not sufficiently proved the injustice of holding it liable for the negligence of its counsel.  On the contrary, there is a preponderance of evidence
[56]
 to demonstrate that both law and justice demand otherwise.  Much leniency has already been shown by the lower court to petitioner, but â
aequetas nunquam contravenit legis
.â
[57]
 Equity never contravenes the law.
[58]
For these reasons, the rendition of an unfavorable judgment against petitioner by reason of its counselâs simple negligence is therefore apropos.  To hold otherwise and grant a new trial will never put an end to any litigation,
[59]
 âas there is a new counsel to be hired every time it is shown that the prior one had not been sufficiently diligent, experienced or learned.â
[60]
Second Issue:
Monetary Awards Sufficiently Established
by a Preponderance of Evidence
 
 As correctly put by the appellate court, the Receipt/Agreement executed by the parties validated the inter-office Memorandum that petitioner issued on July 29, 1997, and the set of Billings it had received from respondent in 1996.
Liability per Receipt/Agreement
and Interest Thereon
 
 
First
, the Receipt/Agreement was entered into by respondent and petitioner, which was represented by its agent Atty. Manalo.  As an agent, he rendered service to, and did something in representation
[61]
 or on behalf of, his principal
[62]
 and with its consent
[63]
 and authority.  It cannot be denied that, on its part, there was an actual intent to appoint its counsel;
[64]
 and, on the latterâs part,
[65]
 to accept the appointment and âact on it.â
[66]
A corporation, as âa juridical person separate and distinct from its stockholders,â
[67]
 may act âthrough its officers or agents in the normal course of business.â
[68]
 Thus, the general principles of agency govern its relationship with its officers or agents, subject to the articles of incorporation, bylaws and other relevant provisions of law.
[69]
Second
, even assuming that Atty. Manalo exceeded his authority, petitioner is solidarily liable with him if it allowed him âto act as though he had full powers.â
[70]
 Moreover, as for any obligation wherein the agent has exceeded his power, the principal is not bound except when there is ratification,
[71]
 express or tacit.
[72]
Estoppel likewise applies.  For one, respondent lacked âknowledge and x x x the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in questionâ;
[73]
 namely, whether petitionerâs counsel had any authority to bind his principal.  Moreover, respondent relied âin good faithâ
[74]
 upon petitionerâs conduct and statements; and its action âbased thereon [was] of such character as to change the position or status of the party claiming the estoppel, to his injury, detriment or prejudice.â
[75]
 If it was also true that petitionerâs counsel exceeded his authority in entering into the Receipt/Agreement, the negligence or omission of petitioner to assert its right within a reasonable time only warranted a presumption that it either abandoned or declined to assert it.
[76]
Third
, while it is true that a special power of attorney (SPA) is necessary to a compromise, it is equally true that the herein Receipt/Agreement was not a compromise.
[77]
 The payment was made in the ordinary course of business.  Whether total or partial, the payment of an ordinary obligation
[78]
 is neither included among nor of a character similar to the instances enumerated in Article 1878 of the Civil Code.
[79]
 All that the law requires is a general power,
[80]
 not an SPA.
Moreover, the Receipt/Agreement is not a promise to pay that âamounts to an offer to compromise and requires a special power of attorney or the express consent of petitioner.â
[81]
 A compromise agreement is âa contract whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or put an end to one already commenced.â
[82]
 No such reciprocal concessions
[83]
 were made in this case.  Thus, the Receipt/Agreement is but an outright admission of petitioner of its obligation, after making partial payment, to pay the balance of its account.  And even if we were to consider the same as a compromise, from its nature as a contract, the absence of an SPA does not render it void, but merely unenforceable.
[84]
Fourth
, in its Answer,
[85]
 petitioner failed to deny under oath the genuineness and due execution of the Receipt/Agreement, which is thus deemed admitted.
[86]
 Indeed, before a private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved.  However, after it has been offered, failure to deny it under oath
[87]
 amounts to its admissibility.
[88]
 The âparty whose signature it bears admits that he signed it or that it was signed by another for him with his authority;
[89]
 that at the time it was signed it was in words and figures exactly as set out in the pleading of the party relying upon it; that the document was delivered; and that any formal requisites required by law, x x x which it lacks, are waived by him.â
[90]
 The Receipt/Agreement is thus an instrument that is admittedly not âspurious, counterfeit or of different import on its face from the one executed.â
[91]
Fifth
, what respondent has paid, it may demand from petitioner; and even if the payment was made without the knowledge or against the will of the latter, respondent can still recover insofar as such payment was beneficial to petitioner.
[92]
 Such payment cannot be considered as one that is neither due under the provisions of 
solutio indebiti
[93]
 nor recoverable from the creditor by respondent;
[94]
 the latterâs right is against petitioner whose obligation it has paid in advance.
[95]
Sixth
, the Memorandum and the Billings have probative value.  While it is true that Nazareno
[96]
 did not have any personal knowledge of the contents thereof, nevertheless, these two documents were validated by the Receipt/Agreement.  Petitionerâs Memorandum contained a recommendation to pay respondent the amount of US$27,730.60 and to require additional documentation in support of the balance.  In compliance, a Summary of Statement of Account dated January 6, 1998
[97]
 was sent to and received by petitioner, substantiating it to the extent of US$37,400.95.  Not only did these amounts sum up to a total of US$65,131.55, the unsettled account indicated in the Billings, but these are also unrefuted by petitioner.  In fact, the Receipt/Agreement executed two months later did not contest this balance, although unvalued therein.  When a party fails to object to hearsay evidence,
[98]
 such party is deemed to have waived its right to do so; thus, âthe evidence offered may be admitted,â
[99]
 though its weight must still be measured by the court.
Seventh
, the accounting required by petitioner was not a legal impediment to the obligation.  There was in fact no indication that the obligation was subject to such a condition.  A pure obligation is demandable at once,
[100]
 and there is nothing  to  exempt petitioner from compliance therewith.
[101]
 In addition, it would be preposterous for it to issue a corporate check
[102]
 -- without any condition or reservation -- and even waive a demand for payment of the balance, if it did not recognize its obligation in the first place.
Eighth
, the obligation consisted in the payment of a sum of money, and petitioner incurred in delay; hence, there being no stipulation to the contrary, the indemnity for damages shall be the payment of legal interest, which is six percent (6%) per annum.
[103]
 Such interest may be allowed upon damages awarded for a clear breach of contract.
[104]
Commission or Brokerâs Fee
Indeed, âonly questions of law
[105]
 may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.â
[106]
 Questions of fact cannot be the subject of this mode of appeal,
[107]
 for this Court --we have repeatedly emphasized -- is ânot a trier of facts.â
[108]
 One of the exceptions to this rule, however, is when the factual findings of the CA and the trial court are contradictory.
[109]
The lower court held petitioner liable for the 10 percent brokerâs fee, but the appellate court found otherwise.  It is true that respondent -- on commission basis -- engaged itself as a broker to negotiate âcontracts relative to property,â
[110]
 the custody of which it had no concern over; to never act âin its own name but in the name of those who employedâ
[111]
 it; and âto bring parties together x x x in matters of trade, commerce or navigation.â
[112]
 However, we agree with the CA that respondentâs entitlement to a brokerâs fee should have been adequately proven.
The March 19, 1997 Certification issued by Captain Villacampa is inadmissible in evidence.  It was a mere reproduction of an original that had never been produced or offered in evidence.
[113]
  Under the best evidence rule
[114]
 as applied to documentary evidence, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original itself when the subject of inquiry is its contents.
[115]
 Since none of the exceptions to this rule has been proven,
[116]
 âsecondary or substitutionary evidenceâ
[117]
 is not permitted.
[118]
It is of no moment that Nazareno testified as to the intermediaryâs commission in open court.  Whether the Certification has actually been executed cannot be proved by his mere testimony, because he was not a signatory to the document.  His assertion was bare and untested.  Without substantiation, âsuch testimony is considered hearsay.â
[119]
 Witnesses can testify only to those facts that they know of their personal knowledge or are derived from their own perception.
[120]
 Unlike the unvalued balance in the Receipt/Agreement, the brokerâs fee herein has not been supported by any admissible evidence other than the demand letters sent by respondentâs counsel.
Attorneyâs Fees
Attorneyâs fees may be recovered, since petitioner has compelled respondent to incur expenses to protect the latterâs interest
[121]
 in reimbursement.  Besides, it is clear from the Receipt/Agreement that petitioner is obliged to pay 10 percent of the principal, as attorneyâs fees.
In sum, petitioner is liable for the unpaid balance of respondentâs claim amounting to US$59,798.22 or its equivalent in legal tender under the Receipt/Agreement, including legal interest from May 12, 1997 until fully paid; and for attorneyâs fees of 10 percent of this unpaid balance, excluding interest.  No brokerâs fee can be charged, as it has not been proven by respondent.  Since the counsel of petitioner is guilty of simple negligence only, and since it was equally negligent as he, no new trial can be allowed.

(6) when the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts;
(7) when the Court of Appeals fails to notice certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, will justify a different conclusion;
(8) when the findings of fact are themselves conflicting;
(9) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of the specific evidence on which they are based; and
(10) when the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence but such findings are contradicted by the evidence on record.â
