ANG LADLAD LGBT PARTY REPRESENTED HEREIN BY ITS CHAIR, DANTON REMOTO, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




DEL CASTILLO, J.:


... [F]reedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order.
Justice Robert A. Jackson
West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette
[1]
One unavoidable consequence of everyone having the freedom to choose is that others may make different choices - choices we would not make for ourselves, choices we may disapprove of, even choices that may shock or offend or anger us. However, choices are not to be legally prohibited merely because they are different, and the right to disagree and debate about important questions of public policy is a core value protected by our Bill of Rights.  Indeed, our democracy is built on genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and difference in opinion.
Since ancient times, society has grappled with deep disagreements about the definitions and demands of morality.  In many cases, where moral convictions are concerned, harmony among those theoretically opposed is an insurmountable goal. Yet herein lies the paradox - philosophical justifications about what is moral are indispensable and yet at the same time powerless to create agreement.  This Court recognizes, however, that practical solutions are preferable to ideological stalemates; accommodation is better than intransigence; reason more worthy than rhetoric. This will allow persons of diverse viewpoints to live together, if not harmoniously, then, at least, civilly.
Factual Background
This is a Petition for 
Certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, with an application for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, filed by 
Ang Ladlad
 LGBT Party (
Ang Ladlad
) against the Resolutions of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dated November 11, 2009
[2]
 (the First Assailed Resolution) and December 16, 2009
[3]
 (the Second Assailed Resolution) in SPP No. 09-228 (PL) (collectively, the Assailed Resolutions). The case has its roots in the COMELEC's refusal to accredit 
Ang Ladlad
 as a party-list organization under Republic Act (RA) No. 7941, otherwise known as the Party-List System Act.
[4]
Ang Ladlad
 is an organization composed of men and women who identify themselves as lesbians, gays, bisexuals, or trans-gendered individuals (LGBTs). Incorporated in 2003, 
Ang Ladlad
 first applied for registration with the COMELEC in 2006.  The application for accreditation was denied on the ground that the organization had no substantial membership base. On August 17, 2009, 
Ang Ladlad
 again filed a Petition
[5]
 for registration with the COMELEC.
Before the COMELEC, petitioner argued that the LGBT community is a marginalized and under-represented sector that is particularly disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation and gender identity; that LGBTs are victims of exclusion, discrimination, and violence; that because of negative societal attitudes, LGBTs are constrained to hide their sexual orientation; and that 
Ang Ladlad
 complied with the 8-point guidelines enunciated by this Court in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections
.
[6]
 
Ang Ladlad
 laid out its national membership base consisting of individual members and organizational supporters, and outlined its platform of governance.
[7]
On November 11, 2009, after admitting the petitioner's evidence, the COMELEC (Second Division) dismissed the Petition on moral grounds, stating that:
x x x This Petition is dismissible on moral grounds. Petitioner defines the Filipino Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Community, thus:
x x x a marginalized and under-represented sector that is particularly disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.
and proceeded to define sexual orientation as that which:
x x x refers to a person's capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender, of the same gender, or more than one gender."
This definition of the LGBT sector makes it crystal clear that petitioner tolerates immorality which offends religious beliefs. In Romans 1:26, 27, Paul wrote:
For this cause God gave them up into vile affections, for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.
In the Koran, the hereunder verses are pertinent:
For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women "ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds." (7.81) "And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!" (7:84) "He said: "O my Lord! Help Thou me against people who do mischief" (29:30).
As correctly pointed out by the Law Department in its Comment dated October 2, 2008:
The ANG LADLAD apparently advocates sexual immorality as indicated in the Petition's par. 6F: `Consensual partnerships or relationships by gays and lesbians who are already of age'. It is further indicated in par. 24 of the Petition which waves for the record: `In 2007, 
Men Having Sex with Men
 or MSMs in the Philippines were estimated as 670,000 (Genesis 19 is the history of Sodom and Gomorrah).
Laws are deemed incorporated in every contract, permit, license, relationship, or accreditation. Hence, pertinent provisions of the Civil Code and the Revised Penal Code are deemed part of the requirement to be complied with for accreditation.
ANG LADLAD collides with Article 695 of the Civil Code which defines nuisance as `Any act, omission, establishment, business, condition of property, or anything else which x x x (3) shocks, defies; or disregards 
decency or morality
 x x x
It also collides with Article 1306 of the Civil Code: `The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, 
morals, good customs
, public order or public policy. Art 1409 of the Civil Code provides that `Contracts whose cause, object or purpose is contrary to law, 
morals, good customs
, public order or public policy' are inexistent and void from the beginning.
Finally to safeguard the morality of the Filipino community, the Revised Penal Code, as amended, penalizes `Immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions and indecent shows' as follows:
Art. 201.Immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions, and indecent shows. â The penalty of prision mayor or a fine ranging from six thousand to twelve thousand pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine, shall be imposed upon:
1.Those who shall publicly expound or proclaim doctrines openly 
contrary to public morals
;
2. (a) The authors of obscene literature, published with their knowledge in any form; the editors publishing such literature; and the owners/operators of the establishment selling the same;
(b) Those who, in theaters, fairs, cinematographs or any other place, exhibit indecent or immoral plays, scenes, acts or shows, it being understood that the obscene literature or indecent or immoral plays, scenes, acts or shows, whether live or in film, which are prescribed by virtue hereof, shall include those which: (1) glorify criminals or condone crimes; (2) serve no other purpose but to satisfy the market for violence, 
lust or pornography
; (3) offend any race or religion; (4) tend to abet traffic in and use of prohibited drugs; and (5) are contrary to law, public order, 
morals, good customs
, established policies, lawful orders, decrees and edicts.
3. Those who shall sell, give away or exhibit films, prints, engravings, sculpture or literature which are offensive to morals.
Petitioner should likewise be denied accreditation not only for advocating immoral doctrines but likewise for not being truthful when it said that it "
or any of its nominees/party-list representatives have not violated or failed to comply with laws, rules, or regulations relating to the elections
."
Furthermore, should this Commission grant the petition, we will be exposing our youth to an environment that does not conform to the teachings of our faith. Lehman Strauss, a famous bible teacher and writer in the U.S.A. said in one article that "
older practicing homosexuals are a threat to the youth.
" As an agency of the government, ours too is the State's avowed duty under Section 13, Article II of the Constitution to protect our youth from moral and spiritual degradation.
[8]
When 
Ang Ladlad
 sought reconsideration,
[9]
 three commissioners voted to overturn the First Assailed Resolution (Commissioners Gregorio Y. Larrazabal, Rene V. Sarmiento, and Armando Velasco), while three commissioners voted to deny 
Ang Ladlad's
 Motion for Reconsideration
 
(Commissioners Nicodemo T. Ferrer, Lucenito N. Tagle, and Elias R. Yusoph). The COMELEC Chairman, breaking the tie and speaking for the majority in his Separate Opinion, upheld the First Assailed Resolution, stating that:
I. The Spirit of Republic Act No. 7941
Ladlad 
is applying for accreditation as a sectoral party in the party-list system. Even assuming that it has properly proven its under-representation and marginalization, it cannot be said that 
Ladlad
's expressed sexual orientations 
per se 
would benefit the nation as a whole.
Section 2 of the party-list law unequivocally states that the purpose of the party-list system of electing congressional representatives is to enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and under-represented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives.
If entry into the party-list system would depend only on the ability of an organization to represent its constituencies, then all representative organizations would have found themselves into the party-list race. But that is not the intention of the framers of the law. The party-list system is not a tool to advocate tolerance and acceptance of misunderstood persons or groups of persons. Rather, 
the party-list system is a tool for the realization of aspirations of marginalized individuals 
whose interests are also the nation's
 
- only that their interests have not been brought to the attention of the nation because of their under representation. 
Until the time comes when 
Ladlad 
is able to justify that having mixed sexual orientations and transgender identities is beneficial to the nation, its application for accreditation under the party-list system will remain just that.
II. No substantial differentiation
In the United States, whose equal protection doctrine pervades Philippine jurisprudence, courts do not recognize lesbians, gays, homosexuals, and bisexuals (LGBT) as a "special class" of individuals.  x x x  Significantly, it has also been held that homosexuality is not a constitutionally protected fundamental right, and that "nothing in the U.S. Constitution discloses a comparable intent to protect or promote the social or legal equality of homosexual relations," as in the case of race or religion or belief.
x x x x
Thus, even if society's understanding, tolerance, and acceptance of LGBT's is elevated, there can be no denying that 
Ladlad
 constituencies are still males and females, and 
they will remain either male or female protected by the same Bill of Rights that applies to all citizens alike
.
x x x x
IV.  Public Morals
x x x There is no question about not imposing on 
Ladlad
 Christian or Muslim religious practices. Neither is there any attempt to any particular religious group's moral rules on 
Ladlad
. Rather, what are being adopted as moral parameters and precepts are generally accepted public morals. They are possibly religious-based, but 
as a society, the Philippines cannot ignore its more than 500 years of Muslim and Christian upbringing, such that some moral precepts espoused by said religions have sipped [sic] into society and these are not publicly accepted moral norms
.
V. Legal Provisions
But above morality and social norms, they have become part of the law of the land. Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code imposes the penalty of 
prision mayor 
upon "Those who shall publicly expound or proclaim doctrines openly contrary to public morals." It penalizes "immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibition and indecent shows." 
"Ang Ladlad" 
apparently falls under these legal provisions. This is clear from its Petition's paragraph 6F: "Consensual partnerships or relationships by gays and lesbians who are already of age' It is further indicated in par. 24 of the Petition which waves for the record: `In 2007, 
Men Having Sex with Men
 or MSMs in the Philippines were estimated as 670,000. Moreoever, Article 694 of the Civil Code defines "nuisance" as any act, omission x x x or anything else x x x which shocks, defies or disregards decency or morality x x x." These are all unlawful.
[10]
On January 4, 2010, 
Ang Ladlad
 filed this Petition, praying that the Court annul the Assailed Resolutions and direct the COMELEC to grant 
Ang Ladlad's
 application for accreditation.  
Ang Ladlad
 also sought the issuance 
ex parte 
of a preliminary mandatory injunction against the COMELEC, which had previously announced that it would begin printing the final ballots for the May 2010 elections by January 25, 2010.
On January 6, 2010, we ordered the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to file its Comment on behalf of COMELEC not later than 12:00 noon of January 11, 2010.
[11]
  Instead of filing a Comment, however, the OSG filed a Motion for Extension, requesting that it be given until January 16, 2010 to Comment.
[12]
  Somewhat surprisingly, the OSG later filed a Comment in support of petitioner's application.
[13]
  Thus, in order to give COMELEC the opportunity to fully ventilate its position, we required it to file its own comment.
[14]
 The COMELEC, through its Law Department, filed its Comment on February 2, 2010.
[15]
In the meantime, due to the urgency of the petition, we issued a temporary restraining order on January 12, 2010, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, directing the COMELEC to cease and desist from implementing the Assailed Resolutions.
[16]
Also, on January 13, 2010, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) filed a Motion to Intervene or to Appear as Amicus Curiae, attaching thereto its Comment-in-Intervention.
[17]
  The CHR opined that the denial of 
Ang Ladlad's
 petition on moral grounds violated the standards and principles of the Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  On January 19, 2010, we granted the CHR's motion to intervene.
On January 26, 2010, Epifanio D. Salonga, Jr. filed his Motion to Intervene
[18]
 which motion was granted on February 2, 2010.
[19]
The Parties' Arguments
Ang Ladlad
 argued that the denial of accreditation, insofar as it justified the exclusion by using religious dogma, violated the constitutional guarantees against the establishment of religion.  Petitioner also claimed that the Assailed Resolutions contravened its constitutional rights to privacy, freedom of speech and assembly, and equal protection of laws, as well as constituted violations of the Philippines' international obligations against discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The OSG concurred with 
Ang Ladlad's
 petition and argued that the COMELEC erred in denying petitioner's application for registration since there was no basis for COMELEC's allegations of immorality. It also opined that LGBTs have their own special interests and concerns which should have been recognized by the COMELEC as a separate classification.  However, insofar as the purported violations of petitioner's freedom of speech, expression, and assembly were concerned, the OSG maintained that there had been no restrictions on these rights.
In its Comment, the COMELEC reiterated that petitioner does not have a concrete and genuine national political agenda to benefit the nation and that the petition was validly dismissed on moral grounds. It also argued 
for the first time
 
that the LGBT sector is not among the sectors enumerated by the Constitution and RA 7941, and that petitioner made untruthful statements in its petition when it alleged its national existence contrary to actual verification reports by COMELEC's field personnel.
Our Ruling
We grant the petition.
Compliance with the Requirements of 
the Constitution and Republic Act No.
  7941
The COMELEC denied 
Ang Ladlad's
 application for registration on the ground that the LGBT sector is neither enumerated in the Constitution and RA 7941, nor is it associated with or related to any of the sectors in the enumeration.
Respondent mistakenly opines that our ruling in 
Ang Bagong Bayani 
stands for the proposition that only those sectors specifically enumerated in the law or related to said sectors (labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals) may be registered under the party-list system. As we explicitly ruled in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections
,
[20]
 "the enumeration of marginalized and under-represented sectors is not exclusive".  The crucial element is not whether a sector is specifically enumerated, but whether a particular organization complies with the requirements of the Constitution and RA 7941.
Respondent also argues that 
Ang Ladlad
 made untruthful statements in its petition when it alleged that it had nationwide existence through its members and affiliate organizations. The COMELEC claims that upon verification by its field personnel, it was shown that "save for a few isolated places in the country, petitioner does not exist in almost all provinces in the country."
[21]
This argument that "petitioner made untruthful statements in its petition when it alleged its national existence" is a new one; previously, the COMELEC claimed that petitioner was "not being truthful when it said that it or any of its nominees/party-list representatives have not violated or failed to comply with laws, rules, or regulations relating to the elections."  Nowhere was this ground for denial of petitioner's accreditation mentioned or even alluded to in the Assailed Resolutions. This, in itself, is quite curious, considering that the reports of petitioner's alleged non-existence were already available to the COMELEC prior to the issuance of the First Assailed Resolution. At best, this is irregular procedure; at worst, a belated afterthought, a change in respondent's theory, and a serious violation of petitioner's right to procedural due process.
Nonetheless, we find that there has been no misrepresentation.  A cursory perusal of 
Ang Ladlad's
 initial petition shows that it never claimed to exist in each province of the Philippines. Rather, petitioner alleged that the LGBT community in the Philippines was estimated to constitute at least 670,000 persons; that it had 16,100 affiliates and members around the country, and 4,044 members in its electronic discussion group.
[22]
 
Ang Ladlad
 also represented itself to be "a national LGBT umbrella organization with affiliates around the Philippines composed of the following LGBT networks:"
Abra Gay Association
Aklan Butterfly Brigade (ABB) - Aklan
Albay Gay Association
Arts Center of Cabanatuan City - Nueva Ecija
Boys Legion - Metro Manila
Cagayan de Oro People Like Us (CDO PLUS)
Can't Live in the Closet, Inc. (CLIC) - Metro Manila
Cebu Pride - Cebu City
Circle of Friends
Dipolog Gay Association - Zamboanga del Norte
Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Youth Association (GABAY)
Gay and Lesbian Activists Network for Gender Equality (GALANG) - Metro Manila
Gay Men's Support Group (GMSG) - Metro Manila
Gay United for Peace and Solidarity (GUPS) - Lanao del Norte
Iloilo City Gay Association - Iloilo City
Kabulig Writer's Group - Camarines Sur
Lesbian Advocates Philippines, Inc. (LEAP)
LUMINA - Baguio City
Marikina Gay Association - Metro Manila
Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) - Metro Manila
Naga City Gay Association - Naga City
ONE BACARDI
Order of St. Aelred (OSAe) - Metro Manila
PUP LAKAN
RADAR PRIDEWEAR
Rainbow Rights Project (R-Rights), Inc. - Metro Manila
San Jose del Monte Gay Association - Bulacan
Sining Kayumanggi Royal Family - Rizal
Society of Transexual Women of the Philippines (STRAP) - Metro Manila
Soul Jive - Antipolo, Rizal
The Link - Davao City
Tayabas Gay Association - Quezon
Women's Bisexual Network - Metro Manila
Zamboanga Gay Association - Zamboanga City
[23]
Since the COMELEC only searched for the names 
ANG LADLAD
 LGBT or 
LADLAD
 LGBT, it is no surprise that they found that petitioner had no presence in any of these regions. In fact, if COMELEC's findings are to be believed, petitioner does not even exist in Quezon City, which is registered as 
Ang Ladlad's
 principal place of business.
Against this backdrop, we find that 
Ang Ladlad
 has sufficiently demonstrated its compliance with the legal requirements for accreditation. Indeed, aside from COMELEC's moral objection and the belated allegation of non-existence, nowhere in the records has the respondent ever found/ruled that 
Ang Ladlad
 is not qualified to register as a party-list organization under any of the requisites under RA 7941 or the guidelines in 
Ang Bagong Bayani
.  The difference, COMELEC claims, lies in 
Ang Ladlad's
 morality, or lack thereof.
Religion as the Basis for Refusal to 
Accept Ang Ladlad's Petition for 
Registration
Our Constitution provides in Article III, Section 5 that "[n]o law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." At bottom, what our non-establishment clause calls for is "government neutrality in religious matters."
[24]
  Clearly, "governmental reliance on religious justification is inconsistent with this policy of neutrality."
[25]
  We thus find that it was grave violation of the non-establishment clause for the COMELEC to utilize the Bible and the Koran to justify the exclusion of 
Ang Ladlad
.
Rather than relying on religious belief, the legitimacy of the Assailed Resolutions should depend, instead, on whether the COMELEC is able to advance some justification for its rulings beyond mere conformity to religious doctrine. Otherwise stated, government must act for secular purposes and in ways that have primarily secular effects.  As we held in 
Estrada v. Escritor
:
[26]
x x x  The morality referred to in the law is public and necessarily secular, not religious as the dissent of Mr. Justice Carpio holds. "Religious teachings as expressed in public debate may influence the civil public order but public moral disputes may be resolved only on grounds articulable in secular terms." Otherwise, if government relies upon religious beliefs in formulating public policies and morals, the resulting policies and morals would require conformity to what some might regard as religious programs or agenda. The non-believers would therefore be compelled to conform to a standard of conduct buttressed by a religious belief, i.e., to a "compelled religion," anathema to religious freedom. Likewise, if government based its actions upon religious beliefs, it would tacitly approve or endorse that belief and thereby also tacitly disapprove contrary religious or non-religious views that would not support the policy. As a result, government will not provide full religious freedom for all its citizens, or even make it appear that those whose beliefs are disapproved are second-class citizens.
In other words, government action, including its proscription of immorality as expressed in criminal law like concubinage, must have a secular purpose. That is, the government proscribes this conduct because it is "detrimental (or dangerous) to those conditions upon which depend the existence and progress of human society" and not because the conduct is proscribed by the beliefs of one religion or the other. Although admittedly, moral judgments based on religion might have a compelling influence on those engaged in public deliberations over what actions would be considered a moral disapprobation punishable by law. After all, they might also be adherents of a religion and thus have religious opinions and moral codes with a compelling influence on them; the human mind endeavors to regulate the temporal and spiritual institutions of society in a uniform manner, harmonizing earth with heaven. Succinctly put, a law could be religious or Kantian or Aquinian or utilitarian in its deepest roots, but it must have an articulable and discernible secular purpose and justification to pass scrutiny of the religion clauses. x x x Recognizing the religious nature of the Filipinos and the elevating influence of religion in society, however, the Philippine constitution's religion clauses prescribe not a strict but a benevolent neutrality. Benevolent neutrality recognizes that government must pursue its secular goals and interests but at the same time strive to uphold religious liberty to the greatest extent possible within flexible constitutional limits. Thus, although the morality contemplated by laws is secular, benevolent neutrality could allow for accommodation of morality based on religion, provided it does not offend compelling state interests.
[27]
Public Morals as a Ground to
 Deny Ang Ladlad's Petition for
 Registration
Respondent suggests that although the moral condemnation of homosexuality and homosexual conduct may be religion-based, it has long been transplanted into generally accepted public morals.  The COMELEC argues:
Petitioner's accreditation was denied not necessarily because their group consists of LGBTs but because of the danger it poses to the people especially the youth. Once it is recognized by the government, a sector which believes that there is nothing wrong in having sexual relations with individuals of the same gender is a bad example. It will bring down the standard of morals we cherish in our civilized society. Any society without a set of moral precepts is in danger of losing its own existence.
[28]
We are not blind to the fact that, through the years, homosexual conduct, and perhaps homosexuals themselves, have borne the brunt of societal disapproval.  It is not difficult to imagine the reasons behind this censure - religious beliefs, convictions about the preservation of marriage, family, and procreation, even dislike or distrust of homosexuals themselves and their perceived lifestyle.  Nonetheless, we recall that the Philippines has not seen fit to criminalize homosexual conduct. Evidently, therefore, these "generally accepted public morals" have not been convincingly transplanted into the realm of law.
[29]
The Assailed Resolutions have not identified any specific overt immoral act performed by 
Ang Ladlad
.  Even the OSG agrees that "there should have been a finding by the COMELEC that the group's members have committed or are committing immoral acts."
[30]
  The OSG argues:
x x x A person may be sexually attracted to a person of the same gender, of a different gender, or more than one gender, but mere attraction does not translate to immoral acts. There is a great divide between thought and action. 
Reduction ad absurdum
. If immoral thoughts could be penalized, COMELEC would have its hands full of disqualification cases against both the "straights" and the gays." Certainly this is not the intendment of the law.
[31]
Respondent has failed to explain what societal ills are sought to be prevented, or why special protection is required for the youth. Neither has the COMELEC condescended to justify its position that petitioner's admission into the party-list system would be so harmful as to irreparably damage the moral fabric of society. We, of course, do not suggest that the state is wholly without authority to regulate matters concerning morality, sexuality, and sexual relations, and we recognize that the government will and should continue to restrict behavior considered detrimental to society. Nonetheless, we cannot countenance advocates who, undoubtedly with the loftiest of intentions, situate morality on one end of an argument or another, without bothering to go through the rigors of legal reasoning and explanation.  In this, the notion of morality is robbed of all value.  Clearly then, the bare invocation of morality will not remove an issue from our scrutiny.
We also find the COMELEC's reference to purported violations of our penal and civil laws flimsy, at best; disingenuous, at worst. Article 694 of the Civil Code defines a nuisance as "any act, omission, establishment, condition of property, or anything else which shocks, defies, or disregards decency or morality," the remedies for which are a prosecution under the Revised Penal Code or any local ordinance, a civil action, or abatement without judicial proceedings.
[32]
  A violation of Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code, on the other hand, requires proof beyond reasonable doubt to support a criminal conviction. It hardly needs to be emphasized that mere allegation of violation of laws is not proof, and a mere blanket invocation of public morals cannot replace the institution of civil or criminal proceedings and a judicial determination of liability or culpability.
As such, we hold that moral disapproval, without more, is not a sufficient governmental interest to justify exclusion of homosexuals from participation in the party-list system. The denial of 
Ang Ladlad's
 registration on purely moral grounds amounts more to a statement of dislike and disapproval of homosexuals, rather than a tool to further any substantial public interest.  Respondent's blanket justifications give rise to the inevitable conclusion that the COMELEC targets homosexuals themselves as a class, not because of any particular morally reprehensible act.  It is this selective targeting that implicates our equal protection clause.
Equal Protection
Despite the absolutism of Article III, Section 1 of our Constitution, which provides "
nor shall any person be denied equal protection of the laws
," courts have never interpreted the provision as an absolute prohibition on classification.
  "Equality," said Aristotle, "consists in the same treatment of similar persons."
[33]
  The equal protection clause guarantees that no person or class of persons shall be deprived of the same protection of laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and in like circumstances.
[34]
Recent jurisprudence has affirmed that if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the classification as long as it bears a rational relationship to some legitimate government end.
[35]
  In 
Central Bank Employees Association, Inc. v. Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas,
[36]
 we declared that "[i]n our jurisdiction, the standard of analysis of equal protection challenges x x x have followed the `rational basis' test, coupled with a deferential attitude to legislative classifications and a reluctance to invalidate a law unless there is a showing of a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution."
[37]
The COMELEC posits that the majority of the Philippine population considers homosexual conduct as immoral and unacceptable, and this constitutes sufficient reason to disqualify the petitioner. Unfortunately for the respondent, the Philippine electorate has expressed no such belief.  No law exists to criminalize homosexual behavior or expressions or parties about homosexual behavior.  Indeed, even if we were to assume that public opinion is as the COMELEC describes it, the asserted state interest here - that is, moral disapproval of an unpopular minority - is not a legitimate state interest that is sufficient to satisfy rational basis review under the equal protection clause.  The COMELEC's differentiation, and its unsubstantiated claim that 
Ang Ladlad
 cannot contribute to the formulation of legislation that would benefit the nation, furthers no legitimate state interest other than disapproval of or dislike for a disfavored group.
From the standpoint of the political process, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender have the same interest in participating in the party-list system on the same basis as other political parties similarly situated.  State intrusion in this case is equally burdensome. Hence, laws of general application should apply with equal force to LGBTs, and they deserve to participate in the party-list system on the same basis as other marginalized and under-represented sectors.
It bears stressing that our finding that COMELEC's act of differentiating LGBTs from heterosexuals insofar as the party-list system is concerned does not imply that any other law distinguishing between heterosexuals and homosexuals under different circumstances would similarly fail. We disagree with the OSG's position that homosexuals are a class in themselves for the purposes of the equal protection clause.
[38]
  We are not prepared to single out homosexuals as a separate class meriting special or differentiated treatment.  We have not received sufficient evidence to this effect, and it is simply unnecessary to make such a ruling today. Petitioner itself has merely demanded that it be recognized under the same basis as all other groups similarly situated, and that the COMELEC made "an unwarranted and impermissible classification not justified by the circumstances of the case."
Freedom of Expression and Association
Under our system of laws, every group has the right to promote its agenda and attempt to persuade society of the validity of its position through normal democratic means.
[39]
  It is in the public square that deeply held convictions and differing opinions should be distilled and deliberated upon.  As we held in 
Estrada v. Escritor:

In a democracy, this common agreement on political and moral ideas is distilled in the public square. Where citizens are free, every opinion, every prejudice, every aspiration, and every moral discernment has access to the public square where people deliberate the order of their life together. Citizens are the bearers of opinion, including opinion shaped by, or espousing religious belief, and these citizens have equal access to the public square. In this representative democracy, the state is prohibited from determining which convictions and moral judgments may be proposed for public deliberation. Through a constitutionally designed process, the people deliberate and decide. Majority rule is a necessary principle in this democratic governance. Thus, when public deliberation on moral judgments is finally crystallized into law, the laws will largely reflect the beliefs and preferences of the majority, i.e., the mainstream or median groups. Nevertheless, in the very act of adopting and accepting a constitution and the limits it specifies - including protection of religious freedom "not only for a minority, however small - not only for a majority, however large - but for each of us" - the majority imposes upon itself a self-denying ordinance. It promises not to do what it otherwise could do: to ride roughshod over the dissenting minorities.
Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, and this freedom applies not only to those that are favorably received but also to those that offend, shock, or disturb. Any restriction imposed in this sphere must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Absent any compelling state interest, it is not for the COMELEC or this Court to impose its views on the populace. Otherwise stated, the COMELEC is certainly not free to interfere with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message or discouraging a disfavored one.
This position gains even more force if one considers that homosexual conduct is not illegal in this country. It follows that both expressions concerning one's homosexuality and the activity of forming a political association that supports LGBT individuals are protected as well.
Other jurisdictions have gone so far as to categorically rule that even overwhelming public perception that homosexual conduct violates public morality does not justify criminalizing same-sex conduct.
[41]
  European and United Nations judicial decisions have ruled in favor of gay rights claimants on both privacy and equality grounds, citing general privacy and equal protection provisions in foreign and international texts.
[42]
 To the extent that there is much to learn from other jurisdictions that have reflected on the issues we face here, such jurisprudence is certainly illuminating. These foreign authorities, while not formally binding on Philippine courts, may nevertheless have persuasive influence on the Court's analysis.
In the area of freedom of expression, for instance, United States courts have ruled that existing free speech doctrines protect gay and lesbian rights to expressive conduct. In order to justify the prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, public institutions must show that their actions were caused by "something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint."
[43]
With respect to freedom of association for the advancement of ideas and beliefs, in Europe, with its vibrant human rights tradition, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has repeatedly stated that a political party may campaign for a change in the law or the constitutional structures of a state if it uses legal and democratic means and the changes it proposes are consistent with democratic principles. The ECHR has emphasized that political ideas that challenge the existing order and whose realization is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of association, even if such ideas may seem shocking or unacceptable to the authorities or the majority of the population.
[44]
 A political group should not be hindered solely because it seeks to publicly debate controversial political issues in order to find solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned.
[45]
 Only if a political party incites violence or puts forward policies that are incompatible with democracy does it fall outside the protection of the freedom of association guarantee.
[46]
We do not doubt that a number of our citizens may believe that homosexual conduct is distasteful, offensive, or even defiant. They are entitled to hold and express that view.  On the other hand, LGBTs and their supporters, in all likelihood, believe with equal fervor that relationships between individuals of the same sex are morally equivalent to heterosexual relationships. They, too, are entitled to hold and express that view.  However, as far as this Court is concerned, our democracy precludes using the religious or moral views of one part of the community to exclude from consideration the values of other members of the community.
Of course, none of this suggests the impending arrival of a golden age for gay rights litigants.  It well may be that this Decision will only serve to highlight the discrepancy between the rigid constitutional analysis of this Court and the more complex moral sentiments of Filipinos. We do not suggest that public opinion, even at its most liberal, reflect a clear-cut strong consensus favorable to gay rights claims and we neither attempt nor expect to affect individual perceptions of homosexuality through this Decision.
The OSG argues that since there has been neither prior restraint nor subsequent punishment imposed on 
Ang Ladlad
, and its members have not been deprived of their right to voluntarily associate, then there has been no restriction on their freedom of expression or association. The OSG argues that:
There was no utterance restricted, no publication censored, or any assembly denied. [COMELEC] simply exercised its authority to review and verify the qualifications of petitioner as a sectoral party applying to participate in the party-list system. This lawful exercise of duty cannot be said to be a transgression of Section 4, Article III of the Constitution.
x x x x
A denial of the petition for registration x x x does not deprive the members of the petitioner to freely take part in the conduct of elections. Their right to vote will not be hampered by said denial. In fact, the right to vote is a constitutionally-guaranteed right which cannot be limited.
As to its right to be elected in a genuine periodic election, petitioner contends that the denial of Ang Ladlad's petition has the clear and immediate effect of limiting, if not outrightly nullifying the capacity of its members to fully and equally participate in public life through engagement in the party list elections.
This argument is puerile. The holding of a public office is not a right but a privilege subject to limitations imposed by law. x x x
[47]
The OSG fails to recall that petitioner has, in fact, established its qualifications to participate in the party-list system, and - as advanced by the OSG itself - the moral objection offered by the COMELEC was not a limitation imposed by law.  To the extent, therefore, that the petitioner has been precluded, because of COMELEC's action, from publicly expressing its views as a political party and participating on an equal basis in the political process with other equally-qualified party-list candidates, we find that there has, indeed, been a transgression of petitioner's fundamental rights.
Non-Discrimination and International Law
In an age that has seen international law evolve geometrically in scope and promise, international human rights law, in particular, has grown dynamically in its attempt to bring about a more just and humane world order. For individuals and groups struggling with inadequate structural and governmental support, international human rights norms are particularly significant, and should be effectively enforced in domestic legal systems so that such norms may become actual, rather than ideal, standards of conduct.
Our Decision today is fully in accord with our international obligations to protect and promote human rights. In particular, we explicitly recognize the principle of non-discrimination as it relates to the right to electoral participation, enunciated in the UDHR and the ICCPR.
The principle of non-discrimination is laid out in Article 26 of the ICCPR, as follows:
 Article 26
All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
In this context, the principle of non-discrimination requires that laws of general application relating to elections be applied equally to all persons, regardless of sexual orientation. Although sexual orientation is not specifically enumerated as a status or ratio for discrimination in Article 26 of the ICCPR, the ICCPR Human Rights Committee has opined that the reference to "sex" in Article 26 should be construed to include "sexual orientation."
[48]
  Additionally, a variety of United Nations bodies have declared discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation to be prohibited under various international agreements.
[49]
The UDHR provides:
Article 21.
(1)   Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
Likewise, the ICCPR states:
Article 25
Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:
(a)   To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;
(b)   To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;
(c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.
As stated by the CHR in its Comment-in-Intervention
, 
the scope of the right to electoral participation is elaborated by the Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No. 25 (Participation in Public Affairs and the Right to Vote) as follows:
1. Article 25 of the Covenant recognizes and protects the right of every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, the right to vote and to be elected and the right to have access to public service. Whatever form of constitution or government is in force, the Covenant requires States to adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to ensure that citizens have an effective opportunity to enjoy the rights it protects. Article 25 lies at the core of democratic government based on the consent of the people and in conformity with the principles of the Covenant.
x x x x
15.  The effective implementation of the right and the opportunity to stand for elective office ensures that persons entitled to vote have a free choice of candidates. Any restrictions on the right to stand for election, such as minimum age, must be justifiable on objective and reasonable criteria. Persons who are otherwise eligible to stand for election should not be excluded by unreasonable or discriminatory requirements such as education, residence or descent, or by reason of political affiliation. No person should suffer discrimination or disadvantage of any kind because of that person's candidacy. States parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which exclude any group or category of persons from elective office.
[50]
We stress, however, that although this Court stands willing to assume the responsibility of giving effect to the Philippines' international law obligations, the blanket invocation of international law is not the panacea for all social ills. We refer now to the petitioner's invocation of the 
Yogyakarta Principles 
(the Application of International Human Rights Law In Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity),
[51]
 which petitioner declares to reflect binding principles of international law.
At this time, we are not prepared to declare that these 
Yogyakarta Principles
 contain norms that are obligatory on the Philippines. There are declarations and obligations outlined in said Principles which are not reflective of the current state of international law, and do not find basis in any of the sources of international law enumerated under Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.
[52]
 Petitioner has not undertaken any objective and rigorous analysis of these alleged principles of international law to ascertain their true status.
We also hasten to add that not everything that society - or a certain segment of society - wants or demands is automatically a human right.  This is not an arbitrary human intervention that may be added to or subtracted from at will.  It is unfortunate that much of what passes for human rights today is a much broader context of needs that identifies many social desires as rights in order to further claims that international law obliges states to sanction these innovations. This has the effect of diluting real human rights, and is a result of the notion that if "wants" are couched in "rights" language, then they are no longer controversial.
Using even the most liberal of lenses, these 
Yogyakarta Principles
, consisting of a declaration formulated by various international law professors, are - at best - 
de lege ferenda 
- and do not constitute binding obligations on the Philippines.  Indeed, so much of contemporary international law is characterized by the "soft law" nomenclature, 
i.e
., international law is full of principles that promote international cooperation, harmony, and respect for human rights, most of which amount to no more than well-meaning desires, without the support of either State practice or 
opinio juris.
[53]
As a final note, we cannot help but observe that the social issues presented by this case are emotionally charged, societal attitudes are in flux, even the psychiatric and religious communities are divided in opinion. This Court's role is not to impose its own view of acceptable behavior. Rather, it is to apply the Constitution and laws as best as it can, uninfluenced by public opinion, and confident in the knowledge that our democracy is resilient enough to withstand vigorous debate.

 In BERNAS, THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES: A COMMENTARY 139-140 (2009), Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J. writes:
For determining the reasonableness of classification, later jurisprudence has developed three kinds of test[s] depending on the subject matter involved. The most demanding is the strict scrutiny test which requires the government to show that the challenged classification serves a compelling state interest and that the classification is necessary to serve that interest. This [case] is used in cases involving classifications based on race, national origin, religion, alienage, denial of the right to vote, interstate migration, access to courts, and other rights recognized as fundamental.
Next is the intermediate or middle-tier scrutiny test which requires government to show that the challenged classification serves an important state interest and that the classification is at least substantially related to serving that interest. This is applied to suspect classifications like gender or illegitimacy.
The most liberal is the minimum or rational basis scrutiny according to which government need only show that the challenged classification is rationally related to serving a legitimate state interest. This is the traditional rationality test and it applies to all subjects other than those listed above.

 The OSG argues that "[w]hile it is true that LGBTs are immutably males and females, and they are protected by the same Bill of Rights that applies to all citizens alike, it cannot be denied that as a sector, LGBTs have their own special interests and concerns."

 Supra note 26.
[41]
 In 
Bowers v. Hardwick
, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), the US Supreme Court first upheld the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law that criminalized oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults when applied to homosexuals.  Seventeen years later the Supreme Court directly overruled 
Bowers
 in 
Lawrence v. Texas
, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), holding that "
Bowers
 was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today."
In 
Lawrence
, the US Supreme Court has held that the liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to choose to enter into intimate relationships, whether or not said relationships were entitled to formal or legal recognition.
Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack. Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.
The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. "It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter." The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.
In similar fashion, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the avowed state interest in protecting public morals did not justify interference into private acts between homosexuals. In 
Norris v. Ireland, 
the European Court held that laws criminalizing same-sex sexual conduct violated the right to privacy enshrined in the European Convention.
The Government are in effect saying that the Court is precluded from reviewing Ireland's observance of its obligation not to exceed what is necessary in a democratic society when the contested interference with an Article 8 (Art. 8) right is in the interests of the "protection of morals". The Court cannot accept such an interpretation. x x x.
x x x The present case concerns a most intimate aspect of private life. Accordingly, there must exist particularly serious reasons before interferences on the part of public authorities can be legitimate x x x.
x x x  Although members of the public who regard homosexuality as immoral may be shocked, offended or disturbed by the commission by others of private homosexual acts, this cannot on its own warrant the application of penal sanctions when it is consenting adults alone who are involved. (

Marangos v.Cyprus
 (application no. 31106/96, Commission's report of 3 December 1997, unpublished)).
The United Nations Human Rights Committee came to a similar conclusion in 
Toonen v. Australia
 (Comm. No. 488/1992 U.N. GAOR Hum. Rts. Comm., 50th Sess., U.N. Doc. CCPR/c/50/D/488/1992 (1994)), involving a complaint that Tasmanian laws criminalizing consensual sex between adult males violated the right to privacy under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The Committee held:
x x x it is undisputed that adult consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of `privacy' x x x any interference with privacy must be proportional to the end sought and be necessary in the circumstances of any given case.

The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.
It also found that banning LGBT parades violated the group's freedom of assembly and association. Referring to the hallmarks of a "democratic society", the Court has attached particular importance to pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position.

Note that while the state is not permitted to discriminate against homosexuals, private individuals cannot be compelled to accept or condone homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior. In
 Hurley
 v. 
Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.
 (515 U.S. 557 (1995))
,
 the US Supreme Court discussed whether anti-discrimination legislation operated to require the organizers of a private St.Patrick's Day parade to include among the marchers an Irish-American gay, lesbian, and bisexual group. The court held that private citizens organizing a public demonstration may not be compelled by the state to include groups that impart a message the organizers do not want to be included in their demonstration. The court observed:
"[A] contingent marching behind the organization's banner would at least bear witness to the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified social acceptance as heterosexualsx x x. The parade's organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality to be so, or they may object to unqualified social acceptance of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason, it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's power to control."
So, too, in 
Boy Scouts of America  v. Dale 
(530 U.S. 640 [2000]), the US Supreme Court held that the Boy Scouts of America could not be compelled to accept a homosexual as a scoutmaster, because "the Boy Scouts believe that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill in its youth members; it will not "promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior."
When an expressive organization is compelled to associate with a person whose views the group does not accept, the organization's message is undermined; the organization is understood to embrace, or at the very least tolerate, the views of the persons linked with them. The scoutmaster's presence "would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior."

 In 
Toonen v. Australia, 
supra note 42, the Human Rights Committee noted that "in its view the reference to `sex' in Articles 2, paragraph 2, and 26 is to be taken as including sexual orientation."
[49]
 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has dealt with the matter in its General Comments, the interpretative texts it issues to explicate the full meaning of the provisions of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In General Comments Nos. 18 of 2005 (on the right to work) (Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 18: The right to work, E/C.12/GC/18, November 24, 2005), 15 of 2002 (on the right to water) (Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 15: The right to water, E/C.12/2002/11, November 26, 2002) and 14 of 2000 (on the right to the highest attainable standard of health) (Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 14: The right to the highest attainable standard of health, E/C.12/2000/4, August 14, 2000), it has indicated that the Covenant proscribes any discrimination on the basis of, inter-alia, sex and sexual orientation.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) has also dealt with the issue in a General Comment. In its General Comment No. 4 of 2003, it stated that, "State parties have the obligation to ensure that all human beings below 18 enjoy all the rights set forth in the Convention [on the Rights of the Child] without discrimination (Article 2), including with regard to ``race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status''. These grounds also cover [inter alia] sexual orientation". (Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 4: Adolescent health and development in the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, July 1, 2003, CRC/GC/2003/4).
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), has, on a number of occasions, criticized States for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. For example, it also addressed the situation in Kyrgyzstan and recommended that, "lesbianism be reconceptualized as a sexual orientation and that penalties for its practice be abolished" (Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women regarding Kyrgyzstan, February 5, 1999, A/54/38 at par. 128).

 The 
Yogyakarta Principles
 on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity is a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity, intended to address documented evidence of abuse of rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. It contains 29 Principles adopted by human rights practitioners and experts, together with recommendations to governments, regional intergovernmental institutions, civil society, and the United Nations.
[52]
 One example is Principle 3 (The Right to Recognition Before the Law), which provides:
Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. Persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities shall enjoy legal capacity in all aspects of life. Each person's self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilization or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity.No status, such as marriage or parenthood, may be invoked as such to prevent the legal recognition of a person's gender identity. No one shall be subjected to pressure to conceal, suppress or deny their sexual orientation or gender identity.
States shall:
a) Ensure that all persons are accorded legal capacity in civil matters, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and the opportunity to exercise that capacity, including equal rights to conclude contracts, and to administer, own, acquire (including through inheritance), manage, enjoy and dispose of property;
b) 
Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to fully respect and legally recognise each person's self-defined gender identity;
c) 
Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that procedures exist whereby all State-issued identity papers which indicate a person's gender/sex -- including birth certificates, passports, electoral records and other documents -- reflect the person's profound self-defined gender identity;
d) Ensure that such procedures are efficient, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect the dignity and privacy of the person concerned;
e) Ensure that changes to identity documents will be recognized in all contexts where the identification or disaggregation of persons by gender is required by law or policy;
f)  Undertake targeted programmes to provide social support for all persons experiencing gender transitioning or reassignment. (Emphasis ours)

, G.R. No. 173034, October 9, 2007, 535 SCRA 265, where we explained that 
"soft law" does not fall into any of the categories of international law set forth in Article 38, Chapter III of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice.
 
It is, however, an expression of non-binding norms, principles, and practices that influence state behavior. Certain declarations and resolutions of the UN General Assembly fall under this category.
SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
PUNO, 
C.J.
:
I concur with the groundbreaking 
ponencia

of my esteemed colleague, Mr. Justice Mariano C. del Castillo.
Nonetheless, I respectfully submit this separate opinion to underscore
some points that I deem significant.
FIRST
. The assailed Resolutions of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) run afoul of the non-establishment clause
[1]

of the Constitution. There was cypher effort on the part of the COMELEC
to couch its reasoning in legal - much less constitutional - terms, as
it denied Ang Ladlad's petition for registration as a sectoral party
principally on the ground that it "tolerates immorality which offends
religious (
i.e.
, Christian
[2]
 and Muslim
[3]
)
 
beliefs."
To be sure, the COMELEC's ruling is completely antithetical to the
fundamental rule that "[t]he public morality expressed in the law is 
necessarily secular
[,] for in our constitutional order, the religion clauses prohibit the state from establishing a religion, 
including the morality it sanctions
."
[4]
 As we explained in 
Estrada v. Escritor,
[5]
 
the
requirement of an articulable and discernible secular purpose is meant
to give flesh to the constitutional policy of full religious freedom
for all, 
viz.:
Religion also dictates "how
we ought to live" for the nature of religion is not just to know, but
often, to act in accordance with man's "views of his relations to His
Creator." But the Establishment Clause puts a negative bar against
establishment of this morality arising from one religion or the other,
and implies the affirmative "establishment" of a civil order for the
resolution of public moral disputes. 
This agreement on a secular
mechanism is the price of ending the "war of all sects against all";
the establishment of a secular public moral order is the social
contract produced by religious truce. 
Thus, when the law
speaks of "immorality" in the Civil Service Law or "immoral" in the
Code of Professional Responsibility for lawyers, or "public morals" in
the Revised Penal Code, or "morals" in the New Civil Code, or "moral
character" in the Constitution, the distinction between public and
secular morality on the one hand, and religious morality, on the other,
should be kept in mind. The morality referred to in the law is public
and necessarily secular, not religious as the dissent of Mr. Justice
Carpio holds. "Religious teachings as expressed in public debate may
influence the civil public order but public moral disputes may be
resolved only on grounds articulable in secular terms." 
Otherwise,
if government relies upon religious beliefs in formulating public
policies and morals, the resulting policies and morals would require
conformity to what some might regard as religious programs or agenda.
The non-believers would therefore be compelled to conform to a standard
of conduct buttressed by a religious belief, i.e., to a "compelled
religion;" anathema to religious freedom. Likewise, if government based
its actions upon religious beliefs, it would tacitly approve or endorse
that belief and thereby also tacitly disapprove contrary religious or
non-religious views that would not support the policy. As a result,
government will not provide full religious freedom for all its
citizens, or even make it appear that those whose beliefs are
disapproved are second-class citizens.
 Expansive religious freedom
therefore requires that government be neutral in matters of religion;
governmental reliance upon religious justification is inconsistent with
this policy of neutrality.
[6]
 (citations omitted and italics supplied)
Consequently, the assailed resolutions of the COMELEC are violative of the constitutional directive that 
no religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights
.
[7]

Ang Ladlad's right of political participation was unduly infringed when
the COMELEC, swayed by the private biases and personal prejudices of
its constituent members, arrogated unto itself the role of a religious
court or worse, a morality police.
The COMELEC attempts to disengage itself from this "excessive entanglement"
[8]
 with religion by arguing that we "cannot ignore our strict religious upbringing, whether Christian or Muslim"
[9]

since the "moral precepts espoused by [these] religions have slipped
into society and ... are now publicly accepted moral norms."
[10]

However, as correctly observed by Mr. Justice del Castillo, the
Philippines has not seen fit to disparage homosexual conduct as to
actually criminalize it. Indeed, even if the State has legislated to
this effect, the law is vulnerable to constitutional attack on privacy
grounds.
[11]
  These alleged "generally accepted public morals" have not, in reality, crossed over from the religious to the secular sphere.
Some
people may find homosexuality and bisexuality deviant, odious, and
offensive. Nevertheless, private discrimination, however unfounded,
cannot be attributed or ascribed to the State. Mr. Justice Kennedy,
speaking for the United States (U.S.) Supreme Court in the landmark
case of 
Lawrence v. Texas,
[12]
 opined:
It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in 
Bowers

was making the broader point that for centuries there have been
powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The
condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right
and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For
many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep
convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they
aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These
considerations do not answer the question before us, however. 
The
issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce
these views on the whole society through operation of the ... law. "Our
obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own
moral code."
[13]
SECOND. 
The COMELEC capitalized on Ang Ladlad's definition of the term "sexual orientation,"
[14]
 as well as its citation of the number of Filipino men who have sex with men,
[15]
 as basis for the declaration that the party espouses and advocates sexual immorality. 
This
position, however, would deny homosexual and bisexual individuals a
fundamental element of personal identity and a legitimate exercise of
personal liberty
. For, the "ability to [independently] define one's
identity that is central to any concept of liberty" cannot truly be
exercised in a vacuum; we all depend on the "emotional enrichment from
close ties with others."
[16]
 As Mr. Justice Blackmun so eloquently said in his stinging dissent in 
Bowers v. Hardwick
[17]
 
(overturned by the United States Supreme Court seventeen years later in 
Lawrence v. Texas
[18]
):
Only
the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy
is "a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family
life, community welfare, and the development of human personality
[.]"
[19]

The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant way
through their intimate sexual relationships with others suggests, in a
Nation as diverse as ours, that there may be many "right" ways of
conducting those relationships, and that much of the richness of a
relationship will 
come from the freedom an individual has to choose the form and nature of these intensely personal bonds
.
[20]
In a variety of circumstances we have recognized that 
a
necessary corollary of giving individuals freedom to choose how to
conduct their lives is acceptance of the fact that different
individuals will make different choices
. For example, in holding
that the clearly important state interest in public education should
give way to a competing claim by the Amish to the effect that extended
formal schooling threatened their way of life, the Court declared:
"There can be no assumption that today's majority is `right' and the
Amish and others like them are `wrong.' A way of life that is odd or
even erratic but interferes with no rights or interests of others is
not to be condemned because it is different."
[21]

The Court claims that its decision today merely refuses to recognize a
fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy; what the Court really
has refused to recognize is 
the fundamental interest all individuals have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations with others
. (italics supplied)
It has been said that freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.
[22]
 Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.
[23]

These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a
person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and
autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the due process
clause.
[24]
 At the heart of
liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of
meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.
[25]
 Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.
[26]
 
Lawrence v. Texas
[27]
 is again instructive:
To say that the issue in 
Bowers

was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the
claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married
couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have
sexual intercourse. The laws involved in 
Bowers
 and here are,
to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a
particular sexual act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more
far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human
conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.
The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether
or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty
of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
This,
as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a
court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its
boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law
protects. 
It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose
to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and
their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.
When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another
person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is
more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows
homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

THIRD. 
The 
ponencia 
of
Mr. Justice del Castillo refused to characterize homosexuals and
bisexuals as a class in themselves for purposes of the equal protection
clause. Accordingly, it struck down the assailed Resolutions using the
most liberal basis of judicial scrutiny, the rational basis test,
according to which government need only show that the challenged
classification is rationally related to serving a legitimate state
interest.
I humbly submit, however, that a classification based on gender or sexual orientation is a 
quasi-suspect classification
, as to trigger a 
heightened level of review
.
Preliminarily,
in our jurisdiction, the standard and analysis of equal protection
challenges in the main have followed the rational basis test, coupled
with a deferential attitude to legislative classifications and a
reluctance to invalidate a law unless there is a showing of a clear and
unequivocal breach of the Constitution.
[28]
 However, 
Central Bank Employees Association, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
,
[29]

carved out an exception to this general rule, such that prejudice to
persons accorded special protection by the Constitution requires
stricter judicial scrutiny than mere rationality, 
viz.
:
Congress
retains its wide discretion in providing for a valid classification,
and its policies should be accorded recognition and respect by the
courts of justice except when they run afoul of the Constitution. 
The
deference stops where the classification violates a fundamental right,
or prejudices persons accorded special protection by the Constitution.
When these violations arise, this Court must discharge its primary role
as the vanguard of constitutional guaranties, and require a stricter
and more exacting adherence to constitutional limitations
. Rational basis should not suffice. (citations omitted and italics supplied)
Considering
thus that labor enjoys such special and protected status under our
fundamental law, the Court ruled in favor of the Central Bank Employees
Association, Inc. in this wise:
While R.A. No. 7653
started as a valid measure well within the legislature's power, we hold
that the enactment of subsequent laws exempting all rank-and-file
employees of other GFIs leeched all validity out of the challenged
proviso.
x x x x
According to petitioner, the last
proviso of Section 15(c), Article II of R.A. No. 7653 is also violative
of the equal protection clause because after it was enacted, the
charters of the GSIS, LBP, DBP and SSS were also amended, but the
personnel of the latter GFIs were all exempted from the coverage of the
SSL. Thus, within the class of rank-and-file personnel of GFIs, the BSP
rank-and-file are also discriminated upon.
Indeed, we take
judicial notice that after the new BSP charter was enacted in 1993,
Congress also undertook the amendment of the charters of the GSIS, LBP,
DBP and SSS, and three other GFIs, from 1995 to 2004, 
viz.
:
x x x x
It
is noteworthy, as petitioner points out, that the subsequent charters
of the seven other GFIs share this common proviso: a blanket exemption
of all their employees from the coverage of the SSL, expressly or
impliedly...
x x x x
The abovementioned subsequent
enactments, however, constitute significant changes in circumstance
that considerably alter the reasonability of the continued operation of
the last proviso of Section 15(c), Article II of Republic Act No. 7653,
thereby exposing the proviso to more serious scrutiny. This time, the
scrutiny relates to the constitutionality of the classification --
albeit made indirectly as a consequence of the passage of eight other
laws -- between the rank-and-file of the BSP and the seven other GFIs.
The classification must not only be reasonable, but must also apply
equally to all members of the class. The proviso may be fair on its
face and impartial in appearance but it cannot be grossly
discriminatory in its operation, so as practically to make unjust
distinctions between persons who are without differences.
Stated
differently, the second level of inquiry deals with the following
questions: Given that Congress chose to exempt other GFIs (aside the
BSP) from the coverage of the SSL, can the exclusion of the
rank-and-file employees of the BSP stand constitutional scrutiny in the
light of the fact that Congress did not exclude the rank-and-file
employees of the other GFIs? Is Congress' power to classify so
unbridled as to sanction unequal and discriminatory treatment, simply
because the inequity manifested itself, not instantly through a single
overt act, but gradually and progressively, through seven separate acts
of Congress? Is the right to equal protection of the law bounded in
time and space that: (a) the right can only be invoked against a
classification made directly and deliberately, as opposed to a
discrimination that arises indirectly, or as a consequence of several
other acts; and (b) is the legal analysis confined to determining the
validity within the parameters of the statute or ordinance (where the
inclusion or exclusion is articulated), thereby proscribing any
evaluation vis-Ã -vis the grouping, or the lack thereof, among several
similar enactments made over a period of time?
In this second
level of scrutiny, the inequality of treatment cannot be justified on
the mere assertion that each exemption (granted to the seven other
GFIs) rests "on a policy determination by the legislature." All
legislative enactments necessarily rest on a policy determination --
even those that have been declared to contravene the Constitution.
Verily, if this could serve as a magic wand to sustain the validity of
a statute, then no due process and equal protection challenges would
ever prosper. There is nothing inherently sacrosanct in a policy
determination made by Congress or by the Executive; it cannot run riot
and overrun the ramparts of protection of the Constitution.
x x x x
In
the case at bar, it is precisely the fact that as regards the exemption
from the SSL, there are no characteristics peculiar only to the seven
GFIs or their rank-and-file so as to justify the exemption which BSP
rank-and-file employees were denied (not to mention the anomaly of the
SEC getting one). The distinction made by the law is not only
superficial, but also arbitrary. It is not based on substantial
distinctions that make real differences between the BSP rank-and-file
and the seven other GFIs.
x x x x
The disparity of
treatment between BSP rank-and-file and the rank-and-file of the other
seven GFIs definitely bears the unmistakable badge of invidious
discrimination -- no one can, with candor and fairness, deny the
discriminatory character of the subsequent blanket and total exemption
of the seven other GFIs from the SSL when such was withheld from the
BSP. Alikes are being treated as unalikes without any rational basis.
x x x x
Thus,
the two-tier analysis made in the case at bar of the challenged
provision, and its conclusion of unconstitutionality by subsequent
operation, are in cadence and in consonance with the progressive trend
of other jurisdictions and in international law. 
There should be no
hesitation in using the equal protection clause as a major cutting edge
to eliminate every conceivable irrational discrimination in our
society. Indeed, the social justice imperatives in the Constitution,
coupled with the special status and protection afforded to labor,
compel this approach. 
Apropos the special protection afforded to labor under our Constitution and international law, we held in 
International School Alliance of Educators v. Quisumbing
:
That
public policy abhors inequality and discrimination is beyond
contention. Our Constitution and laws reflect the policy against these
evils. The Constitution in the Article on Social Justice and Human
Rights exhorts Congress to "give highest priority to the enactment of
measures that protect and enhance the right of all people to human
dignity, reduce social, economic, and political inequalities." The very
broad Article 19 of the Civil Code requires every person, "in the
exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, [to] act
with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good
faith."
International law, which springs from general principles
of law, likewise proscribes discrimination. General principles of law
include principles of equity, i.e., the general principles of fairness
and justice, based on the test of what is reasonable. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic,
Social, and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention
against Discrimination in Education, the Convention (No. 111)
Concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation --
all embody the general principle against discrimination, the very
antithesis of fairness and justice. The Philippines, through its
Constitution, has incorporated this principle as part of its national
laws.
In the workplace, where the relations between capital and
labor are often skewed in favor of capital, inequality and
discrimination by the employer are all the more reprehensible.
The
Constitution specifically provides that labor is entitled to "humane
conditions of work." These conditions are not restricted to the
physical workplace -- the factory, the office or the field -- but
include as well the manner by which employers treat their employees.
The
Constitution also directs the State to promote "equality of employment
opportunities for all." Similarly, the Labor Code provides that the
State shall "ensure equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race or
creed." It would be an affront to both the spirit and letter of these
provisions if the State, in spite of its primordial obligation to
promote and ensure equal employment opportunities, closes its eyes to
unequal and discriminatory terms and conditions of employment.
xxx          xxx          xxx
Notably, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, in Article 7 thereof, provides:
The
States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone
to the enjoyment of just and [favorable] conditions of work, which
ensure, in particular:
a. Remuneration which provides all workers, as a minimum, with:
i.
Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without
distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed
conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay
for equal work;
xxx          xxx          xxx
The
foregoing provisions impregnably institutionalize in this jurisdiction
the long honored legal truism of "equal pay for equal work." Persons
who work with substantially equal qualifications, skill, effort and
responsibility, under similar conditions, should be paid similar
salaries.
x x x x
Under
most circumstances, the Court will exercise judicial restraint in
deciding questions of constitutionality, recognizing the broad
discretion given to Congress in exercising its legislative power.
Judicial scrutiny would be based on the "rational basis" test, and the
legislative discretion would be given deferential treatment.
But
if the challenge to the statute is premised on the denial of a
fundamental right, or the perpetuation of prejudice against persons
favored by the Constitution with special protection, judicial scrutiny
ought to be more strict. A weak and watered down view would call for
the abdication of this Court's solemn duty to strike down any law
repugnant to the Constitution and the rights it enshrines.
 This is
true whether the actor committing the unconstitutional act is a private
person or the government itself or one of its instrumentalities.
Oppressive acts will be struck down regardless of the character or
nature of the actor.
In the case at bar, the challenged
proviso operates on the basis of the salary grade or officer-employee
status. It is akin to a distinction based on economic class and status,
with the higher grades as recipients of a benefit specifically withheld
from the lower grades
. Officers of the BSP now receive higher
compensation packages that are competitive with the industry, while the
poorer, low-salaried employees are limited to the rates prescribed by
the SSL. The implications are quite disturbing: BSP rank-and-file
employees are paid the strictly regimented rates of the SSL while
employees higher in rank -- possessing higher and better education and
opportunities for career advancement -- are given higher compensation
packages to entice them to stay. 
Considering that majority, if not
all, the rank-and-file employees consist of people whose status and
rank in life are less and limited, especially in terms of job
marketability, it is they -- and not the officers -- who have the real
economic and financial need for the adjustment. This is in accord with
the policy of the Constitution "to free the people from poverty,
provide adequate social services, extend to them a decent standard of
living, and improve the quality of life for all." Any act of Congress
that runs counter to this constitutional desideratum deserves strict
scrutiny by this Court before it can pass muster
. (citations omitted and italics supplied)
Corollarily,
American case law provides that a state action questioned on equal
protection grounds is subject to one of three levels of judicial
scrutiny. The level of review, on a sliding scale basis, varies with
the type of classification utilized and the nature of the right
affected.
[30]
If a
legislative classification disadvantages a "suspect class" or impinges
upon the exercise of a "fundamental right," then the courts will employ
strict scrutiny and the statute must fall unless the government can
demonstrate that the classification has been precisely tailored to
serve a compelling governmental interest.
[31]

Over the years, the United States Supreme Court has determined that
suspect classes for equal protection purposes include classifications
based on race, religion, alienage, national origin, and ancestry.
[32]

The underlying rationale of this theory is that where legislation
affects discrete and insular minorities, the presumption of
constitutionality fades because traditional political processes may
have broken down.
[33]
 In such
a case, the State bears a heavy burden of justification, and the
government action will be closely scrutinized in light of its asserted
purpose.
[34]
On the
other hand, if the classification, while not facially invidious,
nonetheless gives rise to recurring constitutional difficulties, or if
a classification disadvantages a "quasi-suspect class," it will be
treated under intermediate or heightened review.
[35]

To survive intermediate scrutiny, the law must not only further an
important governmental interest and be substantially related to that
interest, but the justification for the classification must be genuine
and must not depend on broad generalizations.
[36]
 Noteworthy, and of special interest to us in this case, 
quasi-suspect classes include classifications based on gender
 or illegitimacy.
[37]
If neither strict nor intermediate scrutiny is appropriate, then the statute will be tested for mere rationality.
[38]

This is a relatively relaxed standard reflecting the Court's awareness
that the drawing of lines which creates distinctions is peculiarly a
legislative task and an unavoidable one.
[39]

The presumption is in favor of the classification, of the
reasonableness and fairness of state action, and of legitimate grounds
of distinction, if any such grounds exist, on which the State acted.
[40]
Instead
of adopting a rigid formula to determine whether certain legislative
classifications warrant more demanding constitutional analysis, the
United States Supreme Court has looked to four factors,
[41]
 thus:
(1) The history of invidious discrimination against the class burdened by the legislation;
[42]
(2) Whether the characteristics that distinguish the class indicate a typical class member's ability to contribute to society;
[43]
(3) Whether the distinguishing characteristic is "immutable" or beyond the class members' control;
[44]
 and
(4) The political power of the subject class.
[45]
These factors, it must be emphasized, are 
not
 constitutive essential elements
 of a suspect or quasi-suspect class, as to individually demand a certain weight.
[46]

The U.S. Supreme Court has applied the four factors in a flexible
manner; it has neither required, nor even discussed, every factor in
every case.
[47]
 Indeed, no
single talisman can define those groups likely to be the target of
classifications offensive to the equal protection clause and therefore
warranting heightened or strict scrutiny; experience, not abstract
logic, must be the primary guide.
[48]
In
any event, the first two factors - history of intentional
discrimination and relationship of classifying characteristic to a
person's ability to contribute - have always been present when
heightened scrutiny has been applied.
[49]

They have been critical to the analysis and could be considered as
prerequisites to concluding a group is a suspect or quasi-suspect class.
[50]

However, the last two factors - immutability of the characteristic and
political powerlessness of the group - are considered simply to
supplement the analysis as a means to discern whether a need for
heightened scrutiny exists.
[51]
Guided
by this framework, and considering further that classifications based
on sex or gender - albeit on a male/female, man/woman basis - have been
previously held to trigger heightened scrutiny, I respectfully submit
that classification on the basis of sexual orientation (
i.e., 
homosexuality and/or bisexuality) is a quasi-suspect classification that prompts intermediate review.
The
first consideration is whether homosexuals have suffered a history of
purposeful unequal treatment because of their sexual orientation.
[52]

One cannot, in good faith, dispute that gay and lesbian persons
historically have been, and continue to be, the target of purposeful
and pernicious discrimination due solely to their sexual orientation.
[53]
 Paragraphs 6 and 7 of Ang Ladlad's Petition for Registration for party-list accreditation in fact state:
6. There have been documented cases of discrimination and violence perpetuated against the LGBT Community, among which are:
(a)
Effeminate or gay youths being beaten up by their parents and/or
guardians to make them conform to standard gender norms of behavior;
(b)
Fathers and/or guardians who allow their daughters who are butch
lesbians to be raped[, so as] to "cure" them into becoming straight
women;
(c) Effeminate gays and butch lesbians are kicked out of school, NGOs, and choirs because of their identity;
(d) Effeminate youths and masculine young women are refused admission from 
(sic) 
certain schools, are suspended or are automatically put on probation;
(e) Denial of jobs, promotions, trainings and other work benefits once one's sexual orientation and gender identity is 
(sic) 
revealed;
(f)
Consensual partnerships or relationships by gays and lesbians who are
already of age, are broken up by their parents or guardians using the
[A]nti-kidnapping [L]aw;
(g) Pray-overs, exorcisms, and other religious cures are performed on gays and lesbians to "reform" them;
(h) Young gays and lesbians are forcibly subjected to psychiatric counseling and therapy to cure them[,] despite the de-listing 
(sic) 
of homosexuality and lesbianism as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association;
(i)
Transgenders, or individuals who were born mail but who self-identity
as women and dress as such, are denied entry or services in certain
restaurants and establishments; and
(j) Several murders from the
years 2003-3006 were committed against gay men, but were not
acknowledged by police as hate crimes or violent acts of bigotry.
7.
In the recent May 2009 US asylum case of Philip Belarmino, he testified
that as a young gay person in the Philippines, he was subjected to a
variety of sexual abuse and violence, including repeated rapes[,] which
he could not report to [the] police [or speak of] to his own parents.
Accordingly,
this history of discrimination suggests that any legislative burden
placed on lesbian and gay people as a class is "more likely than others
to reflect deep-seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in
pursuit of some legitimate objective."
[54]
A second relevant consideration is whether the character-in-issue is related to the person's ability to contribute to society.
[55]

Heightened scrutiny is applied when the classification bears no
relationship to this ability; the existence of this factor indicates
the classification is likely based on irrelevant stereotypes and
prejudice.
[56]
 Insofar as sexual orientation is concerned, it is gainful to repair to 
Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health,
[57]
 
viz
.:
The
defendants also concede that sexual orientation bears no relation to a
person's ability to participate in or contribute to society, a fact
that many courts have acknowledged, as well. x x x If homosexuals were
afflicted with some sort of impediment to their ability to perform and
to contribute to society, the entire phenomenon of `staying in the
[c]loset' and of `coming out' would not exist; their impediment would
betray their status. x x x In this critical respect, gay persons stand
in stark contrast to other groups that have been denied suspect or
quasi-suspect class recognition, despite a history of discrimination,
because the distinguishing characteristics of those groups adversely
affect their ability or capacity to perform certain functions or to
discharge certain responsibilities in society.
[58]
Unlike
the characteristics unique to those groups, however, "homosexuality
bears no relation at all to [an] individual's ability to contribute
fully to society."
[59]
 
Indeed,
because an individual's homosexual orientation "implies no impairment
in judgment, stability, reliability or general social or vocational
capabilities";
[60]
 the
observation of the United States Supreme Court that race, alienage and
national origin -all suspect classes entitled to the highest level of
constitutional protection- "are so seldom relevant to the achievement
of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such
considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy"
[61]
 is no less applicable to gay persons
. (italics supplied)
Clearly,
homosexual orientation is no more relevant to a person's ability to
perform and contribute to society than is heterosexual orientation.
[62]
A
third factor that courts have considered in determining whether the
members of a class are entitled to heightened protection for equal
protection purposes is whether the attribute or characteristic that
distinguishes them is immutable or otherwise beyond their control.
[63]

Of course, the characteristic that distinguishes gay persons from
others and qualifies them for recognition as a distinct and discrete
group is the characteristic that historically has resulted in their
social and legal ostracism, namely, their attraction to persons of the
same sex.
[64]
Immutability
is a factor in determining the appropriate level of scrutiny because
the inability of a person to change a characteristic that is used to
justify different treatment makes the discrimination violative of the
rather "`basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear
some relationship to individual responsibility.'"
[65]

However, the constitutional relevance of the immutability factor is not
reserved to those instances in which the trait defining the burdened
class is absolutely impossible to change.
[66]

That is, the immutability prong of the suspectness inquiry surely is
satisfied when the identifying trait is "so central to a person's
identity that it would be abhorrent for government to penalize a person
for refusing to change [it]."
[67]
Prescinding
from these premises, it is not appropriate to require a person to
repudiate or change his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid
discriminatory treatment, because a person's sexual orientation is so
integral an aspect of one's identity.
[68]

Consequently, because sexual orientation "may be altered [if at all]
only at the expense of significant damage to the individual's sense of
self," classifications based thereon "are no less entitled to
consideration as a suspect or quasi-suspect class than any other group
that has been deemed to exhibit an immutable characteristic."
[69]

Stated differently, sexual orientation is not the type of human trait
that allows courts to relax their standard of review because the
barrier is temporary or susceptible to self-help.
[70]
The final factor that bears consideration is whether the group is "a minority or politically powerless."
[71]

However, the political powerlessness factor of the level-of-scrutiny
inquiry does not require a showing of absolute political powerlessness.
[72]

Rather, the touchstone of the analysis should be "whether the group
lacks sufficient political strength to bring a prompt end to the
prejudice and discrimination through traditional political means."
[73]
Applying
this standard, it would not be difficult to conclude that gay persons
are entitled to heightened constitutional protection despite some
recent political progress.
[74]

The discrimination that they have suffered has been so pervasive and
severe - even though their sexual orientation has no bearing at all on
their ability to contribute to or perform in society - that it is
highly unlikely that legislative enactments alone will suffice to
eliminate that discrimination.
[75]

Furthermore, insofar as the LGBT community plays a role in the
political process, it is apparent that their numbers reflect their
status as a small and insular minority.
[76]
It
is therefore respectfully submitted that any state action singling
lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans-genders out for disparate treatment
is subject to heightened judicial scrutiny to ensure that it is not the
product of historical prejudice and stereotyping.
[77]
In
this case, the assailed Resolutions of the COMELEC unmistakably fail
the intermediate level of review. Regrettably, they betray no more than
bigotry and intolerance; they raise the inevitable inference that the
disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons
affected
[78]
 (that is, lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-gendered individuals). In our constitutional system, status-based classification 
undertaken for its own sake 
cannot survive.
[79]
FOURTH. 
It
has been suggested that the LGBT community cannot participate in the
party-list system because it is not a "marginalized and
underrepresented sector" enumerated either in the Constitution
[80]
 or Republic Act No. (RA) 7941.
[81]
 However, this position is belied by our ruling in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. COMELEC,
[82]
 
where we clearly held that the enumeration of marginalized and underrepresented sectors in RA 7941 is 
not exclusive
.
I
likewise see no logical or factual obstacle to classifying the members
of the LGBT community as marginalized and underrepresented, considering
their long history (and indeed, ongoing narrative) of persecution,
discrimination, and pathos. 
In my humble view, marginalization for purposes of party-list representation encompasses social marginalization as well.

To hold otherwise is tantamount to trivializing socially marginalized
groups as "mere passive recipients of the State's benevolence" and
denying them the right to "participate directly [in the mainstream of
representative democracy] in the enactment of laws designed to benefit
them."
[83]
 The party-list system could not have been conceptualized to perpetuate this injustice.
Accordingly, I vote to grant the petition.
[1]

Section 5, Article III of the 1987 Constitution states: "No law shall
be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious
profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall
forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the
exercise of civil or political rights."
[2]

The November 11, 2009 Resolution of the COMELEC cited the following
passage from the Bible to support its holding: "For this cause God gave
them up into vile affections: for even their women did change the
natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the
men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and
receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet."
(Romans 1:26-27)
[3]
 The November 11, 2009 Resolution of the COMELEC cited the following passages from the Koran to support its holding:
Â· "For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds." (7:81)
Â· "And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!" (7.84)
Â· "He said: "O my Lord! Help Thou me against people who do mischief!" (29:30)

Several
formulations might explain our treatment of certain classifications as
"suspect." Some classifications are more likely than others to reflect
deep-seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of
some legitimate objective. Legislation predicated on such prejudice is
easily recognized as incompatible with the constitutional understanding
that each person is to be judged individually and is entitled to equal
justice under the law. Classifications treated as suspect tend to be
irrelevant to any proper legislative goal. Finally, certain groups,
indeed largely the same groups, have historically been "relegated to
such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary
protection from the majoritarian political process." The experience of
our Nation has shown that prejudice may manifest itself in the
treatment of some groups. Our response to that experience is reflected
in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Legislation
imposing special disabilities upon groups disfavored by virtue of
circumstances beyond their control suggests the kind of "class or
caste" treatment that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to abolish.

.:
Stripped
of the complicated and contentious issues of morality and religion, I
believe the basic issue here is simple: does petitioner Ang Ladlad LGBT
Party qualify, under the terms of the Constitution and RA 7941, as a
marginalized and underrepresented sector in the party-list system?
The
relevant facts are likewise relatively uncomplicated. Petitioner seeks
accreditation by the respondent Commission on Elections as a political
organization of a marginalized and underrepresented sector under the
party-list system. Finding that petitioner is not a marginalized sector
under RA 7941, the Commission on Elections denied its petition.
A SYSTEM  FOR  MARGINALIZED
AND UNDERREPRESENTED SECTORS
The
party-list system is an innovation of the 1987 Constitution. It is
essentially a tool for the advancement of social justice with the
fundamental purpose of affording opportunity to marginalized and
underrepresented sectors to participate in the shaping of public policy
and the crafting of national laws. It is premised on the proposition
that the advancement of the interests of the marginalized sectors
contributes to the advancement of the common good and of our nation's
democratic ideals.
But who are the marginalized and underrepresented sectors for whom the party-list system was designed?
THE TEXTS OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND OF RA
[1]
 7941
The
resolution of a constitutional issue primarily requires that the text
of the fundamental law be consulted. Section 5(2), Article VI of the
Constitution directs the course of our present inquiry. It provides:
SEC. 5. x x x
(2)
The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per centum of
the total number of Representatives including those under the
party-list. For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this
Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list
representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or
election 
from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural
communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by
law, except the religious sector
. (emphasis supplied)
The
Constitution left the matter of determining the groups or sectors that
may qualify as "marginalized" to the hands of Congress. Pursuant to
this constitutional mandate, RA 7941 or the Party-List System Act was
enacted in 1995. The law provides:
Section 2. 
Declaration of policy. --
 The State shall 
promote proportional representation

in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives
through a party-list system of registered national, regional and
sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will
enable Filipino citizens 
belonging to marginalized and under-represented sectors, organizations and parties
, and 
who lack well-defined political constituencies
 but 
who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole
,
to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end,
the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party
system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of
party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by
enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the
legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.

THE COURT'S PREVIOUS PRONOUNCEMENTS
As the oracle of the Constitution, this Court divined the intent of the party-list system and defined its meaning in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections
:
[2]
T
hat political parties may participate in the party-list elections does not mean, however, that 
any

political party -- or any organization or group for that matter -- may
do so. The requisite character of these parties or organizations must
be consistent with the purpose of the party-list system, as laid down
in the Constitution and RA 7941
. x x x
The Marginalized and Underrepresented to Become Lawmakers Themselves
[Section
2 of RA 7941] mandates a state policy of promoting proportional
representation by means of the Filipino-style party-list system, which
will "enable" the election to the House of Representatives of Filipino
citizens,
who belong to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties; and
who lack well-defined constituencies; but
who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will 
benefit the nation as a whole
.
The
key words in this policy are "proportional representation,"
"marginalized and underrepresented," and "lack [of] well-defined
constituencies."
"Proportional representation" here does not
refer to the number of people in a particular district, because the
party-list election is national in scope. Neither does it allude to
numerical strength in a distressed or oppressed group. Rather, 
it
refers to the representation of the "marginalized and underrepresented"
as exemplified by the enumeration in Section 5 of the law; namely,
"labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural
communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas
workers, and professionals."
However, it is not enough for
the candidate to claim representation of the marginalized and
underrepresented, because representation is easy to claim and to feign
.
The party-list organization or party must factually and truly represent
the marginalized and underrepresented constituencies mentioned in
Section 5
. Concurrently, the persons nominated by the party-list
candidate-organization must be "Filipino citizens belonging to
marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties."
Finally,
"lack of well-defined constituenc[y]" refers to the absence of a
traditionally identifiable electoral group, like voters of a
congressional district or territorial unit of government. Rather, it
points again to those with disparate interests identified with the
"marginalized or underrepresented."
In the end, the role of
the Comelec is to see to it that only those Filipinos who are
"marginalized and underrepresented" become members of Congress under
the party-list system
, Filipino-style.
The intent of the
Constitution is clear: to give genuine power to the people, not only by
giving more law to those who have less in life, but more so by enabling
them to become veritable lawmakers themselves. Consistent with this
intent, the policy of the implementing law, we repeat, is likewise
clear: "to enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and
underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, x x x, to become
members of the House of Representatives." Where the language of the law
is clear, it must be applied according to its express terms.
The
marginalized and underrepresented sectors to be represented under the
party-list system are enumerated in Section 5 of RA 7941
, which states:
"SEC. 5.  
Registration
.
-- Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization
or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the
COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition
verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to
participate in the party-list system as a national, regional or
sectoral party or organization or a coalition of such parties or
organizations, attaching thereto its constitution, by-laws, platform or
program of government, list of officers, coalition agreement and other
relevant information as the COMELEC may require: 
Provided
,

that the sector shall include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor,
indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth,
veterans, overseas workers, and professionals.
"
While
the enumeration of marginalized and underrepresented sectors is not
exclusive, it demonstrates the clear intent of the law that 
not all sectors can be represented under the party-list system
.
It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that words
employed in a statute are interpreted in connection with, and their
meaning is ascertained by reference to, the words and the phrases with
which they are associated or related. Thus, the meaning of a term in a
statute may be limited, qualified or specialized by those in immediate
association.
x x x    x x x    x x x
Indeed,
the law crafted to address the peculiar disadvantages of Payatas hovel
dwellers cannot be appropriated by the mansion owners of Forbes Park.
The interests of these two sectors are manifestly disparate; hence, the
OSG's position to treat them similarly defies reason and common sense.
In contrast, and with admirable candor, Atty. Lorna Patajo-Kapunan
admitted during the Oral Argument that a group of bankers,
industrialists and sugar planters could not join the party-list system
as representatives of their respective sectors.
While the
business moguls and the mega-rich are, numerically speaking, a tiny
minority, they are neither marginalized nor underrepresented, for the
stark reality is that their economic clout engenders political power
more awesome than their numerical limitation. Traditionally, political
power does not necessarily emanate from the size of one's constituency;
indeed, it is likely to arise more directly from the number and amount
of one's bank accounts.
It is ironic, therefore, that the
marginalized and underrepresented in our midst are the majority who
wallow in poverty, destitution and infirmity. It was for them that the
party-list system was enacted -- to give them not only genuine hope,
but genuine power; to give them the opportunity to be elected and to
represent the specific concerns of their constituencies; and simply to
give them a direct voice in Congress and in the larger affairs of the
State. In its noblest sense, the party-list system truly empowers the
masses and ushers a new hope for genuine change. Verily, 
it invites those marginalized and underrepresented 
in the past
 - the farm hands, the fisher folk, the urban poor, even those in the underground movement - to come out and participate
,
as indeed many of them came out and participated during the last
elections. The State cannot now disappoint and frustrate them by
disabling and desecrating this social justice vehicle.
x x x    x x x    x x x
Verily, 
allowing the non-marginalized and overrepresented to vie for the remaining seats under the party-list system would not only 
dilute,
 but also 
prejudice
 the chance of the marginalized and underrepresented
, contrary to the intention of the law to 
enhance

it. The party-list system is a tool for the benefit of the
underprivileged; the law could not have given the same tool to others,
to the prejudice of the intended beneficiaries.
This Court,
therefore, cannot allow the party-list system to be sullied and
prostituted by those who are neither marginalized nor underrepresented
.
It cannot let that flicker of hope be snuffed out. The clear state
policy must permeate every discussion of the qualification of political
parties and other organizations under the party-list system. (emphasis
and underscoring supplied)
Hence, in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party
, the Court stressed that the party-list system is reserved only for those sectors marginalized and underrepresented 
in the past
 (
e.g.
,
labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural
communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas
workers, professionals and even those in the underground movement who
wish to come out and participate). They are those sectors 
traditionally and historically marginalized
 and deprived of an opportunity to participate in the formulation of national policy although 
their sectoral interests are also traditionally and historically regarded as vital to the national interest
.
That is why Section 2 of RA 7941 speaks of "marginalized and
under-represented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack
well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the
formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that 
will benefit the nation as a whole
."
How
should the matter of whether a particular sectoral interest is vital to
national interest (and therefore beneficial to the nation as a whole)
be determined? Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno's opinion
[3]
 in 
Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency (BANAT) v. Commission on Elections
[4]
 offers valuable insight:
...
Similarly, limiting the party-list system to the marginalized and
excluding the major political parties from participating in the
election of their representatives is aligned with the constitutional
mandate to "reduce social, economic, and political inequalities, and
remove cultural inequalities by equitably diffusing wealth and
political power for the common good"; the right of the people and their
organizations to effective and reasonable participation at all levels
of social, political, and economic decision-making; the right of women
to opportunities that will enhance their welfare and enable them to
realize their full potential in the service of the nation; the right of
labor to participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting
their rights and benefits in keeping with its role as a primary social
economic force; the right of teachers to professional advancement; the
rights of indigenous cultural communities to the consideration of their
cultures, traditions and institutions in the formulation of national
plans and policies, and the indispensable role of the private sector in
the national economy.
As such, the interests of
marginalized sectors are by tradition and history vital to national
interest and therefore beneficial to the nation as a whole because the
Constitution declares a national policy recognizing the role of these
sectors in the nation's life. In other words, the concept of
marginalized and underrepresented sectors under the party-list scheme
has been carefully refined by concrete examples involving sectors
deemed to be significant in our legal tradition. They are essentially
sectors with a constitutional bond,
 
that is, specific sectors subject of specific provisions in the Constitution, namely, labor,
[5]
 peasant,
[6]
 urban poor,
[7]
 indigenous cultural communities,
[8]
 women,
[9]
 youth,
[10]
 veterans,
[11]
 fisherfolk,
[12]
 elderly,
[13]
 handicapped,
[14]
 overseas workers
[15]
 and professionals.
[16]
The
premise is that the advancement of the interests of these important yet
traditionally and historically marginalized sectors promotes the
national interest. The Filipino people as a whole are benefited by the
empowerment of these sectors.
The long-muffled voices of
marginalized sectors must be heard because their respective interests
are intimately and indispensably woven into the fabric of the national
democratic agenda. The social, economic and political aspects of
discrimination and marginalization should not be divorced from the role
of a particular sector or group in the advancement of the collective
goals of Philippine society as a whole. In other words, marginalized
sectors should be given a say in governance through the party-list
system, not simply because they desire to say something constructive
but because they deserve to be heard on account of their traditionally
and historically decisive role in Philippine society.
A UNIFYING THREAD
Fidelity
to the Constitution requires commitment to its text. Thus, in the
exercise of its function as official interpreter of the Constitution,
the Court should always bear in mind that judicial prudence means that
it is safer to construe the Constitution from what appears upon its
face.
[17]
With regard
to the matter of what qualifies as marginalized and underrepresented
sectors under the party-list system, Section 5(2), Article VI of the
Constitution mentions "the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous
cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be
provided by law, except the religious sector." On the other hand, the
law speaks of "labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous
cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans,
overseas workers, and professionals."
[18]
Surely,
the enumeration of sectors considered as marginalized and
underrepresented in the fundamental law and in the implementing law (RA
7941) cannot be without significance. To ignore them is to disregard
the texts of the Constitution and of RA 7941. For, indeed, the very
first of 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party
's eight guidelines
for screening party-list participants is this: the parties, sectors or
organizations "must represent the marginalized and underrepresented
groups identified in Section 5 of RA 7941."
[19]
For
this reason, I submit the majority's decision is cryptic and wanting
when it makes short shrift of the issue of whether petitioner is a
marginalized and underrepresented sector in the following manner:
The
crucial element is not whether a sector is specifically enumerated, but
whether a particular organization complies with the requirements of the
Constitution and RA 7941.
The resolution of petitions
for accreditation in the party-list system on a case-to-case basis not
tethered to the enumeration of the Constitution and of RA 7941 invites
the exercise of unbridled discretion. Unless firmly anchored on the
fundamental law and the implementing statute, the party-list system
will be a ship floating aimlessly in the ocean of uncertainty, easily
tossed by sudden waves of flux and tipped by shifting winds of change
in societal attitudes towards certain groups. Surely, the Constitution
and RA 7941 did not envision such kind of a system.
Indeed, the
significance of the enumeration in Section 5(2), Article VI of the
Constitution and Section 5 of RA 7941 is clearly explained in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party
:
"Proportional
representation" here does not refer to the number of people in a
particular district, because the party-list election is national in
scope. Neither does it allude to numerical strength in a distressed or
oppressed group. Rather, 
it refers to the representation of the
"marginalized and underrepresented" as exemplified by the enumeration
in Section 5 of the law
; namely, "labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban
poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women,
youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals."
However,
it is not enough for the candidate to claim representation of the
marginalized and underrepresented, because representation is easy to
claim and to feign
. The party-list organization or party must factually and truly represent the marginalized and underrepresented constituencies 
mentioned in Section 5
.
Concurrently, the persons nominated by the party-list
candidate-organization must be "Filipino citizens belonging to
marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties."

It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that words
employed in a statute are interpreted in connection with, and their
meaning is ascertained by reference to, the words and the phrases with
which they are associated or related. Thus, 
the meaning of a term in a statute may be limited, qualified or specialized by those in immediate association
.
[20]
 (emphasis and underscoring supplied)
More
importantly, in defining the concept of a "sectoral party," Section
3(d) of RA 7941 limits "marginalized and underrepresented sectors" and
expressly refers to the list in Section 5 thereof:
Section 3. 
Definition of Terms
. -- x x x
(d)    A sectoral party refers to an organized group of citizens 
belonging to any of the sectors enumerated in Section 5 hereof
 whose principal advocacy pertains to the special interest and concerns of their sector, x x x. (emphasis supplied)
Petitioner
does not question the constitutionality of Sections 2, 3(d) and 5 of RA
7941. (Its charges of violation of non-establishment of religion, equal
protection, free speech and free association are all leveled at the
assailed resolutions of the Commission on Elections.) Thus, petitioner
admits and accepts that its case must rise or fall based on the
aforementioned provisions of RA 7941.
Following the texts of the
Constitution and of RA 7941, and in accordance with established rules
of statutory construction and the Court's pronouncement in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party
, the meaning of "marginalized sectors" under the party list system is 
limited and qualified
. Hence, other sectors that may qualify as marginalized and underrepresented should have a 
close connection

to the sectors mentioned in the Constitution and in the law. In other
words, the marginalized and underrepresented sectors qualified to
participate in the party-list system refer only to the labor, peasant,
fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly,
handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, professionals and
 other related or similar sectors
.
This
interpretation is faithful to and deeply rooted in the language of the
fundamental law and of its implementing statute. It is coherent with
the mandate of the Constitution that marginalized sectors qualified to
participate in the party-list system but not mentioned in Section 5(2),
Article VI are 
"such other sectors as may be provided by law" duly enacted by Congress
. It is also consistent with the basic canon of statutory construction, 
ejusdem generis
,
which requires that a general word or phrase that follows an
enumeration of particular and specific words of the same class, the
general word or phrase should be construed to include, or to be
restricted to persons, things or cases, akin to, resembling, or of the
same kind or class as those specifically mentioned.
[21]

Moreover, it reins in the subjective elements of passion and prejudice
that accompany discussions of issues with moral or religious
implications as it avoids the need for complex balancing and undue
policy-making.
What is the unifying thread that runs through the
marginalized and underrepresented sectors under the party-list system?
What are the family resemblances that would characterize them?
[22]
Based on the language of the Constitution and of RA 7941 and considering the pronouncements of this Court in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party 
and 
BANAT
, the following factors are significant:
(a)  they must be among, or closely connected with or similar to, the sectors mentioned in Section 5 of RA 7941;
(b)
they must be sectors whose interests are traditionally and historically
regarded as vital to the national interest but they have long been
relegated to the fringes of society and deprived of an opportunity to
participate in the formulation of national policy;
(c) the
vinculum that will establish the close connection with or similarity of
sectors to those expressly mentioned in Section 5 of RA 7941 is a
constitutional provision specifically recognizing the special
significance of the said sectors (other than people's organizations,
unless such people's organizations represent sectors mentioned in
Section 5 of RA 7941)
[23]
 to the advancement of the national interest
 
and
(d)
while lacking in well-defined political constituencies, they must have
regional or national presence to ensure that their interests and agenda
will be beneficial not only to their respective sectors but, more
importantly, to the nation as a whole.
FOR PURPOSES OF THE PARTY-LIST SYSTEM,
PETITIONER IS NOT A MARGINALIZED SECTOR
In
this case, petitioner asserts that it is entitled to accreditation as a
marginalized and underrepresented sector under the party-list system.
However, the Commission on Elections disagrees.
The majority
reverses the Commission on Elections. While it focuses on the
contentious issues of morality, religion, equal protection, and freedom
of expression and association, by granting the petition, the majority
effectively rules that petitioner is a qualified marginalized and
underrepresented sector, thereby allowing its accreditation and
participation in the party-list system.
I disagree.
Even
assuming that petitioner was able to show that the community of
lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT) is underrepresented,
it cannot be properly considered as marginalized under the party-list
system. 
First
, petitioner is not included in the sectors
mentioned in Section 5(2), Article VI of the Constitution and Section 5
of RA 7941. Unless an overly strained interpretation is resorted to,
the LGBT sector cannot establish a close connection to any of the said
sectors. Indeed, petitioner does not even try to show its link to any
of the said sectors. Rather, it represents itself as an altogether
distinct sector with its own peculiar interests and agenda.
Second
,
petitioner's interest as a sector, which is basically the legal
recognition of its members' sexual orientation as a right, cannot be
reasonably considered as an interest that is traditionally and
historically considered as vital to national interest. At best,
petitioner may cite an emergent awareness of the implications of sexual
orientation on the national human rights agenda. However, an emergent
awareness is but a confirmation of lack of traditional and historical
recognition.
[24]
  Moreover, even the majority admits that there is 
no
 "clear cut consensus favorable to gay rights claims."
[25]
Third
,
petitioner is cut off from the common constitutional thread that runs
through the marginalized and underrepresented sectors under the
party-list system. It lacks the vinculum, a constitutional bond, a
provision in the fundamental law that specifically recognizes the LGBT
sector as specially significant to the national interest. This
standard, implied in 
BANAT
, is required to create the necessary
link of a particular sector to those sectors expressly mentioned in
Section 5(2), Article VI of the Constitution and Section 5 of RA 7941.
Finally
,
considering our history and tradition as a people, to consider the
promotion of the LGBT agenda and "gay rights" as a national policy as
beneficial to the nation as a whole is debatable at best. Even the
majority (aside from extensively invoking foreign practice and
international conventions rather than Philippine laws) states:
We
do not suggest that public opinion, even at its most liberal, reflect a
clear cut strong consensus favorable to gay rights claims....
[26]
This
is so unlike the significance of the interests of the sectors in
Section 5 of RA 7941 which are, without doubt, indisputable.
Regardless
of the personal beliefs and biases of its individual members, this
Court can only apply and interpret the Constitution and the laws. Its
power is not to create policy but to recognize, review or reverse the
policy crafted by the political departments if and when a proper case
is brought before it. Otherwise, it will tread on the dangerous grounds
of judicial legislation.
In this instance, Congress, in the
exercise of its authority under Section 5(2), Article VI of the
Constitution, enacted RA 7941. Sections 2, 3(d) and (5) of the said law
instituted a policy when it enumerated certain sectors as qualified
marginalized and underrepresented sectors under the party-list system.
Respect for that policy and fidelity to the Court's duty in our scheme
of government require us to declare that only sectors expressly
mentioned or closely related to those sectors mentioned in Section 5 of
RA 7941 are qualified to participate in the party-list system. That is
the tenor of the Court's rulings in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party 
and 
BANAT
. As there is no strong reason for the Court to rule otherwise, 
stare decisis
 compels a similar conclusion in this case.
The
Court is called upon to exercise judicial restraint in this case by
strictly adhering to, rather than expanding, legislative policy on the
matter of marginalized sectors as expressed in the enumeration in
Section 5 of RA 7941. The Court has no power to amend and expand
Sections 2, 3(d) and 5 of RA 7941 in the guise of interpretation. The
Constitution expressly and exclusively vests the authority to determine
"such other [marginalized] sectors" qualified to participate in the
party-list system to Congress. Thus, until and unless Congress amends
the law to include the LGBT and other sectors in the party-list system,
deference to Congress' determination on the matter is proper.
A FINAL WORD
To
be succinctly clear about it, I do not say that there is no truth to
petitioner's claim of discriminatory and oppressive acts against its
members. I am in no position to make that claim. Nor do I claim that
petitioner has no right to speak, to assemble or to access our
political departments, particularly the legislature, to promote the
interests of its constituency. Social perceptions of sexual and other
moral issues may change over time, and every group has the right to
persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best.
[27]

But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing and insisting on a
right to participate in the party-list system is something else.
Considering the facts, the law and jurisprudence, petitioner cannot
properly insist on its entitlement to use the party-list system as a
vehicle for advancing its social and political agenda.
While
bigotry, social stereotyping and other forms of discrimination must be
given no place in a truly just, democratic and libertarian society, the
party-list system has a well-defined purpose. The party-list system was
not designed as a tool to advocate tolerance and acceptance of any and
all socially misunderstood sectors. Rather, it is a platform for the
realization of the aspirations of marginalized sectors whose interests
are, by nature and history, also the nation's but which interests have
not been sufficiently brought to public attention because of these
sectors' underrepresentation.
Congress was given by the
Constitution full discretion to determine what sectors may qualify as
marginalized and underrepresented. The Court's task is to respect that
legislative determination by strictly adhering to it. If we effectively
and unduly expand such congressional determination, we will be dabbling
in policy-making, an act of political will and not of judicial judgment.
Accordingly, I respectfully vote to dismiss the petition.

 The notion of family resemblances (
familienÃ¤hnlichkeit
)
was introduced by the leading analytic philosopher, Ludwig
Wittgenstein, in his book Philosophical Investigations. As used in this
opinion, however, family resemblances specifically refer to the DNA,
the basic component unit, that identifies a sector as a member of the
family of marginalized and underrepresented sectors enumerated in
Section 5(2), Article VI of the Constitution and Section 5 of RA 7941.
[23]

The reason behind this exception is obvious. If all people's
organizations are automatically considered as marginalized and
underrepresented, then no sector or organization may be disqualified on
the grounds of non-marginalization and lack of underrepresentation. The
Court's guidelines in 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party
 would
have been unnecessary after all and, worse, the constitutional
requirement that the sectors qualified to participate in the party-list
system be determined by law would have been merely superfluous and
pointless.

SEPARATE OPINION
ABAD, 
J
.: 
I have to concur only in the result set forth in the well-written 
ponencia 
of Justice Mariano C. Del Castillo because I arrived at the same conclusion following a different path.
I also felt that the Court needs, in resolving the issues in this case, to say more about what the Constitution and Republic Act (R.A.) 7941 intends in the case of the party-list system to abate the aggravations and confusion caused by the alarming overnight proliferation of sectoral parties.
The underlying policy of R.A. 7941 or The Party-List System Act is to give the marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society an opportunity to take a direct part in enacting the laws of the land.  In 
Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections (COMELEC)
,
[1]
 
the Court laid down guidelines for accreditation, but these seem to leave the COMELEC like everyone else even more perplexed and dumbfounded about what organizations, clubs, or associations can pass for sectoral parties with a right to claim a seat in the House of Representatives.  The Court can, in adjudicating this case, unravel some of the difficulties.
Here, I fully agree that the COMELEC erred when it denied 
Ang Ladlad
's petition for sectoral party accreditation on religious and moral grounds.  The COMELEC has never applied these tests on regular candidates for Congress.  There is no reason for it to apply them on 
Ang Ladlad
.  But the 
ponencia
 already amply and lucidly discussed this point.
What I am more concerned about is COMELEC's claim in its comment on the petition that the 
Ang Ladlad
 sectoral party was not marginalized and underrepresented since it is not among, or even associated with, the sectors specified in the Constitution and in R.A. 7941.
[2]
 
Ang Ladlad
, it claims, did not qualify as a marginalized and underrepresented group of people like those representing labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, elderly, handicapped, women, youth, veterans, overseas workers, and professionals.  This is effectively the COMELEC's frame of mind in adjudicating applications for accreditation.
But, the COMELEC's proposition imposes an unwarranted restriction which is inconsistent with the purpose and spirit of the Constitution and the law.   A reading of 
Ang Bagong Bayani 
will show that, based on the Court's reading, neither the Constitution nor R.A. 7941 intends the excessively limited coverage that the COMELEC now suggests.   In fact, the Court said in that case that the list in R.A. 7941 is not exclusive.   Thus, while the party-list system is not meant for all sectors of society, it was envisioned as a social justice tool for the marginalized and underrepresented in general.
As it happened, the only clue that the Constitution provides respecting the identity of the sectors that will make up the party-list system is found in the examples it gives, namely, the labor, the peasant, the urban poor, the indigenous cultural minorities, the women, and the youth segments of society.  Section 5(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution provides:
(2) The party-list representative shall constitute twenty per centum of the total number of representatives including those under the party list.  For three consecutive terms after the ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or election from the 
labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, women, youth
, and 
such other sectors as may be provided by law, except the religious sector.
"  
(Underscoring supplied.)
Getting its bearing from the examples given above, the Congress provided in Section 2 of R.A. 7941 a broad standard for screening and identifying those who may qualify for the party-list system.  Thus:
 Sec. 2. Declaration of policy.  The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which 
will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation
 that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives.  Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.  
(Underscoring supplied.)
The above speaks of "marginalized and underrepresented sectoral parties or organizations x x x lack well defined political constituencies x x x who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation."  But, as the Court said in 
Ang Bagong Bayani
, the whole thing boils down to ascertaining whether the party seeking accreditation belongs to the "marginalized and underrepresented."
[3]
Unfortunately, Congress did not provide a definition of the term "marginalized and underrepresented."  Nor did the Court dare provide one in its decision in 
Ang Bagong Bayani
.  It is possible, however, to get a sense of what Congress intended in adopting such term.  No doubt, Congress crafted that term--marginalized and underrepresented--from its reading of the concrete examples that the Constitution itself gives of groupings that are entitled to accreditation.  These examples are the labor, the peasant, the urban poor, the indigenous cultural minorities, the women, and the youth sectors.  Fortunately, quite often ideas are best described by examples of what they are, which was what those who drafted the 1987 Constitution did, rather than by an abstract description of them.
For Congress it was much like looking at a gathering of "a dog, a cat, a horse, an elephant, and a tiger" and concluding that it is a gathering of "animals."  Here, it looked at the samples of qualified groups (labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural minorities, women, and youth) and found a common thread that passes through them all.  Congress concluded that these groups belonged to the "marginalized and underrepresented."
So what is the meaning of the term "marginalized and underrepresented?"  The examples given (labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural minorities, women, and youth) should be the starting point in any search for definition.  Congress has added six others to this list: the fisherfolk, the elderly, the handicapped, the veterans, the overseas workers, and the professionals.
[4]
  Thus, the pertinent portion of Section 5 of R.A. 7941 provides:
Sec. 5. Registration. - x x x Provided, that the sector shall include labor, peasant, 
fisherfolk
, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, 
elderly
, 
handicapped
, women, youth, 
veterans
, overseas workers, and 
professionals.
If one were to analyze these Constitutional and statutory examples of qualified parties, it should be evident that they represent the 
working class
 (labor, peasant, fisherfolk, overseas workers), the 
service class
 (professionals), the 
economically deprived
 (urban poor), the 
social outcasts
 (indigenous cultural minorities), the 
vulnerable
 (women, youth) and the 
work impaired
 (elderly, handicapped, veterans).  This analysis provides some understanding of who, in the eyes of Congress, are marginalized and underrepresented.
The parties of the marginalized and underrepresented should be more than just lobby or interest groups.   They must have an authentic identity that goes beyond mere similarities in background or circumstances.   It is not enough that their members belong to the same industry, speak the same dialect, have a common hobby or sport, or wish to promote public support for their mutual interests.  The group should be characterized by a shared advocacy for genuine issues affecting basic human rights as these apply to their groups.  This is in keeping with the statutory objective of sharing with them seats in the House of Representatives so they can take part in enacting beneficial legislation.
It should be borne in mind, however, that both the Constitution and R.A. 7941 merely provide by examples a sense of what the qualified organizations should look like.  As the Court acknowledged in 
Ang Bagong Bayani
, these examples are not exclusive.  For instance, there are groups which are pushed to the margin because they advocate an extremist political ideology, such as the extreme right and the extreme left of the political divide.  They may be regarded, if the evidence warrants, as qualified sectors.
Further, to qualify, a party applying for accreditation must represent a narrow rather than a specific definition of the class of people they seek to represent.  For example, the Constitution uses the term "labor," a narrower definition than the broad and more abstract term, "working class," without slipping down to the more specific and concrete definition like "carpenters," "security guards," "microchips factory workers," "barbers," "tricycle drivers," and similar sub-groupings in the "labor" group.  See the other illustrations below.

*The definition that the Constitution and R.A. 7941 use by their examples.
Obviously, the level of representation desired by both the Constitution and R.A. 7941 for the party-list system is the second, the narrow definition of the sector that the law regards as "marginalized and underrepresented."  The implication of this is that, if any of the sub-groupings (the carpenters, the security guards, the microchips factory workers, the barbers, the tricycle drivers in the example) within the sector desires to apply for accreditation as a party-list group, it must compete with other sub-groups for the seat allotted to the "labor sector" in the House of Representatives.  This is the apparent intent of the Constitution and the law.
An interpretation that will allow concretely or specifically defined groups to seek election as a separate party-list sector by itself will result in riot and redundancy in the mix of sectoral parties grabbing seats in the House of Representatives.  It will defeat altogether the objectives of the party-list system.  If they can muster enough votes, the country may have a party-list of pedicab drivers and another of tricycle drivers.  There will be an irrational apportionment of party-list seats in the legislature.
In addition, Section 5 of R.A. 7941 provides that parties interested in taking part in the party-list system must state if they are to be considered as national, regional, or sectoral parties. Thus:
Sec. 5. Registration. - Any organized group of persons may register as a party, organization or coalition for purposes of the party-list system by filing with the COMELEC not later than ninety (90) days before the election a petition verified by its president or secretary stating its desire to participate in the party-list system as a 
national, regional or sectoral
 party or organization or a coalition of such parties or organizations, x x x. 
This provision, taken alongside with the territorial character of the sample sectors provided by the Constitution and R.A. 7941, indicates that every sectoral party-list applicant must have an inherently 
regional presence
 (indigenous cultural minorities) or a 
national presence
 (all the rest).
The people they represent are not bound up by the territorial borders of provinces, cities, or municipalities.  A sectoral group representing the sugar plantation workers of Negros Occidental, for example, will not qualify because it does not represent the inherently national character of the labor sector.
Finally, as the Court held in 
Ang Bagong Bayani
, it is not enough for a party to claim that it represents the marginalized and underrepresented.  That is easy to do.  The party must factually and truly represent the marginalized and underrepresented. It must present to the COMELEC clear and convincing evidence of its history, authenticity, advocacy, and magnitude of presence.  The COMELEC must reject those who put up building props overnight as in the movies to create an illusion of sectoral presence so they can get through the door of Congress without running for a seat in a regular legislative district.
In sum, to qualify for accreditation:
One
, the applying party must show that it represents the "marginalized and underrepresented," exemplified by the working class, the service class, the economically deprived, the social outcasts, the vulnerable, the work impaired, or some such similar class of persons.
Two
, the applying party should be characterized by a shared advocacy for genuine issues affecting basic human rights as these apply to the sector it represents.
Three
, the applying party must share the cause of their sector, narrowly defined as shown above.  If such party is a sub-group within that sector, it must compete with other sub-groups for the seat allocated to their sector.
Four
, the members of the party seeking accreditation must have an inherent regional or national presence.
And 
five
, except for matters the COMELEC can take judicial notice of, the party applying for accreditation must prove its claims by clear and convincing evidence.
In this case, 
Ang Ladlad
 represents men and women who identify themselves as lesbians, gays, bisexuals, or trans-gendered persons (LGBTs).  Applying the universally accepted estimate that one out of every 10 persons is an LGBT of a certain kind,
[5]
  the Filipino LGBTs should now stand at about 8.7 million.  Despite this, however, they are by and large, subtly if not brutally, excluded from the mainstream, discriminated against, and persecuted.  That the COMELEC denied 
Ang Ladlad
's petition on religious and moral grounds is proof of this discrimination.
Ang Ladlad
 claims that many cases of intolerance and violence against LGBTs have been documented.  At home, effeminate or gay youths are subjected to physical abuse by parents or guardians to make them conform to standard gender norms of behavior, while lesbian youths are raped to cure them of their perceived affliction.  LGBTs are refused admission from certain schools, or are suspended and put on probation.   Meanwhile, in the workplace, they are denied promotions or benefits which are otherwise available to heterosexuals holding the same positions. There is bigotry for their group.
Ang Ladlad
 has amply proved that it meets the requirements for sectoral party accreditation. Their members are in the vulnerable class like the women and the youth.  
Ang Ladlad
 represents a narrow definition of its class (LGBTs) rather than a concrete and specific definition of a sub-group within the class (group of gay beauticians, for example).  The people that 
Ang Ladlad
 seeks to represent have a national presence.
The lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and trans-gendered persons in our communities are our brothers, sisters, friends, or colleagues who have suffered in silence all these years.  True, the party-list system is not necessarily a tool for advocating tolerance or acceptance of their practices or beliefs.   But it does promise them, as a marginalized and underrepresented group, the chance to have a direct involvement in crafting legislations that impact on their lives and existence.  It is an opportunity for true and effective representation which is the very essence of our party-list system.
For
 
the above reasons, I vote to 
GRANT 
the petition.
