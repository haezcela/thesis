LUMINZA DELOS REYES, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE DANILO S. CRUZ AND AND CLERK OF COURT V GODOLFO R. GUNDRAN, OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 152, PASIG CITY, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




DEL CASTILLO, J.:


Courts exist to administer justice fairly and without delay.  Our overriding concern is to eradicate the impression formed in the minds of the litigants that the wheels of justice grind ever so slowly. We have always reminded the judges to dispose of the cases within the prescribed period of time because we do not want the truism - justice delayed is justice denied - to lose its meaning or relevance.  In the same context, we have constantly exhorted all court employees to be conscientious of their duties and responsibilities considering that any indiscretion or transgression on their part would impact negatively on the Court as an institution.
The instant administrative case stemmed from a letter-complaint filed by complainant Luminza Delos Reyes (Delos Reyes) against respondents Judge Danilo S. Cruz  (Judge Cruz) and Clerk of Court V Godolfo R. Gundran (Clerk of Court Gundran), both of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 152, for dereliction of duty. Specifically, Judge Cruz is charged with delay in the disposition of LRC Case No. R-5740
[1]
 while Clerk of Court Gundran is charged with failure to timely transmit the records of said case.
In her letter-complaint dated March 13, 2008, complainant alleged that she is the defendant in LRC Case No. R-5740 pending before Branch 152 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City.  She claimed that on March 25, 2004, Judge Cruz issued an Order giving the parties 15 days within which to file their respective memorandum after which the case would be deemed submitted for decision.  The parties complied; hence, on April 9, 2004 the case was deemed submitted for decision.
However, it was only on July 30, 2007, or more than three years since the case was submitted for resolution, that a decision in the said case was rendered.  Consequently, complainant argued that Judge Cruz incurred delay in disposing the case thus should be held administratively liable therefor.
Complainant also alleged that after receipt of the adverse decision, she timely filed on September 6, 2007 a notice of appeal and paid the corresponding appeal and docket fees. However, despite the lapse of more than six months from the time the appeal was filed, respondent Clerk of Court Gundran still failed to transmit the records to the appellate court in violation of Section 10, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.
On April 11, 2008, then Court Administrator Zenaida N. ElepaÃ±o required Judge Cruz and Clerk of Court Gundran to file their respective comment on the complaint. Both respondents complied.
In his Comment, Judge Cruz did not deny that he incurred delay in the disposition of LRC Case No. R-5740.  Instead, he begged the indulgence of the Court and claimed that he was indisposed since the latter part of 2004.  He narrated that in January 2005, he was diagnosed of diabetes; on November 3, 2005, the cataract on his left eye was removed while that on his right eye was extracted on April 4, 2006; and on October 26-28, 2007, he was hospitalized due to heart complications. Judge Cruz also explained that the delay was partly due to heavy pressure of work.
On the other hand, Clerk of Court Gundran denied being remiss in his duties. He claimed that in October 2007, he already instructed the clerk-in-charge to complete the records of the case and to prepare the transmittal letter.  Apparently, the clerk-in-charge encountered some difficulty in completing the records.  He signed the transmittal letter on February 28, 2008 only to discover that Judge Cruz has not yet issued an order giving due course to the appeal.  The records were eventually transmitted on March 28, 2008, or on the same day the order giving due course to the appeal was issued by Judge Cruz.  Clerk of Court Gundran also claimed that he found it difficult to personally examine if the records have been completed and transmitted on time due to the heavy court docket and the numerous reports that needed to be prepared and submitted.  Finally, he insisted that there was no deliberate intention to delay the transmittal of the records or to cause damage to the complainant.
In its Report and Recommendation dated October 13, 2008, the Office of the Court Administrator stated that:
EVALUATION
:  Evidently, there were two delays incurred in this case.  First is the delay in deciding the subject case and the second is the delay in the transmittal of the record of the case to the Court of Appeals.
The delay in deciding the case is attributable solely to Judge Cruz.  While we do not condone such delay, we are inclined to consider in the instant matter his physical condition the deterioration of which is supported by several medical certificates and hospital records.  He even availed of the Health and Welfare Plan of the Supreme Court.
The case of respondent Gundran, should, however, be treated differently.  As Branch Clerk, it is his duty to verify the completeness of the records that will be transmitted to the appellate court within thirty (30) days after perfection of the appeal.  He cannot transfer the blame to his staff.  Had he followed up his verbal instruction, if there was any, he would not have incurred the delay.

RECOMMENDATION
:  Respectfully submitted for the consideration of the Honorable Court are our recommendations that:
this case be RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter;
the charges against Judge Danilo S. Cruz be DISMISSED with WARNING however that he should be cautious in observing periods for rendition of judgment; and
respondent Clerk of Court Godofredo Gundran be SUSPENDED for one (1) month and one (1) day for simple neglect of duty.
We find both respondents to be remiss in their duties.
As regards Judge Cruz, we find him grossly inefficient in failing to decide LRC Case No. R-5740 within 90 days from the time it was submitted for decision.  He should be mindful that failure to resolve cases submitted for decision within the period fixed by law constitutes a serious violation of the constitutional right of the parties to the speedy disposition of their cases.
[2]
  Article VIII, Section 15(1) of the Constitution succinctly provides that:
SEC. 15. (1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.
As such, lower courts are given a period of 90 days only within which to decide or resolve a case from the time it is submitted for decision.
[3]
 In this case, it is undisputed that LRC Case No. R-5740 was submitted for decision on April 9, 2004 but the decision was rendered only on July 30, 2007 or more than three years beyond the 90-day reglementary period.
The reasons proffered by Judge Cruz for incurring delay in deciding the case within the prescribed period fail to persuade us. He claims that his illness primarily caused the delay in the disposition.  However, it has not escaped our attention that the case was submitted for decision as early as April 2004 while Judge Cruz claimed to be indisposed only towards the end of 2004.  There was also no showing that respondent judge was constantly ill from the time the case was submitted for resolution in April 2004 until the promulgation of the judgment in July 2007.  He did not present any proof to show that he was absent from work for a prolonged period of time.  Moreover, removal of cataract from both eyes does not entail prolonged confinement. In fact, Judge Cruz claimed that he was admitted to the hospital only on October 26-28, 2007. At any rate, this confinement occurred long after the rendition of the judgment in LRC Case No. R-5740.
Besides, granting that his illness hindered the efficient performance of his functions, all respondent judge had to do was to request for an extension of time within which to decide the case.  Judge Cruz, however, made no such request.  In a similar case,
[4]
 we held that:
Indeed, Judge Ubiadas' illness could have adversely affected the performance of his duties.  Despite having just been subjected to a triple by-pass operation, he knew fully well that he still had to act as the judge of four (4) RTC branches for two (2) months.  If his illness had indeed seriously hampered him in the discharge of his duties, Judge Ubiadas could have requested this Court for additional time to decide/resolve pending cases and incidents.  His illness cannot be an excuse for his failure to render decisions or resolutions within the constitutionally prescribed period, considering that he could have requested an extension or other relief from this Court but he did not. It is incumbent upon him to dispose the cases assigned to him without undue delay.
This Court has incessantly admonished members of the bench to administer justice without undue delay, for justice delayed is justice denied.  The present clogged dockets in all levels of our judicial system cannot be cleared unless every magistrate earnestly, painstakingly and faithfully complies with the mandate of the law.  Undue delay in the disposition of cases amounts to a denial of justice which, in turn, brings the courts into disrepute and ultimately erodes the faith and confidence of the public in the judiciary.
[5]
We also find unacceptable Judge Cruz's justification that the delay was partly due to heavy pressure of work.  Precisely, a judge is mandated to resolve cases with dispatch. Section 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct
[6]
 categorically exhorts all judges to "perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness".  In 
Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the MTCC, Branch 2, Cagayan de Oro City
,
[7]
 we declared that:
We are not unmindful of the burden of heavy caseloads heaped on the shoulders of every trial judge.  But that cannot excuse them from doing their mandated duty to resolve cases with diligence and dispatch. Judges burdened with heavy caseloads should request the Court for an extension of the reglementary period within which to decide their cases if they think they cannot comply with their judicial duty.  Hence, under the circumstances, all that said judge needed to do was request for an extension of time since this Court has, almost invariably, been considerate with regard to such requests. x x x  A heavy caseload may excuse a judge's failure to decide cases within the reglementary period but not their failure to request an extension of time within which to decide the case on time.
We have always extended a sympathetic attitude towards judges. In fact, in recent years, we have exerted efforts towards improving their condition.  In return, we expect them to likewise exert efforts towards improving the image of the judiciary.  It must be emphasized that the "honor and integrity of the judicial system is measured not only by the fairness and correctness of decisions rendered, but also by the expediency with which disputes are resolved".
[8]
  At this juncture, we remind respondent judge that:
Delay in the disposition of cases not only deprives litigants of their right to speedy disposition of their cases, but also tarnishes the image of the judiciary. Procrastination among members of the judiciary in rendering decisions and taking appropriate actions on the cases before them not only causes great injustice to the parties involved but also invites suspicion of ulterior motives on the part of the judge, in addition to the fact that it erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary, lowers its standards and brings it into disrepute.
[9]
As regards respondent Clerk of Court Gundran, we find him guilty of simple neglect of duty for failure to timely transmit the records of LRC Case No. R-5740.  Section 10, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides that:
SEC. 10. 
Duty of clerk of court of the lower court upon perfection of appeal. 
- Within thirty (30) days after perfection of all the appeals in accordance with the preceding section, it shall be the duty of the clerk of court of the lower court:
(a)  To verify the correctness of the original records or the record on appeal, as the case may be, and to make a certification of its correctness;
(b)  To verify the completeness of the records that will be transmitted to the appellate court;
(c)  If found to be incomplete, to take such measures as may be required to complete the records, availing of the authority that he or the court may exercise for this purpose; and
(d) To transmit the records to the appellate court.
If the efforts to complete the records fail, he shall indicate in his letter of transmittal the exhibits or transcripts not included in the records being transmitted to the appellate court, the reasons for their non-transmittal, and the steps taken or that could be taken to have them available.
The clerk of court shall furnish the parties with copies of his letter of transmittal of the records [to] the appellate court.
Verily, the duty to verify the correctness and completeness of the records of the case rests with the respondent.  However, in this case, respondent Clerk of Court Gundran relegated the performance of his job to another court employee without any justifiable reason.  We are likewise not persuaded by his contention that the transmittal was delayed because the clerk-in-charge to whom he assigned the job encountered some difficulty in completing the records.  Section 10, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court expressly provides that if the records are found to be incomplete, measures should be taken to complete the records.  In his comment, however, Clerk of Court Gundran made no mention of any steps taken to complete the records.  At any rate, the failure to complete the records does not justify its non-transmittal.  Under the Rules, when the records cannot be completed, respondent should "indicate in his letter of transmittal the exhibits or transcripts not included in the records being transmitted to the appellate court, the reasons for their non-transmittal, and the steps taken or that could be taken to have them available".
[10]
 Finally, it has not escaped our notice that the records were eventually transmitted only on March 28, 2008 or more than six months after complainant filed her appeal, or about two weeks after the instant administrative complaint was filed.
We stress that clerks of court are essential judicial officers who perform delicate administrative functions vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice. Their duty is, 
inter alia, 
to assist in the management of the calendar of the court and in all matters that do not involve discretion or judgment properly belonging to the judge.  They play a key role in the complement of the court, as their office is the hub of adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and concerns.  As such, they are required to be persons of competence, honesty and probity, they cannot be permitted to slacken on their jobs.
[11]
Section 9, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court classifies undue delay in rendering a decision or order as a less serious charge punishable by either (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one nor more than three months; or (b) a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.
[12]
 In the instant case, there was undue delay of more than three years before the decision in LRC Case No. R-5740 was rendered.  We therefore find the penalty of fine of P11,000.00 as appropriate under the circumstances.
On the other hand, Section 22, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations classifies simple neglect of duty as a less grave offense punishable by suspension of one month and one day to six months, if committed for the first time, and by dismissal if committed for the second time.  As such, we find the penalty of suspension of two months as appropriate under the circumstances.
WHEREFORE
, we find Judge Danilo S. Cruz of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 152, 
GUILTY
 of undue delay in rendering a decision in LRC Case No. R-5740 and is hereby 
FINED
 the amount of P11,000.00.  Likewise, Clerk of Court V Godolfo R. Gundran of the same court is also 
GUILTY
 of simple neglect of duty and is hereby meted the penalty of suspension of two months without salary and benefits.  Both are 
STERNLY WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.
