Davis, likewise, asked for the deletion of the positions for Chief Judicial Staff Officer and Human Resource Management Officer V, which have been converted to the Project Development Officer V and Human Resource Management Officer III positions, respectively, from the PMO's 
plantilla
.
By way of reply, Atty. Candelaria, in a Memorandum
[3]
 dated January 5, 2010, argued that:
It is observed that the request of Mr. Davis for the amendment of the education and eligibility requirements of the position of Project Development Officer V would only confine the selection of applicants to licensed civil engineers although the education[al] requirement is "post graduate degree in [civil] engineering, public administration, business administration, social sciences or related fields." The eligibility requirement will not jibe with the recommendation of R.A. 1080 (Licensed Civil Engineer) if one is not a post graduate or with (sic) a masteral degree in Civil Engineering.
Thus, she recommends that the educational requirement be changed to "graduate of Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering, with post graduate degree in Civil Engineering."
The PMO's recommendations are meritorious. We approve its recommendations for the QS for the positions of Project Development Officer V and Human Resource Management Officer III.
First, on the QS for Project Development Officer V.
Atty. Candelaria misconstrues the import of the amendment introduced by the PMO. The requirement of a postgraduate degree in Civil Engineering, Public Administration, and other related courses is not in conflict with the requirement of being a licensed civil engineer.
To be a licensed civil engineer, one has to be a "graduate of a four-year course in civil engineering from a school, college or university recognized by the Government or the State wherein it is established."
[4]
 Necessarily, therefore, a duly licensed civil engineer must have obtained a 
bachelor's degree
 in civil engineering.
However, a licensed civil engineer who opts for further studies may take courses in fields other than civil engineering.
Nowadays, a variety of postgraduate courses is being offered in schools. Professionals often take courses that they believe will help them advance their careers. Engineers may decide to take postgraduate courses not only in engineering, but also in Business, Finance, Economics, Information Technology, and related fields. A civil engineer working for the government may decide to pursue a master's degree in Public Administration. Postgraduate degrees in other disciplines do not, in any way, affect compliance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1080, since a postgraduate degree is not a requirement for a licensed civil engineer.
The OAS' recommendation is also unduly limiting. For example, a licensed civil engineer who has obtained a Master in Business Administration degree, or a government civil engineer who has a master's degree in pubic management, would be barred from applying for the position.
If the objective of setting the QS is for the Court to find the best possible person for the job, then unduly limiting the QS would not be in the Court's best interest.
As to the QS and job description for Human Resource Management Officer III, we note that the OAS has recommended the approval of the PMO's proposal, 
in toto
