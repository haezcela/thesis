In its own Manifestation and Compliance,
[5]
 petitioner confirms the parties' amicable settlement through the Compromise Agreement and professes that it interposes no objection to respondents' prayer for dismissal of the petition. Petitioner also submits, aside from a copy of the Compromise Agreement, a Joint Release, Waiver and Quitclaim
[6]
 dated June 16, 2010, where the respondents acknowledged receipt of the amounts indicated in the Compromise Agreement as complete settlement of all their claims against petitioner, relative to this case, and in consideration of which they--
1. x x x remise, release and forever discharge the Company, its successors-in-interest, stockholders, officers, directors, agents or employees from any action, sum of money, damages, claims and demands whatsoever, which in law or in equity [they] ever had, now have, or which [they, their] successors and assigns hereafter may have by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, up to the time of these presents, the intention hereof being completely and absolutely to release the Company as well as its successors-in-interest, stockholders, officers, directors, agents or employees from all liabilities arising wholly, partially or directly from our temporary assignment/engagement with the Company.
2. x x x acknowledge the temporary nature of [their] assignment/engagement with the Company and the absence of an employer-employee relationship between [them] and the Company, and [they] further acknowledge that [they] have no intention whatsoever of being reinstated to [their] previous assignment at the Company.
3. x x x also manifest that the payment by the Company of any or all of the foregoing sum of money shall not be taken by [them, their] heirs or assigns as a confession and/or admission of liability on the part of the Company, as well as its successors-in-interest, stockholders, officers, directors, agents or employees for any matter, cause, demand or claim that [they] may have against any or all of them.  [They] acknowledge that [they] have received all amounts that are now, or in the future, may be due [them] from the Company.  [They] also acknowledge that during the entire period of [their] temporary assignment/engagement with the Company, [they] received and were paid all compensations, benefits and privileges to which [they] were entitled under the law, and if [they] are hereinafter be found in any manner to have been entitled to any amount, the above consideration is a full and complete satisfaction of any and all such undisclosed claims.
4. x x x warrant that [they] will institute no action and will not continue to prosecute any pending action, against the Company, as well as its successors-in-interest, stockholders, officers, directors, agents or employees, by reason of [their] temporary assignment/engagement with the Company, including the case docketed as G.R. No. 190381 pending before the Supreme Court.
5. x x x finally declare that [they] have read and fully understand this document, and the release, waiver and quitclaim hereby given is made willingly and voluntarily and with full knowledge of [their] rights under the law.
[7]
The Joint Release, Waiver and Quitclaim was signed individually by respondents and their counsel of record.
Under the Civil Code of the Philippines,
[8]
 contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms, and conditions, as they deem convenient, so long as they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.  A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties undertake reciprocal obligations to resolve their differences in order to avoid litigation or put an end to one already instituted.
[9]
  It is a judicial covenant having the force and effect of a judgment, subject to execution in accordance with the Rules of Court, and having the effect and authority of 
res judicata
 upon its approval by the court where the litigation is pending.
[10]
Finding the Compromise Agreement dated June 16, 2010 between petitioner and respondents to be validly executed, not being contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy, we, therefore, accept and affirm the same.
WHEREFORE
, the Manifestation and Motion of respondents Rodrigo Mercado, et al. is 
GRANTED. 
The Compromise Agreement dated June 16, 2010 between petitioner Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. and respondents Rodrigo Mercado, et al. is 
AFFIRMED,
 and judgment is rendered accordingly.  The instant controversy is 
DISMISSED.
  No costs.
