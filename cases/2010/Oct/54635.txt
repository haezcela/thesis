In her March 7, 2007 explanation,
[13]
 respondent stated:
x x x x
With much apologies, the undersigned is very sorry for the problem of shortages and lost receipts. However, she is not to be blamed in the incident because the same were 
brought about by the flood caused by numerous typhoons that devastated their province in the year 1998 and 2004;
To prove and clear all her accountabilities, the undersigned 
will be presenting documents
, records and 
other evidence to give light to the shortages
.  However, if the same does not satisfactorily cover the whole amount of P325,900.00 for Fiduciary Fund and P1,000.00 for Sheriff Trust Fund/Process Server's Fee, she will pay the remaining shortages;
As to the original copies of the three (3) booklets of unaccounted Official Receipts, undersigned failed to retrieve all the receipts, after the same were destroyed by flood caused by typhoon.  However, she will be presenting all the receipts she had successfully retrieved and 
will present certifications from those who posted cashbonds that they had released and released the same

The OCA, by Memorandum of August 22, 2007,
[14]
 thereupon evaluated the complaint as follows:
x x x x
Based on the Report dated November 14, 2006, of the OCA Audit Team, respondent Santos' summary of accountabilities is as follows:
 
 
 
General Fund 
 
 
P 
 
 
3.00 
 
 
 
 
Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF) 
 
 
 
 
19,424.00

325,900.00 
 
 
 
 
Total
 
 
 
P
 
 
 
382,758.20
 
 
 
The General Fund shortage was restituted by respondent on July 21, 2006.
The SAJF shortage of P19,424.00 was the result of respondent's 
failure to remit her collections
 from April 2005 to May 2006, 
in violation of
 Amended Administrative Circular No. 35-2005. The amount was 
restituted by respondent on July 17, 2006.
The JDF's shortage corresponds to respondent's collections of said account for the period November 2003 to March 2006.  Respondent 
restituted the amount on July 17, 2006.
The last entry in the Mediation Fund cashbook was for the month of November 2004 and the court's file of Monthly Reports of Collections and Deposit for the said fund was for October 2004 only.  Evidently, the financial records of the Mediation Fund was taken for granted in violation of A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA.  Respondent 
restituted the P9,750.00 shortage on July 17, 2006.
Only one process server's fee in the amount of P1,000.00 was collected by respondent based on the official receipt issued for the said account. The OR used by respondent was for the Mediation Fund Account.
The Fiduciary Fund shortage of P325,900.00 was also the result of respondent's 
failure to deposit her collections
 of said account 
in violation of Circular NO. 13-92
, which mandates the Clerks of Courts concerned to deposit, with an authorized government depositary bank, immediately or within 24 hours upon receipt of all collections from bail bonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections.  Respondent failed to comply with said directive despite the fact that the court's depositary bank is in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija which is less than an hour from the MTC, San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija.
The audit team also observed that 
the cash bonds for the following cases were 
withdrawn without the required supporting documents

:  SC OR Nos. I-7992001-799050, II-7992051-7992100 and IV-21701401-21701450.
Respondent's 
failure to regularly submit monthly reports of collections and deposits
 as mandated by SC Circular No. 32-93 prompted the Accounting Division, Financial Management Office, OCA to withhold her salaries.  Below is the list of respondent's unsubmitted reports:
 
 
 
For Fiduciary Fund 
 
 
May 2003 to June 2003; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
October 2003 to March 2006

November 2003 to March 2006 
 
 
Respondent requests for a recomputation of her accountabilities in view of the restitutions she made.  Notably, the total amount she had restituted has already been deducted from her total accountability.  Thus, 
only the shortages for the fiduciary fund and sheriff trust fund/process server's fee were ordered by the Court to be restituted
.  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)
The OCA concluded/RECOMMENDED:
In view of the foregoing, only 
a partial suspension of the Court's January 15, 2007 Resolution is in order
, i.e., particularly the directive to respondent Santos to restitute the amount of P325,900.00 and P1,000.00 representing her balance of accountability for Fiduciary Fund and Sheriff Trust Fund/Process Server's Fee, respectively; and, the directive to submit to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office (CMO), OCA, the original copies of the 3 booklets of unaccounted OR's.  This is in order to give respondent the final opportunity to produce and present her evidence.  In this connection, respondent Santos should be 
given ten (10) days from notice within which to 
present
 to the Fiscal Monitoring Division
, CMO, OCA 
all the documents, records and other evidence pertaining to her shortages and the 3 booklets of unaccounted OR's
. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Acting on the recommendation of the OCA, the Court, by 
Resolution of October 8, 2007
,
[15]
 resolved to:
REQUIRE
 respondent to 
MANIFEST 
to the Court whether she is willing to submit this matter for resolution on the basis of the pleadings filed within ten (10) days from notice;
DIRECT
 Mrs. Marcela V. Santos to 
PRODUCE
 and 
PRESENT
 before the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office (CMO), OCA, within ten (10) days from notice:  all the "documents, records and other evidence" pertaining to her shortages on the Fiduciary Fund and Sheriff Trust Fund/Process Server's Fee, as well as the evidence on the original copies of the three (3) booklets of unaccounted or missing Supreme Court Official Receipts;
DIRECT
 the Fiscal Monitoring Division, CMO, OCA to 
REPORT 
to the Court, with the necessary 
RECOMMENDATION
, on respondent Santos' presentation of evidence, stating clearly the resulting balance of her accountabilities on the Fiduciary Fund and Sheriff Trust Fund/Process Server's Fee, should there still be any, and her accountability on the missing official receipts, within fifteen (15) days after respondent Santos' presentation of evidence;
DIRECT
 Acting Collecting Officer Ms. Leonida A. Ladisla to:
 
 
(a)
 
WITHDRAW
 the interest earned on deposits of Fiduciary Fund in the total amount of P2,414.65, 
DEPOSIT
 the same to the account of the JDF, and 
SUBMIT
 to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office, OCA, the corresponding machine validated deposit slip, within ten (10) days from notice; and
 
 
 
(b)
 
STRICTLY COMPLY
 with all court circulars and issuances in the proper handling of Judiciary Funds; and
 
 
DIRECT
 Hon. Rixon M. Garong, Presiding Judge, to study and implement procedures that will strengthen the internal control over the cash transactions of the court.
[16]
  (emphasis in the original)
To date, the Court is not aware of the whereabouts of respondent who failed to comply with the Court's Resolution of October 8, 2007.
[17]
  She was last heard on March 7, 2007 when she filed her March 7, 2007 explanation,
[18]
 pertinent portions of which were quoted above.
Acting on the March 29, 2010
[19]
 Memorandum of the OCA, the Court, by Resolution of July 28, 2010,
[20]
 resolved to determine the liabilities of respondent on the basis of the records.
The Court finds that, indeed, respondent failed to 
regularly
 submit monthly reports of collections and deposits, as required by SC Circular No. 32-93, and official receipts and other documents, despite this Court's repeated orders.  In incurring shortage of accountabilities in the amount of P326,900, respondent is guilty of gross dishonesty and grave misconduct.
[N]o position demands greater moral righteousness and uprightness from the occupant than does the judicial office.  The safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly administration of justice, and protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds.  
The failure to remit the funds in due time amounts to dishonesty and grave misconduct
, which the Court cannot tolerate for they diminish the people's faith in the judiciary.  The act of misappropriating judiciary funds constitutes dishonest and grave misconduct which are punishable by dismissal from the service even if committed for the first time.
[21]
 (underscoring supplied)
It can never be overemphasized that a clerk of court, like respondent, is responsible for court records and physical facilities of the court and is accountable for the court's money and property deposits, following Section B, Chapter 1 of the 1991 Manual for Clerks of Court and 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court.
[22]
Under Section 23 of Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book V of Executive Order 292 and other pertinent Civil Service Laws, gross misconduct and dishonesty are both punishable by DISMISSAL from the service.
WHEREFORE
, respondent, Marcela V. Santos, Clerk of Court II, Municipal Trial Court of San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija, is declared 
GUILTY
 of Gross Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct. She is ordered 
DISMISSED
 from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, excluding accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any government office including government-owned and controlled corporations.
For failure to return the required documents despite repeated orders of the Court, respondent is likewise declared 
GUILTY
 of contempt of court.  She is ordered to pay a 
FINE
 of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000) and to submit all the required documents to the Office of the Court Administrator within thirty days from receipt of this Decision.
The Fiscal Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, is 
DIRECTED
 to process the terminal leave benefits of respondent with dispatch and apply the same to her accountabilities, giving priority to the Fiduciary Fund Account of the Municipal Trial Court of San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija.
Upon submission of the missing documents by respondent, the Fiscal Management Office is 
DIRECTED
 to compute the remaining accountabilities of respondent, if any, and to submit a report thereon within thirty days from compliance by respondent.
Respondent is further ordered to 
RESTITUTE
 the amount of Three Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Nine Hundred Pesos (P325,900) representing shortage in the Fiduciary Fund, and One Thousand Pesos (P1,000) representing shortage of the Sheriff Trust Fund/Process Server's Fee.
Finally, the Office of the Court Administrator is 
DIRECTED
 to initiate appropriate criminal proceedings against respondent in light of the above findings of the Court.
