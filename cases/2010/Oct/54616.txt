VELASCO JR., J.:


The Case
This is an appeal from the August 11, 2009 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 03338 entitled 
People of the Philippines v. Edward R. Feliciano, Anita G. Laurora, Editha C. Maglalang, May G. Estrella and Romelito G. Ruelo
 which affirmed the July 23, 2007 Decision
[2]
 of Branch 154 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City.  The RTC found accused-appellants Edward Feliciano and Anita Laurora guilty of violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, otherwise known as the 
Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
, in Criminal Case No. 14639-D. Further, in Criminal Case Nos. 14641-D to 14645-D, the RTC found accused-appellants Feliciano and Laurora, together with accused Editha Maglalang and Romelito Ruelo guilty of violation of Sec. 15 of RA 9165.
The Facts
In Criminal Case No. 14639-D, the charge against accused-appellants Feliciano and Laurora stemmed from the following Information:
On or about February 23, 2006 in Pasig City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, not being lawfully authorized by law, conspiring, confederating together, and both of them mutually helping and aiding one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver and give away to PO2 Badalf V. Monte, a police poseur buyer, one (1) pc. heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 0.03 gram of white crystalline substance, which was found positive to the test for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, in violation of the said law.
Contrary to law.
[3]
In Criminal Case Nos. 14641-D to 14645-D, the Informations read:
On or about February 23, 2006 in Pasig City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, not being lawfully authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly use, smoke and ingest into his body a methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, and that this is the first offense of the accused under Section 15 of the above-cited law, who after a confirmatory urine test, was found positive to the test for methamphetamine, a dangerous drug, in violation of the above-cited law.
Contrary to law.
[4]
On March 23, 2006, accused-appellants were arraigned, and they entered a plea of "not guilty" to the offense charged.
[5]
After the pre-trial conference, trial on the merits ensued.
During the trial, the prosecution presented as its witnesses Police Senior Inspector Marilyn Dequito, Police Officer 2 (PO2) Badalf Monte, PO2 Ronald Caparas, and PO1 Allan Mapula.
On the other hand, the defense presented accused-appellants Laurora and Feliciano, and accused Maglalang and Ruelo as its witnesses.
The Prosecution's Version of Facts
On February 22, 2006, at around 10 o'clock in the evening, PO2 Monte, who was stationed at the police headquarters, received a telephone call from a concerned citizen.  The caller reported that an illegal drug trade was being operated by a certain "Janggo" at the Rodriguez Compound, 
Barangay
 Rosario, Pasig City. Such information validated the letter-complaint the police had earlier received from the 
Barangay
 Captain of 
Barangay
 Rosario, implicating a similar person called "Janggo" in drug-related activities.
[6]
Immediately after receiving the telephone call, PO2 Monte informed his team leader, Police Inspector Ronald Pamor, about the alleged drug trade. Pamor then instructed PO2 Monte to get the assistance of the concerned citizen for the immediate apprehension of "Janggo."
[7]
  After learning about this, the concerned citizen sent a person by the name of "Buboy" to the police headquarters to help.  Pamor talked with "Buboy," after which he organized a buy-bust operation against "Janggo."
[8]
PO2 Monte was designated as poseur-buyer and, for that purpose, he was given two PhP 100 bills where he put his initials "BVM."  Meanwhile, PO2 Caparas, PO1 Mapula, and PO1 Paterno Vega II were designated as immediate back-ups of PO2 Monte.  A pre-operation report was prepared and sent to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).
[9]
  After coordinating with the PDEA, the buy-bust team and the confidential informant went to the target area on board a passenger-type jeepney.
After parking their vehicle about 50 meters away from the house of "Janggo," PO2 Monte and the informant proceeded towards it, followed by other members of the team.
[10]
  Upon reaching the house, PO2 Monte saw a man standing in front of it whom the informant identified as "Janggo."  They approached "Janggo" and then saw a woman standing on the doorway.
[11]
  The informant introduced PO2 Monte to "Janggo" as a regular buyer of 
shabu
.  The latter then asked PO2 Monte how much he intended to buy, to which he answered, "P200.00."
[12]
  While PO2 Monte was talking to "Janggo," he noticed two women and a man seated inside the house. "Janggo" then asked the woman standing near the doorway if she had any 
shabu
.  The woman then pulled a plastic sachet from her right pocket which she handed to "Janggo," who, in turn, handed it to PO2 Monte.
[13]
Upon receiving and examining the plastic sachet, PO2 Monte took off his baseball cap, the pre-arranged signal to signify the consummation of the sale.
[14]
  The back-up operatives then rushed to assist PO2 Monte.  At this point, PO2 Monte identified himself as a police officer and grabbed the left arm of "Janggo."  When PO2 Caparas arrived at the scene, PO2 Monte shouted that there were more persons inside the house.  PO2 Caparas then apprehended the woman standing near the doorway, while PO1 Vega and PO1 Mapula cornered the three other persons inside the house.
[15]
Subsequently, in open court, "Janggo" was identified as accused-appellant Feliciano, while the woman standing near the doorway as accused-appellant Laurora.  The other persons apprehended inside the house were likewise identified as the other accused Ruelo, Maglalang, and the now deceased May Estrella.  All of them were brought to the police station for further investigation, after which they were brought to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame for the mandatory drug examination.
Version of the Defense
In contrast, accused-appellants interposed the defense of denial.  Live-in partners Feliciano and Laurora claimed that, at the fateful night of their arrest, they were preparing dinner when certain police officers just barged inside their house.
[16]
  The police officers then put them under arrest without any reason or explanation and despite their protests. Accused-appellants further claimed that the police officers asked them to produce PhP 10,000 in exchange for their release.
[17]
  Failing to produce the amount, charges were then filed against them.
The testimony of Ruelo is corroborative of the story of accused-appellants.  He said that he was staying at the house and that he is the brother of Laurora.  He confirmed the statement of his co-accused that the police just barged inside the house and, without any reason, put all of them under arrest after searching it.
Ruling of the Trial Court
After trial, the RTC found all the accused guilty of the crime. The dispositive portion of its Decision reads:

x x x x
SO ORDERED.
[18]
On appeal to the CA, accused-appellants disputed the lower court's decision finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. They argued that the lower court erred in admitting the seized dangerous drugs as evidence considering that the arrest was unlawful. Further, they contend that the prosecution failed to establish every link in the chain of custody of the drugs.
Ruling of the Appellate Court
On August 11, 2009, the CA affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The dispositive portion of the Decision of the CA reads:
WHEREFORE
, the foregoing considered, the instant appeal is hereby DISMISSED and the assailed Decision AFFIRMED 
in toto
. No costs.
SO ORDERED
.
[19]
Accused-appellants timely filed a notice of appeal of the decision of the CA.
The Issues
Accused-appellants assign the following errors:
I.
The trial court gravely erred in admitting the seized dangerous drug as evidence against the accused-appellants despite being the result of an unlawful arrest.
II.
The trial court gravely erred in pronouncing the guilt of the accused-appellants despite the arresting officers' non-compliance with the requirements for the proper custody of seized dangerous drugs under R.A. No. 9165.
III.
The trial court gravely erred in pronouncing the guilt of the accused-appellants despite the unjustified failure of the arresting officers to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized dangerous drug.
[20]
Our Ruling
The appeal has no merit.
Buy-Bust Operation Was Legitimate and Valid
Accused-appellants contend that the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation had sufficient time to obtain a warrant of arrest considering that they were already in possession of pertinent information, i.e., the letter-complaint from the 
Barangay
 Captain.  Thus, they argue that the police officers had no basis to show any urgency upon which to justify a warrantless arrest.
We disagree.
It is settled that a buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment that is resorted to for trapping and capturing criminals.  It is legal and has been proved to be an effective method of apprehending drug peddlers, provided due regard to constitutional and legal safeguards is undertaken.
[21]
Accused-appellants want to convince this Court that their arrest was illegal. As aptly held by the CA, "[a]ppellant's argument that the police officers should have instead secured an arrest warrant is misplaced and untenable considering the nature of the offense involved, the obscurity of the transgressors thereof, and the unpredictability of the transaction subject of the offense."  Moreover, this Court has ruled time and again that a buy-bust operation is employed to trap and catch a malefactor 
in flagrante delicto
.
[22]
  In fact, there is a fine distinction between entrapping a criminal versus instigating him to commit the crime, to wit:
ENTRAPMENT AND INSTIGATION.Â¾While it has been said that the practice of entrapping persons into crime for the purpose of instituting criminal prosecutions is to be deplored, and while instigation, as distinguished from mere entrapment, has often been condemned and has sometimes been held to prevent the act from being criminal or punishable, the general rule is that it is no defense to the perpetrator of a crime that facilities for its commission were purposely placed in his way, or that the criminal act was done at the `decoy solicitation' of persons seeking to expose the criminal, or that detectives feigning complicity in the act were present and apparently assisting in its commission. Especially is this true in that class of cases where the offense is one of a kind habitually committed, and the solicitation merely furnishes evidence of a course of conduct. Mere deception by the detective will not shield defendant, if the offense was committed by him, free from the influence or instigation of the detective.  The fact that an agent of an owner acts as a supposed confederate of a thief is no defense to the latter in a prosecution for larceny, provided the original design was formed independently of such agent; and where a person approached by the thief as his confederate notifies the owner or the public authorities, and, being authorised by them to do so, assists the thief in carrying out the plan, the larceny is nevertheless committed.  It is generally held that it is no defense to a prosecution for an illegal sale of liquor that the purchase was made by a `spotter,' detective, or hired informer; but there are cases holding the contrary.
[23]
Clearly, in this case, the buy-bust operation was proper. All the essential elements of the crime of illegal sale of drugs have been established, i.e.,
 
(1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for it.
[24]
  What is material is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place.  The delivery of the illicit drug to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money successfully consummate the buy-bust transaction.
In the instant case, the prosecution was able to establish these elements beyond moral certainty.  Accused-appellants sold the 
shabu
 for PhP 200 to PO2 Monte posing as buyer; the said drug was seized and identified as a prohibited drug and subsequently presented in evidence; there was actual exchange of the marked money and contraband; and finally, accused-appellant Feliciano was fully aware that he was selling and delivering a prohibited drug.  This much was testified to by PO2 Monte:

Q-        After that, in order to bring appropriate charges against the accused, what document did you prepare?
A-        My affidavit of arrest.
[42]
Further, the subsequent seizure of the evidence against them was likewise proper.  The illegal drug seized was not the "fruit of the poisonous tree" as accused-appellants would like us to believe.  The seizure made by the buy-bust team falls under a search incidental to a lawful arrest under Rule 126, Sec. 13 of the Rules of Court.
[43]
 Since the buy-bust operation was proper, it necessarily follows that the search was also valid.
Chain of Custody Was Properly Established
Accused-appellant Feliciano further maintains that the police officers failed to mark, inventory, and photograph the prohibited items allegedly seized from him at the time of his apprehension.  Further, he contends that the prosecution failed to present as its witness the investigator who was supposed to be the current custodian of the subject drug.
Such argument must fail.
The Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 provides:
SECTION 21. 
Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.
Â¾
The PDEA shall take
 
charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:
(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; 
Provided
, that 
the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted
 
at the place where the search warrant is served; or
 
at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures
; 
Provided, further,
 that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items
 x x x.  (Emphasis supplied.)
Clearly, the law itself lays down exceptions to its requirements.  Thus, non-compliance with the provision is not fatal.  In fact, it is settled that non-compliance with Sec. 21 of the IRR does not render an accused's arrest illegal or make the items seized inadmissible.
[44]
 What is imperative is "the preservation of the integrity and the evidential value of the seized items as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused."
[45]
In the instant case, the chain of custody can be established through the following link: (1) PO2 Monte marked the seized sachet subject of the buy-bust with "ERF 2-23-06," the initials of accused-appellant Feliciano and the date of the buy-bust; (2) a request for laboratory examination of the seized item "ERF 2-23-06" was signed by Pamor;
[46]
 (3) the request and the marked item seized were received by the PNP Crime Laboratory; (4) Chemistry Report No. D-161-06 confirmed that the marked items seized from accused-appellants were methylamphetamine hydrochloride;
[47]
 and (5) the marked item was offered in evidence as Exhibit "K."
Moreover, no proof was adduced to support the claim that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized drugs were compromised. Thus, this Court finds no reason to overturn the finding of the trial court that the same drugs seized from accused-appellants were the same ones presented during trial.  As it were, the chain of custody of the illicit drugs seized from accused-appellants remains unbroken.
WHEREFORE
