In her Letter
[3] 
 dated 30 January 2008, Ignacio explained that she often came in late for work because she always had to attend to the needs of her parents as her father had suffered a second stroke in January 2007 and her mother was suffering from hypertension and high blood sugar condition. She also stated that being the only child of her parents remaining in the country, she often acted as their sole caregiver. Nevertheless, she expressed deep regrets for her tardiness and accordingly pledged to report for work on time.
The OCA found that Ignacio's explanation does not merit consideration to justify her habitual tardiness and recommended that she be reprimanded and warned that a repetition of the same or similar offense will warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.
The Court approves the OCA's findings and recommendations.
Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 23, series of 1998 describes habitual tardiness as follows:
Any employee shall be considered habitually tardy if he incurs tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes, ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or at least two (2) consecutive months during the year.
It is unequivocal that Ignacio is guilty of habitual tardiness. Her explanation and apology failed to justify the tardiness she had incurred and her exemption from the imposition of the penalties provided by law. Moral obligations, performance of household chores, traffic problems and health, domestic and financial concerns are not sufficient reasons to excuse habitual tardiness.
[4]
Ignacio fell short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the administration of justice. By reason of the nature and functions of the judiciary where she belongs, its employees must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional canon that public office is a public trust. Inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service, if only to recompense the  government,  and  ultimately the people who shoulder the cost of
maintaining the judiciary.  Thus, to inspire public respect for the justice system, court officials and employees are at all times behooved to strictly observe official time. As punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are impermissible.
[5]
Section 52(c)(4), Rule VI of Civil Service Circular No. 19, series of 1999 on the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, provides:
C.        The following are Light Offenses with corresponding penalties:
x x x
4.         Frequent unauthorized tardiness (Habitual Tardiness)
1st Offense       -           Reprimand
2nd Offense      -           Suspension 1-30 days
3rd Offense      -           Dismissal
x x x
Considering that this is Ignacio's first offense, the penalty of reprimand is appropriate.
WHEREFORE, Aida Josefina J. Ignacio, Clerk III of the Metropolitan Trial  Court  of  Pasay  City,  Branch 48, is found guilty of habitual   tardiness   and   is hereby REPRIMANDED with a stern
warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.
SO ORDERED.
Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Ynares-santiago, Carpio Morales,
 and 
Velasco, Jr., JJ.,
 concur.
