REYES, R.T., J.:


Under consideration is the Manifestation and Motion
[1]
 dated October 26, 2007 of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) which states:
The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) respectfully avers that in an Indorsement dated October 24, 2007, the Legal Service of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) has informed it of the Philippine Government's decision not to continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project (see attachment
[2]
).  That said, there is no more justiciable controversy for this Honorable Court to resolve.  WHEREFORE, public respondents respectfully pray that the present petitions be DISMISSED.
On November 13, 2007, the Court noted the OSG's manifestation and motion and required petitioners in G.R. Nos. 178830, 179317, and 179613 to comment.
On December 6, 2007, Rolex Suplico, petitioner in G.R. No. 178830, filed his Consolidated Reply and Opposition,
[3]
 opposing the aforequoted OSG Manifestation and Motion, arguing that:
Aside from the fact that the 
Notes of the Meeting Between President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Chinese President Hu Jintao 
held 2 October 2007 were not attached to the 26 October 2007 Manifestation and Motion - thus depriving petitioners of the opportunity to comment thereon - a mere verbally requested 
1
st
 Indorsement 
is not sufficient basis for the conclusion that the ZTE-DOTC NBN deal has been permanently scrapped.
Suffice to state, said 
1
st
 Indorsement 
is glaringly 
self-serving
, especially without the 
Notes of the Meeting Between President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Chinese President Hu Jintao
 to support its allegations or other proof of the supposed decision to cancel the ZTE-DOTC NBN deal.  
Public respondents can certainly do better than that.
[4]
Petitioner Suplico further argues that:
Assuming arguendo 
that some aspects of the present Petition have been rendered moot (which is vehemently denied), this Honorable Court, consistent with well-entrenched jurisprudence, may still take cognizance thereof.
[5]
Petitioner Suplico cites this Court's rulings in 
Gonzales v. Chavez
,
[6]
 
Rufino v. Endriga
,
[7]
 and 
Alunan 
III
 v. Mirasol
[8]
 that despite their mootness, the Court nevertheless took cognizance of these cases and ruled on the merits due to the Court's symbolic function of educating the bench and the bar by formulating guiding and controlling principles, precepts, doctrines, and rules.
On January 31, 2008, Amsterdam Holdings, Inc. (AHI) and Nathaniel Sauz, petitioners in G.R. No. 179317, also filed their comment expressing their sentiments, thus:
First of all, the present administration has never been known for candor.  The present administration has a very nasty habit of not keeping its word. It says one thing, but does another.
This being the case, herein petitioners are unable to bring themselves to feel even a bit reassured that the government, in the event that the above-captioned cases are dismissed, will not backtrack, re-transact, or even resurrect the now infamous NBN-ZTE transaction.  This is especially relevant since what was attached to the OSG's Manifestation and Motion was a mere one (1) page written communication sent by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to the OSG, allegedly relaying that the Philippine Government has decided not to continue with the NBN project 
"x x x due to several reasons and constraints."
Petitioners AHI and Sauz further contend that because of the transcendental importance of the issues raised in the petition, which among others, included the President's use of the power to borrow, i.e., to enter into foreign loan agreements, this Court should take cognizance of this case despite its apparent mootness.
On January 15, 2008, the Court required the OSG to file respondents' reply to petitioners' comments on its manifestation and motion.
On April 18, 2008, the OSG filed respondents' reply, reiterating their position that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy - one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice.
[9]
Respondents also insist that there is no perfected contract in this case that would prejudice the government or public interest.  Explaining the nature of the NBN Project as an executive agreement, respondents stress that it remained in the negotiation stage.  The conditions precedent
[10]
 for the agreement to become effective have not yet been complied with.
Respondents further oppose petitioners' claim of the right to information, which they contend is not an absolute right.  They contend that the matters raised concern executive policy, a political question which the judicial branch of government would generally hesitate to pass upon.
On July 2, 2008, the OSG filed a Supplemental Manifestation and Motion.  Appended to it is the Highlights from the Notes of Meeting between President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Chinese President Hu Jintao, held in XI Jiao Guesthouse, Shanghai, China, on October 2, 2007.  In the Notes of Meeting, the Philippine Government conveyed its decision not to continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project due to several constraints.  The same Notes likewise contained President Hu Jintao's expression of understanding of the Philippine Government decision.
We resolve to grant the motion.
Firstly
, the Court notes the triple petitions to be for 
certiorari
, prohibition and mandamus, with application for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Preliminary Injunction.  The individual prayers in each of the three (3) consolidated petitions are:
G.R. No. 178830
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court:
Upon the filing of this Petition, pursuant to the second paragraph of Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, issue 
forthwith 
an 
ex parte 
temporary restraining order 
enjoining respondents
, their subordinates, agents, representatives and any and all persons acting on their behalf 
from pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal
;
Compel respondents
, upon Writ of Mandamus, 
to 
forthwith
 produce and furnish petitioner or his undersigned counsel a certified true copy of the contract or agreement covering the NBN project as agreed upon with ZTE Corporation
;
Schedule Oral Arguments in the present case pursuant to Rule 49 in relation to Section 2, Rule 56 of the revised Rules of Court; and,
Annul and set aside the award of the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal
, and compel public respondents to 
forthwith
 comply with pertinent provisions of law regarding procurement of government ICT contracts and public bidding for the NBN contract.
[11]
  (Emphasis supplied)
G.R. No. 179317
WHEREFORE, petitioners Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and Nathaniel Sauz respectfully pray as follows:
upon the filing of this Petition for Mandamus and conditioned upon the posting of a bond in such amount as the Honorable Court may fix, a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction 
be issued directing the Department of Transportation and Communication
, the Commission on Information and Communications Technology, all other government agencies and instrumentalities, their officers, employees, and/or other persons acting for and on their behalf 
to desist
 during the pendency of the instant Petition for Mandamus 
from entering into any other agreements and from commencing with any kind, sort, or specie of activity in connection with the National Broadband Network Project
;
the instant Petition for Mandamus be given due course; and,
after due consideration of all relevant issues, judgment be rendered directing respondents to allow herein petitioners access to all agreements entered into with the Government of China, the ZTE Corporation, and/or other entities, government instrumentalities, and/or individuals with regard to the National Broadband Network Project.
[12]
  (Emphasis supplied)
G.R. No. 179613
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court to:
Compel respondents, upon Writ of Mandamus, 
to 
forthwith
 produce and furnish petitioner or his undersigned counsel a certified true copy of the contract or agreement covering the NBN project as agreed upon with ZTE Corporation
;
Schedule Oral Arguments in the present case pursuant to Rule 49 in relation to Section 2, Rule 56 of the Revised Rules of Court;
Annul and set aside the award of the contract for the national broadband network to respondent ZTE Corporation
, upon the ground that said contract, as well as the procedures resorted to preparatory to the execution thereof, is contrary to the Constitution, to law and to public policy;
Compel public respondent to 
forthwith
 comply with pertinent provisions of law regarding procurement of government infrastructure projects
, including public bidding for said contract to undertake the construction of the national broadband network.

On September 11, 2007, the Court issued a TRO
[14]
 in G.R. No. 178830, enjoining the parties from "pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and Project" as prayed for.  Pertinent parts of the said Order read:
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, on 11 September 2007, adopted a resolution in the above-entitled case, to wit:
"G.R. No. 178830 (
Rolex Suplico vs. National Economic and Development Authority
, represented by NEDA Secretary Romulo L. Neri, and the NEDA Investment Coordination Committee, Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), represented by DOTC Secretary Leandro Mendoza, including the Commission on Information and Communications Technology, headed by its Chairman, Ramon P. Sales, The Telecommunications Office, Bids and Awards for Information and Communications Technology Committee (ICT), headed by DOTC Assistant Secretary Elmer A. Soneja as Chairman, and The Technical Working Group for ICT, and DOTC Assistant Secretary Lorenzo Formoso, and All Other Operating Units of the DOTC for Information and Communications Technology, and ZTE Corporation, Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and ARESCOM, Inc.--Acting on the instant petition with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction, the Court Resolved, without giving due course to the petition, to
x x x x
(d) Issue a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, enjoining the (i) National Economic and Development Authority, (ii) NEDA-Investment Coordination Committee, (iii) Department of Transportation and Communications, Commission on Information and Communications Technology, (iv) Telecommunications Office, Bids and Awards for Information and Communications Technology Committee (ICT), (v) Technical Working Group for ICT, and all other Operating Units of the DOTC for Information and Communications Technology, (vi) ZTE Corporation; (vii) Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and (viii) ARESCOM, Inc., and any and all persons acting on their behalf from `pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and Project' as prayed for."
NOW THEREFORE, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, You, Respondents (i) National Economic and Development Authority, (ii) NEDA-Investment Coordination Committee, (iii) Department of Transportation and Communications, Commission on Information and Communications Technology, (iv) Telecommunications Office, Bids and Awards for Information and Communications Technology Committee (ICT), (v) Technical Working Group for ICT, and all other Operating Units of the DOTC for Information and Communications Technology, (vi) ZTE Corporation; (vii) Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and (viii) ARESCOM, Inc., and any and all persons acting on their behalf are hereby 
ENJOINED
 
from "pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and Project" as prayed for
.
[15]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 178830 and 179613 pray that they be furnished certified true copies of the "contract or agreement covering the NBN project as agreed upon with ZTE Corporation."  It appears that during one of the Senate hearings on the NBN project, copies of the supply contract
[16]
 were readily made available to petitioners.
[17]
 Evidently, the said prayer has been complied with and is, thus, 
mooted
.
When President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, acting in her official capacity during the meeting held on October 2, 2007 in China, informed China's President Hu Jintao that the Philippine Government had decided not to continue with the ZTE-National Broadband Network (ZTE-NBN) Project due to several reasons and constraints, there is no doubt that 
all the other principal prayers in the three petitions
 (to annul, set aside, and enjoin the implementation of the ZTE-NBN Project) 
had also become moot
.
Contrary to petitioners' contentions that these declarations made by officials belonging to the executive branch on the Philippine Government's decision not to continue with the ZTE-NBN Project are self-serving, hence, inadmissible, the Court has no alternative but to take judicial notice of this official act of the President of the Philippines.
Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court provides:
SECTION 1. 
Judicial Notice, 
when mandatory
. - 
A court shall take judicial notice, 
without introduction of evidence
, of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of the Philippines, 
the official acts of the 
legislative, 
executive 
and judicial 
departments of the Philippines
, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions.  (Emphasis supplied)
Under the rules, it is 
mandatory
 and the Court has no alternative but to take judicial notice of the official acts of the President of the Philippines, who heads the executive branch of our government.  It is further provided in the above-quoted rule that the court shall take judicial notice of the foregoing facts 
without introduction of evidence
.  Since we consider the act of cancellation by President Macapagal-Arroyo of the proposed ZTE-NBN Project during the meeting of October 2, 2007 with the Chinese President in China as an 
official act of the executive department
, the Court must take judicial notice of such official act without need of evidence.
In 
David v. Macapagal-Arroyo
,
[18]
 We took judicial notice of the announcement by the Office of the President banning all rallies and canceling all permits for public assemblies following the issuance of Presidential Proclamation No. 1017 and General Order No. 5.
In 
Estrada v. Desierto
,
[19]
 the Court also resorted to judicial notice in resolving the factual ingredient of the petition.
Moreover, under Section 2, paragraph (m) of Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, the 
official duty 
of the executive officials
[20]
 of informing this Court of the government's decision not to continue with the ZTE-NBN Project is also presumed to 
have been regularly performed
, absent proof to the contrary.  Other than petitioner AHI's unsavory insinuation in its comment, the Court finds no factual or legal basis to disregard this disputable presumption in the present instance.
Concomitant to its fundamental task as the ultimate citadel of justice and legitimacy is the judiciary's role of strengthening political stability indispensable to progress and national development.  Pontificating on issues which no longer legitimately constitute an actual case or controversy will do more harm than good to the nation as a whole. Wise exercise of judicial discretion militates against resolving the academic issues, as petitioners want this Court to do.   This is especially true where, as will be further discussed, the legal issues raised cannot be resolved without previously establishing the factual basis or antecedents.
Judicial power presupposes actual controversies, the very antithesis    of mootness.  In the absence of actual justiciable controversies or disputes, the Court generally opts to refrain from deciding moot issues.  Where there is no more live subject of controversy, the Court ceases to have a reason to render any ruling or make any pronouncement.
Kapag wala nang buhay na kaso, wala nang dahilan para magdesisyon ang Husgado.
In 
Republic Telecommunications Holdings, Inc. v. Santiago
,
[21]
 the lone issue tackled by the Court of Appeals (CA) was whether the Securities Investigation and Clearing Department (SICD) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
en banc
 committed reversible error in issuing and upholding, respectively, the writ of preliminary injunction. The writ enjoined the execution of the questioned agreements between Qualcomm, Inc. and Republic Telecommunications Holdings, Inc. (RETELCOM).  The implementation of the agreements was restrained through the assailed orders of the SICD and the SEC 
en banc
 which, however, were nullified by the CA decision.  Thus, RETELCOM elevated the matter to this Court praying for the reinstatement of the writ of preliminary injunction of the SICD and the SEC 
en banc
.  However, before the matter was finally resolved, Qualcomm, Inc. withdrew from the negotiating table.  Its withdrawal had thwarted the execution and enforcement of the contracts.  Thus, the resolution of whether the implementation of said agreements should be enjoined became no longer necessary.
Equally applicable to the present case is the Court ruling in the above-cited 
Republic Telecommunications
.  There We held, thus:
Indeed, the instant petition, insofar as it assails the Court of Appeals' Decision nullifying the orders of the SEC en banc and the SICD, has been rendered moot and academic.  To rule, one way or the other, on the correctness of the questioned orders of the SEC en banc and the SICD will be indulging in a theoretical exercise that has no practical worth in view of the supervening event.
The rule is well-settled that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy - one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice.  Where the issue has become moot and academic, there is no justiciable controversy, and an adjudication thereon would be of no practical use or value as courts do not sit to adjudicate mere academic questions to satisfy scholarly interest, however intellectually challenging.
In the ultimate analysis, petitioners are seeking the reinstatement of the writ of injunction to prevent the concerned parties from pushing through with transactions with Qualcomm, Inc.  Given that Qualcomm, Inc. is no longer interested in pursuing the contracts, there is no actual substantial relief to which petitioners would be entitled and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition.
The Court likewise finds it unnecessary to rule whether the assailed Court of Appeals' Decision had the effect of overruling the Court's Resolution dated 29 January 1999, which set aside the TRO issued by the appellate court.
A ruling on the matter practically partakes of a mere advisory opinion, which falls beyond the realm of judicial review.  The exercise of the power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies. Courts have no authority to pass upon issues through advisory opinions or to resolve hypothetical or feigned problems.
While there were occasions when the Court passed upon issues although supervening events had rendered those petitions moot and academic, the instant case does not fall under the exceptional cases.  In those cases, the Court was persuaded to resolve moot and academic issues to formulate guiding and controlling constitutional principles, precepts, doctrines or rules for future guidance of both bench and bar.
In the case at bar, the resolution of whether a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued to prevent the implementation of the assailed contracts calls for an appraisal of factual considerations which are peculiar only to the transactions and parties involved in this controversy.  Except for the determination of whether petitioners are entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction which is now moot, the issues raised in this petition do not call for a clarification of any constitutional principle or the interpretation of any statutory provision.
[22]
Secondly
, even assuming that the Court will choose to disregard the foregoing considerations and brush aside mootness, the Court cannot completely rule on the merits of the case because 
the resolution of the three petitions involves settling factual issues which definitely requires reception of evidence
. There is not an iota of doubt that 
this may not be done by this Court in the first instance because
, as has been stated often enough, 
this Court is not a trier of facts
.
Ang pagpapasiya sa tatlong petisyon ay nangangailangan ng paglilitis na hindi gawain ng Hukumang ito.
Respondent ZTE, in its Comment in G.R. No. 178830,
[23]
 correctly pointed out that since petitioner Suplico filed his petition directly with this Court, without prior factual findings made by any lower court, a determination of pertinent and relevant facts is needed. ZTE enumerated some of these factual issues, to wit: 
 
 
(1) 
 
Whether an executive agreement has been reached between the Philippine and Chinese governments over the NBN Project;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
Whether the ZTE Supply Contract was entered into by the Republic of the Philippines, through the DOTC, and ZTE International pursuant to, and as an integral part of, the executive agreement;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) 
 
Whether a loan agreement for the NBN Project has actually been executed;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
Whether the Philippine government required that the NBN Project be completed under a Build-Operate-and-Transfer Scheme;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
 
Whether the AHI proposal complied with the requirements for an unsolicited proposal under the BOT Law;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
 
Whether the Philippine government has actually earmarked public finds for disbursement under the ZTE Supply Contract; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(7) 
 
Whether the coverage of the NBN Project to be supplied under the ZTE Supply Contract is more extensive than that under the AHI proposal or such other proposal submitted therefor.
[24]
 
 
Definitely, some very specific reliefs prayed for in both G.R. Nos. 178830 and 179613 require prior determination of facts before pertinent legal issues could be resolved and specific reliefs granted.
In 
G.R. No. 178830
, petitioner seeks to 
a
nnul and set aside
 the award of the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and compel public respondents to 
forthwith
 comply with pertinent provisions of law regarding procurement of government ICT contracts and public bidding for the NBN contract.
In 
G.R. No. 179613
,  petitioners also pray that the Court 
annul and set aside the award
 of the contract for the national broadband network to respondent ZTE Corporation, upon the ground that said contract, as well as the procedures resorted to preparatory to the execution thereof, is contrary to the Constitution, to law and to public policy.  They also ask the Court to 
compel public respondent to 
forthwith
 comply with pertinent provisions of law regarding procurement
 of government infrastructure projects, including public bidding for said contract to undertake the construction of the national broadband network.
It is simply 
impossible
 for this Court "
to annul and set aside the award of the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal
" 
without any evidence
 to support a prior factual finding pointing to any violation of law that could lead to such annulment order.  For sure, the Supreme Court is not the proper venue for this factual matter to be threshed out.
Thirdly
, petitioner Suplico in G.R. No. 178830 prayed that this Court order "public respondents to 
forthwith
 comply with pertinent provisions of law regarding procurement of government ICT contracts and public bidding for the NBN contract."
[25]
   
It would be too presumptuous on the part of the Court to summarily compel public respondents
 to comply with pertinent provisions of law regarding procurement of government infrastructure projects 
without any factual basis
 or prior determination of very particular violations committed by specific government officials of the executive branch.  For the Court to do so would amount to a breach of the norms of comity among co-equal branches of government.  A perceived error cannot be corrected by committing another error.  Without proper evidence, the Court cannot just presume that the executive did not comply with procurement laws.  Should the Court allow itself to fall into this trap, it would plainly commit grave error itself.
Magiging kapangahasan sa Hukumang ito na pilitin ang mga pinipetisyon na tumalima sa batas sa pangongontrata ng pamahalaan kung wala pang pagtitiyak o angkop na ebidensiya ng nagawang paglabag dito.
Let it be clarified that the Senate investigation in aid of legislation cannot be the basis of Our decision which requires a 
judicial
 finding of facts.
Justice Antonio T. Carpio takes the view that the National Broadband Network Project should be declared null and void.  The foregoing threefold reasons would suffice to address the concern of Our esteemed colleague.
The Court is, therefore, constrained to dismiss the petitions and deny them due course because of mootness and because their resolution requires reception of evidence which cannot be done in an original petition brought before the Supreme Court.
WHEREFORE
, the petitions are 
DISMISSED
. The Temporary Restraining Order issued on September 11, 2007 is

DISSENTING OPINION
CARPIO, J.:
I dissent on the ground that the ZTE Supply Contract is 
void from the beginning
 for being contrary to the Constitution, the Administrative Code of 1987, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Government Procurement Reform Act.  As such, the ZTE Supply Contract is legally non-existent.  The Philippine Government's decision "not to continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project"
[1]
 during the pendency of this case, even if deemed a cancellation of the ZTE Supply Contract, had no legal effect on the status of the contract, and did not moot this petition.
This case is of transcendental importance to the nation since it involves the constitutionality of a US$329.48 million (approximately P14.82 billion) government procurement contract awarded and signed 
without an appropriation from Congress and without public bidding
.  This case puts to the test the efficacy of constitutional and statutory proscriptions designed precisely to prevent such contracts.  The Court has a duty to resolve the important issues in this case, including the novel question on the status of executive agreements that conflict with national law, to prevent a recurrence of government contracts that violate the Constitution and existing statutes.
Not only are the legal issues in this case "capable of repetition yet evading review."
[2]
  The ZTE Supply Contract itself is capable of being resurrected.   Public respondents merely stated that the Philippine Government would "not continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project," citing as basis the 1
st
 Indorsement dated 24 October 2007 from the DOTC.  Public respondents did not manifest that the ZTE Supply Contract had been mutually cancelled by the parties to the contract.
Equally important, private respondent ZTE Corporation has not manifested to this Court its consent to the discontinuance or cancellation of the ZTE Supply Contract.  Indeed, private respondent ZTE Corporation has not wavered from its position that "the ZTE Supply Contract is entirely legal and proper."
[3]  
It is axiomatic that one party to a bilateral contract cannot unilaterally declare a contract discontinued or cancelled.  Clearly, this case is far from being moot.
Petitioner assails the ZTE Supply Contract as void from the beginning on two grounds.  First, the contract has no appropriation from Congress, violating Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution. Second, the absence of public bidding violates the Government Procurement Reform Act.
In their Comment, public respondents attached the ZTE Supply Contract dated 21 April 2007, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of Philippines-China Economic Partnership dated 5 June 2006, and the letters between Philippine and Chinese officials relating to the National Broadband Network Project. These attachments mooted petitioner's prayer for copies of these documents, leaving as sole issue of this petition the legal status of the ZTE Supply Contract.
This 
Petition for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and Writs of Prohibition and/or Permanent Injunction, and Mandamus
 seeks, among others, to annul the ZTE Supply Contract and to prohibit public respondents from disbursing public funds to implement the contract.  The Constitution and existing statutes prohibit public officers from disbursing public funds without the corresponding appropriation from Congress.  Existing statutes also prohibit public officials from entering into procurement contracts without a certificate of appropriation and fund availability from the proper accounting and auditing officials. It is the ministerial duty of public officials to not only desist from disbursing public funds without the corresponding appropriation from Congress, but also to refrain from signing and implementing procurement contracts without the requisite certificate of appropriation and fund availability.  Indisputably, a petition for prohibition is a proper action to test the legality of such disbursement of public funds and the legality of the execution of such procurement contracts.
[4]
From the admissions of respondents in their Consolidated Comment, the following facts are undisputed:
The ZTE Supply Contract, a procurement of goods and services for the Philippine Government, was signed on 21 April 2007 by DOTC Secretary Leandro R. Mendoza and ZTE Corporation Vice President Yu Yong;
[5]
There was no public bidding in the award of the contract to ZTE Corporation, and the Chinese Government handpicked ZTE Corporation to supply the goods and services to the Philippine Government;
[6]
The ZTE Supply Contract is to be financed by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China to the Philippine Government;
[7]
The Loan Agreement to finance the ZTE Supply Contract was not concluded before or after the signing of the ZTE Supply Contract;
[8]
There is no appropriation law enacted by Congress to fund the ZTE Supply Contract;
[9]
A certificate of appropriation and fund availability is not attached to the ZTE Supply Contract;
[10]
  and
ZTE Corporation is publicly listed in the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
[11]
In addition, the 2006 and 2007 General Appropriations Acts
[12]
 do not contain any appropriation for a foreign-assisted National Broadband Network Project, under which the ZTE Supply Contract would fall.
This case raises the following issues:
Whether the ZTE Supply Contract is void from the beginning in the absence of an appropriation by law to fund the contract, and in the absence of a certificate of appropriation and fund availability; and
Whether the ZTE Supply Contract is void from the beginning in the absence of a public bidding.
The simple answer to each question is yes, the ZTE Supply Contract is void from the beginning.  The absence of 
any
 of the three  -  an appropriation law, a certificate of appropriation and fund availability, and public bidding  - renders the ZTE Supply Contract void from the beginning.
Absence of an Appropriation Law
The Constitution requires an appropriation law before public funds are spent for any purpose. Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution provides:
No money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.
[13]
The power of the purse - or the power of Congress to authorize payment from funds in the National Treasury -  is lodged 
exclusively
 in Congress.  One of the fundamental checks and balances finely crafted in the Constitution is that Congress authorizes the amount to be spent, while the Executive spends the amount so authorized.  The Executive cannot authorize its own spending, and neither can Congress spend what it has authorized.   The rationale of this basic check and balance is to prevent abuse of discretion in the expenditure of public funds.
Thus, the Executive branch cannot spend a single centavo of government receipts, whether from taxes, sales, donations, dividends, profits, loans, or from any other source, unless there is an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure.  Any government expenditure without the corresponding appropriation from Congress is unconstitutional.  There is no exception to this constitutional prohibition that "no money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law." This constitutional prohibition is self-executory.
To further insure compliance with Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution, the Administrative Code of 1987 
expressly prohibits
 
the entering into contracts
 involving the expenditure of public funds unless two prior requirements are satisfied. 
First
, there must be an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure required in the contract
. 
Second
, there must be attached to the contract a certification by the proper accounting official and auditor that funds have been appropriated by law and such funds are available
. Failure to comply with any of these two requirements renders the contract void.
Thus, Sections 46, 47 and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 provide:
SECTION  46.  Appropriation Before Entering into Contract. â (1) 
No contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor
, the unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is sufficient to cover the proposed expenditure; and
(2) Notwithstanding this provision, contracts for the procurement of supplies and materials to be carried in stock may be entered into under regulations of the Commission provided that when issued, the supplies and materials shall be charged to the proper appropriations account.
SECTION  47.   Certificate Showing Appropriation to Meet Contract. â Except in the case of a contract for personal service, for supplies for current consumption or to be carried in stock not exceeding the estimated consumption for three (3) months, or banking transactions of government-owned or controlled banks, 
no contract involving the expenditure of public funds by any government agency shall be entered into or authorized unless the proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current calendar year is available for expenditure on account thereof
, subject to verification by the auditor concerned. The certificate signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it, shall be attached to and become an integral part of the proposed contract, and the sum so certified shall not thereafter be available for expenditure for any other purpose until the obligation of the government agency concerned under the contract is fully extinguished.
SECTION  48.   Void Contract and Liability of Officer. â 
Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two (2) immediately preceding sections shall be void
, and the officer or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the Government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties.   (Emphasis supplied)
Sections 85, 86 and 87 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines,
[14]
 an earlier law, contain the same provisions.
The Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code expressly mandate that "
[N]o contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor
."
 
 The law prohibits the 
mere entering into a contract
 without the corresponding appropriation from Congress.  It does not matter whether the contract is subject to a condition as to its effectivity, such as a subsequent favorable legal opinion by the Department of Justice,
[15]
 because even a contract with such condition is still a contract under the law.
[16]
Moreover, the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code expressly mandate that "
[N]o contract involving the expenditure of public funds  x x x  shall be entered into or authorized unless the proper accounting official x x x shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current fiscal year is available for expenditure.
"  The law prohibits not only the entering into the contract, but also authorizing the entering into the contract without the certification from the proper accounting official. This means that the certificate of appropriation and fund availability must be issued 
before
 the signing of the contract.
In addition, the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code expressly require that the "
certificate signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it,
 
shall be attached
 
to and become an integral part of the proposed contract
."   The certificate of appropriation and fund availability must be 
attached to the 
"
proposed contract
," again clearly showing that the certificate must be issued 
before 
the signing of the contract.
In several cases, the Court had the occasion to apply these provisions of the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. In these cases, the Court clearly ruled that the two requirements  - the existence of appropriation and the attachment of the certification - are "
conditions 
sine qua non
 for the execution of government contracts
."  In 
COMELEC v. Quijano-Padilla,
[17]
  the Court ruled:
It is quite evident from the tenor of the language of the law that the existence of appropriations and the availability of funds are indispensable pre-requisites to or conditions 
sine qua non
 for the execution of government contracts. The obvious intent is to impose such conditions as 
a priori
 requisites to the validity of the proposed contract.
  Using this as our premise, we cannot accede to PHOTOKINA's contention that there is already a perfected contract. x x x
x x x
Petitioners are justified in refusing to formalize the contract with PHOTOKINA. Prudence dictated them not to enter into a contract not backed up by sufficient appropriation and available funds. Definitely, to act otherwise would be a futile exercise for the contract would inevitably suffer the vice of nullity.  In 
OsmeÃ±a vs. Commission on Audit
, this Court held:
The Auditing Code of the Philippines (P.D. 1445) further provides that no contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor and the proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current fiscal year is available for expenditure on account thereof. Any contract entered into contrary to the foregoing requirements shall be VOID.
Clearly then, the contract entered into by the former Mayor Duterte was void from the very beginning since the agreed cost for the project (P8,368,920.00) was way beyond the appropriated amount (P5,419,180.00) as certified by the City Treasurer. Hence, the contract was properly declared void and unenforceable in COA's 2nd Indorsement, dated September 4, 1986. The COA declared and we agree, that:
The prohibition contained in Sec. 85 of PD 1445 (Government Auditing Code) is explicit and mandatory. 
Fund availability is, as it has always been, an indispensable prerequisite to the execution of any government contract involving the expenditure of public funds by all government agencies at all levels.
 Such contracts are not to be considered as final or binding unless such a certification as to fund availability is issued (Letter of Instruction No. 767, s. 1978). Antecedent of advance appropriation is thus essential to government liability on contracts (Zobel vs. City of Manila, 47 Phil. 169). This contract being violative of the legal requirements aforequoted, the same contravenes Sec. 85 of PD 1445 and is null and void by virtue of Sec. 87.
Verily, the contract, as expressly declared by law, is inexistent and void ab initio.  This is to say that the proposed contract is without force and effect from the very beginning or from its incipiency, as if it had never been entered into, and hence, cannot be validated either by lapse of time or ratification.   (Emphasis supplied)
The law expressly declares void a procurement contract that fails to comply with the two requirements, namely, an appropriation law funding the contract and a certification of appropriation and fund availability.   The clear purpose of these requirements is to insure that government contracts are never signed unless supported by the corresponding appropriation law and fund availability.
[18]
  
The ZTE Supply Contract does not comply with any of these two requirements.
   Thus, the ZTE Supply Contract is void for violation of Sections 46, 47 and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, as well as Sections 85, 86 and 87 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. These provisions of both Codes implement Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution.
Public respondent National Economic and Development Authority is fully aware that all proceeds of loans and grants secured by the Philippine Government cannot be disbursed without an appropriation from Congress.  Public respondent National Economic and Development Authority and its officials know, or ought to know by heart, that this is a fundamental requirement of the Constitution and existing statutes.  The National Economic and Development Authority has succinctly summarized this fundamental rule in Section 5.1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations for the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Act of 1996:
Section 5.1. General Principles on Budget -  All expenditures, inclusive of counterpart and 
proceeds of loans
 and loans and grant funds, must be included in the annual national expenditure program to be submitted to Congress for approval.  (Emphasis supplied)
There can be no dispute that the proceeds of foreign loans, whether concluded or not, cannot be obligated in a procurement contract without a prior appropriation from Congress.
The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing the public respondents, advances two arguments to justify the absence of appropriation for the ZTE Supply Contract.  First, there is no need for an appropriation by law because the loan agreement has not been concluded.  Second, the automatic appropriation for payment of foreign loans under Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 1177
[19]
 provides the appropriation cover to fund the ZTE Supply Contract.  Thus, the OSG asserts:
At the outset, there is no need yet for a budget allocation as the loan agreement has yet to be concluded.  Assuming 
arguendo
 that one has already been executed, the appropriation therefor is covered by the Executive branch's power of automatic appropriation for payment of foreign loans contracted.  x x x
[20]
The OSG's first argument is an admission that when the ZTE Supply Contract was signed, there was no loan agreement, no loan proceeds, and no appropriation from Congress for the contract.  This only drives the last nail deeper into the coffin of the ZTE Supply Contract because the absence of an appropriation from Congress makes the signing of the ZTE Supply Contract an unconstitutional  and unlawful act.
The OSG's second argument betrays a lack of understanding of appropriations for payment of goods and services as distinguished from appropriations for repayment of loans. When the Executive branch secures a loan to fund a procurement of goods or services, the loan proceeds enter the National Treasury as part of the general funds of the government. Congress must appropriate by law the loan proceeds to fund the procurement of goods or services, otherwise the loan proceeds cannot be spent by the Executive branch.  When the loan falls due, Congress must make another appropriation law authorizing the repayment of the loan out of the general funds in the National Treasury.
[21]  
This appropriation for the 
repayment of the loan
 is what is covered by the automatic appropriation in Section 31 of PD No. 1177.
[22]
  It is not the appropriation needed to fund a procurement contract.   The OSG's arguments are clearly misplaced.
Absence of Public Bidding
The Government Procurement Reform Act requires public bidding in 
all procurement 
of infrastructure, goods and services. Section 10, Article IV of the Government Procurement Reform Act provides:
Section 10. Competitive Bidding - 
All procurement shall be done through Competitive Bidding
, except as provided for in Article XVI of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)
In addition, Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act provides that the Act applies to government procurement "regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign."  Hence, the requirement of public bidding applies to foreign-funded contracts like the ZTE Supply Contract.
Respondents admit that there was no public bidding for the ZTE Supply Contract. Respondents do not claim that the ZTE Supply Contract falls under any of the exceptions to public bidding in Article XVI of the Government Procurement Reform Act.   Instead, private respondent ZTE Corporation claims that the ZTE Supply Contract, 
being part of an executive agreement
, is exempt from public bidding under the last sentence of Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act.  Thus, private respondent ZTE Corporation argues:
x x x Section 4 of RA 9184 itself expressly provides that executive agreements that deal on subject matters covered by said law shall be observed. Hence, the requirement of competitive bidding under section 10 of the law is not applicable. Section 4 of RA 9184 provides:
Section 4. Scope and Application. -  This Act shall apply to the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138.  
Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed
.
x x x
There is no provision in the Executive Agreement that requires the conduct of competitive public bidding before the award of the NBN Project, or any project envisioned in the RP-China MNOU for that matter.  The subsequent exchange of notes between 
China
 and the 
Philippines
 clearly shows that ZTE was chosen as the contractor for the NBN Project. This was formalized through the DTI-ZTE MOU and the ZTE Supply Contract
.
  (Boldfacing and underlining in the original)
Private respondent ZTE Corporation's argument will hold water if an executive agreement can amend the mandatory statutory requirement of public bidding in the Government Procurement Reform Act.  In short, the issue turns on the 
novel question 
of whether an executive agreement can amend or repeal a prior law.   The obvious answer is that an executive agreement cannot amend or repeal a prior law.
Admittedly, an executive agreement has the force and effect of law, just like implementing rules of executive agencies.  However, just like implementing rules of executive agencies, executive agreements cannot amend or repeal prior laws but must comply with the laws they implement.
[23]
  Only a treaty, upon ratification by the Senate, acquires the status of a municipal law. Thus, a treaty may amend or repeal a prior law and 
vice-versa.
[24]  
Hence, a treaty may change state policy embodied in a prior law.
In sharp contrast, an executive agreement, being an exclusive act of the Executive branch, does not have the status of a municipal law.  Acting alone, the Executive has no law-making power. While the Executive does possess rule-making power, such power must be exercised consistent with the law it seeks to implement.
Consequently, an executive agreement cannot amend or repeal a prior law. An executive agreement must comply with state policy embodied in existing municipal law.   This Court has declared:
International agreements involving political issues or changes of national policy and those involving international arrangements of a permanent character usually take the form of treaties.   
But international agreements embodying adjustments of detail carrying out well-established national policies and traditions and those involving arrangements of a more or less temporary nature usually take the form of executive agreements
.
[25]
   (Emphasis supplied)
Executive agreements are intended to carry out 
well-established national policies
, and these are found in statutes.
In the United States, from where we adopted the concept of executive agreements, the prevailing view is that 
executive agreements
[26]
 cannot alter existing law but must conform with all statutory requirements
.  The U.S. State Department has explained the distinction between treaties and executive agreements in this manner:
x x x it may be desirable to point out here the well-recognized distinction between an executive agreement and a treaty.  In brief, it is that 
the former cannot alter the existing law and must conform to all statutory enactments
, whereas a treaty, if ratified by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate, as required by the Constitution, itself becomes the supreme law of the land and takes precedence over any prior statutory enactments.
[27]
  (Emphasis supplied)
As Professor Erwin Chemerinsksy states, "So long as the (U.S.) president is not violating another constitutional provision or a federal statute, there seems little basis for challenging the constitutionality of an executive agreement."
[28]
 In the United States, while an executive agreement cannot alter a federal law, an executive agreement prevails over state law.
[29]
Likewise, Professor Laurence H. Tribe states that an executive agreement cannot override a prior act of Congress even as it prevails over state law. Thus:
x x x Although it seems clear that an unratified  executive agreement, unlike a treaty, cannot override a prior act of Congress, executive agreements, even without Senate ratification, have the same weight as formal treaties in their effect upon conflicting state laws.
[30]
Professor Tribe cited 
United States v. Gary W. Capps, Inc
.,
[31]
 where the Court of Appeals (4
th
 Circuit) ruled that an unratified executive agreement could not prevail over a conflicting federal law.  The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court's decision but on non-constitutional grounds.
Clearly, an executive agreement must comply with well-established state policies, and these state policies are laid down in statutes. The Government Procurement Reform Act has laid down a categorical state policy - "
All procurement shall be done through Competitive Bidding
," subject only to narrowly defined exceptions that respondents do not invoke here.  Consequently, the executive agreement between China and the Philippines cannot exempt the ZTE Supply Contract from the state policy of public bidding.
Private respondent ZTE Corporation further claims that the ZTE Supply Contract is part of the executive agreement between China and the Philippines. This is plain error.   An executive agreement is an agreement 
between governments
.  The Executive branch has defined an "international agreement," which includes an executive agreement, to refer to a contract or an understanding "
entered
 
into between the Philippines and another government
."
[32]
That the Chinese Government handpicked the ZTE Corporation to supply the goods and services to the Philippine Government does not make the ZTE Supply Contract an executive agreement.  ZTE Corporation is not a government or even a government agency performing governmental or developmental functions like the Export-Import Bank of China or the Japan Bank for International Cooperation,
[33]
 or a multilateral lending agency organized by governments like the World Bank.
[34]
  ZTE Corporation is a business enterprise performing purely commercial functions. ZTE Corporation is publicly listed in the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with individual and juridical stockholders that receive dividends from the corporation.
Moreover, an executive agreement is governed by international law.
[35]
   However, the ZTE Supply Contract expressly provides that it shall be governed by Philippine law.
[36]
 Thus, the ZTE Supply Contract is not an executive agreement but simply a commercial contract, which must comply with public bidding as mandated by the governing law, which is Philippine law.
Finally, respondents seek refuge in the second sentence of Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act:
Section 4. Scope and Application - This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of the source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches of the government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or-controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138.  
Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed
.
   (Emphasis supplied)
Respondents argue that the second sentence of Section 4 allows an executive agreement to override the mandatory public bidding in Section 10 of the Government Procurement Reform Act.
Respondents' argument is flawed.  First, an executive agreement, being  an exclusive act of the Executive branch, cannot amend or repeal a mandatory provision of law requiring public bidding in government procurement contracts.  To construe otherwise the second sentence of Section 4 would constitute an undue delegation of legislative powers to the President, making such sentence unconstitutional. There are no standards prescribed in the Government Procurement Reform Act that would guide the President in exercising such alleged delegated legislative power. Thus, the second sentence of Section 4 cannot be construed to delegate to the President the legislative power to amend or repeal mandatory requirements in the Government Procurement Reform Act.
Second, under Section 10 of the Government Procurement Reform Act, the only exceptions to mandatory public bidding are those specified in Article XVI of the Act.  These specified exceptions do not include purchases from foreign suppliers handpicked by foreign governments, or from suppliers owned or controlled by foreign governments.    Moreover, Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act mandates that the "Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, 
regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign
 x x x."
Third, the second sentence of Section 4 should be read in conjunction with Section 4 of the Foreign Borrowings Act,
[37]
 which provides:
Section 4. In the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness under this Act, 
the President of the Philippines may, when necessary, agree to waive or modify the application of any law granting preferences or imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding
, including among others, Act Numbered Four Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Nine, Commonwealth Act Numbered One Hundred Thirty-Eight, the provisions of Commonwealth Act Numbered Five Hundred Forty-One, insofar as such provisions do not pertain to constructions primarily for national defense or security purposes, Republic Act Numbered Five Thousand One Hundred Eighty-Three: Provided, however, That as far as practicable, utilization of the services of qualified domestic firms in the prosecution of projects financed under this Act shall be encouraged: Provided, further, That in case where international competitive bidding shall be conducted preference of at least fifteen per centum shall be granted in favor of articles, materials, or supplies of the growth, production or manufacture of the Philippines: 
Provided, finally, That the method and procedure in the comparison of bids shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution.
 (Emphasis supplied)
Likewise, Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act should be read in conjunction with Section 11-A of the Official Development Assistance Act of 1996:
[38]
Section 11-A. In the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness under this Act or any law, 
the President of the Philippines may, when necessary, agree to waive or modify the application of any provision of law granting preferences in connection with, or imposing restrictions on, the procurement of goods or services
: Provided, however, That as far as practicable, utilization of the services of qualified Filipino citizens or corporations or associations owned by such citizens in the prosecution of projects financed under this Act shall be prepared  on the basis of the standards set for a particular project: Provided, further, That the matter of preference in favor of articles, materials, or supplies of the growth, production or manufacture of the Philippines, including 
the method or procedure in the comparison of bids for purposes therefor, shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution
. (Emphasis supplied)
Consequently, as construed together, the executive agreements mentioned in the second sentence of Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act should refer to executive agreements on 
(1) the waiver or modification of preferences to local goods or domestic suppliers;
[39]
 (2) the waiver or modification of restrictions on international competitive bidding; and (3)
 
the method or procedure in the comparison of bids
.
The executive agreements cannot refer to the waiver of public bidding for two reasons.  
First
, the law only allows the President to "waive or modify, the application of any law x x x imposing 
restrictions
 on international competitive bidding."  The law does not authorize the President to waive entirely public bidding but only the restrictions on public bidding.  Thus, the President may 
restrict
 the public bidding to suppliers domiciled in the country of the creditor.  This is the usual modification on restrictions imposed by creditor countries. 
Second
, when the law speaks of executive agreements on the method or procedure 
in the comparison of bids
, the obvious assumption is there will be competitive bidding.  
Third
, there is no provision of law allowing waiver of public bidding outside of the well-defined exceptions in Article XVI of the Government Procurement Reform Act.
Respondents, while not raising this argument, cannot also rely on Section 1 of the Foreign Borrowings Act, which provides:
Section 1. The President of the Philippines is hereby authorized, in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, to contract such loans, credits, including supplier's credit, deferred payment arrangements, or indebtedness 
as may be necessary and upon terms and conditions as may be agreed upon
, not inconsistent with this Act, with Governments of foreign countries with whom the Philippines has diplomatic or trade relations or which are members of the United Nations, their agencies, instrumentalities or financial institutions or with reputable international organizations or non-governmental national or international lending institutions or firms extending supplier's credit deferred payment arrangements x x x .   (Emphasis supplied)
A solitary Department of Justice opinion
[40]
 has ventured that the phrase "as may be necessary and upon terms and conditions as may be agreed upon" serves as statutory basis for the President to exempt foreign-funded government procurement contracts from public bidding.  This is a mistake.   This phrase means that the President has discretion to decide the 
terms and conditions of the loan
, such as the rate of interest, the maturity period, amortization amounts, and similar matters. This phrase does not delegate to the President the legislative power to amend or repeal mandatory provisions of law like compulsory public bidding of government procurement contracts. Otherwise, this phrase would constitute undue delegation of legislative power since there are no standards that would guide the President in exercising this alleged delegated legislative power.
What governs the waiver or modification of restrictions on public bidding is Section 4-A of the Foreign Borrowings Act, which authorizes the President to, "when necessary, agree to modify the application of any law x x x imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding."  Section 4 is the specific provision of the Foreign Borrowings Act that deals with the President's authority to waive or modify restrictions on public bidding.  Section 1 of the Act does not deal with the requirement of public bidding.   Besides, if Section 1 is construed as granting the President full authority to waive or limit public bidding, Section 4 becomes a superfluous provision.
In any event, whatever doubt may have existed before has been erased by the enactment in 2003 of the Government Procurement Reform Act, which 
reformed
 the laws regulating government procurement.  The following provisions of the Act clearly prescribe the rule that government procurement contracts shall be subject to mandatory public bidding:
Section 3. Governing Principles on Government Procurement. - 
All procurement 
of the national government, its departments, bureaus, offices and agencies, including state universities and colleges, government-owned and/or controlled corporations, government financial institutions and local government units shall, in all cases, be governed by these principles:
(a)
 
Transparency
 in the procurement process x x x.
(b)
 
Competitiveness
 by extending equal opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in 
public bidding
.
x x x.
Section 4. Scope and Application. - This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, 
regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign
, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations and local government units, x x x.
Section 10. Competitive Bidding. - 
All procurement shall be done through Competitive Bidding
, except as provided for in Article XVI of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)
The only exceptions to mandatory public bidding are procurements falling under any of the narrowly defined situations in Article XVI of the Act, which respondents do not invoke.
Foreign-funded projects of the government are not exempt from public bidding despite executive agreements entered into by the Philippines with creditor countries or lending institutions.   In 
Abaya v. Ebdane
, 
Jr
.,
[41]
 the Court cited Memorandum Circular No. 104 dated 21 August 1989
[42]
 issued by the President:
x x x it is hereby clarified that foreign-assisted infrastructure projects may be exempted from the application of the pertinent provisions of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1594 relative to the method and procedure in the comparison of bids, which may be the subject of agreement between the infrastructure agency concerned and the lending institution. 
It should be made clear however that public bidding is still required and can only be waived pursuant to existing laws
.  (Italicization in the original of the Memorandum Circular; boldfacing supplied)
Executive agreements with lending institutions have never been understood to allow exemptions from public bidding.  What the executive agreements can modify are the methods or procedures in the comparison of bids, such as the adoption of the 
competitive bidding procedures or guidelines
 of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
[43]
 or the World Bank
[44]
  on the method or procedure in the evaluation or comparison of bids.  It is self-evident that these procedures or guidelines require public bidding.
Even so-called tied loans from creditor countries cannot justify exemption from public bidding although the bidders may be limited to suppliers domiciled in the creditor countries.   Such a geographic restriction on the domicile of suppliers can be the subject of an executive agreement as a modification of restrictions on international competitive bidding.  A publication issued by public respondent National Economic and Development Authority summarizes the international practice on tied loans with respect to public bidding:
The conditions imposed by the donor on the recipient with respect to ODA utilization provide another basis for differentiating ODA.  In particular, 
restriction of the geographic areas
 where procurement of goods and services are eligible for ODA funding make ODA loan/grant tied or untied with respect to source of procurement.  
Usually, bilateral ODA is tied to the donor country in terms of procurement. While competitive bidding is still practiced, qualified bidders for the supply of goods and services are confined to those firms which are owned or controlled by nationals of the donor country.
  x x x
[45]
   (Emphasis supplied)
Even for tied loans, the international practice still requires public bidding although the public bidding is restricted only among suppliers that are nationals of the creditor country.   In the present case, there was no such public bidding because the Export-Import Bank of China simply handpicked ZTE Corporation as the supplier of the goods and services to the Philippine Government.
That the funding for the ZTE Supply Contract will come from a foreign loan does not negate the rationale for public bidding.  
Filipino taxpayers will still pay for the loan with interest.
  The need to safeguard public interest against anomalies exists in all government procurement contracts, regardless of the source of funding.  Public bidding is the most effective means to prevent anomalies in the award of government contracts.  Public bidding promotes transparency and honesty in the expenditure of public funds.  Public bidding is accepted as the best means of securing the most advantageous price for the government, whether in procuring infrastructure, goods or services, or in disposing off government assets.
Even in a Build-Operate-Transfer project where the proponent provides all the capital with no government guarantee on project loans, the law requires public bidding in the form of a Swiss challenge.
[46]
  With more reason should a project financed by a tied loan to the government be subject to public bidding.  There is no sound reason why the Philippine government should allow its foreign creditor in an already tied loan to handpick the supplier of goods and services.
A tied loan, driven by a handpicked supplier, violates the principle of fair and open process in government procurement transactions.  Such a tied loan, which arbitrarily reserves a contract to a pre-determined supplier, will likely lead to anomalies.  This is contrary to the state policies enunciated in Sections 27 and 28, Article II of the Constitution:
Section 27.   The State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption.
Section 28.  Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.
ZTE Supply Contract is Void from the Beginning
Contracts expressly prohibited or declared void by law are void from the beginning.    Article 1409 of the Civil Code provides:
Article 1409. The following contracts are 
inexistent and void from the beginning
:
x x x
(7) Those 
expressly prohibited
 or 
declared void by law
.
x x x. (Emphasis supplied)
Sections 46 and 47, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 
expressly prohibit
 the entering into procurement contracts that are not funded by an appropriation law and which do not have certificates of appropriation and fund availability.  Section 48 of the same law 
expressly declares such contracts void
.   To repeat, Section 48 provides:
SECTION  48. Void Contract and Liability of Officer. â 
Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two (2) immediately preceding sections shall be void
, x x x. (Emphasis supplied)
The ZTE Supply Contract, which is not funded by an appropriation law and does not have a certificate of appropriation and fund availability, is not only void, but also void from the beginning under Article 1409 of the Civil Code.  As the Court held in 
COM
ELEC
 v. Quijano-Padilla,
[47]
 
which involved a procurement contract without the requisite appropriation law and certificate of appropriation and fund availability:
Verily, the contract, as expressly declared by law, is 
inexistent and void ab initio
.  This is to say that the proposed contract is 
without force and effect from the very beginning or from its incipiency
, as if it had never been entered into, and hence, cannot be validated either by lapse of time or ratification.   (Emphasis supplied)
A contract void from the beginning is legally non-existent.  As such, it cannot be annulled because to annul a contract assumes a voidable contract.
[48]
  A cancellation of a contract void from the beginning has no legal effect because the contract is legally non-existent. Any cancellation may simply be construed as an acknowledgment or admission that the contract is void from the beginning.  A contract void from the beginning can only be declared as such, that is, void from the beginning.
Thus, the discontinuance or cancellation of the ZTE Supply Contract by the Philippine Government, apart from being unilateral, had no legal effect and did not moot this petition.   The members of this Court have the sworn duty to uphold the system of checks and balances that is so essential to our democratic system of government.  In the present case, the members of this Court must uphold the check and balance in the appropriation and expenditure of public funds as embodied in Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution and the statutes insuring its compliance.  If our democratic institutions are to be strengthened, this Court must not shirk from its primordial duty to preserve and uphold the Constitution.
It is time to put an end to government procurement contracts, amounting to tens of billions of pesos, exceeding even the annual budget of the Judiciary, that are awarded and signed without an appropriation from Congress, and without the required public bidding.  This Court must categorically declare the ZTE Supply Contract void from the beginning.
Accordingly, I vote to 
GRANT 
 the petition and to 
DECLARE
  the ZTE Supply Contract 
VOID
 from the beginning.

Conclusion of the Loan Agreement between Export-Import Bank of China and the Department of Finance (DOF) of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines;
Legal opinion on the procurement process by the Department of Justice of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines.
The ratification by the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the People's Republic of China of the Executive Agreement evidenced by the letter dated 02 December 2006 of Chinese Ambassador Li Jinjun  to Presidential Chief of Staff Michael T.

 Article 1318 of the Civil Code provides: "There is no contract unless the following requisites concur: (1) Consent of the contracting parties;  (2) Object certain which is the subject of the contract; (3) Cause of the obligation which is established."

DISSENTING OPINION
CARPIO MORALES, 
J
.:
The majority opinion, acting on the October 26, 2007 Manifestation and Motion of the Office of the Solicitor General, resolved to dismiss the subject petitions on two grounds, namely, these petitions have become moot in light of the declaration of the President that the government would no longer pursue the ZTE-National Broadband Network project and, even assuming it were not moot, the resolution of the same involves settling factual issues which requires reception of evidence.
I respectfully dissent.
I believe these petitions warrant a decision on the merits despite the aforementioned declaration of the President.  I share Justice Carpio's opinion that these petitions should not be dismissed on the ground of mootness.  
David v. Arroyo
[1]
 instructs:
The moot and academic principle is not a magical formula that can automatically dissuade the courts in resolving a case.  Courts will decide cases, otherwise moot and academic, if: first, there is a grave violation of the Constitution; second, the exceptional character of the situation and the 
paramount public interest is involved
; third, when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of 
controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public
; and fourth, 
the case is capable of repetition yet evading review
.  (Underscoring supplied)
The reasons underlined above in 
David
 are just as applicable in the present case as they were, not only in 
David
, but also in 
Province of Batangas v. Romulo
[2]
 and 
Manalo v. Calderon
,
[3]
 where the Court similarly decided the case on the merits, 
supervening events that would have ordinarily rendered the same moot notwithstanding
.
The legal issues raised in the present case, 
by their very nature
, are just as important, if not even more so, and are as susceptible of recurrence as those involved in the above-cited cases.  These issues also call for the formulation of controlling principles for the guidance of all concerned.  That the contract subject of the present petitions has been cancelled is, therefore, not an excuse for the Court not to decide the petitions on the merits.
Respecting the second ground cited by the majority, namely, that the present petitions call for the reception of evidence and may not, for that reason, be entertained by this Court, I believe that the admissions, both explicit and implicit, of respondents in their Consolidated Comment - pointed out by Judtice Carpio in his Dissenting Opinion - suffice for this Court to render the substantial factual issues as established without need of further evidence.
For these reasons, I dissent from the Resolution of the majority dismissing the subject petitions on the therein proffered grounds.

[2]
 G.R. No. 152774.  May 27, 2004: "
Granting 
arguendo
 that, as contended by the respondents, the resolution of the case had already been overtaken by supervening events as the IRA, including the LGSEF, for 1999, 2000 and 2001, had already been released and the government is now operating under a new appropriations law, still, there is compelling reason for this Court to resolve the substantive issue raised by the instant petition.
  Supervening events, whether intended or accidental, cannot prevent the Court from rendering a decision if there is a grave violation of the Constitution.  
Even in cases where supervening events had made the cases moot, the Court did not hesitate to resolve the legal or constitutional issues raised to formulate controlling principles to guide the bench, bar and public.
"Another reason justifying the resolution by this Court of the substantive issue now before it is the rule that 
courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is "capable of repetition, yet evading review."  For the GAAs in the coming years may contain provisos similar to those now being sought to be invalidated
, and yet, the question may not be decided before another GAA is enacted.  It, thus, behooves this Court to make a categorical ruling on the substantive issue now."  (Underscoring supplied)
[3]
 G.R. No. 178920,. October 15, 2007, penned by Justice Ruben T. Reyes.  
Manalo
 involved the habeas corpus petition filed by the police officers implicated in the burning of an elementary school in Batangas at the height of the May 2007 elections.  This Court decided the case on the merits notwithstanding the recall by the PNP of the restrictive custody orders against petitioners therein.  Citing 
David v. Arroyo
, the Court ruled thus: "x x x Every bad, unusual incident where police officers figure in generates public interest and people watch what will be done or not done to them.  Lack of disciplinary steps taken against them erode public confidence in the police institution.  As petitioners themselves assert, the restrictive custody of policemen under investigation is an existing practice, hence, the issue is bound to crop up every now and then.  
The matter is capable of repetition or susceptible of recurrence.  It better be resolved now for the education and guidance of all concerned.
  (Underscoring supplied)
SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
AZCUNA, 
J
.:
I find the points raised by Justice Antonio T. Carpio in his dissenting opinion arguably sound, correct and almost unassailable as an abstract treatise in law.  Nevertheless, under the facts and pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution that defines judicial power as the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, I am of the view that the desistance from the agreement in question renders the matter academic and moot, leaving no actual controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power.  The resolution of the issue in these proceedings would, therefore, partake of the nature of an advisory opinion which this Court is not allowed to render.
Furthermore, the so-called supply or procurement contract is clearly an incomplete agreement and cannot stand alone without the companion and yet-to-be-agreed loan agreement.  As such, desistance at this stage from further pursuing the project on the part of one party effectively prevents the contract from materializing.
I, therefore, vote to 
DISMISS
 the petition for being moot and academic, without prejudice to a proper case to settle an actual controversy involving rights that are legally demandable and enforceable, if there be any, arising from the incomplete agreement.
