LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES PETITIONER, VS. RAYMUNDA MARTINEZ, RESPONDENT. 
R E S O L U T I O N




NACHURA, J.:


 Before the Court are petitioner's September 20, 2007 Motion for Reconsideration
[1]
 and November 8, 2007 Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration,
[2]
 which seek the reversal of the August 14, 2007 Decision
[3]
 in the instant case. To recall, the Court in the challenged decision denied the petition for review on 
certiorari
 and affirmed the ruling of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 83276.
Lifted from the said assailed decision are the following antecedent facts and proceedings:
After compulsory acquisition by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), on November 16, 1993, of respondent Martinez's 62.5369-hectare land in 
Barangay
 Agpudlos, San Andres, Romblon, pursuant to Republic Act No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 (CARL), petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) offered P1,955,485.60 as just compensation. Convinced that the proffered amount was unjust and confiscatory, respondent rejected it. Thus, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), through its Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) conducted summary administrative proceedings for the preliminary determination of just compensation in accordance with Section 16 (d) of the CARL.
On September 4, 2002, PARAD Virgilio M. Sorita, finding some marked inconsistencies in the figures and factors made as bases by LBP in its computation, rendered judgment as follows:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:
Ordering the Land Bank of the Philippines to pay landowner-protestant RAYMUNDA MARTINEZ for her property covered and embraced by TCT No. T-712 with an area of 
62.5369 hectares,
 more or less, which the Department of Agrarian Reform intends to acquire, the total amount of TWELVE MILLION ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO and 50/100 Pesos (Php12,179,492.50), in the manner provided for by law.
SO ORDERED.
A petition for the fixing of just compensation docketed as Agrarian Case No. 696 was then filed by LBP's counsel before the Special Agrarian Court (SAC), the Regional Trial Court of Odiongan, Romblon, Branch 82. After filing her answer to the said petition, respondent, contending that the orders, rulings and decisions of the DARAB become final after the lapse of 15 days from their receipt, moved for the dismissal of the petition for being filed out of time. Petitioner opposed the motion.
Meanwhile, respondent, still asserting the finality of PARAD Sorita's decision, filed before the Office of the PARAD a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution, which was eventually granted on November 11, 2003.  Ascertaining that the petition before the SAC was filed by LBP 26 days after it received a copy of PARAD Sorita's decision, the Office of the PARAD denied LBP's motion for reconsideration and ordered the issuance of a writ of execution on February 23, 2004. Aggrieved of these developments, LBP, on March 12, 2004, moved to quash the said February 23, 2004 PARAD resolution.
On April 6, 2004, even as the motion to quash was yet unresolved, LBP instituted a petition for 
certiorari
 before the CA, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 83276, assailing both the November 11, 2003 and the February 23, 2004 PARAD resolutions. LBP primarily contended that the Office of the PARAD gravely abused its discretion when it issued the writ of execution despite the pendency with the SAC of a petition for the fixing of just compensation.
The CA, finding LBP guilty of forum-shopping for not disclosing the pendency of the 
Motion to Quash
 dated March 12, 2004, dismissed the petition on September 28, 2004, thus:
ACCORDINGLY, the present petition for certiorari is DISMISSED outright.
Consequently, in view of the dismissal of the above-entitled case, we are no longer in a position to act on the private respondent's motion for execution pending appeal.
Further, this Court, mindful that under Sec. 5, Rule 7, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, willful and deliberate forum-shopping constitutes direct contempt of court and cause for administrative sanctions, which may both be resolved and imposed in the same case where the forum shopping is found, WARNS the counsel of record of the petitioner that a repetition of a similar act of submitting a false certification shall be dealt with most severely.
SO ORDERED.
Not persuaded by LBP's motion for reconsideration, the appellate court denied the same on July 15, 2005. Necessarily, LBP, through its legal department, elevated the case before this Court on September 9, 2005 via a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45, contending, among others, that it did not commit deliberate forum shopping for what it filed with the Office of the PARAD was a motion to quash, which is not an initiatory pleading; and the decision of the PARAD cannot be executed due to the pending petition for fixing of just compensation with the SAC.
On September 14, 2005, we issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) restraining the appellate court and the DAR adjudicators from implementing the November 11, 2003 and the February 23, 2004 resolutions.
For her part, respondent contends that petitioner has committed forum-shopping when it filed a 
certiorari 
petition without first awaiting the resolution by the Office of the PARAD of the motion to quash; and that petitioner has lost its standing to sue considering that it is being represented by its lawyers and not the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). [Citations omitted.]
[4]
Three primordial issues were then resolved by the Court in the said decision--(1) whether or not petitioner could file its appeal solely through its legal department; (2) whether or not petitioner committed forum shopping; and (3) whether or not the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) gravely abused his discretion when he issued a writ of execution despite the pendency of LBP's petition for fixing of just compensation with the Special Agrarian Court (SAC).
The Court went on to rule that the petition for review on 
certiorari 
could not be filed without the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) entering its appearance as the principal legal counsel of the bank or without the OGCC giving its conformity to the LBP Legal Department's filing of the petition. The Court also found petitioner to have forum-shopped when it moved to quash the PARAD resolutions and at the same time petitioned for their annulment via 
certiorari
 under Rule 65. Most importantly, the Court ruled that petitioner was not entitled to the issuance of a writ of 
certiorari
 by the appellate court because the Office of the PARAD did not gravely abuse its discretion when it undertook to execute the September 4, 2002 decision on land valuation. The said adjudicator's decision attained finality after the lapse of the 15-day period stated in Rule XIII, Section 11 of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) Rules of Procedure.
Dissatisfied with our ruling, petitioner successively filed, as aforesaid, the September 20, 2007 Motion for Reconsideration
[5]
 and the November 8, 2007 Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration.
[6]
 In both motions, petitioner contends that its lawyers are authorized to appear in the instant case for they have been issued a letter of authority by the OGCC on April 17, 2006; that it did not commit deliberate forum shopping; that the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) gravely abused his discretion in issuing the writ of execution to implement his decision; that respondent's defense of 
res judicata
 or the alleged finality of the PARAD's decision was never pleaded in her answer, hence, was already deemed waived; that the PARAD had no jurisdiction to issue the writ of execution due to the pending petition for determination of just compensation with the SAC; and that the Court's August 14, 2007 Decision in this case is contrary to its October 11, 2007 Decision in 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Suntay, G.R. No. 157903
 on the issue of whether the petition for determination of just compensation was filed out of time.
Respondent, in her January 24, 2008 Comment,
[7]
 counters, among others, that the filing of the said motions is only dilatory considering that the arguments raised therein have already been answered by the Court in the decision sought to be reconsidered.
The Court agrees with respondent's contention and denies petitioner's motions.
Indeed, except for the alleged conflict of the August 14, 2007 Decision with that promulgated on October 11, 2007 in G.R. No. 157903 [
LBP v. Suntay
], the grounds raised by petitioner in the motions are identical to those stated in its previous pleadings. And these have already been considered and sufficiently passed upon by the Court in the August 14, 2007 Decision.
On the supposedly conflicting pronouncements in the cited decisions, the Court reiterates its ruling in this case that the 
agrarian reform adjudicator's decision on land valuation attains finality after the lapse of the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules
. The petition for the fixing of just compensation should therefore, following the law and settled jurisprudence, be filed with the SAC within the said period. This conclusion, as already explained in the assailed decision, is based on the doctrines laid down in 
Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals
[8]
 
and 
Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board v. Lubrica
.
[9]
In 
Philippine Veterans Bank
, decided in 2000 through the pen of Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, the Court ruled that the trial court correctly dismissed the petition for the fixing of just compensation because it was filed beyond the 15-day period provided in the DARAB Rules.
In 
Lubrica
, decided in 2005 through the pen of Justice Dante O. Tinga, the Court, citing 
Philippine Veterans Bank
, ruled that the adjudicator's decision had already attained finality because LBP filed the petition for just compensation beyond the 15-day reglementary period. Incidentally, Josefina Lubrica is the assignee of Federico Suntay whose property is the subject of the aforementioned October 11, 2007 Decision in 
LBP v.
 
Suntay
.
Following settled doctrine, we ruled in this case that the PARAD's decision had already attained finality because of LBP's failure to file the petition for the fixing of just compensation within the 15-day period.
This ruling, however, as correctly pointed out by petitioner, runs counter to the Court's recent decision in 
Suntay
 [the motions for reconsideration in 
Suntay
 were denied with finality in the January 30, 2008 Resolution of the Court
[10]
], in which the Court ruled that the trial court 
erred
 in dismissing the petition for determination of just compensation on the ground that it was filed out of time. The Court in that case stressed that the petition was not an appeal from the adjudicator's final decision but an original action for the determination of just compensation.
We, however, promulgated our decision in this case ahead of 
Suntay
. To reiterate, this case
 
was decided on August 14, 2007, while 
Suntay
 was decided two months later, or on October 11, 2007. 
Suntay 
should have then remained 
consistent
 with our ruling, and with the doctrines enunciated in 
Philippine Veterans Bank 
and in 
Lubrica
, especially considering that Lubrica was the representative of Suntay in the 
Suntay 
case.
The Court notes that the 
Suntay
 ruling is based on 
Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals
,
[11]
 decided in 1996 also through the pen of Justice Vicente V. Mendoza. In that case, the Court emphasized that the jurisdiction of the SAC is original and exclusive, not appellate. 
Republic
, however, was decided at a time when Rule XIII, Section 11 was not yet present in the DARAB Rules. Further, 
Republic
 did not discuss whether the petition filed therein for the fixing of just compensation was filed out of time or not. The Court merely decided the issue of whether cases involving just compensation should first be appealed to the DARAB before the landowner can resort to the SAC under Section 57 of R.A. No. 6657.
To resolve the conflict in the rulings of the Court, we now declare herein, for the guidance of the bench and the bar, that the better rule is that stated in 
Philippine Veterans Bank
, reiterated in 
Lubrica
 and in the August 14, 2007 Decision in this case. Thus, 
while a petition for the fixing of just compensation with the SAC is 
not an appeal from the agrarian reform adjudicator's decision but an original action
, 
the same has to be filed within the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules
; 
otherwise, the adjudicator's decision will attain finality
. This rule is not only in accord with law and settled jurisprudence but also with the principles of justice and equity. Verily, a belated petition before the SAC, e.g., one filed a month, or a year, or even a decade after the land valuation of the DAR adjudicator, must not leave the dispossessed landowner in a state of uncertainty as to the true value of his property.
IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS
, the Court 
DENIES
 
WITH FINALITY
 petitioner's September 20, 2007 Motion for Reconsideration and the November 8, 2007 Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration.
