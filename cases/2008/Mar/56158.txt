Three informations â Criminal Case Nos. 98-627, for 
attempted
 murder; 98-628, for 
frustrated
 murder; and 98-629, for 
murder
 â were filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Misamis Oriental against herein brother-appellants Edgardo Malolot (Edgardo) and Elmer Malolot (Elmer). The victims in the cases are siblings and minors all.
The information in Criminal Case No. 98-627 (for Attempted Murder) alleged that:
xxx xxx xxx
On June 23, 1998, at about 6:30 o'clock [sic] in the evening, at Barangay Himaya, El Salvador, Misamis Oriental which is within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and 
with treachery
, conspiring, confederating with and mutually helping each other and each armed with a bolo with which they previously provided themselves, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attack, assault, and hack with said bolos one 
Jovelyn Mabelin, 7 years old,
 thereby inflicting a wound on the right scapular area of said victim. Thus, the accused had commenced the commission of a felony directly by overt acts but did not perform all the acts of execution which would have produced the felony of murder because they thought that the victim was already dead.
The following aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the crime, namely:
1. The crime was committed in the 
dwelling
 of the victim;
2. The crime was committed with 
insult or in disregard of the respect due the victim on the account of [her] age

 (Underscoring in the original; emphasis supplied)
xxx xxx xxx
The three cases were tried jointly:
From the records of the cases, the following version of the prosecution is culled:
[5]
In the afternoon of June 23, 1998, while Bernadette Mabelin (Bernadette) was in the kitchen of her house, her eight-year-old daughter Juvy Mabelin (Juvy) and her playmate Teroy, appellant Elmer's son, startled her, drawing her to whip the kids.
The whipping spawned a heated argument between appellant Elmer's wife Myrna on one hand, and Bernadette and her husband Jerusalem Mabelin (Jerusalem) on the other.
Getting wind of the incident, appellant Elmer accosted Jerusalem at the latter's yard and threatened him, telling him, "Brad, this bolo which is yours, I will use this in killing you,"
[6]
 and almost simultaneously hacking Jerusalem's left forearm and fingers. Jerusalem retaliated by hacking Elmer on the left cheek with a bolo. In the meantime, Elmer's brother-co-appellant Edgardo repaired to the scene and boxed Jerusalem, drawing the latter to hack Edgardo on the forehead.
Jerusalem thereafter went up his house and got a scythe.
[7]
 On his way back, Delia Malolot (Delia), the aunt of appellants who had heard the commotion, intercepted Jerusalem and brought him to the office of the 
barangay
 captain.
Edgardo later got a bolo from his house and on his return, seeing seven-year-old Jovelyn Mabelin (Jovelyn), another daughter of Jerusalem and Bernadette who was, together with her sister Juvy, fleeing the scene of the incident, boxed, kicked, and hacked Jovelyn on the shoulder. As Edgardo's bolo fell, Jovelyn and Juvy hastily entered the nearby house of Concepcion Abragan (Concepcion) who brought them inside a room, covered them with a towel, and advised them to keep still.
Edgardo pursued Juvy and Jovelyn and tried to enter the house of Concepcion but the door was locked. Concepcion then told Edgardo to pray, telling him that he was being "possessed by a devil,"
[8]
 to which Edgardo replied, "Since I was already wounded I might as well kill a person."
[9]
 As Edgardo was trying to force his way inside Concepcion's house, Elmer's wife arrived and told him to spare the little girls.
Elmer, his wife, and Edgardo thereafter proceeded to Bernadette's and Jerusalem's house where Edgardo hacked the couple's four-year-old son Junbert outside the doorway, hitting Junbert's right eye. Still incensed, Elmer and Edgardo hacked Bernadette's 11-month-old son Jonathan who was by the rail of the doorway.
Elmer and Edgardo were later arrested as Jerusalem, Jovelyn, Junbert, and Jonathan were brought to a hospital.
Seven-year-old Jovelyn sustained a wound on her right shoulder blade.
[10]
Eleven-month-old Jonathan died on arrival at the hospital. His death certificate showed that his body bore an "incised wound 11 cm. from nasal-facial area to zygomatic end with zygomatic bone fracture left [an] incised wound 11 cm. near circumferential area left shoulder with completely cut humeral head,"
[11]
 and that the immediate cause of his death was "insanguination"
[12]
 or loss of blood.
The right eye of four-year-old Junbert was permanently damaged,
[13]
 and the doctor who treated him opined that he could have died were it not for the timely medical assistance.
[14]
Elmer, denying the accusations, gave the following version
:
As his wife and Bernadette were arguing, he intervened. Both women kept quiet. Jerusalem remarked, however, that he would break their heads
[15]
 and soon hit him on his left face with a bolo. He retaliated by hitting the forearm of Jerusalem with a bolo. Edgardo tried to pacify him and Jerusalem, but the latter also hacked Edgardo on the forehead.
Jerusalem thereupon ran towards his house, and Edgardo pursued him (Jerusalem). He (Elmer) soon heard Bernadette shout that a child was hit and saw her descending the stairs of her house carrying a wounded child.
Policemen brought Elmer and Edgardo to a center for medical treatment after which they were brought to the municipal hall for preliminary investigation.
[16]
On Edgardo's part
,
[17]
 
he gave the following version
:
In the evening of June 23, 1998, while he was inside his house, he heard a man and a woman shouting at each other. He thus proceeded to the site of the commotion and tried to pacify the quarrelling parties. He boxed Jerusalem in the chest, and in turn, Jerusalem hacked him with a bolo. Jerusalem thereafter left. In the meantime, he heard Bernadette shout that somebody was wounded. He then left for home and on his way, he met his father who gave him a 
bolo
. He thereafter "went to the lawn of Concepcion Abragan and went wild"
[18]
 because he was only pacifying the quarreling parties but ended up being hacked by Jerusalem.
[19]
 Thus, in his rage, he cut Concepcion's 
talisay
 tree and destroyed the fence of her house, without "noticing" that he had wounded Jerusalem's children in the process.
Branch 18 of the Misamis Oriental RTC convicted appellants by Decision
[20]
 of October 16, 2001, disposing as follows:

The records of the cases were forwarded for automatic review
[22]
 to this Court which in turn forwarded them to the Court of Appeals for intermediate review
[23]
 pursuant to 
People v. Mateo
.
[24]
In his brief,
[25]
 Elmer raised the following as errors of the trial court:
I
... FINDING THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY ON THE PART OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT ELMER MALOLOT AND HIS BROTHER EDGARDO MALOLOT IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIMES CHARGED.

Edgardo raised the following errors of the trial court:
I
... GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE INCONSISTENT TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS BERNADETTE MABELIN. 
II
... CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT EDGARDO MALOLOT OF THE CRIMES CHARGED DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. 
III
... CONSIDERING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY
.
[27]
 
(Emphasis in the original)
By Decision
[28]
 of May 23,2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction of Elmer and Edgardo, but 
added an award of exemplary damages for the Attempted Murder of Jovelyn. and reduced the civil indemnity for the death of Jonathan
 from P75,000 to P50,000. Thus the appellate court disposed:
WHEREFORE, the October 16, 2001 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental, 10
th
 Judicial Region, Branch 18, Cagayan de Oro City is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
, as follows:

In Crim. Case No. 98-629 the amount of indemnity for the death of Jonathan is reduced to-P50,000.00.
SO ORDERED.
[29]
 (Emphasis in the original)
The cases were thereupon returned to this Court.
[30]
 The Solicitor General manifested
[31]
 its intention not to file a Supplemental Brief and to adopt its Brief for the Appellee
[32]
 filed before the Court of Appeals.
In their Supplemental Brief,
[33]
 Elmer and Edgardo contended that:
THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
[34]
xxx xxx xxx
ASSUMING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS ARE GUILTY, THEY SHOULD BE CONVICTED FOR ATTEMPTED 
HOMICIDE
, FRUSTRATED 
HOMICIDE
, AND 
HOMICIDE
 ONLY.
[35]
xxx xxx xxx
ASSUMING FURTHER THAT TREACHERY WAS EMPLOYED IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIMES CHARGED, THE APPELLATE COURT ERRED IN APPLYING THE SAME TO BOTH OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.
[36]
 (Underscoring supplied)
Appellants assail Bernadette's credibility due to alleged inconsistencies in her testimony in that:
xxx [djuring direct examination. [Bernadette] testified that after the two (2) accused hacked her two (2) sons, she immediately went to her elder sister. However on cross-examination, she testified that after seeing her two (2) sons being hacked by the two (2) accused, she immediately lost consciousness and regained the same only after the police arrived at the scene.
[37]
Appellants also claim that Bernadette's testimony that Concepcion was present during the hacking of Jonathan and Junbert was contradicted by Concepcion who denied the same.
[38]
Findings and conclusions of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses enjoy, as a rule, a badge of respect, for trial courts have the advantage of observing the demeanor of witnesses as they testify.
[39]
 Appellants have not, however, cited material facts that might have been overlooked by the trial court to affect the outcome of the cases.
The inconsistencies in the testimony of Bernadette on what transpired after the hacking of her sons, and her testimony that Concepcion was present during the said hacking which was denied by Concepcion, do not diminish Bernadette's credibility, as they pertain to peripheral matters which do not dent the proven elements of the crimes.
[40]
As for appellants' denial of the existence of conspiracy, while the finding of conspiracy with respect to the 
frustrated murder of Junbert
 is sustained, that with respect to the 
attempted murder of Jovelyn
 is not.
Elmer did not participate in hacking Jovelyn. From Concepcion's testimony, Elmer was in the same place where he happened to be when Edgardo boxed Jerusalem.
[41]
 While Elmer did not restrain Edgardo, there is no sufficient evidence that Elmer, by his presence, provided moral assistance to Edgardo as the latter hacked Jovelyn.
Conspiracy requires the same degree of proof required to establish the crime â proof beyond reasonable doubt.
[42]
 Mere presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission without proof of cooperation or agreement to cooperate is not enough to constitute one a party to a conspiracy.
[43]
To the Court, however, Edgardo's hacking of 
Junbert
 and the 
fatal hacking of Jonathan
 were motivated by his and Elmer's common unlawful purpose. The following circumstances indicate so:
Elmer entered Bernadette and Jerusalem's house, together with Edgardo, shortly after the latter was frustrated from entering Concepcion's house where she hid Jovelyn and Juvy;
[44]
Elmer's hacking of Jonathan was simultaneous to or immediately after Edgardo's hacking of Junbert;
[45]
 and
Following the hacking of both Jonathan and Junbert, one of appellants remarked that 
they
 had already taken 
their
 revenge.
[46]
On appellant's taking issue on the presence of treachery, the Court does not find well-taken the following contention of Elmer and Edgardo:
[T]he prosecution failed to present evidence that the accused-appellants 
have resolved
 to commit the crime prior to the moment of the commission of the crimes charged. There was no proof that the consummation of the alleged crimes was the result of meditation, calculation or reflection.
To sustain a finding of treachery, the means, method or form of attack must be shown to have been deliberately adopted by the appellant.
[47] 
(Underscoring in original)
There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, 
without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make
.
[48]
When an adult illegally attacks a child, treachery exists even if the mode of attack is not proved by the prosecution because a child of tender years could not be expected to put up a defense, hence, is at the mercy of the assailant.
[49]
 That the victims of the Attempted Murder, Frustrated Murder and Murder â Jovelyn, Junbert and Jonathan, respectively â were minors at the time of the incident has been proven.
[50]
The allegation in each of the three informations of disregard of the age of the victim cannot, however, be appreciated as an additional aggravating circumstance in the commission of the crimes as the same is absorbed in the qualifying circumstance of treachery.
[51]
 That leaves dwelling in the frustrated murder of Junbert and the murder of Jonathan as the aggravating circumstance in the commission thereof.
In view of the enactment on June 24, 2006 of Republic Act 9346 prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, however, the imposable penalty for the murder of Jonathan is reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[52]
WHEREFORE
, the May 23, 2006 decision of the Court of Appeals is 
AFFIRMED
