SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 149377, March 25, 2008 ]


JESUS CLARITO ESPIÃA, PETITIONER, V.S. MIGUEL CERUJANO, ALFREDA TINGKINGCO, AND SENENCIO CERUJANO, JR., RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:






In Criminal Case No. 1276, for Robbery in 
Band with Multiple Homicide,
 Branch 22 of the Lao-ang, Northern Samar Regional Trial Court convicted as charged all the accused therein, except a certain Matea Infante, and imposed upon them the death penalty.
[1]


On automatic review of the case, this Court affirmed the conviction but commuted the penalty to reclusion perpetua.
[2] 
The decision became final and executory on May 7, 1987.
[3]


On June 14, 1993, petitioner, Jesus Clarito EspiÃ±a (sometimes spelled as Espina), a Prosecutor of the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Lao-ang, Northern Samar, filed a Motion to Dismiss Criminal Case No. 1276 on the ground that the Anti-Subversion Law had been repealed.
[4]
  On even date, the trial court granted petitionerâs motion and accordingly dismissed Criminal Case No. 1276.
[5]


Respondents, Miguel Cerujano, Alfreda Tingkingco, and Senencio Cerujano, Jr., thus filed an administrative complaint for
 conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service
 against petitioner before the Department of Justice (DOJ), contending that:




x x x The 
grounds relied upon
 by Public Prosecutor Jesus Clarito L. Espina
 
ha[ve] nothing to do with the case
 at all, as the case decided with finality by the Court is 
Robbery in Band with Multiple Homicide 
and not a violation of the Anti-Subversion Law as advanced in the Motion to Dismiss.
  By his acts, Public Prosecutor Jesus Clarito L. Espina, aside from showing his ignorance of the law and the Rules of Court, had maligned the good image of the Public Attorneyâs Office and the Department of Justice. 



Further, despite the hibernation of RTC Lao-ang, Northern Samar by 
not executing the decision on the said case despite the lapse of several years since its receipt of the records of the case,
 in a rather doubtful Order, issued the very day the Motion to Dismiss was filed, Hon. Judge Mateo M. Leanda of RTC Branch XII, Lao-ang, Northern Samar, dismissed the case on the basis of the Motion to Dismiss filed by Public Prosecutor Jesus Clarito L. Espina, without even giving the complaining witnessâ party a notice much less a day in Court to comment or to present its side which is a blatant and grave violation of due process. x x x


As a consequence of the orchestrated acts of RTC Branch XXII of Lao-ang, Northern Samar and Public Prosecutor Jesus Clarito L. Espina, the accused who were responsible for the death of at least four persons, robbery of properties worth P179,115.00 and of inflicting bodily harm o[n] many other persons, for which they were sentenced with finality to a penalty of death which was commuted to Reclusion Perpetua by the Supreme Court, are now freely roaming around. x x x
[6]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




In his Answer
[7] 
to the administrative complaint, petitioner, claiming good faith, alleged that it was the trial judge, Judge Mateo M. Leanda, who asked him to file the Motion to Dismiss upon the repeal of the Anti-Subversion Law and pursuant to DOJ Memorandum Circular No. 10 mandating all government prosecutors to file the proper motions to dismiss Anti-Subversion Law criminal cases.
[8]


Petitioner further alleged that while he informed the trial judge that the accused had been convicted of Robbery with Multiple Homicide, and not of violating the Anti-Subversion Law, the judge assured him that the Motion to Dismiss âwould not touch on the case of Robbery with Multiple Homicide x x x but only on the Anti-Subversion [L]awâ;
[9]
 that on his request, the judge prepared and handed to him the Motion to Dismiss on which he (petitioner) affixed his signature; and that he was not in fact informed of the order dismissing the case and came to know of it only when he received the administrative complaint against him.
The Secretary of Justice later formally charged petitioner with 
conduct grossly prejudicial to the [best] interest of the service.
[10]
During the formal investigation of the case, petitioner claimed that he

x x x Criminal Case No. 1276 [was] covered by Memorandum Circular No. 10 notwithstanding the fact that the accused in that criminal case were charged and convicted of âROBBERY IN BAND WITH MULTIPLE HOMICIDEâ.  The AMENDED INFORMATION  xxx filed on July 08, 19[8]1 and the SENTENCE rendered on March 21, 1986 xxx obviously 
show that all the accused were 
members of the NEW PEOPLEâS ARMY [NPA]
 judicially known as the armed group of the COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES outlawed by the Anti-Subversion Law (RA 1700).

After investigation, the Secretary of Justice found petitioner liable for 
grave misconduct
 and recommended  to the President his dismissal from the service with the corresponding accessory penalties.
[14]


On March 30, 1999, President Estrada issued Administrative Order No. 62
[15]
 dismissing petitioner from the service.
Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[16]
 arguing, at all events, that he was entitled to a mitigation of the penalty considering that the offense was his first in his 33 years of government service.  His motion was denied.


Petitioner thus filed a Petition for Review
[17]
 before the Court of Appeals which denied the same.
[18]


On petitionerâs plea for the mitigation of his penalty, the Court of Appeals held:




. . . [T]his contention of the petitioner is wrong considering that 
his questioned act is not covered by Section 23(t) Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules, an act prejudicial to the interest of service, because 
actually, petitioner was found guilty of grave misconduct,
 which guilt was affirmed by public respondent in his Resolution dated November 29, 1999. Thus, 
the penalty is well within the provision of Section 23 (c) of Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules in relation to Section 8, Rule XIV 
of the same Omnibus Rules, which is quoted hereunder for ready reference: 



âSEC.  23.  Administrative offenses with its corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave, and light, depending on the gravity of its nature and effects of said acts on the government service.


The following are grave offenses with its corresponding penalties.


(a)    x x x


x x x x


(c) grave misconduct (1st Offense, Dismissal) (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.).
[19]




His Motion for Reconsideration
[20] 
having been denied,
[21] 
petitioner comes to this Court via Petition for Review on Certiorari,
[22]
 arguing that he was not afforded due process because he was found guilty and penalized for grave misconduct, albeit the charge filed against him was for conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
[23]
 And he reiterates his plea for mitigation of his penalty, the offense being his first during his 33 years of government service.
[24]


During the pendency of the case or on October 6, 2004, petitioner filed with this Court a Manifestation
[25]
 stating, among other things, that he had already retired from the service.
[26]
The petition is impressed with merit.
In 
Civil Service Commission v. Lucas, 
[27]
 this Court held:




We sustain the ruling of the Court of Appeals that (a) a basic requirement of due process is that a person must be 
duly informed of the charges against him and that (b) a person can not be convicted of a crime which he was not charged.




Administrative proceedings are not exempt
 from basic and fundamental procedural principles, such as the right to due process in investigations and hearings.
[28]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)




Amplifying the above-cited ruling, this Court, in 
Civil Service Commission v. Ledesma,
[29]
 held:




x x x In [
Civil Service Commission v. Lucas
], the CSC 
found Lucas guilty of 
grave
 misconduct though the charge against him was for 
simple
 misconduct only.
  The Court held that the CSCâs verdict in
 Lucas 
violated the basic requirements of due process.  The Court ruled that 
even in an administrative proceeding Lucas had the right to 
be informed 
of the charges against him, as well as the right 
not to be convicted of an offense for which he was not charged.




Misconduct is âa transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.â  
The misconduct is grave if it involves any of the 
additional
 elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules,
 which must be established by substantial evidence.  A person charged with grave misconduct may be held liable for simple misconduct if the misconduct does not involve any of the additional elements to qualify the misconduct as grave.


Grave misconduct necessarily includes the lesser offense of simple misconduct.  A person charged with simple misconduct cannot be held liable for the more serious offense of grave misconduct because he will be deprived of his constitutional right to be informed of the charges against him.  
A charge of simple misconduct does not give him notice that he must traverse and if necessary rebut not only the charge of misconduct, but also the element of corruption or willful intent to violate
 the law or established rules.  This is the situation in the case of Civil Service Commission v. Lucas.
[30]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)




In the case at bar, petitioner cannot be held liable for grave misconduct under a charge of âconduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service.â  Conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service does not necessarily include the elements of grave misconduct.  The word 
âgrossâ
 connotes âsomething beyond measure; beyond allowance; not to be excused; flagrant; shamefulâ while
 âprejudicialâ 
means âdetrimental or derogatory to a party; naturally, probably or actually bringing about a wrong result.â
[31]


Conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service may or may not be characterized by corruption or a willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules.


Under the Civil Service law and rules, there is no concrete description of what specific acts constitute the grave offense of conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service, although this Court has considered the following acts or omissions, among others, as such:  misappropriation of public funds, abandonment of office, failure to report back to work without prior notice, failure to safe keep public  records and property, making false entries in public documents and falsification of court orders.
[32]


While grave misconduct and conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service are both grave offenses under the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, grave misconduct has a heavier penalty.  Grave misconduct is penalized by dismissal from service.
[33] 
On the other hand, conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service is penalized by dismissal from service only on the second offense; on the first offense, the penalty is suspension for six months and one day, to one year.
[34]


The record does not show that any of the additional elements to qualify the charge of conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service to grave misconduct had been established.


That petitioner signed the Motion to Dismiss upon the trial judgeâs request does not absolve him of liability, however.  As stated in the Resolution of the Office of the President denying petitionerâs motion for reconsideration, such defense âall the more rubs in the fact that respondent has no business being a prosecutor if he will merely act as a puppet for unscrupulous judges.â
[35]


It bears recalling that a public prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is that justice shall be done,
[36]
 and that the guilty shall not escape nor the innocent suffer
[37] 
As the representative of the State, the public prosecutor has the duty to take all steps to protect the rights of the People in the trial of an accused.
[38] 
That petitioner relied on the trial judgeâs assurance that the Motion to Dismiss would touch only on the Anti-Subversion Law aspect of the case betrays his ignorance.  For even if the accused therein were indeed members of the New Peopleâs Army, they were charged not for subversion but for Robbery in Band with Multiple Homicide.


Petitionerâs reliance on 
People v. Lava
 is misplaced, for the Court therein reiterated that it is 
rebellion,
 not subversion,
 which absorbs the crimes committed as means in furtherance thereof.
[39]


The penalty for conduct grossly prejudicial to best the interest of the service is, to reiterate, suspension for six months and one day to one year for the first offense, and dismissal from service for the second.


Rule XIV, Section 18 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order 292 provides:




The imposition of the penalty shall be made in accordance with the manner herein below detailed, provided the penalty attached to the offense is divisible into minimum, medium, and maximum, to wit: 



(a) The minimum of the penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present;


(b) The medium of the penalty shall be imposed where no mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present or when both are present they equally offset each other;


(c) The maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present;


(d) Where aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present, the minimum of the penalty shall be applied where there are more mitigating circumstances present; the medium period if the circumstances equally offset each other; and the maximum where there are more aggravating circumstances.




The offense committed by petitioner was his first.  And the Court considers his 33 years of service as mitigating.
[40]
  The imposition of suspension for six months and one day is thus appropriate.  Petitioner having already retired from the service, however, in lieu of suspension, the imposition of a fine equivalent to his salary for six months is in order.
[41]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
PARTIALLY GRANTED.
  The December 22, 2000 decision of the Court of Appeals is 
MODIFIED.
  Petitioner, Jesus Clarito EspiÃ±a, is found GUILTY of conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service.  Having retired during the pendency of the case, he is FINED in the amount equivalent to his salary for six months.


SO ORDERED.
