BENJAMIN B. GERONGA, Petitioner, vs. HON. EDUARDO VARELA, as City Mayor of Cadiz City, Respondent.
D E C I S I O N




AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:


The Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Benjamin B.  Geronga (petitioner) assails that portion of the October 15, 2002 Joint Decision
[1]
 of the Court Appeals (CA) affirming his dismissal from the service under Resolution No.  992107
[2]
 dated September 17, 1999 and Resolution No.  000715
[3]
 dated March 21, 2000 of the Civil Service Commission (CSC); as well as the October 1, 2003 CA Resolution
[4]
 denying his Motion for Reconsideration.
The facts are of record.
Petitioner works as Engineer IV at the General Services Department of the local government of Cadiz City.  In 1996, he was involved in two administrative cases: 1) Administrative Case No.  96-04
[5]
 for Unjust Vexation, Contempt, Insubordination, Conduct Unbecoming a Public Officer, and Alarm and Scandal; and 2) Administrative Case No.  96-05
[6]
 for Grave Misconduct and Engaging in Partisan Political Activity.  Impleaded with petitioner in Administrative Case No.  96-05 were Edwin Nuyad (Nuyad) and Nick Ambos (Ambos), also employees of the local government of Cadiz City.
The two administrative cases were referred by Cadiz City Mayor Eduardo Varela (respondent) to City Legal Officer Marcelo R.  del Pilar (Del Pilar) for investigation.  After investigation, Del Pilar issued in Administrative Case No.  96-04 a Resolution/Recommendation dated December 1, 1997 for the dismissal of petitioner for grave misconduct.
[7]
 In Administrative Case No.  96-05, Del Pilar issued a separate Resolution/Recommendation dated December 4, 1997, recommending the dismissal of petitioner, Nuyad and Ambos for grave misconduct and partisan politics.
[8]
 Respondent approved both recommendations.
[9]
Consequently, on January 8, 1998, respondent issued to petitioner Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05, addressed to petitioner, to wit:
Attached is a copy of the Resolution/Recommendation of the City Legal Officer which this office has approved in toto and considered an integral part hereof.
We find the recommendation as contained therein to be just and proper under the premises.
In view hereof, you are hereby meted a penalty of dismissal from the service as recommended effective January 09, 1998.
For strict compliance.
[10]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
Petitioner received copy of Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 on January 9, 1998.
[11]
 Without assistance of counsel, petitioner filed with the CSC a Notice of Appeal, stating:
Appellant respectfully serves notice that he is appealing his DISMISSAL FROM SERVICE by the City Mayor of Cadiz City, Negros Occidental, Eduardo G.  Varela, 
contained in the latter's Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 dated January 08, 1998.
[12]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
Still without assistance of counsel, petitioner, together with Nuyad and Ambos, filed a Joint Memorandum in which he discussed Administrative Case No.  96-05 only, and completely omitted reference to Administrative Case No.  96-04.
[13]
Acting on the appeal, the CSC issued Resolution No.  990717 dated March 25, 1999, thus:
WHEREFORE, the appeal of Edwin Nuyad, Nick Ambos and [petitioner] is hereby granted.  Accordingly, Mayor Eduardo G.  Varela is directed to reinstate Nuyad, Ambos and [petitioner] to their former positions or, if no longer available, to comparable positions.
[14]
Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration,
[15]
 questioning the order to reinstate Nuyad, Ambos and petitioner.  Respondent pointed out that petitioner cannot be reinstated anymore because the latter failed to appeal from his dismissal in Administrative Case No.  96-04, which consequently became final and executory.
The CSC partly granted the Motion for Reconsideration of respondent in Resolution No.  992107, to wit:
WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration of Mayor Eduardo G.  Varela is partly granted.
His prayer for the reversal of CSC Resolution No.  990717 dated March 25, 1999 is hereby denied.  
However, his request for the non-reinstatement of [petitioner] in view of the finality of the decision in Administrative Case No.  96-04, finding [petitioner] guilty of Grave Misconduct for which he was meted out the penalty of dismissal from the service is granted.
Accordingly, CSC Resolution No.  990717 dated March 25, 1999 is hereby modified insofar as the non-reinstatement of [petitioner] is concerned.  In all other matters, the said resolution stands.
[16]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
Both petitioner and respondent filed Motions for Reconsideration
[17]
 but the CSC denied the same in Resolution No.  000715.
[18]
 They filed with the CA separate Petitions for Review,
[19]
 which were later consolidated.
[20]
In the October 15, 2002 Joint Decision
[21]
 assailed herein, the CA dismissed both petitions and affirmed CSC Resolutions No.  992107 and No.  000715.
Only petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[22]
 which the CA denied in its October 1, 2003 Resolution.
[23]
Petitioner is now before this Court, seeking resolution of the following issues:
Whether or not the dismissal of the petitioner under Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 constitutes a denial of his constitutional right to due process;
Whether or not the petitioner was denied due process under the Resolution/Recommendation of the City Legal Officer in Adm.  Case No.  96-04 as adopted in toto by the City Mayor;
Whether or not the dismissal of the petitioner became final for failure to appeal;
Whether or not the Civil Service Commission acted properly and within the bounds of its own rules and regulations in entertaining the motion for reconsideration of Mayor Varela from its Resolution No.  990714 dated March 25, 1999; and
Whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the dismissal of the petitioner.
[24]
We shall first resolve the fourth issue â whether the CSC may entertain respondent's motion for reconsideration of its decision exonerating petitioner.
Petitioner points out that after ordering his exoneration under Resolution No.  990717, the CSC could no longer entertain a motion for reconsideration filed by respondent who is not even a proper party.  He argues that in acting upon the motion for reconsideration of respondent and worse, in modifying Resolution No.  990717, the CSC violated Section 38, Rule III, in relation to Section 2(l), Rule I of Memorandum Circular No.  19, series of 1999 or the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS); and the CA erred in affirming it.
[25]
Petitioner is mistaken.
Sections 37 (a) and 39 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No.  807,
[26]
 otherwise known as The Philippine Civil Service Law, provide:
Section 37.  â (a) The Commission shall decide upon appeal all administrative disciplinary cases involving the imposition of a penalty of suspension for more than thirty days, or fine in an amount exceeding thirty days salary, demotion in rank or salary or transfer, removal or dismissal from office x x x.
Section 39.  â (a) Appeals, where allowable, shall be made by the 
party adversely affected
 by the decision within fifteen days from receipt of the decision unless a petition for reconsideration is seasonably filed, which petition shall be decided within fifteen days x x x.  (Emphasis supplied.)
In addition, Section 47 of Executive Order (E.O.) No.  292 (The Administrative Code of 1987)
[27]
 reiterates that the CSC may entertain appeals only from (a) a penalty of suspension of more than thirty days; or (b) a fine in an amount exceeding thirty daysâ salary; or (c) demotion in rank or salary or transfer; or (d) removal or dismissal from office.
Interpreting the foregoing provisions, the Court has earlier held that, in an administrative case, only a decision involving the imposition of a penalty of suspension of more than 30 days, fine exceeding 30-day salary, demotion, transfer, removal or dismissal is appealable to the CSC; hence, a decision exonerating an employee cannot be appealed.
[28]
 Moreover, given the nature of the appealable decision, only said employee would qualify as the âparty adversely affectedâ who is allowed to appeal; other persons, such as the appointing or disciplining authorities, cannot appeal.
[29]
Consonant with the foregoing interpretation, the CSC adopted Section 2(l), Rule I and Section 38, Rule III of the URACCS
[30]
 in implementation of the pertinent
provisions of P.D.  No.  807 and E.O.  No.  292,
[31]
 to wit:
Section 2.  
Coverage and Definition of Terms.
  x x x (l) PARTY ADVERSELY AFFECTED refers to the respondent against whom a decision in a disciplinary case has been rendered.
x x x x
Section 38.  
Filing of Motion for Reconsideration
.  - The party adversely affected by the decision may file a motion for reconsideration with the disciplining authority who rendered the same within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof
The present view is different.  In a long line of cases,
[32]
 beginning with 
Civil Service Commission v.  Dacoycoy,
[33]
 this Court has maintained that a judgment of exoneration in an administrative case is appealable, and that the CSC,
[34]
 as the agency mandated by the Constitution to preserve and safeguard the integrity of our civil service system, and/or the appointing authority, such as a mayor
[35]
 who exercises the power to discipline or remove an erring employee, qualifies as parties adversely affected by the judgment who can file an appeal.  The rationale for this is explained in the concurring opinion of Associate Justice now Chief Justice Reynato S.  Puno in 
Civil Service Commission v.  Dacoycoy:
In truth, the doctrine barring appeal is not categorically sanctioned by the Civil Service Law.  For what the law declares as âfinalâ are decisions of heads of agencies involving suspension for not more than thirty (30) days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty (30) days salary x x x.  It is thus non sequitur to contend that since some decisions exonerating public officials from minor offenses can not be appealed, ergo, even a decision acquitting a government official from a major offense like nepotism cannot also be appealed.
[36]
Thus, through Resolution No.  021600,
[37]
 the CSC amended the URACCS, by allowing the disciplining authority to appeal from a decision exonerating an erring employee, thus:
Section 2.  
Coverage and Definition of Terms
.  â x x x (l) PARTY ADVERSELY AFFECTED refers to the respondent against whom a decision in a disciplinary case has been rendered or to the disciplining authority in an appeal from a decision exonerating the said employee.
In fine, the exoneration of petitioner under CSC Resolution No.  990717 may be subject to a motion for reconsideration by respondent who, as the appointing and disciplining authority, is a real party in interest.  The CSC acted within the rubric of 
Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy
 in allowing said motion for reconsideration.
The next question then is whether the CSC was correct in granting the motion for reconsideration of respondent, and the CA, in agreeing with it.
The CA and CSC declared as final and executory the decision of respondent in Administrative Case No.  96-04, finding petitioner guilty of grave misconduct and sentencing him with a penalty of dismissal from government service, on the sole ground that the latter failed to appeal from said decision.  The CSC found:
x x x It is worthy to note that a copy of the 
Decision dated December 1, 1997
 in Administrative Case No.  96-04 issued by [respondent[ was received by [petitioner] himself on January 9, 1998.  This is very apparent on the face of the Decision.  Hence, upon receipt of the same, [petitioner] had the option whether or not to bring the said decision on appeal to the Commission.  Considering that he failed to appeal the said Decision within the prescribed period of fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof, the same became final and executory.
[38]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
The CA added that the appeal which petitioner interposed from the decision in Administrative Case No.  96-05 cannot be treated also as an appeal from the decision in Administrative Case No.  96-04 because the âJoint Memorandum before the CSC mentions only Administrative Case No.  96-05, not Administrative Case No.  96-04.â
[39]
The Court does not completely agree.
The CSC is under the impression that in Administrative Case No.  96-04, respondent issued a âDecision dated December 1, 1997,â and that it is said decision which petitioner should have appealed.  The CA shared the notion.  Both are wrong.  What is dated December 1, 1997 is merely the Resolution/Recommendation issued by Del Pilar in Administrative Case No.  96-04.  The formal decision of respondent is Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 dated January 8, 1998.
There is a material difference between a mere recommendation to dismiss an employee and an administrative decision/resolution sentencing him with dismissal.
Under Section 35,
[40]
 Rule III of the URACCS, a recommendation to dismiss is that contained in a formal investigation report issued by a hearing or investigating officer and submitted to the disciplining authority for approval.  Falling under this category are the December 1, 1997 Recommendation/Resolution in Administrative Case No.  96-04 and the December 4, 1997 Recommendation/Resolution in Administrative Case No.  96-05 issued by Del Pilar as investigating officer.  While they contain the approval of respondent as disciplining authority, both Recommendations/Resolutions merely state findings of probable cause that petitioner is guilty of the administrative charges filed against him, and recommend that he be dismissed.  As we held in 
Rubio v.  Munar
,
[41]
 such recommendations are not the proper subject matter of an appeal to the CSC.
In contrast, a decision/resolution of dismissal is that rendered by the disciplining authority after receipt of the recommendation of the investigating/ hearing officer,
[42]
 and on the basis of his independent assessment of the case.
[43]
 Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 is one.  It was issued by respondent after receipt of the recommendations of Del Pilar.  While it incorporates by reference said recommendations, Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 goes further by categorically declaring petitioner guilty of the administrative charges and imposing upon him the penalty of dismissal.  It is therefore the decision rendered by respondent as disciplining authority which may be appealed or be subject of execution, if already final.
[44]
Furthermore, it bears emphasis that Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 is the decision of respondent not just in Administrative Case No.  96-05 but also in Administrative Case No.  96-04.  While the language employed in Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 refers to a singular âResolution/Recommendationâ of Del Pilar, what were actually attached to the Memorandum were the December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation in Administrative Case No.  96-04 and the December 4, 1997 Resolution in Administrative Case No.  96-05.  These attachments were served on petitioner and personally received by him on January 9, 1998 at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, at exactly the same date and time he received Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05.
[45]
Thus, Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 being the decision of respondent in both Administrative Case No.  96-04 and Administrative Case No.  96-05, it is crucial to emphasize that in the Notice of Appeal which petitioner filed, he distinctly stated that what he is appealing to the CSC is his dismissal as âcontained in [respondent's] Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 dated January 08, 1998.â
[46]
 By so doing, petitioner effectively included in his appeal not just Administrative Case No.  96-05 but also Administrative Case No.  96-04.  Therefore, respondent erred in concluding that Administrative Case No.  96-04 had become final and executory for failure of petitioner to appeal the same to the CSC.
Unfortunately for petitioner, the CA and CSC did not anymore look into the merits of the decision in Administrative Case No.  96-04 simply because he raised no issue or argument against it.
[47]
 Understandably, the CA and CSC could not be faulted for doing so; they were merely adhering to a basic rule that in any proceeding, a party who fails to cite specific grounds or raise particular arguments is deemed to have waived them.
[48]
Such rule, however, is not sacrosanct.  It yields to the imperatives of equity, which often arise in administrative cases where at stake is the security of tenure of labor, the protection of which no less than the Constitution guarantees.
[49]
 Deprivation of security of tenure may be justified only for the causes specified and in the manner prescribed by law.  Should there be doubt in the legality of either cause or mode of dismissal, public interest demands the resolution of the doubt wholly on its substance, rather than solely on technical minutiae.
[50]
In 
Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation v.  Angara,
[51]
 the respondents-employees f
ailed to appeal
 from a decision in which the CSC ordered their reinstatement but omitted to award them backwages.  The Court condoned their technical lapse and granted their belated claim so as to fulfill the guarantee of monetary compensation which the law itself extends to those arbitrarily dismissed.
Also, in Constantino-David v.  Pangandaman-Gania,
[52]
 the respondent-employee failed to question a CSC resolution which omitted to award her backwages.  
Despite said resolution having attained finality
, the Court allowed its modification so as to entitle the respondent-employee to backwages:
To prevent respondent from claiming back wages would leave incomplete the redress of the illegal dismissal that had been done to her and amount to endorsing the wrongful refusal of her employer or whoever was accountable to reinstate her.  A too-rigid application of the pertinent provisions of the 
Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service
 as well as the 
Rules of Court
 will not be given premium where it would obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice in the light of the prevailing circumstances in the case under consideration.
[53]
So too must the Court allow petitioner redress from the decision of respondent in Administrative Case No.  96-04.  While petitioner, unaided by legal counsel, may have omitted to raise specific grounds against the decision insofar as Administrative Case No.  96-04 is concerned, it cannot be denied that he intended to appeal from it.  The least he deserves then is a scrutiny of the legal and factual bases of his dismissal.
As it turns out, upon review, said decision, insofar as it relates to Administrative Case No.  96-04, is patently void.
Two fundamental requirements
[54]
 of due process in administrative cases are that a person must be duly informed of the charges against him; and that he cannot be convicted of an offense or crime with which he was not charged.
[55]
 A deviation from these requirements renders the proceeding invalid and the judgment issued therein a lawless thing that can be struck down anytime.
[56]
In the present case, the records of Administrative Case No.  96-04 reveal that petitioner was dismissed for an act which was not alleged in the administrative charge filed against him.
Administrative Case No.  96-04 sprung from a Sworn Complaint
[57]
 dated March 15, 1996 filed by Rodrigo Mateo (Mateo) against petitioner for unjust vexation, gross misconduct, insubordination, conduct unbecoming a public officer and alarm and scandal,
[58]
 allegedly committed through the following acts: a) his refusal to comply with several orders issued by respondent and Mateo for the filing of daily time records;
[59]
 and b) his having challenged Mateo to a fistfight.
[60]
 The Subpoena
[61]
 which Del Pilar issued to petitioner required the latter to answer the incidents cited by Mateo in his Sworn Complaint.  Even the evidence which Del Pilar summarized in his December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation pertains solely to said incidents.
[62]
Surprisingly, the conclusion which Del Pilar arrived at in his December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation, and which became the basis of the dismissal of petitioner, has no bearing whatsoever on the offenses with which the latter was charged under the Sworn Complaint nor to the incidents/acts described therein.  Rather, the conclusion pertains solely to the alleged defamatory statements which petitioner made in his April 1, 1996 Letter-Answer to the Sworn Complaint, thus:
That respondent having failed and refused to file his answer in the above-entitled case, this office has to resolve the case on the basis of the evidence on records [sic].
There is no doubt that the findings of the City Prosecutorâs Office, Cadiz City, of probable cause for libel on the basis of the communication of April 1, 1996 by [petitioner] cannot be disturbed x x x.  It appears that the defamation against complainant Mateo contained in said letter dated April 1, 1996 by [petitioner] is not considered privilege communication as found by the Cadiz City Prosecutor's Office.  
Such an act of [petitioner] in defaming complainant Mateo in a letter dated April 1, 1996 sent to this office furnishing copies of said letter to the City Mayor Eduardo G.  Varela, Atty.  Abelardo Gayatin, Jr., and Atty.  Jessie Caberoy of the Civil Service Commission instead of filing an answer to complaint filed against him no doubt constitute[s] Grave Misconduct which would warrant dismissal from the government service
.
[63]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
Nowhere in the records of Administrative Case No.  96-04 does it appear that petitioner was charged with grave misconduct, or that he was held to answer for his alleged defamatory statements in his April 1, 1996 letter.  Thus, the December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation of Del Pilar dismissing petitioner on that ground, and Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 of respondent approving said resolution/ recommendation were issued in utter contempt of the right of petitioner to due process.  Both are 
void ab initio
 and should be treated as inexistent
[64]
 -- it is as if no December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation was issued in Administrative Case No.  96-04, and therefore, Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 could not have approved and adopted a void resolution/recommendation.  In effect, there was nothing for petitioner to appeal from in Administrative Case No.  96-04.
Therefore, Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 and the December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation constituted an unlawful deprivation of petitioner's security of tenure, insofar as Administrative Case No.  96-04 is concerned.  The CA and CSC gravely erred in upholding them.
That said, however, the nullity of Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 and the December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation leaves Administrative Case No.  96-04 unresolved.  Although the Court may already decide said case based on the records before us, the better policy is for us to defer to the prerogative granted under Section 17,
[65]
 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, to the primary disciplining authority, the incumbent mayor of Cadiz City,
[66]
 whether or not to pursue said administrative case.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
GRANTED
.  The Court of Appeals Joint Decision dated October 15, 2002 and Resolution dated October 1, 2003 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
 only insofar as Benjamin B.  Geronga is concerned; Civil Service Commission Resolution No.  992107 dated September 17, 1999 and Resolution No.  000715 dated March 21, 2000 are 
ANNULLED
.  The December 1, 1997 Resolution/Recommendation of Cadiz City Legal Officer Marcelo R.  del Pilar and Memorandum Order No.  98-V-05 of Cadiz City Mayor Eduardo Varela in Administrative Case No.  96-04 are also 
ANNULLED
.  Administrative Case No.  96-04 is 
REMANDED
 to the incumbent city mayor of Cadiz City for proper disposition.
No costs.
