CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Petitioner Philippine Airlines as Owner, and Synergy Services Corporation (Synergy) as Contractor, entered into an Agreement 
[1]
 on July 15, 1991 whereby Synergy undertook to âprovide loading, unloading, delivery of baggage and cargo and other related services to and from [petitioner] âs aircraft at the Mactan Station.â
[2]
The Agreement specified the following âScope of Servicesâ of Contractor Synergy:
 
 
1.2 
 
CONTRACTOR shall furnish all the necessary capital, workers
, loading, unloading and delivery 
 materials, facilities, supplies, equipment and tools
 for the satisfactory performance and execution of the following services (the Work):
 
 
 
Loading and unloading of baggage and cargo to and from the aircraft;
Delivering of baggage from the ramp to the baggage claim area;
Picking up of baggage from the baggage sorting area to the designated parked aircraft;
Delivering of cargo unloaded from the flight to cargo terminal;
Other related jobs (but not janitorial functions) as may be required and necessary; 
CONTRACTOR shall perform and execute the aforementioned Work at the following areas located at Mactan Station, to wit:
 
Ramp Area
Baggage Claim Area
Cargo Terminal Area, and
Baggage Sorting Area
[3]
 (Underscoring supplied) 
 
 And it expressly provided that Synergy was âan independent contractor and . . . that there w[ould] be no employer-employee relationship between CONTRACTOR and/or its employees on the one hand, and OWNER, on the other.â
[4]
On the duration of the Agreement, Section 10 thereof provided:
 
 
10.1
 
 
Should at any time OWNER find the services herein undertaken by CONTRACTOR to be unsatisfactory, it shall notify CONTRACTOR who shall have fifteen (15) days from such notice within which to improve the services. If CONTRACTOR fails to improve the services under this Agreement according to OWNERâS specifications and standards, OWNER shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately and without advance notice.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.2 
 
 
Should CONTRACTOR 
fail to improve the services
 within the period stated above or should CONTRACTOR 
breach the terms
 of this Agreement and 
fail or refuse to perform the Work
 in such a manner as will be consistent with the achievement of the result therein contracted for or in any other way fail to comply strictly with any terms of this Agreement, 
OWNER at its option, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
 and to make other arrangements for having said Work performed and pursuant thereto shall retain so much of the money held on the Agreement as is necessary to cover the OWNERâs costs and damages, without prejudice to the right of OWNER to seek resort to the bond furnished by CONTRACTOR should the money in OWNERâs possession be insufficient.

 Except for respondent Benedicto Auxtero (Auxtero), the rest of the respondents, who appear to have been assigned by Synergy to petitioner following the execution of the July 15, 1991 Agreement, filed on March 3, 1992 complaints before the NLRC Regional Office VII at Cebu City against petitioner, Synergy and their respective officials for 
underpayment, non-payment of premium pay
 for holidays, 
premium pay
 for rest days, 
service incentive
 leave pay, 
13
th
 month pay and allowances
, and for 
regularization of employment status
 with petitioner, they claiming to be âperforming duties for the benefit of [petitioner] since their job is directly connected with [its] business x x x.â
[5]
Respondent Auxtero had initially filed a complaint against petitioner and Synergy and their respective officials for regularization of his employment status.  Later alleging that he was, without valid ground, verbally dismissed, he filed a complaint against petitioner and Synergy and their respective officials 
for illegal dismissal and reinstatement with full backwages
.
[6]
The complaints of respondents were consolidated.
By Decision
[7]
 of August 29, 1994, Labor Arbiter Dominador Almirante found Synergy an independent contractor and dismissed respondentsâ complaint for regularization against petitioner, but granted their money claims.  The 
fallo
 of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
 
 
(1)
 
Ordering respondents 
PAL
 and 
Synergy jointly
 and 
severally to pay
 all the complainants herein their 13
th
 month pay and service incentive leave benefits;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)
 
 Ordering 
respondent Synergy to pay complainant Benedicto Auxtero a financial assistance
 in the amount of P5,000.00.
 
 
The awards hereinabove enumerated in the aggregate total amount of THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE PESOS AND EIGHTY SEVEN CENTAVOS (P322,359.87) are computed in detail by our Fiscal Examiner which computation is hereto attached to form part of this decision.
The rest of the claims are hereby ordered dismissed
 for lack of merit.
[8]
  (Underscoring supplied)
On appeal by respondents, the NLRC, Fourth Division, Cebu City, vacated and set aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter by Decision
[9]
 of January 5, 1996, the 
fallo
 of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Labor Arbiter Dominador A. Almirante, dated August 29, 1994, is hereby VACATED and SET ASIDE and judgment is hereby rendered:
 
Declaring respondent Synergy Services Corporation to be  a âlabor-onlyâ contractor
;
Ordering respondent 
Philippine Airlines
 to accept, as its regular employees
, 
all the complainants
,  . . . and to 
give each of them the salaries, allowances and other employment benefits and privileges of a regular employee
 under the Collective Bargaining Agreement subsisting during the period of their employment;
x x x x
Declaring the dismissal of complainant 
Benedicto Auxtero to be illegal and ordering his reinstatement
 
as helper or utility man with respondent 
Philippine Airlines
, with full backwages, allowances and other benefits and privileges from the time of his dismissal up to his actual reinstatement; and
Dismissing the appeal of respondent Synergy Services Corporation, for lack of merit.
[10]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Only petitioner assailed the NLRC decision via petition for 
certiorari
 before this Court.
By Resolution
[11]
 of January 25, 1999, this Court referred the case to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition, conformably with 
St. Martin Funeral Homes v. National Labor Relations Commission
 which was promulgated on September 16, 1998.
The appellate court, by Decision of September 29, 2000, affirmed the Decision of the NLRC.
[12]
 Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration having been denied by Resolution of December 21, 2000,
[13]
 the present petition was filed, faulting the appellate court
I.
. . . IN UPHOLDING THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION DECISION WHICH 
IMPOSED THE RELATIONSHIP OF EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE
 BETWEEN PETITIONER AND THE RESPONDENTS HEREIN.
II.
. . . IN AFFIRMING THE RULING OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION 
ORDERING THE REINSTATEMENT OF RESPONDENT AUXTERO DESPITE THE ABSENCE [OF] ANY FACTUAL FINDING
 IN THE DECISION 
THAT PETITIONER ILLEGALLY TERMINATED HIS EMPLOYMENT
.
III.
. . . [IN ANY EVENT IN] COMMITT[ING] A PATENT AND GRAVE ERROR IN UPHOLDING THE DECISION OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION WHICH COMPELLED THE 
PETITIONER TO EMPLOY THE RESPONDENTS AS REGULAR EMPLOYEES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEIR SERVICES ARE IN EXCESS OF PETITIONER COMPANYâS OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
.
[14]
  (Underscoring supplied)
Petitioner argues that the law does not prohibit an employer from engaging an independent contractor, like Synergy, which has substantial capital in carrying on an independent business of contracting, to perform specific jobs.
Petitioner further argues that its contracting out to Synergy various services like janitorial, aircraft cleaning, baggage-handling, etc., which are directly related to its business, does not make respondents its employees.
Petitioner furthermore argues that none of the four (4) elements of an employer-employee relationship between petitioner and respondents, viz: selection and engagement of an employee, payment of wages, power of dismissal, and the power to control employeeâs conduct, is present in the case.
[15]
Finally, petitioner avers that reinstatement of respondents had been rendered impossible because it had reduced its personnel due to heavy losses as it had in fact terminated its service agreement with Synergy effective June 30, 1998
[16]
 as a cost-saving measure.
The decision of the case hinges on a determination of whether Synergy is a mere job-only contractor or a legitimate contractor.  If Synergy is found to be a mere job-only contractor, respondents could be considered as regular employees of petitioner as Synergy would then be a mere agent of petitioner in which case respondents would be entitled to all the benefits granted to petitionerâs regular employees; otherwise, if Synergy is found to be a legitimate contractor, respondentsâ claims against petitioner must fail as they would then be considered employees of Synergy.
The statutory basis of legitimate contracting or subcontracting is provided in Article 106 of the Labor Code which reads:
ART. 106. 
CONTRACTOR OR SUBCONTRACTOR
. â Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.
The Secretary of Labor may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under the Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.
There is "
labor-only
" contracting where the 
person supplying workers
 to an employer 
does not have substantial capital
 or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others,
 AND 
the workers recruited and placed by such person are 
performing activities which are directly related to the principal business
 of such employer
. In such cases, 
the person or intermediary shall be considered 
merely as an agent
 of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him
. (Emphasis, capitalization and underscoring supplied)
Legitimate contracting and labor-only contracting are defined in Department Order (D.O.) No. 18-02, Series of 2002 (Rules Implementing Articles 106 to 109 of the Labor Code, as amended) as follows:
Section 3. 
Trilateral relationship in contracting arrangements
. In 
legitimate contracting
, there exists a trilateral relationship under which there is a contract for a specific job, work or service between the principal and the contractor or subcontractor, and a contract of employment between the contractor or subcontractor and its workers. Hence, there are three parties involved in these arrangements, 
the principal
 which decides to farm out a job or service to a contractor or subcontractor, 
the contractor
 or subcontractor which has the capacity to independently undertake the performance of the job, work or service, and 
the contractual workers
 engaged by the contractor or subcontractor to accomplish the job, work or service.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Section 5.  
Prohibition against labor-only contracting
. 
Labor-only contracting
 is hereby declared prohibited. For this purpose, labor-only contracting shall refer to an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal, 
and 
any
 of the following elements are [
sic
] present
:
 
 
(i) 
 
The contractor or subcontractor 
does not have substantial capital or investment
 which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are 
directly related to the main business of the principal
; OR
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) 
 
The contractor 
does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work
 of the contractual employee. (Emphasis, underscoring and capitalization supplied)
âSubstantial capital or investmentâ and the âright to controlâ are defined in the same Section 5 of the Department Order as follows:
"
Substantial capital
 or investment" refers to capital stocks and subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, 
tools, equipment, implements, machineries and work premises
, actually and directly used by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of the job, work or service contracted out.
The "
right to control
" shall refer to the right reserved to the person 
for whom the services of the contractual workers are performed, to determine not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means to be used in reaching that end
.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
From the records of the case, it is gathered that the work performed by almost all of the respondents â loading and unloading of baggage and cargo of passengers â is directly related to the main business of petitioner.  And the equipment used by respondents as station loaders, such as trailers and conveyors, are owned by petitioner.
[17]
Petitioner asserts, however, that mere compliance with substantial capital requirement suffices for Synergy to be considered a legitimate contractor, citing 
Neri v. National Labor Relations Commission
.
[18]
 Petitionerâs reliance on said case is misplaced.
In 
Neri
, the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC both determined that Building Care Corporation had a capital stock of P1 million fully subscribed and paid for.
[19]
  The corporationâs status as independent contractor had in fact been previously confirmed in an earlier case
[20]
 by this Court which found it to be serving, among others, a university, an international bank, a big local bank, a hospital center, government agencies, etc.â
In stark contrast to the case at bar, while petitioner steadfastly asserted before the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC that Synergy has a substantial capital to engage in legitimate contracting, it failed to present evidence thereon.  As the NLRC held:
The decision of the Labor Arbiter merely mentioned on page 5 of his decision that respondent SYNERGY has substantial capital, but there is 
no showing in the records as to how much is that capital. Neither had respondents shown that SYNERGY has such substantial capital
. x x x
[21]
 (Underscoring supplied)
It was only after the appellate court rendered its challenged Decision of September 29, 2002 when petitioner, in its Motion for Reconsideration of the decision, sought to prove, for the first time, Synergyâs substantial capitalization by attaching photocopies of Synergyâs financial statements, 
e.g.
, balance sheets, statements of income and retained earnings, marked as âAnnexes âAâ â âA-4.ââ
[22]
More significantly, however, is that respondents worked alongside petitionerâs regular employees who were performing identical work.
[23]
  As 
San Miguel Corporation v. Aballa
[24]
 and 
Dole Philippines, Inc. v. Esteva, et al
.
[25]
 teach, such is an indicium of labor-only contracting.
For labor-only contracting to exist, Section 5 of D.O. No. 18-02 which requires 
any
 of two elements to be present is, for convenience, re- quoted:
 
 
(i) 
 
The contractor or subcontractor does not have 
substantial capital or investment
 which relates to the job, work or service to be performed 
and
 the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are 
directly related to the main business of the principal, OR
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii)
 
The contractor does not exercise the 
right to control
 over the performance of the work of the contractual employee. (Emphasis and CAPITALIZATION supplied)
Even if only one of the two elements is present then, there is labor-only contracting.
The control test element under the immediately-quoted paragraph (ii), which was not present in the old Implementing Rules (Department Order No. 10, Series of 1997),
[26]
 echoes the prevailing jurisprudential trend
[27]
 elevating such element as a primary determinant of employer-employee relationship in job contracting agreements.
One who claims to be an independent contractor has to prove that he contracted to do the work according to his own methods and without being subject to the employerâs control except only as to the results.
[28]
While petitioner claimed that it was Synergyâs supervisors who actually supervised respondents, it failed to present evidence thereon.  It did not even identify who were the Synergy supervisors assigned at the workplace.
Even the partiesâ Agreement does not lend support to petitionerâs claim, thus:
Section 6.  
Qualified and Experienced Worker: Ownerâs Right to Dismiss Workers
.
CONTRACTOR shall employ capable and experienced workers and foremen to carry out the loading, unloading and delivery Work as well as 
provide all equipment, loading, unloading and delivery equipment, materials
, supplies and tools necessary for the performance of the Work. CONTRACTOR shall upon OWNERâS request furnish the latter with information regarding the qualifications of the formerâs workers, to prove their capability and experience. 
Contractor shall require all its workers, employees, suppliers and visitors 
to comply with OWNERâS rules, regulations, procedures and directives relative to the safety and security of OWNERâS premises, properties and operations
. For this purpose, CONTRACTOR shall furnish its employees and workers 
identification cards to be countersigned by OWNER
 and 
uniforms to be approved by OWNER
. OWNER may 
require CONTRACTOR to dismiss immediately and prohibit entry into OWNERâS premises
 of any person employed therein by CONTRACTOR who in OWNERâS opinion is incompetent or misconducts himself or 
does not comply with OWNERâS reasonable instructions
 and requests regarding security, safety and other matters and such person shall not again be employed to perform the services hereunder without OWNERâS permission.
[29]
 (Underscoring partly in the original and partly supplied; emphasis supplied)
Petitioner in fact admitted that it fixes the work schedule of respondents as their work was dependent on the frequency of plane arrivals.
[30]
 And as the NLRC found, petitionerâs managers and supervisors approved respondentsâ weekly work assignments and respondents and other regular PAL employees were all referred to as âstation attendantsâ of the cargo operation and airfreight services of petitioner.
[31]
Respondents having performed tasks which are usually necessary and desirable in the air transportation business of petitioner, they should be deemed its regular employees and Synergy as a labor-only contractor.
[32]
The express provision in the Agreement that Synergy was an independent contractor and there would be âno employer-employee relationship between [Synergy] and/or its employees on one hand, and [petitioner] on the other handâ is not legally binding and conclusive as contractual provisions are not valid determinants of the existence of such relationship.  For it is the 
totality of the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case
[33]
 which is determinative of the partiesâ relationship.
Respecting the dismissal on November 15, 1992
[34]
 of Auxtero, a regular employee of petitioner who had been working as utility man/helper since November 1988, it is not legally justified for want of just or authorized cause therefor and for non-compliance with procedural due process. Petitionerâs claim that he abandoned his work does not persuade.
[35]
  The elements of abandonment being (1) the failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship manifested by some overt acts,
[36]
 the 
onus probandi
 lies with petitioner which, however, failed to discharge the same.
Auxtero, having been declared to be a regular employee of petitioner, and found to be illegally dismissed from employment, should be entitled to salary differential
[37]
 from the time he rendered one year of service until his dismissal, reinstatement plus backwages until the finality of this decision.
[38]
  In view, however, of the long period of time
[39]
 that had elapsed since his dismissal on November 15, 1992, it would be appropriate to award separation pay of one (1) month salary for each year of service, in lieu of reinstatement.
[40]
As regards the remaining respondents, the Court affirms the ruling of both the NLRC and the appellate court, ordering petitioner to accept them as its regular employees and to give each of them the salaries, allowances and other employment benefits and privileges of a regular employee under the pertinent Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Petitioner claims, however, that it has become impossible for it to comply with the orders of the NLRC and the Court of Appeals, for during the pendency of this case, it was forced to reduce its personnel due to heavy losses caused by economic crisis and the pilotsâ strike of June 5, 1998.
[41]
 Hence, there are no available positions where respondents could be placed.
And petitioner informs that âthe employment contracts of all if not most of the respondents . . .  were terminated by Synergy effective 
30 June 1998
 when petitioner terminated its contract with Synergy.â
[42]
Other than its bare allegations, petitioner presented nothing to substantiate its impossibility of compliance.  In fact, petitioner waived this defense by failing to raise it in its Memorandum filed on June 14, 1999 before the Court of Appeals.
[43]
  Further, the notice of termination in 1998 was in disregard of a subsisting temporary restraining order
[44]
 to preserve the status quo, issued by this Court in 1996 before it referred the case to the Court of Appeals in January 1999.  So as to thwart the attempt to subvert the implementation of the assailed decision, respondents are deemed to be continuously employed by petitioner, for purposes of computing the wages and benefits due respondents.
Finally, it must be stressed that respondents, having been declared to be regular employees of petitioner, Synergy being a mere agent of the latter, had acquired security of tenure.  As such, they could only be dismissed by petitioner, the real employer, on the basis of just or authorized cause, and with observance of procedural due process.
WHEREFORE,
 the Court of Appeals Decision of September 29, 2000 is 
AFFIRMED
 with MODIFICATION.
Petitioner PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC. is ordered to:
 
 
(a) 
 
accept respondents ENRIQUE LIGAN, EMELITO SOCO, ALLAN PANQUE, JOLITO OLIVEROS, RICHARD GONCER, NONILON PILAPIL, AQUILINO YBANEZ, BERNABE SANDOVAL, RUEL GONCER, VIRGILIO P. CAMPOS, JR., ARTHUR M. CAPIN, RAMEL BERNARDES, LORENZO BUTANAS, BENSON CARESUSA, JEFFREY LLENOS, ROQUE PILAPIL, ANTONIO M. PAREJA, CLEMENTE R. LUMAYNO, NELSON TAMPUS, ROLANDO TUNACAO, CHERRIE ALEGRES, EDUARDO MAGDADARAUG, NELSON M. DULCE and ALLAN BENTUZAL 
as its regular employees in their same or substantially equivalent positions
, and pay the 
wages and benefits due
 them as regular employees plus 
salary differential
 corresponding to the difference between the wages and benefits given them and those granted to petitionerâs other regular employees of the same rank; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
 
 pay respondent BENEDICTO AUXTERO 
salary differential; backwages
 from the time of his dismissal until the finality of this decision; and 
separation pay
, in lieu of reinstatement, equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service until the finality of this decision.
 
 
 
 
 There being no data from which this Court may determine the monetary liabilities of petitioner, the case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter solely for that purpose.
