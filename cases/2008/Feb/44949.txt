REYES, R.T., J.:


THE vehicular collision resulting in damages and
injuries in this case could have been avoided if the stalled prime
mover with trailer were parked properly and equipped with an early
warning device. It is high time We sounded the call for strict
enforcement of the law and regulation on traffic and vehicle
registration.

Before Us is a petition for review on 
certiorari
 of the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) modifying that
[2]

of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Butuan City finding private
respondents Liberty Forest, Inc. and Cresilito Limbaga liable to
petitioner Dy Teban Trading, Inc. for damages.



Facts

On July 4, 1995, at around 4:45 a.m., Rogelio Ortiz, with helper Romeo
Catamora, was driving a Nissan van owned by petitioner Dy Teban
Trading, Inc. along the National Highway in 
Barangay
 Sumilihon, Butuan City, going to Surigao City. They were delivering commercial ice to nearby 
barangays

and municipalities. A Joana Paula passenger bus was cruising on the
opposite lane towards the van. In between the two vehicles was a parked
prime mover with a trailer, owned by private respondent Liberty Forest,
Inc.
[3]

The night before, at around 10:00 p.m., the prime mover with trailer
suffered a tire blowout. The driver, private respondent Cresilito
Limbaga, parked the prime mover askew occupying a substantial portion
of the national highway, on the lane of the passenger bus. He parked
the prime mover with trailer at the shoulder of the road with the left
wheels still on the cemented highway and the right wheels on the sand
and gravel shoulder of the highway.
[4]

The prime mover was not equipped with triangular, collapsible
reflectorized plates, the early warning device required under Letter of
Instruction No. 229. As substitute, Limbaga placed a banana trunk with
leaves on the front and the rear portion of the prime mover to warn
incoming motorists. It is alleged that Limbaga likewise placed kerosene
lighted tin cans on the front and rear of the trailer.
[5]

To avoid hitting the parked prime mover occupying its lane, the
incoming passenger bus swerved to the right, onto the lane of the
approaching Nissan van. Ortiz saw two bright and glaring headlights and
the approaching passenger bus. He pumped his break slowly, swerved to
the left to avoid the oncoming bus but the van hit the front of the
stationary prime mover. The passenger bus hit the rear of the prime
mover.
[6]

Ortiz and Catamora only suffered minor injuries. The Nissan van,
however, became inoperable as a result of the incident. After the
collision, SPO4 Teofilo Pame conducted an investigation and submitted a
police traffic incident investigation report.
[7]


On October 31, 1995, petitioner Nissan van owner filed a complaint for damages
[8]

against private respondents prime mover owner and driver with the RTC
in Butuan City. The Joana Paula passenger bus was not impleaded as
defendant in the complaint.



RTC Disposition





On August 7, 2001, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of petitioner Dy Teban Trading, Inc. with a 
fallo
 reading:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered directing, ordaining and ordering:

a) That defendants Liberty Forest, Inc. and Cresilito M. Limbaga pay,
jointly and solidarily, plaintiff Dy Teban Trading, Inc. the amounts of
P279,832.00 as actual and compensatory damages, P30,000.00 as
attorneyâs fees and P5,000.00 as expenses of litigation;


b) That all money claims of plaintiff Rogelio C. Ortiz are dismissed;


c) That defendant Jose Ching is absolved from any civil liability or the case against him dismissed;


d) That the counterclaim of all the defendants is dismissed; and


e) That defendants Liberty Forest, Inc. and Cresilito M. Limbaga to pay, jointly and solidarily, the costs.


SO ORDERED.
[9]

The RTC held that the proximate cause of the three-way vehicular
collision was improper parking of the prime mover on the national
highway and the absence of an early warning device on the vehicle,
thus:

The court finds that the proximate cause of the incidents is the negligence and carelessness attributable to the defendants.

When the trailer being pulled by the prime mover suffered two (2) flat
tires at Sumilihon, the prime mover and trailer were parked
haphazardly, as the right tires of the prime mover were the only ones
on the sand and gravel shoulder of the highway while the left tires and
all the tires of the trailer were on the cemented pavement of the
highway, occupying almost the whole of the right lane on the direction
the prime mover and trailer were traveling. The statement of Limbaga
that he could not park the prime mover and trailer deeper into the sand
and gravel shoulder of the highway to his right because there were
banana plants is contradicted by the picture marked Exhibit âF.â 
The
picture shows that there was ample space on the shoulder. If defendant
Limbaga was careful and prudent enough, he should have the prime mover
and trailer traveled more distance forward so that the bodies of the
prime mover and trailer would be far more on the shoulder rather than
on the cemented highway when they were parked.
 x x x The court has
some doubts on the statement of witness-driver Limbaga that there were
banana trunks with leaves and lighted tin cans with crude oil placed 3
strides in front of the prime mover and behind the trailer because the
testimonies of witnesses Rogelio C. Ortiz, driver of the ice van, Romeo
D. Catamora, helper of the ice van, and Police Traffic Investigator
SPO3 Teofilo M. Pame show that there were no banana trunks with leaves
and lighted tin cans at the scene of the incident. But even assuming
that there were banana trunks with leaves but they were placed close to
the prime mover and trailer as they were placed 3 strides away which to
the mind of the court is equivalent approximately to 3 meters and with
this distance, approaching vehicles would have no sufficient time and
space to make a complete stop, especially if the vehicles are heavy and
loaded. If there were lighted tin cans, it was not explained by the
defendants why the driver, especially driver witness Ortiz, did not see
them.



x x x x

Defendant Liberty Forest, Inc. did not exercise the diligence of a good
father of a family in managing and running its business. The evidence
on record shows that 
it
failed to provide its prime mover and trailer with the required âearly
warning devicesâ with reflectors and it did not keep proper maintenance
and condition of the prime mover and the trailer.
 The circumstances
show that the trailer were provided with wornout tires and with only
one (1) piece of spare tire. The pictures marked Exhibit â3â and â4â
show that two (2) flat tires suffered by the trailer and these two (2)
tires were attached to one of the two (2) I-beams or axles attached to
the rear of the trailer which axle is very near but behind the other
axle and with the location of the 2 I-beams, it would have the other
I-beam that would have suffered the flat tires as it has to bear the
brunt of weight of the D-8 bulldozer. The bulldozer was not loaded
directly above the two (2) I-beams as 2 I-beams, as a pair, were
attached at the far rear end of the trailer.



x x x x

However, defendant Jose Ching should be absolved of any liability as
there is no showing that he is the manager or CEO of defendant Liberty
Forest, Inc. Although in the answer, it is admitted that he is an
officer of the defendant corporation, but it is not clarified what kind
of position he is holding, as he could be an officer as one of the
members of the Board of Directors or a cashier and treasurer of the
corporation. Witness Limbaga in his testimony mentioned a certain Boy
Ching as the Manager but it was never clarified whether or not Boy
Ching and defendant Jose Ching is one and the same person.
[10]


Private respondents appealed to the CA.



CA Disposition


On August 28, 2003, the CA reversed the RTC decision, disposing as follows:


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the decision dated
August 7, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 2, Butuan City in
Civil Case No. 4360 is hereby 
PARTLY MODIFIED
 by absolving the
defendants-appellants/appellees of any liability to
plaintiffs-appellants/appellees by reason of the incident on July 4,
1995.

The dismissal of the case against Jose Ching, the counterclaim of
defendants-appellants/appellees and the money claim of Rogelio Ortiz 
STANDS.


SO ORDERED.
[11]

In partly reversing or partly modifying the RTC decision, the CA held
that the proximate cause of the vehicular collision was the failure of
the Nissan van to give way or yield to the right of way of the
passenger bus, thus:

It was stated that the Joana Paula bus in trying to avoid
a head-on collision with the truck, sideswept the parked trailer loaded
with bulldozer.


Evidently, the driver of the Joana Paula bus was aware of the presence on its lane of the parked trailer with bulldozer.

For this reason, it proceeded to occupy what was left of its lane and
part of the opposite lane. The truck occupying the opposite lane failed
to give way or yield the right of way to the oncoming bus by proceeding
with the same speed. 
The two vehicles were, in effect, trying to
beat each other in occupying a single lane. The bus was the first to
occupy the said lane but upon realizing that the truck refused to give
way or yield the right of way, the bus, as a precaution, geared to its
right where the trailer was parked. Unfortunately, the bus
miscalculated its distance from the parked trailer and its rear right
side hit the protruding blade of the bulldozer then on the top of the
parked trailer.
 The impact of the collision on its right rear side
with the blade of the bulldozer threw the bus further to the opposite
lane, landing its rear portion on the shoulder of the opposite lane.



x x x x


Facts of the case reveal that when Ortiz, the driver of the truck,
failed to give the Joana Paula bus the space on the road it needed, the
latter vehicle scraped its rear right side on the protruded bulldozer
blade and the impact threw the bus directly on the path of the oncoming
truck.
 This made plaintiffs-appellants/appellees conclude that the
Joana Paula bus occupied its lane which forced Ortiz, the driver of the
truck, to swerve to its left and ram the front of the parked trailer.



x x x x


The trailer was parked because its two (2) rear-left tires were blown out. 
With
a bulldozer on top of the trailer and two (2) busted tires, it would be
dangerous and quite impossible for the trailer to further park on the
graveled shoulder of the road. To do so will cause the flat car to tilt
and may cause the bulldozer to fall from where it was mounted.
 In
fact, it appeared that the driver of the trailer tried its best to park
on the graveled shoulder since the right-front tires were on the
graveled shoulder of the road.

The lower court erred in stating that the Joana Paula bus swerved to
the left of the truck because it did not see the parked trailer due to
lack of warning sign of danger of any kind that can be seen from a
distance. The damage suffered by the Joana Paula bus belied this
assessment. 
As
stated before, the Joana Paula bus, with the intention of passing first
which it did, first approached the space beside the parked trailer,
veered too close to the parked trailer thereby hitting its rear right
side on the protruding bulldozer blade.
 Since the damage was on the
rear right most of the bus, it was clearly on the space which was wide
enough for a single passing vehicle but not sufficient for two (2)
passing vehicles. The bus was thrown right to the path of the truck by
the impact of the collision of its rear right side with the bulldozer
blade.
[12]

The CA disagreed with the RTC that the prime mover did not have an
early warning device. The appellate court accepted the claim of private
respondent that Limbaga placed kerosene lighted tin cans on the front
and rear of the trailer which, in 
Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,
[13]
 may act as substitute early warning device. The CA stated:


Likewise, it was incorrect for the lower court to state
that there was no warning sign of danger of any kind, most probably
referring to the absence of the triangular reflectorized plates. The
police sketch clearly indicated the stack of banana leaves placed at
the rear of the parked trailer. 
The trailerâs driver testified that they placed kerosene lighted tin can at the back of the parked trailer.


A pair of triangular reflectorized plates is not the only early warning device allowed by law. The Supreme Court (in 
Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
) held that:


âx x x Col. Dela Cruz and Romano testified that they did
not see any early warning device at the scene of the accident. They
were referring to the triangular reflectorized plates in red and yellow
issued by the Land Transportation Office. 
However, the evidence
shows that Recontique and Ecala placed a kerosene lamp or torch at the
edge of the road, near the rear portion of the truck to serve as an
early warning device. This substantially complies with Section 34(g) of
the Land Transportation and Traffic Code
 x x x


Baliwagâs argument that the kerosene lamp or torch does not substantially comply with the law is untenable. 
The
aforequoted law clearly allows the use not only of an early warning
device of the triangular reflectorized platesâ variety but also parking
lights or flares visible one hundred meters away.
 x x x.â

This Court holds that the defendants-appellants/appellees were not
negligent in parking the trailer on the scene of the accident. It would
have been different if there was only one flat tire and
defendant-appellant/appellee Limbaga failed to change the same and left
immediately.

As such, defendants-appellants/appellees are not liable for the damages
suffered by plaintiffs-appellants/appellees. Whatever damage
plaintiffs-appellants/appellees suffered, they alone must bear them.
[14]



Issues


Petitioner raises two issues
[15]
 for Our consideration, to wit:



I.


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, 
WITHOUT ANY
AVAILABLE CONCRETE EVIDENCE, ERRONEOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE
EARLY WARNING DEVICES PLACED IN FRONT OF THE
DEFENDANT-APPELLANTS/APPELLEESâ TRUCK AND FLAT CAR
 TO WARN PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT/APPELLEE ROGELIO ORTIZ OF THEIR PRESENCE.



II.


WITH DUE RESPECT, IT IS HIGH TIME TO 
ENFORCE THE LAW ON EARLY WARNING DEVICES
 IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.



Our Ruling





The petition is meritorious.

The meat of the petition is whether or not the prime mover is liable
for the damages suffered by the Nissan van. The RTC ruled in the
affirmative holding that the proximate cause of the vehicular collision
was the negligence of Limbaga in parking the prime mover on the
national highway without an early warning device on the vehicle. The CA
reversed the RTC decision, holding that the proximate cause of the
collision was the negligence of Ortiz in not yielding to the right of
way of the passenger bus.

Article 2176 of the Civil Code provides that whoever by act or omission
causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged
to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no
pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a 
quasi-delict
. To sustain a claim based on 
quasi-delict
,
the following requisites must concur: (a) damage suffered by plaintiff;
(b) fault or negligence of defendant; and (c) connection of cause and
effect between the fault or negligence of defendant and the damage
incurred by plaintiff.
[16]

There is no dispute that the Nissan van suffered damage. That is borne
by the records and conceded by the parties. The outstanding issues are
negligence and proximate cause. Tersely put, the twin issues are: (a)
whether or not prime mover driver Limbaga was negligent in parking the
vehicle; and (b) whether or not his negligence was the proximate cause
of the damage to the Nissan van.


Limbaga was negligent in parking 
the prime mover on the national 
highway; he failed 
to prevent or 
minimize the risk to oncoming 
motorists.

Negligence is defined as the failure to observe for the protection of
the interests of another person that degree of care, precaution, and
vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, whereby such other
person suffers injury.
[17]
 The Supreme Court stated the test of negligence in the landmark case 
Picart v. Smith
[18]
 as follows:


The test by which to determine the existence or negligence in a particular case may be stated as follows: 
Did
the defendant in doing the alleged negligent act use that reasonable
care and caution which an ordinary person would have used in the same
situation? If not, then he is guilty of negligence.
 The law here in
effect adopts the standard supposed to be supplied by the imaginary
conduct of the discreet paterfamilias of the Roman law. The existence
of negligence in a given case is not determined by reference to the
personal judgment of the actor in the situation before him. The law
considers what would be reckless, blameworthy, or negligent in the man
of ordinary intelligence and prudence and determines liability by that.
(Underscoring supplied)

The test of negligence is objective. We measure the act or omission of
the tortfeasor with that of an ordinary reasonable person in the same
situation. The test, as applied to this case, is whether Limbaga, in
parking the prime mover, used that reasonable care and caution which an
ordinary reasonable person would have used in the same situation.

We find that Limbaga was utterly negligent in parking the prime mover
askew on the right side of the national highway. The vehicle occupied a
substantial portion of the national road on the lane of the passenger
bus. It was parked at the shoulder of the road with its left wheels
still on the cemented highway and the right wheels on the sand and
gravel shoulder of the highway. It is common sense that the skewed
parking of the prime mover on the national road posed a serious risk to
oncoming motorists. It was incumbent upon Limbaga to take some measures
to prevent that risk, or at least minimize it.

We are unable to agree with the CA conclusion âit would have been
dangerous and quite impossible to further park the prime mover on the
graveled shoulder of the road because the prime mover may tilt and the
bulldozer may fall off.â The photographs taken after the incident show
that it could have been possible for Limbaga to park the prime mover
completely on the shoulder of the national road without risk to
oncoming motorists. We agree with the RTC observation on this point,
thus:

x x x The statement of Limbaga that he could not park the
prime mover and trailer deeper into the sand and gravel shoulder of the
highway to his right because there were banana plants is contradicted
by the picture marked Exhibit âF.â 
The picture shows that there was
ample space on the shoulder. If defendant Limbaga was careful and
prudent enough, he should have the prime mover and trailer traveled
more distance forward so that the bodies of the prime mover and trailer
would be far more on the shoulder rather than on the cemented highway
when they were parked.
 Although at the time of the incident, it was
about 4:45 in the morning and it was drizzling but there is showing
that it was pitch dark that whoever travels along the highway must be
extra careful. If the Joana Paula bus swerved to the lane on which the
âNissanâ ice van was properly traveling, as prescribed by Traffic Rules
and Regulations, it is because the driver of the bus did not see at a
distance the parked prime mover and trailer on the busâ proper lane
because there was no warning signs of danger of any kind that can be
seen from a distance.
[19]

Limbaga also failed to take proper steps to minimize the risk posed by
the improperly parked prime mover. He did not immediately inform his
employer, private respondent Liberty Forest, Inc., that the prime mover
suffered two tire blowouts and that he could not have them fixed
because he had only one spare tire. Instead of calling for help,
Limbaga took it upon himself to simply place banana leaves on the front
and rear of the prime mover to serve as warning to oncoming motorists.
Worse, Limbaga slept on the prime mover instead of standing guard
beside the vehicle. By his own account, Limbaga was sleeping on the
prime mover at the time of the collision and that he was only awakened
by the impact of the Nissan van and the passenger bus on the prime
mover.
[20]

Limbaga also admitted on cross-examination that it was his first time
to drive the prime mover with trailer loaded with a D-8 caterpillar
bulldozer.
[21]

We find that private respondent Liberty Forest, Inc. was utterly
negligent in allowing a novice driver, like Limbaga, to operate a
vehicle, such as a truck loaded with a bulldozer, which required highly
specialized driving skills. Respondent employer clearly failed to
properly supervise Limbaga in driving the prime mover.

The RTC noted that private respondent Liberty Forest, Inc. also failed
to keep the prime mover in proper condition at the time of the
collision. The prime mover had worn out tires. It was only equipped
with one spare tire. It was for this reason that Limbaga was unable to
change the two blown out tires because he had only one spare. The
bulldozer was not even loaded properly on the prime mover, which caused
the tire blowouts.

All told, We agree with the RTC that private respondent Limbaga was
negligent in parking the prime mover on the national highway. Private
respondent Liberty Forest, Inc. was also negligent in failing to
supervise Limbaga and in ensuring that the prime mover was in proper
condition.


The case of Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. 
Court of Appeals is inapplicable; 
Limbaga did not 
put lighted kerosene 
tin cans on the front and rear of the 
prime mover.

Anent the absence of an early warning device on the prime mover, the CA
erred in accepting the bare testimony of Limbaga that he placed
kerosene lighted tin cans on the front and rear of the prime mover. The
evidence on records belies such claim. The CA reliance on 
Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
[22]
 as authority for the proposition that kerosene lighted tin cans may act as substitute early warning device is misplaced.


First,
 the traffic incident report did not mention any lighted
tin cans on the prime mover or within the immediate vicinity of the
accident. Only banana leaves were placed on the prime mover. The report
reads:

VIII â RESULT OF INVESTIGATION: A Joana Paula Bus, with
Body No. 7788, with Plate No. LVA-137, driven by one Temestocles Relova
v. Antero, of legal age, married and a resident of San Roque,
Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte, while traveling along the National
Highway, coming from the east going to the west direction, as it moves
along the way and upon reaching Brgy. Sumilihon, Butuan City to evade
bumping to the approaching Nissan Ice Van with Plate No. PNT-247,
driven by one Rogelio Cortez y Ceneza. 
As the result, the Joana Paula Bus accidentally busideswept (sic) to the parked Prime Mover with Trailer loaded with Bulldozer 
without early warning device,
 instead placing only dry banana leaves three (3) meters at the rear portion of the Trailer,

while failure to place at the front portion, and the said vehicle
occupied the whole lane. As the result, the Joana Paula Bus hit to the
left edge blade of the Bulldozer. Thus, causing the said bus swept to
the narrow shouldering, removing the rear four (4) wheels including the
differential and injuring the above-stated twelve (12) passengers and
damaged to the right side fender above the rear wheel. Thus, causing
damage on it. While the Nissan Ice Van in evading, accidentally swerved
to the left lane and accidentally bumped to the front bumper of the
parked Prime Mover with Trailer loaded with Bulldozer. Thus, causing
heavy damage to said Nissan Ice Van including the cargoes of the said
van.
[23]


Second,
 SPO4 Pame, who investigated the collision, testified
[24]

that only banana leaves were placed on the front and rear of the prime
mover. He did not see any lighted tin cans in the immediate vicinity of
the collision.


Third,
 the claim of Limbaga that he placed lighted tin cans on
the front and rear of the prime mover belatedly surfaced only during
his direct examination. No allegation to this effect was made by
private respondents in their Answer to the complaint for damages.
Petitionerâs counsel promptly objected to the testimony of Limbaga,
thus:

ATTY. ROSALES:
Q. Now you mentioned about placing some
word signs in front and at the rear of the prime mover with trailer,
will you please describe to us what this word signs are?


A. We placed 
a piece of cloth on tin cans

and filled them with crude oil. And these tin cans were lighted and
they are like torches. These two lights or torches were placed in front
and at the rear side of the prime mover with trailer. After each torch,
we placed 
banana trunk.
 The banana trunk is placed between the
two (2) torches and the prime mover, both on the rear and on the front
portion of the prime mover.


Q. How far was the lighted tin cans with wick placed in front of the prime mover.


ATTY. ASIS:


At this point, 
we
will be objecting to questions particularly referring to the alleged
tin cans as some of the warning-sign devices, considering that there is
no allegation to that effect in the answer of the defendants.
 The
answer was just limited to the numbers 4 & 5 of the answer. And,
therefore, if we follow the rule of the binding effect of an allegation
in the complaint, then the party will not be allowed to introduce
evidence to attack jointly or rather the same, paragraph 5 states,
warning device consisting of 3 banana trunks, banana items and leaves
were filed. He can be cross-examined in the point, Your Honor.


COURT:


Q. 
Put that on record that as far as this tin cans are concerned, the plaintiffs are interposing continuing objections.
 But the Court will allow the question.
[25]

We thus agree with the RTC that Limbaga did not place lighted tin cans
on the front and rear of the prime mover. We give more credence to the
traffic incident report and the testimony of SPO4 Pame that only banana
leaves were placed on the vehicle. 
Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
[26]
 thus finds no application to the case at bar.


The skewed parking of the prime 
mover was the proximate cause of 
the collision.

Proximate cause is defined as that cause, which, in natural and
continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause,
produces the injury, and without which the result would not have
occurred. More comprehensively, proximate cause is that cause 
acting
first and producing the injury, either immediately or by setting other
events in motion, all constituting a natural and continuous chain of
events, each having a close causal connection with its immediate
predecessor,
 the final event in the chain immediately effecting the
injury as natural and probable result of the cause which first acted,
under such circumstances that the person responsible for the first
event should, as an ordinarily prudent and intelligent person, have
reasonable ground to expect at the moment of his act or default that an
injury to some person might probably result therefrom.
[27]

There is no exact mathematical formula to determine proximate cause. It
is based upon mixed considerations of logic, common sense, policy and
precedent.
[28]

Plaintiff must, however, establish a sufficient link between the act or
omission and the damage or injury. That link must not be remote or
far-fetched; otherwise, no liability will attach. The damage or injury
must be a natural and probable result of the act or omission. In the
precedent-setting 
Vda. de Bataclan v. Medina,
[29]
 this Court discussed the necessary link that must be established between the act or omission and the damage or injury, 
viz.:


It may be that ordinarily, when a passenger bus overturns,
and pins down a passenger, merely causing him physical injuries, if
through some event, unexpected and extraordinary, the overturned bus is
set on fire, say, by lightning, or if some highwaymen after looting the
vehicle sets it on fire, and the passenger is burned to death, one
might still contend that the proximate cause of his death was the fire
and not the overturning of the vehicle. But in the present case and
under the circumstances obtaining in the same, we do not hesitate to
hold that the proximate cause of the death of Bataclan was the
overturning of the bus, this for the reason that when the vehicle
turned not only on its side but completely on its back, 
the leaking
of the gasoline from the tank was not unnatural or unexpected; that the
coming of the men with a lighted torch was in response to the call for
help, made not only by the passengers, but most probably, by the driver
and the conductor themselves,
 and that because it was very dark
(about 2:30 in the morning), the rescuers had to carry a light with
them; and coming as they did from a rural area where lanterns and
flashlights were not available, they had to use a torch, the most handy
and available; and what was more natural than that said rescuers should
innocently approach the overturned vehicle to extend the aid and effect
the rescue requested from them. 
In other words, the coming of the
men with the torch was to be expected and was natural sequence of the
overturning of the bus, the trapping of some of its passengersâ bus,
the trapping of some of its passengers and the call for outside help.


The ruling in 
Bataclan

has been repeatedly cited in subsequent cases as authority for the
proposition that the damage or injury must be a natural or probable
result of the act or omission. Here, We agree with the RTC that the
damage caused to the Nissan van was a natural and probable result of
the improper parking of the prime mover with trailer. As discussed, the
skewed parking of the prime mover posed a serious risk to oncoming
motorists. Limbaga failed to prevent or minimize that risk. The skewed
parking of the prime mover triggered the series of events that led to
the collision, particularly the swerving of the passenger bus and the
Nissan van.

Private respondents Liberty Forest, Inc. and Limbaga are liable for all
damages that resulted from the skewed parking of the prime mover. Their
liability includes those damages resulting from precautionary measures
taken by other motorist in trying to avoid collision with the parked
prime mover. As We see it, the passenger bus swerved to the right, onto
the lane of the Nissan van, to avoid colliding with the improperly
parked prime mover. The driver of the Nissan van, Ortiz, reacted
swiftly by swerving to the left, onto the lane of the passenger bus,
hitting the parked prime mover. Ortiz obviously would not have swerved
if not for the passenger bus abruptly occupying his vanâs lane. The
passenger bus, in turn, would not have swerved to the lane of the
Nissan van if not for the prime mover improperly parked on its lane.
The skewed parking is the proximate cause of the damage to the Nissan
van.


In 
Phoenix Construction, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court,
[30]
 this Court held that a similar vehicular collision was caused by the skewed parking of a dump truck on the national road, thus:


The conclusion we draw from the factual circumstances
outlined above is that private respondent Dionisio was negligent the
night of the accident. He was hurrying home that night and driving
faster than he should have been. Worse, he extinguished his headlights
at or near the intersection of General Lacuna and General Santos
Streets and thus did not see the dump truck that was parked askew and
sticking out onto the road lane.


Nonetheless, 
we agree
with the Court of First Instance and the Intermediate Appellate Court
that the legal and proximate cause of the accident and of Dionisioâs
injuries was the wrongful or negligent manner in which the dump truck
was parked â
 in other words, the negligence of petitioner Carbonel.
That there was a reasonable relationship between petitioner Carbonelâs
negligence on the one hand and the accident and respondentâs injuries
on the other hand, is quite clear. 
Put in a slightly different
manner, the collision of Dionisioâs car with the dump truck was a
natural and foreseeable consequence of the truck driverâs negligence.


x x x x

We believe, secondly, that the truck driverâs negligence far from being
a âpassive and static conditionâ was rather an indispensable and
efficient cause. 
The
collision between the dump truck and the private respondentâs car would
in all probability not have occurred had the dump truck not been parked
askew without any warning lights or reflector devices. The improper
parking of the dump truck created an unreasonable risk of injury for
anyone driving down General Lacuna Street and for having so created
this risk, the truck driver must be held responsible.
 In our view,
Dionisioâs negligence, although later in point of time than the truck
driverâs negligence and, therefore, closer to the accident, was not an
efficient intervening or independent cause. What the Petitioner
describes as an âintervening causeâ was no more than a foreseeable
consequence of the risk created by the negligent manner in which the
truck driver had parked the dump truck. In other words, the petitioner
truck driver owed a duty to private respondent Dionisio and others
similarly situated not to impose upon them the very risk the truck
driver had created. Dionisioâs negligence was not of an independent and
overpowering nature as to cut, as it were, the chain of causation in
fact between the improper parking of the dump truck and the accident,
nor to sever the 
juris vinculum
 of liability. x x x (Underscoring supplied)


We cannot rule on the proportionate 
or contributory liability of the 
passenger bus, if any, because it was 
not a party to the case; joint 
tortfeasors are solidarily liable.

The CA also faults the passenger bus for the vehicular collision. The
appellate court noted that the passenger bus was âawareâ of the
presence of the prime mover on its lane, but it still proceeded to
occupy the lane of the Nissan van. The passenger bus also miscalculated
its distance from the prime mover when it hit the vehicle.

We cannot definitively rule on the proportionate or contributory
liability of the Joana Paula passenger bus vis-Ã -vis the prime mover
because it was not a party to the complaint for damages. Due process
dictates that the passenger bus must be given an opportunity to present
its own version of events before it can be held liable. Any
contributory or proportionate liability of the passenger bus must be
litigated in a separate action, barring any defense of prescription or
laches. Insofar as petitioner is concerned, the proximate cause of the
collision was the improper parking of the prime mover. It was the
improper parking of the prime mover which set in motion the series of
events that led to the vehicular collision.

Even granting that the passenger bus was at fault, itâs fault will not
necessarily absolve private respondents from liability. If at fault,
the passenger bus will be a joint tortfeasor along with private
respondents. The liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and solidary.
This means that petitioner may hold either of them liable for damages
from the collision. In 
Philippine National Construction Corporation v. Court of Appeals,
[31]
 this Court held:


According to the great weight of authority, where 
the
concurrent or successive negligent acts or omission of two or more
persons, although acting independently of each other, are, in
combination, the direct and proximate cause of a single injury to a
third person and it is impossible to determine in what proportion each
contributed to the injury, either is responsible for the whole injury,

even though his act alone might not have caused the entire injury, or
the same damage might have resulted from the acts of the other
tort-feasor x x x.


In 
Far Eastern Shipping Company v. Court of Appeals,
 the Court declared that the liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and solidary, to wit:


It may be said, as a general rule, that negligence in order
to render a person liable need not be the sole cause of an injury. It
is sufficient that his negligence, concurring with one or more
efficient causes other than plaintiffâs, is the proximate cause of the
injury. Accordingly, where several causes combine to produce injuries,
a person is not relieved from liability because he is responsible for
only one of them, it being sufficient that the negligence of the person
charged with injury is an efficient cause without which the injury
would not have resulted to as great an extent, and that such cause is
not attributable to the person injured. It is no defense to one of the
concurrent tortfeasors that the injury would not have resulted from his
negligence alone, without the negligence or wrongful acts of the other
concurrent tortfeasors. 
Where several causes producing an injury
are concurrent and each is an efficient cause without which the injury
would not have happened, the injury may be attributed to all or any of
the causes and recovery may be had against any or all of the
responsible persons although under the circumstances of the case, it
may appear that one of them was more culpable, and that the duty owed
by them to the injured person was not the same. No actorâs negligence
ceases to be a proximate cause merely because it does not exceed the
negligence of other actors. Each wrongdoer is responsible for the
entire result and is liable as though his acts were the sole cause of
the injury.

There is no contribution between joint tortfeasors whose liability is
solidary since both of them are liable for the total damage. Where the
concurrent or successive negligent acts or omissions of two or more
persons, although acting independently, are in combination with the
direct and proximate cause of a single injury to a third person, it is
impossible to determine in what proportion each contributed to the
injury and either of them is responsible for the whole injury. 
Where
their concurring negligence resulted in injury or damage to a third
party, they become joint tortfeasors and are solidarily liable for the
resulting damage under Article 2194 of the Civil Code.

All told, all the elements of 
quasi

delict have been proven by clear and convincing evidence. The CA erred
in absolving private respondents from liability for the vehicular
collision.


Final Note


It is lamentable that the vehicular collision in this case could have been easily avoided by following 
basic traffic rules and regulations

and road safety standards. In hindsight, private respondent Limbaga
could have prevented the three-way vehicular collision if he had
properly parked the prime mover on the shoulder of the national road.
The improper 
parking
 of vehicles, most especially along the
national highways, poses a serious and unnecessary risk to the lives
and limbs of other motorists and passengers. Drivers owe a duty of care
to follow basic traffic rules and regulations and to observe road
safety standards. They owe that duty not only for their own safety, but
also for that of other motorists. We can prevent most vehicular
accidents by simply following basic traffic rules and regulations.


We also note a failure of implementation of basic safety standards, particularly the law on 
early warning devices.

This applies even more to trucks and big vehicles, which are prone to
mechanical breakdown on the national highway. The law, as crafted,
requires vehicles to be equipped with triangular reflectorized plates.
[32]
 Vehicles without the required early warning devices are ineligible for registration.
[33]
 Vehicle owners may also be arrested and fined for non-compliance with the law.
[34]

The Land Transportation Office (LTO) owes a duty to the public to
ensure that all vehicles on the road meet basic and minimum safety
features, including that of early warning devices. It is most
unfortunate that We still see dilapidated and rundown vehicles on the
road with substandard safety features. These vehicles not only pose a
hazard to the safety of their occupants but that of other motorists.
The prime mover truck in this case should not have been granted
registration because it failed to comply with the minimum safety
features required for vehicles on the road.

It is, indeed, time for traffic enforcement agencies and the LTO to
strictly enforce all pertinent laws and regulations within their
mandate.
