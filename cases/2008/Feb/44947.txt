QUISUMBING, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari are the Decision
[1]
 dated October 16, 2003 and Resolution
[2]
 dated December 9, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 73906. The Court of Appeals had affirmed the Resolution
[3]

dated September 27, 2002 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Las PiÃ±as
City, Branch 202, in Land Registration Case (LRC) Case No. 02-0030, and
denied petitionersâ motion for reconsideration.


The factual antecedents of this case are as follows:


Benito J. Lopez was the registered owner of a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. S-61176,
[4]
 at Barrio Almanza, Las PiÃ±as City. On December 29, 1993, Lopez sold the land to Antonio V. Martel, Jr. for P75,000,000.
[5]
 The latter had the land subdivided into five lots for which individual titles were issued including TCT Nos. T-69568
[6]
 and T-69572,
[7]
 subjects of the present controversy.


On May 25, 1995, Martel, Jr. learned of a Decision
[8]
 dated December 8, 1994 of the Pasig RTC,
[9]

Branch 71 which granted an application for registration and
confirmation of title to parcels of land in LRC Case No. N-9049. Said
case was filed on December 9, 1975 by Teodorica, Enrique, Beatriz,
Rueben, Mario, and the heirs of Ricardo and Narciso, all surnamed
Factor, as applicants. Their claim was based on possession since time
immemorial of lands, among which was the lot covered by TCT No. T-57471
[10]
 from which the title of Benito J. Lopez emanated.

Aggrieved, Benito J. Lopez and Pepito L. Ng, joined by their spouses as
formal parties, filed on May 30, 1995 a motion for leave to admit
petition to reopen and review the decree of registration.

On January 27, 1997, the Pasig RTC reversed its earlier Order which
directed the issuance of a decree of registration in favor of the
Factors, thus:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for
Reconsideration, with Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration is
hereby DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated December 8, 1994 is
RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE. The case is ordered DISMISSED without
pronouncement as to costs.


SO ORDERED.
[11]


On the strength of this ruling, Martel, Jr. filed an 
ex parte
 petition for the issuance of a writ of possession
[12]

over the lots covered by TCT Nos. T-69568 and T-69572. The case was
docketed as LRC Case No. 02-0030 before the RTC of Las PiÃ±as City,
Branch 202, on March 15, 2002. In its Decision dated August 26, 2002,
said RTC denied relief to Martel, Jr. as follows:

WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the petition for
issuance of a writ of possession over the property covered by Transfer
Certificates of Title No. T-69568 and T-69572 of the Registry of Deeds
of Las PiÃ±as City is hereby DENIED.


SO ORDERED.
[13]


Martel, Jr. moved for reconsideration. The same was granted in a Resolution dated September 27, 2002 as follows:


WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the motion for
reconsideration is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated August 26, 2002
is set aside.

Let a writ of possession be issued in the favor of petitioner Antonio
V. Martel, Jr. and against Teodorica Factor, et al., and all persons
claiming rights under them and ordering the Deputy Sheriff of this
Court to place said petitioner in possession of the subject property.


SO ORDERED.
[14]

Petitioners Factors brought the case to the Court of Appeals on
certiorari. On October 16, 2003, the appellate court issued the
assailed Decision, the 
fallo
 of which states:


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the instant petition is hereby 
DENIED
 for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.
[15]

Pending resolution of petitionersâ motion for reconsideration, Martel,
Jr. sold the lots to Pepito L. Ng for the sum of P151,800,000
[16]
 on August 17, 2003. On December 9, 2003, the Court of Appeals denied reconsideration.


Hence, the instant petition raising the following issues:



I.


WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN ISSUING A WRIT OF POSSESSION IN LRC CASE NO. 02-0030.

II.

WHETHER OR NOT A PETITION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A WRIT OF POSSESSION IS A
PROPER ACTION TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTIES SUBJECT OF [THE]
CASE.
[17]

Simply put, petitioners are asking this Court to resolve the following
questions: (1) whether the issuance of the writ of possession was
erroneous; and (2) whether respondent had availed of the appropriate
remedy to recover possession of the lands. Both questions are
inter-related and have to be addressed jointly.

Petitioners contend that a writ of possession may be issued only
pursuant to a decree of registration in an original land registration
proceeding. They insist that the writ was erroneously issued inasmuch
as the 
ex parte

petition for its issuance was filed by Martel, Jr. outside the original
land registration proceeding which was concluded in 1905. Petitioners
stress that LRC Case No. N-9049 was brought at their instance, and is
still pending appeal; thus, no execution can be had. They contend that
Martel, Jr.âs successor Ng ought to file an action for ejectment
instead.

Ng counters that the right of a successful party in a land registration
case to ask for a writ of possession does not prescribe. He adds that
the writ may issue not only against the person defeated in the case but
also against anyone adversely occupying the land or any part thereof
during the proceeding until the final decree of registration has been
issued. He relies on petitionersâ allegation in LRC Case No. N-9049
that they and their predecessors-in-interest have been in continuous
possession of the lots since time immemorial. Consequently, they are
among those against whom the writ of possession may issue. Ng negates
laches reasoning that his predecessor immediately filed an opposition
upon learning of LRC Case No. N-9049, and applied for a writ of
possession even while the case was on appeal.


After a thorough consideration of the circumstances in this case, we agree that the petition has merit.

A writ of possession is employed to enforce a judgment to recover the
possession of land. It commands the sheriff to enter the land and give
possession of it to the person entitled under the judgment.
[18]
 It may be issued under the following instances: (1) land registration proceedings under Section 17 of Act No. 496;
[19]

(2) judicial foreclosure, provided the debtor is in possession of the
mortgaged realty and no third person, not a party to the foreclosure
suit, had intervened; (3) extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate
mortgage under Section 7 of Act No. 3135
[20]
 as amended by Act No. 4118;
[21]
 and (4) in execution sales.

In land registration proceedings, a writ of possession is an order
issued by the RTC directing the sheriff to place the applicant or
oppositors, or whoever is the successful litigant, in possession of the
property.
[22]


In this case, Ng advanced two grounds for the allowance of the 
ex parte

petition for a writ of possession: (1) a writ has yet to be issued to
enforce the decree of registration awarded to his
predecessors-in-interest in the original land registration proceedings;
and (2) the Court of Appeals favorably resolved Martel, Jr.âs
opposition to the registration of the lots in the name of petitioners.

Ng invokes Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 25 issued on January
20, 1905 by virtue of Decree No. 428 in the original land registration
case. OCT No. 25 is the title from which TCT No. S-61176 in the name of
Benito J. Lopez, and thereafter TCT Nos. T-69568 and T-69572 in the
name of his predecessor, Martel, Jr., were derived. Ngâs invocation
rests on petitionersâ claim that they and their
predecessors-in-interest had continuously possessed the lots since time
immemorial; thus, by tacking the latterâs possession to petitioners, a
writ of possession may issue against petitioners who are considered
adverse possessors of the lots even prior to the issuance of the decree
in 1905. On this point, however, we are unable to agree with Ng.

It is well established that a writ of possession may be issued only
pursuant to a decree of registration in original land registration
proceedings not only against the person who has been defeated in a
registration case but also against anyone adversely occupying the land
or any portion thereof during the proceedings up to the issuance of the
decree.
[23]

Here, petitioners applied for registration and confirmation of the land
covered by TCT No. S-61176 in 1975, long after the decree of
registration was issued in 1905. Neither were petitioners parties to
the original registration case. Clearly, they are not the adverse
occupants contemplated by law against whom a writ of possession may be
enforced. Hence, the appellate court erred gravely when it issued a
writ of possession in favor of Martel, Jr.

It is a settled rule that when parties against whom a writ of
possession is sought have been in possession of the land for at least
10 years, and they entered into possession apparently after the
issuance of the final decree, and none of them had been a party in the
registration proceedings, the writ of possession will not issue. A
person who took possession of the land after final adjudication of the
same in registration proceedings cannot be summarily ousted through a
writ of possession secured by a mere motion. Regardless of any title or
lack of title of persons to hold possession of the land in question,
they cannot be ousted without giving them their day in court in the
proper independent proceedings.
[24]


Ngâs predecessor, Martel, Jr., filed the 
ex parte

petition to implement the Order dated January 27, 1997 of the Pasig RTC
in LRC Case No. N-9049. The Order confirmed ownership of the lots in
Martel, Jr.âs predecessor, Lopez. In a Manifestation dated August 15,
2007, Ng informed this Court that the Court of Appeals had affirmed the
decision in LRC Case No. N-9049. Ultimately, he wants us to execute the
Pasig RTC decision in LRC Case No. N-9049 through the petition before
the Las PiÃ±as RTC in LRC Case No. 02-0030. However, such a procedural
short-cut cannot be done.


Noteworthy, Section 34 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 provides:


SEC. 34. 
Rules of procedure. â
 The Rules of Court
shall, insofar as not inconsistent with the provisions of this Decree,
be applicable to land registration and cadastral cases by analogy or in
a suppletory character and whenever practicable and convenient.


Thus, Section 1, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court is pertinent:


SECTION 1
. 
Execution upon judgments or final orders.

--- Execution shall issue as a matter of right, on motion, upon a
judgment or order that disposes of the action or proceeding upon the
expiration of the period to appeal therefrom if no appeal has been duly
perfected.

If the appeal has been duly perfected and finally resolved, the
execution may forthwith be applied for in the court of origin, on
motion of the judgment obligee, submitting therewith certified true
copies of the judgment or judgments or final orders sought to be
enforced and of the entry thereof, with notice to the adverse party.

The appellate court may, on motion in the same case, when the interest
of justice so requires, direct the court of origin to issue the writ of
execution. (Emphasis supplied).

Nothing in Ngâs manifestation indicated that the appellate courtâs
decision has become final and executory. Besides, even if the same has
become final, a writ of possession remains unavailing as the motion for
its issuance was not filed in the same case for which execution was
sought.

Pending the final outcome of LRC Case No. N-9049, the only remedy by
which Ng can take possession of the lots is through an accion 
reinvindicatoria
 against petitioners. 
Accion reinvindicatoria

is an action to recover ownership over real property, which must be
filed in the RTC where the realty is situated. This is so because a
writ of possession cannot issue against possessors who claim ownership.
Actual possession under claim of ownership raises a disputable
presumption of ownership and the true owner must resort to judicial
process for the recovery of the property, not summarily through a
motion for the issuance of a writ of possession.
[25]


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
GRANTED.
 The Decision dated October 16, 2003, and Resolution dated December 9, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 73906 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE.
 LRC Case No. 02-0030 is hereby

 The Land Registration Act.

Sec. 17. The Court of Land Registration, in all matters over which it
has jurisdiction, may enforce its orders, judgments, or decrees in the
same manner as orders, judgments, and decrees are enforced in the
Courts of First Instance, 
including
a writ of possession directing the governor or sheriff of any province
or of the city of Manila to place the applicant in possession of the
property covered by a decree of the court in his favor
 and, upon
the request of the judge of the Court of Land Registration, the
governor or sheriff of any province or of the city of Manila, as the
case may be, shall assign a deputy to attend the sittings of the court
in that province or city. The governor or sheriff of the province who
shall, in person or by his deputy, attend the sittings of the court in
any province outside the city of Manila, in accordance with the
provisions of this section, shall be allowed three dollars per day, in
money of the United States, for each day the courts is in session in
his province for attendance by himself and necessary deputies. This
allowance shall be in addition to the fees for service of process, and
shall be paid from the provincial treasury.


[20]
 AN ACT TO REGULATE THE SALE OF PROPERTY UNDER SPECIAL POWERS INSERTED IN OR ANNEXED TO REAL-ESTATE MORTGAGES.

Sec. 7. In any sale made under the provisions of this Act, the
purchaser may petition the Court of First Instance of the province or
place where the property or any part thereof is situated, to give him
possession thereof during the redemption period, furnishing bond in an
amount equivalent to the use of the property for a period of twelve
months, to indemnify the debtor in case it be shown that the sale was
made without violating the mortgage or without complying with the
requirements of this Act. Such petition shall be made under oath and
filed in form of an ex parte motion in the registration or cadastral
proceedings if the property is registered, or in special proceedings in
the case of property registered under the Mortgage Law or under section
one hundred and ninety-four of the Administrative Code, or of any other
real property encumbered with a mortgage duly registered in the office
of any register of deeds in accordance with any existing law, and in
each case the clerk of the court shall, upon the filing of such
petition, collect the fees specified in paragraph eleven of section one
hundred and fourteen of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six, as
amended by Act Numbered Twenty-eight hundred and sixty-six, and the
court shall, upon approval of the bond, order that a writ of possession
issue, addressed to the sheriff of the province in which the property
is situated, who shall execute said order immediately.
