CORONA, J.:


In the late 1990s, respondent Polo Coconut Plantation Co., Inc. (PCPCI) sought to convert 280 hectares of its Polo Coconut Plantation
[7]
 (Polo estate) in Tanjay, Negros Oriental into a special economic zone (ecozone) under the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). On December 19, 1998, PEZA issued Resolution No. 98-320 favorably recommending the conversion of the Polo estate into an ecozone
[8]
 subject to certain terms and conditions including the submission of "all government clearances, endorsements and documents required under Rule IV, Section 3 of the Rules and Regulations to Implement Republic Act (RA) 7916."
The following year, PCPCI applied for the reclassification of its agricultural lands into mixed residential, commercial and industrial lands with the municipal government of Tanjay.  After conducting the prescribed hearing, the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 of Tanjay adopted Resolution No. 344 granting PCPCI's application on November 3, 1999.
When Tanjay became a city, its 
Sangguniang Panglungsod 
adopted Resolution No. 16 approving Tanjay's Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance where PCPCI's real properties, including the Polo estate, were reclassified as mixed residential, commercial and industrial lands.
[9]
Sometime in 2003, petitioner Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), through Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer Stephen M. Leonidas, notified PCPCI that 394.9020 hectares of the Polo estate had been placed under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP)
[10]
 and would be acquired by the government.
Thereafter, Leonidas requested the Registrar of Deeds of Negros Oriental to cancel PCPCI's certificate of title and to issue a new one in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. He likewise asked Region VII Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator Arnold C. Arrieta to determine the just compensation due to PCPCI.
[11]
On January 29, 2004, a new certificate of title was issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.
[12]
 The next day, that title was cancelled and another was issued in the name of petitioners in G.R. No. 169271 (petitioners-beneficiaries).
[13]
Meanwhile, on March 11, 2004, Arrieta approved the land valuation (P85,491,784.60)
[14]
 of the Land Bank of the Philippines for the Polo estate. PCPCI moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated March 30, 2004.
On July 16, 2004, Leonidas informed PCPCI that a relocation survey of the Polo estate would be conducted.  PCPCI moved for the suspension of the survey but it was denied.
[15]
Aggrieved, PCPCI filed a petition for certiorari
[16]
 in the Court of Appeals (CA) asserting that the DAR acted with grave abuse of discretion in placing the Polo estate under the CARP. It argued that the Polo estate should not be subjected to the CARP because Resolution No. 16 had already designated it as mixed residential, commercial and industrial land. Moreover, petitioners-beneficiaries were not qualified to receive land under the CARP.
In its February 16, 2005 decision, the CA found that the Polo estate was no longer agricultural land when the DAR placed it under the CARP in view of Resolution No. 16. Furthermore, petitioners-beneficiaries were not qualified beneficiaries as they were not tenants of PCPCI. Thus:
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us 
DECLARING 
as 
NOT VALID 
the acts of the [DAR] of subjecting PCPCI's [Polo estate] to the coverage of the CARP, of canceling and causing the cancellation of [PCPCI's] Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2304 covering such land, of issuing or causing the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-36318 for this land in the name of the Republic of the Philippines by way of transfer to it, of issuing or causing the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-802 for the said land in the names of [petitioner-beneficiaries] in the case at bench by way of award of them of such land as purported farm beneficiaries and of doing other things with the end in view of subjecting [the Polo estate] to CARP coverage, 
SETTING ASIDE 
and 
ENJOINING 
such acts and the consequence thereof, 
ORDERING 
the [petitioner-beneficiaries] to vacate the premises of [the Polo estate] if they had entered such premises, and 
ORDERING 
the respondent Register of Deeds of Negros Oriental to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-36318 and T-802 and to reinstate Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2304 in the name of petitioner PCPCI.
SO ORDERED.
[17]
Both the DAR and petitioners-beneficiaries moved for reconsideration but they were denied.
[18]
 Hence, this recourse.
The DAR asserts that the reclassification of the Polo estate under Resolution No. 16 as mixed residential, commercial and industrial land did not place it beyond the reach of the CARP. Petitioners-beneficiaries, on the other hand, insist that they were qualified beneficiaries. While they were neither farmers nor regular farmworkers of PCPCI, they were either seasonal or other farmworkers.
There is merit in these petitions.
NON-EXHAUSTION OF 
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES  
Recourse to court action will not prosper until all remedies have been exhausted at the administrative level.
[19]
Section 3, Rule II of the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure (DARAB Rules) provides:
Section 3. Agrarian Law Implementation Cases. The Adjudicator or Board shall have no jurisdiction over matters involving the implementation of RA 6657 otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) of 1988 and other related agrarian laws enunciated by pertinent rules and administrative orders, which shall be under the 
exclusive prerogative of and cognizable by the Office of the Secretary of the DAR
 in accordance with his issuances to wit:
3.1. Classification and identification of landholdings for coverage under the agrarian reform program and the initial issuance of [certificates of land ownership award] and [emancipation patents], including protests or oppositions thereto and petitioners for lifting of such coverage;
3.2. Classification, identification, inclusion, exclusion, qualification or disqualification of potential/actual farmer/beneficiaries; (emphasis supplied)
x x x       x x x       x x x
Protests regarding the implementation of the CARP fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DAR Secretary. He determines whether a tract of land is covered by or exempt from CARP.
[20]
  Likewise, questions regarding the eligibility of CARP beneficiaries must be addressed to him. The DAR Secretary decides to whom lands placed under the CARP shall be distributed.
[21]
Before PCPCI filed its petition for certiorari in the CA, it did not file a protest or opposition questioning the propriety of subjecting the Polo estate to the CARP.  Neither did it assail the eligibility of petitioners-beneficiaries before the DAR Secretary.  There were available administrative remedies under the DARAB Rules but PCPCI did not avail of them.
Moreover, a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court can be availed of only in the absence of an appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[22]
 Here, recourse to the DAR Secretary was the plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law contemplated by Rule 65.
NON-CONVERSION TO MIXED 
RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND
INDUSTRIAL LAND
In 
Ros v. DAR,
[23]
 we held that reclassified agricultural lands must undergo the process of conversion in the DAR
[24]
 before they may be used for other purposes.
[25]
 Since the DAR never approved the conversion of the Polo estate from agricultural to another use, the land was never placed beyond the scope of the CARP.
The approval of the DAR for the conversion of agricultural land into an industrial estate is a condition precedent for its conversion into an ecozone.
[26]
 A proposed ecozone cannot be considered for Presidential Proclamation unless the landowner first submits to PEZA a land use conversion clearance certificate from the DAR.
[27]
 This PCPCI failed to do.
PEZA Resolution No. 98-320 expressly provides:
Resolved, that the application of [PCPCI] for (1) declaration of the 280-hectare property in Brgy. Polo, Municipality of Tanjay, Province of Negros Oriental as a Special Economic Zone, subject to Presidential Proclamation, henceforth to be to be known as 
POLO ECOCITY- SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE
 and (2) registration as the Developer/Owner of the said ECOZONE is hereby 
APPROVED
 subject to the following terms and conditions:
x x x       x x x        x x x
2. Prior to PEZA's endorsement of the subject area to the President for proclamation as an ECOZONE, the PCPCI shall submit all government clearances, endorsements and documents required under Rule IV, Section 3 of the [Rules and Regulations to Implement RA 7916];
x x x        x x x       x x x
This condition proves that the favorable recommendation of PEZA did not 
ipso facto
 change the nature of the Polo estate. The property remained as agricultural land and, for this reason, was still subject to the CARP.
In fact, Resolution No. 16 did not exempt PCPCI's agricultural lands (including the Polo estate) from the CARP. Section 20 of the Local Government Code
[28]
 provides that a city or municipality can reclassify land only through the enactment of an ordinance. In this instance, reclassification was undertaken by mere resolution;
[29]
 thus, it was invalid.
QUALIFICATION OF CARP BENEFICIARIES
Section 22 of the CARL provides:
Section 22. 
Qualified Beneficiaries.
 - The lands covered by the CARP shall be distributed as much as possible to landless residents of the same baranggay, or in the absence thereof, landless residents of the same municipality in the following order of priority:
(a) agricultural lessees and share tenants;
(b) regular farmworkers;
(c) seasonal farmworkers;
(d) other farmworkers;
(e) actual tillers or occupants of public lands;
(f) collectives or cooperatives of the abovementioned beneficiaries and
(g) others directly working on the land.
x x x       x x x       x x x
A basic qualification of a beneficiary is his willingness, aptitude and ability to cultivate and make the land as productive as possible. The DAR shall adopt a system of monitoring the record or performance of each beneficiary, so that any beneficiary guilty of negligence or misuse of the land or any support extended to him shall forfeit his right to continue as such beneficiary. The DAR shall submit periodic reports on the performance of the beneficiaries to the [Presidential Agrarian Reform Council].
x x x       x x x        x x x
This provision enumerates who are qualified beneficiaries of the CARP. Determining whether or not one is eligible to receive land involves the administrative implementation of the program. For this reason, only the DAR Secretary can identify and select CARP beneficiaries.  Thus, courts cannot substitute their judgment unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion.
[30]
Section 22 of the CARL does not limit qualified beneficiaries to tenants of the landowners. Thus, the DAR cannot be deemed to have committed grave abuse of discretion simply because its chosen beneficiaries were not tenants of PCPCI.
WHEREFORE
, the petitions are hereby 
GRANTED. 
The February 16, 2005 decision and June 29, 2005 resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-SP No. 00043 are

Reclassification of Lands. 
(a) 
A city or municipality may, through an ordinance passed by the sanggunian after conducting public hearings for the purpose, authorize the reclassification of agricultural lands 
and provide for the manner of their utilization  or disposition in the following cases: (1) when the land ceases to be economically feasible and sound for agricultural purposes as determined by the Department of Agriculture or (2) where the land shall have substantially greater economic value for residential, commercial or industrial purposes, as determined by the

 A municipal ordinance is different from a resolution.  An ordinance is a law, but a resolution is merely a declaration of the sentiment or opinion of a lawmaking body on a specific matter.  An ordinance possesses a general and permanent character, but a resolution is temporary in nature.  Additionally, the two are enacted differently - a third reading is necessary for an ordinance, but not for a resolution, unless decided otherwise by a majority of all the 
Sanggunian
 members.  (
