[3]
From the 6 February 2007 Decision of the Third Division, the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) filed an Omnibus Motion seeking the (a) reconsideration of the said decision; (b) referral of the case to the Supreme Court sitting 
en banc
; and (c) setting of its motion for oral argument.
[4]
In its 19 December 2007 Resolution, the Third Division partially granted the Motion for Reconsideration of LBP by modifying its 6 February 2007 Decision, and ruled:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration is PARTIALLY GRANTED as follows:
(1) The award of 12% interest rate per annum in the total amount of just compensation is DELETED.
(2) This case is ordered REMANDED to the RTC for further hearing on the amount of Commissioners' Fees.
(3) The award of attorney's fees is DELETED.
(4) The Motion for Referral of the case to the Supreme Court sitting En Banc and the request or setting of the Omnibus Motion for Oral Arguments are all DENIED for lack of merit. In all other respects, our Decision dated 6 February 2007 is MAINTAINED.
[5]
Consequently, all the parties sought reconsideration of the afore-quoted Resolution.
LBP filed another Omnibus Motion seeking (a) reconsideration of the Resolution dated 19 December 2007 of the Third Division denying LBP's motion to refer the case to the Supreme Court 
en banc
; and (b) leave of court to file a second Motion for Reconsideration
[6]
 on the issue of just compensation for the subject properties. LBP thus prays -
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court (Third Division), TO REFER this case to the Honorable Court sitting En Banc, and upon referral thereof, for this Honorable Court sitting En Banc to rule as follows:
 ALLOW respondent LBP to file a Second Motion for Reconsideration on the issue of just compensation for subject properties, and ADMIT and CONSIDER the said motion in the resolution of the instant case;
 RECONSIDER the Resolution dated 19 December 2007 which affirmed the Special Agrarian Court's valuation for subject properties amounting to One Billion Three Hundred Eighty Three Million One Hundred Seventy Nine Thousand Pesos (Php1,383,179,000.00) which is almost TRIPLE the landowner-petitioners' offered sum of only Four Hundred Sixty Eight Million Pesos (Php468,000,000.00) as just compensation for subject properties under the Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS) Scheme;
 AFFIRM in toto respondent LBP's revaluation for subject properties amounting to Four Hundred Eleven Million Seven Hundred Sixty Nine Thousand One Hundred Sixty Eight Pesos & 32/100 (Php411,769,168.32) as just compensation.
[7]
On the other hand, AFC and HPI filed their Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 19 December 2007, based on the following grounds:
I.
PETITIONERS RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THE HONORABLE COURT MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED MATERIAL FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEREFORE ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT:
 PETITIONERS' RECOURSE TO THE DARAB, AFTER REJECTING THE INITIAL VALUATIONS OF RESPONDENT LBP, IS WARRANTED UNDER EXISTING LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN THE TWO COMPLAINTS FOR DETERMINATION OF THE JUST COMPENSATION WERE FILED ON 14 FEBRUARY 1997 WITH DARAB.
 AT THE VERY LEAST, LBP SHOULD BE MADE TO PAY TWELVE PERCENT (12%) INTEREST ON THE BALANCE OF P975,223,885.21 (REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE JUDGMENT AWARD OF P1,383,179,000.00 AND THE AMOUNT ALREADY PAID FOR THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES TOTALING P407,955,114.79.
II.
RESPONDENT LBP DELIBERATELY DELAYED THE PROCEEDINGS, THUS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO MAKE A PROMPT AND FULL PAYMENT OF JUST COMPENSATION; THIS FACT ALONE SHOULD WARRANT THE AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES.
[8]
While all the foregoing motions were still pending resolution, the LPB filed on 28 February 2008 a very urgent/verified motion/application for issuance of temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction, praying that this Court -
a) ISSUE a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction, to enjoin during the pendency of the proceedings and until the issue raised on appeal and the amount of just compensation of subject property are finally resolved, Hon. Justino G. Aventurado, Judge, Regional Trial Court of Tagum City, Davao del Norte, Branch 2, Sheriffs and/or all persons acting on his behalf, from executing the Partial Writ of Execution implementing the Resolution dated 19 December 2007.
b) QUASH or INVALIDATE the Notices of Garnishment dated 27 February 2008 and similar notices covering "goods, effects, interests, credits, monies, stocks, shares, any interests in shares and stocks, and any other personal properties" in the name of respondent LBP which are in the possession of the Treasurer of the Philippines, Deutsche Bank, and other financial institutions.
[9]
On 12 March 2008, this Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order -
[E]njoining Hon. Justino G. aventurado, Judge, Regional Trial Court of Tagum City, Davao del Norte, Branch 2, Sheriffs and all persons acting on his behalf from implementing the Partial Writ of Execution dated 26 February 2008 effective immediately and to DIRECT the parties and all concerned to MAINTAIN the STATUS QUO prior to the issuance of the notice of Garnishment to different financial institutions or entities dated 27 February 2008 until further orders from this Court.
[10]
The Court shall now resolve the pending motions of LBP, AFC and HPI.
As to LBP's Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 19 December 2007 denying its Motion for the referral of the case to the Supreme Court 
en banc
, LBP argues that the reversal of the Supreme Court's rulings in 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Sps. Banal,
[11]
 Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada
[12]
 and 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim,
[13]
 constitute a clear and significant constitutional issue that should be passed upon by this Court sitting 
en banc
 pursuant to Article VIII, Section 4(2) of the 1987 Constitution mandating that "no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the court in a decision rendered 
en banc
 or in division may be modified or reversed except by the court sitting 
en banc
."
The argument of LBP is without basis.
The Third Division has explained at length in its 19 December 2007 Resolution that:
[I]t is abundantly clear that this case does not in any way modify or reverse our holdings in 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal
 and 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada
. To reiterate, in 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada
, the RTC acting as SAC arrived at the determination of just compensation based only on one single factor, namely, its observation that there was a patent disparity between the price given to the landowner as compared to the other landowners in that case. This is not true in the present case as we have repeatedly held that the RTC acting as SAC considered all material and relevant factors to arrive at a correct and proper determination of just compensation. On the other hand, in 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal
, the valuation of the RTC acting as SAC was set aside for the reason that the same was arrived at without a hearing and based only on the memoranda of the parties. In this case, the trial court conducted several hearings and ocular inspections before it rendered its decision.
[14]
Similarly, the Resolution dated 19 December 2007 of the Third Division, refusing to reconsider its Decision dated 6 February 2007, on the just compensation due to AFC and HPI, does not effectively reverse the Court's 
en banc
 Decision in 
Lim
,
[15]
 contrary to the persistent averment of the LBP.
The Third Division is not evading the prescription in
 Lim
. As is stark in the assailed 
ponencia
, the Court affirmed the due consideration given by the RTC of the factors specified in Section 17, Republic Act No. 6657. Again, the proper valuation of the subject premises was reached with clear regard for the acquisition cost of the land, current market value of the properties, its nature, actual use and income, 
inter alia - 
factors that are material and relevant in determining just compensation. These are the very same factors laid down in a formula by DAR A.O. No. 5. Due regard was thus given by the RTC to Republic Act No. 6657, DAR A.O. No. 5 and prevailing jurisprudence when it arrived at the value of just compensation due to AFC and HPI in this case.
Moreover, the Court 
en banc
 in 
Luz Lim
 found that the RTC erred in determining the just compensation due therein respondents, by simply adopting the price previously paid by therein petitioner LBP for the land of respondents' brother, absolutely disregarding the mandatory factors in the appropriate administrative orders. While the RTC therein did refer to other factors which it supposedly considered, ultimately, it only made use of the same value paid by the LBP for the land of respondents' brother. The same is not true in this case. It cannot be said herein that the RTC anchored its determination of just compensation for the land of AFC and HPI on only one particular factor.
Given the differences in the factual background of the case at bar and those cited by LBP, it cannot be said that the Third Division is reversing any doctrine or principle laid down by jurisprudence. There is therefore no basis for the prayer of LBP to refer the case to the Supreme Court 
en banc
. The Supreme Court sitting 
En Banc
 is not an appellate court 
vis-Ã -vis
 its Divisions, and it exercises no appellate jurisdiction over the latter. Each division of the Court is considered not a body inferior to the Court 
en banc
, and sits veritably as the Court 
en banc
 itself.
[16]
 It bears to stress further that a resolution of the Division denying a party's motion for referral to the Court 
en banc
 of any Division case, shall be final and not appealable to the Court 
en banc
.
[17]
 Since, at this point, the Third Division already 
twice
 denied the motion of LBP to refer the present Petition to the Supreme Court 
en banc
, the same must already be deemed final for no more appeal of its denial thereof is available to LBP.
In addition, the Omnibus Motion of LBP, to the extent that it seeks reconsideration of the amount of just compensation which the Court affirmed in its Decision dated 6 February 2007, is a second motion for reconsideration, because the Court already denied an identical prayer in its previous Resolution dated 19 December 2007. Thus, the prayer of LBP for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration must be denied for a second motion for reconsideration is a prohibited pleading under Rule 52, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, which provides that, "No second motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained."
Anent AFC and HPI's Motion for Partial Reconsideration praying for the reinstatement of the award of interest and attorney's fees, the Court finds the same to be devoid of merit.
The Court has already thoroughly discussed in its 19 December 2007 Resolution the reasons for reversing its award to AFC and HPI of interest and attorney's fees. It has duly considered all matters attendant to these issues in its assailed 19 December 2007 Resolution, and since AFC and HPI failed to present any new arguments thereon, there is no reason for the Court to delve further on the same.
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Court hereby 
DENIES WITH FINALITY
 the following:
 The Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration of Land Bank of the Philippines, for being a second motion for reconsideration, which is a prohibited pleading; and
 The Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Apo Fruits Corporation and Hijo Plantation, Inc., for being without merit.
Necessarily, the Court 
LIFTS
 the Temporary Restraining Order it issued dated 12 March 2008. Let entry of judgment be made in this case in due course.
SO ORDERED.
