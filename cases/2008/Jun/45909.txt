[3]
It is an important sense of the agreement that the fishpond will be managed by the two lessees jointly. Jimenez was charged with the management of a 40-hectare portion of the fishpond, situated at Sitio Simelyahan, 
Barangay
 Sto. Rosario, and in Sitios Mapait and Elman, 
Barangay
 Bamban, all in the Municipality of Masinloc, Zambales.  The remaining portions of petitioner's landholding were to be managed by Hilario.
In the meantime, the Philippine Congress enacted Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL).
[4]
  The social legislation was founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other farm workers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof.  It aimed to undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, having taken into account ecological, developmental, and equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation.
[5]
On September 26, 1989, petitioner, through its president Segundo Seangio, applied for exemption from the coverage of the agrarian reform program.
[6]
  The request was reiterated via a letter dated October 17, 1989, addressed to Justice Milagros A. German, Senior Special Consultant and Adviser in Legal Affairs, Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR).
[7]
On November 10, 1989, the DAR, speaking through Justice German, acted favorably on petitioner's application for exemption.  Consequently, the DAR advised the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of Masinloc to observe the status 
quo 
and defer the inclusion of petitioner's fishpond in the compulsory acquisition program.
Sometime in 1990, Jimenez hired respondents, namely: Bernardo Jimenez, Robert Belenbough, Leonard Mijares, Eduardo Jimenez, Jose Cruz, Elizalde Edquibal, Dominador Elgincolin and Geronimo Darilag, to work as farmworkers in the fishpond.
[8]
  As farmworkers, respondents each received a monthly allowance of P1,500.00 from David Jimenez, as well as 50% of the fishpond's net proceeds from the total fish harvests, which they divided equally among themselves.
[9]
In April 1994, they were required by David Jimenez to vacate the fishpond on or before May 1, 1994.  The demand to vacate was made due to the impending expiration of Jimenez's civil law lease over the property with petitioner.
[10]
Respondents were not agreeable to the demand to vacate. Accordingly, on April 25, 1994, they filed a complaint directly against petitioner for maintenance of possession before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (PARAD) in Iba, Zambales.
[11]
 In their complaint, they contended, 
inter alia
, that they are entitled to security of tenure; and that the fishpond is covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under R.A. No. 6657.
They prayed that the entire fishpond of petitioner be placed under the coverage of the CARP; that they be considered as farmer beneficiaries who are entitled to be awarded the fishpond; and that they be allowed to remain in possession of the fishpond.
[12]
In its Answer, petitioner averred that its lessees over the fishpond were only David Jimenez and one Noel Hilario and that its lease agreement with said lessees was not agrarian but civil in nature.  It also posited that the fishpond, being a commercial one, is not yet subject to compulsory acquisition under the CARP pursuant to Section 11 of R.A. No. 6657.
[13]
  Petitioner alleged that respondents' entry into and occupation of the fishpond, as well as their enjoyment of the fish produced, was without its knowledge and consent.
[14]
On July 18, 1994, the PARAD ruled in favor of petitioner (defendant) and against respondents (plaintiffs), dismissing the complaint for lack of merit.  The 
fallo
 of the PARAD's decision reads:
WHEREFORE, this Forum is constrained to rule out plaintiffs' allegation as a regular farmworker pursuant to R.A. 6657 and/or tenants of herein defendant and to deny prayer for placing the landholding of the defendant under CARP coverage which is purely administrative and only cognizable by the Department of Agrarian Reform, as there are no concrete evidence. Thus, a judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING plaintiffs' complaint for lack of merit.
SO DECIDED.
[15]
The PARAD ruled that respondents are not agricultural leasehold tenants who may be entitled to security of tenure.  According to the PARAD, petitioner, as landowner, did not consent to the hiring of respondents, as farmworkers, by its civil law lessee, David Jimenez. The PARAD declared:
The original lessees in the Contract of Lease (Annex "A") with the lessor-defendant are David Jimenez and Noel Hilario, who are both residents of Obando, Bulacan.  The said contract expired on May 01, 1994.  Paragraph 7 of the contract of lease provides that, "consequently, the lessees shall not sublet the property, nor allow any person, firm or corporation to occupy the same in whole or in part nor shall the lessees assign in whole or in part any of their right under this Contract and no right or interest thereto or therein shall be conferred or vested in anyone by the lessees either by operation of law or otherwise."  The provision was totally violated by the lessee David Jimenez when the plaintiff(s) were admittedly hired as farmworkers.  The plaintiffs consist of David Jimenez' sons Bernardo and Eduardo Jimenez, his son-in-law Leonard Mijares and Robert Belenbough, Jose Cruz, Elizalde Edquibal, Dominador Elgincolin and Geronimo Darilag.  Noticeable from the evidence submitted that all the plaintiffs are not residents of Zambales where the subject landholding are situated.
Consequently, because of the violation of the contract, the plaintiffs are not even recognized by the defendant.  Plaintiffs' allegation to be (
sic
) tenant necessarily failed and has no leg to stand. (
sic
).  Plainly, consent of a landowner which is an essential element of tenancy is not attendant.
[16]
On appeal to the DARAB, the PARAD's decision was reversed and set aside.  The dispositive part of the DARAB decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered and finding reversible errors, (
sic
) committed by the Adjudicator a quo, the assailed decision is hereby REVERSED and a new judgment is rendered directing the PAG-ASA Fishpond Corporation, Incorporated (
sic
) through its President and Officers, to respect the peaceful possession, cultivation and enjoyment of the subject landholding by the petitioners-appellants who are the tenants thereof.
SO ORDERED.
[17]
The DARAB ruled that respondents are agricultural leasehold tenants of the subject property who deserve the protective mantle of the law despite the fact that only the civil law lessee installed them as such.  It ratiocinated:
x x x  plaintiffs-appellants are, by operation of law, tenant-farmers of the subject landholding, notwithstanding that it was a civil law lessee, who installed them therein.  When all the elements the (
sic
) tenancy relation are present, then the protective mantle of the security of tenure as guaranteed by the 1987 Charter shall be available to them.  x x x
x x x x
Verily, Sections 6 and 7 of Republic Act (RA) No. 3844 explicit (
sic
) provides, thus:
"Section 6. 
Parties to Agricultural Leasehold Relation
. - The agricultural leasehold relation shall be limited to the person who furnished the landholding, either as owner, civil law lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor and the person who personally cultivates the same."
and
Section 7. 
Tenure of Agricultural Leasehold Relation
. - The Agricultural leasehold relation once established shall confer upon the agricultural lessee the right to continue working on the landholding until such leasehold relation is extinguished, the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to security of tenure on his landholding and cannot be ejected therefrom unless authorized by the Court for causes herein provided."
[18]
When petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied
[19]
 by the DARAB on January 17, 2001, they appealed to the CA via petition for review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
Petitioner insisted that respondents were not tenants on the property. It argued anew that it was not a party to any tenancy relationship with anyone 
vis-Ã -vis
 the subject property; and that it had not received any share in the fishpond's harvests from respondents.
CA Disposition
In a Decision dated March 30, 2004, the CA affirmed the DARAB decision, disposing as follows:
Once a tenancy relationship is established, therefore, the tenant is entitled to security of tenure and cannot be ejected unless upon judicial authority for causes provided by law.  The reliance of the petitioner on 
Sanchez v. Court of Appeals
, 
supra
, is, consequently misplaced, since that doctrine was applicable only to the hired laborers of a civil law lessee, not to bona fide share or leasehold tenants like the respondents.
WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.
[20]
The CA opined that although petitioner was not privy to a tenancy relationship with respondents, its civil law lessee, David Jimenez, made respondents the agricultural leasehold tenants in the property.  The CA concluded that David Jimenez, being the legal possessor of the fishpond as defined under Section 42 of R.A. No. 1199, has the authority to hire agricultural leasehold tenants and to bring about agricultural leasehold relations.  This relation, according to the appellate court, is binding upon the landowner, petitioner, which effectively became obliged to respect the rights of the tenants. Among said rights is the right to security of tenure.
The CA pointed out:
Finally, although the petitioner is correct in positing that the lease was one under the civil law, rather than an agricultural lease, the expiration of the lease did not negate the right of the respondents to security of tenure as the bona fide tenants.
According to Sec. 8, Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as The Agricultural Land Reform Code, a leasehold relation, once established, can be terminated on the following grounds, to wit:
 
Abandonment of the landholding without the knowledge of the agricultural lessor;
Voluntary surrender of the landholding by the agricultural lessee, written notice of which shall be served 3 months in advance; or
Absence of an heir to succeed the lessee in the event of his/her death of permanent incapacity.
Aggrieved, petitioners moved for reconsideration. The motion was, however, denied by the appellate court via Resolution
[21]
 dated August 5, 2004.  Hence, the present recourse under Rule 45.
Issues
Petitioner now contends that:
I
THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT APPLYING THE HONORABLE COURT'S RULING IN THE RECENT CASE OF 
VALENCIA
 VS. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL.
, 401 SCRA 666, WHICH APPLIES SQUARELY TO THE FACTS IN THE INSTANT CASE, THAT SECTION 6 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 3844, AS AMENDED, DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZE A CIVIL LAW LESSEE TO EMPLOY A TENANT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LANDOWNER.  ACCORDINGLY, AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE CIVIL LAW LEASE, PETITIONER WAS NOT BOUND BY THE ALLEGED TENANCY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESPONDENTS AND THE CIVIL LAW LESSEE WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO WITHOUT ITS CONSENT.
II
THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT RESPONDENTS ARE SHARE TENANTS WHO ARE ENTITLED TO SECURITY OF TENURE.
III
THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT APPLYING THE RULING OF THE HONORABLE COURT IN THE CASE OF 
SANCHEZ VS. COURT OF APPEALS
, 129 SCRA 717 TO THE INSTANT CASE.
[22]
Our Ruling
Before We begin to consider the issues hoisted by petitioner, the Court takes cognizance of a pivotal question of jurisdiction.  We resolve this issue 
motu
 proprio
, even if it was not raised by the parties nor threshed out in their pleadings.
[23]
The jurisdiction of the PARAD, DARAB and the CA on appeal, is limited to agrarian disputes or controversies and other matters or incidents involving the implementation of the CARP under R.A. No. 6657, R.A. No. 3844 and other agrarian laws.
[24]
  An agrarian dispute is defined as any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farm workers associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.
[25]
As early as February 20, 1995, private lands actually, directly and exclusively used for prawn farms and fishponds were exempted from the coverage of the CARL by virtue of R.A. No. 7881.
[26]
 Section 2 of the said law expressly provides:
Sec. 2. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 6657 is hereby amended to read as follows:
"Sec. 10.  Exemptions and Exclusions. -
a)         Lands actually, directly and exclusively used for parks, wildlife, forest reserves, reforestation, fish sanctuaries and breeding grounds, watersheds and mangroves shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.
b)         Private lands actually, directly and exclusively used for prawn farms and fishponds shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act: Provided, That said prawn farms and fishponds have not been distributed and Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) issued to agrarian reform beneficiaries under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.
In cases where the fishponds or prawn farms have been subjected to the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, by voluntary offer to sell, or commercial farms deferment or notices of compulsory acquisition, a simple and absolute majority of the actual regular workers or tenants must consent to the exemption within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act.  When the workers or tenants do not agree to this exemption, the fishponds or prawn farms shall be distributed collectively to the worker-beneficiaries or tenants who shall form a cooperative or association to manage the same.
In cases where the fishponds or prawn farms have not been subjected to the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the consent of the farm workers shall no longer be necessary, however, the provision of Section 32-A hereof on incentives shall apply.
c)         Lands actually, directly and exclusively used and found to be necessary for national defense, school sites and campuses, including experimental farm stations operated by public or private schools for educational purposes, seeds and seedling research and pilot production center, church sites and convents appurtenant thereto, mosque sites and Islamic centers appurtenant thereto, communal burial grounds and cemeteries, penal colonies and penal farms actually worked by the inmates, government and private research and quarantine centers and all lands with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already developed, shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act."
Admittedly, there is no express repeal of R.A. No. 3844 as a whole.  Its provisions that are not inconsistent with R.A. No. 6657 may still be given suppletory effect.  Nonetheless, there is now irreconcilable inconsistency or repugnancy between the two laws as regards the treatment of fishponds and prawn farms.  Such repugnancy leads to the conclusion that the provisions of R.A. No. 6657 supersede the provisions of R.A. No. 3844 insofar as fishponds and prawn farms are concerned.  In any event, Section 76 of R.A. No. 6657, as amended, provides that all other laws, decrees, issuances, or parts thereof inconsistent thereto are repealed or amended accordingly.
[27]
Verily, the DARAB finding of agricultural leasehold tenancy relations between petitioner's civil law lessee David Jimenez and respondents have no basis in law.  The rule is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that for tenancy relations to exist, the following requisites must concur: (a) the parties are the landholder and the tenant; (b) the subject is agricultural land; (c) there is consent; (d) the purpose is agricultural production; and (e) there is consideration.
[28]
The absence of one element makes an occupant of a parcel of land, or a cultivator thereof, or a planter thereon outside the scope of the CARL.  Nor can such occupant, cultivator or planter be classified as a 
de jure
 agricultural tenant for purposes of agrarian reform law. And unless a person has established his status as a 
de jure
 tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure nor is he covered by the Land Reform Program of the Government under existing agrarian reform laws.
[29]
In the case under review, the subject fishpond is not an agricultural land subject to compulsory CARP coverage.  Neither was there a sharing of the harvests between petitioner and respondents.  That respondents shared the harvests of the fishpond only with the civil law lessee David Jimenez is uncontroverted.  Evidently, there is no agrarian tenancy relationship between petitioner and respondents.
This is not a case of first impression.  The Court has had occasion to affirm the exemption of fishponds from the coverage of the CARP in 
Atlas Fertilizer Corp. v. Secretary, Department of Agrarian Reform
[30]
 and in 
Romero v. Tan
.
[31]
  In 
Romero
, the Court scored the PARAD for taking cognizance of a complaint for maintenance of peaceful possession over a fishpond filed by a tenant-lessee.  The Court held then:
On the jurisdictional issue, we find that it was reversible error for the PARAB to have taken cognizance of petitioners' complaint. The jurisdiction of the PARAB in this case is limited to agrarian disputes or controversies and other matters or incidents involving the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under Rep. Act No. 6657, Rep. Act No. 3844 and other agrarian laws.  An agrarian dispute is defined as any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farm workers associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.
Although Section 166(1) of Rep. Act No. 3844 had included fishponds in its definition of agricultural land within its coverage, this definition must be considered modified in the light of Sec. 2 of Rep. Act No. 7881, which amended Section 10 of Rep. Act No. 6657; otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL).  Expressly, the amendment has excluded private lands actually, directly and exclusively used for prawn farms and fishponds from the coverage of the CARL.  In fact, under Section 3(c) of R.A. No. 6657, as amended, defines an agricultural land as that which is devoted to agricultural activity and not otherwise classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land.  In turn, Section 3(b) thereof defines agricultural activity as the cultivation of the soil, planting of crops, growing of fruit trees, including the harvesting of such farm products, and other farm activities, and practices performed by a farmer in conjunction with such farming operations done by persons whether natural or juridical.  Clearly, by virtue of the amendments to the CARL, the operation of a fishpond is no longer considered an agricultural activity, and a parcel of land devoted to fishpond operation is not agricultural land as therein defined.
[32]
It may well be argued that respondents have acquired a vested right to security of tenure arising from the alleged existing tenancy relations.  The complaint before the PARAD was filed on April 14, 1994, way before the passage and effectivity of R.A. No. 7881 on February 20, 1995.  However, a claim to any vested right has no leg to stand on.  Section 2(b) of R.A. No. 7881
[33]
 now contains a proviso, precisely to protect vested rights of those who have already been issued a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA).  Without such CLOA, no vested right can accrue to persons claiming it.  Here, the record is bereft of any proof that respondents were issued individual certificates to evidence the award of the property in their favor.
Even assuming, 
ex gratia argumenti
, that the PARAD, DARAB and the CA had jurisdiction, the complaint for maintenance of peaceful possession lodged by respondents still fails for triple reasons.
First
.  Intent is material in tenancy relations.
The DARAB and the CA anchored its finding of tenancy relations on the legal possession of David Jimenez, the civil law lessee, over the subject property.  According to them, as the legal possessor, Jimenez's installation of respondents as tenants binds petitioner.
The rule is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that tenancy is not a purely factual relationship, it is also a legal relationship.
[34]
  The intent of the parties, the understanding when the tenant is installed, their written agreements, provided they are not contrary to law, are crucial.
In 
Valencia v. Court of Appeals
,
[35]
 the Court voided the CA finding of tenancy relations between the landowner and the tenants of the civil law lessee for lack of intent.  The Court held in Valencia:
The substantive issue to be resolved may be expressed in this manner: Can a contract of civil law lease prohibit a civil law lessee from employing a tenant on the land subject matter of the lease agreement?  Otherwise stated, can petitioner's civil law lessee, Fr. Flores, install tenants on the subject premises without express authority to do so under Art. 1649 of the Civil Code, more so when the lessee is expressly prohibited from doing so, as in the instant case?
Contrary to the impression of private respondents, Sec. 6 of R.A. No. 3844, as amended, does not automatically authorize a civil law lessee to employ a tenant without the consent of the landowner.  The lessee must be so specifically authorized.  For the right to hire a tenant is basically a 
personal right of a landowner
, except as may be provided by law.  
But certainly nowhere in Sec. 6 does it say that a civil law lessee of a landholding is automatically authorized to install a tenant thereon
. A different interpretation would create a perverse and absurd situation where a person who wants to be a tenant, and taking advantage of this perceived ambiguity in the law, asks a third person to become a civil law lessee of the landowner.  Incredibly, this tenant would technically have a better right over the property than the landowner himself.  This tenant would then gain security of tenure, and eventually become owner of the land by operation of law.  This is most unfair to the hapless and unsuspecting landowner who entered into a civil law lease agreement in good faith only to realize later on that he can no longer regain possession of his property due to the installation of a tenant by the civil law lessee.
On the other hand, under the express provision of Art. 1649 of the Civil Code, the lessee cannot assign the lease without the consent of the lessor, 
unless there is a stipulation to the contrary
.  In the case before us, not only is there no stipulation to the contrary; the lessee is expressly prohibited from subleasing or encumbering the land, which includes installing a leasehold tenant thereon since the right to do so is an attribute of ownership.  Plainly stated therefore, a contract of civil law lease can prohibit a civil law lessee from employing a tenant on the land subject matter of the lease agreement.  x x x
[36]
Here, petitioner never intended to install respondents as tenants.  As in 
Valencia
, the contract of lease petitioner executed with David Jimenez expressly prohibits the lessees to "sublet the property, nor allow any person, firm or corporation to occupy the same in whole or in part, nor shall the lessee assign in whole or in part any of their right under this contract."
[37]
  It is elementary that possession can be limited by express agreement of the parties.
[38]
  In the case before Us, the lessees were expressly prohibited from subleasing or encumbering the land in any manner.  Of course, this includes the installation of tenants on the subject property.
The Court notes that in 
Joya
 v. Pareja
[39]
 and again in 
Ponce v. Guevarra
,
[40]
 agricultural leasehold tenancy relations were affirmed despite a similar prohibition in the lease agreement.  However, in the said cases, the landowners were deemed to have consented to, and ratified the, installation of the tenants.  The landowners there extended the terms of the lease and negotiated for better terms with the tenants themselves.  They were thus held in estoppel and the tenants considered 
de jure
 occupants.
In the case under review, the record is bereft of any indication that petitioner dealt with respondents in the same manner.  As adverted to earlier, petitioners were consistent that they contracted only with their civil law lessees.  They were not privy to the transactions entered into by its lessee with respondents.
Second
. A stream cannot rise higher than its source.  The civil law lessee, David Jimenez, was not authorized to enter into a tenancy relationship with respondents.
The DARAB and the CA ruled that Section 6 of R.A. No. 3844 authorizes a legal possessor, such as David Jimenez, to employ a tenant even without the consent of the landowner.
Again, they are mistaken.  The Court, in 
Valencia
, traced the origin and outlined the rationale of the polemical provision.  Said the Court:
When Sec. 6 provides that the agricultural leasehold relations shall be limited to the person who furnishes the landholding, either as owner, civil law lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor, and the person who personally cultivates the same, 
it assumes that there is already an existing agricultural leasehold relation, i.e., a tenant or agricultural lessee already works the land
.  The epigraph of Sec. 6 merely states who are "
Parties to Agricultural Leasehold Relations
," which assumes that there is already a leasehold tenant on the land; not until then.  This is precisely what we are still asked to determine in the instant proceedings.
To better understand Sec.6, let us refer to its precursor, Sec. 8 of R.A. No. 1199, as amended.  Again, Sec. 8 of R.A. No. 1199 assumes the existence of a tenancy relation.  As its epigraph suggests, it is a "
Limitation of Relation
," and the purpose is merely to limit the tenancy "to the person who furnishes the land, either as owner, lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor, and to the person who actually works the land himself with the aid of labor available from within his immediate farm household."  Once the tenancy relation is established, the parties to that relation are limited to the persons therein stated.  Obviously, inherent in the right of landholders to install a tenant is their 
authority
 to do so; otherwise, 
without such authority, civil law lessees as landholders cannot install a tenant on the landholding.  Neither Sec. 6 of R.A. No. 3844 nor Sec. 8 of R.A. No. 1199 automatically authorizes the persons named therein to employ a tenant on the landholding
.
According to Mr. Justice Guillermo S. Santos and CAR Executive Judge Artemio C. Macalino, respected authorities on agrarian reform, the reason for Sec. 6 of R.A. No. 3844 and Sec. 8 of R.A No. 1199 in limiting the relationship to the lessee and the lessor is to "discourage absenteeism on the part of the lessor and the custom of co-tenancy" under which "the tenant (lessee) employs another to do the farm work for him, although it is he with whom the landholder (lessor) deals directly.  Thus, under this practice, the one who actually works the land gets the short end of the bargain, for the nominal or `capitalist' lessee hugs for himself a major portion of the harvest."  This breeds exploitation, discontent and confusion x x x.  The 
kasugpong
, kasapi,
 or 
katulong
 also works at the pleasure of the nominal tenant.  When the new law, therefore, limited tenancy relation to the landholder and the person who actually works the land himself with the aid of labor available from within his immediate farm household, it eliminated the nominal tenant or middleman from the picture.
Another noted authority on land return, Dean Jeremias U. Montemayor, explains the rationale for Sec. 8 of R.A. No. 1199, the precursor of Sec. 6 of R.A. No. 3844:
Since the law establishes a special relationship in tenancy with important consequences, it properly pinpoints the persons to whom said relationship shall apply.  The spirit of the law is to prevent both landholder absenteeism and tenant absenteeism. Thus, it would seem that the discretionary powers and important duties of the landholder, like the choice of crop or seed, cannot be left to the will or capacity of an agent or overseer, just as the cultivation of the land cannot be entrusted by the tenant to some other people.  
Tenancy relationship has been held to be of a personal character
.
Section 6 as already stated simply enumerates who are the parties to an existing contract of agricultural tenancy, which presupposes that a tenancy already exists.  It does not state that those who furnish the landholding, i.e., either as owner, civil law lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor, are automatically authorized to employ a tenant on the landholding.  The reason is obvious.  The civil lease agreement may be restrictive.  Even the owner himself may not be free to install a tenant, as when his ownership or possession is encumbered or is subject to a lien or condition that he should not employ a tenant thereon.  This contemplates a situation where the property may be intended for some other specific purpose allowed by law, such as, its conversion into an industrial estate or a residential subdivision.
x x x x
From the foregoing discussion, it is reasonable to conclude that a civil law lessee 
cannot automatically institute
 tenants on the property under Sec. 6 of R.A. No. 3844.  The correct view that must necessarily be adopted is that the civil law lessee, although a legal possessor, may not install tenants on the property unless expressly authorized by the lessor. And if a prohibition exists or is stipulated in the contract of lease the occupants of the property are merely civil law sublessees whose rights terminate upon the expiration of the civil law lease agreement.
[41]
Evidently, securing the consent of the landowner is a condition 
sine qua non
 for the installation of tenants.  Here, petitioner's consent was not obtained prior to the engagement of respondents by the civil law lessee, David Jimenez. Worse, the lease agreement expressly prohibited the assignment of the lease to third persons.  Verily, respondents can acquire no better right than their predecessor-in-interest, David Jimenez.
Third
. The compulsory acquisition of petitioner's landholding pursuant to the agrarian reform program was held in abeyance pending evaluation by its application for exemption.
The records unveil that on September 26, 1989, petitioner applied for exemption from the coverage of the agrarian reform program.
[42]
 On November 10, 1989, the DAR, speaking through Justice Milagros A. German, Senior Special Consultant and Adviser in Legal Affairs,
[43]
 acted favorably on petitioner's application for exemption.  Along this line, the MARO of Masinloc, Zambales, was advised to observe the status 
quo 
and defer the inclusion of petitioner's fishpond in the compulsory acquisition program.
In sum, respondents' claim of security of tenure founded on their installation as tenants of petitioner's civil law lessee is without basis in law.  Procedurally, fishponds and prawn farms were expressly exempted from the coverage of the agrarian reform program.  Substantially, the civil law lessee was not authorized to enter into leasehold-tenancy relations.
WHEREFORE,
 the appealed Decision is 
REVERSED 
AND
 SET ASIDE
. A new one is entered 
DISMISSING
 the complaint for maintenance of peaceful possession and inclusion for compulsory CARP coverage of petitioner's landholding for lack of jurisdiction and lack of merit.
