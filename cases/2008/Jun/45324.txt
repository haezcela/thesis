MAGDALENA P. CATUNGAL COMPLAINANT, V.S. JOCELYN C. FERNANDEZ, COURT STENOGRAPHER I, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, CABA, LA UNION, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO, J.:


This is a complaint for failure to pay a just debt filed by Magdalena P. Catungal (Catungal) against Jocelyn C. Fernandez (Fernandez), Court Stenographer I, Municipal Trial Court, Caba, La Union.
On 14 March 2003, Fernandez bought four cavans of rice worth P4,800 from Catungal.  Fernandez signed a note
[1]
 acknowledging her receipt of the rice and promised to pay the P4,800 on 15 March 2003.
Fernandez failed to pay on 15 March 2003. Catungal repeatedly demanded payment from Fernandez.  Despite the repeated demands, Fernandez refused to pay.  Fernandez kept on promising Catungal that she would pay her debt; however, she never did.  Every time Catungal demanded payment, Fernandez made up an excuse why she could not pay: (1) in a letter
[2]
 dated 19 March 2003, she stated that she was in Baguio; (2) in a letter 
[3]
 dated 27 March 2003, she stated that she had not received a certain check and that she was in Baguio; (3) in a letter
[4]
 dated 2 June 2003, she stated that a certain piece of jewelry was in Baguio and that she was on leave; (4) in a letter
[5]
 
dated 5 June 2003, she stated that her child was not able to bring the piece of jewelry from Baguio; (5) in a letter 
[6]
 dated 9 June 2003, she stated that she was going to Baguio to get the piece of jewelry; (6) in a letter
[7] 
dated 23 June 2003, she stated that she would receive money from someone; and (7) in a letter 
[8]
 dated 21 July 2003, she stated that she got sick and that she would borrow money.
In an affidavit-complaint 
[9]
 dated 26 February 2004 and referred to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), Catungal charged Fernandez with willful failure to pay a just debt.  In its 1
st
 Indorsement
[10]
 
dated 8 October 2004, the OCA directed Fernandez to comment on the affidavit-complaint.  Fernandez ignored the 1
st
 Indorsement.  In its 1
st
 Tracer dated 18 March 2005, the OCA directed Fernandez to comment on the affidavit-complaint. Fernandez ignored the 1
st
 Tracer.  In a Resolution dated 5 June 2006, the Court required Fernandez to comment on the affidavit-complaint and to show cause why she should not be administratively dealt with for repeatedly refusing to comment. Fernandez ignored the 5 June 2006 Resolution.
In a Resolution dated 19 March 2007, the Court dispensed with Fernandez's comment and referred the matter to the OCA for evaluation, report, and recommendation.
In a Report dated 25 June 2007, the OCA found Fernandez liable for willful failure to pay a just debt. Considering that this is the third time Fernandez willfully failed to pay a just debt and considering her refusal to comment on the affidavit-complaint, the OCA recommended that she be dismissed from the service.  However, since Fernandez was already removed from the service on 13 December 2005 for unsatisfactory performance, the OCA recommended that she be fined P5,000 instead.  In a Resolution dated 22 August 2007, the Court re-docketed the case as a regular administrative matter.
The Court finds Fernandez liable for willful failure to pay a just debt and for insubordination.
Willful failure to pay just debts is administratively punishable.
[11]
  It is unbecoming a court employee and a ground for disciplinary action.
[12]
Just debts refer to claims the existence and justness of which are admitted by the debtor.
[13]
  Fernandez's failure to comment on the affidavit-complaint implies her admission of the existence and justness of Catungal's claim.
[14]
  Also, Fernandez's letter dated 21 July 2003 clearly shows her admission of the existence of the debt and her repeated failure to pay it:
I'm sorry Manang last Saturday 
na
 collapse 
kasi
 ako saka sabi ni
 Aweng, 
wala
 pa raw pera
.  
Kaya
 nag
-absent 
ako
 ngayon para magremedyo ng pambayad ko sa iyo
, 
punta
 ako ng
 Agoo 
para
 umutang ng pambayad ko sa yo sa
 moneyline.  
Bukas
ka na lang punta ate
 last promise 
ko
 na sa yo
.
[15]
Fernandez's letters, her refusal to comment on the affidavit-complaint, and the fact that the debt has remained unpaid since 15 March 2003 conclusively show that Fernandez willfully failed to fulfill her obligation to Catungal.
Section 52(C)(10) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service
[16]
 classifies willful failure to pay just debts as a light offense punishable by a reprimand for the first offense, suspension of one to 30 days for the second offense, and dismissal for the third offense. This is the  
third
 time the Court has found Fernandez guilty of willful failure to pay a just debt.  In 
Marata
 v. Fernandez
,
[17]
 
the Court found her liable for willful failure to pay her debt of P95,000.  In 
Bernal, Jr. v. Fernandez 
,
[18]
 the Court found her liable for willful failure to pay her debt of P20,108.
Aside from failing to pay her debt, Fernandez displayed her indifference by repeatedly refusing to comment on the affidavit-complaint.  In its 1
st
 Indorsement dated 8 October 2004 and 1
st
 Tracer dated 18 March 2005, the OCA directed Fernandez to comment on the affidavit-complaint.  In its Resolution dated 5 June 2006, the Court directed Fernandez to comment on the affidavit-complaint. Fernandez opted to ignore all these directives.  Her disregard of the OCA's and the Court's directives is disrespectful
[19]
 and betrays a recalcitrant streak in character. A resolution of the Court should not be construed as a mere request.  It should be complied with promptly and completely.
[20]
Refusal to comply with the Court's directives constitutes insubordination,
[21] 
which is a defiance of authority.  It is a less grave offense punishable by suspension of one month and one day to six months for the first offense and dismissal for the second offense.  This is the 
third
 time the Court has found Fernandez guilty of insubordination. In 
Marata 
[22]
 and 
Bernal, Jr.
,
[23]
 the Court found her liable for insubordination for refusing to comment on the administrative complaint against her.
In 
Judge Aquino v. Fernandez
,
[24]
 the Court found Fernandez liable for simple neglect of duty for failing to type a draft order.  In all three administrative cases decided against her, the Court sternly warned Fernandez that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.
Indeed, Fernandez is incorrigible and unfit to be a court employee. She should be meted the ultimate penalty of dismissal.  However, because she was already removed from the service on 13 December 2005, the Court can no longer impose such penalty.  In lieu of dismissal, the Court imposes a fine and disqualifies her for reemployment in the judiciary.
WHEREFORE
, the Court finds Jocelyn C. Fernandez, Court Stenographer I, Municipal Trial Court, Caba, La Union, 
GUILTY
 
of 
WILLFUL FAILURE TO PAY A JUST DEBT
 and  
INSUBORDINATION
.  Accordingly, the Court 
FINES
 her P5,000. She is also disqualified for reemployment in the judiciary.
