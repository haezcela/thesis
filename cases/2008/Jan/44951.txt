YNARES-SATIAGO, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari are the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals dated March 2, 2001 in CA-G.R. CV No. 57557, which affirmed 
in toto
 the Order dated October 23, 1997 of the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, Branch 73, and the Resolution
[2]
 dated July 10, 2001 denying the motion for reconsideration.


The facts as culled from the records are as follows:


On April 26, 1993 Julita Oamil, herein respondent, filed a complaint for specific performance with damages
[3]

with the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, praying that Partenio
Rombaua (Partenio) be ordered to execute a final deed of sale over the
parcel of land which was the subject of a prior âAgreement to Sellâ
executed by and between them on May 17, 1990. The property which is
alleged to be covered by the said âAgreement to Sellâ consists of 204.5
square meters of land located at #11 21st St., East Bajac-Bajac,
Olongapo City, and is claimed by respondent Oamil to be Partenioâs
conjugal share in a parcel of commercial land (the subject property)
with an aggregate area of 409 square meters acquired by Partenio and
his deceased first wife Juliana
[4]
 during their marriage.

There are two portions of the subject property in contention: one
consisting of 204.5 square meters facing 21st Street (the 21st St.
portion), and another consisting of 204.5 square meters facing Canda
Street (the Canda St. portion). Petitioners and their father Partenio
are acknowledged co-owners of the subject property to the following
extent: one-half to Partenio as his conjugal share, and one-sixth each
of the remaining half to petitioners and Partenio as the surviving
heirs of Juliana.


For failure to file an answer, Partenio was declared in default, and respondent presented her evidence ex parte.


On December 26, 1993, the trial court promulgated its Decision,
[5]
 the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:


WHEREFORE, viewed from all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:

(1) The defendant is hereby ordered to execute a deed of absolute sale
over the Â½ portion (front) of the realty subject matter of this case in
favor of the plaintiff and to surrender the possession thereof to the
plaintiff. Failure of the defendant to do so, then the City Assessor of
Olongapo is hereby directed to effect the transfer of all
rights/interest on the one-half (1/2) front portion of the said realty
in the name of the plaintiff, upon the finality of this decision;

(2) Plaintiff, however, is ordered to pay the amount of EIGHT THOUSAND
PESOS (P8,000.00) representing the balance of the interests due on the
amount of P200,000.00, delinquent for one (1) year computed at 12% per
annum;

(3) Defendant is, likewise, hereby ordered to pay the plaintiff
attorneyâs fees in the amount of TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00).


Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the City Assessor of Olongapo City.


SO ORDERED.
[6]


Note that the trial court did not specify which portion of the property â the 21
st
 St. portion or the Canda St. portion â should be deeded to respondent as buyer of Partenioâs conjugal share.

Partenio failed to appeal, and the decision became final and executory
on February 4, 1994. Entry of judgment was made on February 8, 1994,
and a writ of execution was issued on February 15, 1994 and served upon
Partenio on February 21, 1994. The writ was served as well upon the
City Assessor of Olongapo City, who caused the transfer of the Tax
Declaration covering the 21st St. portion in respondentâs name.

In June 1994, petitioners filed a verified petition for relief from the
decision of the trial court, grounded on the following: 1) that
Partenioâs conjugal share in the property, and that of petitioners as
well, are being litigated in a judicial partition proceeding
[7]

(the partition case) which is pending with the Court of Appeals, hence
the trial court may not yet render a decision disposing of a definite
area of the subject property in respondentâs favor; and, (2) that
petitioners were unjustly deprived of the opportunity to protect and
defend their interest in court because, notwithstanding that they are
indispensable parties to the case (being co-owners of the subject
property), they were not impleaded in Civil Case No. 140-0-93.

In lieu of a hearing, the parties were directed to submit their
respective position papers. Respondent, meanwhile, moved to dismiss the
petition, claiming that the stated grounds for relief are not included
in the enumeration under Section 2, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.
Petitioners opposed the motion.

In an Order dated January 13, 1995, the trial court denied the petition
for relief because the decision in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 had become
final and executory. It held that only indispensable parties to the
case may participate in the proceedings thereof, and since petitioners
may not be considered as indispensable parties because the subject
matter of the proceedings involves Partenioâs conjugal share in the
property, they are precluded from filing a petition for relief from the
courtâs judgment.

Petitioners moved for reconsideration insisting that they are
indispensable parties in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 because as co-owners
of the subject property by virtue of succession to the rights of their
deceased mother, they possess an interest that must be protected.
Instead of resolving the motion, the trial court, with the concurrence
of the petitioners and the respondent, deferred the proceedings, to
await the result of a pending appeal with the Court of Appeals of the
decision in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86,
[8]

the partition case, where the trial court, in its decision, awarded
specifically the Canda St. portion to Partenio as his conjugal share.

In the meantime, or sometime in 1995, a Motion for leave of court to
file a Complaint in Intervention was filed by Sotero Gan (Gan), who
claims to be the actual and rightful owner of Partenioâs conjugal
share. Gan claims to have purchased Partenioâs conjugal share in the
property, and in return, the latter on November 29, 1990 executed a
deed of waiver and quitclaim of his possessory rights. Gan likewise
claims that the tax declaration covering the portion of the property
had been transferred in his name. He thus seeks the dismissal of Civil
Case No. 140-0-93 and the reinstatement of his name on the tax
declaration which by then had been placed in respondentâs name.

The parties submitted their respective oppositions to Ganâs motion, the
core of their argument being that with the finality of the decision in
the case, intervention was no longer proper, and that Ganâs cause of
action, if any, should be litigated in a separate proceeding.

The trial court, in an Order dated January 22, 1996, denied Ganâs
motion for intervention for being filed out of time, considering that
the decision of the court had become final and executory in February
1994. Gan moved for reconsideration which was opposed by respondent,
citing, among others, an Order dated April 18, 1994 issued by the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (CENRO of Olongapo)
which includes a finding that Gan had transferred his rights and
interest in the subject property to one Chua Young Bing.


In another Order dated October 23, 1997,
[9]

the trial court denied Ganâs motion for reconsideration, as well as the
petitionersâ motion for reconsideration of the January 13, 1995 order
denying the petition for relief. In said order, the court made
reference to the decision in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86, which
by then had become final and executory.
[10]

The trial court likewise substantially modified its Decision dated
December 26, 1993, by awarding specifically the 21st St. portion of the
property to Partenio as his conjugal share, despite the pronouncement
in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86 which awards the Canda St. portion
to him.

From the foregoing October 23, 1997 order, the petitioners and Gan
interposed their separate appeals to the Court of Appeals. Meanwhile,
respondent filed a motion for execution pending appeal, which was
denied on the ground that there exist no special or compelling reasons
to allow it.


On March 2, 2001, the appellate court rendered the herein assailed Decision, which affirmed 
in toto 
the appealed October 23, 1997 Order of the trial court.


The appellate court sustained the trial courtâs ruling that Partenioâs conjugal share in the subject property consists of the 21
st

St. portion, thereby disregarding the prior final and executory
decision in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86 which declares that
Partenio is entitled to the Canda St. portion. The appellate court
based the award of the 21
st
 St. portion to respondent on the
ground that petitioners have always acknowledged their father
Partenioâs âacts of ownershipâ over the 21st St. portion, thus
signifying their consent and thereby barring them from questioning the
award.


Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied.


Petitioners are now before us 
via

the present petition, raising the sole issue of whether petitioners can
intervene in the proceedings in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 in order to
protect their rights as co-owners of the subject property.


We resolve to GRANT the petition.

Under a co-ownership, the ownership of an undivided thing or right
belongs to different persons. During the existence of the co-ownership,
no individual can claim title to any definite portion of the community
property until the partition thereof; and prior to the partition, all
that the co-owner has is an ideal or abstract quota or proportionate
share in the entire land or thing.
[11]

Before partition in a co-ownership, every co-owner has the absolute
ownership of his undivided interest in the common property. The
co-owner is free to alienate, assign or mortgage this undivided
interest, except as to purely personal rights. The effect of any such
transfer is limited to the portion which may be awarded to him upon the
partition of the property.
[12]

Under Article 497 of the Civil Code, in the event of a division or
partition of property owned in common, assignees of one or more of the
co-owners may take part in the division of the thing owned in common
and object to its being effected without their concurrence. But they
cannot impugn any partition already executed, unless there has been
fraud, or in case it was made notwithstanding a formal opposition
presented to prevent it, without prejudice to the right of the debtor
or assignor to maintain its validity.

The decision in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86, which is an action
for judicial partition of the subject property, determines what
Partenio, and ultimately, respondent, as his successor-in-interest, is
entitled to in Civil Case No. 140-0-93. As Partenioâs
successor-in-interest to the property, respondent could not acquire any
superior right in the property than what Partenio is entitled to or
could transfer or alienate after partition. In a contract of sale of
co-owned property, what the vendee obtains by virtue of such a sale are
the same rights as the vendor had as co-owner, and the vendee merely
steps into the shoes of the vendor as co-owner.
[13]

As early as May 17, 1990, when respondent and Partenio executed the
âAgreement to Sellâ, the former knew that the property she was
purchasing was conjugal property owned in common by Partenio and the
heirs of his deceased wife.
[14]

And while Civil Case No. 140-0-93 (the specific performance case) was
pending, respondent was apprised of the pendency of Special Civil
Action No. 340-0-86 (the partition case). Yet, respondent did not
intervene, nor did she take part, nor enter any formal opposition â as
assignee of Partenioâs conjugal share in the property â in said
partition proceedings. She did not exercise the rights granted her
under Article 497 of the Civil Code. Instead, when the court in Civil
Case No. 140-0-93 decided to suspend the proceedings and hold the same
in abeyance while the appeal in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86
remained unresolved, the respondent unconditionally agreed to its
temporary abatement. In other words, she chose to sit back and await
the resolution thereof.

Consequently, when the decision in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86
became final and executory without the respondent having questioned the
same in any manner whatsoever, by appeal or otherwise, the division of
property decreed therein may no longer be impugned by her.


Thus said, the trial court in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 could not award the 21
st

St. portion to Partenio, since the court in Special Civil Action No.
340-0-86 specifically awarded the Canda St. portion to him. The
decision in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86, which became final and
executory, should put an end to the co-ownership between Partenio and
the respondents, and the award made to each co-owner of specific
portions of the property as their share in the co-ownership should be
respected.

Since the issue of each of the co-ownersâ specific portion in the
aggregate property has been laid to rest in Special Civil Action No.
340-0-86, the final and executory decision in said proceeding should be
conclusive on the issue of which specific portion of the property
became the subject matter of the sale between Partenio and the
respondent; that is, that Partenio, as declared owner of the Canda St.
portion, could have transferred to respondent only that part of the
property and not the 21st St. portion. Although Partenio was free to
sell or transfer his undivided interest to the respondent, the effect
of such transfer is limited to the portion which may be awarded to him
upon the partition of the property.


It was likewise error for the appellate court to have considered the alleged acts of ownership exercised upon the 21
st

St. portion by Partenio as weighing heavily against the decreed
partition in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86. The determination of
this issue is beyond the ambit of the trial court in Civil Case No.
140-0-93. As far as it was concerned, it could only award to the
respondent, if proper, whatever specific portion Partenio is found to
be entitled to in the event of a partition, in accordance with Article
493 of the Civil Code and the procedure outlined in the Rules of Court.
It could not, in an ordinary proceeding for specific performance with
damages, subject the property to a partial division or partition
without the knowledge and participation of the other co-owners, and
while a special civil action for partition was simultaneously pending
in another court.

The court in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 is not a partition court but one
litigating an ordinary civil case, and all evidence of alleged acts of
ownership by one co-owner should have been presented in the partition
case, there to be threshed out in order that the partition court may
arrive at a just division of the property owned in common; it is not
for the trial court in the specific performance case to properly
appreciate. Being a court trying an ordinary civil suit, the court in
Civil Case No. 140-0-93 had no jurisdiction to act as a partition
court. Trial courts trying an ordinary action cannot resolve to perform
acts pertaining to a special proceeding because it is subject to
specific prescribed rules.
[15]

That the trial court suspended the proceedings in Civil Case No.
140-0-93 to make way for the resolution of Special Civil Action No.
340-0-86 was an indication that it intended to abide by whatever would
be decreed in the latter case. For, understandably, the resolution of
Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86 will settle the issue in Civil Case
No. 140-0-93 with respect to which specific portion of the property
constitutes the subject matter of the specific performance suit and
which would, in any case, be adjudicated to either of the two â the
defendant co-owner and seller Partenio or the plaintiff buyer Oamil,
the herein respondent. Yet in the end, the trial court ultimately
disregarded what had been finally adjudicated and settled in Special
Civil Action No. 340-0-86, and instead it took a position that was
entirely diametrically opposed to it.

It was likewise irregular for the respondent to have obtained a
certificate of title over specific property which has not been
partitioned, especially where she concedes awareness of the existing
co-ownership which has not been terminated, and recognizes her status
as mere successor-in-interest to Partenio. The spring may not rise
higher than its source.

In sum, the trial court and the Court of Appeals, by disregarding the
final and executory judgment in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86,
certainly ignored the principle of conclusiveness of judgments, which
states that â

[A]
 fact or
question which was in issue in a former suit and was there judicially
passed upon and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, is
conclusively settled by the judgment therein as far as the parties to
that action and persons in privity with them are concerned and cannot
be again litigated in any future action between such parties or their
privies, in the same court or any other court of concurrent
jurisdiction on either the same or different cause of action, while the
judgment remains unreversed by proper authority. It has been held that
in order that a judgment in one action can be conclusive as to a
particular matter in another action between the same parties or their
privies, it is essential that the issue be identical. If a particular
point or question is in issue in the second action, and the judgment
will depend on the determination of that particular point or question,
a former judgment between the same parties or their privies will be
final and conclusive in the second if that same point or question was
in issue and adjudicated in the first suit (Nabus vs. Court of Appeals,
193 SCRA 732 
[1991]
). Identity of cause of action is not required but merely identity of issues.
[16]

The ruling in Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86 â that the Canda St.
portion shall go to Partenio â became the law of the case and continues
to be binding between the parties as well as their
successors-in-interest, the decision in said case having become final
and executory. Hence, the binding effect and enforceability of that
dictum can no longer be relitigated anew in Civil Case No. 140-0-93
since said issue had been resolved and finally laid to rest in the
partition case, by conclusiveness of judgment, if not by the principle
of 
res judicata.
 It may not be reversed, modified or altered in any manner by any court.

As a result of the trial courtâs refusal to abide by the decision in
Special Civil Action No. 340-0-86, the rights of the petitioners have
been unnecessarily transgressed, thereby giving them the right to seek
relief in court in order to annul the October 23, 1997 Order of the
trial court which substantially and wrongly modified its original
decision in Civil Case No. 140-0-93. It was clear mistake for the trial
court to have gone against the final and executory decision in Special
Civil Action No. 340-0-86 and its original decision, which does not
award a definite portion of the disputed property to Partenio,
precisely because, as a court litigating an ordinary civil suit, it is
not authorized to partition the subject property but only to determine
the rights and obligations of the parties in respect to Partenioâs
undivided share in the commonly owned property. As a result of this
mistake, the petitioners are entitled to relief.

Finally, with respect to Ganâs intervention, we affirm the appellate
courtâs finding that the same is no longer proper considering that the
decision in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 had become final and executory. Gan
moved to intervene only in 1995, when the decision became final and
executory in February 1994. Certainly, intervention, being merely
collateral or ancillary to the principal action, may no longer be
allowed in a case already terminated by final judgment.
[17]

Moreover, since Gan did not appeal the herein assailed decision of the
appellate court, then the same, as against him, has become final and
executory.


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
GRANTED.
 The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 2, 2001 in CA-G.R. CV No. 57557 and the Resolution dated July 10, 2001 are 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE,
 with the exception that the denial of the intervenor Sotero Ganâs motion for intervention is 
AFFIRMED.


The Order dated October 23, 1997 of the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 is hereby 
DECLARED
 of no effect. In all other respects, the Decision of the trial court in Civil Case No. 140-0-93 dated December 26, 1993 is 
AFFIRMED.
 The said court is moreover

 Special Civil Action No.
340-0-86 for judicial partition, entitled âPaquito Rombaua, et al. vs.
Partenio Rombauaâ was filed in the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo
City, Branch 75.

The decision dated July 31, 1990 (Rollo, pp. 49-56) in said case annuls
the deed of extrajudicial partition and settlement entered into between
the plaintiffs (herein petitioners) and their father Partenio, declares
spouses Partenio and Juliana Rombaua conjugal owners of the subject
property (the whole 409 square meters at No. 11 21st Street, East
Bajac-Bajac, Olongapo City), and orders the partition thereof between
the plaintiff heirs and their surviving father Partenio in the
following manner:


 One half of the lot pertains to defendant Partenio
Rombaua as his share in the conjugal assets or a portion with an area
of 204.5 square meters;

 One half of the lot with an area of 204.5 square meters to be owned 
pro indiviso

by the defendant Partenio Rombaua and the plaintiffs Paquito Rombaua,
Leonor R. Opiana, Ruperto Rombaua, Julita R. Panganiban and Teresita R.
Terlaje at 1/6 share each;

 
To physically divide the lot in accordance with the
sketch Exhibit E prepared by the parties, in such a manner that the
conjugal share of the defendant Partenio Rombaua will be that portion
presently occupied by him and where the carinderia is erected, with
CANDA ST. as the frontage;


 The one storey building with a floor area of 101 square meters and as described in the complaint to be divided, 
pro indiviso,
 in the proportion as indicated above; and


 The income on the building by way of rentals to be divided likewise in such proportion as indicated above. (Emphasis supplied)
