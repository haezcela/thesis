PUNO, CJ.:


These cases involve the issue of whether the Ombudsman may directly discipline public school teachers and employees, or merely 
recommend
 appropriate disciplinary action to the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS).
In 
G.R.  Nos.  165416 and 165731
, respondent Florita A.  Masing was the former Principal of the Davao City Integrated Special School (DCISS) in Bangkal, Davao City.  Respondent Jocelyn A.  Tayactac was an office clerk in the same school.  In 1997, respondents were administratively charged before the Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao for allegedly collecting unauthorized fees, failing to remit authorized fees, and to account for public funds.  The cases were docketed as follows:
OMB-MIN-ADM-97-193 for grave misconduct and neglect of duty, against respondent Masing only;
OMB-MIN-ADM-97-249 for violation of Republic Act No.  6713, against respondent Masing and a schoolteacher;
OMB-MIN-ADM-97-253 for violation of Republic Act No.  6713, against respondents Masing and Tayactac, and several schoolteachers;
OMB-MIN-ADM-97-254 for violation of Republic Act No.  6713, against respondent Masing and several schoolteachers.
The complainants were parents of children studying at the DCISS, among whom were the petitioners in 
G.R.  No.  165731
, namely, Paul L.  Cansino, Felicidad Mojica, Venerando Mojica, and Ricarte L.  Mamparo.
On July 2, 1998, respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction over them.  Respondents alleged that the DECS has jurisdiction over them which shall exercise the same through a committee to be constituted under Section 9 of Republic Act (R.A.) No.  4670, otherwise known as the âThe Magna Carta for Public School Teachers.â The motion was denied, as well as respondentsâ motion for reconsideration.
On June 30, 2000, the Ombudsman for Mindanao rendered a joint decision finding respondents Masing and Tayactac guilty, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Office finds substantial evidence that:
Respondent Florita Masing is guilty of gross misconduct, neglect of duty and violation of Section 4, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of RA 6713 in relation to the collection of unauthorized fees, non-remittance of authorized fees and failure to account for public funds; and of misconduct in relation to the complaint of Felicidad Mojica, and she is hereby DISMISSED FROM [THE] SERVICE with all the accessory penalties including forfeiture of retirement benefits and disqualification from holding public office; and
Respondent Jocelyn Tayactac is guilty of simple neglect of duty, and is hereby suspended for a period of six (6) months.  A repetition of the same offense will be met with stiffer penalty.  x x x x
[1]
Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration which the Ombudsman denied in an Order dated September 26, 2000.  Respondents sought recourse to the Court of Appeals via a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, docketed as CA-G.R.  SP No.  61993.  On February 27, 2004, the Court of Appeals granted the petition, 
viz
:
WHEREFORE
, the joint decision of June 30, 2000 and the Order of September 26, 2000 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
; and Administrative Cases Nos.  OMB-MIN-ADM-97-193, OMB-MIN-ADM-97-249, OMB-MIN-ADM-97-253, and OMB-MIN-ADM-97-254 of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao are hereby 
DISMISSED
.
The 
IMMEDIATE REINSTATEMENT
 of the petitioners with full backwages and other benefits is further 
ORDERED
 in the interest of justice.
[2]
On April 13, 2004, the Office of the Ombudsman, which was not impleaded as respondent in the cases, filed an 
Omnibus Motion to Intervene and for Reconsideration.
[3]
 The Court of Appeals denied the omnibus motion on the grounds that (1) intervention is not proper because it is sought by the quasi-judicial body whose judgment is on appeal, and (2) intervention, even if permissible, is belated under Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court.
[4]
 Hence, the petition before us by the Office of the Ombudsman, docketed as 
G.R.  No.  165416.
The complainant-parents filed their own petition for review of the Court of Appealsâ decision dated February 27, 2004, docketed as G.R.  No.  165731.
In 
G.R.  No.  165584
, respondent Florita A.  Masing faced yet another administrative case before the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao filed by Erlinda P.  Tan.
[5]
 The charges were oppression, serious misconduct, discourtesy in the conduct of official duties, and physical or mental incapacity or disability due to immoral or vicious habits.
As in the other administrative cases, respondent Masing filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Office of the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction over the case.  The motion was denied, as well as respondentâs motion for reconsideration.
On December 27, 1999, the Ombudsman for Mindanao found respondent Masing guilty as charged and ordered her suspension for six (6) months without pay.  The DECS Regional Director, Regional Office No.  XI, was ordered to implement the decision upon its finality.
Respondent Masing filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R.  SP No.  58735.  On July 31, 2003, the Court of Appeals set aside the assailed Ombudsman decision, 
viz
:
WHEREFORE
, finding merit in the herein petition, the same is hereby given due course and the decision of the agency 
a quo
 in Case No.  OMB-MIN-ADM-97-282 is hereby 
SET ASIDE
, and petitioner is further declared as entitled to her salary which she failed to receive during the period of her flawed suspension.
[6]
The Office of the Ombudsman filed an 
Omnibus Motion to Intervene and for Reconsideration
 which the Court of Appeals denied in its Resolution dated September 30, 2004.
[7]
 Hence, this petition by the Office of the Ombudsman, docketed as 
G.R.  No.  165584
.
We consolidated G.R.  Nos.  165416 and 165584 in our Resolution dated November 9, 2005.  G.R.  No.  165731 was consolidated per Resolution dated June 21, 2006.
The Office of the Ombudsman contends

TAPIADOR 
FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROPER CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY BASES OF THE OMBUDSMANâS DISCIPLINARY POWER OVER ALL APPOINTIVE AND ELECTIVE PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES.
II.
TO INSIST THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS PURSUANT TO THE RULING IN

III.
SECTION 9 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO.  4670 HAS NOT ADDED PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS TO THE LIST OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGED CLASSES OF PUBLIC SERVANTS EXEMPTED FROM THE OMBUDSMANâS ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY UNDER THE 1987 CONSTITUTION, AND ANY SUCH INTERPRETATION SUFFERS FROM THE VICE OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY.
IV.
THE CONCEDED ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINARY JURISDICTION OF THE OMBUDSMAN OVER THE HEREIN RESPONDENTS, WHICH IS FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE 1987 CONSTITUTION, REPUBLIC ACT NO.  6770 AND EXISTING JURISPRUDENCE CANNOT BE SUPPLANTED BY SECTION 9 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO.  4670.
In sum, the pivotal issues are (1) whether the Office of the Ombudsman may intervene and seek reconsideration of the adverse decisions rendered by the Court of Appeals, and (2) whether the Office of the Ombudsman may directly discipline public school teachers and employees.
First, the procedural issue.  The Office of the Ombudsman was not allowed by the Court of Appeals to intervene because (1) the motions to intervene were filed after the decisions have already been rendered in CA-G.R.  SP Nos.  58735 and 61993, and (2) the Office of the Ombudsman was the quasi-judicial body which rendered the impugned decisions.
Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court provides that a motion for intervention may be filed 
before 
rendition of judgment, viz:
SECTION 2.  
Time to intervene.
â 
The motion to intervene may be filed at any time before rendition of judgment
 by the trial court.  A copy of the pleading-in-intervention shall be attached to the motion and served on the original parties.  (
emphasis ours
)
We have ruled however that allowance or disallowance of a motion for intervention rests on the sound discretion of the court
[12]
 after consideration of the appropriate circumstances.
[13]
 Rule 19 of the 
Rules of Court
 is a rule of procedure whose object is to make the powers of the court fully and completely available for justice.
[14]
 Its purpose is not to hinder or delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice.
[15]
 Thus, interventions have been allowed even beyond the prescribed period in the Rule in the higher interest of justice.  Interventions have been granted to afford indispensable parties, who have not been impleaded, the right to be heard even after a decision has been rendered by the trial court,
[16]
 when the petition for review of the judgment was already submitted for decision before the Supreme Court,
[17]
 and even where the assailed order has already become final and executory.
[18]
 
In Lim v.  Pacquing
,
[19]
 the motion for intervention filed by the Republic of the Philippines was allowed by this Court to avoid grave injustice and injury and to settle once and for all the substantive issues raised by the parties.
In the cases at bar, the rulings of the Court of Appeals adversely affected the all-important jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman.  The rulings aggrieved the Office of the Ombudsman for they have serious consequences on its effectiveness as the body charged by the Constitution with the prosecution of officials and employees of the government suspected of violating our laws on graft and corruption.
In 
Civil Service Commission v.  Dacoycoy,
[20]
 we recognized the standing of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to appeal a decision of the Court of Appeals which reversed its decision finding Dacoycoy guilty of nepotism and ordering his dismissal from the service.  Although the CSC was the quasi-judicial body which rendered the decision appealed to the Court of Appeals, it became the party aggrieved or adversely affected by its decision which âseriously prejudices the civil service system.â
[21]
 In 
Constantino-David v.  Pangandaman-Gania,
[22]
 we likewise ruled that the CSC may seek a review of decisions of the Court of Appeals that are detrimental to its constitutional mandate as the central personnel agency of the government.
[23]
However, rather than remand the cases at bar to the Court of Appeals for a ruling on the merits of the Ombudsmanâs motions for reconsideration, we shall resolve the legal issues involved in the interest of speedy justice.
The authority of the Ombudsman to act on complaints filed against public officers and employees is explicit in Article XI, Section 12 of the 
1987 Constitution
, 
viz
:
The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall 
act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations,
 and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof.  (
emphasis ours
)
Article XI, Section 13 of the same Constitution delineates the powers, functions and duties of the Ombudsman as follows:
1) Investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.
(2) Direct, upon complaint or at its own instance, any public official or employee of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, as well as of any government-owned or controlled corporation with original charter, to perform and expedite any act or duty required by law, or to stop, prevent, and correct any abuse or impropriety in the performance of duties.
(3) Direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action against a public official or employee at fault, and recommend his removal, suspension, demotion, fine, censure, or prosecution, and ensure compliance therewith.
(4) Direct the officer concerned, in any appropriate case, and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, to furnish it with copies of documents relating to contracts and transactions entered into by his office involving the disbursement or use of public funds or properties, to the Commission on Audit for appropriate and report any irregularity action.
(5) Request any government agency for assistance and information necessary in the discharge of its responsibilities, and to examine, if necessary, pertinent records and documents.
(6) Publicize matters covered by its investigation when circumstances so warrant and with due prudence.
(7) Determine the causes of inefficiency, red tape, mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the Government and make recommendations for their elimination and the observance of high standards of ethics and efficiency.
(8) Promulgate its rules and procedure and exercise such other powers or perform such functions or duties as may be provided by law.
The enumeration of these powers is non-exclusive.
[24]
 Congress enacted R.A.  No.  6770,
[25]
 otherwise known as 
The Ombudsman Act of 1989
, on November 17, 1989 giving the Office such other powers that it may need to efficiently perform the task given by the Constitution,
[26]
 
viz
:
Section 15.  
Powers, Functions and Duties.
- The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties:
(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.  It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of the Government, the investigation of such cases;
(2) Direct, upon complaint or at its own instance, any officer or employee of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, as well as any government-owned or controlled corporations with original charter, to perform and expedite any act or duty required by law, or to stop, prevent, and correct any abuse or impropriety in the performance of duties;
(3) Direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action against a public officer or employee at fault or who neglects to perform an act or discharge a duty required by law, and recommend his removal, suspension, demotion, fine, censure, or prosecution, and ensure compliance therewith; or enforce its disciplinary authority as provided in Section 21 of this Act; Provided, That the refusal by any officer without just cause to comply with an order of the Ombudsman to remove, suspend, demote, fine, censure, or prosecute an officer or employee who is at fault or who neglects to perform an act or discharge a duty required by law shall be a ground for disciplinary action against said officer;
(4) Direct the officer concerned, in any appropriate case, and subject to such limitations as it may provide in its rules of procedure, to furnish it with copies of documents relating to contracts or transactions entered into by his office involving the disbursement or use of public funds or properties, and report any irregularity to the Commission on Audit for appropriate action;
(5) Request any government agency for assistance and information necessary in the discharge of its responsibilities, and to examine, if necessary, pertinent records and documents;
(6) Publicize matters covered by is investigation of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) hereof, when circumstances so warrant and with due prudence: 
Provided
, That the Ombudsman under its rules and regulations may determine what cases may not be made public: 
Provided, further
, That any publicity issued by the Ombudsman shall be balanced, fair and true;
(7) Determine the causes of inefficiency, red tape, mismanagement, fraud and corruption in the Government, and make recommendations for their elimination and the observance of high standards of ethics and efficiency;
(8) Administer oaths, issue 
subpoena
 and s
ubpoena duces tecum
, and take testimony in any investigation or inquiry, including the power to examine and have access to bank accounts and records;
(9) Punish for contempt in accordance with the Rules of Court and under the same procedure and with the same penalties provided therein;
(10) Delegate to the Deputies, or its investigators or representatives such authority or duty as shall ensure the effective exercise or performance of the powers, functions, and duties herein or hereinafter provided;
(11) Investigate and initiate the proper action for the recovery of ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth amassed after February 25, 1986 and the prosecution of the parties involved therein.  x x x x
[27]
In fine, the manifest intent of the lawmakers was to bestow on the Office of the Ombudsman 
full
 administrative disciplinary authority in accord with the constitutional deliberations.
[28]
 Unlike the Ombudsman-like agencies of the past the powers of which extend to no more than making findings of fact and recommendations, and the Ombudsman or 
Tanodbayan
 under the 1973 Constitution who may file and prosecute criminal, civil or administrative cases against public officials and employees only in cases of failure of justice, the Ombudsman under the 1987 Constitution and R.A.  No.  6770 is intended to play a more active role in the enforcement of laws on anti-graft and corrupt practices and other offenses committed by public officers and employees.
[29]
 The Ombudsman is to be an âactivist watchman,â not merely a passive one.
[30]
 He is vested with broad powers to enable him to implement his own actions.
[31]
Respondents, however, insist that the findings of the Ombudsman are mere recommendations, and that he may not directly impose administrative sanctions on public officials and employees, citing 
Tapiador v.  Office of the Ombudsman
[32]
 where the following statement is found, 
viz
:
x x x x Besides, assuming 
arguendo
, that petitioner was administratively liable, the Ombudsman has no authority to directly dismiss the petitioner from the government service, more particularly from his position in the BID.  Under Section 13, subparagraph (3), of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman can only ârecommendâ the removal of the public official or employee found to be at fault, to the public official concerned.
The foregoing is now a settled issue.  In 
Ledesma v.  Court of Appeals,
[33]
 we explained 
Tapiador
 and ruled categorically that:
x x x x Under Section 13(3) of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, it is provided:
Section 13.  The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions, and duties:
.  .  .
(3) Direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action against a public official or employee at fault, and 
recommend
 his removal, suspension, demotion, fine, censure, or prosecution, and 
ensure compliance therewith.
 (Emphasis supplied)
Petitioner insists that the word â
recommend
â be given its literal meaning; that is, that the Ombudsmanâs action is only advisory in nature rather than one having any binding effect, citing 
Tapiador v.  Office of the Ombudsman
, thus:
.  .  .  Besides, assuming 
arguendo
, that petitioner were administratively liable, the Ombudsman has no authority to directly dismiss the petitioner from the government service, more particularly from his position in the BID.  Under Section 13, subparagraph (3), of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman can only ârecommendâ the removal of the public official or employee found to be at fault, to the public official concerned.
For their part, the Solicitor General and the Office of the Ombudsman argue that the word â
recommend
â must be taken in conjunction with the phrase 
âand ensure compliance therewith.â
 
The proper interpretation of the Courtâs statement in Tapiador should be that the Ombudsman has the authority to determine the administrative liability of a public official or employee at fault, and direct and compel the head of the office or agency concerned to implement the penalty imposed.  In other words, it merely concerns the 
procedural
 aspect of the Ombudsmanâs functions and not its 
jurisdiction
.
We agree with the ratiocination of public respondents.  Several reasons militate against a literal interpretation of the subject Constitutional provision.  Firstly, a cursory reading of Tapiador reveals that the main point of the case was the failure of the complainant therein to present substantial evidence to prove the charges of the administrative case.  
The statement that made reference to the power of the Ombudsman is, at best, merely an 
obiter dictum
 and, as it is unsupported by sufficient explanation, is susceptible to varying interpretations x x x x [h]ence, it cannot be cited as a doctrinal declaration of this Court nor is it safe from judicial examination.
  (
emphases ours
)
We reiterated this ruling in 
Office of the Ombudsman v.  Laja
,
[34]
 where we emphasized that âthe Ombudsmanâs order to remove, suspend, demote, fine, censure, or prosecute an officer or employee is not merely advisory or recommendatory but is 
actually mandatory
.â
[35]
 Implementation of the order imposing the penalty is, however, to be coursed through the proper officer.
[36]
 Recently, in 
Office of the Ombudsman v.  Court of Appeal
s,
[37]
 we also heldâ
While Section 15(3) of RA 6770 states that the Ombudsman has the power to ârecommend x x x removal, suspension, demotion x x xâ of government officials and employees, the same Section 15(3) also states that the Ombudsman in the alternative may â
enforce its disciplinary authority as provided in Section 21â 
of RA 6770.  (
emphasis supplied
)
Finally, respondent Masing contends that she may be administratively dealt with only by following the procedure prescribed in Section 9 of R.A.  No.  4670 or the 
The Magna Carta for Public School Teachers
.  She cites 
Fabella v.  Court of Appeals
.
[38]
Section 9, R.A.  No.  4670 providesâ
Section 9.  
Administrative Charges.
- Administrative charges against a teacher shall be heard initially by a committee composed of the corresponding School Superintendent of the Division or a duly authorized representative who should at least have the rank of a division supervisor, where the teacher belongs, as chairman, a representative of the local or, in its absence, any existing provincial or national teachersâ organization and a supervisor of the Division, the last two to be designated by the Director of Public Schools.  The Committee shall submit its findings, and recommendations to the Director of Public Schools within thirty days from the termination of the hearings; 
Provided, however
, That where the school superintendent is the complainant or an interested party, all the members of the committee shall be appointed by the Secretary of Education.
In 
Fabella
, several public schoolteachers were administratively charged by then DECS Secretary Isidro CariÃ±o for taking part in mass actions in violation of civil service laws and regulations.  A committee was constituted to hear the charges.  The teachers assailed the procedure adopted by the committee in a petition for 
certiorari
 filed before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.  In affirming the regional trial courtâs decision which declared illegal the constitution of the committee, we ruledâ
x x x x Section 9 of RA 4670 x x x reflects the legislative intent to impose a standard and a separate set of procedural requirements in connection with administrative proceedings involving public schoolteachers.  x x x 
[R]
ight to due process of law requires compliance with these requirements laid down by RA 4670.
[39]
Fabella
, however, does not apply to the cases at bar.  The public schoolteachers in 
Fabella
 were charged with violations of civil service laws, rules and regulations in administrative proceedings initiated by the DECS Secretary.  In contrast, herein respondents Masing and Tayactac were administratively charged in letter-complaints duly filed before the Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao.  The charges were for violations of R.A.  No.  6713, otherwise known as the 
Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees
, collecting unauthorized fees, failure to remit authorized fees, failure to account for public funds, oppression, serious misconduct, discourtesy in the conduct of official duties, and physical or mental incapacity or disability due to immoral or vicious habits.  In short, the acts and omissions complained of relate to respondentsâ conduct as public official and employee, if not to outright graft and corruption.
The authority of the Office of the Ombudsman to conduct administrative investigations is beyond cavil.
[40]
 As the principal and primary complaints and action center
[41]
 against erring public officers and employees, it is mandated by no less than Section 13(1), Article XI of the Constitution.
[42]
 In conjunction therewith, Section 19 of R.A.  No.  6770 grants to the Ombudsman the authority to act on all administrative complaints,
[43]
 
viz
:
Sec.  19.  
Administrative complaints.
â The Ombudsman shall act on all complaints relating, but not limited, to acts or omissions which:
(1) Are contrary to law or regulation;
(2) Are unreasonable, unfair, oppressive or discriminatory;
(3) Are inconsistent with the general course of an agencyâs functions, though in accordance with law;
(4)  Proceed from a mistake of law or an arbitrary ascertainment of facts;
(5) Are in the exercise of discretionary powers but for an improper purpose; or
(6) Are otherwise irregular, immoral or devoid of justification.
Section 23(1) of the same law provides that administrative investigations conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman shall be in accordance with its rules of procedure and consistent with due process.
It is erroneous, therefore, for respondents to contend that R.A.  No.  4670 confers an exclusive disciplinary authority on the DECS over public school teachers and prescribes an exclusive procedure in administrative investigations involving them.
[44]
 R.A.  No.  4670 was approved on June 18, 1966.  On the other hand, the 1987 Constitution was ratified by the people in a plebiscite in 1987 while R.A.  No.  6770 was enacted on November 17, 1989.  It is basic that the 1987 Constitution should not be restricted in its meaning by a law of earlier enactment.  The 1987 Constitution and R.A.  No.  6770 were quite explicit in conferring authority on the Ombudsman to act on complaints against 
all 
public officials and employees, with the exception of officials who may be removed only by impeachment or over members of Congress and the Judiciary.
[45]
 If an issue should ever arise, therefore, it should rather be whether the 1987 Constitution and R.A.  No.  6770 have abrogated R.A.  No.  4670.  However, repeals by implication are not favored, and courts have the duty to harmonize, so far as it is practicable, apparently conflicting or inconsistent provisions.  Therefore, the statement in 
Fabella
 that Section 9 of R.A.  No.  4670 âreflects the legislative intent to impose a standard and a separate set of procedural requirements in connection with administrative proceedings involving public schoolteachersâ should be construed as referring only to the 
specific 
procedure to be followed in administrative investigations conducted by the DECS.
