(b) explain
 in writing, within thirty (30) days from notice, why

civil cases since they were filed/raffled, to wit: Civil Cases Nos.

from the Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC-Cotabato City, and retain

[7]


(d) submit
 a report on her compliance with directives (c) and (d), within 15 days from notice.


Judge Bagundang submitted his Compliance
[8]

in May 2005, attaching copies of the decisions and orders issued by him
in the cases mentioned in OCA Memorandum dated March 24, 2003. However,
he offered no explanation as to why he failed to decide, within the
mandatory period, the cases mentioned in directives (a) and (b). OIC
Silongan failed to comply as of that date.

Consequently, in a Memorandum dated June 1, 2005, the OCA recommended
that Judge Bagundang be fined twenty thousand (P20,000.00) pesos for
gross inefficiency for his failure to decide within the mandatory
period Criminal Case No. 754, and Civil Case Nos. 241, 446, 459 and
MC-750; for his failure to decide within the mandatory period the
pending motion in Civil Case No. 294; and, for his failure to submit
his explanation on his failure to decide or resolve the aforementioned
cases within the prescribed period. The OCA likewise recommended that
OIC Silongan be directed to explain her failure to comply with OCA
Memorandum dated March 24, 2003, and to submit her compliance within
fifteen (15) days from notice with warning that her failure to do so
shall be dealt with more severely.

In our Resolution dated July 11, 2005, we redocketed the OCA report as
a regular administrative matter against Judge Bagundang, and ordered
OIC Silongan to explain her failure to comply with OCA Memorandum dated
March 24, 2003, within fifteen (15) days from notice with warning.

In her Compliance dated August 30, 2005, OIC Silongan explained that
her failure to timely comply with the OCA Memorandum was due to the
following reasons: (1) the number of cases involved is substantial; (2)
she and Eduardo C. Gesulga, Jr., the staff assistant in charge of the
court docket, were the only ones doing the work; (3) Judge Bagundang
gave assignments in connection with his retirement; (4) the new
presiding judge gave her assignments as well; and (5) she has a pending
knee operation which necessitates weekly trips to Davao for medication.
OIC Silongan likewise reported on the status of the cases mentioned in
directives (a) and (b) of OCA Memorandum dated March 24, 2003. She
alleged that she complied with directives (c) and (d) on the date of
the judicial audit. In addition, she submitted a medical certificate
attesting as to her knee ailment.

In a Memorandum dated July 14, 2006, the OCA recommended that OIC
Silongan be fined P1,000.00 for negligence in the performance of her
duties and responsibilities as OIC Clerk of Court, with warning that a
repetition of the same infractions will be dealt with more severely.

We redocketed the OCA report as a regular administrative matter against
OIC Silongan and consolidated the same with A.M. No. RTJ-05-1937 in our
Resolution dated September 13, 2006.


We adopt the recommendations of the OCA.


Section 15(1), Article VIII of the 
1987 Constitution
 provides:


All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this
Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from
date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the
Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and 
three months for all other lower courts.
 (emphasis ours)


In connection therewith, Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the 
Code of Judicial Conduct
 provides:


A judge shall dispose of the courtâs business promptly and decide cases within the required periods.


We have repeatedly ruled that the 90-day period is mandatory.
[9]

Any delay in the administration of justice, no matter how brief,
deprives the litigant of his right to a speedy disposition of his case.
[10]

Not only does it magnify the cost of seeking justice, it likewise
undermines the peopleâs faith and confidence in the judiciary, lowering
its standards and bringing it to disrepute.
[11]

It is only in certain meritorious cases, i.e., those involving
difficult questions of law or complex issues or when the judge is
burdened by heavy caseloads, that a longer period to decide may be
allowed but only upon proper application made with the Supreme Court by
the judge concerned.
[12]

In the case at bar, Judge Bagundang failed to decide five (5) cases and
to resolve a pending motion within the mandatory period, and offered no
explanation for it. Worse, he submitted his compliance with the OCA
directives only two (2) years after they were issued against him.


Failure to decide even a single case within the required period, absent sufficient justification,
[13]
 constitutes gross inefficiency meriting administrative sanction.
[14]
 A member of the bench cannot pay mere lip service to the 90-day requirement; he should instead persevere in its implementation.
[15]

Regarding directives from the OCA, judges should treat them as if
issued directly by the Court and comply promptly and conscientiously
with them since it is through the OCA that this Court exercises its
constitutionally mandated administrative supervision over all courts
and the personnel thereof. Failure to do so constitutes misconduct and
exacerbates administrative liability.


As to the penalty, the 
Rules of Court
 provides that undue delay in rendering a decision or order is a less serious charge
[16]
 which merits the imposition of any of the following sanctions:


 Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months; or


 A fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.
[17]

In the case at bar, suspension is not an option considering that Judge
Bagundang retired compulsorily on July 10, 2004. However, retirement
from the service does not preclude a finding of administrative
liability.
[18]

As recommended by the OCA, a fine of P20,000.00 is warranted under the
circumstances considering Judge Bagundangâs failure to explain his
failure to decide five cases and to resolve a pending motion within the
mandatory period, and his belated compliance with the OCA directives.

With respect to OIC Silongan, having been designated as acting clerk of
court, it was incumbent upon her to be cognizant of, and well-versed
with, the duties and responsibilities of a clerk of court. RTC-Sharif
Aguak, Maguindanao, is a single sala court. Under paragraph D (1.3),
Chapter VI of the 
2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court,
 the clerk of court of a single sala court performs the functions 
both
 of a Clerk of Court in a multiple sala court and those of a 
Branch

Clerk of Court. The Clerk of Court of a multiple sala court is the
administrative officer of the court and has control and supervision
over court personnel as well as over all its properties and supplies.
[19]
 The 
Branch

Clerk of Court is the extension of the Clerk of Court in the branch for
administrative purposes, and the custodian of all its properties and
premises.
[20]

In the case at bar, respondent Silongan failed to produce three hundred
and three (303) cases for examination by the audit team. She was
required to ascertain the actual status of these cases, and to submit a
report thereon, per OCA Memorandum dated March 24, 2003. She was
likewise required to explain why she failed to take appropriate actions
in twenty-two (22) civil cases since the cases have been raffled or
filed. It was not until the lapse of more than two years, however, or
in September 2005, that respondent Silongan submitted her compliance.

A clerk of court is the role model for all court employees under her
supervision. The position of clerk of court requires competence and
efficiency to insure the publicâs confidence in the administration of
justice.
[21]

With respect to court records, the clerk of court must ensure that they
are safely kept and readily available upon request of the parties or
order of the court.
[22]

In the case at bar, respondent Silongan failed to produce 303 cases
upon audit. The fact that RTC-Sharif Aguak is a single sala court and
staffed by a relatively small number of personnel is of no moment. The
organizational composition of a court is dependent upon its particular
needs and jurisdiction, and is presumed to be sufficient for its
purposes. It is therefore incumbent upon the clerk of court to
supervise court personnel in such a way that they all function
effectively.
[23]

Respondent Silonganâs knee ailment mitigates her administrative
liability but it does not exonerate her. A clerk of court cannot be
permitted to slacken on her job under one pretext or another.
[24]
 We agree with the OCA that respondent Silongan should be fined P1,000.00 for neglect of duty.


IN VIEW WHEREOF,
 Retired Judge Ismael G. Bagundang is found guilty of 
GROSS INEFFICIENCY,
 and 
FINED
 Twenty Thousand pesos (P20,000.00) to be deducted from his retirement benefits.


Officer-in-Charge Umaima L. Silongan, Interpreter III, RTC-Br. 15, Sharif Aguak, Maguindanao, is found guilty of 
NEGLECT OF DUTY,
 and 
FINED

One Thousand pesos (P1,000.00), with WARNING that a repetition of the
same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.


SO ORDERED.
