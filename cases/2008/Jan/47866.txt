On February 20, 2007, the Court noted OCA's Memorandum and adopted its recommendations. On March 15, 2007, respondent judge submitted her Compliance with the February 20, 2007 Resolution which was referred by the Court to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.
In a Memorandum dated June 8, 2007, the OCA recommended that: a) respondent judge be adjudged administratively liable for undue delay in rendering decisions and be fined in the amount of P20,000.00; and b) she be directed to decide with dispatch the cases covered by this administrative matter and furnish the OCA with copies of the decision within 10 days from its rendition.
In the herein assailed Resolution dated July 3, 2007, the Court adopted the OCA's recommendations and resolved to:
(a) ADJUDGE Judge Rebecca B. Mariano administratively liable for undue delay in rendering decisions and orders;
(b) FINE Judge Mariano in the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000);
(c) DIRECT Judge Mariano to DECIDE WITH DISPATCH the cases covered by this administrative matter;
(d) FURNISH the Office of the Court Administrator with copies of the decision within ten (10) days from their rendition; and
(e) NOTE the Letter dated June 19, 2007 of respondent Judge Rebecca R. Mariano, in compliance with the resolution of February 20, 2007 furnishing the Court with copy of the decision in SP Proc. Case No. M-6158, Civil Case No. 00-318 and Civil Case No. 03-264.
On November 14, 2007, respondent judge filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration with Motion for Leave to Admit Motion for Reconsideration. Respondent judge alleges that the infractions for which she was being fined in the amount of P20,000.00 were the same infractions for which she was previously fined P40,000.00. She thus prays that the Resolution dated July 3, 2007 imposing a fine of P20,000.00 be reversed and set aside.
Moreover, she prays that the Decision dated July 25, 2007 imposing on her a fine of P40,000.00 be reconsidered in light of her admission of her oversight vis-a-vis the case of 
Amanet, Inc. v. Eastern Telecommunications, Inc.
 and her lack of malicious intent to deliberately misrepresent the status of said case and other undecided cases. She also prays that her 43 years of public service; the fact that this is her first infraction; her failing health and her impending compulsory retirement in October 2008; be considered as mitigating circumstances.
The motion for reconsideration is partly granted.
It appears from the records that the infractions mentioned in the Resolution of July 3, 2007 and for which a fine of P20,000.00 is being imposed, were the same infractions for which respondent judge was previously fined P40,000.00, pursuant to the Decision dated January 25, 2007. Accordingly, the July 3, 2007 Resolution is hereby set aside.
Anent the fine of P40,000.00 earlier imposed upon respondent judge, records show that a motion for reconsideration was filed but it was denied with finality on February 27, 2007. In fact, respondent judge has paid the amount of P40,000.00 to the Court's Cash Collection and Disbursement Division on April 11, 2007 per O.R. No. 7402054.
ACCORDINGLY
, the Motion for Reconsideration of Judge Rebecca R. Mariano, Regional Trial Court, Makati City, Branch 136, is 
PARTLY GRANTED
. The Resolution dated July 3, 2007 imposing on her a fine of P20,000.00 is 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
.
SO ORDERED.
Puno, C.J., Quisumbing, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Azcuna, Tinga, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Reyes,
 and 
Leonardo-De Castro, JJ.
, concur.
Chico-Nazario, J.
, on official leave.
