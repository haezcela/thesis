BENJAMIN BITANGA, PETITIONER, VS. PYRAMID CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




CHICO-NAZARIO, J.:


Assailed in this Petition for Review under Rule 45
[1]
 of the Revised Rules of Court are: (1) the Decision
[2]
 dated 11 April 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 78007 which affirmed with modification the partial Decision
[3]
 dated 29 November 2002 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 96, of Quezon City, in Civil Case No. Q-01-45041, granting the motion for summary judgment filed by respondent Pyramid Construction and Engineering Corporation and declaring petitioner Benjamin Bitanga and his wife, Marilyn Bitanga (Marilyn), solidarily liable to pay P6,000,000.000 to respondent; and (2) the Resolution
[4]
 dated 5 July 2006 of the appellate court in the same case denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.
The generative facts are:
On 6 September 2001, respondent filed with the RTC a Complaint for specific performance and damages with application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment against the petitioner and Marilyn. The Complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-01-45041.
Respondent alleged in its Complaint that on 26 March 1997, it entered into an agreement with Macrogen Realty, of which petitioner is the President, to construct for the latter the Shoppers Gold Building, located at Dr. A. Santos Avenue corner Palayag Road, Sucat, ParaÃ±aque City. Respondent commenced civil, structural, and architectural works on the construction project by May 1997. However, Macrogen Realty failed to settle respondent's progress billings. Petitioner, through his representatives and agents, assured respondent that the outstanding account of Macrogen Realty would be paid, and requested respondent to continue working on the construction project. Relying on the assurances made by petitioner, who was no less than the President of Macrogen Realty, respondent continued the construction project.
In August 1998, respondent suspended work on the construction project since the conditions that it imposed for the continuation thereof, including payment of unsettled accounts, had not been complied with by Macrogen Realty. On 1 September 1999, respondent instituted with the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) a case for arbitration against Macrogen Realty
 
seeking payment by the latter of its unpaid billings and project costs. Petitioner, through counsel, then conveyed to respondent his purported willingness to amicably settle the arbitration case. On 17 April 2000, before the arbitration case could be set for trial, respondent and Macrogen Realty entered into a Compromise Agreement,
[5]
 with petitioner acting as signatory for and in behalf of Macrogen Realty. Under the Compromise Agreement, Macrogen Realty agreed to pay respondent the total amount of P6,000,000.00 in six equal monthly installments, with each installment to be delivered on the 15
th
 day of the month, beginning 15 June 2000. Macrogen Realty also agreed that if it would default in the payment of two successive monthly installments, immediate execution could issue against it for the unpaid balance, without need of judgment or decree from any court or tribunal. Petitioner guaranteed the obligations of Macrogen Realty under the Compromise Agreement by executing a Contract of Guaranty
[6]
 in favor of respondent, by virtue of which he irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the full and complete payment of the principal amount of liability of Macrogen Realty in the sum of P6,000,000.00. Upon joint motion of respondent and Macrogen Realty, the CIAC approved the Compromise Agreement on 25 April 2000.
[7]
However, contrary to petitioner's assurances, Macrogen Realty failed and refused to pay all the monthly installments agreed upon in the Compromise Agreement. Hence, on 7 September 2000, respondent moved for the issuance of a writ of execution
[8]
 against Macrogen Realty, which CIAC granted.
On 29 November 2000, the sheriff
[9]
 filed a return stating that he was unable to locate any property of Macrogen Realty, except its bank deposit of P20,242.33, with the Planters Bank, Buendia Branch.
Respondent then made, on 3 January 2001, a written demand
[10]
 on petitioner, as guarantor of Macrogen Realty, to pay the P6,000,000.00, or to point out available properties of the Macrogen Realty within the Philippines sufficient to cover the obligation guaranteed. It also made verbal demands on petitioner. Yet, respondent's demands were left unheeded.
Thus, according to respondent, petitioner's obligation as guarantor was already due and demandable. As to Marilyn's liability, respondent contended that Macrogen Realty was owned and controlled by petitioner and Marilyn and/or by corporations owned and controlled by them. Macrogen Realty is 99% owned by the Asian Appraisal Holdings, Inc. (AAHI), which in turn is 99% owned by Marilyn. Since the completion of the construction project would have redounded to the benefit of both petitioner and Marilyn and/or their corporations; and considering, moreover, Marilyn's enormous interest in AAHI, the corporation which controls Macrogen Realty, Marilyn cannot be unaware of the obligations incurred by Macrogen Realty and/or petitioner in the course of the business operations of the said corporation.
Respondent prayed in its Complaint that the RTC, after hearing, render a judgment ordering petitioner and Marilyn to comply with their obligation under the Contract of Guaranty by paying respondent the amount of P6,000,000.000 (less the bank deposit of Macrogen Realty with Planter's Bank in the amount of P20,242.23) and P400,000.000 for attorneys fees and expenses of litigation. Respondent also sought the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment as security for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be recovered in the case in its favor.
Marilyn filed a Motion to Dismiss,
[11]
 asserting that respondent had no cause of action against her, since she did not co-sign the Contract of Guaranty with her husband; nor was she a party to the Compromise Agreement between respondent and Macrogen Realty. She had no part at all in the execution of the said contracts. Mere ownership by a single stockholder or by another corporation of all or nearly all of the capital stock of another corporation is not by itself a sufficient ground for disregarding the separate personality of the latter corporation. Respondent misread Section 4, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court.
The RTC denied Marilyn's Motion to Dismiss for lack of merit, and in its Order dated 24 January 2002 decreed that:
The Motion To Dismiss Complaint Against Defendant Marilyn Andal Bitanga filed on November 12, 2001 is denied for lack of merit considering that Sec. 4, Rule 3, of the Rules of Court (1997) specifically provides, as follows:
"SEC. 4. Spouses as parties. - Husband and wife shall sue or be sued jointly, except as provided by law."
and that this case does not come within the exception.
[12]
Petitioner filed with the RTC on 12 November 2001, his Answer
[13]
 to respondent's Complaint averring therein that he never made representations to respondent that Macrogen Realty would faithfully comply with its obligations under the Compromise Agreement. He did not offer to guarantee the obligations of Macrogen Realty to entice respondent to enter into the Compromise Agreement but that, on the contrary, it was respondent that required Macrogen Realty to offer some form of security for its obligations before agreeing to the compromise. Petitioner further alleged that his wife Marilyn was not aware of the obligations that he assumed under both the Compromise Agreement and the Contract of Guaranty as he did not inform her about said contracts, nor did he secure her consent thereto at the time of their execution.
As a special and affirmative defense, petitioner argued that the benefit of excussion was still available to him as a guarantor since he had set it up prior to any judgment against him. According to petitioner, respondent failed to exhaust all legal remedies to collect from Macrogen Realty the amount due under the Compromise Agreement, considering that Macrogen Realty still had uncollected credits which were more than enough to pay for the same. Given these premise, petitioner could not be held liable as guarantor. Consequently, petitioner presented his counterclaim for damages.
At the pre-trial held on 5 September 2002, the parties submitted the following issues for the resolution of the RTC:
(1)
 
whether the defendants were liable under the contract of guarantee dated April 17, 2000 entered into between Benjamin Bitanga and the plaintiff;
 
(2)
 
whether defendant wife Marilyn Bitanga is liable in this action;
 
(3)
 
whether the defendants are entitled to the benefit of excussion, the plaintiff on the one hand claiming that it gave due notice to the guarantor, Benjamin Bitanga, and the defendants contending that no proper notice was received by Benjamin Bitanga;
 
(4)
 
if damages are due, which party is liable; and
 
(5)
 
whether the benefit of excussion can still be invoked by the defendant guarantor even after the notice has been allegedly sent by the plaintiff although proper receipt is denied.
[14]
On 20 September 2002, prior to the trial proper, respondent filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.
[15]
 Respondent alleged therein that it was entitled to a summary judgment on account of petitioner's admission during the pre-trial of the genuineness and due execution of the Contract of Guaranty. The contention of petitioner and Marilyn that they were entitled to the benefit of excussion was not a genuine issue. Respondent had already exhausted all legal remedies to collect from Macrogen Realty, but its efforts proved unsuccessful. Given that the inability of Macrogen Realty as debtor to pay the amount of its debt was already proven by the return of the writ of execution to CIAC unsatisfied, the liability of petitioner as guarantor already arose.
[16]
 In any event, petitioner and Marilyn were deemed to have forfeited their right to avail themselves of the benefit of excussion because they failed to comply with Article 2060
[17]
 of the Civil Code when petitioner ignored respondent's demand letter dated 3 January 2001 for payment of the amount he guaranteed.
[18]
 The duty to collect the supposed receivables of Macrogen Realty from its creditors could not be imposed on respondent, since petitioner and Marilyn never informed respondent about such uncollected credits even after receipt of the demand letter for payment. The allegation of petitioner and Marilyn that they could not respond to respondent's demand letter since they did not receive the same was unsubstantiated and insufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact which could defeat respondent's Motion for Summary Judgment. The claim that Marilyn never participated in the transactions that culminated in petitioner's execution of the Contract of Guaranty was nothing more than a sham.
In opposing respondent's foregoing Motion for Summary Judgment, petitioner and Marilyn countered that there were genuinely disputed facts that would require trial on the merits. They appended thereto an affidavit executed by petitioner, in which he declared that his spouse Marilyn could not be held personally liable under the Contract of Guaranty or the Compromise Agreement, nor should her share in the conjugal partnership be made answerable for the guaranty petitioner assumed, because his undertaking of the guaranty did not in any way redound to the benefit of their family. As guarantor, petitioner was entitled to the benefit of excussion, and he did not waive his right thereto. He never received the respondent's demand letter dated 3 January 2001, as Ms. Dette Ramos, the person who received it, was not an employee of Macrogen Realty nor was she authorized to receive the letter on his behalf. As a guarantor, petitioner could resort to the benefit of excussion at any time before judgment was rendered against him.
[19]
 Petitioner reiterated that Macrogen Realty had uncollected credits which were more than sufficient to satisfy the claim of respondent.
On 29 November 2002, the RTC rendered a partial Decision, the dispositive portion of which provides:
WHEREFORE, summary judgment is rendered ordering defendants SPOUSES BENJAMIN BITANGA and MARILYN ANDAL BITANGA to pay the [herein respondent], jointly and severally, the amount of P6,000,000.00, less P20,242.23 (representing the amount garnished bank deposit of MACROGEN in the Planters Bank, Buendia Branch); and the costs of suit.
Within 10 days from receipt of this partial decision, the [respondent] shall inform the Court whether it shall still pursue the rest of the claims against the defendants. Otherwise, such claims shall be considered waived.
[20]
Petitioner and Marilyn filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the afore-quoted Decision, which the RTC denied in an Order dated 26 January 2003.
[21]
In time, petitioner and Marilyn filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. CV 78007. In its Decision dated 11 April 2006, the appellate court held:
UPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS, the judgment appealed from must be, as it hereby is, MODIFIED to the effect that defendant-appellant Marilyn Bitanga is adjudged not liable, whether solidarily or otherwise, with her husband the defendant-appellant Benjamin Bitanga, under the compromise agreement or the contract of guaranty. No costs in this instance.
[22]
In holding that Marilyn Bitanga was not liable, the Court of Appeals cited 
Ramos v. Court of Appeals
,
[23]
 in which it was declared that a contract cannot be enforced against one who is not a party to it. The Court of Appeals stated further that the substantial ownership of shares in Macrogen Realty by Marilyn Bitanga was not enough basis to hold her liable.
The Court of Appeals, in its Resolution dated 5 July 2006, denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration
[24]
 of its earlier Decision.
Petitioner is now before us 
via 
the present Petition with the following assignment of errors:
I
THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE VALIDITY OF THE PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 96, DESPITE THE CLEAR EXISTENCE OF DISPUTED GENUINE AND MATERIAL FACTS OF THE CASE THAT SHOULD HAVE REQUIRED A TRIAL ON THE MERITS.
II
THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT UPHOLDING THE RIGHT OF PETITIONER BENJAMIN M. BITANGA AS A MERE GUARANTOR TO THE BENEFIT OF EXCUSSION UNDER ARTICLES 2058, 2059, 2060, 2061, AND 2062 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES.
[25]
As in the two courts below, it is petitioner's position that summary judgment is improper in Civil Case No. Q-01-45041 because there are genuine issues of fact which have to be threshed out during trial, to wit:
(A) Whether or not there was proper service of notice to petitioner considering the said letter of demand was allegedly received by one 
Dette
 Ramos 
at Macrogen office and not by him at his residence.
(B) Whether or not petitioner is entitled to the benefit of 
excussion
?
[26]
We are not persuaded by petitioner's arguments.
Rule 35 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure provides:
Section 1. 
Summary judgment for claimant
. - A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim or to obtain a declaratory relief may, at any time after the pleading in answer thereto has been served, move with supporting affidavits, depositions or admissions for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.
For a summary judgment to be proper, the movant must establish two requisites: (a) there must be no genuine issue as to any material fact, except for the amount of damages; and (b) the party presenting the motion for summary judgment must be entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Where, on the basis of the pleadings of a moving party, including documents appended thereto, no genuine issue as to a material fact exists, the burden to produce a genuine issue shifts to the opposing party. If the opposing party fails, the moving party is entitled to a summary judgment.
[27]
In a summary judgment, the crucial question is: are the issues raised by the opposing party not genuine so as to justify a summary judgment?
[28]
First off, we rule that the issue regarding the propriety of the service of a copy of the demand letter on the petitioner in his office is a sham issue. It is not a bar to the issuance of a summary judgment in respondent's favor.
A genuine issue is an issue of fact which requires the presentation of evidence as distinguished from an issue which is a sham, fictitious, contrived or false claim. To forestall summary judgment, it is essential for the non-moving party to confirm the existence of genuine issues, as to which he has substantial, plausible and fairly arguable defense, 
i.e.,
[29]
 issues of fact calling for the presentation of evidence upon which reasonable findings of fact could return a verdict for the non-moving party, although a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment will be insufficient to preclude entry thereof.
Significantly, petitioner does not deny the receipt of the demand letter from the respondent. He merely raises a howl on the impropriety of service thereof, stating that "the address to which the said letter was sent was not his residence but the office of Macrogen Realty, thus it cannot be considered as the correct manner of conveying a letter of demand upon him in his personal capacity."
[30]
Section 6, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court states:
SEC. 6. 
Personal service
. - Service of the papers may be made by delivering personally a copy to the party or his counsel, 
or by leaving it in his office with his clerk or with a person having charge thereof.
 If no person is found in his office, or his office is not known, or he has no office, then by leaving the copy, between the hours of eight in the morning and six in the evening, at the party's or counsel's residence, if known, with a person of sufficient age and discretion then residing therein.
The affidavit of Mr. Robert O. Pagdilao, messenger of respondent's counsel states in part:
 On 4 January 2001, Atty. Jose Vicente B. Salazar, then one of the Associates of the ACCRA Law Offices, instructed me to deliver to the office of Mr. Benjamin Bitanga a letter dated 3 January 2001, pertaining to Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (hereafter, "CIAC") Case No. 99-56, entitled "Pyramid Construction Engineering Corporation vs. Macrogen Realty Corporation."
 As instructed, I immediately proceeded to the office of Mr. Bitanga located at the 12
th
 Floor, Planters Development Bank Building, 
314 Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City
. I delivered the said letter to Ms. Dette Ramos, a person of sufficient age and discretion, who introduced herself as one of the employees of Mr. Bitanga and/or of the latter's companies.
[31]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
We emphasize that when petitioner signed the Contract of Guaranty and assumed obligation as guarantor, his address in the said contract was the same address where the demand letter was served.
[32]
 He does not deny that the said place of service, which is the office of Macrogen, was also the address that he used when he signed as guarantor in the Contract of Guaranty. Nor does he deny that this is his office address; instead, he merely insists that the person who received the letter and signed the receiving copy is not an employee of his company. Petitioner could have easily substantiated his allegation by a submission of an affidavit of the personnel manager of his office that no such person is indeed employed by petitioner in his office, but that evidence was not submitted.
[33]
 All things are presumed to have been done correctly and with due formality until the contrary is proved. This 
juris
 tantum
 presumption stands even against the most well-reasoned allegation pointing to some possible irregularity or anomaly.
[34]
 It is petitioner's burden to overcome the presumption by sufficient evidence, and so far we have not seen anything in the record to support petitioner's charges of anomaly beyond his bare allegation. Petitioner cannot now be heard to complain that there was an irregular service of the demand letter, as it does not escape our attention that petitioner himself indicated "
314 Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City
" as his office address in the Contract of Guaranty.
Moreover, under Section 6, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, there is sufficiency of service when the papers, or in this case, when the demand letter is personally delivered to the party or his counsel, 
or by leaving it in his office 
with his clerk or with a person having charge thereof
, such as what was done in this case.
We have consistently expostulated that in summary judgments, the trial court can determine a genuine issue on the basis of the pleadings, admissions, documents, affidavits or counter affidavits submitted by the parties. When the facts as pleaded appear uncontested or undisputed, then there is no real or genuine issue or question as to any fact, and summary judgment is called for.
[35]
The Court of Appeals was correct in holding that:
Here, the issue of non-receipt of the letter of demand is a sham or pretended issue, not a genuine and substantial issue. Indeed, against the positive assertion of Mr. Roberto O. Pagdilao (the private courier) in his affidavit that he delivered the subject letter to a certain Ms. Dette Ramos who introduced herself as one of the employees of [herein petitioner] Mr. Benjamin Bitanga and/or of the latter's companies, said [petitioner] merely offered a bare denial. But bare denials, unsubstantiated by facts, which would be admissible in evidence at a hearing,
 
are not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.
[36]
We further affirm the findings of both the RTC and the Court of Appeals that, given the settled facts of this case, petitioner cannot avail himself of the benefit of excussion.
Under a contract of guarantee, the guarantor binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the principal debtor in case the latter should fail to do so. The guarantor who pays for a debtor, in turn, must be indemnified by the latter. However, the guarantor cannot be compelled to pay the creditor unless the latter has exhausted all the property of the debtor and resorted to all the legal remedies against the debtor. This is what is otherwise known as the benefit of excussion.
[37]
Article 2060 of the Civil Code reads:
Art. 2060. In order that the guarantor may make use of the benefit of excussion, he must set it up against the creditor upon the latter's demand for payment from him, and point out to the creditor available property of the debtor within Philippine territory, sufficient to cover the amount of the debt.
[38]
The afore-quoted provision imposes a condition for the invocation of the defense of excussion. Article 2060 of the Civil Code clearly requires that in order for the guarantor to make use of the benefit of excussion, he must set it up against the creditor upon the latter's demand for payment and point out to the creditor available property of the debtor within the Philippines sufficient to cover the amount of the debt.
[39]
It must be stressed that despite having been served a demand letter at his office, petitioner still failed to point out to the respondent properties of Macrogen Realty sufficient to cover its debt as required under Article 2060 of the Civil Code. Such failure on petitioner's part forecloses his right to set up the defense of excussion.
Worthy of note as well is the Sheriff's return stating that the only property of Macrogen Realty which he found was its deposit of P20,242.23 with the Planters Bank.
Article 2059(5) of the Civil Code thus finds application and precludes petitioner from interposing the defense of excussion. We quote:
Art. 2059. This excussion shall not take place:
x x x x
(5) If it may be presumed that an execution on the property of the principal debtor would not result in the satisfaction of the obligation.
As the Court of Appeals correctly ruled:
We find untenable the claim that the [herein petitioner] Benjamin Bitanga cannot be compelled to pay Pyramid because the Macrogen Realty has allegedly sufficient assets. Reason: The said [petitioner] had not genuinely controverted the return made by Sheriff Joseph F. Bisnar, who affirmed that, after exerting diligent efforts, he was not able to locate any property belonging to the Macrogen Realty, except for a bank deposit with the Planter's Bank at Buendia, in the amount of P20,242.23. It is axiomatic that the liability of the guarantor arises when the insolvency or inability of the debtor to pay the amount of debt is proven by the return of the writ of execution that had not been unsatisfied.
[40]
IN ALL, we fail to point out any impropriety in the rendition of a summary judgment in favor of the respondent.
Wherefore
, premises considered, the instant petition is 
DENIED
 for lack of merit. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 11 April 2006 and its Resolution dated 5 July 2006 are 
affirmed
. Costs against petitioner.

 Other relevant provisions of the Civil Code reads:
Art. 2058. The guarantor cannot be compelled to pay the creditor unless the latter has exhausted all the property of the debtor, and has resorted to all the legal remedies against the debtor.
Art. 2061. The guarantor having fulfilled all the conditions required in the preceding article, the creditor who is negligent in exhausting the property pointed out shall suffer the loss, to the extent of said property, for the insolvency of the debtor resulting from such negligence.
Art. 2062. In every action by the creditor, which must be against the principal debtor alone, except in the cases mentioned in article 2059, the former shall ask the court to notify the guarantor of the action. The guarantor may appear so that he may, if he so desire, set up such defenses as are granted him by law. The benefit of excussion mentioned in article 2058 shall always be unimpaired, even if judgment should be rendered against the principal debtor and the guarantor in case of appearance by the latter.
