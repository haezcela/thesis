LEONEN, SAJ.:


This Court resolves the consolidated Petitions for Certiorari under Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, filed by various officials and employees from regional and provincial offices of the National Food Authority. They assail the disallowance of the National Food Authority's food and grocery incentives for various years.
Escarez v. Commission on Audit
[1]
 and 
Wycoco v. Aquino
[2]
 have settled the issues raised in these Petitions. In both cases, this Court found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission on Audit and affirmed the disallowance of the food and grocery incentives.
Since 1995, with the agriculture secretary's approval, the National Food Authority "has been giving food gift packages to all of its officials and employees."
[3]
 Later, the food gift packages "were converted into gift checks."
[4]
In 1998, President Joseph Estrada (President Estrada) approved the request of then National Food Authority Administrator Eduardo Nonato N. Joson "for the grant of Food Assistance and Emergency Allowance in the amount of P7,000.00 to all [National Food Authority] officials and employees."
[5]
 The Letter reads:
December 8, 1998
HIS EXCELLENCY JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA
President
Republic of the Philippines
MalacaÃ±ang, Manila
Dear Mr. President:
This refers to the attached approved granting of Food Assistance & Emergency Allowance to all employees of the Office of the President in the amount of Seven Thousand Pesos ((P7,000.00).
Executive Order No. 2 placed the NFA under the Office of the President, upholding our mandate on food security and food stabilization. Likewise, Executive Order No. 22 tasked our agency to extend our services to the people through timely intervention on non-grains commodity trading in time of crisis or calamity. To this end, we would like to ensure your excellency that we will do our best.
Hence, as a sense of gratitude to the hardwork and dedication by our employees, I personally see it fit that the Food Assistance & Emergency Allowance given to the employees of the Office of the President be extended to NFA officials and employees.
In the spirit of the Yuletide season and the thought of alleviating the economic status of our employees even in this Christmas season, we hope for your consideration and approval.
Again, MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
 (Sgd.)
 EDUARDO NONATO N. JOSON
Administrator
Approved/disapproved:
(Sgd.)
JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA
President
[6]
President Estrada's approval became the basis "for the continued granting of the benefit to all [National Food Authority] officials and employees."
[7]
In 2003, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (President Macapagal-Arroyo) recognized the authority of the government financial institutions' and government-owned or controlled corporations' heads to grant Christmas/year-end bonuses in addition to 13
th
 month pay and P5,000.00 cash gift,
[8]
 with the reminder that the grant should be in moderation.
[9]
The Memorandum partly reads:
The Cabinet, at its meeting with the Executive Secretary held today [November 4. 2003], discussed the proposal to grant to the national government employees the amount of not more than P5,000 as year-end bonus in addition to the regular year-end/Christmas/13
th
 month pay consisting of their basic salary plus P5000 in cash only. During the discussion it was mentioned that these national government employees might be disgruntled if other employees of state entities received extremely high bonuses.
In view thereof, the Cabinet agreed to request the heads of the government financial institutions, and the government owned or controlled corporations to moderate their granting of bonuses to their employees.
Although the Cabinet Members are aware that finances are corporate board matters, they appeal to the good sense of the Boards on this particular case.
Thank you for your continued cooperation. 
 
 
(Sgd.)
 Ricardo L. Saludo
[10]
Then, upon the National Food Authority's request, the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel issued OGCC Opinion No. 219.
[11]
 It states:
It is our opinion that the grant of food subsidy/grocery incentive in the form of gift cheques as traditionally done during the Christmas season is in order. Last November 4, 2003, the Office of the President (OP), through Honorable Secretary Ricardo L. Saludo issued a Memorandum relative to the grant of Christmas/year-end bonuses by the Heads of Government Financial Institutions and the Government Owned and Controlled Corporations to their employees in addition to the mandatory 13
th
 month pay and P5,000.00 cash gift.
The aforementioned Memorandum while directing that the exercise of the authority to grant bonuses be in moderation, in effect took cognizant [sic] or recognized the said authority to grant Christmas/year-end bonuses by the Heads or GFIs and GOCCs to their employees.
The subject DBM Circular you referred in your letter was issued October 17, 2003 while the Memorandum of Hon. Secretary Saludo was issued much later, that is on November 4, 2003. Hence, for all intents and purposes, it is safe to conclude that it is the intention of the Office of the President to extend and allow the grant of additional bonus denominated as Christmas/year-end bonus to the employees of government owned and controlled corporations.
The grant of additional benefits which have been traditionally given to the employees of government owned and controlled corporations was likewise recognized in the case of National Tobacco Administration, et[] al. vs. the Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 119385, August 5, 1999), where the Supreme Court set aside and lifted COA's disallowance of similar benefits which were traditionally given to officers and employees of the National Tobacco Administration.
[12]
In 2005, the National Food Authority Council approved NFA Resolution No. 226-2K5, granting the P20,000.00 food and grocery incentive for each employee of the National Food Authority as a yuletide incentive.
[13]
 The Resolution states:
RESOLUTION NO. 226-2K5
RESOLVED, AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED THAT, the NFA Council, upon the recommendation of Management, hereby approves the grant of Food/Grocery Incentive (FGI) annually in the amount of P20,000 per NFA Council Official/NFA employees whether permanent or temporary, and other qualified personnel as maybe [sic] defined in the implementing guidelines, subject to accounting and auditing rules, DBM issuances and other pertinent laws.
RESOLVED FURTHER THAT, the schedule of release shall not be later than June 15 of every year for the first P10,000 and the remaining P10,000 not later than October 15.
[14]
In 2007, National Food Authority Administrator Jessup P. Navarro issued NFA Memorandum AO-2K7-02-024, or the Revised Guidelines on the Grant of the Food/Grocery Incentive for 2007 and Years Thereafter.
[15]
Later, the Commission on Audit issued Notices of Disallowance covering the food and grocery incentives granted for various years.

[22]
Regional Manager Alan B. Borja, on behalf of concerned regional and provincial officials and employees of the Commission on Audit Regional Office No. V, filed an Appeal Memorandum requesting that the disallowance be set aside.
[23]
 Piolito C. Santos (Santos) also filed a separate Appeal Memorandum requesting the same.
[24]
Eden Redillas filed an Appeal Memorandum for Notice of Disallowance No. 2012-05-01(2011); however, she filed it out of time, the Notice of Disallowance attained finality.
[25]
Oscar Tubalinal filed an Appeal Memorandum for Notice of Disallowance No. 12-001-101 (11).
[26]
Commission on Audit Regional Director for Region V Eden T. Rafanan issued ROV Consolidated Decision No. 2014-C-001
[27]
 on January 3, 2014, denying the appeals based on the following:
The grant of FGI violates RA No. 6758 which incorporated all allowances and benefits in the salaries of government employees and required any additional allowances to be made pursuant to a law or subject to the approval of the President of the Philippines;
The disallowance of FGI does not violate the principle of non-Â­diminution of pay pursuant to the ruling of the Supreme Court in a long line of cases that there is no diminution of pay [o]f the disallowed allowances or benefits were not granted to incumbent government employees on or before July 1, 1989, the date of effectivity of RA No. 6758. Hence, FGI, which was only granted by NFA in 1995, does not fall under the category of benefits that can continually be granted;
The NDs were validly issued pursuant to the mandate of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, the Administrative Code of 1987, and PD No. 1445, that COA has the exclusive authority to define the scope of its audit and examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds or properties;
The act of certifying and approving the FGI is not ministerial act even if it was made pursuant to Memorandum No. AO-2K7-02-024 and NFA Council Resolution No. 226-2K5. The officers responsible for the funds of NFA have the duty to ascertain if the disbursements were made in accordance with laws, rules and regulations before they affixed their signatures. Otherwise, they can only be relieved from liability if they notified in writing their superior officers of the illegality of payment, as mandated by Section 106 of PD No. 1445; and
The Deed of Undertaking contained in the grant of FGI requiring the recipients thereof to refund the same if it is disallowed shows that the NFA administration was aware that the grant of FGI may be disallowed by COA. Thus, good faith, which presupposes an honest belief and freedom of knowledge of any defect and circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry, is lacking.
[28]
 (Citations omitted)
Thus, the concerned officials and employees filed a Petition for Review before the Commission on Audit Proper, but this was denied in COA Decision No. 2016-434
[29]
 dated December 27, 2016. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:

[174]
 Their Petition for Review before the Commission on Audit Proper was likewise denied in COA Decision No. 2018-292
[175]
 dated March 15, 2018. The dispositive portion reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review of concerned official and employees of the National Food Authority (NFA)-Â­South District Office, Taguig City, represented by Mr. Roberto S. Musngi, in his capacity as Manager, of Commission on Audit Corporate Government Sector-Cluster 5 Decision No. 2014-006 dated August 11, 2014, is DENIED for lack of merit. Accordingly, Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2014-001(2012) dated May 15, 2014, on the payment of Food and Grocery Incentive (FGI) to the agency officials and employees for calendar year 2012, in the total amount of P1,100,000.00, is AFFIRMED. Moreover, Ms. Lagrimas M. Aguilar, Cashier III, shall remain liable only to the extent of the amount she received as payee and not solidarity liable for the entire disallowance.
The Supervising Auditor is directed to evaluate the participation of the members of the NFA Council in approving the grant of FGI, and to issue a Supplemental ND, if warranted.
[176]
The Motion for Reconsideration was also denied. Thus, a Petition for Certiorari was filed.
[177]
In all its questioned rulings, the Commission on Audit has consistently affirmed the disallowance of food and grocery incentives as their grant lacked legal basis.
[178]
The Commission on Audit explained that save for those expressly exempted, Republic Act No. 6758 mandated that all allowances, including food and grocery incentives, would already be deemed "integrated into the standardized salary rates."
[179]
 It also cited Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular No. 16, which proscribed the grant of food and grocery incentives except when authorized by an administrative order.
[180]
 The National Food Authority grounded the incentive grant only on President Estrada's approval and President Macapagal-Arroyo's Memorandum, and OGCC Opinion No. 219, among others. To the Commission on Audit, these did not form the authority required by law.
[181]
On the argument that the disallowance was a diminution of benefits, the Commission on Audit explained that the good-faith defense only applied to benefits not integrated into the standardized salary rate and were given to employees as of July 1, 1989. Since the benefits given in these cases were granted only since 1998, the recipients could not have been entitled in the first place, which means that there was no diminution of benefits. Following the rule on 
solutio indebiti
, they were bound to return the disallowed amounts.
[182]
As for the good-faith defense, the Commission on Audit held that the recipients lacked good faith since the food and grocery incentives had previously been disallowed. Moreover, they issued Deeds of Undertaking that authorized the deduction of benefits from their salaries should the food and grocery incentives be disallowed.
[183]
The Petitions now before this Court against public respondent Commission on Audit were separately filed between 2018
[184]
 and 2020.
[185]
 They involve various Notices of Disallowance issued to provincial and regional offices of the National Food Authority, encompassing food and grocery incentives for several years.
The Commission on Audit was required to comment only in G.R. Nos. 236503,
[186]
 240593,
[187]
 249689,
[188]
 241717,
[189]
 and 252357.
[190]
 However, since the issues in these consolidated Petitions are similar, and the Commission on Audit is the sole respondent, the Comments it filed would likewise address the issues raised in the other Petitions. Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 237549, 237550, 237551, and 249689
[191]
 were required to file their reply.
Petitioners in these consolidated cases raise similar arguments.
First, they say that the grant of food and grocery incentives is supported by the approval given by President Estrada in 1998 and the Memorandum of President Macapagal-Arroyo, through Secretary Ricardo L. Saludo, in 2003.
[192]
Petitioners cite Section 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 16, which states that "all agencies are prohibited from granting food, rice, gift checks or any other form of incentives/allowances except those authorized via Administrative Order by the Office of the President."
[193]
 DBM Budget Circular No. 16 was issued to implement Republic Act No. 6758, or the Compensation and Position Classification Act. Petitioners say that the two presidents' issuances are administrative orders in accordance with the statute and the circular.
[194]
Second, petitioners say that the National Food Authority Council's approval of Resolution No. 226-2K5 also justifies the validity of the food and grocery incentives' grant.
[195]
Third, petitioners argue that the food and grocery incentives have been granted since 1995,
[196]
 and thus, can be considered benefits traditionally given that can no longer be disallowed without violating the principle of equity.
[197]
 Petitioners cite
[198]
 
National Tobacco Administration v. Commission on Audit
,
[199]
 where it was held that "disallowing the [educational assistance], where funds are available as in the case under consideration, would be violative of the principle of equity."
[200]
 Petitioners say that the disallowance also violates the principle of non-diminution of benefits.
[201]
Fourth, petitioners argue that the grant of the food and grocery incentives as a traditionally given benefit is supported by OGCC Opinion No. 219, which states that it is "in the form of gift cheques as traditionally done during Christmas season is in order."
[202]
Fifth, assuming that the incentives were properly disallowed, petitioners invoke the ruling in 
Escarez v. Commission on Audit
,
[203]
 where this Court ruled that there was no need for the employees to return the benefits and incentives received in good faith.
[204]
In its Comments filed in G.R. Nos. 236503, 237549, 237550, 237551, 241717, 249689, and 252357 through the Office of the Solicitor General, the Commission on Audit raises similar arguments.
First, it maintains that there was no grave abuse of discretion on its part since the grant of food and grocery incentives had no legal basis.
[205]
 It notes that President Estrada's approval of the grant of food assistance and emergency allowance in 1998 is not an administrative order. Under the Administrative Code, administrative orders refer to issuances by the president, as administrative head, relating to certain aspects of governmental operations.
[206]
 The grant of food and grocery incentives, says the Commission on Audit, cannot be considered a matter relating to governmental operations since it is only of temporary interest; that is, only for 1998.
[207]
Likewise, it says that President Macapagal-Arroyo's Memorandum appears to be only for 2003, as she even specified that the yearend bonus shall not be more than P5,000.00, contrary to the P20,000.00 granted as food and grocery incentives.
[208]
The Commission also claims that since NFA Council Resolution No. 226-2K5 was not authorized by the president or by Congress, it is not a valid justification for the grant of the food and grocery incentives.
[209]
 Similarly, OGCC Opinion No. 219 does not justify the grant, it being based on Republic Act No. 6758, whose implementation is vested in the Department of Budget and Management. It asserts that the opinion cannot circumvent the provisions of the statute and the budget circular.
[210]
The grant of food and grocery incentives violates Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758,
[211]
 which provides:
SECTION 12. 
Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation
. â All allowances, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM, shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein prescribed. Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.
Existing additional compensation of any national government official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and shall be paid by the National Government.
The Commission on Audit adds that the National Food Authority also violated the Section 15(d) of the General Appropriations Act of 1999, which prohibits the payment of honoraria, allowances, or other forms of compensation to any government official or employee, except when specifically authorized by law; paragraph 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 16, which prohibits the grant of food, rice, gift checks, or any other form of incentives or allowances, except those authorized through an administrative order by the Office of the President; and Section 33 of the Civil Service Decree, which requires the incentive awards system to be administered under such rules, regulations, and standards as may be promulgated by the Civil Service Commission.
[212]
The Commission on Audit also claims that since petitioners were never entitled to receive food and grocery incentives, their argument that the disallowance means a diminution of benefits will not hold.
[213]
 It asserts that 
National Tobacco Administration
 does not apply because the food and grocery incentives were granted after Republic Act No. 6758 had been passed,
[214]
 and cannot be considered as a "traditional benefit[.]"
[215]
 Instead, 
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System v. Commission on Audit
[216]
 is instructive that allowances form part of the standardized salary, "unless excluded by law or by an issuance by [the Department of Budget and Management.]"
[217]
The Commission on Audit also argues that petitioners were not in good faith, saying that Notices of Disallowance were issued for the food and grocery incentives released in years past.
[218]
 Moreover, petitioners' lack of good faith is allegedly shown by the Deeds of Undertaking they undertook.
[219]
 These documents authorized salary deductions in case the food and grocery incentives would be disallowed.
[220]
 This indicates that petitioners were aware of the irregularity of the expenditure.
[221]
 None of the petitioners, says the Commission, refuted the Deeds of Undertaking.
[222]
Specifically for G.R. Nos. 237549 and 237550, the Commission on Audit argues that the Petitions should be dismissed due to procedural infirmities such as the failure to attach copies of NFA Council Resolution No. 226-2K5, NFA Memorandum No. AO-2K7-02-024, the December 8, 1998 Letter of the National Food Authority Administrator, President Macapagal-Â­Arroyo's Memorandum, and OGCC Opinion No. 219.
[223]
Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 237549, 237550, and 237551 filed a Consolidated Reply.
[224]
On the procedural matter, petitioners argue that the lack of attachments was due to mere inadvertence,
[225]
 and in any case, it was remedied when petitioners filed their Reply with Attachments in both G.R. Nos. 237549 and 237550, as noted by this Court on August 28, 2018.
[226]
 Moreover, they say that the documents "were already presented, evaluated, discussed[,] and appreciated" in 
Escarez
.
[227]
 Since they have become part of jurisprudence, petitioners argue, they should have been taken notice as the same documents were adjudicated in 
Escarez
.
[228]
On the substantive issues, petitioners argue that they are in good faith, saying that they only signed the Deeds of Undertaking as a precondition for the release of their food and grocery incentives. They raise that they are unfamiliar with its legal consequences.
[229]
Petitioners who approved the payment of food and grocery incentives also argue that they should not be held personally liable for the disallowed benefits. They point out that they were not the actual "approving officials" that granted the incentives, but the National Food Authority Council members.
[230]
Petitioners cite the manifestation and motion filed by the Office of the Solicitor General in 
Wycoco
, where it advocated that the recipients believed that they were entitled to the food and grocery incentives and the approving officials honestly believed that there was legal basis to support the grant.
[231]
Petitioners in G.R. No. 249689 filed a Reply,
[232]
 reiterating that the National Food Authority employees should not be required to return the benefits received, citing 
Escarez
 and 
Wycoco
.
[233]
 They add that "the nonÂ­ refund of the disallowed [food and grocery incentives] would be a great financial comfort to the recipients ... especially during this time of [the COVID-19] pandemic[.]"
[234]
 They pray that this Court grant the Petition with compassion.
[235]
Based on the arguments raised by the parties, the issues for this Court's resolution are:
first, whether or not the Commission on Audit gravely abused its discretion when it upheld the Notices of Disallowance; and
second, whether or not the Commission on Audit gravely abused its discretion when it required the officials and employees of the National Food Authority to refund the food and grocery incentives even though they were allegedly received in good faith.
This Court dismisses the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 236503, 237550, 237698, 237841, 240593, and 241717.
This Court partially grants the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 236282, 237549, 237551, 237552, and 237562-63, 237585, 240891, 249689, 252355, and 252357.
I
The Commission on Audit is a constitutional body tasked to "examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the [g]overnment, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters[.]"
[236]
 It is also tasked to prevent irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant expenditures and granted the power to disallow such expenditures.
[237]
The grant of food and grocery incentives has no legal basis. On this ground, the Commission on Audit committed no grave abuse of discretion when it upheld the Notices of Disallowance issued by its auditors to the various offices of the National Food Authority.
National Tobacco Administration v. Commission on Audit
,
[238]
 which petitioners frequently cited, does not apply. The questioned benefit in that case, educational assistance, had legal basis. This Court held that the benefit was covered by Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758, the second sentence of which provides that "[s]uch other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized." Moreover, the educational assistance had been given before Republic Act No. 6758 took effect.
[239]
 In contrast, the food and grocery incentives in these cases were given long after the law had taken effect.
Petitioners cited several issuances
[240]
 to support their argument that the grant of food and grocery incentives was authorized. However, the issuances they cited have previously been held by this Court as insufficient to set aside the Notices of Disallowance.
Escarez v. Commission on Audit
,
[241]
 reiterated in the consolidated cases of 
Wycoco v. Aquino
,
[242]
 settled whether the Commission on Audit gravely abused its discretion when it disallowed the grant of food and grocery incentives. This Court found no grave abuse, as the grant had no legal basis.
[243]
Escarez
 and 
Wycoco
 involved similar sets of facts: The food and grocery incentives granted to National Food Authority employees were disallowed by the Commission on Audit. As this Court held in 
Escarez
:
The Constitution has granted COA exclusive authority and enough latitude to determine, prevent and disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. The general policy of this Court is to sustain the decisions of COA, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers, but also on the basis of the latter's expertise in the interpretation of accounting and auditing rules and regulations that it is entrusted to promulgate and enforce.
We find no reason to depart from this principle, as it is clear that the findings of COA were based on cogent legal grounds.
What President Estrada approved was the grant of the Food Assistance and Emergency Allowance in the amount of P7,000 for the yuletide season in the year 1998. Nothing in the letter gave the impression that the grant of the benefit shall be an annual practice.
On the other hand, the purported approval by President MacapagalÂ­-Arroyo consisted of a Memorandum dated 4 November 2003 issued by the Cabinet Secretary Ricardo L. Saludo. In it, the cabinet members appealed to the good sense of the heads and boards of government financial institutions and government-owned and -controlled corporations to moderate the grant of year-end bonuses to their employees.
On the other hand, OGCC Opinion No. 219 dated 24 November 2003 looked with favor on the NFA's grant of food subsidy/grocery incentive in the form of gift checks to its officials and employees as had traditionally been done during the Christmas season.
As correctly observed by COA, these justifications consistently relate to the grant of additional incentives to NFA officials and employees during the Christmas season. It is well to note that the FGI in question was released in specific months of the year, not one tranche of which coincided with the yuletide season.
As provided under paragraph 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 16 dated 28 November 1998, agencies are prohibited from granting any food, rice, gift checks, or any other form of incentives/allowances, except those authorized by the Office of the President through an administrative order.
Thus, without specific authority from the President or Congress, the NFA Council Resolution cannot by itself serve as a justification for the release of the FGI.
[244]
The issuances used by the petitioners in 
Escarez
 and 
Wycoco
 were the same issuances cited by petitioners here.
[245]
 Under the principle of 
res judicata
, the rulings in 
Escarez
 and 
Wycoco
 on the issuances apply here.
Again, the grant of the food and grocery incentives had no legal basis. Therefore, they were properly disallowed.
II
Petitioners pray that the ruling in 
Escarez
, where the officials and employees were no longer held liable to return the disallowed amounts, be applied to all their cases. They claim that they similarly should no longer be liable to return the amounts they had received.
However, in 
Wycoco
, this Court clarified that the ruling in 
Escarez
 is conclusive only as to the disallowance, but not as to the liability of the approving officers and recipients.
[246]
Each Notice of Disallowance questioned in these consolidated cases has circumstances peculiar to it. Thus, the determination of who should be held liable must be made on a case-to-case basis.
[247]
In reviewing the assailed Commission on Audit Decisions and Notices of Disallowance, we apply the pronouncements in 
Madera v. Commission on Audit
[248]
 and 
Abellanosa v. Commission on Audit
.
[249]
 These cases harmonized existing jurisprudence on disallowances, particularly on the obligation to return disallowed benefits and whether liability should be solidary.
Madera
 laid down the following guidelines for cases involving disallowances:
If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.
If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:
Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.
Approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarity liable to return only the net disallowed amount which, as discussed herein, excludes amounts excused under the following sections 2c and 2d.
Recipients â whether approving or certifying officers or mere passive recipients â are liable to return the disallowed amounts respectively received by them, unless they are able to show that the amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered.
The Court may likewise excuse the return of recipients based on undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other 
bona fide
 exceptions as it may determine on a case[-]to[-]case basis.
[250]
The matrix laid down in a separate opinion in 
Madera
 serves as guide laying down objective factors as to who should be held liable and to what extent, considering the nature of the disallowance:  
Nature of Disallowance
Presumption and Liability
Extent of Obligation for Refund
Illegal, Irregular
Authorizing officer
Not liable if the following are present:
 1) Certificate of availability of funds;
 2) In-house or Department of Justice legal opinion;
3) No precedent disallowing a similar case in jurisprudence;
 4) It is traditionally practiced within the agency and no prior disallowance has been issued; and
5) There is a reasonable textual interpretation on its legality.
 
Recipients
Generally, not liable
Except
 if the recipients participated in the negotiations for the implementation and release of the benefits.
Exception to exception:
Recipient is a rank-and-file employee who was absent during the negotiations and did not ratify the agreement releasing the benefit.
Solidary, but see 
Rotoras
 v. Commission on Audit
 regarding extent.
Unnecessary
Authorizing officers and recipients are not liable, unless it is shown that expenditures are purposely or knowingly made.
Solidary, but see 
Rotoras v. Commission on Audit
 regarding extent.
Excessive, Extravagant, Unconscionable, Ostentatious 
Authorizing officers and recipients are liable.
Entire amount is disallowed.
[251]
Thus, if good faith is invoked as a defense, 
Madera
 teaches how to determine good faith when the nature of the disallowance is for illegal or irregular expenditures:
For one to be absolved of liability, the following requisites must be present: (1) a certificate of availability of funds, pursuant to Section 40 of the Administrative Code; (2) an in-house or a Department of Justice legal opinion; (3) lack of jurisprudence disallowing a similar case; (4) the issuance of the benefit is traditionally practiced within the agency and no prior disallowance has been issued; and (5) on the question of law, that there is a reasonable textual interpretation on the expenditure or benefit's legality.
[252]
Abellanosa
 expounded on the 
Madera
 rules. There, this Court held that approving or authorizing officers will generally not be held liable as they are presumed to have regularly performed their official duties, except when they acted in bad faith, with malice, or in gross negligence.
[253]
 Under Book I, Chapter 9, Section 38(1) of the Administrative Code, "[a] public officer shall not be civilly liable for acts done in the performance of his official duties, unless there is a clear showing of bad faith, malice or gross negligence."
On the liability of payees or recipients of benefits, 
Abellanosa
 clarifies Rule 2c of the 
Madera
 rules and lists two requisites for it to apply:
(a)
the personnel incentive or benefit has proper basis in law but is only disallowed due to irregularities that are merely procedural in nature; and
(b)
the personnel incentive or benefit must have a clear, direct, and reasonable connection to the actual performance of the payeeÂ­ recipient's official work and functions for which the benefit or incentive was intended as further compensation.
[254]
The two requisites are intended "to prevent the indiscriminate and loose invocation of Rule 2c of the 
Madera
 Rules on Return which may virtually result in the practical inability of the government to recover."
[255]
Abellanosa
 also discussed the proper application of Rule 2d of the 
Madera
 rules:
In 
Madera
, the Court also recognized that the existence of undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other 
bona fide
 exceptions, as determined on a case-to-case basis, may also negate the strict application of 
solutio indebiti
. This exception was borne from the recognition that in certain instances, the attending facts of a given case may furnish an equitable basis for the payees to retain the amounts they had received. While Rule 2d is couched in broader language as compared to Rule 2c, the application of Rule 2d should always remain true to its purpose: it must constitute a 
bona fide
 instance which strongly impels the Court to prevent a clear inequity arising from a directive to return.
[256]
Abellanosa
 clarified that 
Madera
 should not be construed in a manner that would cause fiscal losses to the government.
[257]
 It held:
It is important to rein in Rules 2c and 2d of the 
Madera
 Rules on Return because their application has a direct bearing on the resulting amount to be returned by erring approving/authorizing officers civilly held liable under Section 38, in relation to Section 43, of the Administrative Code. In 
Madera
, the Court explained that when recipients are excused to return disallowed amounts for the reason that they were genuinely made in consideration of services rendered, or for some other bona fide exception determined by the Court on a case to case basis, the erring approving/authorizing officers' solidary obligation for the disallowed amount is net of the amounts excused to be returned by the recipients (net disallowed amount).
[258]
Added the Court, Rules 2c and 2d involve exceptional circumstances, and should not be "haphazardly applied as an excuse for non-return[.]"
[259]
Here, the assailed Commission on Audit Decisions state that petitioners executed Deeds of Undertaking, negating the defense of good faith.
[260]
While good faith may still be invoked as a defense, it would not automatically excuse the payee from returning the amount received. In 
Madera
 and 
Abellanosa
, this Court has been strict in applying Rules 2c and 2d of the 
Madera
 rules.
This Court held in 
Wycoco
 that the recipients of the food and grocery incentives received the benefit by mistake, warranting the rule on 
solutio indebiti
 under Article 2154
[261]
 of the Civil Code to apply. 
Wycoco
 also reiterated that Rules 2c and 2d of the 
Madera
 rules should be strictly applied.
Again, a payee or recipient may be in good faith but the duty to return remains because of 
solutio indebiti
. Only exceptional circumstances would persuade this Court to excuse payees from their obligation to return what was mistakenly received.
As for the approving, certifying, and other accountable officers, we apply Section 106 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, or the Government Auditing Code:
SECTION 106. Liability for acts done by direction of superior officer. No accountable officer shall be relieved from liability by reason of his having acted under the direction of a superior officer in paying out, applying, or disposing of the funds or property with which he is chargeable, 
unless prior to that act, he notified the superior officer in writing of the illegality of the payment, application, or disposition
. The officer directing any illegal payment or disposition of the funds or property shall be primarily liable for the loss, while the accountable officer who fails to serve the required notice shall be secondarily liable. (Emphasis supplied)
Guided by 
Escarez, Wycoco, Madera, Abellanosa
, and Presidential Decree No. 1445, we now rule on the issue of liability of the approving officials and the recipients of the food and grocery incentives.
III
All petitioners in these cases must return the benefits received. Of the 19 assailed Commission on Audit Decisions, 17 mentioned that the Notices of Disallowance had previously been issued to various offices of the National Food Authority disallowing the same benefit.
[262]
While the 
Madera
 rules admit exceptions, none applies here.
First, Rule 2c does not apply because the grant of food and grocery incentives has no basis in law and has no reasonable connection with the work performance of the payee-recipient.
Second, Rule 2d also does not apply because petitioners have not shown the existence of undue prejudice, social justice considerations, or other factors that would convince this Court that they should not be required to return the benefits received.
We reviewed the liability of the approving and certifying officers. We recognize that they may have believed in good faith that there was legal basis for the food and grocery incentives because of the approval of former presidents, issuance of OGCC Opinion No. 219, and the lack of disallowance for several years.
However, some of the Petitions show that there were previous disallowances but the approving and certifying officers continued to approve the release of the incentives. In these cases, petitioners are solidarity liable to return the "net disallowed amount,"
[263]
 or the disallowed amount less the amounts not required to be returned. Applying Section 106 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, the officer who directed the release of the funds is primarily liable, while the accountable officer is secondarily liable. The accountable officer is relieved from liability if it is shown that the accountable officer "notified the superior officer in writing of the illegality of the payment, application, or disposition."
[264]
 
A review of the various Notices of Disallowances questioned in 
Escarez, Wycoco
, and these consolidated Petitions reveals that the earliest Notice of Disallowance was issued on January 7, 2010, disallowing the food and grocery incentives in 2008 of Regional Office No. IV.
If this Court considers the earliest Notice of Disallowance in 
Escarez
 as notice to all National Food Authority offices that there is something amiss in the grant of the food and grocery incentives, then all the approving officers in these Petitions may be held solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount. Nevertheless, since each Notice of Disallowance may contain facts peculiar to it, we reviewed all of the assailed Decisions and Notices of Disallowance in these consolidated Petitions.
IV
 
 
G.R. No. 236282 (Regional Office No. V, Albay Provincial Office, and Catanduanes Provincial Office)
 
The Notices of Disallowance for the 2010 and 2011 food and grocery incentives were issued only in 2012. When the food and grocery incentives were released, there had yet to be a notice. The Petition is partially granted. The officials and employees of these offices are liable to return what they received based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 236503 (Surigao Del Norte Provincial Office)
 
This Court notes that, as early as in its 2015 Annual Audit Report, the Commission on Audit has noted that the Surigao Del Norte Provincial Office had previously been issued a Notice of Disallowance dated September 10, 2010 for the 2009 food and grocery incentives.
[265]
 Thus, the disallowance made in 2011 was not the first; there was a previous disallowance of which the approving officers should have been aware. The approving and certifying officers are solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount. All payees must return the disallowed amount based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 237549 (Abra Provincial Office)
 
The Notice of Disallowance for the 2012 food and grocery incentives appears to be the first disallowance issued to NFA-Abra Provincial Office. The approving and certifying officers are exonerated from their solidary liability. Nonetheless, all recipients must return the disallowed amount based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 237550 (Northern Leyte Provincial Office)
 
Before the Notice of Disallowance for 2012 was issued, previous notices of disallowance were issued to the Northern Leyte Provincial Office.
[266]
 The approving and certifying officials are solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount; the recipients must return the disallowed amount based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 237551 (La Union Provincial Office)
 
The Notice of Disallowance for the 2012 food and grocery incentives appears to be the first disallowance issued to the La Union Provincial Office. The approving and certifying officers are exonerated from solidary liability. The recipients, however, must return the disallowed amount based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. Nos. 237552 and 237562-63 (Regional Office No. IV, Marinduque Provincial Office)
 
The Petitions involve Notices of Disallowance issued to Regional Office No. IV for 2012 and to the Marinduque Provincial Office for 2008, 2009, and 2010.
Escarez
 involved Notices of Disallowance for 2008 and 2009 for the Regional Office No. IV. Considering that it had previously received notices of disallowance, its approving and certifying officers are solidarily liable to return the net disallowed amount. The recipients are liable to return the amounts received for 2012 based on 
solutio indebiti
.
As for the Marinduque Provincial Office, three Notices of Disallowance were issued to its officialsâthe first and second, both dated March 2, 2010, disallowed the 2008 and 2009 incentives; the third, dated May 25, 2011, disallowed the 2010 incentives.
For the first two Notices of Disallowance, we excuse the officials held solidarily liable because there appears to be no prior disallowance then. For the third Notice of Disallowance, however, the approving and certifying officers must be held solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount because, by then, they would have already been aware of the previous disallowance. On both instances, nonetheless, the recipients must return the disallowed amount based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 237585 (Laguna Provincial Office)
 
The Notices of Disallowance for 2009
[267]
 and 2010
[268]
 are both dated July 24, 2011. Thus, when the food and grocery incentives were released, there was no previous disallowance to speak of. Thus, the approving and certifying officers are exonerated from solidary liability to return the net disallowed amounts. The recipients, based on 
solutio indebiti
, must return the benefits received. 
 
G.R. No. 237698 (Occidental Mindoro Provincial Office)
 
Prior to Notice of Disallowance No. 13-001-GOF-(12) disallowing the food and grocery incentives for 2012, the Occidental Mindoro Provincial Office received notices of disallowance for previous years' food and grocery incentives.
[269]
 Hence, the Notice of Disallowance questioned in this Petition was not the first disallowance given to the office. The approving and certifying officers should be held solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount, while the recipients should return the benefits received based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 237841 (Regional Office No. I)
 
The approving officer in this case was Santos, who is also a petitioner in G.R. No. 236282.
The assailed Decision in G.R. No. 236282 involve Notices of Disallowance that were issued in 2012 for Regional Office No. V, Masbate Provincial Office, and Catanduanes Provincial Office.
Here, in G.R. No. 237841, the Notice of Disallowance was issued in 2014 for Regional Office No. I.
While the Petitions involve different offices, the approving officer was the same person, Santos. He was already aware of the possible infirmity of the food and grocery incentives when a Notice of Disallowance was issued in 2012, yet he still approved the release of funds for the same benefit in 2014. The defense of good faith is clearly unavailing; as approving officer, he should be held solidarily liable with the other approving and certifying officers for the net disallowed amount, while the recipients should return the benefits received based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 240593 (Laguna Provincial Office)
 
The Laguna Provincial Office received a Notice of Disallowance in 2013, but it had previously been given Notices of Disallowance, which are now subject of G.R. Nos. 237585 and 252357. As the Commission on Audit aptly found, good faith was lacking because of these previous disallowances.
[270]
 The approving and certifying officers are held solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount. The recipients are liable to return the amounts received based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 240891 (Cagayan Provincial Office)
 
The records do not show any previous disallowance issued to the Cagayan Provincial Office. Thus, there is no solidary liability for the approving and certifying officers. However, 
solutio indebiti
 would apply to recipients, who must return the received benefits. 
 
G.R. No. 241717 (Regional Office No. VIII)
 
The Regional Office No. VIII received previous Notices of Disallowance.
[271]
 The approving and certifying officers are solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount. Based on 
solutio indebiti
, all recipients must return the amounts received. 
 
G.R. No. 249689 (Ilocos Norte Provincial Office; Ilocos Sur Provincial Office; Eastern Pangasinan Provincial Office; Western Pangasinan Provincial Office; Benguet Provincial Office; Kalinga Provincial Office; Batangas Provincial Office; and Southern Leyte Provincial Office)
 
There appears to be no previous disallowance issued to the Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Eastern Pangasinan, Western Pangasinan, Benguet, and Kalinga. The approving officials are exonerated from solidary liability for the disallowed amounts, but all recipients should return the amounts received based on 
solutio indebiti
.
We rule differently for the Batangas Provincial Office and Southern Leyte Provincial Office.
For the Batangas Provincial Office, Notice of Disallowance No. 2013-002(2012)BPO was addressed to Rebecca H. Andal. She is also the petitioner in 
Andal v. Commission on Audit
, docketed as G.R. No. 218334, which was consolidated with 
Escarez
. The facts of 
Andal
 narrate that the office had been issued a Notice of Disallowance for the food and grocery Incentive for the year 2009.
[272]
 Thus, Rebecca H. Andal was well aware of a previous disallowance for the same benefit given to the same office. There is no indication that she informed her superior of the previous disallowance. The defense of good faith cannot be availed of, and she is solidarily liable with the other approving and certifying officers for the net disallowed amount. All recipients are also liable to return the amounts received based on 
solutio indebiti
.
As for the Southern Leyte Provincial Office, it had previously been given a Notice of Disallowance for the food and grocery incentives in 2012.
[273]
 Hence, its approving and certifying officers can no longer avail of the defense of good faith, and they are solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount. The recipients should return the amounts received based on 
solutio indebiti
. 
 
G.R. No. 252355 (Isabela Provincial Office)
 
The Petition involves what appears to be the first Notice of Disallowance for the Isabela Provincial Office. Thus, the approving officials are absolved from solidary liability to return the net disallowed amount. Based on 
solutio indebiti
, however, all recipients of the food and grocery incentives, must return the amounts received. 
 
G.R. No. 252357 (Laguna Provincial Office, Quezon Provincial Office, and National Capital Region-South District Office)
 
The Petition involves disallowances issued to the Laguna Provincial Office, Quezon Provincial Office, and National Capital Region-South District Office. The Laguna Provincial Office received a Notice of Disallowance for 2011 dated July 24, 2012. At that time, it had already received the Notices of Disallowance subject of G.R. No. 237585. Hence, for this case, the defense of good faith can no longer be invoked, and the approving and certifying officers are held solidarily liable. The recipients must return the disallowed amount based on 
solutio indebiti
.
For the Quezon Provincial Office, the Notices of Disallowance for 2008, 2009, and 2011 were all issued consecutively from July 17, 2012 to July 19, 2012. Only then was the office notified of the impropriety of the food and grocery incentives. Thus, its approving and certifying officers are exonerated from solidary liability, but on account of 
solutio indebiti
, all recipients are still bound to return the amounts received.
The records do not show any previous disallowance issued against National Capital Region-South District Office. Hence, the concerned officials and employees are also in good faith, but again, based on 
solutio indebiti
, they have the duty to return the amounts received.

TOTAL
Amount Disallowed
24,445,000.00
 
The total amount disallowed in these consolidated petitions is P24,445,000.00.
We excused the approving and certifying officers from solidary liability where the facts of the case show that no previous disallowance was issued to the office concerned.
The same rule is applied for Petitions involving Notices of Disallowance for various years that were issued on the same date, or on dates close to each other that no reasonable notice of a previous disallowance could be ascertained.
We dismissed the Petitions where the approving or certifying officer was the same person, or where previous Notices of Disallowance had been issued. The solidary liability to return the net disallowed amount of the approving and certifying officer remains.
In all these Petitions, the rule on 
solutio indebiti
 applies and the recipients have the obligation to return the amounts received.
To prevent future disallowances, we remind public officials and employees of the fundamental principles stated in the Government Auditing Code:
[274]
SECTION 4. 
Fundamental Principles
. â Financial transactions and operations of any government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit:
(1) No money shall be paid out of any public treasury of depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.
(2) Government funds or property shall be spent or used solely for public purposes.
(3) Trust funds shall be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds received.
(4) Fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency.
(5) Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.
(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.
(7) All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.
(8) Generally accepted principles and practices of accounting as well as of sound management and fiscal administration shall be observed, provided that they do not contravene existing laws and regulations.
