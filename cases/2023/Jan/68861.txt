JUDGE JAIME B. SANTIAGO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ROMELITO G. FERNANDO, UTILITY WORKER I, BRANCH 18, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, [RTC], TAGAYTAY CITY, CAVITE, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




ROSARIO, J.:


This administrative matter arose from two Complaints initiated by Acting Presiding Judge Jaime B. Santiago (complainant judge) against Romelito G. Fernando (respondent) indorsed to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action.
The Antecedent Facts
Respondent was a Utility Worker I of Branch 18, Regional Trial Court of Tagaytay City, Cavite before being appointed by complainant judge as Clerk III in charge of civil cases in December 2014.
[1]
In a Complaint
[2]
 dated August 11, 2015, complainant judge charged respondent with Insubordination, Irregularity in the Performance of Duty, and Gross Neglect of Duty.
Complainant judge alleged that respondent failed to abide by his directives despite repeated admonishment and written warnings. In particular, respondent did not immediately refer to him the Formal Offer of Documentary Evidence (Formal Offer) in two (2) land registration cases, specifically, LRC No. TG-14-035 filed on October 10, 2014
[3]
 and LRC No. TG-14-060 filed on February 17, 2015,
[4]
 which prevented him from deciding these cases promptly. Instead, these pleadings were belatedly given to complainant judge on August 11, 2015.
In his Comment
[5]
 dated November 9, 2015, respondent stated that the lapses he committed, if any, were unintentional and were due to his preoccupation with his numerous daily tasks. As to the purported delay in transmitting the Formal Offer of the cases, respondent faulted his coÂ­ employees. With regard to LRC No. TG-14-035, he claimed that it was Remy Ligsa who was tasked to attach the Formal Offer to the case folder. As regards LRC No. TG-14-060, respondent averred that it was only on February 16, 2015 that he was instructed by complainant judge to give him the case folder. Moreover, he was unable to transmit the same immediately because it was only given to him by Madonna Cunanan on May 18, 2015.
Further, in a Supplemental Complaint
[6]
 dated October 5, 2015, complainant judge charged respondent with Continued Irregularities, Gross Incompetence, and Gross Misconduct.
Complainant judge narrated that on September 18, 2015, Mrs. Lolita Borja arrived at court shouting and looking for respondent. She claimed that on May 22, 2015, respondent asked for P40,000.00 to facilitate the bail of her son, Eric Borja 
y
 Guevana, who was detained for violation of Section 11
[7]
 of Republic Act No. 9165
[8]
 in Criminal Case No. TG-15-1030.
[9]
 Despite payment of the said amount, her son remained in jail. Further, the complainant judge claimed that during the January 2014 semestral inventory, he directed all staff to surrender all records in their possession. When he compared the docket with the records on hand, he noted that several criminal case records already submitted for decision/resolution were unaccounted for. He ordered his staff to search the entire office, including respondent's work area, where they discovered 51 criminal case folders and one (1) Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court case in his possession.
[10]
 In addition, on February 14, 2014, he noticed another three (3) criminal case folders in respondent's custody. When confronted, respondent claimed that Sheriff Laydabell G. Pijana instructed him to mail the orders to the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor and the Public Attorney's Office lawyer.
[11]
 Complainant judge issued Sheriff Laydabell G. Pijana and respondent a Memorandum
[12]
 directing them to explain,
[13]
 both of them categorically denied each other's claims and pointed to each other as the culprit.
[14]
 Finally, when petitioners in LRC-No. TG-14-078 and LRC No. TG-13-1891 followed up The status of their cases, their corresponding records were nowhere to be found. This prompted complainant judge to order all his staff to search for the records. The missing case records were found inside respondent's steel drawer.
[15]
In its 1
st
 Indorsement
[16]
 dated November 3, 2015, the OCA directed respondent to file a Comment to the Supplemental Complaint within ten (10) days from notice. Respondent requested for an additional five (5) days or until March 29, 2016 to submit his Comment,
[17]
 citing health reasons. The OCA, in turn, granted respondent's request.
[18]
 Records reveal that respondent went on Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL) without filing the required Comment.
In its 1
st
 Tracer
[19]
 dated January 16, 2017, the OCA reiterated its directive for respondent to file a Comment within five (5) days of receipt with a final warning that the administrative matter will be submitted to the Court without his Comment.
In a Memorandum
[20]
 dated March 21, 2017, complainant judge reported that as per the Official Attendance Logbook of the Court, respondent last logged in on January 22, 2016 and thereafter, had been AWOL.
In a Resolution dated November 29, 2017, respondent's name was stricken from the rolls.
[21]
Report and Recommendation by the OCA
In a Memorandum
[22]
 dated April 25, 2018, the OCA recommended the following:
the instant administrative complaint against respondent Romelito G. Fernando, Utility Worker I, Branch 18, Regional Trial Court, Tagaytay City, be 
RE-DOCKETED
 as a regular administrative matter; and
respondent Fernando be found 
GUILTY
 of Gross Insubordination and Grave Misconduct and be ordered 
DISMISSED
 from the service, but considering that he has been dropped from the rolls effective 29 November 2017 for having been on absence without official leave (AWOL), that respondent Fernando be imposed instead the accessory penalties of 
FORFEITURE
 of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, and 
PERPETUAL DISQUALIFICATION
 from reÂ­-employment in any government instrumentality including government-Â­owned and controlled corporations.
[23]
As to the charge of Gross Insubordination, the OCA held that respondent was remiss in his duty to timely present the case folders to complainant judge, which caused delay in the resolution of the cases. Considering that respondent failed to file his Comment to the Supplemental Complaint, the charge of withholding the 51 criminal case folders found in respondent's work area and the records for LRC No. TG-14-078 and LRC No. TG-13-1891 found in his steel drawer were uncontested. The OCA ruled that the foregoing resulted from respondent's disobedience to established court procedure which was tantamount to Gross Insubordination, a grave offense, punishable under Section 50(B) (9), Rule 10 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service punishable by suspension of six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense.
[24]
Further; the OCA found respondent liable for Grave Misconduct for receiving money from a litigant. Despite the opportunity to refute this charge and challenge the authenticity of his signature affixed to a handwritten note stating that he received P40,000.00, respondent did not file a Comment which the OCA treated as an admission by silence.
[25]
 For reference, the said handwritten note reads:
May 12, 2015
Received the amount of thirty-five thousand (P35,000.00) for safekeeping.
May 22, 2015 plus P5,000.00 (P40,000.00).
Tagaytay City, May 22, 2015.

Rommel Fernando
[26]
As to the penalty, the charges of Gross Insubordination and Grave Misconduct are sanctioned with the penalty of dismissal from service. Considering, however, that respondent has been dropped from the rolls, the OCA recommended the imposition of accessory penalties of forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from reÂ­employment in any government instrumentality, including governmentÂ­-owned and controlled corporations.
[27]
The Issue
The issue for resolution is whether respondent can be held administratively liable for Gross Insubordination and Grave Misconduct.
The Court's Ruling
Preliminary Matters
At the onset, it bears pointing out that the applicable rule in the present case is A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC dated February 22, 2022, entitled "
Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court
" (Revised Rule 140), which became effective on April 4, 2022. Revised Rule 140 was envisioned to be a disciplinary framework for the entire Judiciary that is wholly independent from the Civil Service Rules and uniformly applicable to all cases, regardless of when the infractions are committed.
[28]
Further, respondent's absence without leave during the pendency of the administrative case against him will not prevent the Court from determining his liability and meting the proper penalty therefor. The filing of an administrative case is predicated on the holding of a position or office in government service and once jurisdiction has attached, the same is not lost by the mere fact that the public official or employee was no longer in office during the pendency of the case.
[29]
 Thus, what is essential is that the administrative case was instituted while the court officer or employee was still in government service, which obtains in this case. Similarly, respondent's failure to file a Comment to the Supplemental Complaint will not hinder this Court from imposing the proper sanction for his infractions, if any.
[30]
Substantive Matters
After a careful review of the records of the case, the Court adopts the findings of the OCA, but with modifications. In addition to the charges of Gross Insubordination and Grave Misconduct, the Court finds that respondent should be guilty of an additional count of Gross Insubordination for failure to file his Comment despite notice. Consequently, the Court modifies the penalty recommended by the OCA such that in addition to the forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from reÂ­employment in any government instrumentality, including government-Â­owned and controlled corporations which is imposed 
in lieu
 of dismissal from service, the Court deems it proper to impose a fine in the amount of P300,000.00, as authorized under Section 17(1) (c) in relation to Section 18 (b) of Revised Rule 140.
We expound.
Gross Insubordination is defined as the "inexplicable and unjustified refusal to obey some order that a superior is entitled to give and have obeyed, and imports a willful or intentional disregard of the lawful and reasonable instructions of the superior."
[31]
 It is manifested by a "brazen disrespect for and defiance towards one's superiors."
[32]
 Based on the facts obtaining in this case, the Court finds that two (2) separate charges for Gross Insubordination arise: 
first
, as correctly pointed out by OCA, with respect to respondent's conduct towards complainant judge, his superior and 
second
, for failure to submit Comment despite repeated notice.
Aside from being mindful of their dockets, judges are tasked to keep a watchful eye on the level of performance and conduct of the court personnel under their immediate supervision who are primarily employed to aid in the administration of justice.
[33]
 Having discovered irregularities occurring in his court, it was incumbent upon complainant judge to eliminate these irregularities; otherwise, he would be grossly negligent in the performance of his duties. Thus, complainant judge was acting well-within his authority in requiring respondent to transmit pleadings and other court records without any unnecessary delay in line with court policy.
Respondent's repeated disobedience to complainant judge's directives cannot simply be discounted. While there was insufficient evidence to attribute any corruption or clear showing of wrongdoing for respondent's unexplained withholding of case records and pleadings, the Court must still penalize respondent as cases should be decided promptly and expeditiously under the time-honored precept that justice delayed is justice denied. By repeatedly disregarding complainant judge's directives to transmit court documents in a timely manner, the seasonable disposition of cases was undoubtedly affected.
Further, respondents in administrative complaints should comment on all accusations or allegations against them in the administrative complaints because it is their duty to preserve the integrity of the judiciary.
[34]
 It is undisputed that despite receipt of OCA's 1st Indorsement dated November 3, 2015 directing him to file a Comment to the Supplemental Complaint, respondent failed to do so. It bears pointing out that respondent even requested an extension which notably, the OCA granted; and yet, respondent went on AWOL without submitting his Comment. Such conduct manifests a clear and willful disrespect for the lawful orders of the OCA,
[35]
 through whom at the time pending the investigation, the Court exercised supervision over all lower courts and personnel.
[36]
 Otherwise stated, respondent's willful refusal to comply with the directives of the OCA constituted a defiance of the lawful orders of no less than the Court itself.
Considering the severity of the charges against respondent in the Supplemental Complaint, it is contrary to logic and human experience that he opted to remain silent if these allegations against him were untrue. In line with recent jurisprudence,
[37]
 respondent has left the Court with no alternative but to deduce his implicit admission of the charges against him. The Court, in 
Yoshimura v. Panagsagan
,
[38]
 explains:
The natural instinct of man impels him to resist an unfounded claim or imputation and defend himself.
 It is totally against our human nature to just remain reticent and say nothing in the face of false accusations. 
Silence in such cases is almost always construed as implied admission of the truth thereof.
 Consequently, we are left with no choice but to deduce his implicit admission of the charges levelled against him. 
Qui tacet consentire videtur
. Silence gives consent.
[39]
 (Underscoring supplied).
Thus, as it stands, the charges of withholding numerous criminal case records and receiving money from a litigant, remain undisputed.
Lastly, the Court sustains the OCA's conclusion finding respondent liable for Grave Misconduct.
Grave Misconduct is defined as "a serious transgression of some established and definite rule of action (such as unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer or employee) that tends to threaten the very existence of the system of administration of justice an official or employee serves."
[40]
 It may manifest itself in corruption, or in other similar acts, done with the clear intent to violate the law or in flagrant disregard of established rules.
[41]
 Moreover, Section 2, Canon I of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel
[42]
 specifically prohibits all court employees from soliciting or accepting any gift, favor or benefit based on any or explicit understanding that such gift, favor or benefit shall influence their official actions.
In several cases,
[43]
 this Court has ruled that a court personnel's act of soliciting or receiving money from litigants constitutes Grave Misconduct. Corruption as an element of grave misconduct in the instant case consisted in respondent's acts of unlawfully or wrongfully using his position or character of his office to procure some benefit for himself or for another, contrary to the rights of others.
[44]
 In the instant case, respondent neither had color of authority nor legal basis to collect P40,000.00 from Mrs. Lolita Borja. Grave Misconduct is the same as Gross Misconduct.
[45]
 Hence, to use the terminology employed under Revised Rule 140, it is apparent that respondent's conduct was tantamount to Gross Misconduct constituting a violation of the Code of Conduct for Personnel as penalized under Section 14 (a).
It bears stressing, however, that respondent's culpability for receiving money from a party-litigant is not solely-based on his failure to deny the accusations against him. Aside from the handwritten note presented by Mrs. Lolita Borja signed by respondent himself confirming receipt of P40,000.00 which stands uncontroverted, the Court gives credence to the statements taken from Mr. Cenon Borja and Mrs. Lolita Borja (spouses Borja) during the investigation conducted by complainant judge. Attached to the records of this case is the transcript
[46]
 of the investigation where the spouses Borja detailed how they approached respondent for assistance regarding the processing of the bail of their son on May 12, 2015 and how he assured them that he would take care of everything, including the processing of the insurance, for P40,000.00. Even the fact that spouses Borja were the ones who approached respondent for assistance does not exculpate him from liability. The Court is emphatic that the sole act of receiving money from litigants, whatever the reason may be, is antithesis to being a court employee.
[47]
 Thus, there is no defense in receiving money from party-litigants and act itself makes court employees guilty of Grave Misconduct.
[48]
Proper Penalties
In view of the foregoing, respondent is found liable of two (2) counts of Gross Insubordination and one (1) count of Grave Misconduct or presently designated as Gross Misconduct constituting a violation of the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel. Here, respondent is guilty of three (3) separate offenses with each offense classified as a serious charge under Section 14
[49]
 of Revised Rule 140. The sanctions for offenses classified as serious charges are:
SECTION 17. 
Sanctions
. â 
 
(1)
If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:
(a)
 Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. 
Provided, however
, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;
(b)
Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one (1) year; or
(c)
 fine of more than [P]100,000.00 but not exceeding [P]200,000.00.
In addition, Section 21 of Revised Rule 140 delineates the rule with regard to the imposition of penalties when a respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, as in this case, 
to wit
:
SECTION 21. 
Penalty for Multiple Offenses
. - 
If the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense.
 Should the aggregate of the imposed penalties exceed five (5) years of suspension or [P]1,000,000.00 in fines, the respondent may, in the discretion of the Supreme Court, be meted with the penalty of dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as may be determined, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. 
Provided, however
, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits.
On the other hand, if a single act/omission constitutes more than one offense, the respondent shall still be found liable for all such offenses, but shall, nonetheless, only be meted with appropriate penalty for the most serious offense. (Underscoring supplied.)
Thus, the Court imposes upon the respondent a separate penalty for each of the three (3) charges. However, considering that respondent has been dropped from the rolls for being AWOL as of November 29, 2017, the penalty of dismissal from service can no longer be imposed. Section 18 of Revised Rule 140 addresses this circumstance by providing for alternative penalties, thus:
SECTION 18. 
Penalty in Lieu of Dismissal on Account of Supervening Resignation, Retirement, or other Modes of Separation of Service
. â If the respondent is found liable for an offense which merits the imposition of the penalty of dismissal from service but the same can no longer be imposed due to the respondent's supervening resignation, retirement, or other modes of separation from service except death, he or she may be meted with the following penalties in lieu of dismissal:
(a) Forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office; including government-owned or -controlled corporations. 
Provided
, however that the forfeiture of benefit shall in no case include accrued leave credits; 
and/or
(b) Fine as stated in Section 17(l)(c) of this Rule. (Underscoring supplied).
Notably, the use of "and/or" under Section 18 authorizes the imposition of either or both the penalties enumerated therein. To recall, the OCA recommended that respondent be penalized with Section 18 (a) for one (1) charge of Gross Insubordination and one (1) charge of Gross Misconduct. Under the attendant circumstances, however, the Court deems it proper to modify OCA's recommendation such that, the 
first charge
 of Gross Insubordination shall be penalized under Section 18(a), the 
second charge
 of Gross Insubordination shall be penalized with a fine of P150,000.00 and 
third charge
 of Gross Misconduct shall be penalized with a fine of P150,000.00. Finally, pursuant to Section 22
[50]
 of Revised Rule 140, respondent shall pay the fine within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time this Resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits, due to the respondent.
Time and again, the Court has always reminded all employees of the Judiciary, from judges to the most junior clerks, to conduct themselves in a manner exemplifying integrity, honesty and uprightness.
[51]
 Accordingly, their conduct must be guided by strict propriety and decorum at all times in order to merit and maintain the public's respect for, and trust, in the Judiciary.
[52]
 There is no place in the judiciary for those who cannot meet the exacting standards of judicial conduct and integrity.
WHEREFORE
, the Court finds respondent Romelito G. Fernando 
GUILTY
 of two (2) counts of GROSS INSUBORDINATION and one (1) count of GROSS MISCONDUCT constituting a violation of the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel. Respondent Romelito G. Fernando is meted the penalty, under Section 18(a) of the Revised Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, of forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. He is also ordered to pay a 
FINE
 in the aggregate amount of P300,000.00 within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time this Resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount shall be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits due to respondent. Finally, respondent Romelito G. Fernando is ordered to 
RETURN
 to Mrs. Lolita Borja the amount of P40,000.00, with interest rate at 6% per annum from finality of this Resolution until full payment.

SECTION 22. 
Payment of Fines
. - When the penalty imposed is a fine, the respondent shall pay it within a period not exceeding three (3) months from the time the decision or resolution is promulgated. If unpaid, such amount may be deducted from the salaries and benefits, including accrued leave credits, due to the respondent.
