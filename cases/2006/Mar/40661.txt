In the course of the financial audit conducted on the books of account of Clerk of Court Laura D. Delantar of the Municipal Trial Court of Leyte, Leyte, covering the period November 11, 1989 up to September 30, 2004, the audit team noted several deficiencies, to wit:  (a) entries in the official receipts pertaining to collections for the solemnization and filing fees were tampered; (b)  entries in the duplicate and triplicate copies of the official receipts were written in ink in violation of Circular No. 22-94 which requires that the duplicate and triplicate copies should be carbon reproduction; (c) the official receipts were not properly maintained; (d) entries in the official receipts were illegible and incomplete; (e) the collections for the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) and General Fund (GF) were erroneously recorded; (f) the cashbooks were not properly maintained; (g) some collections were not recorded in the cash book; (h)  the monthly reports were not filed; (i)  the remittances of collections were delayed; (j) the collections for the Fiduciary Fund (FF) were not deposited in the savings account; and (k) the bail bond for Case No. 3692 has no collection.

In a Memorandum dated January 28, 2005, Judge Antonio A. Abilar was directed to investigate and submit his report and recommendation; to designate the personnel who will handle the collections; and to monitor the handling of the judiciary funds.
Judge Abilar required Delantar to comment and set the reception of evidence on March 7, 2005; however, before the scheduled hearing, Delantar submitted her comment where she unqualifiedly admitted the findings of the audit team.  Thereafter, Judge Abilar proceeded with the examination of documents to determine the extent of Delantar's liabilities and found thus:

The investigating judge found Delantar guilty of gross neglect of duty and dishonesty and recommended that she be dismissed from the service or, in the alternative, she should be allowed to retire considering her admission of the irregularities, her willingness to restitute the misappropriated funds, and her 25 years of service in the judiciary.
The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), however, opined that Delantar's partial restitution of the shortages and her admission are not enough to overcome the gravity of her infractions spanning a long period of time.  The OCA thus recommended:
to docket the audit report as a regular administrative complaint against Delantar;
to immediately suspend Delantar from office while undergoing investigation;
to dismiss Delantar from the service effective immediately with forfeiture of retirement benefits except accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities including government-owned and controlled corporations;
to withhold the accrued leave credits and apply the same to the final shortages established for Judiciary Development Fund and Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund amounting to P29,229.75 and P7,027.00, respectively, if Delantar fails to restitute the said shortage per directive of this Office;
to direct the Legal Office, OCA to file the appropriate criminal charges against Delantar; and
to issue a Hold Departure Order against Delantar.
We agree with the findings and recommendation of the OCA.
Public office is a public trust.  Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.  Those charged with the dispensation of justice, from the justices and judges to the lowliest clerks, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.  Not only must their conduct at all times be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, it must be beyond suspicion.
[1]
No position demands greater moral righteousness and uprightness from the occupant than does the judicial office.  The safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly administration of justice and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the Circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds.  The failure to remit the funds in due time constitutes gross dishonesty and gross misconduct which cannot be countenanced by the Court for they diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary.  The act of misappropriating judiciary funds constitutes dishonesty and grave misconduct which are grave offenses punishable by dismissal even if committed for the first time.
[2]
Clerks of court perform delicate functions as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises.  As such, they are also the court's treasurers, accountants, guards and physical plant managers.  Hence, they are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of those funds or property.
[3]
Delantar took advantage of her position as branch clerk of court and misappropriated the collections for the judiciary funds.  The infractions, i.e., tampering of the official receipts; tampering of the cash book; failure to record and remit collections;  and failure to file monthly reports, were committed not by mere inadvertence but with conscious and deliberate efforts which evince a malicious and immoral propensity.  Her unqualified admission and partial restitution could not, therefore, be considered as indicia of good faith; her acts of misappropriating the judiciary funds and altering the entries are inconsistent with good faith.
We note that after partial restitutions by Delantar, the shortage now only amounts to P29,229.75 and P7,027.00 representing the misappropriated Judiciary Development Fund and Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund.  This sum may be disproportionate vis-a-vis the imposable penalty of dismissal; however, the penalty is not contingent on the amount misappropriated, but is imposed because there was misappropriation of government funds.  For those who have fallen short of their accountabilities, we have not hesitated to impose the ultimate penalty.  This Court had never and will never tolerate nor condone any conduct which would violate the norms of public accountability, and diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the justice system.
