On receipt of the same Report, Senior Deputy Court Administrator Zenaida N. ElepaÃ±o issued a Memorandum
[3]
 dated September 2, 2004 directing Judge Aguirre, Jr. to:
a) EXPLAIN the causes of the delay in deciding the following cases within the mandatory period to decide, to wit: Criminal Case Nos. 1230, 1152 and Civil Case Nos. 899, 900 and 877; DECIDE the same within 30 days from notice and submit to the Court copies of the decisions.
b) INFORM the Court whether the following cases submitted for decision but still within the mandatory period to decide at the time of audit, have already been decided, namely: Civil Case Nos. 894 and 888 and submit copies of the decision.
c) EXPLAIN the causes of the delay in resolving within the mandatory period the pending incidents/motions in the following cases, to wit: Civil Case Nos. 847, 852 and SP 242; RESOLVE the same within 15 days from notice and submit copies of the Orders.
d) INFORM the Court whether the pending motions/incidents in following cases but still within the mandatory period to resolve, have already been resolved, namely: Criminal Case No. 1634 and Civil Case Nos. 921, 902, 886, SP 51 and SP 105 and submit to the Court copies of the Orders.
e) EXPLAIN why the following cases have not been acted upon for a considerable length of time, to wit: Criminal Case No. 1556 and Civil Case Nos. 873, 830, 917, 883, 794, SP 294, SP 323, SP 243, SP 235, SP 125, SP 88, SP 90, SP 126, SP 108 and SP 8; IMMEDIATELY  act on the said cases and submit to the Court copies of the action taken thereon.
f) STRICTLY COMPLY with OCA Circular No. 12-2002 as amended by OCA Circular No. 28-2003 by submitting to the Court the Minutes of the Judicial Service Team Meeting.
In compliance with the above, Judge Aguirre submitted his explanations, one dated September 29, 2004
[4]
 
and the other dated October 29, 2004.
[5]
 Admittedly, out of the eight (8) cases not yet decided beyond the period prescribed by law, only seven (7) cases were resolved.  Respondent judge blamed the parties' non-submission of memoranda for his failure to decide the said cases within the 90-day period therefor.  He explained that Civil Case No. 899 was not decided on time, because of plaintiff-appellee's manifestation therein that he will file a memorandum which was not yet filed at the time of audit.  As to paragraphs (b) and (d), he immediately took appropriate action and decided the six (6) cases listed in the said paragraphs.  As directed, he also submitted the copies of the minutes of the meeting of the judicial service team for the months of January to August 2004 and the Court Performance Inventories and Court Action Plans for the months of March and June 2004.

  Judge Aguirre also gave the following explanations and/or actions taken in the following cases:

Judge Aguirre, Jr. likewise justified his failure to decide and/or resolve/take further action on some cases on account of  his court's heavy caseload it being a heinous crimes court and that some cases involve difficult and intricate issues which need further study before rendering his decisions thereon.
Finding  Judge  Aguirre's  explanations  unsatisfactory, the OCA on April 4, 2005, recommended to the Court that the audit team's  report be docketed as a regular administrative matter against Judge Aguirre, Jr. for gross inefficiency and  that he be fined in the amount of P20,000.00, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
After a careful evaluation of the records, the Court agrees with the  finding of the OCA that Judge Aguirre, Jr.'s explanations for his failure to act promptly and decide the eight (8) cases
[7]
 within the time prescribed by law are insufficient.
 
Section 15 (1), Article VIII, of the Constitution provides:
SEC. 15. (1) All cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.
To implement the foregoing constitutional mandate, Rule 1.02, Canon 1 and Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct respectively provide:
Rule 1.02. â A judge should administer justice impartially and without delay.
Rule 3.05. â A judge shall dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods.
Respondent judge cannot justify his delay in deciding the aforementioned eight (8)
[8]
 cases on the excuse that he was still awaiting the parties' memoranda.  The Court issued Administrative Circular No. 28 on July 3, 1989 to make clear to all judges that a case is considered submitted for decision upon the admission of the parties' evidence at the termination of the trial.  However, should the court require or allow the submission of memoranda, the case is considered submitted for decision upon the filing of the last memorandum or the expiration of the period therefor, whichever is earlier, and while a court may grant an extension of time to file memorandum, it cannot extend the ninety-day (90)  period within which to decide.  In 
Salvador vs. Salamanca,
[9]
 this Court held:
...judges should decide cases even if the parties failed to submit memoranda within the given periods.Non-submission of memoranda is not a justification for failure to decide cases. The filing of memoranda is not a part of the trial nor is the memorandum itself an essential, much less indispensable pleading before a case may be submitted for decision. As it is merely intended to aid the court in the rendition of the decision in accordance with law and evidence â which even in its absence the court can do on the basis of the judge's personal notes and the records of the case â non-submission thereof has invariably been considered a waiver of the privilege.
Judge Aguirre, Jr. would rely on his court's heavy caseload it being a heinous crimes court to justify the delay in the disposition of cases in his sala.  The Court reiterates that judges, when burdened with heavy caseloads which prevent them from disposing their cases within the reglementary period, may ask for additional time.  Here, Judge Aguirre never asked for additional time.  The presumption then is that he is not burdened with caseloads.
The Court has consistently impressed upon judges the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously, on the principle that justice delayed is justice denied. Delay in the disposition of cases erodes the faith and confidence of the people in the judiciary, lowers its standards and brings it into disrepute. Hence, judges are enjoined to decide cases with dispatch.  Their failure to do so constitutes gross inefficiency and warrants the imposition of administrative sanction on them.
[10]
The Court adopts the recommendation of the OCA to impose a fine of P20,000.00 on the respondent judge.
Under Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC dated 11 September 2001, undue delay in rendering a decision or order is categorized as less serious charge with the following sanctions: (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months; or (b) a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00. 
The Court notes that this is not the first time that an administrative  case  was  filed  against  Judge Aguirre, Jr. for delay in  deciding a case.  In Administrative Case No. RTJ-01-1624 (
Request For Assistance Relative To Special Proceedings No. 28 Pending At Regional Trial Court Of Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, Branch  55,  Presided  By  Judge  Jose Y. Aguirre, Jr.
) promulgated on March 26, 2001,  Judge  Aguirre, Jr.  was  fined by the Court in the  amount of P2,000.00 for failure to timely resolve two pending incidents in Special Proceedings No. 28 then pending before his court.
WHEREFORE
, Judge Jose Y. AGUIRRE, JR. is found administratively liable for 
GROSS INEFFICIENCY
 for delay in the disposition of cases  and  is  hereby  
FINED i
n the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos  (P20,000.00),  which  amount shall be deducted from whatever retirement benefits due him. Let copy of this resolution be 
FORWARDED
  to  the  Office  of  the  Court  Administrator  so that the remaining benefits due the respondent judge are promptly released, unless there exists another lawful cause for withholding the same.
SO ORDERED.
