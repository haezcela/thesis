[ G.R. NO. 165038, November 29, 2006 ]


HEIRS OF EMILIO R. DOMINGO AND FELICIDAD CORNEJO, NAMELY: MARIO DOMINGO, AVELINO DOMINGO,  BASILISA VICENCIO, ALEJANDRO DOMINGO, LEONILA CABREZA, ENGRACIA VELASCO, MARIA LUZ DOMINGO  PETITIONERS, VS. THE HEIRS OF CLARITA D. MARTIN, NAMELY: CESAR, ADRIAN, EDNA, NOEL, RONALD AND ZENAIDA, ALL SURNAMED MARTIN. RESPONDENTS. 
 D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


The spouses Emilio R. Domingo and Felicidad Cornejo were the owners of a parcel of land, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 231 (OCT No. 231), known as Lot 1769
[1]
 (the lot).  After they and their children were killed during World War II, intestate estate proceedings, docketed as  Special Case No. 109-R, were filed before the then Court of First Instance of Davao City.
In the meantime, the lot was subdivided into two, Lot 1769-A and Lot 1769-B.  
Lot 1769-B
 
was
 
awarded
 
to
 
the
 
heirs
 
of
 
Emilio
 
Domingo
: his siblings Arturo Domingo, Manuel Domingo, Basilisa Vicencio, and Maria Domingo.  
Lot
 
1769-A
 
was
 
awarded to
 
the
 
heirs
 
of
 
Emilio's
 
wife
 
Felicidad
 
Cornejo
: her siblings Joaquin Cornejo, Dominga Bernabe, Nicanor Cornejo, Francisco Cornejo, Benedicto Cornejo, Maximo Cornejo, Ernesto Cornejo, and Fernando Cornejo.
Herein petitioners-heirs of Emilio Domingo's siblings, claiming that the heirs of Felicidad Cornejo, represented by Emilio Bernabe, sold Lot 1769-A to them in a transaction represented by Arturo Domingo, filed a complaint "for judicial settlement of estate with damages and attorney's fees,"
[2]
 docketed as Civil Case No. 25,170-97 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Davao City, against the heirs-children of Enrique and Clarita Martin who claimed that Lot 1769-A was sold to their parents from the heirs of Felicidad Cornejo.
[3]
Branch 8 of the Davao RTC held in favor of herein petitioners, it finding that "
the
 
share of
 
the
 
Cornejos
 . . . have been 
sold
 
to
 
Arturo
 
Domingo
, father of the plaintiffs and grandfather of the defendants."
The Court of Appeals, by Decision
[4]
 of February 13, 2004, reversed the trial court's decision upon a finding that the Domingo heirs-herein petitioners failed to establish their claim to Lot 1769-A by preponderance of evidence and thus declared
 the heirs of the spouses ENRIQUE and CLARITA Martin to be "
the
 
exclusive
 
co-owners
 
of the
 
share
 
pertaining
 
to
 
FELICIDAD
 
Cornejo-Domingo,
 
or
 
Lot
 
No.
 
1769-A
."
Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration
[5]
 of the Court of Appeals decision having been denied,
[6]
 they filed the present Petition for Review on Certiorari.
[7]
The petition is devoid of merit.
Indeed, petitioners failed to prove their claim to Lot 1769-A by preponderance of evidence.  Petitioners' Exhibit "A"âSeptember 21, 1964 receipt of payment
[8]
 presented to show that Arturo Domingo paid the purchase price of a "
lupa sa Lapanday sapagkat iyon ay mana rin namin
"
[9]
 could refer to any parcel of land in Lapanday.   Petitioners' claim, without  more, that "
lupa sa Lapanday
" was understood to refer to the lot covered by Lot 1769-A
[10]
 does not persuade.
Petitioners' Exhibit "B,"
[11]
 a signed agreement dated September 16, 1964 between Emilio Bernabe, as alleged representative of Felicidad Cornejo, and Arturo Domingo, as representative of Emilio Domingo reading:
KAMI, na nakalagda sa mababa ay nagpapatunay na sa paghahati ng isang lagay na tirikan ng bahay na pagaari ng mga yumaong EMILIO  DOMINGO at FELICIDAD CORNEJO, ay ang mga tagapagmana sa magkabila ay 
nagkasundo
 
at
 
sapamamagitan
 [
sic
] 
nito'y
 
nagkakasundo
 
na ang Lote Blg. 47-B-1 ay para sa mga tagapagmana ni EMILIO DOMINGO at ang Lote Blg. 47B-2 ay para sa mga tagapagmana ni FELICIDAD CORNEJO.
Nilagdaan, ngayon, ika 16 ng Septiembre, 1964, dito Lugsod ng Dabaw, Pilipinas.
[12]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),
does not prove that Lot No. 1769-A was being agreed upon as going to the heirs of Emilio Domingo.
Petitioners' Exhibit "C," the January ___ [
sic
] 1997
[13]
 Special Power of Attorney (SPA) purportedly executed by the heirs of Arturo R. Domingo and Maria T. Domingo including the now deceased Clarita D. Martin, predecessor-in-interest of respondents, naming "their brother and co-heir" herein petitioner Alejandro Domingo as their attorney-in-fact
x x x x
To investigate, find and recover for us whatever inheritance we are entitled to from our deceased parents mentioned above, whatever real of [
sic
] personal properties or whatever kind of inheritance, legacies or bequests we are entitled to;  more specifically our right and correct share from the parcel of land located in Mandug, City of Davao, particularly consisting of 21 hectares, 82 ares and 45 centares, 
covered
 
by
 
Oct
 
No.
P-231
 of the Register of Deeds of Davao City, still registered in the name of Emilio Domingo, but the ownership of which was 
transferred
 
absolutely
to
 
our
 
father,
 
Arturo
 
R.
 
Domingo
 during their lifetimes;
x x x x
[14]
  (Underscoring supplied)
does not prove their cause.  For even if Lot No. 1769-A formed part of the property "ownership of which was transferred absolutely to . . .  Arturo R. Domingo," the claim of transfer of ownership thereof is self-serving and hearsay.
Besides, the following exchange during the re-cross-examination of petitioner Alejandro Domingo casts doubt on the authenticity of the said Special Power of Attorney:
ATTY. MADRAZO:
Q:  Now, you claimed that this was signed by Clarita Martin and 
it was supposedly signed before Atty. Honesto Cabarroguis 
sometime
 
in
 
the
 
13
th
 
day
 
of
 
January,
 
1997
,
 can you affirm this fact that your sister appeared before Atty. Cabarroguis?
[ALEJANDRO DOMINGO] A: 
 Yes, in fact there were four of them who appeared before Atty. Cabarroguis, you can even subpoena attorney.
Q:  Do you know that 
sometime
 
in
 
January
 
13,
 
1997,
 
Clarita
 
Martin
 
was
 
in Manila
 
because
 
she
 
was
 
suffering
 
from
 
mild
 
stroke
?
A:  
Yes,
 
she
 
was
 
in
 
Manila
 
January
 
13,
 
but
 
she
 
left
 
for
 
Manila
 
January
 
14
 
[sic]
 
after
 
signing
.
[15]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
As for the tax declarations and receipts-Exhibits "M"â"O"
[16]
   presented by petitioners to prove their ownership of Lot No. 1769-A,
[17]
 these are not conclusive evidence of ownership.
[18]
On the other hand, the decision rendered by the then Court of First Instance of Davao granting the petition in Misc. Case No. 4100, "IN RE:  PETITION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF TITLE IN LIEU OF LOST ONE,"  filed by Enrique Martin, the father of herein respondents, declaring, among other things, that
Petitioner
 
[Enrique
 
Martin]
 
is
 
the
 
vendee
 
of a
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
land
 
registered
 
in
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
Emilio
 
Domingo
 
married
 
to
 
Felicidad
 
Cornejo
, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-231.
The 
evidence presented
 by the petitioner discloses that on September [illegible], 1964, 
he
 
bought
 
a
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
land
 
covered
 
by
 
the
 
aforesaid
 
certificate
 
of title
 
from
 
the
 
Heirs
 
of
 
Cornejo
 
(
Exhibit
 
B
).
x x x  
No
 
opposition
 
to
 
the
 
herein
 
petition
 
has
 
been
 
filed
 
nor
 
registered
 
despite
 
the
 
notice
 
by
 
publication
 
to
 
all
 
concerned
. . .
[19]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),
lends support to respondents' claim.
While the decision in Misc. Case No. 4100 does not constitute 
res judicata
 to the present case, there being no identity in causes of action,  it is settled that "a judgment is conclusive as to the facts admitted by the pleadings or assumed by the decision, where they were essential to the judgment, and were such that the judgment could not legally have been rendered without them."
[20]
 The finding in Misc. Case No. 4100 was essential to the judgment since a petition for reconstitution may be filed only by the registered owner, his assigns, or any person who has an interest in the property.
[21]
Not only have respondents proved their predecessors' title.  By presenting the decision
[22]
 in Special Case No. 109-R (the above-mentioned intestate estate proceedings), and the Subdivision Plan of Lot-1769,
[23]
 both of which identify Lot No. 1769-A as the portion of OCT-231 allotted to the Cornejo heirs,
[24]
 they have also identified the lot they are claiming as Lot No. 1769-A.
In fine, respondents have proven their claim by a preponderance of evidence.
WHEREFORE, 
the petition is 
DENIED
 and the questioned Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated February 13, 2004 and July 13, 2004, respectively, are 
AFFIRMED
.
Costs against petitioners.
