[ G.R. NO. 163712, November 30, 2006 ]


METROPOLITAN BANK AND TRUST COMPANY AND ROGELIO T. UY, PETITIONERS, VS. JOSE B. TAN AND ELIZA GO TAN, RESPONDENTS. 
 D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


On the application for extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage filed by herein petitioners Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank) and its Vice President Rogelio T. Uy (Uy), the Office of the Provincial Sheriff of Misamis Oriental issued a "Sheriff's Notice of Sale"
[1]
 setting on April 17, 1998 the sale at public auction of four mortgaged parcels of land including that covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-53267 (the title in question) registered in the name of herein respondent Jose B. Tan who was referred to in the title as "JOSE B. TAN, of legal age, Filipino, married to Eliza Go Tan. . . ."
[2]
A day before the scheduled public auction of the mortgaged properties or on April 16, 1998, respondent spouses Jose B. Tan and Eliza Go Tan filed a complaint
[3]
 against petitioners, along with Albano L. Cuarto, Sheriff IV of the Office of the Provincial Sheriff of Misamis Oriental, 
for
 
removal
 
of
 
cloud
 
on
 
the
 
title
 
in
 
question
 and injunction before the Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental.  The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 98-225.
Respondents cited the following grounds-bases of their complaint:
 Respondent 
Eliza
 
Go
 
Tan
 
never
 
gave
 
her
 
consent
 
or
 
conformity
 
to
 
encumber
 
the
 
title
 
in
 
question
;
 The real estate mortgages, annotated as Entries No. 142475, 146789, 174644, 213699, 247803, and 246959 at the back of TCT No. 52367 covering the questioned land are null and void because 
respondent
 
Jose
 
B.
 
Tan
 
had
 
already
 
fully
 
paid
 
the
 
obligations
 
secured
 by the mortgages annotated as Entries No. 14275, 146789, and 174644; while the mortgages registered as Entry No. 213699 (amendment of mortgage, amending a previous loan of P15,000,000 to P25,000,000) and Entry No. 246959 (amendment of mortgage amending a previous loan of P25,000,000 to P40,000,000), as well as 
any
 
mortgage
 
prior
 
to
 
that
 
registered
 
as
 
Entry
 
No.
 
213699
 
was
 
not
 
executed
 
and
 
signed
 
by
 [respondent Jose B. Tan].  (Underscoring supplied)
As scheduled, the public auction of the foreclosed properties took place on April 17, 1998 following which the Office of the Provincial Sheriff of Misamis Oriental issued a Sheriff's Certificate of Sale
[4]
 in the name of petitioner Metrobank, the highest bidder.
In their Answer
[5]
 to the Complaint, petitioners alleged that:
Plaintiffs
 [herein respondents], 
together with their two sons, Ariel and Rey John, 
obtained
 
a
 
credit
 
line
 from the defendant bank from which they made availments 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time
.  In time and always upon their plea, 
the
 
line
 
was
 
gradually
 
increased
 until it reached P40 million.  There was 
no
 
separate
 
or
 
distinct
 
loan
 
to
 
speak
 
of;
 
all
 
availments
 
or
 
releases
 
were
 
taken
 
from
 
one
 
and
 
the
 
same
 
line
.
In the same token, 
the
 
mortgage
 
constituted
 
on
 
the
 
four
 
lots,
 
TCT
 
No.
 
T-53267
 
included,
 
was
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
credit
 
line
 and not for any particular availment or for a determinate portion of the credit.  As such, 
the
 
mortgage
 
will
 
be
 
discharged
 
and
 
the
 
four
 
lots
 
released
 
only
 
upon
 
the
 
termination
 
of
 
the
 
line
, which means full payment of the entire loan â which plaintiffs never did.
[6]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Petitioners further alleged that the deeds of real estate mortgage,
[7]
 promissory notes,
[8]
 and credit line agreements
[9]
 bore the signature of respondent Jose B. Tan either for himself or as attorney-in-fact of his son Ariel Tan and, in one of them, his wife-co-respondent Eliza Go Tan's signature appeared.
By way of Counterclaim, petitioners prayed for the award of attorney's fees, compensatory and/or moral damages, exemplary damages, and other reliefs.
[10]
Crediting the testimony of respondent Jose B. Tan denying having 1) executed and signed the two amendments of the mortgage, 2) received the amount of P40,000,000, and 3) appeared before Notary Public Joel PeÃ±aranda who notarized
[11]
 the mortgage for P40,000.00, and likewise crediting the testimony of respondent Eliza Go Tan denying that the signature appearing on the real estate mortgage dated November 5, 1992 was hers,
[12]
 and finding that
. . . the existing loans covered by real estate mortgages annotated at the back of subject TCT No. T-53267 of the Registry of Deeds for Cagayan de Oro, 
had
 
been
 
fully
 
paid
 
as
 
of
 
July
 
1,
 
1997
, defendant Metrobank
 had no basis to be paid again through the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings
[13]
 (underscoring supplied)[,]
Branch 38 of the Misamis Oriental RTC, by Decision of March 5, 2001, rendered judgment in favor of respondents, disposing as follows:

SO ORDERED.
[14]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Petitioners appealed the trial court's decision before the Court of Appeals.
By Decision of November 21, 2003,
[15]
 the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision and accordingly dismissed petitioners' appeal.  And it denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.
[16]
Hence, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari filed on July 7, 2004.
[17]
The petition is impressed with merit.
Petitioners assail, in the main, the appellate court's affirmance of the trial court's decision absolving respondents from liability for the principal obligation obtained by their son Rey John Tan which was secured by real estate mortgages, including that covered by the title in question, and declaring such principal obligation of Rey John Tan, who is not a party to the case, to have been fully paid by him as of July 1, 1997, before the questioned extra-judicial foreclosure and public auction sale conducted on April 17, 1998.
[18]
Respondent Jose B. Tan
[19]
 insisted that he was not a party to the documents bearing on the grant of the credit line, he pointing to the absence of his signature above his typewritten name on the Credit Line Agreements, promissory notes, disclosure statements, and an Amendment of Real Estate Mortgage.  Respondents presented in evidence Promissory Notes â Exhibits "B-2" and "B-4" dated July 1, 1997 and June 24, 1997, respectively; three Credit Line Agreements â Exhibits "B-6," "B-7," and "B-8,"
[20]
 dated May 2, 1997; and the Agreement amending the real estate mortgage â Exhibit "B-9,"
[21]
 all dated May 2, 1997.
Petitioners, on the other hand, presented six Promissory Notes dated February 26, 1996, May 8, 1996, August 27, 1996, October 8, 1996, October 25, 1996, and November 18, 1996;
[22]
 five Credit Line Agreements dated September 9, 1991, September 24, 1992, September 2, 1993, November 3, 1994, and April 25, 1996;
[23]
 an Amendment of Real Estate Mortgage from P15,000,000 to P25,000,000; and October 29, 1996
[24]
 Amendment of Real Estate Mortgage from P25,000,000 to P40,000,000.
All document-exhibits of petitioners which are original copies bear the signature of respondent Jose B. Tan, however, 
as
 
solidary
 
co-debtor
 
of his
 
sons
 
Rey
 
John
 
Tan
 
and Ariel
 
Tan.
[25]
  And these documents were annotated at the back of the title in question.
[26]
In the absence of proof, nay allegation, that the signatures of respondent Jose B. Tan on the abovementioned documents were forged, this Court is constrained to uphold their genuineness.
[27]
As for the claim that respondent Eliza Go Tan did not give her consent to the mortgage of the title in question, the same  is belied by her signature
[28]
 on Exhibit "18"-Real Estate Mortgage which is annotated as Entry No. 174644 at the back of the title.  Her bare denial that the signature was forged, without more, does not lie.
In any event, lack of respondent Eliza Go Tan's consent to the mortgage covering the title in question would not render the encumbrance void under the second paragraph of Article 124 of the Family Code.
[29]
  For proof is wanting that the property covered by the title is conjugal â that it was acquired during respondents' marriage which is what would give rise to the presumption that it is conjugal property.
[30]
  The statement in the title that the property is "registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 of the Property Registration Decree in the name of 
JOSE B. TAN, of legal age, married to Eliza Go Tan"
[31]
 does not prove or indicate that the property is conjugal.  So 
Ruiz v. Court of Appeals
[32]
 instructs:
The property subject of the mortgage is registered in the name of "Corazon G. Ruiz, of legal age, 
married
 
to
 Rogelio Ruiz, Filipinos."  Thus, title is registered in the name of Corazon alone because 
the
 
phrase
 "
married
 
to
 
Rogelio
 
Ruiz
" 
is
 
merely
 
descriptive
 
of the
 
civil
 
status
 
of
 
Corazon
 and should not be construed to mean that her husband is also a registered owner.  Furthermore, registration of the property in the name of "Corazon G. Ruiz, of legal age, married to Rogelio Ruiz" 
is
 
not
 
proof that
 
such property
 
was
 
acquired
 
during
 
the
 
marriage
, and thus, is presumed to be conjugal.  The property could have been acquired by Corazon while she was still single, and registered only after her marriage to Rogelio Ruiz.  
Acquisition
 
of
 
title
 
and
 
registration thereof
 
are
 
two
 
different
 
acts
.  The presumption under Article 116 of the Family Code that properties acquired during the marriage are presumed to be conjugal cannot apply in the instant case.  Before such presumption can apply, it must first be established that the property was in fact acquired during the marriage.  In other words, proof of acquisition during the marriage is a condition 
sine qua non
 for the operation of the presumption in favor of conjugal ownership.  No such proof was offered nor presented in the case at bar.
[33]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
On respondents' claim of payment, they presented debit memo-Exhibits "G" to "G-11"
[34]
 (of which only Exhibits "G-6" to "G-11"
[35]
 are relevant to the issues) and certifications-Exhibits "H" and "H-1"
[36]
 issued by an accountant, one Glenn Cabading.
Rebutting Exhibits "G" to "G-11" inclusive, petitioners presented credit memos
[37]
 which, to them, cancelled respondents' debit memos.   From a comparison of the credit and debit memos with the bank ledgers
[38]
 and especially considering the unquestioned explanation of petitioner Uy on the reason behind the issuance of these memos, 
viz:
 
 
ATTY. DEL CASTILLO:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
You said, when a loan is renewed you credit a certain amount. Can you expound that a little bit?
 
 
 
A
 
Actually,
 
the
 
Banco
 
Central
 
punish[es]
 
if
 
the
 
loan
 
cannot
 
be
 
renewed
 
for
 
several years
 
without
 
payment
.
 
Just
 
to
 
circumvent
 
that
 
policy,
 
we
 
do
 
the
 
credit
 
first
 
and
 
the debit
 
just
 
for
 
the
 
renewal.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
Why is that?
 
 
 
A
 
To show that amount is fully paid and we avail.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
How is that done?
 
 
 
A
 
We
 
credit
 
first
 
the
 
renewed
 
amount
 
and
 
we
 
debit the
 
old
 
promissory
 
note
.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
When you credit, there were other papers accomplished?
 
 
 
A
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
What are these papers called?
 
 
 
A
 
Credit Memos on loan release.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
Where do you credit this?
 
 
 
A
 
It is credited on their accounts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
On the existing accounts?
 
 
 
A
 
Yes, deposit account.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
And what is debit memos?
 
 
 
A
 
Debit memos are ones that liquidate the loan so that the whole promissory note will be distinguished [
sic
].
[39]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),
 
 
this Court is persuaded by petitioners' claim that the debit memos represented "payment" only in the bank's book entries but did not actually involve payment/settlement of the original obligation.
In fine, the extra-judicial foreclosure and subsequent sale of the mortgaged property covered by the title in question was valid.
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
GRANTED
.  The assailed decision of the appellate court is 
SET ASIDE
.   Civil Case No. 98-225, "
