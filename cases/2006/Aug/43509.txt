[ G.R. NO. 152652, August 31, 2006 ]


TEODORO  STA.  ANA, PETITIONER, VS. LOURDES PANLASIGUE, JULIETA P. SANTIAGO AND SPOUSES IRENEO STA. ANA AND CANDIDA JARMIN, RESPONDENTS.

CARPIO MORALES, 
J
.:


Two parcels of land situated at Barrio Pineda, Pasig City, Lots 13-A and 13-B, each containing an area of 225 square meters, were registered in the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Rizal in the name of Petronilo Sta. Ana (Petronilo), married to Anatolia dela Rosa (Anatolia), under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 389002.
Petronilo died on March 22, 1980 leaving behind his widow Anatolia and ten children.
In 1984, Nicolas, one of the ten children of the Sta Ana couple, died leaving behind two children, Annaliza and Andrea.
On April 8, 1988, Anatolia, together with eight of her living children and Fe Sta Ana, the wife of her eldest child-herein petitioner Teodoro Sta. Ana (Teodoro) who was then abroad, executed a Deed of Sale covering Lot 13-A in favor of herein respondents Lourdes Panlasigue (Lourdes) and Julieta P. Santiago (Julieta).  On even date, Anatolia, together with the same eight children and Teodoro's wife Fe, donated Lot 13-B to Ireneo Sta. Ana (Ireneo), one of the Sta. Ana children, via a "Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and Donation"
[1]
 stating, 
inter alia,
 as follows, quoted 
verbatim
:
x x x x
That they are the only legitimate surviving spouses and children who survive the deceased Petronilo Sta. Ana.
That the said decedent [Petronilo Sta. Ana] died without leaving any will.
That the deceased left no debts;
x x x x
That the deceased left a certain residential lot [Lot 13-B] situated at Pasig Metro Manila and more particularly described and bounded as follows:
x x x x
That for and in consideration of the love and affection which the aforenamed parties hereinafter referred to as DONORS, hold for IRENEO, hereinafter referred to as DONEE, the DONORS do hereby transfers and conveys, by way of donation, into the DONEE Lot 13-B of TCT No. 389002.
That the DONORS do hereby state for the purpose of giving full effect to this donation, that they reserved unto  themselves in full ownerships other properties sufficient to support them in a manner appropriate  to their stations;
That the DONEE does hereby state that he accept this donation and at the same time expresses his profound gratitude for this demonstration of affection and act of liberality on the part of the DONORS who by these presents also take notice of this acceptance;
[2]
The two documents were annotated on Petronilo's title on May 6, 1988. 
On August 20, 1996, Teodoro filed a Complaint
[3]
 before the Pasig Regional Trial Court (RTC) against herein respondents-vendees of Lot 13-A,  Lourdes and Julieta, and his brother-donee Ireneo along with the latter's wife Candida Jarmin, 
for recovery of ownership and damages
, docketed as Civil Case No. 65860. 
In his complaint, Teodoro alleged that, 
inter alia,
 his "purported signature" in the Deed of Absolute Sale covering Lot 13-A as well as in the Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and Donation covering Lot 13-B was unauthorized and a forgery.  He thus prayed for the court to order:
defendants Panlasigue and Santiago 
to
 
reconvey
 
unto
 
the
 
plaintiff
 
his
 
one-eighteenth
 
(1/18)
 
share
 
in
 
Lot
 1
3-A;
defendants Ireneo Sta. and Jasmin Jarmin 
to
 
reconvey
 
unto
 
the
 
plaintiff
 
his
 
one-eighteenth
 
(1/18)
 
share
 
in
 
Lot
 
13-B;
defendants Ireneo Sta. Ana and Jasmin Jarmin, jointly and severally, to indemnify the plaintiff for moral damages of at least 
P
100,000.00; exemplary damages of at least 
P
50,000.00 and for attorney's fees of 
P
50,000.00. 
[4]
 (Underscoring supplied)
In their Answer
[5]
 to the Complaint, the defendants claimed that the sale of Lot 13-A and the donation of Lot 13-B were the collective decision of Anatolia and the rest of her children-co-heirs including Teodoro;  and that the proceeds of the sale were used to underwrite the hospitalization expenses of Anatolia and the expenses incurred by Ireneo who took care of Anatolia during her lifetime.
On May 30, 1997,
[6]
 Annaliza Sta. Ana and Andrea Sta Ana, children of Nicolas Sta. Ana (who, as earlier stated, died  in 1984), filed a Complaint-In-Intervention
[7]
 along with their motion for leave to file the same which was granted, alleging that they, as co-heirs, did not participate in the execution of the Deed of Sale and Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and Donation nor were they informed about it.  Hence, they prayed for judgment ordering
defendants Panlasigue and Santiago 
to
 
convey
 
unto
 
plaintiffs-intervenors
 
their
rightful
 
share
 in the property now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 66276 of the Register of Deeds in Pasig City, and
 
defendants Sps. Irineo and Candida Sta. Ana 
to
 
convey
 
unto
 
plaintiffs-intervenors
 
their
 
rightful
 
share
 in the property now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 66275 of the Register of Deeds in Pasig City.
[8]
  (Underscoring supplied)
Answering the Complaint-In-Intervention,
[9]
 the defendants proffered that "[t]here was a lot allotted to the deceased  [Nicolas-]father of the intervenors which the latter could inherit by right of representation."
[10]
It appears that during the hearing of the cases, the defendants claimed that the properties of Petronilo had, before the execution of the challenged documents, been distributed among all his heirs and that Lot 13-A and Lot 13-B were the conjugal share of his wife Anatolia.
Finding the extra-judicial partition a nullity for lack of conformity of other compulsory heirs Teodoro,  Annaliza  and Andrea, Branch 160 of the RTC Pasig, by Decision of October 15, 1999,
[11]
 nullified the challenged documents.  Thus it:
1)
 
Declar[ed] the extrajudicial partition as null and void;
2)
 
Declar[ed]the Deed of Absolute Sale between some of the heirs and defendants Panlasigue and Santiago as null and void and [ordered the latter] 
to
 
reconvey
 
the
 
property
 
subject
 
of
 
Deed
 
of
 
Absolute
 
Sale
 
in
 
favor
 
of
 "
Estate
 
of
 
Deceased
 
Petronilo
 
Sta.
 
Ana
" without prejudice to defendants Panlasigue and Santiago pursuing their claims against the Estate;
3)
 
Declar[ed]as null and void the Deed of Donation in favor of defendants Irineo Sta. Ana and Candida Jarmin-Sta. Ana and [ordered] them to 
reconvey
 
the
 
property
 
likewise
 
to
 
the
 
estate
 without prejudice to their filing of claim for whatever they have incurred for the hospitalization expenses and death of deceased mother Anatolia as provided by law.
[12]
 (Underscoring supplied)
Ireneo and his wife, Lourdes and Julieta, filed separate notices of appeal to the Court of Appeals.
Ireneo and his wife faulted the trial court:
. . . IN DECLARING THE EXTRAJUDICIAL PARTITION AS NULL AND VOID.
. . . IN DECLARING THE DEED OF DONATION IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT-APPELLANTS IRENEO STA. ANA AND CANDIDA JARMIN-STA. ANA NULL AND VOID.
. . . IN NOT ORDERING THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE TO PAY THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.
[13]
On the other hand, Lourdes and Julieta ascribed to the trial court the following errors:
. . . DECLARING THAT THERE WAS NO VALID PARTITION BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
. . . DECLARING THE DEED OF SALE BETWEEN ANATOLIA STA. ANA AND DEFENDANT-APPELLANTS PANLASIGUE AND SANTIAGO NULL AND VOID.
. . . NOT FINDING THAT THE RIGHT OF PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE TO QUESTION THE TITLE OF DEFENDANT-APPELLANTS PANLASIGUE AND SANTIAGO OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTY HAS ALREADY PRESCRIBED.
. . . NOT DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT  AND RENDERING JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT-APPELLANTS SANTIAGO AND PANLASIGUE AND AGAINST PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE UNDER THE FORMER'S COUNTERCLAIM.
[14]
The appellate court discredited the defendants' claim "that after the death of Petronilo Sta Ana but before 1988 [when the challenged documents were executed], his heirs consisting of his surviving wife and their [living] nine (9) children agreed orally to extrajudicially partition his estate and adjudicate to the mother Anatolia Lots 13-A and 13-B,"
[15]
 in light of the fact that Anatolia's children participated in the execution of the documents as owners and donors.   It thus held that the two lots were co-owned by Anatolia and her children.  
Applying Article 493 of the Civil Code which provides:
Each
 
co-owner
 
shall
 
have
 
the
 
full
 
ownership
 of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved.  But 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
alienation
 
or
 
the
 
mortgage
, 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
the
 
co-owners
, 
shall
 
be
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
portion
 
which
 
may
 
be
 
allotted
 
to
 
him
 in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership. (Underscoring supplied),
the appellate court held that the trial court erred in nullifying the assailed documents as in fact it noted that Teodoro and the intervenors-children of Nicolas merely prayed for reconveyance of their respective shares of the lots, and not for the declaration of nullity of said documents. 
The appellate court thus concluded:
The [two lots] belonged to the heirs in the following proportion:   
one-half
 
(1/2)
 
share
 
to
 
Anatolia
 
as
 
her
 
share
 
in
 
the
 
conjugal
 
partnership;
 whereas all nine (9) [
sic
] children plus Anatolia shared in the other one-half (1/2) belonging to Petronilo in shares of 1/10 each (Art. 996, Civil Code).  Otherwise stated, 
all
 
the
 
heirs
 
were
 
entitled
 
to
 
one-twentieth
 
(1/20)
 
share
 
of
 
the
 
property
 
except
 
Anatolia
 
who
 
was
 
entitled
 
to
 
eleven-twentieth
 
(11/20)
 share thereof.  With regard to the intervenors, the 1/20 share of their deceased father shall be divided between them since they succeed by right of representation (Art. 974, Civil Code).  And having affixed their signatures thereto, all the heirs are conclusively presumed to have admitted the regularity and validity of the deeds of sale and donation insofar as their respective portions were concerned.  Needless to state, 
both
 
the
 
deed
 
of
 
sale
 
and
 
deed
 
of
 
partition
 
with
 
donation
 
are
 
valid
.
[16]
 (Underscoring supplied)
Respecting the complaint of the intervenors, the appellate court held that they, as heirs of their father Nicolas, were not bound by the deeds, they not having participated therein, hence, they were entitled to their father's "1/20 [sic] share."
Respecting Teodoro's claim that he had no knowledge of the execution on his behalf by his wife of the two documents, the appellate court discredited the same, it noting that there was evidence that he had knowledge of the illness and treatment of his then sick mother, the expenses for which were shouldered by his brother Ireneo and his wife to thus necessitate the execution of the challenged documents. 
In another vein, the appellate court found plaintiff to be guilty of laches.
Thus, applying Art. 1101 of the Civil Code which provides:
Art. 1101.  The heir who is sued shall have the option of indemnifying the plaintiff for the loss, or consenting to a new partition.
Indemnity may be made by payment in cash or by the delivery of a thing of the same kind and quality as that awarded to the plaintiff.
x x x x ,
the appellate court disposed as follows:
WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  In lieu thereof, judgment is rendered 
ordering
 
defendants
 
to
 
reconvey
 
to
 
intervenors-appellees
 
their
 
1/20
 
share
 
of
 
the
 
property
 
or
 
its
 
equivalent
 
in
 
money.
  The case filed by plaintiff-appellee Teodoro Sta. Ana is 
DISMISSED
. With costs against the plaintiff-appellee.
[17]
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari filed by Teodoro (hereafter petitioner), raising the following arguments:
The extra-judicial partition is null and void.
The deed of sale between Anatolia Sta. Ana and Respondents Panlasigue and Santiago is null and void.
The right of Petitioner to question the title of Respondents Panlasigue and Santiago over the subject property has neither prescribed nor been barred by laches.
[18]
The first and second arguments of petitioner fail.  The  finding of the appellate court that the challenged deeds are not null and void is in accordance with law and evidence, as reflected in the discussion above.  Indeed, that the living children of Petronilo  joined Anatolia in the execution of the documents clearly shows that they were co-owners of the lots.  As such, they were at liberty to alienate their respective shares of the lots.
Respecting the last argument on laches, petitioner maintains that he had "no knowledge of the execution on his behalf by his wife" of the challenged documents, he being then out of the country. 
At the witness stand, however, petitioner declared on direct examination as follows:
Q.
 Mr. Sta. Ana, when you learned that lot 13-A was sold to defendant Lourdes Panlasique and Julieta Santiago, what did you do?
A.
 I was abroad at that time and when I arrived what I saw was the house was being constructed already.
[19]
And on cross examination, he admitted that his wife signed for him in the documents but that she was forced to do so.
[20]
In any event, petitioner contends that even assuming arguendo that he is guilty of laches, the case had not prescribed, he citing 
Mariategui v. Court of Appeals
[21]
 which held:
x x x Corollarily, prescription does not run against private respondents with respect to the filing of the action for partition so long as the heirs for whose benefit prescription is invoked, have not expressly  or  impliedly  repudiated the co-ownership.  
In
 
other
 
words
, 
prescription
 
of
 
an
 
action
 
for
 
partition
 
does
 
not
 
lie
 
except
 
when
 
the
 
co-ownership
 
is
 
properly
 
repudiated
 
by
 
the
 
co-owner
.
Otherwise stated, a co-owner cannot acquire by prescription the share of the other co-owners absent a clear repudiation of co-ownership duly communicated to the other co-owners.  Furthermore, an action to demand partition is imprescriptible and cannot be barred by laches. x x x
[22]
 (Emphasis and underscoring by petitioner)
Petitioner's citation of Mariategui is misplaced.  His complaint is not one for partition, but for reconveyance.
Jurisprudence of course dictates that the "[t]he doctrine of laches should never be applied earlier than the expiration of time limited for the commencement of actions,
[23]
 unless, as a general rule, inexcusable delay in asserting a right and acquiescence in existing conditions are proven."
[24]
From the annotation on May 6, 1988 of the challenged documents on Petronilo's title up to the filing by petitioner on August 20, 1996 of the complaint subject of the present case, a period of more than 8 years had elapsed.  Gratuitously assuming that  the  action  for  reconveyance  is  based   on  implied  trust,  it prescribes in 10 years. Therefore, petitioner's complaint had not prescribed  when  he  filed  his  complaint.  The  facts  and circumstances   attendant   to  the  case  reflected  above   indicate, however, that there was inexcusable delay on the part of Teodoro in asserting his right and acquiescence in existing conditions. 
The same situation does not hold true with respect to Nicolas' heirs-complainants-in-intervention.  Hence, laches cannot be attributed to them and, therefore, they are entitled to a reconveyance of their father's share.
The share of the father of complainants-in-intervention 
in
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
lots
 should be 1/11 of Â½ representing the share of each of the 10 siblings who were co-owners of said Â½, along with their mother Anatolia.  A modification of the sharing indicated in the decision of the appellate court is thus in order. 
A further modification of the decision would also have been called for.  For respondents-vendees had already paid for Lot 13-A, hence, no obligation for them to reconvey anything to the complainants-in-intervention arises.  They, however, did not appeal the appellate court's decision ordering all the defendants, including them - respondents-vendees, "to reconvey to intervenors-appellees" their share of the lot sold or its equivalent.  Hence, they are bound by said decision which constitutes the law of the case.
WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Court of Appeals is, in light of the foregoing discussions, 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
 in that respondent-spouses Ireneo Sta. Ana are 
ORDERED
 to contribute to the 1/11 share to be reconveyed to complainants-in-intervention in each of the two lots subject of the case representing the share of Nicolas Sta. Ana. 
Costs against petitioner.
