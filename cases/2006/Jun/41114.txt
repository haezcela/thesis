LEILANI E. NACIONALES, COMPLAINANT, VS. SHERYLL S. MADLANGBAYAN, CLERK III, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, BRANCH 210, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Leilani Nacionales (complainant) has, by Affidavit-Complaint,
[1]
 charged Sheryll S. Madlangbayan (respondent), Clerk III of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mandaluyong, Branch 210, of Misconduct, Conduct Unbecoming of Government Employee and Unethical Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of Service.
The complaint was eventually investigated by RTC Mandaluyong Executive Judge Paulita B. Acosta-Villarante.
Complainant was engaged in the business of selling jewelry and underwear.  Respondent was one of her customers who eventually became her close friend.
[2]
On November 14, 2002, complainant purchased a pair of shoes and a bag at a store in Greenhills, San Juan for a total amount of P8,198, payment for which complainant charged to respondentÃ¯Â¿Â½s BPI Credit Card account.
[3]
 The two agreed that complainant would pay respondent the total amount on installment basis.
On January 30, 2003, respondent bought a white gold bracelet from complainant which the latter represented to contain 14 carats (K), valued at P8,500, on a staggered payment basis with a downpayment of P3,000.  When the bracelet was appraised in the presence of complainant on February 18, 2003, it turned out that its gold content was below 14K.
Respondent thus decided to return the bracelet to complainant and to demand the return of her P3,000 downpayment.
By respondent's claim, complainant agreed to refund the  P3,000 after the latter could find a buyer of the bracelet.
[4]
Also by respondent's claim, she demanded the settlement of  the amount of P2,050 representing the balance of the payment of complainant's pair of shoes and bag which, as earlier stated, was charged to her (respondent's) credit card account
[5]
 but complainant refused to comply therewith unless she (respondent) first issued a receipt of her previous payment.
[6]
The friendship of the two soured and respondent allegedly sent text messages to complainant which contained slanderous words meant to harass, ridicule and embarrass her:
"Ang kapal ng mukha mo, walang patawad, kahit mahal na araw, may nakakita sa inyo sa loob na taga-OCC. Hindi ka man mabuking ngayon, sa ibang araw, nabubuking [sic] ka rin"; "If you want bastusan, I'll give it to you. Sabi ko kay Lloyd, pagbigyan ka ng isang gabi, kaya yan ang dahilan you are mad at me"; "Duwag ka naman eh"[;] "putang ina mo"[;] etc.
[7]
A confrontation between the two occurred in March 2003 which was witnessed by Mary Jane Rodillas, a canteen helper, and one Noemi Feje.
What transpired during the confrontation was narrated at the witness stand by complainant as follows:
ATTY. LEE:
In that incident which happened sometime in March 2003, what happened?
 
WITNESS [complainant]:
I was eating, I did not see her coming. It was 2:00 in the afternoon when she arrived and Noemi said, "here she comes. Isn't she your enemyÃ¯Â¿Â½"
 
ATTY. LEE:
What happened after that?
 
WITNESS:
She passed by my side and then she was making ismid [
sic
].
 
ATTY. LEE:
What happened after that?
 
WITNESS:
I turned to her and asked what is her problem.
 
ATTY. LEE:
What did she say in return?
 
WITNESS:
She
 
suddenly
 
gave
 
me
 
a
 
middle
 
finger
 
sign
.
 
ATTY. LEE:
What did you do after having seen that she did that making finger sign?
 
WITNESS:
I don't understand what that meant. Sir.
 
ATTY. LEE:
Any reaction from that finger sign that the respondent did?
 
WITNESS:
I asked my companion what is it mean [
sic
].
 
ATTY. LEE:
What did your companion say?
 
WITNESS:
She said, "Later, because you might run after her when you find out what that means."
 
ATTY. LEE:
After that, what happened?
 
WITNESS:
She stopped at the far end of the canteen and stayed there and 
she
 
was
 
still
 
making
 
the
  
middle
 
finger
 
sign
 
and
 
she
 
was
 
challenging
 
 me
.
 
ATTY. LEE:
You said that she was wearing something?
 
ATTY. LEE:
No question yet, your Honor.
 
WITNESS:
Yes, sir, uniform.
 
 
ATTY. LEE:
What
 
was
 
the
 
uniform
 
being
 
worn
 
by
 
the
 
 respondent
 
at
 
that
 
time
?
 
WITNESS:
Yellow-green
 
blouse
 
and
 
fatigue-like
 
 pants
.
[8]
 
 
 
 The foregoing account was substantially corroborated at the witness stand by Mary Jane Rodillas.
[9]
Advancing a different version of the incident, respondent alleged  in her  Counter-Affidavit as follows:
x x x What really transpired is: I came from METROBANK and when I passed by the canteen near the Mandaluyong Gymnasium, I did not notice the complainant until I heard shouts from her 
"ANONG PROBLEMA MO
" etc. and also 
shouted
 
"SHERYLL MANIAC"
. 
And
 
this
 
did
 
not
 
happen
 
in
 
the
 
office
 
but
 
near
 
the canteen
 
beside
 
the
 
Mandaluyong
 
Gymnasium
. Calling me 
SHERYLL MANIAC
 is a very serious insult and an attack on my person and personality, since I am a lady, single of 24 years of age, and don't belong to the category she branded me as "
MANIAC
."
[10]
(Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied).
In her Affidavit-Complaint, complainant claimed that respondent shouted "fuck you" and made a "dirty middle finger sign" at her. This claim was corroborated by Mary Jane Rodillas and Noemi Feje in their respective affidavits. 
Not denying having uttered "fuck you" and  made dirty  middle finger sign, respondent justified the same by claiming that they were done in retaliation. Thus she testified:
Q [Atty. Floirendo]- Madam witness, in your counter affidavit, paragraph 9, you stated that, and if I may quote your honor please, x x x  Do you confirm and affirm the truth and veracity of this paragraph?
A - Yes ma'am.
Atty. Floirendo - You mean to say madam witness that 
it
 
was
 
the complainant
 
who
 
shouted
 
to
 
you
 
first
 
when
 
you
 
saw
 
her
 
near
 
the
 
 Mandaluyong
 
Gymnasium
 on the date she complained of?
A - Yes ma'am.
[11]
In her Investigation Report,
[12]
 Judge Acosta-Villarante found as follows:
Respondent Madlangbayan was charged for Misconduct and Conduct Unbecoming a Government Employee.
Misconduct generally means wrongful, improper, unlawful conduct motivated by a premeditated, obstinate or intentional purpose (Words and Phrases, Vol. 27, page 466, citing Sewell vs. Sharp, LA APP. 102 So 2d 259, 261).
From the evidence presented, complainant, through [sic] nervous, and her witness Mary Jane Rodillas, a canteen helper, testified in a candid and straightforward manner indicating sincerity and truthfulness. The Investigating Presiding Judge is persuaded that a confrontation between complainant and respondent did in fact occur. As claimed by respondent, she came from METROBANK and passed by the canteen. Mary Jane Rodillas testified that the time is 2:30 in the afternoon which respondent failed to deny.
It should be stressed that respondent has been nursing grudge/hatred against complainant 
by
 
reason
 
of
 
the
 
latter's
  
non-payment
 
of
 
her
 
balance
 
in
 
the
 
credit
 
card
 
and
 
her
 
refusal
 
to
 
return
 
the
 
downpayment
 
on
 
the
 
bracelet
 despite insistent demands by respondent. What is more, the irreconcilable differences had reached such a magnitude to the extent that respondent reported this matter to her parents who called complainant to pay her indebtedness but complainant allegedly invented stories to respondent's parents by saying, "Sinabihan ako ng anak niyo na walang hiya kayong magulang niya, etc." which caused the ire of respondent.
The
 
Investigating
 
Presiding
 
Judge
 
finds
 
credible
 
the
 
allegation
 
of complainant
 
that
 
respondent
 
had
 
been
 
sending
 
embarrassing
 
text
 
messages to
 
harass
 
complainant
 who appears adamant to the respondent's demands.
The Code of Judicial Ethics  mandates that the conduct of court personnel must be free from any kind of impropriety, not only with respect to their duties in the judicial branch but also to their behavior outside the court as private individuals, inorder to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice.
Under the given facts, the unprofessional conduct of respondent as court employee could bring the court into disrepute.
[13]
 (Emphasis and underlining in the original;  underscoring supplied).
Thus finding for complainant, Judge Acosta-Villarante recommended that respondent be only reprimanded as this is the first offense that she committed and that her actuations were "anchored on legitimate demands."
[14]
Then Court Administrator, now Supreme Court Associate  Justice Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr., by Report of August 16, 2005,
[15]
 took exception to Judge Acosta-Villarante's findings in this wise:
Even if respondent has legitimate demands against complainant, it is still improper for a court employee to make offensive and foul remarks. High strung and belligerent behavior has no place in government service where the personnel are enjoined to act with self-restraint and civility at all times even when confronted with rudeness and insolence. Conduct violative of this standard quickly and surely corrodes respect for the courts.
However, the fact that this is respondent's first offense is considered a mitigating circumstance in her favor. A fine of P1,000.00 is therefore recommended.
[16]
This Court finds Justice Velasco's position well-taken.
Even if respondent acted in retaliation to complainant's calling her "Sheryll Maniac" when she uttered "fuck you" and made a dirty finger sign, that these were done in public by a court employee who was then wearing office uniform creates a bad impression not only against respondent as an employee but also against the judiciary.
Courts are looked upon by the people with high respect. Misbehavior by their employees within and around their vicinity necessarily diminishes their sanctity and dignity.
[17]
  The injunction of this Court in 
Cervantes v. CardeÃ±o
 thus bears reiterating:
We take this opportunity to remind, not only the respondent, but all court personnel as well, that the image of the judiciary is 
mirrored in the kind of conduct, 
official
 
or
 
otherwise
, which the personnel within its employ display
, from the judge to the lowest clerk. Any 
fighting
 or misunderstanding becomes a 
disgraceful
 
sight
 
reflecting
 
adversely
 
on
 
the good
 
image
 
of
 
the
 
judiciary
. Professionalism, respect for the rights of others, good manners and right conduct are expected of all judicial officers and employees. Thus, all employees are required to preserve the judiciary's good name and standing as a  true temple of justice.
[18]
 (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied).
Disgraceful conduct is classified as a grave offense under Section 52(A) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service which is punishable by suspension of Six (6) Months and One (1) Day to One (1) Year for the first offense. 
Following the case of 
Policarpio v. Fortus
,
[19]
 however, cited by Justice Velasco in his Report wherein the therein respondent was found to have been engaged in discourteous acts improper of an employee of the Judiciary and was fined P1,000, this Court finds reasonable the recommended penalty of fine in the amount of P1,000.
WHEREFORE
, for disgraceful acts improper of an employee of the judiciary, respondent Sheryll S. Madlangbayan, Clerk III of the Regional Trial Court of Mandaluyong City, Branch 210, is 
FINED
 the amount of One Thousand Pesos. And she is 
WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future will be dealt with more severely.  
SO ORDERED.
Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, 
and 
Tinga, JJ., 
concur.
Velasco, Jr., J., 
no part due to prior action of OCA.
