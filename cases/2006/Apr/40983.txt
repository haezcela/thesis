ERNELIZA  Z.  MAMARIL, PETITIONER, VS. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION AND DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


The present Petition for Review on Certiorari seeks a relaxation of the Rules on verification and certification against forum shopping, petitioner's Petition for Review of a Civil Service Commission Resolution having been dismissed
[1]
 by the appellate court for failure to comply therewith.
On October 10, 1983, Erneliza Mamaril (petitioner) was hired by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) as Stenographic Reporter on a temporary status. On March 15, 1984, she was promoted to Administrative Assistant II, a permanent position. In 1992, then DOTC Secretary Jesus B. Garcia, Jr. appointed her as Department Legislative Liaison Specialist (DLLS), a coterminous position. Her appointment as DLLS was renewed by the succeeding DOTC Secretaries.
[2]
On December 19, 2000, then DOTC Secretary Vicente C. Rivera, Jr. requested the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to attest that at least two of the four DLLS positions in the DOTC be made permanent. The request was granted by the CSC by Resolution No. 01-0233 dated January 23, 2001.
[3]
Upon verbal query by DOTC Director Carina S. Valera (Director Valera), then CSC Chairman Corazon Alma de Leon advised the DOTC that the incumbents of the formerly coterminous DLLS positions had no vested right to occupy the already permanent DLLS positions, and that they were not automatically appointed thereto; and the positions which were made permanent could only be filled up by following existing CSC rules and regulations as well as DOTC policies and guidelines on the appointment of personnel.
[4]
By letter of January 29, 2001,
[5]
 DOTC Assistant Secretary for Administrative and Legal Affairs Wilfredo Trinidad (Trinidad) sought from the CSC a written confirmation of its Chairman's above-said advice.
[6]
  Pending receipt of a reply from the CSC, Trinidad sent separate letters dated February 22, 2001 to petitioner
[7]
 and Rolando Cruz,
[8]
 the other incumbent of the two DLLS positions, advising each of them as follows:
The change of the nature of the DLLS position which you held, from coterminous to 
permanent
 pursuant to CSC Resolution No. 010233 dated 23 January 2001
 did
 
not
 
automatically
 
make
 
you
 
the
 
holder of
 
the
 
now
 
permanent DLLS
 
position.
 This interpretation was 
confirmed
 
by
 
Director
 
Carina
 
S.
 
Valera with
 
the
 
then
 
CSC
 
Chairman de Leon.
As your appointment was of cotermin[o]us nature, 
your
 
services
 
automatically terminated
 
with
 
the
 
non-existence
 
of
 
the
 
cotermin[o]us
 
position
 
and the
 
advent
 
of the
 
new
 
appointing
 
authority.
When the new DLLS permanent positions are authorized to be filled up, you can apply therefor. In the meantime, you may seek appointment to any other vacant position that suits your qualifications. Needless to say, selection in any case will follow the usual process in accordance with the DOTC guidelines and the CSC rules and regulations. (Underscoring supplied)
Acting on the above-said query of Trinidad, the CSC, by Resolution No. 01-0502 dated February 22, 2001
[9]
 which was received at his office on March 9, 2001 and by the DOTC Personnel Division on March 12, 2001,
[10]
 ruled that "the two occupants of the two DLLS positions are 
ipso facto
 appointed to such positions under permanent status
 if
 
they
 
meet
 
the
 
minimum
 
requirements
 
of
 
the
 
said
 
positions.
"
In light of the contrary advice previously given by the former CSC Chairman de Leon, the DOTC, by letter of April 27, 2001, sought clarification on CSC Resolution No. 01-0502.
By Resolution No. 01-1409 issued on August 20, 2001, the CSC modified Resolution No. 01-0502 by declaring that "the
 previous incumbents 
of the two Department Legislative Liaison Specialist (DLLS) positions 
were 
no
 
longer
 
existing
 
employees
 as of the date said positions were declared by the Commission as career 
in CSC Resolution No. 01-0233 dated January 23, 2001," and that "DOTC Secretary Pantaleon D. Alvarez may now appoint who will occupy these newly created DLLS positions . . ."
[11]
By petitioner's own information, her services were "effectively terminated" on September 1, 2001 upon which her name was deleted from the payroll.
[12]
Petitioner and Cruz filed a Motion for Reconsideration of CSC Resolution No. 01-1409.  By Resolution of November 26, 2002, the CSC issued Resolution No. 02-1504 reconsidering and setting aside CSC Resolution No. 01-1409.  P
etitioner
 
was thus reinstated
 
to
 
her
 
former
 
position 
on November 26, 2002.
[13]
The DOTC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of CSC Resolution No. 02-1504 which was denied, by Resolution No. 03-1019 dated September 26, 2003.  In the same Resolution, the CSC declared that petitioner and Cruz are 
not entitled
 
to
 
back
 
salaries from
 
the
 
time
 
they
 
were separated
 
from
 
the
 
service
 
up
 
to
 
their
 
date
 
of
 
reinstatement
.
[14]
Petitioner thus filed a Motion for Reconsideration of said Resolution No. 03-1019 only insofar as the CSC held that she was not entitled to backwages.  By Resolution No. 04-0279
[15]
 issued on March 18, 2004, the CSC denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.
Petitioner thereupon filed on March 7, 2004 before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Review under Rule 43 assailing CSC Resolution No. 03-1019
[16]
 which the appellate court dismissed, as earlier stated, by Resolution of May 14, 2004,
[17]
 for non-compliance with the Rules, it not having been verified and it containing no sworn certification against forum shopping.
Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the appellate court's May 14, 2004 Resolution to which she attached a verified petition with certification against forum shopping, but it was denied by Resolution of August 6, 2004, the appellate court holding that her subsequent compliance with the Rules "[did] not cleanse her Petition of its infirmity."
[18]
Hence, the present petition, petitioner arguing that,
I
THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS DID NOT ONLY COMMIT GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER'S SUBSEQUENT COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES OF COURT DOES NOT CLEANSE HER PETITION OF ITS INFIRMITY, BUT ALSO DISREGARDED THE JURISPRUDENTIAL DOCTRINE THAT 
RULES
 
OF PROCEDURE,
 
WHICH
 
ARE
 
MERELY
 
SECONDARY
 
IN
 
IMPORTANCE, OUGHT
 
NOT
 
TO
 
BE
 
APPLIED
 
IN
 
A
 
VERY
 
RIGID
 
AND
 
TECHNICAL SENSE
 AS THEY ARE USED ONLY TO HELP SECURE NOT OVERRIDE SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE.
II
THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE P
ETITIONER IS
 
ENTITLED
 
TO
 
BACK
 
SALARIES
 
FROM
 
THE
 
TIME
 
OF
 
HER ILLEGAL
 
TERMINATION
 
BY
 
RESPONDENT DOTC
 
UP
 
TO
 
THE
 
TIME OF
 
HER
 
ACTUAL
 
REINSTATEMENT.
[
19]
  (Underscoring supplied)
Petitioner pleads that the dismissal of her petition by the appellate court should be without prejudice as its infirmity was cured by her subsequent and substantial compliance
[20]
 with the Rules which should not be rigidly applied to defeat and override the ends of justice.
[21]
On the merits of her petition, petitioner asserts that every employee of the civil service is entitled to security of tenure and should not be removed or suspended except for cause provided by law.  She concludes that she having been "illegally dismissed," she must not only be reinstated but must be entitled to all the rights and privileges that accrued to her by virtue of the office she held, such as her right to back salaries.
[22]
The petition is bereft of merit.
Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 7 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure lay down the rules on verification and certification against forum shopping as follows:
SEC. 4. 
Verification.
 - Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath, verified or accompanied by affidavit.
A pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and correct of his personal knowledge or based on authentic records.
A pleading required to be verified which contains a verification based on "information and belief" or upon "knowledge, information, and belief," or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading. (As amended, A.M. No. 00-2-10 SC, May 1, 2000.)
SEC. 5. 
Certification against forum shopping
. - The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.
Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing.
 The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions." (Emphasis supplied)
The purpose of requiring a verification is to secure an assurance that the allegations of the petition have been made in good faith, or are true and correct, not merely speculative.
[23]
  Non-compliance with such requirement does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective, hence, the court may order its correction if verification is lacking, or act on the pleading although it is not verified if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rules may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may thereby be served.
[24]
On the other hand, the rule against forum shopping is rooted in the principle that a party-litigant shall not be allowed to pursue simultaneous remedies in different fora, as this practice is detrimental to orderly judicial procedure. The lack of certification against forum shopping, unlike that of verification, is 
generally
 not curable by the submission thereof after the filing of the petition.
[25]
  The submission of a certificate against forum shopping is thus deemed obligatory, albeit not jurisdictional.
[26]
The rule on certification against forum shopping may, however, be also relaxed on grounds of "substantial compliance" or "special circumstance or compelling reasons." The Court thus examined the records of the case on hand to determine the existence of any circumstances or compelling reasons which call for the relaxation of the Rules but appreciated none in light of the following discussion.
The general proposition is that a public official is not entitled to any compensation if he has not rendered any service. As he works, so shall he earn.
[27]
 Compensation is paid only for service actually or constructively rendered."
[28]
Petitioner's services were actually terminated on 
September 1, 2001,
 after the CSC issued Resolution No. 01-1409 dated August 20, 2001 declaring that "the previous incumbents of the two Department Legislative Liaison Specialist (DLLS) positions were no longer existing employees as of the date said positions were declared by the Commission as career."  She was, however, reinstated on 
November 26, 2002
 after the CSC issued on even date Resolution No. 02-1504 setting aside Resolution No. 01-1409.
Octot v. YbaÃ±ez
[29]
 instructs that the good faith or bad faith and grave abuse of discretion in the dismissal or termination of the services of a government employee come into play in the determination of the award of back salaries upon his reinstatement.  In said case, the therein petitioner, a security guard in the Regional Health Office No. VII, Cebu City who had been convicted of libel by a trial court, was 
summarily
 
dismissed
 
pursuant
 
to
 
Presidential
 
Decree
 
No.
 
6
 
and
 
LOI
 
Nos.
 
14
 
and
 
14-A
 issued by then President Marcos directing heads of departments and agencies of the government to weed out undesirable government officials and employees, specifically those who were facing charges or were notoriously undesirable on the ground of dishonesty, incompetence or other kinds of misconduct defined in the Civil Service Law.  The therein petitioner was eventually acquitted of the criminal charge. Hence, his request for reinstatement was granted but 
not
 
his
 
claim
 
for
 
back
 
salaries
 from the date of his dismissal. This Court, through then Chief Justice Teehankee, held:
In the absence of proof that respondent Regional Director acted in 
bad faith 
and with 
grave abuse of discretion,
 petitioner is not entitled to backwages and consequently cannot claim for damages. In the case at bar, the record manifests that respondents officials were 
not
 
motivated
 
by
 
ill
 
will
 
or
 
personal
 
malice
 
in dismissing
 
petitioner
 but only by their 
desire to comply with the mandates of
 
Presidential Decree No. 6
.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
The denial of the award of back salaries, absent a showing of bad faith and/or grave abuse of discretion in the termination of the services of a government employee who was reinstated, was reiterated in 
Clemente v. Commission on Audit
,
[30]
 
Acting Director of Prisons v. Villaluz,
[31]
 and 
Echeche v. Court of Appeals
.
[32]
Petitioner, however, invokes the rulings in 
TaÃ±ala v. Legaspi
,
[33]
 
De Guzman v. Civil Service Commission,
[34]
 
Gabriel v. Domingo
,
[35]
 
Del Castillo v. Civil Service Commission
[36]
 to the effect that when an official or employee was illegally dismissed and his reinstatement is ordered, for all legal purposes he is considered as not having left his office and, therefore, is entitled to all rights and privileges that accrue to him by virtue of the office.
To begin with, petitioner cannot be considered to have been illegally dismissed.  Her services were terminated effective September 1, 2001 by the DOTC in light of the CSC August 20, 2001 Resolution.
At any rate, no parity of circumstances in the above-cited cases invoked by petitioner obtains in the case at bar.
In 
TaÃ±ala
, payment of back salaries upon reinstatement was ordered upon 
acquittal
 
in a
 
criminal
 
case
 of the regular employee of the government who had been suspended as a result of the filing of said case.
[37]
 
De Guzman
 involved a proscribed abolition of office,
[38]
 hence, payment of back salaries was ordered upon reinstatement of the separated employee.  In 
Del Castillo
, the therein petitioner was preventively suspended and later dismissed for grave misconduct.
[39]
 He was eventually exonerated.  He was thus ordered reinstated.  He thereafter filed a "Motion for Clarificatory Relief" praying for an award of backwages.  Noting that the CSC did not object to the payment of backwages and the Solicitor General in fact recommended the payment thereof, this Court granted the motion.
In 
Gabriel
, the therein petitioner was holding a permanent position of Motor Vehicle Registrar I at the Motor Vehicles Office, later renamed the Land Transportation Commission.  In 1979, the Land Transportation Commission was reorganized, renaming 
plantilla
 positions. The therein petitioner's position was changed to Transportation District Supervisor, but since another had been appointed thereto, he 
filed
 
a
 
protest.
  During the pendency of his protest, he was extended a casual appointment but his services were "in effect terminated" three days later, drawing him to
 file a complaint
 for illegal termination of services which reached the CSC.  The CSC eventually found that the issuance to the therein petitioner of a casual appointment which resulted in the termination of his services was illegal and that he was more qualified than the one appointed to his renamed position of Transportation District Supervisor.  The CSC accordingly directed his appointment to his former position.  He was appointed alright but to a lower position. He later filed a 
claim
 
for
 
backwages
 which was denied by the Commission on Audit but which this Court ordered granted.
In all these cases, the suspensions and/or dismissals were held unjustified, the therein petitioners having been either exonerated from the charges-bases of suspension or dismissal or were victims of proscribed abolition of office or issuance of appointment to a different position which soon after resulted in dismissal therefrom.
That the DOTC's termination of petitioner's services in accordance with the August 20, 2001 Resolution of the CSC was not attended with bad faith and/or grave abuse of discretion, it cannot, under the facts and circumstances of the case, be gainsaid.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED.
Costs against petitioner.
