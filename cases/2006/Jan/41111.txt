However, he again failed to fully comply with the July 2004 Memorandum citing as reasons his work load as Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, as Presiding Judge of Branch 47 and Pairing Judge of Branch 48.
[8]
 He requested for another three months within which to decide and resolve all the pending cases and incidents before his sala. 
 
[9]
After the lapse of the three-month period requested to "fully comply" with the July 2004 Memorandum, Judge Emuslan informed the OCA 
[10]
 that despite best efforts, he still could not comply because of increasing work load and failing health.  Thus, he again requested for an additional period of 90 days 
[11]
 which the OCA granted 
[12]
 provided it will be the 
last and final extension otherwise the matter shall be referred to the Court for appropriate action
.
[13]
 "Full compliance" included the submission of proof of the action taken within five days from rendition or issuance thereof, which Judge Emuslan failed to submit despite repeated instructions.
On September 7, 2005, Judge Emuslan informed the OCA of the actions taken on the pending cases but did not attach proofs of his actions. Also, despite OCA'S previous warning that requests for extension will no longer be entertained, he again requested for an additional period of three months. 
 
[14]
Upon evaluation, the OCA observed that despite the several extensions granted to Judge Emuslan, he was able to dispose only 14 out of the 49 cases enumerated in paragraph (a) of the July 2004 Memorandum, leaving 35 cases still undecided; 
 
[15]
 and of the 14 cases listed in paragraph (c), six were decided/resolved while eight remained unacted.  The OCA however was not furnished with proofs that these cases were decided or acted upon. 
[16]
In view of the foregoing, the OCA recommended that:
(1) Case be 
REDOCKETED
 as a regular administrative matter;
(2) For failing to file his compliances 
fully, completely and faithfully
  with the various directives of the Office of the OCA, the Hon. Meliton G. Emuslan, Presiding Judge, RTC, Br. 47, Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, be meted a FINE in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00); and
(3) He (Judge Emuslan) be again further DIRECTED to 
fully, completely and faithfully COMPLY 
with the Memorandum, dated July 2004 of the OCA and the various Memorandum thereafter issued, specially the Memorandum, dated 29 June 2005 according him (Judge Emuslan) a last and final extension to FULLY COMPLY with the Memorandum, dated July 2004, otherwise the matter shall finally be referred to the Court for appropriate action(;) and that full compliance hereof shall include the submission by him of proof of the action taken of the cases mentioned in the Memorandum, dated July 2004, which he failed to do so up to now.  In this respect his attention is called to the portion of the Memorandum, dated July 2004 to him which provides:
"2. Compliance with the above directives together with copies of the resolutions/orders, etc. in the aforecited cases shall be submitted to the Court, through the Court Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, within five (5) days from rendition, issuance or action taken thereon."
(4) Considering his latest request for extension of ninety (90) days, embodied in his Letter, dated 25 July 2005, Judge Emuslan be GRANTED
 a three (3) months extension,
 within which to comply with the Memorandum, dated July 2004 of the OCA, to commence from the date of notice hereof, 
provided that this will be the LAST AND FINAL EXTENSION that the Court will accord him to fully, completely and faithfully comply with the aforesaid Memorandum.
 
[17]
Time and again the Court has stated that members of the judiciary have the sworn duty to administer justice without undue delay. Delay in the disposition of cases undermines the people's faith and confidence in the judiciary. Hence, judges are enjoined to decide cases with dispatch. Their failure to do so constitutes gross inefficiency and warrants the imposition of administrative sanction[s] against them. 
[18]
The office of a judge exists for one solemn end â to promote the ends of justice by administering it speedily and impartially. The judge, as the person presiding over that court, is the visible representation of the law and justice. These are self-evident dogmas which do not even have to be emphasized, but to which we are wont to advert when some members of the judiciary commit legal missteps or stray from the axioms of judicial ethics. 
[19]
 Failure to resolve cases submitted for decision within the period fixed by law constitutes a serious violation of the constitutional right of the parties to a speedy disposition of their cases. 
[20]
  Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states in no uncertain terms that a judge should administer justice impartially and 
without delay
 while Rule 3.05, Canon 3 requires the judge to dispose of the court's business 
promptly
 and decide cases 
within the required periods.
The Court has laid down administrative guidelines to ensure that the mandates on the prompt disposition of judicial business are complied with. Thus, SC Administrative Circular No. 13-87 states, 
inter alia
, that:
The reorganized judiciary is tasked with the tremendous responsibility of assisting parties litigants in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their cases and proceedings as directed in Rule 1, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Court. 
[21]
 Delay is a recurring complaint of every litigant. 
The main objective of every judge, particularly of trial judges, should be to avoid delays,
 or if it cannot be totally avoided, to hold them to the minimum and to repudiate manifestly dilatory tactics.
GENERAL GUIDELINES
For all members of the judiciary, the following guidelines are hereby issued:
x x x x
3. 
Judges shall observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15, of the Constitution for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts. 
Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts while all other lower courts are given a period of three months to do so. (Emphasis added)
Along the same vein, SC Administrative Circular No. 1-88 states that:
Pursuant to Sec. 12, Art. XVIII of the 1987 Constitution mandating the adoption of a systematic plan to expedite the decision or resolution of cases or matters pending in the Supreme Court and the lower courts prior to the effectivity of the Constitution on February 2, 1987, the following directives must be complied with strictly by all concerned.
x x x x
6. 
Motions and Other Interlocutory Matters:
6.1 All Presiding Judges must endeavor to 
act promptly 
on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts.
The records show that Judge Emuslan failed to decide the cases submitted for decision and to resolve pending incidents and motions, despite the lapse of more than a year since he was directed to comply.  The excuses he proffered to explain his tardiness are not satisfactory.  If respondent judge felt that he could not decide the cases or the pending incidents within the reglementary period, he should have asked for extension of time to dispose of the same. This Court, cognizant of the caseload of judges and mindful of the difficulty encountered by them in the seasonable disposition of cases, have always granted requests for extension of time to decide. 
[22]
What aggravates the malfeasance of Judge Emuslan is his refusal to heed the directives of the OCA to submit proof of his compliance. His prolonged and repeated refusal to comply constitutes a clear and willful disrespect for lawful orders of the OCA.  It has been stressed that it is through the OCA that the Supreme Court exercises supervision over all lower courts and personnel thereof. At the core of the judge's esteemed position is obedience to the dictates of the law and justice. A judge must be the first to exhibit respect for authority. 
[23]
 Judge Emuslan failed in this aspect when he repeatedly ignored the lawful orders of the OCA.
A resolution of the Supreme Court is not be construed as a mere request nor should it be complied with partially, inadequately or selectively. 
[24]
In the light of the prevailing facts of this case, we find that a fine of P20,000.00 
[25]
 is commensurate under the circumstances.
WHEREFORE,
 Judge Meliton G. Emuslan, Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, Branch 47, is 
FINED
 Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) for gross inefficiency for failure to comply with the Memorandum of the Office of the Court Administrator dated July 2004.  Respondent judge is further 
WARNED
 that a repetition of similar infractions shall be dealt with more severely.
SO ORDERED.
