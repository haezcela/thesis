LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. ESPERANZA M. ESTEBAN, RESPONDENT.

GAERLAN, J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 

Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking the
 reversal and setting aside of the Decision
[2]
 dated November 10, 2010 and the 
Resolution
[3]

 dated July 14, 2011 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 
01431. The assailed issuances affirmed the Consolidated Decision
[4]
 dated October 18, 2005
 and Order
[5]

 dated November 14, 2006 of Branch 27 of the Regional Trial Court of 
Tandag, Surigao del Sur in Civil Case No. 1514, for fixing of just 
compensation. 
 
Antecedents


 At the core of the instant controversy is an 
untitled parcel 
of land identified as Lot 2493, Cad. 537-D, located at Barangay Mahayag,
 San Miguel, Surigao del Sur, comprising an area of 6.1833 hectares, 
more or less, and covered by Tax Declaration (TD) No. B-16-12-236
[6]
 in the name of 
respondent Esperanza M. Esteban (respondent).
 
Pursuant to Section 64
[7]
 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657 otherwise known 
as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, in relation to Section
 74
[8]
 of R.A. No.
 3844,
[9]

 petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) is the government 
financial institution established to aid in the implementation of the 
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) as well as to act as 
financial intermediary of the Agrarian Reform Fund.
[10]
 

 On June 20, 1994, respondent made a voluntary offer to sell the subject
 property to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) for said agency's 
acquisition under R.A. No. 6657 at the price of P60,000.00 per hectare 
or a total of P370,998.00. Following its evaluation of the subject 
property, LBP's Land Valuation Office XI issued on August 16, 1999 its 
Claims Valuation and Processing Form No. LBP-XI-VO-95-6697
[11]

 setting the just compensation for the subject property at P12,295.42 
per hectare, or a total amount of P76,026.27 based on the following 
formula:
[12]








 


 


LV = MV x 2






Where: 



 


 






 


LV


= Land Value 






 


MV


= Market Value per Tax Declaration 








Respondent, however, rejected LBP's valuation. Thus, she 
filed a Petition
[13]
 for judicial determination of just compensation
 with the RTC on November 14, 2002.


 During the trial, the RTC constituted a Board of 
Commissioners 
(BOC) to examine and appraise the subject property. Thereafter, the BOC 
recommended the valuation of P43,327.16 per hectare, or a total amount 
of P267,907.88, for the subject property.
[14]

 On October 18, 2005, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of respondent. 
The trial court noted that, as found by the BOC, the subject property 
contained five hectares of unirrigated land that had already been 
planted with palay while about one hectare thereof was idle. Thus, the 
RTC disposed as follows:
  


 WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the 
petitioners and against respondents, determining and fixing the just 
compensations for petitioners' properties, as follows:


 For Lot No. 2493, subject of Civil Case No. 1514, at 
P43,327.16 
per hectare or a total of P267,907.83 for the entire 6.1833 hectares; 



 For Lot No. 2665, subject of Civil Case No. 1515, at 
P18,427.50 
per hectare or a total of P168,251.13 for the entire 9.1306 hectares; 



 For Lot No. 2636, subject of Civil Case No. 1516, at 
P43,327.16 
per hectare or a total of P404,632.35 for the entire 9.3390 hectares. 



 Respondent LBP is ordered to pay to petitioners, within 
fifteen 
(15) days from finality of this Decision, the aforesaid amounts, the 
mode of payments of which shall be in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 18, Chapter VI of RA 6657. 


 No pronouncement as to cost. 


 SO ORDERED.
[15]




 Aggrieved, LBP interposed a petition for review with the CA,
 
asserting that in fixing the amount of just compensation for the subject
 property at P267,907.83, the RTC violated the formula for valuation as 
stated in DAR Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 5, series of 1998, in 
connection with Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657. 
 The CA,
 however, 
did not find any merit in LBP's argument. In its herein assailed 
decision, the appellate court ruled that the formula set forth by DAR 
for the computation of just compensation is not mandatory; the courts 
may, in the exercise of judicial discretion, set it aside. Moreover, the
 CA found credence in the trial court's evaluation of the subject 
property's location, land use and current sale value of the nearby 
properties as important factors to be appreciated in arriving at its 
fair market value. The CA thus decreed: 
  


 ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The
 
Consolidated Decision dated 18 October 2005 of the court a quo is 
AFFIRMED insofar as the valuation of Lot No. 2493 is concerned. 



 SO ORDERED.
[16]




 LBP moved for reconsideration of the foregoing decision, 
which the
 CA denied in its herein assailed resolution dated July 14, 2011. 

 Hence, the present recourse. 
 
Issue


 This Court is now tasked with resolving whether or
 not the CA erred in affirming the Decision of the RTC. 
 
Ruling of the Court


 The concept of just compensation was defined by 
this Court in 
Land Bank of the Philippines v. American Rubber 
Corp
.
[17]
 in the following manner: 
  


 This Court has defined "just compensation" for parcels of 
land 
taken pursuant to the agrarian reform program as "the full and fair 
equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator." 
The measure of compensation is not the taker's gain but the owner's 
loss. Just compensation means the equivalent for the value of the 
property at the time of its taking. It means a fair and full equivalent 
value for the loss sustained. All the facts as to the condition of the 
property and its surroundings, its improvements and capabilities should 
be considered.
[18]






 In setting the valuation of just compensation for lands that
 are 
covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, as amended, 
Section 17 thereof provides for the guideposts that must be observed 
therefor, 
viz
.: 
  


 SECTION 17. Determination of Just Compensation. â In 
determining
 just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current 
value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn 
valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by
 government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic 
benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the 
Government to the property as well as the nonÂ­ payment of taxes or loans
 secured from any government financing institution on the said land 
shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation. 





 Succinctly, the factors enumerated under the foregoing 
provision 
are: (a) the acquisition cost of the land, (b) the current value of like
 properties, (c) the nature and actual use of the property, and the 
income therefrom, (d) the owner's sworn valuation, (e) the tax 
declarations, (j)  the assessment made by government assessors, (g) the 
social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the 
farmworkers, and by the government to the property, and (b) the nonÂ­ 
payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing 
institution on the said land, if any, must be equally considered.
[19]
 
In 
Alfonso v. Land Bank of the Philippines, et 
al.
,
[20]

 the Court emphatically made the following pronouncement:
  


 For clarity, we restate the body of rules as follows: The 
factors listed under Section 17 of RA 6657 and its resulting formulas 
provide a uniform framework or structure for the computation of just 
compensation which ensures that the amounts to be paid to affected 
landowners are not arbitrary, absurd or even contradictory to the 
objectives of agrarian reform. Until and unless declared invalid in a 
proper case, the DAR formulas partake of the nature of statutes, which 
under the 2009 amendment became law itself, and thus have in their favor
 the presumption of legality, such that courts shall consider, and not 
disregard, these formulas in the determination of just compensation for 
properties covered by the CARP. When faced with situations which do not 
warrant the formula's strict application, courts may, in the exercise of
 their judicial discretion, relax the formula's application to fit the 
factual situations before them, subject only to the condition that they 
clearly explain in their Decision their reasons (as borne by the 
evidence on record) for the deviation undertaken. It is thus entirely 
allowable for a court to allow a landowner's claim for an amount higher 
than what would otherwise have been offered (based on an application of 
the formula) for as long as there is evidence on record sufficient to 
support the award.


 x x x x 


 For the guidance of the bench, the bar, and the public, we
 
reiterate the rule: Out of regard for the DAR's expertise as the 
concerned implementing agency, courts should henceforth consider the 
factors stated in Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, as translated into 
the applicable DAR formulas in their determination of just compensation 
for the properties covered by the said law. If, in the exercise of their
 judicial discretion, courts find that a strict application of said 
formulas is not warranted under the specific circumstances of the case 
before them, they may deviate or depart therefrom, provided that this 
departure or deviation is supported by a reasoned explanation grounded 
on the evidence on record. In other words, courts of law possess the 
power to make a final determination of just compensation.
[21]




 Veritably, the courts are not at liberty to deviate from the
 DAR 
basic formula, unless such deviations are amply supported by facts and 
reasoned justification.
[22]
 This formula, as stated in DAR A.O. No. 5, 
series of 1998, is as follows:
  






LV= (CNI x 0.60) + (CS x 0.30) + (MV x 
0.10) 






 


 


 






Where:


 


 






 


LV


= Land Value






 


CNI


 = Capitalized Net Income






 


CS


= Comparable Sales






 


MV


=Market Value per Tax Declaration 








The above-stated formula shall be used only if all the three 
factors, 
i.e
.,
 CNI, CS, and MV, are present, relevant, and applicable. In case one or 
two factors are not present, the said A.O. provides for alternate 
formulas.
[23]
 In 
the instant case, the parties resorted to the alternate formula of: LV= 
MV x 2.


 Following a thorough examination of the records, this Court 
finds 
that the RTC did not consider all of the factors enumerated in Section 
17 of R.A. No. 6657. In the same vein, the LBP's valuation also failed 
to take into account all of the factors enumerated in the said 
provision. It also failed to adduce any competent evidence to support 
its valuation.
 Accordingly, in accordance with this 
Court's ruling in 
Alfonso
,
 a remand of this case for reception of further evidence is necessary in
 order for the trial court, acting as a special agrarian court, to 
determine just compensation pursuant to Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and 
the applicable DAR regulations.
[24]


WHEREFORE
,
 the Decision dated November 	10, 2010 and the Resolution dated July 14,
 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 01431 are hereby 

REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Civil Case
 No. 1514 is 
REMANDED

 to the Regional Trial Court of Tandag, Surigao del Sur, Branch 27, for 
reception of evidence on the issue of just compensation in accordance 
with this ruling.
