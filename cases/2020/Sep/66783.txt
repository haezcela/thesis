DELOS SANTOS, J.:


The Case


 Before the Court is a Letter-Complaint
[1]
 dated August 24, 2009 filed by complainant Atty. Esther Gertrude D. Biliran
[2]

 (complainant) against respondent Atty. Danilo A. Bantugan (Atty. 
Bantugan) for violation of Rule 1.01 and Rule 7.03 of the Code of 
Professional Responsibility (CPR) for alleged misuse of funds and 
property. In a Report and Recommendation
[3]

 dated September 1, 2016, Investigating Commissioner Rico A. Limpingco 
(Investigating Commissioner) recommended the dismissal of the complaint 
without prejudice to its re-filing with sufficient evidence. In a 
Resolution
[4]
 dated March 1, 
2017, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Board of Governors 	
(IBP-BOG) reversed the findings of the Investigating Commissioner and 
recommended the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for two 
years.  
  




The Facts


Complainant is a member of the IBP-Bohol 
Chapter (IBP-Bohol). On September 14, 2009, she filed a Letter-Complaint
 before the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) charging respondent 
Atty. Bantugan with misuse of funds and property of the Legal Assistance
 for Effective Law Enforcement Program (LAELEP) and claiming that the 
IBP-Bohol failed to file the appropriate criminal and/or administrative 
action against Atty. Bantugan.
      




 Atty. Bantugan is a member of the IBP-Bohol and LAELEP. LAELEP 
is a joint project of the Provincial Government of Bohol and the 
IBP-Bohol aimed at assisting police officers in the performance of their
 functions through litigation and education.
[5]
 Subsequently, this project was extended to benefit 
barangay tanods

 , firemen, jail officers, and provincial jail guards. The provincial 
government provides for the funds while the IBP-Bohol implements the 
project.
 On April 19 and 20, 2002, the LAELEP held live-in 
seminars which incurred expenses for food and accommodation. Complainant
 alleged that Atty. Bantugan took a check payable to cash in the amount 
of P27,500.00 from LAELEP/IBP-Bohol staff which was intended for JJ's 
Seafood Village as payment. Atty. Bantugan undertook to pay the 
establishment and such payment was recorded in LAELEP's accounting books
 as paid. However, no payment was effected and demands were made by the 
owner of JJ's Seafood Village. Thus, during the succeeding 
administration of IBP-Bohol (2005-2007), a Special Committee
[6]
 was formed to investigate LAELEP and Atty. Bantugan, and make recommendations therefor.
 On December 19, 2006, the Special Committee recommended "
the filing of administrative, civil and/or criminal action to the person/persons concerned, if evidence so warrants
." 
[7]

 During the course of their investigation, the Special Committee 
discovered that in addition to the non-payment to JJ's Seafood Village, 
there were other instances of misappropriation which involved Atty. 
Bantugan. For reference, the Special Committee's Final 
Report/Recommendation
[8]
 is quoted as follows: 
    






1.


COMBAT PAY DEDUCTIONS






 


 








The committee believes that all money
 collected is a public fund hence, there must be a proper liquidation to
 be prepared and submitted to the LAELEP Office. 






 


 






2.


BALANCE IN JJ'S [SEAFOOD VILLAGE] 






 


 








Although the account is now fully 
paid but we cannot comprehend why personal checks [were] issued and 
eventually dishonored by the bank. Payment was only effected after the 
investigation was conducted and upon demands made by the restaurant 
owner.






 


 






3.


PNP HANDBOOK






 


 








We found out that this was fully paid
 on December 03, 2002 and until now, the PNP [H]andbook is not yet 
delivered. Presently, the draft is under proof reading by Atty. 
Cristifil Baluma, who promised to complete the job by early [January of]
 2007.






 


 






4.


LAPTOP






 


 








 
The [laptop] was borrowed by Atty. 
Danilo A. Bantugan on December I5, 2005 and returned on October 31, 2006
 after written and oral demands were made by the Investigating 
Committee. 






 


 






 


The Committee recommends that any property of the LAELEP 
before it can be taken out by any borrower should accomplish a 
borrower's card indicating the date it was borrowed and the date to be 
returned which must not exceed two days and must be duly approved by the
 IBP President countersigned by the LAELEP Chairman. 






 


 






5.


TRIP TO SINGAPORE






 


 








 
The Committee believes that this 
expenditure must also be subject to liquidation, as this also involves 
public funds. During the IBP Board Meeting on Sept. 14, 2006, Atty. 
Danilo Bantugan committed to submit documents to support the liquidation
 but until now, he has not yet complied.








Despite these findings, complainant claimed that the succeeding 
administrations of IBP-Bohol ignored the Special Committee's 
recommendation to file charges against Atty. Bantugan. In view of the 
aforementioned acts, complainant charged Atty. Bantugan for violating 
the CPR, in particular, Rule 1.01
[9]
 for engaging in unlawful, dishonest, or deceitful conduct, as well as Rule 7.03
[10]
 for engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.


 The OCA endorsed the Letter-Complaint to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) for whatever action it deemed appropriate.
[11]
 The Court directed the IBP-Bohol and Atty. Bantugan to file their respective Comments.
[12]

 Considering the seriousness of the allegations imputed against Atty. 
Bantugan, the OBC recommended that the case be referred to the 
IBP-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) for investigation and 
recommendation.
[13]
 Meanwhile, receipt of evidence for the case was delegated to the President of IBP-Bohol.
    
 In his Comment
[14]
 and Position Paper,
[15]

 Atty. Bantugan denied the charges against him. He stated that he was a 
City Councilor of Tagbilaran City, Bohol from 2001-2010; during which 
time he concurrently held the following positions in LAELEP: (a) 
technical committee member from 2001-2003; (b) pioneer committee member 
from 2003-2005; and (c) committee member from 2005-2007 and 2007-2009. 
As regards the alleged misuse of LAELEP funds, he claims that this issue
 was pursued by then IBP-Bohol President Atty. Salvador Diputado 
(2005-2007) as an election issue because he was seeking a seat in the 
Provincial Board of Bohol and campaigned for Atty. Antonio Amora, Jr., 
who was a rival candidate of Atty. Diputado in the IBP-Bohol elections. 
He claimed that complainant could have submitted this purported issue to
 the Supreme Court as early as 2002 or thereabouts, yet sent the 
Letter-Complaint not long after he acted as legal counsel for one 
Nemesio Barafon
[16]
 in filing a
 Complaint for disbarment against complainant in 2009. In fine, he 
averred that the filing of the Letter-Complaint was an act of 
retaliation and a form of barratry on the part of complainant.
    
 Further, Atty. Bantugan alleged that the accountability for 
LAELEP funds is to the Provincial Government of Bohol. He underscored 
that had there been anything irregular or unliquidated, the provincial 
government would not have regularly and continuously released funds 
since 2002. As regards the Philippine National Police (PNP) combat pay, 
he claims that the Special Committee ignored the affidavit of PNP 
Provincial Director Superintendent Sancho Bernales which he submitted to
 them for consideration, which attested to the following facts: (1) he 
was designated as a Training Director and conducted a series of 
trainings; (2) he was tasked to manage the expenditures from the 
trainings, with the approval of the PNP Provincial Director; (3) to 
support the trainings, the PNP consented to a deduction from their 
personnel's combat pay, and thus, these money was purely a PNP Fund; and
 (4) he recommended that the excess combat pay deductions be given to 
LAELEP. With regard to the non-payment to JJ's Seafood Village, he 
claimed that he had a separate account with the establishment which was 
co-mingled by the Special Committee. As regards the trip to Singapore, 
he stated that he was one of the members of the IBP-Bohol delegation and
 questioned why he was singled out when the trip was fully documented 
and liquidated to the provincial government. As to the laptop, he denied
 possession of the same.
    
 In its Comment
[17]

 the IBP-Bohol averred that contrary to complainant's claim, its 
previous administrations had acted upon the investigation involving 
Atty. Bantugan. The IBP-Bohol Board of Officers for 2009-2011 adopted 
Resolution No. 17, Series of 2009
[18]

 which endorsed the Special Committee's Final Report/Recommendation to 
the Provincial Government of Bohol for action under the premise that the
 funds allegedly misused were government funds. Likewise, the IBP-Bohol 
Board of Officers for 2011-2013 issued Resolution No. 5, Series of 2011
[19]

 following up on the investigation conducted by the provincial 
government and requesting a copy of the results of the audit. However, 
no definite action was taken by the provincial government. The present 
administration of IBP-Bohol adopted the position of its previous 
administrations to the effect that it is the provincial government who 
should file the proper charges. In consideration, however, of the fact 
that IBP-CBD now possessed the records of the case, the IBP-Bohol 
submitted the resolution of the investigation on Atty. Bantugan to its 
sound judgment.
    




Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner
 






In his Report and Recommendation
[20]

 dated September 1, 2016, the Investigating Commissioner recommended the
 dismissal of the complaint without prejudice to its re-filing with 
supporting evidence. After examining the records of the case, he found 
that complainant failed to meet the quantum of proof of preponderance of
 evidence before Atty. Bantugan could be held administratively liable. 
He determined that the Special Committee's Final Report/Recommendation 
and the Minutes of the Joint Meeting of the IBP-Bohol Board of Officers 
and LAELEP, unsupported by documentary or any other evidence, cannot 
sustain a finding of misconduct. In fine, while the accusations against 
Atty. Bantugan portrayed him in a negative light, these were unfounded. 
Finally, the Investigating Commissioner underscored that while the 
IBP-BOG requested the submission of affidavits of the members of the 
Special Committee, relevant witnesses whom the Special Committee 
obtained evidence from or those with personal knowledge of the facts, as
 well as supporting documents as to the acts attributed to Atty. 
Bantugan, these were not complied with despite receipt of evidence for 
both parties being delegated to the current President of IBP-Bohol.
    
 
Recommendation of the IBP-BOG


 On March 1, 2017, the IBP-BOG issued Resolution No. XXII-2017-839,
[21]
 which reversed the recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner, thus:
    


 RESOLVED to REVERSE the recommendations of the Investigating 
Commissioner and IMPOSE the penalty of SUSPENSION from the practice of 
law for two (2) years.


 RESOLVED FURTHER, to direct CIBD Assistant Director Juan 
Orendain P. Buted to prepare an extended resolution explaining the 
Board's action. 




 In its Extended Resolution
[22]

 dated July 5, 2018, the IBP-BOG ratiocinated that Atty. Bantugan was 
administratively liable for violation of Rules 1.01 and 7.03 of the CPR 
for the following reasons: (a) he acted with dishonesty when he failed 
to deliver the check for payment to JJ's Seafood Village for food and 
accommodation expenses and thereafter, attempted to pay the same by the 
issuance of a personal check which was subsequently dishonored; (b) he 
failed to contest substantially the allegations of misappropriation of 
funds pertaining to the PNP combat pay deduction, unliquidated checks, 
PNP Handbook, trip to Singapore, and his failure to return a laptop to 
IBP-Bohol; and (c) he failed to uphold the integrity and dignity of the 
legal profession and discredited the IBP-Bohol when the aforementioned 
acts were publicized in two local newspapers in Tagbilaran City. 
 On September 21, 2018, Atty. Bantugan filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[23]
 and a Second Motion for Reconsideration with Leave to Admit Delayed Pleadings
[24]
 dated September 30, 2019, both of which were opposed by complainant. 
 On December 6, 2018, the IBP-BOG issued a Resolution
[25]

 denying the Motion for Reconsideration for failure to raise new matters
 which would otherwise convince the IBP-BOG to reverse its earlier 
ruling. 
 
The Issue


 The essential issue in this case is whether Atty. Bantugan 
should be held administratively liable for violating Rules 1.01 and 7.03
 of the CPR. 
 
The Court's Ruling


 The Court adopts the findings and recommendation of the 
Investigating Commissioner to dismiss the complaint against Atty. 
Bantugan, without prejudice to its re-filing with sufficient evidence. 

 At the onset, it bears to emphasize that the quantum of proof in 
administrative cases against members of the legal profession is 
substantial evidence, and not preponderance of evidence as stated by 
both the Investigating Commissioner and the IBP-BOG. This matter has 
been settled in the case of 
Reyes v. Atty. Nieva
,
[26]
 thus: 
    


 
Besides, the evidentiary threshold of substantial evidence - as opposed to preponderance of evidence
 - 
is
 more in keeping with the primordial purpose of and essential 
considerations attending this type of cases. As case law elucidates, 
"[d]isciplinary proceedings against lawyers are 
sui generis.
"
 Neither purely civil nor purely criminal, they do not involve a trial 
of an action or a suit, but is rather an investigation by the Court into
 the conduct of one of its officers. Not being intended to inflict 
punishment, it is in no sense a criminal prosecution. Accordingly, there
 is neither a plaintiff nor a prosecutor therein. It may be initiated by
 the Court 
motu proprio
. 
Public interest is its primary 
objective, and the real question for determination is whether or not the
 attorney is still a fit person to be allowed the privileges as such.
 x x x (Emphases supplied) 




 This was the same conclusion in the recent case of 
Spouses Nocuenca v. Atty. Bensi
,
[27]
 further citing 
Reyes 
and 
Dela Fuente Torres v. Dalangin
[28]

 which stated that substantial evidence, or "that amount of relevant 
evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a 
conclusion" is the evidentiary threshold in administrative cases.

 In this case, Atty. Bantugan was charged with violations of Rules 1.01 
and 7.03 of the CPR which stemmed from his alleged misuse of LAELEP 
funds and property. According to the Special Committee, Atty. Bantugan 
committed the following acts:
[29]

 (1) received P150,000.00 as combat pay fee deductions; (2) paid 
LAELEP's obligation with JJ 's Seafood Village with the issuance of a 
personal check which was dishonored, but now fully satisfied; (3) failed
 to liquidate a total amount of P197,960.00 consisting of two checks in 
his name for a trip to Singapore; (4) based on oral information from 
different personalities, Atty. Bantugan was in prolonged possession of a
 laptop belonging to IBP-Bohol; and (5) unduly retained possession of 
the PNP Handbook whose reproduction was forestalled despite full 
payment. The alleged commission of these acts were primarily established
 by the complainant through the presentation of the Special Committee's 
Final Report/Recommendation and Minutes of the Joint Meeting by the IBP 
Board of Officers and the LAELEP. It bears to note however that the 
aforementioned acts were not supported by any other evidence, 
documentary or otherwise. 
 In administrative proceedings, the 
burden of proof lies upon the complainant. For the Court to exercise its
 disciplinary powers, the case against a respondent must be established 
by convincing and satisfactory proof.
[30]

 As aptly found by the Investigating Commissioner, the evidence 
presented by complainant does not sufficiently establish the facts from 
which her Letter-Complaint is based, to wit: 
    


 Scrutiny of the records of this case show that while the 
minutes of IBP Bohol Chapter meetings and the final report of the 
Special Committee, which paint an unflattering portrait of Atty. 
Bantugan and concluded that he is guilty of the fiscal misdeeds 
attributed to him, were indeed forwarded to the IBP-CBD, there is an 
unfortunate absence of evidence to support these findings. 
There is 
not a single dishonored check, demand letter, or any kind of documentary
 or other evidence to buttress the finding of the Special Committee that
 respondent Atty. Bantugan had failed to make a proper accounting or 
liquidation of funds, refused to return LAELEP equipment, appropriated 
for his personal use a check intended for payment to a restaurant, etc.
[31]
 (Underscoring supplied)




 The Court finds no cogent reason to depart from this finding 
considering that our own review of the records of the case leads us to 
the same conclusion. The Special Committee's Final Report/Recommendation
[32]
 and the Minutes of the Joint Meetings of the IBP Board of Officers and the LAELEP Special Committee dated January 15, 2007
[33]
 and January 23, 2007
[34]

 alone cannot substantiate complainant's allegations of misappropriation
 against Atty. Bantugan. The Special Committee's Final 
Report/Recommendation does not cite any basis for its findings and 
conclusions, considering the fact that what is involved in this 
controversy are dishonored checks, demands for payment, liquidation, and
 accounting. Moreover, in the Court's assessment, a plain reading of the
 Minutes of the Joint Meetings even weaken the case of complainant. In 
response to a query as to why the Special Committee's recommendation was
 to file an administrative, civil and/or criminal action, but qualified 
it with the statement, "
if evidence so warrants
;" a member of the
 Special Committee replied that they were not making a conclusion on the
 investigation, but were leaving it to the Board to decide.
[35]

 Similarly, the Special Committee also refrained from giving a 
categorical assessment on the sufficiency of the evidence on hand to 
substantiate Atty. Bantugan's misconduct.
[36]

 The paucity of the evidence against Atty. Bantugan is further 
underscored by the fact that IBP-BOG requested the submission of 
affidavits by the members of the Special Committee and all the other 
relevant witnesses which the Special Committee may have received 
evidence from, or who may have personal knowledge of the facts, as well 
as supporting documents relating to the acts attributed to Atty. 
Bantugan.
[37]
 Records show 
that the reception of evidence for this disciplinary case was referred 
to the President of IBP-Bohol; hence, the convenience in obtaining these
 documents yet for some reasons, this was not accomplished.
[38]

 Lastly, it bears pointing out that complainant was neither a member of 
the IBP Board of Officers or LAELEP, nor does she appear to have 
attended the Joint Meetings to provide insight as to the deliberations 
of its members and the context of their statements. Otherwise stated, 
she has no personal knowledge of the facts relating to Atty. Bantugan's 
alleged misuse of LAELEP funds and the investigation conducted, save 
from what she gleaned from the Final Report/Recommendation of the 
Special Committee and the Minutes of the Joint Meetings between the IBP 
Board of Officers and the LAELEP. 
 The burden of proof in 
disbarment and suspension proceedings always rests on the complainant. 
While administrative cases call for the lowest standard of proof, it 
cannot be overemphasized that mere allegation is not evidence, nor is it
 equivalent to proof.
[39]
 The Court's disquisitions, in the case of 
BSA Tower Condominium Corporation v. Atty. Reyes II
[40]
 is instructive:
    


 
The Court has consistently held that an attorney enjoys the
 legal presumption that he is innocent of the charges against him until 
the contrary is proved
, and that as an officer of the court, he is 
presumed to have performed his duties in accordance with his oath. 
Burden of proof, on the other hand, is defined in Section 1 of Rule 131 
as the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue 
necessary to establish his claim or defense by the amount evidence 
required by law. 


 In administrative proceedings, the quantum of proof necessary 
for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, which is that amount of 
relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion. Further, 
the complainant has the burden of 
proving by substantial evidence the allegations in his complaint. The 
basic rule is that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent
 to proof. 
Likewise, charges based on mere suspicion and speculation cannot be given credence. (Emphases supplied) 




 A member of the Bar may be so removed or suspended from office 
as an attorney for any deceit, malpractice or misconduct in his office.
[41]

 The word "conduct" used in the rules is not limited to conduct 
exhibited in connection with the performance of the lawyers' 
professional duties, but it also refers to any misconduct, although not 
connected with his professional duties that would show him to be unfit 
for the office and unworthy of the privileges from which his license and
 the law confer upon him.
[42]
 
Thus, lawyers must conduct themselves beyond reproach at all times, 
whether they are dealing with their clients or the public at-large, and a
 violation of the high moral standards of the legal profession justifies
 the imposition of the appropriate penalty, including suspension and 
disbarment.
[43]
 	It cannot be 
gainsaid that the accusations against Atty. Bantugan certainly portray 
him in a negative light. Neither can his defenses be characterized as 
sufficient to wholly exculpate him from any liability insofar as he 
primarily proffered the defenses 	of 	denial, 	ill 	motive 	on 	the 	
part 	of 	complainant, 	mere mismanagement of his affairs insofar as the
 matter of issuance of a personal check for the balance of JJ's Seafood 
Village is concerned and finally, as proof of his proper accounting and 
non-misuse of funds, the continued release by the provincial government 
of funding for LAELEP's projects. However, under the circumstances of 
this case, the Court finds that the weakness of Atty. Bantugan to 
substantially contest the charges against him does not evince his guilt 
as to warrant the imposition of disciplinary action. 
 It has been
 held that charges meriting disciplinary action against a member of the 
Bar generally involve the motives that induced him to commit the acts or
 acts charged, and that, to justify disbarment or suspension, the case 
against him must be clear and free from doubt, not only as to the acts 
charged, but as to his motive.
[44]

 As punishment by disbarment or suspension will deeply affect a lawyer's
 professional life, neither should be imposed unless the case against 
him is free from doubt not only as to the acts charged, but as to his 
motive.
[45]
 Taking together 
the plausibility of the defenses put forth by Atty. Bantugan coupled 
with the absence of any substantial evidence as to characterize his acts
 as willful and committed with wrongful intent, the Court cannot 
discount the possibility that these stem from a mere error of judgment. 
Indeed, while the Court will not hesitate to mete out the proper 
disciplinary punishment upon lawyers who have failed to live up to their
 sworn duties, neither will it hesitate to extend its protective arm to 
them when the accusation against them is not indubitably proven.
[46]
 

 Except for complainant's allegations, she failed to present sufficient 
evidence to substantiate the allegations in her Letter-Complaint. The 
standard of substantial evidence is satisfied when there is reasonable 
ground to believe, based on the evidence submitted, that Atty. Bantugan 
is responsible for the misconduct complained of. It need not be 
overwhelming or preponderant, as is required in an ordinary civil case 
or evidence beyond reasonable doubt as is required in criminal cases, 
but the evidence must be enough for a reasonable mind to support a 
conclusion. Here, the Court is not satisfied that the evidence presented
 by complainant has met this threshold as to hold Atty. Bantugan 
administratively liable and for this reason, dismisses the complaint 
against him. The Court, however, must clarify that its ruling is limited
 to the sufficiency of the evidence presented against Atty. Bantugan and
 is not a final pronouncement as to his innocence of the charges imputed
 against him.
