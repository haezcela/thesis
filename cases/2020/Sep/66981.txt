THIRD DIVISION

CARGILL PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.


D E C I S I O N




LEONEN, J.:


Two conditions must be met for the most favored nation clause to apply: (1) similarity in subject matter,
 i.e
. that royalties derived from the Philippines by a resident of the United States and of the third state are of the same kind;
[1]
 and (2) similarity in circumstances in the payment of tax, 
i.e
. the same mechanism must be employed by the United States and the third state in mitigating the effects of double taxation.
[2]
 Failure to meet these conditions means the clause cannot apply.
  
 This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[3]
 assailing the Decision
[4]
 and Resolution
[5]
 of the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
,
 which denied Cargill Philippines, Inc.'s (Cargill) claim for refund or 
tax credit worth P8,771,270.71, supposedly representing the erroneously 
paid withholding taxes on royalties from June 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007.
 The Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 upheld the First Division's Decision
[6]
 and Resolution,
[7]

 holding that BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 is not binding because the 
RP-Czech and RP-US tax treaties do not grant similar tax reliefs on 
royalty payments in violation of the most favored nation clause.
  
 Cargill is a domestic corporation primarily engaged in trading
 commodities such as copra products, soybeans, and wheat, and in the 
manufacturing of animal feeds and coconut oil.
[8]
 

 On June 1, 2002, Cargill entered into an Intellectual Property License 
Agreement with United States company CAN Technologies, Inc.
[9]

 (CAN Technologies). The Agreement granted Cargill a "non-exclusive, 
royaltyÂ­ bearing, and non-transferable license" to use CAN Technologies'
 patent, technology, and copyrights "to produce, market, distribute, 
sell, use and supply animal feeds in the Philippines."
[10]

 In turn, Cargill would pay CAN Technologies a royalty fee equivalent to
 1.25% of its net sales and 5.25% of its consulting revenues.
[11]

 From June 1, 2005 to April 2007, Cargill allegedly paid CAN 
Technologies P175,425,414.12 as royalties, less withholding final taxes 
at the rate of 15%, or P26,313,812.10.
[12]
 

 On December 21, 2005, Cargill wrote the Bureau of Internal Revenue, 
requesting confirmation that the royalties it had paid CAN Technologies 
were subject to the preferential tax rate of 10% in accordance with the 
"most favored nation" clause of the RP-US Tax Treaty, in relation to the
 RP-Bahrain Tax Treaty.
[13]

 In reply, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued BIR Ruling No. DAÂ­ ITAD
 60-07 on May 11, 2007, confirming that a 10% tax rate may be applied to
 the royalties Cargill had paid CAN Technologies since January 1, 2004. 
It did clarify that this was not due to the RP-Bahrain Tax Treaty, which
 was inapplicable, but Article 12
[14]
 of the RP-Czech Tax Treaty, m relation to Article 13
[15]
 of the RP-US Tax Treaty.
[16]

 Thus, on July 10, 2007, Cargill filed on behalf of CAN Technologies a 
claim for refund of P8,771,270.71, which it alleged to be the overpaid 
withholding tax on royalty payments. On the same date, Cargill also 
filed a Petition before the Court of Tax Appeals, though later submitted
 an amended Petition.
[17]
 On September 6, 2010, the Court of Tax Appeals First Division dismissed
[18]

 the Petition for insufficiency of evidence. It held that Cargill failed
 to show that the taxes imposed on royalties in the RP-US and RP-Czech 
tax treaties were "paid under similar circumstances" or that the tax 
reliefs granted to United States residents under the RP-US Tax Treaty, 
with respect to taxes imposable upon royalties earned from sources 
within the Philippines, were similar to those allowed to Czech residents
 under the RP-Czech Tax Treaty.
[19]
 

   The First Division noted that since Cargill failed to present the 
relevant provisions of the United States law, it cannot be determined 
for certain whether the limitation on tax credit under the United States
 Law was similar to that under the RP-Czech Tax Treaty.
[20]

 The First Division found BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 infirm in 
allowing Cargill to apply the 10% preferential tax rate on royalties. It
 held that the BIR Ruling merely cited the relevant provisions of the 
tax treaties without explaining how the mechanisms employed by the 
United States and Czech Republic to mitigate the effects of double 
taxation are the same.
[21]

 On September 23, 2010, Cargill filed an Omnibus Motion for 
Reconsideration and To Reopen the Case for Presentation of Additional 
Evidence.
[22]
 In its February 15, 2011 Resolution,
[23]
 the Court of Tax Appeals First Division denied the Omnibus Motion. Citing 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. S.C. Johnson and Son, Inc
.,
[24]

 it explained that the most favored nation clause aims to grant 
"equality of international treatment," which entails that the tax burden
 laid on the investor's income be the "
same
" in the two 
countries. To determine whether there is equality of treatment, the 
limitations of credit on foreign taxes under the United States Law in 
relation to Article 23(1) of the RP-US Tax Treaty must be compared with 
the limitation in Article 22 of the RP-Czech Tax Treaty.
[25]

 As such, Cargill's failure to present the United States Law was deemed 
fatal to its refund claim. The First Division also reiterated that it 
was not bound by the BIR Ruling, it being "judicially found to be 
erroneous."
[26]
 On March 25, 2011, Cargill filed its Petition for Review before the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
.
[27]
 In a May 24, 2012 Decision,
[28]
 the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc

 dismissed the Petition. It held that Cargill may not avail of the lower
 10% tax rate for its failure to comply with the requirements of the 
most favored nation clause embodied in 
S.C. Johnson
, 
particularly, its failure to show similarity in the circumstances in the
 payment of taxes on royalties under the two treaties. It also sustained
 the First Division's holding that BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 cannot 
be given weight.
[29]
 Cargill's Motion for Reconsideration was likewise denied in an August 30, 2012 Resolution.
[30]
 Rejecting the argument on its lack of jurisdiction to reverse BIR rulings, the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc

 reasoned that it may pass upon the issue of the validity of an 
administrative ruling or regulation if raised in refund or assessment 
cases or other cases where it has jurisdiction.
[31]

 Hence, Cargill filed this Petition. In turn, the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a 
Comment.
[32]
 Cargill subsequently filed its Reply.
[33]

 Petitioner submits that BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 had confirmed the 
applicability of the 10% preferential tax rate on the royalties payable 
by petitioner to CAN Technologies, pursuant to the RP-Czech Tax Treaty 
in relation to the most favored nation clause of the RP-US Tax Treaty.
[34]

 It adds that, contrary to the holding of the First Division, the BIR 
Ruling exhaustively explained why the most favored nation rate was 
applicable,
[35]
 and the ruling was arrived at after the Commissioner had considered	all the appropriate laws,
[36]
 supporting documents, and information
[37]
 submitted by petitioner.
 Petitioner contends that the BIR Ruling determined that the two conditions laid down in 
S.C. Johnson
 for the most favored nation clause to apply were met.
[38]

 These conditions were: (1) that royalties derived by a resident of the 
United States and of Czech Republic are of the same kind;
[39]

 and (2) that the same mechanism must be employed by the United States 
and Czech Republic in mitigating the effects of double taxation.
[40]

 Petitioner further stresses that before and after BIR Ruling No. 
DA-ITAD-60-07, the Bureau of Internal Revenue had issued several rulings
 with the same conclusion.
[41]
 These rulings were presumably supported by factual and legal bases, and petitioner argues that these must be respected.
[42]
 Moreover, petitioner submits that the Court of Tax Appeals had no jurisdiction to reverse BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD-60-07.
[43]
 It invokes 
British American Tobacco v. Camacho
,
[44]

 which had ruled that the Court of Tax Appeals' jurisdiction does not 
include cases where the constitutionality of a law or rule is 
challenged. It submits that the BIR Ruling remains valid until the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the regular courts revoke it.
[45]
 Neither can it be attacked collaterally in the present tax refund case.
[46]

 Even if BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD-60-07 were invalid, petitioner contends 
that such invalidity cannot be applied retroactively to its prejudice.
[47]
 Petitioner then argues that the preferential 10% tax rate would still apply despite certain dissimilarities.
[48]
 For one, even if the RP-Czech Tax Treaty allows tax credit to a 
resident
, while the RP-US Tax Treaty allows tax credit to a 
resident and citizen
,
 the most favored nation clause still applies. What is important is that
 residents of both states are entitled to the similar tax reliefs for 
taxes paid in the Philippines.
[49]
 Similarly, even if the RP-Czech Tax Treaty allows tax credit on royalties 
paid
 in the Philippines, while the RP-US Tax Treaty allows tax credit on royalties 
paid or accrued
 in the Philippines, the clause would still apply.
[50]


 Petitioner also submits that a reference to United States laws is not necessary for the most favored nation clause to apply.
[51]
 It adds that in 
S.C. Johnson
,
 this Court did not consider the domestic laws of the United States and 
Germany in determining if the taxes are "paid under similar 
circumstances."
[52]
 In that 
case, asserts petitioner, the tax credit allowed under the RP-US and 
RP-Germany tax treaties were considered, and not the tax credit 
ultimately granted under each country's domestic law.
[53]


 Petitioner adds that "since the . . . royalties involved refer
 to royalties in the Philippines, the taxes on royalties referred to . .
 . pertains to the taxes paid in the Philippines based on the treaties 
and not the taxes paid in the country where the recipient of the royalty
 income is a resident."
[54]
 Petitioner submits that: 
  


 . . . the taxes on royalties under both the RP-US Tax Treaty and
 the RP-Czech Tax Treaty are paid under similar circumstances, 
considering that the taxes paid on such royalties in the Philippines are
 allowed as tax credit from the tax due on such income imposed in the 
United States and on the taxes due on such income imposed in the Czech 
Republic.
[55]




 Finally, petitioner insists on being entitled to the refund of 
P8,771,270.71, the amount it claims to represent the erroneously paid 
final withholding taxes on royalties paid to CAN Technologies.
[56]

 In her Comment, respondent counters that the Court of Tax Appeals has 
jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07, 
as petitioner's claim for refund hinges on this issue.
[57]

 Respondent goes on to claim that the Court of Tax Appeals correctly 
ruled that BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 is not valid because the second 
requirement of the most favored nation clause, per 
S.C. Johnson
, was not met.
[58]

 Petitioner allegedly failed to show similarity in the circumstances in 
the payment of taxes on royalties under the two treaties.
[59]

 Respondent also asserts that petitioner failed to present evidence to 
establish the provisions of the United States law that determines the 
limitation of the amount that may be credited, as referred to in Article
 23(1) of the RP-US Tax Treaty.
[60]
 
 Finally, respondent claims that BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 must be struck down because it goes against the rule in 
S.C. Johnson
 for the most favored nation clause to apply.
[61]
 She maintains that "administrative regulations 'may not enlarge, alter, or restrict the provisions of the law it administers."'
[62]
 

 In its Reply, petitioner reiterates the arguments it raised in its 
Petition. It maintains that even if BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 were 
invalid, the ruling should not be retroactively applied to its 
prejudice.
[63]
 Petitioner further avers that the differences on entities entitled to  credit
[64]

 and on the timing of tax credit recognition do not amount to 
dissimilarities in the circumstances of the payment of the tax, and 
thus, would not render the most favored nation clause inapplicable.
[65]

 It also submits that limitations on tax credit are present in both the 
RP-US Tax Treaty and RP-Czech Tax Treaty. It disagrees with respondent's
 position that reference to domestic laws on the determination of the 
amount of foreign tax credit would result in a dissimilarity in the 
circumstances of the payment of the taxes.
[66]

 Petitioner asserts that limitations on tax credit are common features 
in tax treaties. Citing the OECD Model Tax Convention and its 
commentaries, petitioner avers that a number of treaties usually refer 
to the domestic laws of the contracting states for detailed rules on 
foreign tax credit. This is permissible, adds petitioner, as long as the
 general principle laid down in Article 23B of the OECD Model is not 
altered. The general principle is that the tax credit of foreign income 
taxes imposed on foreign source income is limited to the extent that 
such taxes do not exceed the income tax of the other country on that 
foreign source income.
[67]
 

 Petitioner submits that since both the RP-US and RP-Czech tax treaties 
provide the general principle on limitation on tax credit, there is 
similarity in the circumstances of payment of taxes.
[68]

 There is no need to delve into the details of the United States law, 
which merely concerns the calculation of the limitation on tax credit. 
Petitioner adds that the Philippines had likewise placed similar 
conditions and references to domestic law in the tax treaties.
[69]
 
 Invoking the doctrine of 
processual presumption
,
 petitioner further argues that the United States income tax law is 
presumed to be the same as Philippine tax law. It contends that Section 
904(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code is similar to Section 
34(c)(4) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.
[70]
 

 Finally, petitioner submits that tax treaties are governed by 
international law, and they should be interpreted in good faith in light
 of their object and purpose, pursuant to the general rules of 
interpretation set forth in the Vienna Convention on the Law of 
Treaties. It then asserts that the Court of Tax Appeals' rulingâthat the
 second requisite of the most favored nation clause was not metâwas not 
made in good faith and does not serve the object and purpose of the tax 
treaties. Petitioner argues that such strict construction negates the 
essence of the most favored nation clause, which is to ensure equality 
in international treatment, and the availment of the reliefs provided in
 the tax treaties.
[71]
 For this Court's resolution are the following issues: 

 First, whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to 
determine the validity of BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07. Related to this 
is whether or not the validity of BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 can be 
assailed in the present tax refund case; 
 Second, whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals erred in declaring BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 invalid and not binding; 

 Third, whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals' ruling declaring BIR 
Ruling No. DA-ITAD 60-07 to be invalid can be applied to petitioner; and

 Finally, whether or not petitioner is entitled to a tax refund/credit 
certificate in the amount of P8,771,270.71, representing erroneously 
paid final withholding taxes on royalties paid to CAN Technologies from 
June 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. 
 The Petition is denied. 
 
I


 The Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to review and nullify the rulings of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 

 Under Republic Act No. 1125, or An Act Creating the Court of Tax 
Appeals, as amended by Republic Act No. 9282, the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue's rulings on "other matters arising under the National 
Internal Revenue or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue" are appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals, thus: 
  


 SECTION 7. 
Jurisdiction
. â The CTA shall exercise: 






a.


Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal
, as herein provided:


















1.


Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue

 in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue 
taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other 
matters arising under the National Internal Revenue or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue
[.]








Here, petitioner argues that the Court of Tax Appeals had no 
jurisdiction to reverse or nullify BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD-60-07, citing 
British American Tobacco v. Camacho
,
[72]
 which held: 




 While the above statute confers on the CTA jurisdiction to 
resolve tax 	disputes in 	general, this 	does not 	include 	cases where 
the constitutionality of a law or rule is challenged. 
Where what is 
assailed is the validity or constitutionality of a law, or a rule or 
regulation issued by the administrative agency in the performance of its
 quasi-legislative function, the regular courts have jurisdiction to 
pass upon the same. The determination of whether a specific rule or set 
of rules issued by an administrative agency contravenes the law or the 
constitution is within the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Indeed, 
the Constitution vests the power of judicial review or the power to 
declare a law, treaty, international or executive agreement, 
presidential decree, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation in the
 courts, including the regional trial courts. 
This is within the 
scope of judicial power, which includes the authority of the courts to 
determine in an appropriate action the validity of the acts of the 
political departments. Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of
 justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are 
legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not 
there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess 
of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the 
Government.
[73]
 	(Emphasis supplied)




 We disagree. 
 In 
The City of Manila v. Hon. Grecia-Cuerdo
,
[74]

 this Court recognized that the Court of Tax Appeals possessed all 
inherent powers necessary to the full and effective exercise of its 
appellate jurisdiction over tax cases: 
  


 A grant of appellate jurisdiction implies that there is included
 in it the power necessary to exercise it effectively, to make all 
orders that will preserve the subject of the action, and to give effect 
to the final determination of the appeal. It carries with it the power 
to protect that jurisdiction and to make the decisions of the court 
thereunder effective. The court, in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, 
has authority to control all auxiliary and incidental matters necessary 
to the efficient and proper exercise of that jurisdiction. For this 
purpose, it may, when necessary, prohibit or restrain the performance of
 any act which might interfere with the proper exercise of its rightful 
jurisdiction in cases pending before it. 


 Lastly, it would not be amiss to point out that a court which is
 endowed with a particular jurisdiction should have powers which are 
necessary to enable it to act effectively within such jurisdiction. 
These should be regarded as powers which are inherent in its 
jurisdiction and the court must possess them in order to enforce its 
rules of practice and to suppress any abuses of its process and to 
defeat any attempted thwarting of such process. 


 
In this regard, Section I of RA 9282 states that the CTA 
shall be of the same level as the CA and shall possess all the inherent 
powers of a court of justice. 


 
Indeed, courts possess certain inherent powers which may be 
said to be implied from a general grant of jurisdiction, in addition to 
those expressly conferred on them. These inherent powers are such powers
 as are necessary for the ordinary and efficient exercise of 
jurisdiction; or are essential to the existence, dignity and functions 
of the courts, as well as to the due administration of justice; or are 
directly appropriate, convenient and suitable to the execution of their 
granted powers; and include the power to maintain the court's 
jurisdiction and render it effective in behalf of the litigants. 


 
Thus, this Court has held that "while a court may be 
expressly granted the incidental powers necessary to effectuate its 
jurisdiction, a grant of jurisdiction, in the absence of prohibitive 
legislation, implies the necessary and usual incidental powers essential
 to effectuate it, and, subject to existing laws and constitutional 
provisions, every regularly constituted court has power to do all things
 that are reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within 
the scope of its jurisdiction and for the enforcement of its judgments 
and mandates. "	Hence, demands, matters or questions ancillary or 
incidental to, or growing out of the main action, and coming within the 
above principles, may be taken cognizance of by the court and 
determined, since such jurisdiction is in aid of its authority over the 
principal matter, even though the court may thus be called on to 
consider and decide matters which, as original causes of action, would 
not be within its cognizance
.
[75]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 This Court underscored that the grant of appellate jurisdiction to
 the Court of Tax Appeals includes the power necessary to exercise it 
effectively. Deemed included in its jurisdiction is the authority to 
resolve petitions for certiorari against interlocutory orders of the 
Regional Trial Court in local tax cases.
[76]

 Furthermore, a split jurisdiction between the Court of Tax Appeals and 
the Court of Appeals is "anathema to the orderly administration of 
justice" and could not have been the legislative intent.
[77]
 In 
Banco De Oro v. Republic
,
[78]
 this Court abandoned 
British American Tobacco

 and declared that the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction 
to determine the validity of tax laws, rules and regulations, and other 
administrative issuances of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 
Consistent with 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Leal
,
[79]
 citing 
Rodriguez v. Blaquera
[80]
 and 
Asia International Auctioneers, Inc. v. Hon. Parayno, Jr
.,
[81]
 we recognized the Court of Tax Appeals' broad authority over tax-related cases. Thus: 
  


 
The Court of Tax Appeals has undoubted jurisdiction to pass 
upon the constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation when 
raised by the taxpayer as a defense in disputing or contesting an 
assessment or claiming a refund. It is only in the lawful exercise of 
its power to pass upon all matters brought before it, as sanctioned by 
Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended. 


 
This Court, however, declares that the Court of Tax Appeals 
may likewise take cognizance of cases directly challenging the 
constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation or 
administrative issuance (revenue orders, revenue memorandum circulars, 
rulings).
 


 Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, is explicit 
that, except for local taxes, appeals from the decisions of 
quasi-judicial agencies (Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Commissioner 
of Customs, Secretary of Finance, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, 
Secretary of Trade and Industry) on tax-related problems must be brought
 
exclusively
 to the Court of Tax Appeals. 


 In other words, within the judicial system, the law intends the 
Court of Tax Appeals to have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all tax 
problems. Petitions for writs of certiorari against the acts and 
omissions of the said quasi-judicial agencies should, thus, be filed 
before the Court of Tax Appeals. 


 Republic Act No. 9282, a special and later law than Batas 
Pambansa Blg. 129 provides an exception to the original jurisdiction of 
the Regional Trial Courts over actions questioning the constitutionality
 or validity of tax laws or regulations. Except for local tax cases, 
actions directly challenging the constitutionality or validity of a tax 
law or regulation or administrative issuance may be filed directly 
before the Court of Tax Appeals. 


 Furthermore, with respect to administrative issuances (revenue 
orders, revenue memorandum circulars, or rulings), these are issued by 
the Commissioner under its power to make rulings or opinions in 
connection with the implementation of the provisions of internal revenue
 laws. Tax rulings, on the other hand, are official positions of the 
Bureau on inquiries of taxpayers who request clarification on certain 
provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, other tax laws, or 
their implementing regulations. Hence, the determination of the validity
 of these issuances clearly falls within the exclusive appellate 
jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals under Section 7(1) of Republic 
Act No. 1125, as amended, subject to prior review by the Secretary of 
Finance, as required under Republic Act No. 8424.
[82]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 
Banco de Oro
 stressed that such jurisdiction is exclusively
 vested in the Court of Tax Appeals, whether raised by the taxpayer 
directly or as a defense. 
 Thus, the Court of Tax Appeals has 
jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of BIR Ruling No. DA-ITAD-60-07, 
on which petitioner squarely relied to support its claim for refund. The
 Court of Tax Appeals is not bound by the Bureau of Internal Revenue's 
interpretation or application of treaty provisions when it is found to 
be clearly erroneous. As this Court held: 
  


 Even conceding that the construction of a statute by the CIR is 
to be given great weight, the courts, which include the CTA, are not 
bound thereby if such construction is erroneous or is clearly shown to 
be in conflict with the governing statute or the Constitution or other 
laws. "It is the role of the Judiciary to refine and, when necessary, 
correct constitutional (and/or statutory) interpretation, in the context
 of the interactions of the three branches of the government."
[83]

 II


 The main substantive issue raised in this case involves the 
application of the most favored nation clause under Article 
13(2)(b)(iii) of the RP-US Tax Treaty,
[84]
 a convention between the Philippines and the United States. The provision states: 
 Article 13
 Royalties  






1)


Royalties derived by a 
resident of one of the Contracting States from sources within the other 
Contracting State may be taxed by both Contracting States.






 


 






2)


However, the tax imposed by that Contracting State shall not exceed -






 


 


 








a.


In the case of the United States, 15 percent of the gross amount of the royalties, and








b.


 
In the case of the Philippines, the least of:










i.


25 percent of the gross amount of the royalties; 










ii.


15 percent of the gross amount of the 
royalties, where the royalties are paid by a corporation registered with
 the Philippine Board of Investments and engaged in preferred areas of 
activities; and










iii.


 
The lowest rate of Philippine tax that may be imposed on royalties of the same kind
 
paid under similar circumstances
 to a resident of a third State
. (Emphasis supplied) 








The most favored nation clause speaks of the "
lowest rate of Philippine tax that may be imposed on royalties of the same kind 
paid under similar circumstances
 to a resident of a third State
."
 Therefore, the tax treatment of royalties to a United States entity may
 be taken in relation to other tax treaties that provide a lower tax 
rate on the same type of income. 


 Here, the question is whether petitioner is entitled to the 10% 
preferential tax rate, as provided in Article 12(2)(a) of the RP-Czech 
Tax Treaty,
[85]
 on royalties paid to CAN Technologies, a resident corporation of the United States: 
 Article 12
 Royalties  






1)


Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.






 


 






2)


However, such royalties may
 also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and 
according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the 
royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, 
the tax so charged 
shall not exceed
 â 






 


 


 








a.


10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties

 arising from the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of 
literary, artistic or scientific work, other than that mentioned in 
sub-paragraph (b), any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret 
formula or process, or from the use of, or the right to use, industrial,
 commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning 
industrial, commercial or scientific experience;






 


 


 










. . . . 






 


 








The competent authorities 
of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of 
application of these limitations. (Emphasis supplied) 








In 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. S.C. Johnson & Sons
,
[86]
 this Court construed the phrase "paid under similar circumstances" under the most favored nation clause as referring to 
circumstances
 that are tax-related. In other words, the similarity in the 
circumstances of payment of taxes on the royalties derived from the 
Philippines is a condition/or the enjoyment of the most favored nation 
treatment.
 


 This Court explained in 
S.C. Johnson
 that bilateral tax 
treaties have been entered into by the Philippines with different 
countries to avoid double taxation. It held: 
  


 The purpose of these international agreements is to reconcile 
the national fiscal legislations of the contracting parties in order to 
help the taxpayer avoid simultaneous taxation in two different 
jurisdictions. More precisely, the tax conventions are drafted with a 
view towards the elimination of 
international juridical double taxation
,
 which is defined as the imposition of comparable taxes in two or more 
states on the same taxpayer in respect of the same subject matter and 
for identical periods. The apparent rationale for doing away with double
 taxation is to encourage the free flow of goods and services and the 
movement of capital, technology and persons between countries, 
conditions deemed vital in creating robust and dynamic economies. 
Foreign investments will only thrive in a fairly predictable and 
reasonable international investment climate and the protection against 
double taxation is crucial in creating such a climate.
[87]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) 




 This Court further explained that to eliminate double taxation, a tax treaty resorts to two methods: 
first
, by allocating the right to tax between the contracting states; and 
second
,
 where the state of source is assigned the right to tax, by requiring 
the state of residence to grant a tax relief either through exemption or
 tax credit. Thus: 
  


 Double taxation usually takes place when a person is resident of
 a contracting state and derives income from, or owns capital in, the 
other contracting state and both states impose tax on that income or 
capital. In order to eliminate double taxation, a tax treaty resorts to 
several methods. First, it sets out the respective rights to tax of the 
state of source or situs and of the state of residence with regard to 
certain classes of income or capital. In some cases, an exclusive right 
to tax is conferred on one of the contracting states; however, for other
 items of income or capital, both states are given the right to tax, 
although the amount of tax that may be imposed by the state of source is
 limited. 


 The second method for the elimination of double taxation applies
 whenever the state of source is given a full or limited right to tax 
together with the state of residence. In this case, the treaties make it
 incumbent upon the state of residence to allow relief in order to avoid
 double taxation. 
There are two methods of relief
 â 
the exemption method and the credit method. In the 
exemption
 method, the income or capital which is taxable in the state of source 
or situs is exempted in the state of residence, although in some 
instances it may be taken into account in determining the rate of tax 
applicable to the taxpayer's remaining income or capital. 
 On the other hand, in the 
credit
 method, although the income or capital which is taxed in the state of 
source is still taxable in the state of residence, the tax paid in the 
former is credited against the tax levied in the latter.
 The basic 
difference between the two methods is that in the exemption method, the 
focus is on the income or capital itself, whereas the credit method 
focuses upon the tax
. 
[88]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 The exemption and credit principles are the two leading principles
 in eliminating double taxation that are being followed in existing 
conventions between countries.
[89]
 

 Under the exemption principle, the income that may be taxed in the 
state of source is not taxed in the state of residence. This may be 
applied by two methods: 
full exemption
, where the state of residence does not account for the income from the state of source for tax purposes; or 
with progression
,
 where the income taxed in the state of source is not taxed by the state
 of residence, but the state of residence retains the right to consider 
that income when determining the tax to be imposed on the rest of the 
income.
[90]
 
 Under the 
credit principle, the state of residence retains the right to tax the 
taxpayer's total income, but allows a deduction for the tax paid in the 
state of source. It may be applied by two methods: a 
full credit
, where the total amount of tax paid in the state of source is allowed as deduction; or an 
ordinary credit
,
 where the deduction allowed by the state of residence is restricted to 
that part of its own tax appropriate to the income from the state of 
source.
[91]
 Some states have also adopted the so-called "
tax sparing
"
[92]
 provision, in relation to tax incentives granted under their respective domestic laws to attract foreign investments.
[93]
 With tax sparing, taxes exempted or reduced are considered fully paid.
[94]
 Consequently, a non-resident may obtain a tax credit for the taxes that have been "
spared
" under the incentive program of the state of source,
[95]
 preserving the economic benefits granted by the state of source. 
 Another form of tax sparing the so-called "matching credit,"
[96]

 where the state of residence agrees, as a counterpart to the reduced 
tax, to allow a deduction against its own tax of an amount fixed at a 
higher rate.
[97]
 In 
S.C. Johnson
,
 this Court stated that "[i]n negotiating tax treaties, the underlying 
rationale for reducing the tax rate is that the Philippines will give up
 a part of the tax in the expectation that the tax given up for this 
particular investment is not taxed by the other country." 
[98]
 It expounded:
  


 . . . the ultimate reason for avoiding double taxation is to 
encourage foreign investors to invest in the Philippines â a crucial 
economic goal for developing countries. The goal of double taxation 
conventions would be thwarted if such treaties did not provide for 
effective measures to minimize, if not completely eliminate, the tax 
burden laid upon the income or capital of the investor. Thus, if the 
rates of tax are lowered by the state of source, in this case, by the 
Philippines, there should be a concomitant commitment on the part of the
 state of residence to grant some form of tax relief, whether this be in
 the form of a tax credit or exemption. Otherwise, the tax which could 
have been collected by the Philippine government will simply be 
collected by another state, defeating the object of the tax treaty since
 the tax burden imposed upon the investor would remain unrelieved. If 
the state of residence does not grant some form of tax relief to the 
investor, no benefit would redound to the Philippines, i.e., increased 
investment resulting from a favorable tax regime, should it impose a 
lower tax rate on the royalty earnings of the investor, and it would be 
better to impose the regular rate rather than lose much-needed revenues 
to another country.

 In light of the purpose of tax treaties, the relevant treaty 
provisions on the tax treatment of particular items of income, combined 
with the provision on the elimination or avoidance of double taxation, 
govern the allocation of the right to tax between the contracting 
states. 
 In some tax treaties or international agreements, a most
 favored nation clause is added to ensure the contracting states of the 
benefit of concessions previously or subsequently to be made by either 
contracting state. This provision guards against oversight during treaty
 negotiation, and obviates the need for subsequent negotiations.
[100]
 The clause aims to prevent discriminations
[101]
 and to give assurance of the opportunity to enjoy equality of treatment.
[102]
 In 
S.C. Johnson
: 
  


 The purpose of a most favored nation clause is to grant to the 
contracting party treatment not less favorable than that which has been 
or may be granted to the "most favored" among other countries. The most 
favored nation clause is intended to establish the principle of equality
 of international treatment by providing that the citizens or subjects 
of the contracting nations may enjoy the privileges accorded by either 
party to those of the most favored nation. The essence of the principle 
is to allow the taxpayer in one state to avail of more liberal 
provisions granted in another tax treaty to which the country of 
residence of such taxpayer is also a party provided that the subject 
matter of taxation, in this case royalty income, is the same as that in 
the tax treaty under which the taxpayer is liable. Both Article 13 of 
the RP-US Tax Treaty and Article 12(2)(b) of the RP-West Germany Tax 
Treaty, above-quoted, speaks of tax on royalties for the use of 
trademark, patent, and technology. The entitlement of the 10% rate by 
U.S. firms despite the absence of a matching credit (20% for royalties) 
would derogate from the design behind the most favored nation clause to 
grant equality of international treatment since the tax burden laid upon
 the income of the investor is not the same in the two countries. The 
similarity in the circumstances of payment of taxes is a condition for 
the enjoyment of most favored nation treatment precisely to underscore 
the need for equality of treatment.
[103]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Per 
S.C. Johnson
, two conditions must be met for the most favored nation clause to apply. 
First
,
 royalties derived from the Philippines by a resident of the United 
States and of the third state must be of the same kind or class, in 
order to avail of the lower tax enjoyed by the third state. 
Second
,
 the tax consequences of royalty payments under the two treaties must be
 under similar circumstances. This requires a showing that the method 
employed for eliminating or mitigating the effects of double taxation 
under the treaty with the United States and the third state are the 
same. 
 In that case, this Court found that the United States 
resident was not entitled to the most favored nation tax rate of 10% on 
royalty income derived from the Philippines because the payment of such 
tax was not under similar circumstances. While Germany has a matching 
credit of 20% of the gross amount of royalties paid in the Philippines, 
there is no such similar credit granted by the United States.
[104]

 Here, there is no question as to compliance with the first condition. 
It is undisputed that payments to CAN Technologies for the use or 
entitlement to use its patent, technology, and copyrights on the 
manufacture and sale of animal feeds are within the definition of 
royalties under Article 13(3)
[105]
 of the RP-US Tax Treaty and Article 12(2)
[106]
 of the RP-Czech Tax Treaty. 

 On the second condition, this Court agrees with petitioner that 
differences pertaining to the taxpayers entitled to tax credit (
resident and citizen
 under RP-US Tax Treaty vs. 
resident 
under RP-Czech Tax Treaty) and to the timing of the recognition of the tax credit (taxes 
paid or accrued 
under
 RP-US Tax Treaty vs. taxes paid under RP-Czech Tax Treaty) do not 
amount to dissimilarities in the circumstances of the payment of the 
tax, which would have rendered the most favored nation clause 
inapplicable.
[107]
 As 
petitioner argued, the inclusion of "citizens" under the RP-US Tax 
Treaty is not a material distinguishing feature. What is important is 
that residents of both the United States and the Czech Republic are 
entitled to similar tax reliefs for taxes paid in the Philippines. 
Similarly, that taxes "paid or accrued" are allowed as tax credit under 
the RP-US Tax Treaty pertains merely to the timing of recognition of the
 credit, which depends on when the tax was levied at the state of 
source. Regardless, under the tax treaties, relief is required to be 
granted by the state of residence where an item of income is taxed by 
the state of source. 
 However, we find untenable petitioner's 
contention on the similarity of tax reliefs allowed by the United States
 and the Czech Republic. Both the RP-US Tax Treaty and the RP-Czech Tax 
Treaty were entered into "for the avoidance of double taxation and the 
prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income."

Article 22 

  ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION
        














1.


In the case of a resident of the Philippines, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: 






 


 






 


Subject to the laws of the 
Philippines and the limitations thereof regarding the allowance of a 
credit against the Philippine tax of tax paid in any country other than 
the Philippines, the Czech tax paid in respect of income derived from 
the Czech Republic shall be allowed as credit against the Philippine tax
 payable in respect of that income.






 


 






2.


In the case of a resident of the Czech Republic, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: 








 




a) The Czech Republic, when 
imposing taxes on its residents, may include in the tax base upon which 
such taxes are imposed the items of income which according to the 
provisions of this Convention may also be taxed in the Philippines, but 
shall allow as a deduction from the amount of tax computed on such a 
base 
an amount equal to the tax paid in the Philippines. Such 
deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Czech tax, as 
computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the 
income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may 
be taxed in the Philippines.
 


b) Where in accordance with any
 provision of the Convention income derived by a resident of the Czech 
Republic is exempt from tax in the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic 
may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of Czech tax on the 
remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted 
income. (Emphasis supplied)
















 








   	          	  	    	Indeed, both the United States and the Czech
 Republic adopt the credit principle, where the taxes paid in the 
Philippines on royalty income are allowed to be credited against the 
United States tax or Czech tax, as the case may be. However, a closer 
look at the treaty provisions would show that while the RP-Czech Tax 
Treaty specifies how the tax credit is to be implemented and its 
limitations, the RP-US Tax Treaty does not. 


 By looking at the RP-Czech Tax Treaty, we would already know how 
the credit is applied and what the maximum deduction allowed is: 
 
First
,
 the Czech tax is calculated based on the taxpayer's total income, 
including the income from the Philippines, but the tax paid in the 
Philippines is allowed as deduction from the Czech tax; and
 
Second
, the 
tax paid in the Philippines should not exceed the Czech tax appropriate to the Philippine-sourced income. 

 On the other hand, while the RP-US Tax Treaty does not provide details 
on how the credit is to be applied and its limitations, it expressly 
refers to the United States law in that the tax paid or accrued to the 
Philippines shall be allowed as a credit against United States tax 
in accordance with, and subject to the limitations of United States law
. Furthermore, the
 tax credit shall not exceed the limitations provided by the United States law for the taxable year.
 

 Moreover, under the RP-Czech Tax Treaty, the limitation on credit is 
already specifiedâthat the Philippine tax should not exceed the Czech 
tax payable for the same income. Under the RP-US Tax Treaty, the 
limitation on credit is not determinable unless we look into the 
internal tax law of the United States. 
 Therefore, the Court of 
Tax Appeals was correct in ruling that the relevant provisions of the 
United States law are necessary to determine for certain the similarity 
in circumstances in the payment of taxes on royalty in the United States
 and the Czech Republic. 
 In this regard, the Court of Tax Appeals First Division, as reiterated by the 
En Banc
, made the following findings: 
  


 Records show that petitioner failed to present evidence to prove
 or establish the provisions of the United States law which would 
determine the limitation being referred to in Article 23(1) of the RP-US
 Tax Treaty. Thus, We cannot say for certain that the RP-US Tax Treaty 
grants similar tax reliefs to residents of the United States with 
respect to taxes imposable upon royalties earned from sources within the
 Philippines as those allowed to Czech residents under the RP-Czech Tax 
Treaty. 


 The limitation of the amount that may be credited under the 
RP-US Tax Treaty must be clearly established. This must be so because 
the similarity in the circumstances of payment of taxes is a condition 
for the enjoyment of most favored nation treatment, precisely to 
underscore the need for equality of treatment.
[109]
 (Citation omitted) 




 Petitioner, however, invokes the doctrine of 
processual presumption
,
 which provides that "in the absence of pleading and proof, the laws of 
the foreign country or state will be presumed to be the same as our 
local or domestic law."
[110]
 
It argues that the limitation on credit may then be clearly established 
by referring to our domestic law, which is presumed to be the same as 
the United States law on the matter. It adds that Section 904(a) of the 
United States Internal Revenue Code is similar to Section 34(c)(4) of 
the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.
[111]
 This Court is not convinced. 
  
The International law doctrine of 
processual presumption
 or 
presumed-identity approach
 comes into play when a party invoking the application of a foreign law to a dispute fails to prove the foreign law.
[112]
 While the doctrine has been applied in cases involving common carriers, 
[113]
 property relations of spouses,
[114]
 maritime 
[115]
 and labor,
[116]
 it is not applicable in this case. 
  
 It is a fundamental taxation principle that a state may tax persons, property, 
income
, or business within its territorial limits.
[117]

 Royalty income derived by a non-resident foreign corporation in the 
Philippines are generally taxed at 35% (for payments before January 1, 
2009) pursuant to Section 28(B)(1)
[118]

 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997. However, such royalties 
may be exempt or partially exempt (if subject to a reduced rate only) to
 the extent required by any treaty obligation binding on the 
Philippines. Section 32(B)(5) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 
1997, as amended, provides: 
  


 SECTION 32. 
Gross Income
. â


 . . . .


 (B) Exclusions from Gross Income. â The following items shall 
not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation under 
this Title: 


  . . . .


 (5) 
Income Exempt under Treaty
. â Income of any kind, to the extent required by any treaty obligation binding upon the Government of the Philippines. 




 Thus, a foreign corporation may avail of the benefits of a tax 
treaty concluded by the Philippines with its country of residence by 
invoking the treaty provisions and proving that they apply to it. In 
other words, unless clearly proven that the treaty provisions apply to 
it, a non-resident foreign corporation, like CAN Technologies, shall be 
taxed according to the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as 
amended. 
 Petitioner's claim on behalf of CAN Technologies for 
refund of "erroneously paid withholding tax on royalty income" is 
anchored on the 10% preferential tax rate under the RP-Czech Tax Treaty,
 in relation to the most favored nation clause of the RP-US Tax Treaty. 
Consequently, compliance with the conditions for the applicability of 
the most favored nation clause must be proven as a fact. It is necessary
 to show the similarity in tax reliefs accorded by the United States and
 the Czech Republic under their respective treaties with the 
Philippines. 
 With regard to the RP-US Tax Treaty, a specific 
reference was made to the United States law for the limitation on 
allowable tax credit. This requires that the pertinent provisions of the
 United States law be presented in evidence. Whether the United States 
law imposes the same restrictions on tax credit as those imposed in the 
RP-Czech Tax Treaty is a question of fact that petitioner must prove. 
 Petitioner misapplies the doctrine of 
processual presumption
 in a bid to escape the consequences of its failure to present the pertinent provisions of the United States law. 
  
 A tax refund hinged on a lower tax rate under the RP-Czech Tax
 Treaty, in relation to the RP-US Tax Treaty, is akin to a tax 
exemption, and is strictly construed against the taxpayer.
[119]
 Petitioner bears the burden of proving its claim indubitably. It cannot be permitted to rest on vague implications.
[120]
 As this Court held: 
  


 This Court has laid down the rule that "as the power of taxation
 is a high prerogative of sovereignty, the relinquishment is never 
presumed and any reduction or diminution thereof with respect to its 
mode or its rate, must be strictly construed, and the same must be 
coached in clear and unmistakable terms in order that it may be 
applied." More specifically stated, the general rule is that any claim 
for exemption from the tax statute should be strictly construed against 
the taxpayer.
[121]




 All told, the most favored nation clause cannot apply. Petitioner 
cannot avail of the lower 10% tax rate under the RP-Czech Tax Treaty for
 its failure to prove that the tax on royalties under the RP-US Tax 
Treaty was paid under circumstances similar to the tax on royalties 
under the RP-Czech Tax Treaty. Accordingly, there is no overpayment of 
tax on royalties from June 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007. The Court of Tax 
Appeals correctly denied petitioner's claim for refund of P8,771,270.71.

may be taxed in that other State. 






2.


However, such royalties may

    Subject to any provisions of the law of New Zealand which may from 
time to time be in force and which relate to the allowance of a credit 
against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand 
(which shall not affect the general principle hereof), Philippine tax 
paid under the law of the Philippines and consistently with this 
Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income 
derived by a New Zealand resident from sources in the Philippines 
(excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the 
profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit 
against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. . . 
Where,
 in terms of paragraph 2(b)(i) of Article 12, a resident of New Zealand 
derives income from royalties which are paid by an enterprise registered
 with the Philippine Board of Investments and engaged in preferred areas
 of activity he shall be deemed to have paid in addition to the 
Philippine tax actually paid, Philippine tax in an amount equal to 10 
percent of the gross amount of the royalties
. (Emphasis supplied)

 METHODS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION
  


  






1.


Where a resident of a 
Contracting State derives income which, in accordance with the 
provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting 
State, the first Contracting State shall allow as a deduction from the 
tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the income tax 
paid in the other Contracting State. The deduction shall not, however, 
exceed that part of the income tax as computed before the deduction is 
given, which is appropriate to the income which may be taxed in the 
other Contracting State.






2.


For the deduction indicated in 
paragraph I, the Brazilian tax and the Philippine tax shall always be 
deemed to have been paid at the rate of 25 per cent in the following 
cases
:








a) dividends referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10;
