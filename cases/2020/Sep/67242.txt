LEONEN, J.:


The copyright of a derivative work solely 
belongs to the person who fixes an idea into a tangible medium of 
expression. The law on copyright only protects the expression of an 
idea, not the idea itself. Thus, one who merely contributes concepts or 
ideas is not deemed an author. 
 For this Court's resolution is a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Court of Appeals' Decision
[2]
 and Resolution.
[3]
 The challenged judgments reversed the Regional Trial Court's Decision,
[4]

 which ordered the cancellation of respondents' certificates of 
copyright registration over the designs of the Philippine National 
Police (PNP) cap device and badge.
[5]

 In 1996, the PNP Directorate for Logistics Support Service authorized 
the procurement of new uniforms and equipment for the PNP, including 
brand new cap devices and badges. The PNP Directorate on Research and 
Development, Clothing, and Criminalistics Equipment Division assumed the
 responsibility of updating the designs of the PNP cap device and badge.
[6]

 The present PNP cap device and badge have the following distinctive 
features: (1) a native shield, depicted as a vertically elongated 
hexagon; (2) a sword-and-shield wielding warrior purporting to be 
Lapu-Lapu; (3) eight (8) rays of the sun representing the first eight 
(8) provinces to revolt against Spain; (4) three (3) pentagram stars 
representing Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao; (5) laurel leaves; and (6) 
the words "service, honor, and justice."
[7]
 
 The designs of the present PNP cap device and badge were previously used by the Philippine Constabulary in its coat of arms.
[8]

 The PNP Directorate on Research and Development, Clothing, and 
Criminalistics Equipment Division collaborated with Jose C. Tupaz, IV 
(Tupaz) to create the new designs of the PNP cap device and badge. Tupaz
 volunteered and rendered his services for free.
[9]

 Under their agreement, Tupaz will sketch the new designs and produce 
samples or prototypes. The samples will then be presented before the 
PNP's Uniform and Equipment Standardization Board for approval.
[10]

 Tupaz drew the new designs based on the PNP's specifications and 
instructions. He then submitted the finished sketches to the PNP for 
evaluation. Thereafter, the designs were transmitted to and approved by 
the National Police Commission.
[11]

 Upon approval of the new designs, the PNP conducted a public bidding 
for the procurement of the new PNP cap devices and badges. Among those 
who participated was El Oro Industries, Inc. (El Oro).
[12]
 Tupaz was El Oro's then-president and chair of the board of directors.
[13]

 El Oro submitted the second highest bid price. After the tabulation of 
the bids, El Oro presented before the PNP's Bids and Awards Committee 
certificates of copyright registration over the PNP cap device and badge
 issued in favor of Tupaz. Hence, the contract was not awarded to the 
winning bidder, but to El Oro.
[14]

 No other manufacturer attempted to produce the PNP cap device and badge
 bearing the new designs for fear of copyright infringement.
[15]

 Police Director Jose S. Andaya, head of the PNP Directorate on Research
 and Development, Clothing, and Criminalistics Equipment Division, wrote
 the National Library requesting the cancellation of the certificates of
 copyright registration of the PNP cap device and badge. However, the 
National Library did not act on the request.
[16]

 Subsequently, the Republic of the Philippines, through the PNP, filed a
 Complaint before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court for the 
cancellation of Tupaz's certificates of copyright registration, with a 
prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.
[17]


 In their Answer, El Oro and Tupaz alleged that El Oro is the 
exclusive and official engraver of Philippine heraldry items since 1953.
 They claimed that Tupaz's ancestor, Jose T. Tupaz, Jr., developed the 
original designs on which the present designs of the PNP cap device and 
badge were based. Hence, El Oro owned the copyright over the new designs
 and was allegedly the only qualified bidder.
[18]


 In its Decision,
[19]
 the Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of the Republic of the Philippines. The dispositive portion states: 
  


 WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants as follows: 








(a)


[O]rdering the defendant 
National Library to cancel Certificate of Copyright Registration No. 
96-589 over the PNP Cap Device and Certificate of Copyright Registration
 No. 96-721 over the PNP badge issued in favor of defendant/s Jose C. 
Tupaz IV and/or El Oro Industries Inc., and to issue two new 
certificates of copyright registration in the name of the Philippine 
National Police in lieu of these two aforecited certificates of 
copyright registration; and














(b)


[O]rdering the issuance of a writ of 
prohibitory injunction, permanently prohibiting defendant/s Jose C. 
Tupaz IV and/or El Oro Industries Inc., and other persons/parties 
deriving interest from said defendant/s from manufacturing, using[,] and
 selling the PNP cap devices and badges bearing the designs created and 
developed by the Philippine National Police which are the subject 
matters of Certificates of Copyright Registration Nos. 96-589 and 
96-721, which had now been ordered cancelled as provided herein.








All other claim/s including the counterclaim are dismissed for lack of legal and/or factual basis. 


 SO ORDERED.
[20]
 




 The Regional Trial Court declared that the new designs of the PNP 
cap device and badge were created by the PNP Directorate for Research 
and Development, Clothing, and Criminalistics Equipment Division. Under 
Section 176.1 of Republic Act No. 8293,
[21]

 the new designs are works of the Philippine government, the copyright 
of which may not be registered in favor of private entities.
[22]
 El Oro and Tupaz moved for reconsideration, but their motion was denied.
[23]
 
 Pending appeal before the Court of Appeals, Tupaz passed away.
[24]
 He was substituted in the case by his heirs.
[25]
 
 In its Decision,
[26]

 the Court of Appeals reversed the Regional Trial Court's ruling and 
lifted the writ of prohibitory injunction issued against El Oro, Tupaz, 
and their successors-in-interest. 
 The Court of Appeals 
classified the new designs of the PNP cap device and badge as derivative
 works under Section 2(P) of Presidential Decree No. 49.
[27]

 	According to the Court of Appeals, a derivative work is entitled to 
copyright protection, if produced with the consent of the original 
work's author, and if it has a "distinguishable non-trivial variation" 
from the original.
[28]
 The Court of Appeals ruled that both requirements were present.
[29]

 Although both parties claim authorship over the pre-existing designs, 
the Court of Appeals nevertheless held that the consent requirement was 
met because both parties agreed to use the pre-existing designs as basis
 for the new designs. Moreover, the new designs are substantially 
distinct from the preÂ­ existing designs.
[30]
 In its Decision, the Court of Appeals stated: 
  


 Comparing Exhibits A-1 (the cap device designed earlier used by 
the PNP) and A-2 (the design for which Tupaz obtained a copyright 
registration certificate), substantial changes in the appearance are 
present. Some of these distinctions are: the native shield in Exhibit 
A-1 is checkered cream and red in color while the one in Exhibit A-2 is 
silver; eight short sun rays appear on top of Exhibit A-2 while there is
 none in the other earlier design; and the flowers in Exhibit A-2 are 
mere buds while the ones in Exhibit A-1 have open petals. Notable 
changes are also present if Exhibits B-1 (the badge design earlier used 
by the PNP) and B-2 (another design for which Tupaz obtained a 
certificate [of copyright registration]) are compared. For instance, 
among other differences, colors (black, red, white and blue) and eight 
short sun rays on top of the design are incorporated in Exhibit B-2 
while Exhibit B-1 does not contain these details.
[31]
 




 The Court of Appeals declared Tupaz as the author of the new 
designs. The PNP only contributed ideas, but it was Tupaz who actually 
made the new designs. The Court of Appeals emphasized that the law on 
copyright protects the expression of an idea, but not the idea itself.
[32]
 
 The Republic of the Philippines then filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[33]
 before this Court. In a September 14, 2011 Resolution,
[34]

 this Court required respondents to comment on the petition. However, 
they failed to file their comment on the petition. Subsequently, this 
Court issued a show cause order requiring respondent Tupaz to explain 
why he should not be held in contempt, and to submit the required 
comment on the petition.
[35]


The Resolution, and other subsequent Resolutions of this Court, were returned unserved to respondents.
[36]
 In another Resolution,
[37]

 this Court required the Office of the Solicitor General to submit the 
current addresses of respondents so that they may be served with court 
processes.  
  
 The Office of the Solicitor General manifested that respondent
 Tupaz received a copy of the petition based on the postmaster's 
certification. Meanwhile, respondent Ma. Corazon Tupaz passed away on 
August 30, 2010. On the other hand, the whereabouts of respondents Ma. 
Jeanette T. Caling, Ma. Junella T. Avjean, Marie Jocelyn T. Dexheimer, 
and Jon Ferdinand T. Tupaz could not be ascertained.
[38]
 

 Extraordinary efforts to serve copies of the resolutions ordering 
respondents to file their comment failed. This Court later resolved to 
dispense with the filing of respondents' comment on the petition.
[39]
 

 Petitioner concedes that only questions of law may be raised in a 
Petition for Review on Certiorari brought under Rule 45 of the Rules of 
Court. However, it claims that the present case is exempted from the 
application of the general rule for two (2) reasons. First, the factual 
findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to the findings of the 
trial court. Second, the conclusion of the Court of Appeals
[40]
 is "grounded entirely on speculation, surmise[s,] and conjectures[.]"
[41]

 Petitioner argues that derivative works are entitled to protection 
under Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 49 only if they were 
"produced with the consent of the creator or proprietor of the original 
works[.]"
[42]
 However, the 
Court of Appeals failed to establish the true author of the pre-existing
 designs. This is relevant to determine who can give consent.
[43]

 Moreover, petitioner maintains that there is no substantial distinction
 between the new designs and the pre-existing designs. The distinctive 
features of the pre-existing designs were exactly adopted in the new 
designs. The differences pointed out by the Court of Appeals are only 
trivial distinctions. Due to the absence of distinguishable non-trivial 
variations, the new designs cannot be copyrighted as derivative or new 
works under Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 49.
[44]
 
 This case presents the following issues for this Court's resolution: 
  
First, whether or not this Court may undertake a factual review. 


 Second, whether or not the new designs of the PNP cap device and 
badge are entitled to protection as derivative works under Section 8 of 
Presidential Decree No. 49. 


 Lastly, whether or not the PNP, as contributor of ideas, should be deemed as the author of the new designs.


 The petition is unmeritorious. 


 I


 The scope of this Court's jurisdiction over petitions brought 
under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing 
questions of law.
[45]
 This Court will not entertain questions of fact because it is not duty-bound to weigh and analyze evidence anew.
[46]

 The factual findings of the appellate courts are generally final and 
conclusive on this Court when supported by substantial evidence.
[47]
 

 The question pertaining to the authorship of a copyrightable work is a 
factual matter that generally goes beyond the scope of review in a Rule 
45 Petition. 	However, this Court may undertake a factual review when 
the findings of the Court of Appeals are "contrary to those of the trial
 court[.]"
[48]
 
 In this
 case, the Regional Trial Court and Court of Appeals differed as to who 
created the new designs of the PNP cap device and badge. Also, both 
tribunals applied different laws. The Regional Trial Court rendered its 
Decision based on the present intellectual property code or Republic Act
 No. 8293.
[49]
 The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, relied on the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 49.
[50]

 This case shall be resolved using the provisions of Presidential Decree
 No. 49, not Republic Act No. 8293. Presidential Decree No. 49 was the 
law in force at the time the new designs of the PNP cap device and badge
 were made. It was also the law in force when the certificates of 
copyright registration were issued to respondents in 1996.
[51]
 Republic Act No. 8293, which amended Presidential Decree No. 49, only took effect on January 1, 1998.
[52]
 
 
II(A)


 Copyright is "the right granted by statute to the proprietor 
of an intellectual production to its exclusive use and enjoyment[.]"
[53]

 It "may be obtained and enjoyed only with respect to the subjects and 
by the persons, and on terms and conditions specified in the statute."
[54]

 Copyright is a purely statutory right. Only classes of works falling 
under the statutory enumeration are entitled to protection.
[55]

 Copyright has two rationales: the economic benefit and social benefit. 
The economic benefit is reaped by the author from his work while the 
social benefit manifests when it creates impetus for individuals to be 
creative.
[56]
 Copyright, like 
other intellectual property rights, grants legal protection by 
prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction of the author's work.
[57]

  It "create[s] a temporary monopoly on varying types of knowledge, 
allowing their owners to restrict and even prevent, other from using 
that knowledge."
[58]
 By eliminating fear of other's appropriation and exploitation of an author's work, intellectual creation is incentivized.
[59]

 When the concept of copyright emerged, it was primarily concerned with 
the advancement of a common social good and not so much about the 
author's rights. Copyright statutes were initially crafted for the 
reading public and to encourage education through the production of 
books.
[60]
 Copyright 
traces its beginnings in 1476 when printing was first introduced in 
England. The English Crown then had two (2) main reasons in regulating 
printing through licensing: (1) to suppress dissent, which was rapidly 
growing due to easier reproduction of materials; and (2) to profit from 
those who are willing to pay for the exclusive right to print particular
 books. Subsequently, the control of publishing was ceded to a group of 
printers, bookbinders, and booksellers called Stationer's Company 
through a printing patent which grants monopoly over the English 
publishing trade. Through the Stationer's Company, the English Crown 
maintained its political and economic interest in the publishing trade.
[61]
 

 The Stationer's Company eventually lost its power when the Licensing 
Act expired in 1694. Failing to convince the Parliament to extend its 
powers, the Stationer's Company lobbied for the interests of authors 
over publishers. In 1710, the Statute of Anne, the first copyright act, 
was enacted. The Statute of Anne granted the Stationer's Company the 
remedies they needed to maintain their existing publication rights. 
However, it removed the Stationer's Company's monopoly by allowing 
anyone, whether an author or a publisher, to obtain copyright by mere 
registration. The law further provided a limited term of copyright 
instead of the former perpetual monopoly. It granted 14 years for the 
work's publication which is renewable for another 14 years, if the 
author was still alive.
[62]
 

 While the Statute of Anne was seen as an anti-monopoly trade 
regulation, it mainly focused on the author's social contribution and 
the advancement of education through the production of books.
[63]

 It is not mainly after the "recognition of any pre-existing authorial 
right, nor...the regulation of the booksellers' market[,]" but the 
promotion of "the free market of ideas[.]"
[64]
 

 The Statute of Anne only covered books, but succeeding laws added other
 subjects as new technology emerged, such as engravings, sculptures, 
paintings, drawings, photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures.
[65]

 The first copyright law of the United States, the Act of 1790, was 
modeled after the Statute of Anne. It initially covered books, maps, and
 charts and similarly required a formal registration and granted a 
14-year copyright renewable for another 14-year term.
[66]
 In its subsequent amendments, the period was extended to 28 years
[67]

 and it expanded copyright to other works such as historical and other 
prints, dramatic works and its public performance, photographs, visual 
art, and musical compositions.
[68]

 It later included the right  to create derivative works and the 
prohibition on copyright protection in  government publications.
[69]
 Intellectual property law in our jurisdiction dates back during the Spanish occupation.
[70]

 When the United States took over the Philippines through the Treaty of 
Paris in 1898, "patents, trademarks, and copyrights that were granted by
 the Spanish government continued to have legal effect in the 
[Philippines.]"
[71]
 
While under the United States occupation, Act No. 3134, otherwise known 
as the Copyright Law of the Philippine Island, was passed.
[72]
 Act No. 3134 was based on the United States Copyright Law of 1909.
[73]

 After the Philippines gained its independence in 1946, Act No. 3134 
provided the legal framework for intellectual property law in our 
jurisdiction.
[74]
 Years later, laws on patent
[75]
 and trademark
[76]
 were enacted, creating a patent office for the registration of trademarks, trade names, and service marks.
[77]
 

 In 1972, Presidential Decree No. 49, otherwise known as the Decree on 
the Protection of Intellectual Property, was passed, superseding Act No.
 3134. Nevertheless, Presidential Decree No. 49 was heavily modeled 
after Act No. 3134.
[78]
 

 Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 49 enumerates different classes of
 copyrightable works, which are protected from the moment of creation: 
  


 SECTION 2. The rights granted by this Decree shall, from the 
moment of creation, subsist with respect to any of the following classes
 of works: 








(A)


 
Books, including composite and cyclopedic works, manuscripts, directories, and gazetteers;






(B)


 
Periodicals, including pamphlets and newspapers; 






(C)


 
Lectures, sermons, addresses, dissertations prepared for oral delivery; 






(D)


 
Letters;






(E)


 
Dramatic or dramatico-musical 
compositions; choreographic works and entertainments in dumb shows, the 
acting form of which is fixed in writing or otherwise; 






(F)


 
Musical compositions, with or without words;






(G)


Works of drawing, painting, 
architecture, sculpture, engraving, lithography, and other works of art;
 models or designs for works of art; 






(H)


 
Reproductions of a work of art; 






(I)


 
Original ornamental designs or models for articles of manufacture, whether or not patentable, and other works of applied art;






(J)


 
Maps, plans, sketches, and charts; 






(K)


 
Drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character;






(L)


 
Photographic works and works produced by a process analogous to photography; lantern slides; 






(M)


 
Cinematographic works and works 
produced by a process analogous to cinematography or any process for 
making audio-visual recordings;






(N)


 
Computer programs;






(O)


 
Prints, pictorial illustrations, advertising copies, labels, tags, and box wraps;






(P)


 
Dramatizations, translations, 
adaptations, abridgements, arrangements and other alterations of 
literary, musical or artistic works or of works of the Philippine 
Government as herein defined, which shall be protected as provided in 
Section 8 of this Decree;






(Q)


Collections of literary, scholarly, 
or artistic works or of works referred to in Section 9 of this Decree 
which by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents 
constitute intellectual creations, the same to be protected as such in 
accordance with Section 8 of this Decree; 






(R)


 
Other literary, scholarly, scientific[,] and artistic works. 










The enumeration under Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 49 is 
substantially similar to that which can be found in Section 172.1 of the
 subsequent law, Republic Act No. 8293.
[79]


 Under both laws, the copyright vests upon the sole fact of creation.
[80]
 Presidential Decree No. 49 requires the registration and deposit of some works with the National Library.
[81]
 Noncompliance with this rule "does not deprive the copyright owner of the right to sue for infringement."
[82]

 However, it limits the remedies of copyright owners, denies them of the
 right to recover damages, and subjects them to certain sanctions. 
[83]

 Republic Act No. 8293 retains the registration and deposit requirement 
but only for the purpose of "completing the records of the National 
Library and the Supreme Court Library[.]"
[84]
 The present law "does not require registration of the work to fully recover in an infringement suit."
[85]
 
II(B)


 Broadly defined, a derivative work refers to a work that is "based on...one or more already existing works."
[86]
 The author of a derivative work borrows expressive content from an existing work and transforms it into another work.
[87]

 Through this process, the author of a derivative work does not simply 
copy the existing work but creates an original work entitled to a 
separate copyright.
[88]
 
Although the expression in the derivative work is "intermingled with the
 expression from the underlying work," the derivative author contributes
 original expression to the new work making it distinct from the 
underlying work.
[89]
 Derivative works right is inseparable from the adaptation right of the original work's author.
[90]

 Adaptation right is included in the bundle of rights granted to a 
recognized author or owner of an intellectual property. Under Section 
5(B) of Presidential Decree No. 49:
  


 SECTION 5. Copyright shall consist in the exclusive right;


 â¦.


 (B) To make any translation or other version or extracts or 
arrangements or adaptations thereof; to dramatize it if it be a 
non-dramatic work; to convert it into a non-dramatic work if it be a 
drama; to complete or execute it if it be a model or design[.]




 Under earlier laws, authors are not granted adaptation rights. The
 original author's right was narrow as it only covered the literal 
copying of the material. For instance, an author cannot claim an 
injunction against the unauthorized translation of his or her work to 
another language, because the rights granted under the copyright only 
extends to "printing, reprinting, publishing or vending."
[91]
 Adaptation right was later introduced as copyright expanded beyond literal copying. Similar to existing laws in United Kingdom,
[92]
 Canada,
[93]
 and Australia,
[94]

 the United States' 1909 Copyright Act then allowed "abridgements, 
adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other 
version of works...of copyrighted works" only when produced with the 
author's consent.
[95]
 This statutory text was adopted in Act No. 3134, and later in Presidential Decree No. 49.
[96]


 Borne out of copyright's expansion, the notion of derivative 
works was introduced in the legal scheme. When the adaptation of an 
original work was authorized by the owner, and when distinct from the 
underlying work, the resulting derivative work is copyrightable.   
  
 No exact definition of derivative works is found in 
Presidential Decree No. 49 and Republic Act No. 8293. However, both laws
 provide examples consistent with the Berne Convention. 
 Under 
Article 2(3) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and 
Artistic Works (Berne Convention) to which the Philippines is a 
contracting party,
[97]
 
derivative works pertain to "[t]ranslations, adaptations, arrangements 
of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work[.]"

 Section 2(P) of Presidential Decree No. 49 grants copyright protection 
to "[d]ramatizations, translations, adaptations, abridgements, 
arrangements and other alterations of literary, musical or artistic 
works or of works of the Philippine Government[.]" Republic Act No. 8293
 devotes a separate chapter to derivative works. The enumeration is 
substantially similar to that found in Presidential Decree No. 49. 
However, it excludes from copyright protection derivative works based on
 existing works of the government.
[98]
 

 Presidential Decree No. 49 gives special attention to derivative works 
and how it may be granted copyright as a new work. Under Section 8 of 
the law: 
  


 SECTION 8. The works referred to in subsections (P) and (O) of Section 2 of this Decree shall, 
when produced with the consent of the creator or proprietor of the original works on which they are based
,
 be protected as new works; however, such new works shall not affect the
 force of any subsisting copyright upon the original works employed or 
any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such 
use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such 
original works. (Emphasis supplied)
[99]
 




 Presidential Decree No. 49 is consistent with prevailing 
conventions when it was enacted. Under the Berne Convention and the 
Universal Copyright Convention, authors of original works retain the 
exclusive right of control over their works. Pertinent articles of the 
conventions provide: 
 Berne Convention
 Article 8. 

    Right of Translation
. 
  


 Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this 
Convention shall enjoy the exclusive right of making and of authorizing 
the translation of their works throughout the term of protection of 
their rights in the original works. 

    . . . .




 Article 12. 

  Right of Adaptation, Arrangement and Other Alteration
. 
  


 Authors of literary or artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive 
right of authorizing adaptations, arrangements and other alterations of 
their works.
[100]
 




 Universal Copyright Convention
  


 Article V


 1. Copyright shall include the exclusive right of the author to 
make, publish, and authorize the making and publication of translations 
of works protected under this Convention. 




The Court of Appeals correctly classified the new designs of the 
PNP cap device and badge as derivative works. Respondents, in 
collaboration with the PNP and upon its instruction, borrowed expressive
 content from the preÂ­ existing designs of the PNP cap device and badge 
to create the new. The new designs are considered alterations of 
artistic works under Section 2(P) of Presidential Decree No. 49. 
However, they can only be copyrighted if they were produced with the 
consent of the creator of the pre-existing designs and if there is 
distinction between the new designs and the pre-existing designs. 


 Both requisites are present in this case. 
 The Regional 
Trial Court and the Court of Appeals failed to determine who authored 
the pre-existing designs. Respondents assert that they owned both 
designs because their ancestor, Jose T. Tupaz, Jr., is the author of the
 original designs of the PNP cap device and badge. On the other hand, 
petitioner claims that it owned the designs. However, this would be of 
little or of no consequence considering that the parties asserting 
ownership over the pre-existing designs are the very same ones who 
collaborated to create the new designs. It would have been a different 
matter if a third party also claimed ownership over the pre-existing 
designs. What is clear is that both parties agreed to create the new 
designs from the pre-existing designs. 
 Since the creator of the 
new designs must borrow expressive content from the pre-existing 
designs, the new designs would obviously incorporate elements of the 
original material. In this case, the borrowed elements of the original 
material are the native shield, the eight (8) rays of the sun, three (3)
 stars' laurel leaves' and the words "service," "honor," and "Justice."
[101]

 The test of whether the new designs are copyrightable independently 
from the pre-existing works is the presence of originality in the 
derivative work. The new work, although similar to the pre-existing work
 in some of its expressive elements, must be substantially distinct from
 the pre-existing work.
[102]

 A careful comparison of the pre-existing designs and the new designs 
shows that there are substantial distinctions between the two:

 Pre-existing PNP Cap Device & 
Figure 1.2
 Redesigned PNP Cap Device 




The most prominent feature of the pre-existing PNP cap device is 
the native shield. In the new design of the PNP cap device, the native 
shield has been reduced in size and the laurel leaves are made more 
noticeable. The Court of Appeals observed that the native shield in the 
pre-existing design is "checkered cream and red in color." On the other 
hand, the native shield in the new design is silver.
[104]


 The pre-existing PNP cap device contains the words "PHILIPPINE 
NATIONAL POLICE" located inside the native shield, which was eliminated 
in the new design. Instead, the words "PHILIPPINES" and "POLICE" were 
placed at the top and bottom of the cap device, respectively. 
Furthermore, the word "POLICE" is more prominent in the new design. 
There are also 8 short sun rays on top of the cap device:

Pre-existing: PNP Badge & 
Figure 2.2
 Redesigned PNP Badge 
    




With regard to the PNP badge, the most prominent feature of the 
preÂ­ existing design is the native shield, which has been reduced in 
size in the new design. Another prominent feature of the pre-existing 
design is the badge number. The badge number in the new design was 
reduced and placed at the bottom portion. 
  
  
 The words "PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE" were transposed from 
the native shield in the pre-existing design and were placed on top in 
the new design. The shapes of the two designs are also different. The 
new design takes the general shape of an oval compared to the 
pre-existing design. Aside from these, the Court of Appeals observed 
that the new design contains the colors black, red, white, and blue.
[105]
 
 
III


 Under Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 49, the copyright 
belongs to the creator of the work or the creator's heirs or assigns. If
 the work is created by two (2) or more persons, they shall own the 
copyright jointly.
[106]
 The same principles are embodied in Sections 178.1 and 178.2 of Republic Act No. 8293.
[107]
 
 Unlike Republic Act No. 8293, which defines an author as the "natural person who has created the work[,]"
[108]

 Presidential Decree No. 49 does not provide a definition of an author 
or a creator. Despite the law's silence, an author, for purposes of 
copyright ownership, should be deemed as one who fixes an abstract idea 
into something tangible. 
 The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects 
of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which took effect in 
the Philippines on January 1, 1995,
[109]

 states that "copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not 
to ideas, procedures, methods of operation[,] or mathematical concepts 
as such."
[110]
 More 
commonly referred to as the "idea/expression dichotomy," the principle 
in copyright protection is that "ideas are not protectable" and only 
expressions of those ideas may be subject to copyright protection.
[111]
 In
 ABS-CBN Corp. v. Gozon
,
[112]
 this Court distinguished ideas and expression of ideas in relation to what may be the subject of copyright: 
  


 An idea or event must be distinguished from the expression of 
that idea or event. An idea has been likened to a ghost in that it "must
 be spoken to a little before it will explain itself."
 
    ... 


 Ideas can be either abstract or concrete. It is the concrete ideas that are generally referred to as expression: 




 The words "abstract" and "concrete" arise in many cases dealing with the idea/expression distinction. The 
Nichols

 court, for example, found that the defendant's film did not infringe 
the plaintiffs play because it was "too generalized an abstraction from 
what plaintiff wrote ... only a part of her ideas." In 
Eichel v. Marcin,

 the court said that authors may exploit facts, experiences, field of 
thought, and general ideas found in another's work, "provided they do 
not substantially copy a concrete form, in which the circumstances and 
ideas have been developed, arranged, and put into shape." Judge Hand, in
 National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc. said that "no one infringes, unless he descends so far into what is concrete as to invade... 'expression."'


 These cases seem to be distinguishing "abstract" ideas from 
"concrete" tangible embodiments of these abstractions that may be termed
 expression. However, if the concrete form of a work means more than the
 literal expression contained within it, it is difficult to determine 
what is meant by "concrete." 
Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language

 provides several meanings for the word concrete. These include: "having
 a material, perceptible existence; of, belonging to, or characterized 
by things or events that can be perceived by the senses; real; actual;" 
and "referring to a particular; specific, not general or abstract."
[113]
 (Citations omitted) 






 
Joaquin v. Drilon
 
[114]

 also illustrates the distinction between ideas and expression of ideas 
regarding copyrightable subject matter. The petitioner in Joaquin 
claimed that the format of its dating game show called 'Rhoda and Me' is
 entitled to copyright protection.
[115]
 In ruling against the petitioner, this Court underscored the principle that the law on copyright is purely statutory.
[116]
 Only classes of work enumerated in Pres. Decree No. 49 are subject to copyright.
[117]
 Thus, the format of a television show, not falling within the enumeration, is not copyrightable.
[118]
 Furthermore, this Court stated:
  


 
P.D. No. 49, Â§2, in enumerating what are subject to copyright, refers to finished works and not to concepts. 
The
 copyright does not extend to an idea, procedure, process, system, 
method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the
 form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in 
such work.
[119]
 (Citation omitted, emphasis supplied)




 Although a creator or author is not expressly defined under Pres. 
Decree No. 49, it may be logically inferredâbased on the scope of 
copyrightable worksâthat a creator or an author pertains to someone who 
transforms an abstract idea into a tangible form of expression through 
the application of skill or labor. 
 To create a thing that may be
 entitled to a copyright requires something more than the giving of 
ideas and concepts. Ideas should translate to or transition into 
something that is tangible or physical. In other words, something 
capable of being perceived must be produced. To illustrate, an image 
that remains in a person's mind would not be entitled to copyright 
protection unless he or she draws it on a piece of paper or paints the 
image on canvass. 
 In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner
 and respondent Tupaz collaborated to develop the new designs of the PNP
 cap device and badge. However, the extent of petitioner's participation
 in developing the new designs of the PNP cap device and badge was 
limited to instructing respondent Tupaz on how the designs should appear
 in general and what specific elements should be incorporated.
[120]
 Petitioner merely supplied ideas and concepts.
[121]

 It was respondent Tupaz who used his skill and labor to concretize what
 petitioner had envisioned. Therefore, petitioner cannot be considered 
as an author of the new designs either in whole or in part. 
 Petitioner is also not entitled to own the copyright under any of the exceptions in Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 49.
[122]

 The first exception refers to works created in the course of the 
employment of the creator. Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 49 
states:	
  


 If the work in which copyright subsists was made during and in 
the course of the employment of the creator, the copyright shall belong 
to: 








(a)


The employee, if the 
creation of the object of copyright is not a part of his regular duties 
even if the employee uses the time, facilities and materials of the 
employer. 














(b)


 
The employer, if the work is the 
result of the performance of his regularly assigned duties, unless there
 is an agreement, express or implied to the contrary. 
[123]










Section 178.3 of Republic Act No. 8293, retains the rule regarding works created in the course of the employment.
[124]
 


 The second exception refers to commissioned works. The creator of 
the work should be paid valuable consideration for the work made. 
Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 49 states that the copyright of a 
commissioned work belongs in joint ownership to the creator and the 
person who commissioned the work. The parties, however, can agree that 
the ownership of the copyright shall pertain to either of them.
[125]

 The rule regarding commissioned works is modified under Republic Act 
No. 8293. Parties no longer have joint ownership over the copyright. 
Under Section 178.4 of Republic Act No. 8293, the copyright of a 
commissioned work generally belongs to the creator. However, the parties
 may agree in writing to transfer the copyright to the person who 
commissioned the work.
[126]
 

 In the present case, petitioner is not entitled to own the copyright 
because the designs were neither commissioned works nor works created in
 the course of respondent Tupaz's employment. First, although the 
parties verbally agreed to work together, petitioner did not hire 
respondent Tupaz's services for a fee or a commission. Respondent Tupaz 
rendered his services voluntarily.
[127]

 In other words, the new designs do not qualify as commissioned works. 
Second, there was no employer-employee relationship between the parties 
at the time the designs were made. 
 Petitioner could have avoided
 this dispute had it entered into a contract that clearly and expressly 
spelled out the extent of each party's rights over the new designs, as 
Presidential Decree No. 49 allows the transfer or assignment of the work
 and its copyright to other persons by gift, inheritance, or otherwise.
