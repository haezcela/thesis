CARANDANG, J.:


On appeal is the Decision
[1]
 dated September 27, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07976. The CA affirmed the Decision
[2]

 dated December 11, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court of the City of 
Manila, Branch 54 convicting accused-appellant Hermie Estolano
 y 

Castillo for violation of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1988
[3]
 as amended by Republic Act No. (R.A.) 9516.
[4]
 In an Information
[5]

 dated May 4, 2015, accused-appellant Hermie Estolano 
y
 Castillo 
(Estolano) was charged before the RTC in Criminal Case No. 15-315577, 
for violation of PD 1866 as amended by RA. 9516 for possessing a 
fragmentation hand grenade:
 That on or about April 17, 2015, in 
the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his
 custody and control one (1) MK2 Fragmentation Hand Grenade marked as 
"HEC", a device which is capable of destructive effect, with knowledge 
of its explosive or incendiary character, without first having secured 
from the proper authorities the necessary license thereof. 
 Contrary to law.
[6]
 (Emphasis omitted) 
 The prosecution tends to prove as follows: 

 On April 17, 2015, at around 6:15 a.m., members of the V. Mapa Police 
Station were at the comer of V. Mapa and Peralta streets of Sta. Mesa, 
Manila to conduct 
Oplan Sita
. PO3 Ruel Aguilar (PO3 Aguilar) saw a
 yellow Mitsubishi Lancer without a plate number. PO3 Aguilar flagged 
down the vehicle and approached Estolano who was driving the car. PO3 
Aguilar asked Estolano for his license and the registration documents of
 the car. Estolano failed to present anything. PO3 Aguilar ordered 
Estolano to alight from the vehicle. Estolano initially refused and 
acted as if he was trying to hide something in the pocket of his pants. 
Several minutes after, Estolano finally alighted from the vehicle.
[7]
 

 POI Sonny Boy Lubay (PO1 Lubay) approached Estolano to conduct a body 
search. While approaching, PO1 Lubay noticed that Estolano tried to get 
something from his right front pocket PO1 Lubay also saw Estolano hold 
the pin of a hand grenade placed inside Estolano's pocket Immediately, 
PO1 Lubay and PO1 Lucky Samson (PO1 Samson) grabbed the hands of 
Estolano to prevent him from holding the grenade causing possible 
explosion. Thereafter, the other police officers, including SPO2 Jayson 
Sanchez, PO3 Ronalda Robles, PO2 Patrick Guevarra, PO2 Ulysses San 
Diego, PO3 Ruel Aguilar, Police Inspector Lee Chui, and PO2 Eligio 
Valencia conducted a search on the vehicle where they recovered the 
plate number PFG-453. The police officers likewise noticed that the rear
 portion of the vehicle had an improvised plate with "SUPREMA" written 
on it.
[8]
 
The 
confiscated hand grenade was turned over to police investigator SPO1 
Benigno Lino Corado Jr. (SPO1 Corado Jr.), and then to SPO1 Allan 
Salinas (SPO1 Salinas) of the Explosives Ordnance Division of the Manila
 Police District. SPO1 Salinas placed a masking tape on the hand grenade
 and marked it with "HEC", the initials of Estolano.
[9]
 PO3 Aguilar and SPO1 Corado Jr. explained that they did not mark the hand grenade for fear that it might explode.
[10]
 In the meantime, PO1 Lubay brought Estolano to the Ospital ng Maynila for medical examination
[11]
 and eventually turned him over to Manila Police District - Police Station 8.
[12]


 On April 17, 2015, SPO1 Salinas issued a certificate
[13]

 stating that "the main components of [a] hand grenade such as [the] 
fuze assembly, the body, and explosive filler are all still intact and 
capable [of] explode[ing]."
[14]

 On November 10, 2015, P/C Supt. Elmo Francis O. Sarona (Supt. Sarona) 
of the Firearms and Explosives Office, Civil Security Group of the 
Philippine National Police issued a certification
[15]

 stating that Estolano "has not been issued a permit or license to 
possess/transport a hand grenade, military ordnance or any explosives/ 
explosive ingredients based on available records filed with this Office 
of this date."
[16]
 The charge was denied by Estolano.
[17]

 Estolano claims that on April 16, 2015, he attended a birthday 
celebration in Acacia Lane, Mandaluyong City. He left the party at past 
midnight and took the ride home with his friends Lou, Marivic, and 
Andrea. Estolano took the back seat with Marivic while Lou drove the 
Mitsubishi Lancer. Then, they were flagged down at the checkpoint 
located at the comer of V. Mapa and Peralta Streets. The police officer 
instructed Lou to park the vehicle on the right side of the road and 
ordered them to alight from the vehicle. Thereafter, the police officer 
told them to go inside the nearby police station for verification. The 
police officer following them said that a hand grenade was found inside 
their vehicle. Estolano was suddenly kicked at the stomach. He fell on 
his knees, and then to the ground with his face down. He was asked to go
 inside a room where he was instructed to hold the gun tucked on the 
waist of a police officer. Estolano refused. Another police officer 
asked him if he had a relative whom he could call for help. Estolano 
said that he could call his aunt working at the Office of the City 
Prosecutor. The police officer asked him to go outside the room. Asked 
if he knew the amount of bail for illegal possession of hand grenade and
 answering no, the police officer told him that the bail is 
P2,000,000.00. Estolano was asked to produce the said amount in exchange
 for his freedom. Meanwhile, Estolano saw Lou also enter the room. A 
lady who was crying then arrived. Estolano heard Lou telling the lady 
that he would take care of everything. Thereafter, Estolano was brought 
to the Ospital ng Maynila and then to the Manila Police District â 
Police Station 8 (Police Station 8). Estolano did not see Lou, Marivic, 
and Andrea in Police Station 8. He was later on informed by a police 
officer that Lou gave P120,000.00 to the police. Since he did not give 
money, only Estolano was charged with illegal possession of hand 
grenade.
[18]
 Estolano entered the plea of 
not guilty
.
 After trial, the RTC convicted Estolano of the offense charged. 
According to the trial court, the denial of the accused and the defense 
of frame-up cannot overcome the positive, categorical and clear 
testimonies of the police officers who enjoy the presumption that they 
performed their official duty with regularity. The RTC sentenced 
Estolano to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
[19]
 On appeal to the CA, the defense maintained that the RTC erred in convicting Estolano of illegal possession of hand grenade. 
First
,
 the defense attacked the credibility of PO1 Lubay's testimony because 
it is unimaginable for Estolano to simply place a dangerous weapon such 
as the hand grenade inside his pocket; at the very least, he could have 
placed the hand grenade inside the trunk of the car, far from the prying
 eyes of his friends and of the police.
[20]
 
Second
,
 the defense contended that the hand grenade is inadmissible in evidence
 for having been confiscated in an invalid warrantless search. 
Third
,
 the defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of
 illegal possession of firearms since no certification proving that 
Estolano has no authority to possess the hand grenade was presented at 
the time of the filing of the Information.
[21]
 The CA in its Decision
[22]

 dated September 27, 2018 affirmed Estolano's conviction and found that 
the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime 
charged. The existence of the hand grenade was established through the 
testimony of PO1 Lubay. PO1 Lubay and SPO1 Corrado, Jr. identified the 
hand grenade confiscated from Estolano. Further, the certification 
issued by the Philippine National Police (PNP) Firearms and Explosives 
Office states that Estolano had no license or permit to own or possess 
the hand grenade.
[23]
 The Public Attorney's Office manifested Estolano's intent to appeal in a Notice of Appeal.
[24]
 The Office of the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation
[25]
 dated December 10, 2019 stating that it will adopt the Appellee's Brief
[26]

 dated February 6, 2017 as its Supplemental Brief Likewise, the defense,
 through the Public Attorney's Office, filed its Manifestation in Lieu 
of Supplemental Brief
[27]
 dated November 25, 2019. 
 The theory of the prosecution was that the warrantless search was justified as part of the routine checkpoint 
Oplan Sita
,
 which falls under a valid warantless search on a moving vehicle. The 
scope of a valid warrantless search on moving vehicles, however, does 
not come without limitations. Jurisprudence has always insisted that the
 warrantless search on moving vehicles is not violative of the 
Constitution for only as long as the vehicle is neither searched nor its
 occupants subjected to a body search, and the inspection of the vehicle
 is merely limited to a visual search.
[28]

 An extensive search is allowed only if the officers conducting the 
search had probable cause to believe before the search that either the 
motorist was a law offender or that they would find evidence pertaining 
to the commission of a crime in the vehicle to be searched. 
 The Joint Affidavit of Apprehension
[29]

 submitted by the prosecution to the City Prosecutor of Manila, as well 
as PO1 Lubay's testimony, tells this Court that an extensive search was 
conducted. Nonetheless, the Court sees no circumstance that would 
justify the extensive search conducted in this case of Estolano. 
 
First
, the Court ruled in 
Mendoza v. People
[30]
 that the commission of a traffic violation does not justify the arrest of the accused. Under Section 29
[31]

 of R.A. 4136 or the Land Transportation Code, such violation merely 
warrant the confiscation of the offender's driver's license and issuance
 of a traffic violation receipt from the apprehending officer. The same 
procedure is found in the PNP Handbook which states that in flagging 
down or accosting 
vehicles
, "if it concerns traffic violations, 
immediately issue a Traffic Citation Ticket or Traffic Violation Report.
 Never indulge in prolonged, unnecessary conversation or argument with 
the driver or any of the vehicle's occupants."
[32]

 Furthermore, the PNP Guidebook on Human Rights-based Policing instructs
 that "[p]ersons stopped during a checkpoint are not required and must 
not be forced to answer any questions posed during spot checks or 
accosting. Failure to respond to an officer's inquiries is not, in and 
of itself, a sufficient ground to make an arrest. A person's failure or 
refusal to respond to questions made by the police officer, however, may
 provide sufficient justification for additional observation and 
investigation."
[33]
 Nothing in
 the said handbook authorizes the police officer to order the driver or 
passengers to alight the vehicle for a body search. Contrary to these 
rules and guidelines, Estolano was ordered by the police officers to 
alight from the vehicle that had no plate number. 
 
Second
,
 the search in this case cannot be classified as a search of a moving 
vehicle. In this particular type of warrantless search, the vehicle is 
the target and not a specific person. Further, in a search of a moving 
vehicle, the vehicle is intentionally used as a means to transport 
illegal items.
[34]
 In this case before the Court, the main target of the search was the 
person

 of Estolano before a search on the vehicle was even conducted. Worse, 
there was no information or tip relayed to the police officers about a 
crime, other than the traffic violation, that had just been committed or
 about to be committed. The police officers, therefore, had no probable 
cause to believe that they will find in the person of Estolano any 
instrument or evidence pertaining to a crime. 
 
Third
, it is worthy to note that the prosecution did not submit any evidence pertaining to 
Oplan Sita
.
 The Revised Philippine National Police Operational Procedures state 
that the establishment of checkpoints must always be authorized by the 
Head of Office of the territorial PNP Unit.
[35]

 In addition, the police and civilian components of the checkpoint 
operations must submit their respective after-operations report to their
 unit/organization.
[36]
 The 
prosecution failed to present anything related to these procedures on 
checkpoint operations. Thus, there is no proof that the checkpoint 
Oplan Sita
 actually took place.

 It must be remembered that warrantless searches are mere exceptions to 
the constitutional right of a person against unreasonable searches and 
seizures; thus, they must be strictly construed against the government 
and its agents. The prosecution is reasonably burdened to present every 
ounce of evidence in order to justify a warrantless search. While the 
power to search and seize is necessary to the public welfare, still it 
must be exercised and the law enforced, without transgressing the 
constitutional rights of the Filipino citizens. 
 The questionable
 conduct of the warrantless search and arrest left the Court with no 
alternative but to acquit Estolano of the offense charged against him. 
With the 
corpus delicti
 â the hand grenade allegedly confiscated 
from Estolano â inadmissible in evidence, there is simply no evidence 
against Estolano. The constitutionally enshrined presumption of 
innocence must be upheld and the accused must be exonerated as a matter 
of right.
[37]
