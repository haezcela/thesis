JUDGE JUANITA T. GUERRERO, COMPLAINANT,VS.ATTY. MA. ELEANOR LA-ARNI A. GIRON, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




ZALAMEDA, J.:


This administrative case stemmed from a letter-report
[1]

 dated 24 September 2015, submitted by Executive Judge Juanita T. 
Guerrero of the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa City before the 
Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC). The Executive Judge endorsed to the 
OBC, for appropriate action, the execution of notarial acts by 
respondent Atty. Ma. Eleanor La-Arni A. Giron despite expiration of her 
commission as notary public.


Antecedents


In the letter-report, Executive Judge Guerrero alleged that the 
Office of the Clerk of Court of Muntinlupa City conducted an inventory 
of its notarial records. Upon verification, respondent was found to have
 submitted notarial reports beyond the expired term of her notarial 
commission. Further, the dates appearing on the notarial stamps of the 
documents notarized by respondent, which should indicate the expiry date
 of her term, were erased or tampered with to make it appear that she 
still had a valid commission.
[2]
 


By Resolution
[3]
 dated 20 
January 2016, the Court required respondent to comment on the 
letter-report and referred this administrative case to Executive Judge 
Guerrero for further investigation, report, and recommendation.


In her comment, respondent asserted she believed in good faith that 
her notarial commission was valid and had yet to expire on 31 December 
2015 when she notarized the said documents. As respondent received the 
notarial commission on 27 September 2013, she was under the impression 
that her two (2)-year commission was for the years 2014 and 2015. 
Respondent apologized for her error in notarizing documents beyond the 
actual expiration of her commission on 31 December 2014. She had no 
intention of exercising her privileges as a notary public beyond the 
validity of her commission. Moreover, respondent averred it was the 
first and only time she applied for a notarial commission. She merely 
notarized a few documents exclusively for clients or members of her law 
firm. Respondent further submitted that her continued filing of a 
notarial report conclusively established her good faith.
[4]


Findings and Recommendation of the Executive Judge


In her Report/Recommendation dated 27 September 2017, Executive Judge
 Guerrero noted that respondent's appointment and commission as notary 
public was for a specified term beginning on 27 September 2013 and 
ending on 31 December 2014. While respondent claimed good faith, she was
 given a copy of her appointment which expressly provided that her 
commission as notary public for Muntinlupa City would end on 31 December
 2014. Also, the fact that the dates on the stamped portions of the 
notarized documents were erased or altered to make it appear that her 
term ends in 2015 belied her claim of good faith.
[5]
 


Contrary to respondent's claim that the documents involved were few 
and limited, the Executive Judge found that respondent notarized a total
 of twenty-eight (28) documents after the expiration of her term. 
Despite respondent's profuse apologies, she remains liable for violating
 the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice for performing notarial acts beyond
 the validity of her commission. Thus, the Executive Judge recommended 
respondent's disqualification from being commissioned as notary public 
for a period of two (2) years, with a warning that repetition of a 
similar violation will be dealt with severely.
[6]


Ruling of the Court


The Court agrees with the findings of the Executive Judge, except as to the recommended penalty.


Time and again, the Court has emphasized that notarization of 
documents is not an empty, meaningless routinary act but one invested 
with substantive public interest. The notarization by a notary public 
converts a private document into a public document, making it admissible
 in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. A notarized 
document is, by law, entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. It
 is for this reason that a notary public must observe with utmost care 
the basic requirements in the performance of his duties; otherwise, the 
public's confidence in the integrity of a notarized document would be 
undermined.
[7]
 


Without a commission, a lawyer is unauthorized to perform any of the 
notarial acts. A lawyer who acts as a notary public without the 
necessary notarial commission is remiss in his professional duties and 
responsibilities.
[8]
 


In the present case, respondent admittedly performed the notarial 
acts without a valid notarial commission. In her defense, respondent 
insists she acted in good faith since she believed her commission would 
actually expire on 31 December 2015. However, her claim of good faith is
 belied by the tampered dates on the stamps appearing in the notarized 
documents. On the stamped portions below her signature, it should 
indicate that her notarial commission was valid until 31 December 2014 
only. To make it appear that she still had a valid commission, the "4" 
in 2014 was altered by a "5," superimposed or handwritten over the 
original number.


With each act of tampering, respondent was constantly reminded that 
her commission was set to expire on 31 December 2014. If respondent 
truly acted in good faith, she could have easily checked the term of her
 commission since she was furnished a copy of her appointment. 
illtimately, the multiple acts of changing dates from 2014 to 2015 
exhibited bad faith and established respondent's intention to continue 
notarizing documents even with an expired notarial commission.


By performing notarial acts without the necessary commission from the
 court, respondent violated not only her oath to obey the laws, 
particularly the Rules on Notarial Practice, but also Canons 1 and 7 of 
the Code of Professional Responsibility, which proscribe all lawyers 
from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct and 
direct them to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession,
 at all times.
[9]
 


The Court, in 
Nunga v. Atty. Viray
,
[10]

 appropriately held that where the notarization of a document is done by
 a member of the Philippine Bar at a time when he has no authorization 
or commission to do so, the offender may be subjected to disciplinary 
action. For one, performing a notarial act without such commission is a 
violation of the lawyer's oath to obey the laws, more specifically, the 
Notarial Law. Then, too, by making it appear that he is duly 
commissioned when he is not, he is, for all legal intents and purposes, 
indulging in deliberate falsehood, which the lawyer's oath similarly 
proscribes. These violations fall squarely within the prohibition of 
Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which 
provides: "A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or 
deceitful conduct."
[11]


 In a long line of cases, the Court imposed serious disciplinary 
sanctions upon lawyers for notarizing documents with expired 
commissions. In 
Zoreta v. Atty. Simpliciano
,
[12]

 the respondent was, likewise, suspended from the practice of law for a 
period of two (2) years and was permanently barred from being 
commissioned as a notary public for notarizing several documents after 
the expiration of his commission. In the case of
 Judge Laquindanum v. Atty. Quintana
,
[13]

 the Court suspended a lawyer for six (6) months and was disqualified 
from being commissioned as notary public for a period of two (2) years 
because he notarized documents outside the area of his commission and 
with an expired commission. In 
Japitana v. Atty. Parada
,
[14]
 following the Court's pronouncements in 
Re: Violation of Rules on Notarial Practice
,
[15]

 the lawyer was suspended for two (2) years from the practice of law and
 forever barred from becoming a notary public when he notarized 
documents with no existing notarial commission. Finally, in the recent 
case of
 Spouses Frias v. Atty. Abao
,
[16]

 a lawyer who performed the notarial act without the required commission
 was also suspended from the practice of law for two (2) years and 
permanently barred from being commissioned as notary public.
[17]


 Considering respondent's act of notarizing documents without 
requisite authority, coupled with the tampering of the stamped dates to 
make it appear she still had a valid commission, the Court finds the 
recommended penalty insufficient. Instead, respondent must be 
permanently barred from being commissioned as notary public and 
suspended from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years.


 
WHEREFORE
, respondent Atty. Ma. Eleanor La-Ami A. Giron is found 
GUILTY

as well as Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional 
Responsibility. Accordingly, she is 
SUSPENDED
 from the practice of law for two (2) years and 
BARRED PERMANENTLY
 from being commissioned as Notary Public, with warning that a repetition of similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.

 Eleanor La-Arni A. Giron. She shall inform this Court and the Office of
 the Bar Confidant in writing of the date she received a copy of this

Bar Confidant, to be appended to respondent's personal record, and the 
Integrated Bar of the Philippines. The Office of the Court Administrator
 is directed to circulate copies of this Decision to all courts 
concerned.
