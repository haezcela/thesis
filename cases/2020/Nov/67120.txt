69,974 square meters (sq.m.) and Lot 3, Lot 45749, with an area of 
12,859 sq.m. filed a petition for injunction
[4]

 (Civil Case No. 2007-104) against petitioner AFP, Fourth Infantry 
Division (4ID), Philippine Army (PA), Camp Edilberto Evangelista. 
  
 A separate petition
[5]

 (Civil Case No. 2007-152), likewise for injunction, was filed on June 
27, 2007 by respondents Rogelio C. SerquiÃ±a, Elizabeth Suganob, Apolonio
 Suganob, Melia C. Aso, Helen D. Centeno, Loreto Salomon, Eduardo

SeÃ±eres, Flordeliza de Jesus, Asuncion Jacalan and Nicolas Pogay, all 
actual occupants of Lot 4, Lot 45750 with an area of 1,417 sq.m., Lot 5,
 Lot 45751 with an area of 4,739 sq.m. and Lot 6, Lot 45752 with an area
 of 2,462 sq. m. of Lots 22052 and 4353, CAD 237, likewise located in 
Cagayan de Oro City, also against petitioner AFP, 4ID, PA. 
  
 In both petitions for injunction, respondents averred that 
they and their predecessors-in-interest are the lawful occupants of the 
subject parcels of land for more than 30 years; their lands are outside 
the Philippine Army's Camp Edilberto Evangelista, a 32-hectare land 
given to petitioner by the Velezes; and they, as early as November 9, 
1995, filed a petition to the President of the Philippines for the 
segregation and release thereof on the ground that these are outside the
 property of the petitioner.
[6]

 Respondents further narrated that sometime in 2007, they received a 
notice to vacate their respective areas within a period of two months. 
Respondents, however, did not give heed to petitioner's demand. As a 
result, thereof, petitioner harrassed respondents and unceremoniously 
closed some of their stores. Respondents, thus, sought to enjoin 
petitioner from closing their stores and from disturbing their lawful 
and peaceful possession of the subject parcels of land.
[7]
 
 In its answer (with counterclairn),
[8]
 petitioner contended that respondents are all squatters in a military reservation, hence, they are considered as nuisances 
per se
 and may be subjected to summary abatement.
[9]

 Petitioner explained further that it is the lawful owner of the subject
 parcels of land considering that the land was sold to its favor by 
Apolinar Velez in 1936; and that such sale was acknowledged by the 
Velezes and Pinedas in their respective deeds of donation and quitclaim.
[10]
 
RTC Ruling


 The RTC rendered the October 29, 2008 Order
[11]

 granting respondents' petitions for injunction. It ratiocinated that 
based on the relocation/verification report of Engr. Arlene Galope and 
the supplemental report of Director Dichoso of the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the subject parcels of land 
are not only outside the 36-hectare property of petitioner but are also 
considered alienable and disposable.
[12]

 The trial court further concluded that since respondents are in actual 
possession of the subject parcels of land since time immemorial, they 
have a clear and unmistakable right over the subject property, which 
must be protected. The trial court, thus, disposed the case in this 
wise: 
  


 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the injunctive writ 
prayed for by plaintiffs â prohibitory injunction is hereby GRANTED for 
being meritorious. Accordingly, defendants 4
th
 Infantry 
Division, Philippine Army, represented by its Officers and personnel and
 defendants in their own rights, Major General Jose T. Barbieto, Jr., 
AFP Commanding General, 4
th
 ID PA; Col. Augusto L. Tolentino,
 PA, Chief of Staff 4ID, PA; LTC Rex G. Gatiologo, PA, Camp Commander, 
4ID, PA; LTC Silver P. Linsangan, PA, Division Adjutant; Major Crispin 
O. Mendoza, Jr., PA, Commanding Officer, Post Engineering Detachment 
(PED), 4ID, PA; and Capt. Eduardo AbaÃ±o, PA, Division Real Estate 
Officer (DREO), 4ID, PA, and all persons acting for and in their behalf,
 are hereby ordered to cease and desist in their summary eviction of 
plaintiffs, and cease and desist in harassing the plaintiffs; open all 
stores of some plaintiffs which were closed without due process and 
remove the wooden structures indicating the closure. 


 Considering that the main cause for action of the instant 
complaints/petitions is injunction, with the granting of the same by the
 Court, the bond put up by the plaintiffs in the sum of One Hundred 
Thousand (P100,000.00) pesos under Official Receipt No. 0847126A re: 
temporary restraining order issued by the Court dated July 8, 2008, is 
hereby ordered cancelled and returned to the bondsmen Enelida Amogod and
 Rogelio C. SerquiÃ±a. 


 SO ORDERED.
[13]




 Undaunted, petitioner filed an appeal to the CA. 
 
CA Ruling


 In a Decision promulgated on August 22, 2013, the CA affirmed the RTC Decision, the decretal portion of which reads: 
  


 
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the appeal is hereby 
DENIED

 for lack of merit. The assailed Decision rendered by the Regional Trial
 Court in Civil Case Nos. 2007-104 and 2007-152 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
. 


 No costs. 


 SO ORDERED.
[14]




 The CA based its decision mainly on the September 21, 2010 Order 
of the Regional Executive Director (RED) of DENR-Region X which granted 
respondents' petition for exclusion and segregation. In the said Order, 
the DENR concluded that, after evaluation of the documentary evidence of
 respondents, as well as the findings of the ocular inspection conducted
 over the lots in question, the subject parcels of land are deemed 
alienable and disposable. As such, respondents, being the actual 
occupants thereon, have the right to apply for segregation and 
exclusion. The DENR, likewise, found the deeds of donation and quitclaim
 executed by the Velezes and the Pinedas without value considering that 
no acceptance thereof was made by petitioner. Accordingly, the CA ruled 
that as between petitioner and respondents, the latter has a clear and 
unmistakable right over the subject parcels of land.
[15]
 Aggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration. It was, however, denied in a Resolution
[16]
 dated July 30, 2014, 
 Hence, the instant petition for review on
 certiorari 
interposing a lone issue.
 
Issue




 
Whether or not the Court of Appeals, in CA-GR CV No. 
01833-MIN, seriously erred in sustaining, through its herein challenged 
August 22, 2013 Decision and July 30, 2014 Resolution, the Regional 
Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 39 which, in Civil Case No. 
2007-104 and 2007-152, granted (sic) the complaints/petitions below, 
through its October 29, 2008 and January 8, 2009 Orders
.
[17]




 
Court's Ruling


 The petition is meritorious. 
 It must be stressed at 
the outset that the main issue involved in the instant petition is 
whether the issuance or non-issuance of a 
writ
 of injunction is 
warranted in the case. Notwithstanding, a determination as to who 
between the parties have the legal right over the subject property is  
necessary before arriving at a proper and legally sound conclusion. 

 In the instant petition, petitioner AFP, 4ID, PA insists that although 
the subject property is outside their military reservation, it is still 
within the area covered by the quitclaim and donation executed by the 
Velezes and Pinedas in its favor; this is confirmed by the Secretary of 
DENR in his August 8, 2013 Decision
[18]

 which in turn, reversed the RED's September 21, 2010 Order. Petitioner 
further claims that with the issuance of the DENR Secretary's August 8, 
2013 Decision, respondents' occupation of the subject property no longer
 has any legal basis, hence, a writ of injunction is no longer 
warranted; thus, petitioner may now summarily evict respondents 
therefrom. 
 Respondents, on the other hand, claim that the appeal
 to the DENR Secretary was made out of time. They further aver that the 
donation and quitclaim executed in petitioner's favor were invalid 
considering that it failed to make an acceptance thereof. Simply, 
respondents insist that they, being the actual occupants of the subject 
property, declared as disposable and alienable, have the right not to be
 disturbed from their peaceful possession of the disputed lands.
[19]
 This Court rules in favor of the petitioner. 

 Settled is the rule that a petition for injunction may be the principal
 action and not merely an ancillary to a main case. This has been the 
ruling of the Court in the case of Sangguniang 
Panglunsod ng Baguio City v. Jadewell Parking Systems, Corporation
,
[20]
 to wit: 
  


 An action for inunction is a recognized remedy in this 
jurisdiction. It is a suit for the purpose of enjoining the defendant, 
perpetually or for a particular time, from committing or continuing to 
commit a specific act, or compelling the defendant to continue 
performing a particular act. It has an independent existence. The action
 for injunction is distinct from the ancillary remedy of preliminary 
injunction, which cannot exist except only as part or an incident of an 
independent action or proceeding.
[21]




 Now, Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, enumerates the grounds for the issuance of a 
writ
 of preliminary injunction (WPI), whether prohibitive or mandatory, 
viz
.: 
  


 SEC. 3. 
Grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction
. - A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established: 


 (a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and 
the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission 
or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the 
performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or 
perpetually; 


 (b) That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the 
act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work 
injustice to the applicant; or


 (c) That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, 
threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be 
done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the 
applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and 
tending to render the judgment ineffectual." 




 Section 5 thereof further provides: 
  


 Sec. 5. 
Preliminary injunction not granted without notice; exception
.
 - No preliminary injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior 
notice to the party or person sought to be enjoined. If it shall appear 
from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified application that great
 or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter 
can be heard on notice, the court to which the application for 
preliminary injunction was made may issue a temporary restraining order 
to be effective only for a period of twenty (20) days from notice to the
 party or person sought to be enjoined. Within the said twenty-day 
period, the court must order said party or person to show cause, at a 
specified time and place, why the injunction should not be granted, 
determine within the same period whether or not the preliminary 
injunction shall be granted, and accordingly issue the corresponding 
order. 


 However, and subject to the provisions of the preceding 
sections, if the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will 
suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive judge of a 
multiple-sala court or the presiding judge of a single-sala court may 
issue 
ex parte
 a temporary restraining order effective for only 
seventy-two (72) hours from issuance but he shall immediately comply 
with the provisions of the next preceding section as to service of 
summons and the documents to be served therewith. Thereafter, within the
 aforesaid seventy-two (72) hours, the judge before whom the case is 
pending shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the 
temporary restraining order shall be extended until the application for 
preliminary injunction can be heard. In no case shall the total period 
of effectivity of the temporary restraining order exceed twenty (20) 
days, including the original seventy-two hours provided herein. 


 In the event that the application for preliminary injunction is 
denied or not resolved within the said period, the temporary restraining
 order is deemed automatically vacated. The effectivity of a temporary 
restraining order is not extendible without need of any judicial 
declaration to that effect and no court shall have authority to extend 
or renew the same on the same ground for which it was issued. 


 However, if issued by the Court of Appeals or a member thereof, 
the temporary restraining order shall be effective for sixty (60) days 
from notice to the party or person sought to be enjoined. A restraining 
order issued by the Supreme Court or a member thereof shall be effective
 until further orders. 




 From the foregoing provisions, it is clear that the following 
elements must be present before a writ of preliminary injunction or a 
writ of injunction may be issued, to wit: (a) extreme urgency, and (b) 
grave and irreparable injury will be suffered by the applicant. 
 In addition, the Court in the case of 
European Resources and Technologies, Inc, et. al. v. Ingenieuburo Birkhahn +Nolte, et. al
.,
[22]
 ruled that prior to the issuance of a WPI, the existence of some requirements must be proved, to wit: 
  


 Before an injunctive writ can be issued, it is essential that 
the following requisites are present: (1) there must be a right in esse 
or the existence of a right to be protected; and (2) the act against 
which injunction to be directed is a violation of such right. The onus 
probandi is on movant to show that there exists a right to be protected,
 which is directly threatened by the act sought to be enjoined. Further,
 there must be a showing that the invasion of the right is material and 
substantial and that there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the 
writ to prevent a serious damage. Thus, it is clear that for the 
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction to be proper, it must be 
shown that the invasion of the right sought to be protected is material 
and substantial, that the right of complainant is clear and unmistakable
 and that there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to 
prevent serious damage.
[23]
 




 The foregoing requisites were synthesized in the case of 
Lukang v. Pagbilao Development Corporation, et. al.
, 
[24]
 where the Court explained: 
  


 A writ of preliminary injunction is a provisional remedy which 
is adjunct to a main suit, as well as a preservative remedy issued to 
maintain the status quo of the things subject of the action or the 
relations between the parties during the pendency of the suit. The 
purpose of injunction is to prevent threatened or continuous 
irremediable injury to the parties before their claims can be thoroughly
 studied and educated. Its sole aim is to preserve the status quo until 
the merits of the case are fully heard. Under Section 3, Rule 58 of the 
Rules of Court, an application for a writ of preliminary injunction may 
be granted if the following grounds are established: 




 (a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and
 the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission
 or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the 
performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or 
perpetually; 


 (b) That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the
 act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work 
injustice to the applicant; or


 (c) That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, 
threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be 
done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the 
applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and 
tending to render the judgment ineffectual. 




 Thus, a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued upon the concurrence of the following essential requisites, to wit: 
(a)
 the invasion of right sought to be protected is material and 
substantial; (b) the right of the complainant is clear and unmistakable;
 and (c) there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to 
prevent serious damage.
"
[25]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 After a careful review and evaluation of the records of this case,
 vis-a-vis

 the arguments raised by the parties, this Court finds that the elements
 for the issuance of writ preliminary injunction and/or writ of 
injunction are wanting in this case. 
  




Respondents have no clear and unmistakable right over the subject property.
 






To recall, respondents' right over the subject property is anchored
 on the fact that they are the actual occupants thereon, as well as, on 
their contention that such is outside the property of petitioner. While 
their actual possession of the subject property has been established, 
the ownership thereof is still the subject of litigation. The DENR 
Secretary, however, in his Decision dated August 8, 2013 made a 
pronouncement that petitioner, not the respondents, has a better right 
to the disputed subject property, 
viz
.: 
  


 The appealed Decision correctly pointed out that appellees are 
the actual occupants of the disputed lots. However, the records did not 
show that [respondent's] entry was legal. There was also no showing that
 [respondent's] possession was in the concept of an owner. Hence, it was
 erroneous for the RED to give appellees preferential rights to the 
disputed lots. The law giving preferential rights to actual occupants is
 not designed to encourage, condone and reward illegal settlers. 
Moreover, it must be stressed that the law on preferential rights of 
actual occupants was not designed to defeat or nullify the legal title 
or the vested right of the lawful possessor of the land involved, 
because it would [be] tantamount to a taking without just compensation. 


 Unlike appellees, appellant (petitioner herein) was able to 
adduce evidence to support its claim over the controverted lots. 
Appellant submitted the following evidence:(1) the Quitclaim Deed of the
 Heirs of Apolinar Velez dated 28 December 1951; (2) the Quitclaim Deed 
of Hernando Pineda dated 22 December 1951; (3) the invalid Deed of 
Donation executed by the Heirs of Apolinar Velez dated 20 September 
1960; (4) the Tax Declaration No. 198089; (5) the Land History Card of 
Lot 4319 in the Cadastral Records showing Apolinar Velez as Cadastral 
Claimant of said lot; and (6) the Consolidation/Subdivision Plan No. 
10-001013. 


 On the basis of the above evidence, it is the considered opinion
 of this Office that appellant has a better right to the disputed lots 
than appellees.
[26]




 Admittedly, while opinions of administrative bodies are not 
controlling to this Court, administrative decisions on matters within 
their jurisdiction are entitled to respect and can only be set aside on 
proof of grave abuse of discretion, fraud or error of law.
[27]

 Otherwise stated, unless it is shown that the DENR Secretary has acted 
in a wanton, whimsical, or oppressive manner, giving undue advantage to a
 party or for an illegal consideration and similar reasons, this Court 
is inclined to be guided by the Secretary's conclusion. Moreover, the 
DENR Secretary, in the instant case, reviewed the evidence, both 
testimonial and documentary, submitted by both parties before arriving 
at the said ruling. It is worthy to note that this evidence were the 
same pieces of evidence adduced by the parties in the instant case to 
support their respective claims. Hence, this Court finds no reason to 
deviate from the DENR Secretary's ruling. 
  
 Be that as it may, even without considering the DENR 
Secretary's Decision, this Court is still constrained to overturn the 
ruling of the CA in respondents' favor. 
 To prove ownership over 
the subject parcels of land, petitioner presented and offered as 
evidence the following documents: (1) Quitclaim Deed executed by the 
Velezes;
[28]
 (2) the Land History Card of Lot No. 4319;
[29]
 (3) Tax Declaration No. 198089;
[30]
 (4) Deed of Donation executed by the Velezes;
[31]
 (5) Quitclaim Deed executed by the Pinedas;
[32]
 (6) Consolidation/Subdivision Plan No. Ccs-10-001013
[33]
 duly approved by the Land Management Services, DENR; and (7) Supplemental Relocation Survey Report.
[34]
 Based on the Quitclaim Deed
[35]
 executed by the Velezes, as well as the Quitclaim Deed
[36]

 executed by the Pinedas, both in 1951, the disputed parcels of land 
were already sold to petitioner AFP as early as 1936. It is for this 
reason that the Deed of Donation executed by the Velezes in 1960 are 
considered invalid. The object of their donation are the very same 
parcels of land already sold in 1936. Simply, the Velezes and the 
Pinedas could not have donated the disputed lands since as early as 
1936, these subject properties were already sold to petitioner. Despite 
the invalidity of the donation, the sale of the subject properties in 
favor of petitioner was acknowledged in these deeds of donation. It, 
thus, supports the fact that a sale thereof was executed in favor of 
petitioner. 
 Further solidifying petitioner's claim of ownership 
is their consistent declaration of the subject property for tax 
purposes. While it is true that tax receipts and tax declarations are 
not incontrovertible evidence of ownership, they constitute credible 
proof of a claim of title over the property.
[37]
 Finally, the duly approved consolidation plan, 
vis-a-vis

 the Supplemental Relocation Survey Report from the DENR fortify 
petitioner's claim of ownership. The pertinent portion of the Survey 
Report reads: 
  


 That it is hereby informed that the area subject of the 
relocation survey which is the Consolidation/subdivision plan of Lots 
22052 and 4353, Cad 237, Ccs-10-001013 is outside the Military 
Reservation under Presidential Proclamation No. 265, which are Lot Nos. 
4318, 4354 and 4357, all of Cad. 237, Cagayan Cadastre. However, the 
same relocated area covered by the Deed of Quitclaim by the Velez'es, 
Deed of Donations by the Velez'es and Affidavit of Quitclaim by Hermundo
 Pineda, all in favor of the Philippine Army, executed on December 26, 
1951, September 20, 1960 and December 22, 1951, respectively, copies 
attached for reference. In fact, a previous plan Pcs-3919 was approved 
by the Bureau of Lands confirming the claims of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines covering Lot 1. The same was surveyed for the Republic of 
the Philippines. 


 That Lot 2, identified to Lot 45748, Cad. 237; Lot 3, identical 
to Lot 45749, Cad. 237; Lot 7, identical to Lot 45753, Cad. 237; Lot 8, 
identical to Lot 45755, Cad. 237, all of plan Ccs-10-001013 are outside 
the Military Reservation under PP No. 265 but inside the area subject of
 the Deed of Quitclaim and Deeds of Donation by the Velez'es executed on
 December 26, 1951 and September 20, 1951. The same are occupied by as 
follows: the herein plaintiffs of Civil Case Nos. 2007-104 & 2007-38
 utilized as their residence for a long time, National Food Authority 
Bodega for a long time, Regional Training Division & Special Forces 
Company for a long time and 4
th
 LD. Used as a Mosque, respectively. 


 That Lot 4, identical to Lot 45750, Cad. 237; Lot 5, identical 
to Lot 45752, Cad. 237, all of plan Ccs-10-001013 are outside the 
Military Reservation but inside the area subject of a Affidavit of 
Quitclaim by Hernando Pineda executed on December 22, 1951. The same 
area are occupied by herein plaintiffs of Civil Case No. 2007-152 and 
are utilized as their residence for a long period of time.
[38]




 Based on this Survey Report, the DENR confirmed that the disputed 
lands, while outside petitioner's Military Reservation, are the subject 
of Deeds of Quitclaim executed by the Velezes and Pinedas in favor of 
petitioner sometime in 1951.
 Respondents, on the other hand, rely
 on acquisitive prescription contending that they have been in actual 
possession of the subject property for more than 30 years. While they 
are indeed the actual occupants of the disputed parcels of land, they, 
unfortunately, failed to establish that such possession was in the 
concept of an owner. Worse, records are bereft of any showing of the 
legality of their entry into the subject lands. Respondents likewise 
failed to state the date when they entered and occupied the subject 
property. 
 Despite having actual possession of the disputed lands
 allegedly for more than 30 years, however, respondents' possession did 
not and will not ripen to ownership. This is pursuant to the established
 rule that while acquisitive prescription is a mode of ownership, 
possession by mere tolerance does not start the running of the 
prescriptive period.
[39]
 Thus,
 lawful owners have the right to demand the return of their property at 
any time as long as the possession was unauthorized or merely tolerated.
 This right is never barred by laches, because possession by mere 
tolerance does not start the running of the prescriptive period.
[40]
 This was exhaustively explained in the case of 
Heirs of Jarque v. Jarque
,
[41]
 to wit: 
  


 Acquisitive prescription is a mode of acquiring ownership by a possessor through the requisite lapse of time. 
In order to ripen into ownership, possession must be in the concept of an owner, public, peaceful and uninterrupted.

 Thus, mere possession with a juridical title, such as, to exemplify, by
 a usufructuary, a trustee, a lessee, an agent or a pledgee, not being 
in the concept of an owner, cannot ripen into ownership by acquisitive 
prescription, unless the juridical relation is first expressly 
repudiated and such repudiation has been communicated to the other 
party. 
Acts of possessory character executed due to license or by 
mere tolerance of the owner would likewise be inadequate. Possession, to
 constitute the foundation of a prescriptive right, must be 
en concepto de duno
,
 or, to use the common law equivalent of the term, that possession 
should be adverse, if not, such possessory acts, no matter how long, do 
not start the running of the period of prescription.
[42]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Viewed in light of all the foregoing, as between petitioner and 
respondents, this Court holds and so rules that it is petitioner who has
 a better right over the subject parcels of land. Respondents, 
therefore, have no clear and unmistakable right over the subject 
properties. Corollarily, there is no invasion of a purported right that 
needs to be protected. A Writ of Injunction is, therefore, unwarranted 
in this case. 
  




Petitioner cannot summarily abate or evict respondents from the disputed lands.
 






Petitioner contends that respondents' illegal occupation of the 
subject parcels of land is considered nuisance per se. Hence, it may be 
summarily abated even without judicial order. It further avers that 
under Section 28 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7279, or the Urban 
Development and Housing Act of 1992, petitioner may summarily evict 
respondents, and their homes summarily demolished. 
  
 These contentions, however, are unmeritorious. 
 Despite
 having the right of possession over the subject parcels of land, 
petitioner cannot summarily abate and/or evict respondents therefrom. 
Neither can petitioner close and padlock the stores of respondents. 
 Firstly, respondents cannot be considered nuisance 
per se
.
 Article 694 of the Civil Code defines a nuisance as any act, omission, 
establishment, business, condition of property, or anything else which: 
(1) injures or endangers the health or safety of others; (2) annoys or 
offends the senses; (3) shocks, defies or disregards decency or 
morality; (4) obstructs or interferes with the free passage of any 
public highway or street, or any body of water; or (5) hinders or 
impairs the use of property. 
 The Court recognizes two kinds of nuisances. In 
Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc.
,
[43]
 the Court made this distinction, "nuisance 
per se

 is one recognized as a nuisance under any and all circumstances, 
because it constitutes a direct menace to public health or safety, and, 
for that reason, may be abated summarily under the undefined law of 
necessity. The second, nuisance 
per accidens
, is that which 
depends upon certain conditions and circumstances, and its existence 
being a question of fact, it cannot be abated without due hearing 
thereon in a tribunal authorized to decide whether such a thing in law 
constitutes a nuisance."
[44]
 
 It can easily be gleaned that respondents' occupation of the disputed lands is not a nuisance 
per se
.
 This Court agrees with the CA that the residential houses and stores 
built and occupied by respondents cannot be considered as a nuisance 
per se

 because, by their very nature, they are not a "direct menace to public 
health or safety." They were built merely for residential purposes. 
Thus, their summary abatement is unwarranted. 
 Secondly, under 
Section 28 of R.A. No. 7279, there are only three situations where 
summary eviction and demolition of underprivileged and homeless citizens
 and their residential structures may be allowed: (1) when persons or 
entities occupy danger areas such as esteros, railroad tracks, garbage 
dumps, riverbanks, shorelines, waterways, and other public places such 
as sidewalks, roads, parks, and playgrounds; (2) when government 
infrastructure projects with available funding are about to be 
implemented; and (3) when there is a court order for eviction and 
demolition. This case, however, does not fall within the ambit of any of
 these instances. 
 The disputed lands cannot be considered one of
 or similar to the enumerated danger areas. There is likewise no court 
order for eviction and/or demolition. Furthermore, records are bereft of
 any showing that the disputed lands are subject of an infrastructure 
project with available funding. While petitioner claimed that the 
subject lands were dedicated for the quarters of its personnel 
temporarily assigned to it, no evidence whatsoever was ever presented to
 prove that there was indeed a concrete plan to construct the said 
infrastructure project and that funds were already available therefor. 
Petitioner's assertion that it may summarily abate and evict respondents
 from the disputed lands, therefore, has no bases, both in fact and in 
law. 
  




Section 1, Presidential Decree No. 1227 is inapplicable to this case.
 






Finally, petitioner claims that respondents violated and are 
violating Section l of Presidential Decree No. 1227 by entering and 
re-entering Camp Evangelista, where the subject parcels of land are 
located. 
  
 Such contention, however, is misplaced. 
 Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1227
[45]

 proscribes and sanctions anyone who re-enters a military base after 
having been removed therefrom and ordered not to re-enter by the base 
commander. This provision, however, finds no application to the instant 
case. 
 The subject parcels of land are not within the premises of
 petitioner's military base. As clearly stated in the Supplemental 
Relocation Survey Report from the DENR, "the area subject of the 
relocation survey x x x is outside the Military Reservation under 
Presidential Proclamation No. 265 x x x." While the disputed lands 
belong to petitioner, they are not, at least for the time being, a part 
of its military base. Respondents' occupation of the subject parcels of 
land, therefore, is not tantamount to entry to a military base. 
 
All told, the RTC and the CA committed reversible error when it granted 
respondents' petitions and issued a Writ of Injunction to enjoin 
petitioner from evicting respondents and demolishing their houses and 
stores. From the evidence presented, petitioner was able to prove that 
it has the legal right over the disputed lands. Meanwhile, respondents' 
possession thereof, despite the lapse of time, did not ripen to 
ownership. This, however, does not necessarily give petitioner the 
unbridled right to summarily abate and/or evict respondents from the 
disputed lands. Compliance with the pertinent laws and rules still needs
 to be observed. 
  
 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing premises, the instant petition for review on
 certiorari
 is 
GRANTED
