INTING, J.:


This is an appeal
[1]
 from the Decision
[2]

 dated April 26, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 
01666-MIN. The assailed CA Decision affirmed the Decision
[3]
 dated January 17, 2017 of Branch 26, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Surallah, South Cotabato finding Loreto Talmesa 
y

 Bagan (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime 
of Rape under paragraph 1, Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of
 the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8353.
[4]
 
The Antecedents


 This case stemmed from an Information
[5]
 filed before the RTC charging accused-appellant with Rape under paragraph 1, Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended, to wit:
  


 That on or about the 21
st
 day of December 2011, at around  10:30 o'clock in the evening, in 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
,
  Province of South Cotabato, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force and violence, 
have carnal knowledge of the herein victim, [AAA],
[6]
 then seventeen (17) years old, against her will and without her consent.


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[7]




 Accused-appellant, with the assistance of his counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
[8]
 Trial on the merits ensued. 

 The prosecution presented as witnesses the following: (1) AAA, the 
minor victim; (2) BBB, AAA's uncle; (3) Police Officer III Ronald 
Garcia, the investigator assigned to the case; and (4) Dr. Mila G. 
Quinton, MD (Dr. Quinton), the physician who examined AAA after the rape
 incident.
[9]
 AAA was 17 years old at the time of the rape incident. Accused-appellant and AAA reside in the same 
barangay
. AAA is very familiar with accused-appellant because she would see him every time she goes to work.
[10]


 According to AAA, on  December 21, 2011,  at around 8:00 p.m. to  9:00 p.m., she was at the shed of  
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

  waiting for her father to fetch her. Accused-appellant asked AAA who 
she was waiting for; she replied that she was waiting for her father. 
Accused-appellant then left. As AAA's father did not arrive and it was 
already 10:30 p.m., AAA decided to go home. While she was walking on her
 way home, a person suddenly covered her mouth and pulled her from 
behind. She immediately turned to see the person and saw 
accused-appellant's face through the light coming from her cellphone 
that she held above her head. While accused-appellant was holding her, 
AAA struggled to free herself. Accused-appellant dragged her towards the
 middle of the rice field. As accused-appellant was much bigger, AAA 
struggled to free herself from accused-appellant, causing her to fall. 
While she was lying on the muddy ground, accused-appellant sat on her 
knees and repeatedly punched her on the face and lower parts of her 
body. AAA tried to evade the blows by covering her face, but she could 
not do anything.
[11]


 Thereafter, accused-appellant forcibly removed AAA's pants and
 underwear and tried to kiss her. AAA evaded accused-appellant's 
attempts and pushed his head away from her. Accused-appellant, who was 
naked at that time, spread AAA's legs and inserted a part of his penis 
into her vagina. AAA kept on kicking accused-appellant causing his penis
 to be removed from her vagina. This enraged accused-appellant. He 
punched her on her stomach, abdomen, head, and neck several times. AAA 
retaliated by biting accused-appellant's hand. She also shouted for 
help. Accused-appellant punched her again on the head and abdomen until 
she nearly lost consciousness. Then, AAA heard a motorcycle approaching 
the rice field making accused-appellant to run away from the scene. AAA 
slowly crawled her way out from the muddy rice field towards the road 
and asked for help. Upon reaching the road, AAA saw the motorcycle. She 
waved her hand and shouted for help. The persons on board the motorcycle
 saw her and helped her. BBB was one of the three persons on board the 
motorcycle. After asking AAA what happened to her, BBB gave his shawl to
 her to cover the lower part of her naked body. In no time, BBB brought 
AAA to the police station and thereafter to the hospital for treatment.
[12]

 Dr. Quinton, the attending physician of AAA, testified that on December
 22, 2011, AAA was brought to the hospital shivering, wearing  a blouse,
 but no lower clothes. When she examined AAA, she found the following: 
(1) multiple abrasions in AAA's neck and face; (2) contusion on the 
upper lip; (3) hemorrhages on both eyes; (4) contused abrasion on her 
upper 
labia minora
; and (4) fresh lacerated wound in the hymen.
[13]

 For his part, accused-appellant denied the allegations against him. He 
claimed that at around 6:00 p.m. of December 21, 2011, after having 
dinner with his wife and one Jose Regidor, he drank half a bottle of 
Tanduay and went to sleep at 9:00 that evening. At around 6:00 a.m. the 
following day, while drinking his coffee, four police officers 
approached and asked him whether he noticed something odd the previous 
night. Accused-appellant told them that the dogs were barking that night
 The police officers invited him to the police station to get his 
statements. He agreed and freely went with the police officers. However,
 he was instead brought to a hospital where he was presented before AAA 
who was asked whether he was the one who raped her. AAA just looked at 
him and sat down. AAA did not point to him as the one who raped her. The
 police officers told accused-appellant to board the patrol car and that
 they would go home. However, he was not brought home, but to the police
 station where one of the police officers pushed him inside the jail. 
Upon the instruction of a police officer, the detainees inside mauled 
him.
[14]
 
The RTC Ruling


 In the Decision
[15]
 
dated January 17, 2017, the RTC found accused-appellant guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined in paragraph 1(a), 
Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended. The RTC sentenced him to suffer 
the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, and ordered him to pay AAA P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.
 Accused-appellant appealed to the CA.
 
The CA Ruling


 On April 26, 2018, the CA affirmed
 in toto 
the RTC ruling.
 Hence, the instant appeal.

 The parties adopted their respective Appellant's and Appellee's Briefs 
filed before the CA as their respective Supplemental Briefs before the 
Court. 
[16]
 In his appeal, accused-appellant raised the following grounds questioning his conviction before the lower courts: 
  






1.


He was unlawfully arrested without a warrant;






 


 






2.


He was not positively identified by AAA; and






 


 






3.


AAA's statements were peppered with inconsistencies which when considered would have changed the judgment of the RTC. 






The Court's Ruling




 The appeal has no merit. 
 Well settled is the rule that the
 matter of ascribing substance to the testimonies of witnesses is best 
discharged by the trial court, and the appellate courts will not 
generally disturb the findings of the trial court in this respect.
[17]

 Findings of the trial court which are factual in nature and which 
involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded with respect, if not 
finality by the appellate court, when no glaring errors, gross 
misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported 
conclusions can be gathered from such findings.
[18]

 The reason is quite simple: the trial judge is in a better position to 
ascertain the conflicting testimonies of witnesses after having heard 
them and observed their deportment and mode of testifying during the 
trial.
[19]
 The task of taking on the issue of credibility is a function properly lodged with the trial court.
[20]
 Thus, generally, the Court will not reexamine or reevaluate evidence that had been analyzed and ruled upon by the trial court.

 After a judicious perusal of the records of the instant appeal, the 
Court finds no compelling reason to depart from the uniform factual 
findings of the RTC and the CA. The Court affirms accused-appellant's 
conviction. 
  




All the elements of the crime of rape are present
. 






Accused-appellant is indicted for rape under paragraph 1, Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended, which provides as follows: 
  


 Article 266-A.
 Rape:
 
When And How Committed
. â Rape is committed â


 1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:


 a) Through force, threat, or intimidation; 


b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; 


c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;


 x x x 




 Under paragraph 1(a), Article 266-A, the elements of rape are: (1)
 that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) that such 
act was accomplished through force, threat, or intimidation.
[21]
 Here, the prosecution had established beyond moral certainty these elements.


 AAA categorically asserted that accused-appellant inserted part of his penis into her vagina.
[22]

 Evidence further reveals that accused-appellant employed force to 
satisfy his lust as evinced by the following: AAA vividly recalled that 
accused-appellant dragged her towards the middle of the rice field
[23]
 and while she was on the ground, accused-appellant punched her on her face, head, neck, abdomen, and lower parts of her body.
[24]

 Her statements were corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. 
Quinton, who testified that AAA suffered multiple abrasions on her face 
and neck; contusions on her upper lip, nose and left cheek; and 
conjunctival hemorrhage in both eyes.
[25]






The identity of accused-appellant was proven beyond reasonable doubt
. 






AAA positively identified accused-appellant as her assailant; thus: 
  


Direct Examination by Fiscal Jesse S. Villegas:






Q


You know this person personally ?






 


 






A


Yes, sir. He is only known as Boyax. I do not know his complete name at that time.

x x x x 






 


 






Q


How were you able to recognize the identity of the person who raped you at that time because it was dark?






 


 






A


That time I was bringing with me my cell phone. 






 


 






Q


What is the connection of your having a
 cell phone to your testimony that you were able to recognize the 
identity of the person? 






 


 






A


Earlier we had a talk at the waiting 
shed and I was raising my cell phone on top of my head, and the light of
 that cell phone illuminated him, that is why I was able to recognize 
him.






 


 






Q


That was at the waiting shed?






 


 






A


Yes, sir.

Q:


Did you tell him who was that person who raped you?






 


 






A:


Yes, sir.






 


 






Q:


Who was that person that you told him who raped you?

Cross-Examination by Atty. Fermin D. Ondoy: 








Q:


You just presumed that the person you met at the waiting shed was the same person who grabbed you from behind? 






 


 






A:


No, sir, because I already saw him at the waiting shed and when the incident happened, I also saw him. 






 


 






Q:


 
At what point did you actually see him during the incident?






 


 






A:


After he covered by mouth, I turned my head towards him.






 


 






Q:


According to you, when that person grabbed you from behind, you could not move?






 


 






A:


Yes, sir, that was my answer earlier.






 


 






Q:


And when he grabbed you, your cell phone fell?






 


 






A:


It did not as I was still holding it. 






 


 






Q:


 
You mean to say, while at the rice field you still had your cell phone at that time? 






 


 






A:


When he pulled me towards the rice field I was no longer holding it.
[29]






 






x x x x 






 


 






Q:


When was the next time you saw him again?






 


 






A:


 
I saw him next at the hospital as he was brought and presented by the policemen.
[30]












The credibility of the private complainant as a witness.
 






Accused-appellant seeks to demolish AAA's testimony by claiming 
that her testimony is full of inconsistencies. He insists that AAA could
 not have turned her face towards him and see his face because she 
herself stated that the perpetrator tightly grabbed her from behind so 
that she could not move. Accused-appellant further contends that AAA 
mentioned in her sworn statement that the perpetrator allegedly made a 
push and pull movement. However, AAA failed to state this act during the
 direct examination. Thus, according to accused-appellant, AAA's 
statements are incredible. 


 The Court is not convinced. 
 There are no material 
inconsistencies in AAA's statements. While AAA may not have been able to
 move her entire body when accused-appellant dragged her to the rice 
field, it is not impossible for her to turn her head and see 
accused-appellant's face. As testified by AAA, she was able to see 
accused-appellant's face through the light from her cellphone when she 
turned her head while being dragged by accused-appellant to the rice 
field.
[31]
 Moreover, it
 is inconsequential that AAA did not mention during the direct 
examination that accused-appellant made push and pull movements. What is
 material is that AAA categotically testified that accused-appellant was
 able to forcibly insert part of his penis into her vagina.
 
Certainly, the claimed inconsistencies in AAA's testimony are not of a 
nature that would impair AAA's credibility as a witness. They do not 
touch upon the elements of the crime of Rape. They are minor details 
which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime and cannot be 
considered grounds for accused-appellant's acquittal. 
 Besides, inaccuracies and inconsistencies are expected in a rape victim's testimony.
[32]
 Rape is a painful experience which is oftentimes not remembered in detail.
[33]

 Such an offense is not analogous to a person's achievement or 
accomplishment as to be worth recalling or reliving; rather, it is 
something which causes deep psychological wounds and casts a stigma upon
 the victim, scarring her psyche for life and which her conscious and 
subconscious mind would opt to forget. Thus, a rape victim cannot be 
expected to mechanically keep and then give an accurate account of the 
traumatic and horrifying experience she had undergone.
[34]

 The RTC, as affirmed by the CA, found AAA's testimony credible. The 
Court finds no reason to rule otherwise considering that AAA's narration
 is clear, spontaneous, and straightforward. 
 Furthermore, 
testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, for when a
 woman or a girl-child says that she has been raped, she says in effect 
all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed.
[35]
 Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.
[36]

 No young woman would admit that she was raped, make public the offense 
and allow the examination of het private parts, undergo the troubles and
 humiliation of a public trial and endure the ordeal of testifying to 
all the gory details, if she had not in fact been raped.
[37]






Accused-appellant's assertion of unlawful arrest.
 






Accused-appellant argues that his warrantless arrest when he was brought to the hospital by the police officers is illegal.
  
 The Court is not persuaded. 
 Records show that the police officers merely invited accused-Â­appellant to go with them and that he voluntarily agreed.
[38]

 This was corroborated by accused-appellant's wife, who testified that 
accused-appellant freely went with the police officers to the police 
station.
[39]
 
 Also, even 
in gratia argumenti 
that the arrest was illegal, the objection to the illegality of the arrest has already been waived. In 
Lapi v. People
[40]
 the Court said:
  


 The Court has consistently ruled that any objection involving a 
warrant of arrest or the procedure for the acquisition by the court of 
jurisdiction over the person of the accused must be made before he 
enters his plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived. We have also
 ruled that an accused may be estopped from assailing the illegality of 
his arrest if he fails to move for the quashing of the information 
against him before his arraignment. And since the legality of an arrest 
affects only the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the 
accused, any defect in the arrest of the accused may be deemed cured 
when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the trial court. We 
have also held in a number of cases that the illegal arrest of an 
accused is not a sufficient cause for setting aside a valid judgment 
rendered upon a sufficient complaint after a trial free from error; such
 arrest does not negate the validity of the conviction of the accused.
[41]




 In the case at bench, accused-appellant went into arraignment, 
pleaded not guilty, and actively participated in the trial. He only 
raised the issue of the validity of his arrest before the CA. He never 
questioned the legality of his arrest before the arraignment. He is, 
therefore, deemed to have waived any alleged irregularity in his arrest 
when he submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court through his 
counsel-assisted plea during his arraignment. 
 
Penalty and damages
. 
 The RTC and the CA correctly imposed the penalty of
 reclusion perpetua
 in accordance with paragraph 	1 (a), Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended. 
 However, to conform with jurisprudence, the Court increases the amount of civil indemnity to P75,000.00.
[42]
 The Court further awards to AAA moral damages in the amount of P75,000.00, and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00.
[43]
