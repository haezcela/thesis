[2]
 dated June 14, 2019 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated September 24, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 42179. The assailed CA Decision affirmed with modification the Decision

CONTRARY TO LAW.
[10]
2) 
Criminal Case No. L-10873 (Attempted Murder)
That on or about 10:30 in the morning of February 20, 2016 in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, with intent to kill, and abuse of superior strength, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, after committing sexual abuse upon [AAA] (offended party), a 13 year old minor (DOB 23 Feb. 2002) and in order to conceal his crime of sexual abuse, lifted and threw the said minor-complainant into a ravine, which cause her injuries to wit: multiple abrasions, upper and lower extremities, accused however was not able to [perform] all the acts of execution which could produce the crime of Murder as a consequence thereof as the injuries sustain[ed] by the minor-complainant [were] not fatal, to the prejudice and damage of the minor complainant.
Contrary to Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code.
[11]
Upon arraignment on March 8, 2016, petitioner pleaded "not guilty" to both charges.
[12]
 Pre-trial and trial ensued.
The RTC synthesized the evidence of the parties as follows:
Evidence for the Prosecution
On the date [of] the incident, February 20, 2016, AAA was 13 years old, having been born on February 23, 2002.
On February 20, 2016 at 10:30 a.m., while AAA was on her way to buy their food and chicken feed per order of her father, she saw [petitioner] from the opposite direction around 15 to 18 meters away from her. At the place where there were no houses, [petitioner] blocked her way, then pulled her to a forested ("
masukal
") area, and started touching her breast in a circular motion while he was pulling her. She pleaded for him to stop and also tried to resist or pull herself away from him. At that time, [petitioner] also inserted his hand inside her panty and touched her private part. She could not move at that time because she was already afraid. He embraced her while pulling her towards the forested area for around 35 minutes. The [petitioner] also told her not to be noisy. After pulling each other for some time, [petitioner] suddenly carried her and threw her into the ravine which was around 25 meters high from where they were. She then rolled down and hit her head on the ground. She also looked for her other slipper which fell one meter lower from where she fell. Her further rolling down the ravine was prevented by the vines that wrapped around her body. When she finally stood up, she removed the vines from her body, looked for her slipper, and run [
sic
]. Then, [she] saw a man at the top part of the mountain from where she and [petitioner] were before she was thrown by the latter, and she asked for that man's help. Then, the man came down, got her out of the ravine and brought her to a place where there were already some houses. She learned that the man who helped her was Alvin Santos. At that time, she had many bruises and her body was very painful. She relayed to the people there what happened to her. Subsequently, her father, mother, and elder sister arrived. Then, they proceeded to the police to report. Afterwards, she was brought to the house of the [petitioner] where the [petitioner] and his wife were. When she identified the [petitioner], the police arrested him. Then she was brought to 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 for medical examination. Because of the incident, she felt very afraid and though[t] that she was going to die.
Alvin Santos testified that while he was walking along the road on February 20, 2016 at 10:30 a.m. in order to get some cogon grass, he saw AAA, a daughter of his relative, being pulled by [petitioner]. Then, he saw the [petitioner] carry AAA and throw her into the cliff. He was around 10 meters away from them. After the [petitioner] threw AAA to the cliff, he asked the [petitioner] why he threw AAA into the ravine, but the [petitioner] only looked at him and ran away. AAA, on the other hand, was already on the ground asking for help ("
saklolo
"). When he heard that, he went down and brought AAA up to the road. AAA sustained several injuries on her face, legs, and head. Then, he brought her to his niece's house where AAA was made to drink water. He also proceeded to AAA's house and informed her father about the incident. After informing AAA's father, AAA was brought to a doctor. In the afternoon of that same day, he again saw [petitioner] at the house of the latter's parents-in-law. He informed the police and the barangay captain that the [petitioner] did something to AAA, so the [petitioner] was arrested.
Dr. Joy Cristobal-Gonzalo testified that she examined AAA on February 20, 2016, the date of 1he incident, at 4 p.m. She found on AAA's hymen old laceration at 1, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions which she opined were sustained around more than six months before the date of the incident.
As for PO3 Quezada, she only read aloud certain entries in the police blotter which the defense stipulated upon.
Thereafter, the prosecution rested its case with the admission of its following documentary evidence:
x x x x
Evidence of the Defense
[Petitioner] denied having committed the crimes charged against him because he was inside his house taking care of his child.
He testified that he is a native of Zamboanga City, while his live-in partner is from 
xxxxxxxxxxx
. On February 20, 2016, they had already been staying for three weeks with the parents of his live-in partner in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
. They were just on vacation, so he did not work as a construction worker during that time. For said three weeks, he did not go out of the house as he only took care of his one-year-old child.
He first saw AAA in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 when AAA went to the house of his live-in partner and asked him if there was a man who ran towards his house. On cross-examination, however, he changed his answer and testified that he was asked by a man first. The next time, it was AAA who already talked to his live-in partner. He denied that he [knew] Alvin Santos before the date of the incident.
The defense rested its case when it failed to present its second witness who could no longer be located.
[13]
The Ruling of the RTC
In its Decision
[14]
 dated July 4, 2018, the RTC convicted petitioner of violation of Section 5(b),
[15]
 Article III of RA 7610 and of Attempted Murder under Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the RPC. It ruled that the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of petitioner beyond reasonable doubt.
Likewise, the RTC found AAA and her testimony to have stood the test of credibility. It declared that AAA was consistent and natural, and had positively identified petitioner as the perpetrator. It was also convinced that there was no tinge of fabrication or concoction of the incident on the part of AAA, noting that she was unwavering even during her cross-examination.
[16]
As to the case for violation of Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, the RTC held that petitioner's acts of touching AAA's breasts and inserting his finger inside her panties constituted lascivious conduct. It ruled that when petitioner approached AAA and intercepted her along the way and suddenly performed the aforesaid acts, it was clear that he had the intention to touch her private parts.
[17]
As regards the case for Attempted Murder, the RTC ruled that petitioner's intent to kill was flagrant when he carried AAA and then threw her into the ravine of around 25 to 30 meters below the road. Further, the RTC found petitioner to have employed abuse of superior strength in executing the intended felony. It noted thatAAA was only 13 years old at the time of the incident; hence, her strength could net overcome that of petitioner who is a male and who claimed that he was a construction worker.
[18]
The RTC further held that petitioner's defense of denial did not deserve credence. It declared that denial is an intrinsically weak defense and should be supported by strong evidence to merit credibility.
[19]
Thus, with respect to the case for violation of Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, the RTC sentenced petitioner to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 medium, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
 maximum, as maximum. Moreover, it ordered the payment of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages, both with interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid. It further ordered the payment of a fine of P15,000.00 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of nonÂ­payment.
[20]
As to the case for Attempted Murder, the RTC imposed the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as maximum. Further, it ordered the payment of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid.
[21]
Petitioner appealed to the CA.
The Ruling of the CA
In the assailed Decision
[22]
 dated June 14, 2019, the CA affirmed the RTC's factual findings and accordingly found proper the conviction of petitioner for the two charges. However, it made modifications as to the penalties imposed.
Citing 
People v. Caoili
,
[23]
 the CA held that when the victim at the time of the commission of the offense is aged 12 years or over but under 18 years, or is 18 or older but unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the nomenclature of the offense should be Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610.
The CA ruled that the correct penalty for Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 is the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 medium, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of 
reclusion temporal
 medium, as maximum.
The CA modified the damages awarded by the RTC with respect to the case for Lascivious Conduct. Aside from the fine of P15,000.00 and moral damages of P50,000.00 already imposed by the RTC, the CA ordered petitioner to pay P50,000.00 as civil indenmity and increased the amount of exemplary damages to P50,000.00. The CA also ordered the payment of interest on the damages awarded at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from the date of finality of the judgment until full payment.
On the penalty for Attempted Murder, the CA also modified the RTC's imposition, ruling that petitioner should be imposed the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as maximum.
With respect to the award of damages in the case for Attempted Murder, the CA ruled that the amounts imposed by the RTC, to wit: P50,000.00 as civil indenmity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, with interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from the date of finality of the judgment until fully paid, are all consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.
In the assailed Resolution
[24]
 dated September 24, 2019, the CA denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration
[25]
 for lack of merit.
Thus, the instant petition.
Issue
Whether the CA erred in affirming petitioner's conviction for (1) Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 and (2) Attempted Murder under Article 248, in relation to Article 6 of the RPC.
The Court's Ruling
The petition lacks merit.
At the outset, the Court affirms the CA in declaring that the proper nomenclature of the offense charged against petitioner for violation of Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 should be Lascivious Conduct. This is in light of the fact that AAA was only 13 years old at the time of the incident.
In 
People v. Tulagan
[26]
 (
Tulagan
), the Court pronounced that if the victim is 12 years old or above but under 18 years old, or at least 18 years old under special circumstances, "
the nomenclature of the crime should be 'Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610' with the imposable penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
, but it should not make any reference to the RPC
."
Lascivious Conduct is defined in the rules and regulations of RA 7610, known as the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases, as follows:
Section 2. 
Definition of Terms
. - As used in these Rules, unless the context requires otherwise -
x x x x
 
(h) 
"Lascivious conduct" means the 
intentional touching
, either directly or through clothing, of the 
genitalia
, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or 
the introduction of any object into the genitalia
, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an 
intent to abuse
, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or 
gratify the sexual desire of any person
, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person[.] (Italics supplied)
Lascivious Conduct is penalized under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610:
SECTION 5. 
Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse
. - Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.
The penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
 shall be imposed upon the following:
x x x x 
 
(b)
 Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; 
Provided
, That when the victims is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: 
Provided
, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period; and
x x x x
The essential elements of Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 are:
1. The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or 
lascivious conduct
.
2. The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.
3. The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.
[27]
Under Section 3(a) of RA 7610, the term "children" refers to persons below 18 years of age, or those over but unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. In this case, it is undisputed that AAA was only 13 years old at the time of the incident. This was alleged in the Information and evidenced by her Certificate of Live Birth.
[28]
Petitioner, however, contends that the prosecution failed to establish the presence of the second element, 
i.e.
, that the lascivious act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse. He argues that the prosecution neither alleged nor proved that AAA was exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse besides the alleged incident.
Petitioner is mistaken.
As held in 
Olivarez v. Court of Appeals
,
[29]
 the phrase "other sexual abuse" covers not only a child who is abused for profit, but also one who engages in lascivious conduct through the coercion or intimidation by an adult.
[30]
 The very definition of "child abuse" under Section 3(b)
[31]
 of RA 7610 does not require that the victim suffer a separate and distinct act of sexual abuse aside from the act complained of; it refers to the maltreatment whether habitual or not, of the child.
[32]
 Thus, contrary to petitioner's argument, there can be a violation of Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 even though the sexual abuse against the child victim was committed only once, even without a prior sexual offense.
[33]
Further, in the offense of Lascivious Conduct, there must be some form of compulsion equivalent to intimidation which subdues the free exercise of the offended party's will.
[34]
 The intimidation, however, need not necessarily be irresistible.
[35]
In this case, coercion or intimidation was present when petitioner, at the place where there were no houses, blocked AAA's way and then pulled her to a forested area, where he then succeeded in performing his lascivious acts with her. AAA pleaded for petitioner to stop and also tried to resist and pull herself away from him. AAA could not move when petitioner inserted his hand inside her panties and touched her private part as she was already afraid. Moreover, petitioner told AAA not to be noisy.
[36]
 Evidently, the second element of the offense is present in this case.
Considering the presence of all the elements of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly convicted petitioner for the offense charged.
With respect to the charge for Attempted Murder, the Court affirms the RTC and the CA in holding that petitioner's intent to kill AAA was proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, their finding that the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength attended petitioner's attempt to kill AAA should be reversed.
Both the RTC and the CA found petitioner guilty of Attempted Murder. The crime of Murder is defined and punished by Article 248 of the RPC, as amended by RA 7659, to wit:
Article 248. 
Murder
. - Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
, to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
1. With treachery, 
taking advantage of superior strength
, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity; x x x x (Italics supplied.)
To successfully prosecute Murder, the following elements must be established: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.
[37]
A felony in the attempted stage is explained in the paragraph 3, Article 6 of the RPC as follows: 
ART. 6 
Consummated, frustrated, and attempted felonies
. Â­ x x x x
There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.
The essential elements of an attempted felony are: (1) the offender commences the commission of the felony directly by overt acts; (2) he does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony; (3) the offender's act be not stopped by his own spontaneous desistance; and (4) the non-performance of all acts of execution was due to cause or accident other than his or her spontaneous desistance.
[38]
With regard to Murder in its attempted or frustrated stage, the Court, in 
Yap v. People
,
[39]
 explained:
With respect to attempted or frustrated murder, the principal and essential element thereof is the intent on the part of the assailant to take the life of the person attacked. Such intent must be proved in a clear and evident manner to exclude every possible doubt as to the homicidal intent of the aggressor. Intent to kill is a specific intent that the State must allege in the information, and then prove by either direct or circumstantial evidence, as differentiated from a general criminal intent, which is presumed from the commission of a felony by 
dolo
. Intent to kill, being a state of mind, is discerned by the courts only through external manifestations, 
i.e.
, the acts and conduct of the accused at the time of the assault and immediately thereafter. The following factors are considered to determine the presence of intent to kill, namely: (1) the means used by the malefactors; (2) the nature, location, and number of wounds sustained by the victim; (3) the conduct of the malefactors before, during, or immediately after the killing of the victim; and (4) the circumstances under which the crime was committed and the motives of the accused.
[40]
Petitioner's intent to kill AAA was evident in his acts of carrying AAA and throwing her into the ravine of about 25 to 30 meters below the road after performing his lascivious conduct with AAA.
[41]
 Apparently, petitioner did so in an attempt to conceal the sexual abuse he committed against AAA. When asked to estimate the depth of her fall into the ravine, AAA testified that it was comparable to falling from the third floor of a building.
[42]
 Remarkably, the killing of AAA would have been consummated if not for the vines that wrapped around her body which prevented her from further rolling down the ravine.
[43]
However, the Court disagrees with the RTC and the CA that abuse of superior strength attended petitioner's attempt to kill AAA. In this case, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, ruled that AAA's young age of 13 years is an obvious indication that her strength could not overcome that of petitioner "who is a male and who claimed to work at a construction."
[44]
"
The circumstance of abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor, and the latter takes advantage of it in the commission of the crime.
"
[45]
 The appreciation of abuse of superior strength depends on the age, size, and strength of the parties.
[46]
It is beyond doubt that petitioner was superior to AAA in terms of age, size, and strength. Nonetheless, the records fail to show that petitioner purposely selected or took advantage of such inequality to facilitate the commission of the crime. As held in 
People v. Evasco
,
[47]
 the assailant "must be shown to have consciously sought the advantage or to have the deliberate intent to use [his] superior advantage." Thus, to take advantage of superior strength means to purposely use force 
excessively out of proportion
 to the means of defense available to the person attacked.
[48]
In his attempt to kill AAA after performing his lascivious acts, petitioner did not purposely use and take advantage of his superior strength. After petitioner and AAA pulled each other for about 35 minutes, petitioner merely carried AAA and threw her into the deep ravine.
[49]
 There is no showing that he used force excessively out of proportion before throwing her into the ravine. Observably, while the Information alleges that AAA sustained multiple abrasions in the upper and lower extremities, the examination conducted by Dr. Joy CristobalÂ­-Gonzalo was only on the hymen of AAA. Likewise, no evidence was offered by the prosecution to prove the physical injuries allegedly sustained by AAA. Thus, the Court finds erroneous the appreciation by the RTC and the CA of the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.
Consequently, the absence of any of the circumstances enumerated in Article 248 necessitates the Court to hold petitioner liable only for Attempted Homicide under Article 249 in relation to Article 6 of the RPC, as follows:
Article 249. 
Homicide
. - Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246,
[50]
 shall kill another without the attendance of any of the circumstances enumerated in the next preceding article, shall be deemed guilty of homicide and be punished by 
reclusion temporal
.
In an attempt to assail the credibility of AAA's testimony, petitioner claims inconsistency in AAA's statements. He points out that AAA testified during direct examination that he pulled her to the forested area
[51]
 but stated during cross-examination that he was not able to pull her.
[52]
 Additionally, he avers that AAA's actuation after the alleged incident lies outside human experience and fails to inspire belief. He particularly mentions AAA's testimony that right after rolling to the ground, she took her slipper and tried to look for the other one. He opines that "
a person who has just been sexually abused would not bother to look for her belongings. Instead, he/she would exert effort to escape as soon as possible
."
[53]
The Court is not swayed.
The alleged inconsistency in AAA's testimony appears minor and inconsequential. It does not hinge on any essential element of Lascivious Conduct or Attempted Homicide. Besides, leeway is generally given to minor witnesses when relating traumatic incidents of the past.
[54]
 Jurisprudence dictates:
x x x When the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.
[55]
Moreover, it bears emphasizing that "[
t
]
he credibility of the witnesses is best addressed by the trial court, it being in a better position to decide such question, having heard them and observed their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grueling examination
."
[56]
 Considering the absence of any showing that the RTC's assessment on the credibility of the AAA's testimony was tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of a fact, it is entitled to great weight, if not conclusive or binding on the Court.
[57]
Lastly, petitioner's bare assertion of denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony of AAA. Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law.
[58]
 Likewise, alibi is one of the weakest defenses; it is not only inherently frail and unreliable but also easy to fabricate and difficult to check or rebut.
[59]
As regards the penalties imposed, the Court finds a need to make modifications.
With respect to the offense of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, the CA imposed the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 medium, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of 
reclusion temporal
 medium, as maximum.
The penalty to be imposed for the offense of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
. The Indeterminate Sentence Law is applicable because 
reclusion perpetua
 is merely used as the maximum period consisting of a range starting from 
reclusion temporal
 medium, a divisible penalty.
[60]
 Since none of the circumstances under Section 31
[61]
 of RA 7610 is present, and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree which is 
prision mayor
 medium to 
reclusion temporal
 minimum, and the maximum term to be taken from 
reclusion temporal
 maximum, there being no other modifying circumstances attending the commission of the offense.
[62]
Thus, the Court finds that the proper penalty for the offense of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 should be the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 medium, as the minimum term, to twenty (20) years of 
reclusion temporal
 maximum, as the maximum term.
With respect to the crime of Attempted Homicide, Article 249 of the RPC provides the penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 for Homicide in ts consummated stage. Article 51 of the RPC states that the penalty for an attempted felony is two (2) degrees lower than that prescribed for the consummated felony. The penalty that is two (2) degrees lower than 
reclusion temporal
 is 
prision correccional
, which has a duration of six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.
Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence shall be taken in view of the attending circumstances that could be properly imposed under the rules of the RPC, and the minimum term shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the RPC. Thus, the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence shall be taken within the range of 
prision correccional
, depending on the modifying circumstances. In turn, the minimum term of the indeterminate penalty to be imposed shall be taken from the penalty one degree lower of 
prision correccional
, that is, 
arresto mayor
 with a duration of one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months.
In view of the absence of any modifying circumstance, the maximum term of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the medium period of 
prision correccional
 or two (2) years and four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months; and the minimum term shall be taken within the range of 
arresto mayor
. Hence, the penalty for the crime of Attempted Homicide is the indeterminate penalty of six (6) months of 
arresto mayor
, as the minimum term, to four (4) years and two (2) months of
 prision correccional
, as the maximum term.
The Court also finds a need to modify the monetary awards.
As to the amount of damages for the offense of Lascivious Conduct, the Court affirms the CA in upholding the moral damages of P50,000.00 already imposed by the RTC, in increasing the exemplary damages to P50,000.00, and in imposing the additional amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity. These amounts are in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.
[63]
 However, for lack of legal basis, the imposed fine of P15,000.00 should be deleted.
As regards the damages for the crime of Attempted Homicide, the case of 
People v. Jugueta
[64]
 instructs that the accused shall be liable only for P20,000.00 as civil indemnity and P20,000.00 as moral damages. Further, no exemplary damages shall be awarded in view of the absence of any aggravating circumstance.
[65]
Lastly, in consonance with prevailing jurisprudence, all the monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of six percent 6% 
per annum
 from the date of finality of the judgment until fully paid.
