R E S O L U T I O N




INTING, J.:


The Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolutions dated June 23, 2014
[2]
 and October 22, 2015
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R SP No.134435.
 
 
The Antecedents
 
 On October 14, 1996, Spouses Agerico and Carmelita Abrogar (petitioners) obtained a loan amounting to P11,250,000.00 from respondent Land Bank of the Philippines (Land Bank). The loan was secured by a real estate and chattel mortgage
[4]
 executed by petitioners in Land Bank's favor.
[5]
 Petitioners, however, eventually defaulted in the payment of their loan. This prompted Land Bank to commence extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings on the mortgaged properties.
[6]
 To stop the foreclosure proceedings, petitioners filed a Complaint
[7]
 against Land Bank before Branch 51, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Puerto Princesa City for specific performance and damages with application for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order. Petitioners prayed, among others, that the RTC order Land Bank to allow them to settle their obligation pursuant to the Letter
[8]
 dated October 5, 1998 which contained the bank's proposed terms and conditions for the restructuring of their loan.
[9]
 
 
Ruling of the RTC
 
 In its Decision
[10]
 dated April 1, 2011, the RTC dismissed the Complaint for lack of a cause of action.
[11]
 It explained that:
 
 [Petitioners'] lawful obligation is to settle its delinquent account with [Land Bank] in order that the latter may perform its mandate of extending financial assistance to those who are qualified.
 x x x [Petitioners] ought to bear in mind that restructuring their loan is not part of their original contract. It is merely a privilege accorded to them by [Land Bank]. They cannot invoke that as a demandable right When [Land Bank] refused to adopt their own interpretation, they should have taken that as being equivalent to a denial of their request for restructuring. x x x
[12]
 
 The RTC likewise denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration
[13]
 in its Order
[14]
 dated November 25, 2013. Petitioners thereafter elevated the case 
via
 a Petition for 
Certiorari
[15]
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA.
 
 
Ruling of the CA
 
 In its Resolution
[16]
 dated June 23, 2014, the CA dismissed the Petition for 
Certiorari
 for: (a) being the wrong mode of appeal;
[17]
 and (b) lack of an affidavit of service, pursuant to Section 13, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.
[18]
 The CA stressed that the proper recourse for petitioners was to file an ordinary appeal under Section 2(a), Rule 41 and 
not
 to resort to the extraordinary remedy of 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.
[19]
 Moreover, the CA noted that even if the Petition for 
Certiorari
 was treated as an ordinary appeal, it would still be dismissed for having been filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period provided under Rule 41.
[20]
 Petitioners moved for reconsideration,
[21]
 but the CA denied the motion in its Resolution
[22]
 dated October 22, 2015. Consequently, petitioners filed the present Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[23]
 before the Court assailing the CA Resolutions.
 
 
The Issue
 
 The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether the CA correctly dismissed the Petition for 
Certiorari
 outright for being the wrong mode of appeal.
 
 
The Court's Ruling
 
 The petition is without merit.
 It is settled that a special civil action for 
certiorari
 may only be resorted to in cases where there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[24]
 "The extraordinary remedy of
 certiorari
 is not a substitute for a lost appeal; it is not allowed when a party to a case fails to appeal a judgment to the proper forum, especially if one's own negligence or error in one's choice of remedy occasioned such loss or lapse."
[25]
 As the remedies of appeal and 
certiorari
 are 
mutually exclusive, certiorari 
will 
not
 prosper if appeal is an available remedy to a litigant, even if the ground is grave abuse of discretion.
[26]
 In this case, the proper recourse for petitioners was to appeal the Decision dated April 1, 2011, which was rendered by the RTC in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, under Section 2(a)
[27]
 of Rule 41 and 
not 
to resort to 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Since the remedy of an ordinary appeal was undeniably available to petitioners, the CA correctly dismissed their Petition for 
Certiorari
 for being the wrong mode of appeal.
 In an attempt to justify their plea for the liberal application of the Rules, petitioners insist that they should not be bound by their former counsel's negligence in choosing to file the wrong remedy because it would deprive them of their property without due process of law.
[28]
 This argument, however, is untenable. After all, "the negligence of the counsel binds the client, even mistakes in the application of procedural rules."
[29]
 The only exception to this doctrine is ''when the reckless or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client of due process of law."
[30]
 In such a case, the counsel's error must be so 
palpable 
and 
maliciously exercised
 that it would viably be the basis for disciplinary action.
[31]
 Thus, "for the exception to apply, the client must prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was maliciously deprived of information that he could not have acted to protect his interests."
[32]
 Here, petitioners clearly failed to allege and prove that their former counsel was motivated by malice in choosing to file a
 certiorari 
petition instead of an ordinary appeal before the CA. For clarity and precision, the pertinent portion of their petition is quoted below:
 
 The petitioners herein appear to be deprived of the benefits of the [P6,000,000.00] appraisal of their property by [Land Bank], arising from the gross negligence of their former counsel on record. The error of the former counsel on record in choosing [to file a] petition for [
certiorari
] under [R]ule 65 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, rather than ordinary appeal, must be considered gross negligence on the part of the counsel, and such gross negligence will cause the petitioners deprivation of property without due process of law. x x x
[33]
 
 Petitioners' mere allegation of gross negligence, 
without
 any showing of malicious intent on the part of their former counsel, does not suffice for the exception to apply.
[34]
 To be sure, "malice is never presumed but must be proved as a fact."
[35]
 This, petitioners evidently failed to do.
 Based on these considerations, the Court finds no basis to relax the rules of procedure in this case. The Court notes that the RTC Decision dated April 1, 2011 has long attained finality, given petitioners' failure to interpose an appeal within the reglementary period provided under the Rules. Consequently, the Court can no longer exercise its appellate jurisdiction to review this Decision, even 
if 
it is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law.
