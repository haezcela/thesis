LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case
This petition for review
[1]
 assails the following dispositions of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 1123 (CTA Case No. 8140) entitled "
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bases Conversion and Development Authority
:"
Decision
[2]
 dated December 16, 2014 granting the claim for tax refund of respondent Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA); and,
Resolution
[3]
 dated April 15, 2015, denying the motion for reconsideration of petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR).
Antecedents
Respondent BCDA was the owner of four (4) real properties in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City which had a total area of 12,036 sq. m.. The lots were collectively referred to as the "Expanded Big Delta Lots." It entered into a contract to sell with the "Net Group," an unincorporated joint venture composed of four (4) corporations: (1) 18-14 Property Holdings, Incorporated; (2) 14-8b Property Holdings, Inc.; (3) The Net Group Project Management Corporation; and (4) The Net Group Property Management Corporation. The total purchase price was Php2,032,749,327.96. The "Net Group" committed 
not
 to remit to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) the total amount of Php101,637,466.40 as Creditable Tax Withheld at source (CWT) to give time to respondent to present a certification of tax exemption on or before June 9, 2008.
On May 28, 2008, respondent sought from petitioner the aforesaid certification but the CIR did not respond.
On July 31 2008, respondent and the "Net Group" executed the corresponding Deeds of Absolute Sale. In view of respondent's failure to present a certification of tax exemption, the "Net Group" deducted the amount of Php101,637,466.40 as CWT and issued to respondent the corresponding certificates of creditable tax withheld at source.
[4]
 The "Net Group" remitted the amount to the BIR Regional District Office No. 44.
On March 9, 2009, respondent wrote the BIR for refund of the amount but, again, petitioner did not respond.
On July 29, 2010, respondent sought affirmative relief from the CTA, specifically for refund of the amount in question. Respondent claimed that it was exempt from all taxes and fees arising from or in relation to the sale, as provided under its charter, Republic Act (RA) 7227, as amended by RA 7917.
In its answer, petitioner countered that respondent failed to support its claim for tax refund. In particular, respondent allegedly failed to show, by competent evidence, that the CWT was erroneously or illegally withheld. Respondent's claim for tax refund purportedly did not comply with the procedural requirements. Besides, all taxes paid to the BIR are presumed lawful and proper.
Ruling of the CTA First Division
In its Decision dated September 13, 2013, the CTA First Division ruled in respondent's favor, 
viz
.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition for Review is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue is ORDERED to REFUND in favor of petitioner BASES CONVERSION DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY the amount of P101,637,466.40, representing creditable withholding tax paid on July 31, 2008 in connection with the sale/disposition of the 12,036 square-meter property, otherwise known as the "Expanded Big Delta Lots", located in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City.
SO ORDERED.
[5]
Petitioner's subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied under Resolution dated January 30, 2014.
On the CIR's petition for review,
[6]
 the CTA En Banc affirmed under Decision dated December 16, 2014. It also denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration under Resolution dated April 15, 2015.
The CTA En Banc ruled that while respondent is, indeed, not among the exempt corporations listed under Section 27 (C) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code
[7]
 (NIRC) or RA 8424, as amended by RA 9337 and RA 10026, nevertheless, insofar as the sale of the "Expanded Big Delta Lots" is concerned, RA 7227, as amended by RA 7917 specifically exempts respondent from taxes. While the NIRC and its amending statutes were only promulgated after respondent was established, RA 7227, as amended is a special law. The NIRC, being a general law, is not deemed to have amended or superseded the special law in the absence of an express repeal thereof in the NIRC itself.
Additionally, Section 32(B) (7) (b) of the NIRC excludes from gross income and exempts from income tax, "the income derived from any public utility or from the exercise of any essential governmental functions accruing to the Government of the Philippines or to any political subdivisions." Section 2.57.5 of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 likewise provides that "withholding of CWT should not apply to income payments made to national Government and its instrumentalities."
The CTA further ruled that the sale proceeds of the subject properties are excluded from respondent's gross income pursuant Section 32 of the NIRC. Also, Section 2.57.5 of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98,
[8]
 the creditable withholding tax system does not apply to the National Government and its instrumentalities.
Finally, the CTA En Banc upheld the tax-exempt provision in respondent's Charter. It ordained:
xxx   xxx   xxx
xxx petitioner's reliance in the cases of Philam Asset Management, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, United International Pictures AB v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Asiaworld Properties Phil. Corp v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, is misplaced. It is noteworthy that the petitioner-taxpayers in these cases do not have a tax-exempt provision on its transaction that is akin to respondent's charter.
[9]
The Present Petition
Petitioner now urges this Court to nullify the CTA En Banc's Decision dated December 16, 2014 and Resolution dated April 15, 2015. Petitioner reiterates that respondent is not exempt from CWT. But even assuming it is, respondent's failure to comply with the requirements for tax refund negates its entitlement to such refund. Petitioner argues, in the main:
1. RA 7227, as amended by RA 7917 was 
supplanted
 by the NIRC specifically its Section 27(c). The NIRC got enacted in 1997 and took effect on January 1, 1998. In case of conflict, a later law prevails over an earlier law.
2. In claiming for tax refund, respondent did not comply with Section 10 of Revenue Regulation No. 6-85
[10]
 requiring that the income which was supposedly taxed must be shown to have been included in the gross income. It must also be proved that the tax was in fact withheld at source.
Petitioner cites 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Far East Bank and Trust Company
[11]
 where the claim for refund was denied for failure of therein respondent to present the Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at source.
Additionally, petitioner asserts that respondent's Annual Income Tax Return, copies of the Deeds of Absolute Sale, BIR payment Forms 0605, BIR Tax Payment Deposit Slips, and Certificates of Creditable Withholding Tax do not sufficiently establish that the income from the sale of the subject properties is part of the gross income.
3. Respondent failed to indicate in its income tax return whether it was availing of a tax credit or a tax refund. Since respondent 
carried over the 2008 excess credit, then this "carry over" should also apply to the CWT that was withheld from the sale of the properties. When "carry over" is availed of, the option for refund is no longer available.
In its Comment, respondent ripostes: Section 8 of RA 7227 as amended by RA 7917 provides that the proceeds from [respondent's] sale of government lands and other properties are exempt from all forms of taxes and fees. Further, Administrative Order (AO) 236 has declared that (a) the proceeds from the sale of government lands and other properties pursuant to RA 7227, as amended, are government funds and shall be remitted to the National Treasury and shall accrue to the General Fund of the Government and (b) the funds are automatically appropriated for the budget requirement of the several beneficiary-agencies identified under RA 7917.
Respondent further calls attention to paragraph (d), Section 8 of RA 7227, as amended by RA 7917.
[12]
 The provision commands that respondent's Global City properties shall be sold and the sale proceeds shall not be diminished. Respondent asserts that this provisions signifies that such sales are not subject to any taxes or fees.
Respondent avers that RA 7227, as amended, a special law, was not deemed superseded by the NIRC, a general law. On this score, respondent cites 
Lichauco & Company, Inc. v. Apostol
,
[13]
 
Fajardo v. Villafuerte
,
[14]
 
De Villa v. Court of Appeals
,
[15]
 and 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Tax Appeals
.
[16]
Too, respondent posits that the income from the sale of the Expanded Big Delta Lots was not included in its 2008 Income Tax Return precisely because the sale was excluded from its gross income per Section 8 of RA 7227, as amended. The sale proceeds are in the nature of a special appropriation because their disposition has already been determined by RA 7227, as amended. Thus, the use of the disposition proceeds for purposes other than that for which they were specifically intended violates not only RA 7227 but also the Constitution.
Core Issue
Is the BCDA exempt from Creditable Withholding Tax (CWT) on the sale of its Global City properties?
Ruling
The affirmative answer is found in Section 8 of RA 7227, as amended by RA 7917, otherwise known as the Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992, 
viz
.:
SECTION 8. Funding Scheme. - The capital of the Conversion Authority shall come from the sales proceeds and/or transfers of certain Metro Manila military camps, including all lands covered by Proclamation No. 423, series of 1957, commonly known as Fort Bonifacio and Villamor (Nicholas) Air Base, namely:
Camp
 
 Area in has.

However, six (6) months after approval of this Act, the President shall authorize the Conversion Authority to dispose of certain areas in Fort Bonifacio and Villamor as the latter so determines. The Conversion Authority shall provide the President a report on any such disposition or plan for disposition within one (1) month from such disposition or preparation of such plan.

(4) Three percent (3%) - To finance the National Health Insurance Program;
(5) Five percent (5%) - To finance critical infrastructure projects not covered by the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) program in areas surrounding the former base lands;

The provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, 
the proceeds of the sale thereof shall not be diminished and, tlterefore, exempt from all forms oftaxes and fees
.
 (Emphasis supplied)
Section 8 is two (2) pronged. The first commands that the sale proceeds of certain properties in Fort Bonifacio and Villamor (Nicholas) Air Base are 
deemed appropriated by Congress
 to each of the aforenamed recipients and for the respective purposes specified therein. Consequently, the sale proceeds are not BCDA income but 
public funds subject to the distribution scheme and purposes provided in the law itself
. Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 32 of the Administrative Code of 1987 directs that "[a]ll monies appropriated for functions, activities, projects and programs shall be available solely for the specific purposes for which these are appropriated." The second expressly enjoins that the 
proceeds of the sale shall not be diminished
 by any item or circumstance, including 
all forms of taxes and fees
, to wit:
The provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the proceeds of the sale thereof shall not be diminished and, therefore, exempt from all forms of taxes and fees
The provision is self-explanatory.
The Court has invariably ruled that when the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no occasion for interpretation; there is only room for application.
[17]
 In 
Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels, Inc., v. Bureau of Internal Revenue
,
[18]
 the Court clarified that petitioner remained exempt from payment of corporate income tax on its gaming revenues since the PAGCOR Charter or Presidential Decree No. 1869
[19]
 explicitly provides tax exemption for persons or entities contracting with PAGCOR relative to casino operations.
The CIR, nonetheless, argues against the application of Section 8 here because the same had been purportedly repealed by Section 27 of the NIRC, as amended:
SECTION 27. Rates of Income Tax on Domestic Corporations. -
xxx   xxx   xxx
 
C) 
 
Government-owned or Controlled Corporations, Agencies or Instrumentalities. - The provisions of existing special or general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, all corporations, agencies, or instrumentalities owned or controlled by the Government, except the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Social Security System (SSS), the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), the local water districts (LWDs), and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), shall pay such rate of tax upon their taxable income as are imposed by this Section upon corporations or associations engaged in a similar business, industry, or activity.
The argument does not persuade. We agree with the CTA-En Banc that Section 27 is a general law while Section 8 of RA 7227, as amended by RA 7917 is a special law. As a rule, a general law cannot impliedly repeal a special law. 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Semirara Mining Corporation
[20]
 is 
apropos
:
As regards the claim of petitioner that respondent SMC's VAT exemption has already been repealed, this Court affirms the CTA decision that respondent SMC's VAT exemption remains intact. R.A. No. 9337's amendment of the NIRC did not remove the VAT exemption of respondent SMC xxx
xxx   xxx   xxx
xxx [T]his Court had the occasion to discuss in depth the reasons why PD No. 972 cannot be impliedly repealed by the repealing clause of R.A. No. 9337, a general law, to wit:
It is a fundamental rule in statutory construction that a special law cannot be repealed or modified by a subsequently enacted general law in the absence of any express provision in the latter law to that effect. A special law must be interpreted to constitute an exception to the general law in the absence of special circumstances warranting a contrary conclusion. The repealing clause of RA No. 9337, a general law, did not provide for the express repeal of PD No. 972, a special law xxx
xxx   xxx   xxx
xxx Had Congress intended to withdraw or revoke the tax exemptions under PD No. 972, it would have explicitly mentioned Section 16 of PD No. 972, in the same way that it specifically mentioned Section 13 of RA No. 6395 and Section 6, paragraph 5 of RA No. 9136, as among the laws repealed by RA No. 9337.
xxx   xxx   xxx
There are two categories of repeal by implication. The first is where provisions in the two acts on the same subject matter are in an irreconcilable conflict. The later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one. The second is if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate to repeal the earlier law.
Implied repeal by irreconcilable inconsistency takes place when the two statutes cover the same subject matter; they are so clearly inconsistent and incompatible with each other that they cannot be reconciled or harmonized; and both cannot be given effect, that is, that one law cannot [be] enforced without nullifying the other.
Another. Section 27 governs all corporations, agencies, or instrumentalities owned or controlled by the Government (GOCCs), with the exception of a few. It directs these GOCCs to "pay such rate of tax upon their taxable income as are imposed by this Section upon corporations or associations engaged in a similar business, industry, or activity." The directive 
presupposes
 that the funds are 
income
, hence, 
taxable
.
On the other hand, Section 8 of RA 7227, as amended by RA 7917, specifically governs BCDA's disposition of the properties enumerated therein and their sale proceeds. The law exempts these sale proceeds from all kinds of fees and taxes as the same law has already appropriated them for specific purposes and for designated beneficiaries.
It is settled that between a general law and a special law, the latter prevails. For a special law reveals the legislative intent more clearly than a general law does. Verily, the special law should be deemed an exception to the general law.
[21]
In light of the foregoing considerations, therefore, the standard procedural and documentary requirements for tax refund applicable to GOCCs in general do not apply to BCDA 
vis-a-vis
 the properties and the sale proceeds specified under Section 8 of RA 7227, as amended. To repeat, there is no income to speak of here; only the sale proceeds of specific properties which the legislature itself exempts from all taxes and fees.
ACCORDINGLY
, the petition is 
DENIED
