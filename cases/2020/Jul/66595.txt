Oscar Belleza, Norberto A. Murillo, Reina Mae A. Nasino, Dario Tomada, 
Emmanuel Bacarra, Oliver B. Rosales, and Lilia Bucatcat (petitioners) 
filed a petition before this Court entitled "
In the Matter of the Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the COVID
[1]
-19 
Pandemic
."
 Here, petitioners allege that they are prisoners and are among the 
elderly, sick, and pregnant population of inmates exposed to the danger 
of contracting COVID-19 where social distancing and self-isolation 
measures are purportedly impossible.
[2]

 As such, they are invoking this Court's power to exercise "equity 
jurisdiction" and are seeking "temporary liberty on humanitarian 
grounds" either on recognizance or on bail.
[3]

 Moreover, they are also asking the Court to order the creation of a 
"Prisoner Release Committee" similar to those set up in other countries 
to conduct a study and implement the release of prisoners in congested 
penal facilities. In seeking their provisional release on recognizance 
or bail, petitioners essentially argue that: (a) their continued 
confinement which poses a high risk of contracting COVID-19 is 
tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment proscribed under the 
Constitution;
[4]
 (b) the 
United Nations (UN) standards, particularly the UN Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), imposes a 
duty on the part of the State to protect the health and safety of 
prisoners consistent with the guarantees of the right to life;
[5]
 (c) the government's response to the pandemic is not enough to protect the safety of the inmates;
[6]

 (d) the government should take a cue from other countries which 
undertook measures to decongest their jails by releasing eligible 
prisoners;
[7]
 (e) the Court 
may brush aside procedural rules and grant temporary liberty based on 
humanitarian reasons and equity jurisdiction;
[8]
 and (f) it is not feasible for them to file petitions for 
certiorari
 with the trial courts due to the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).
[9]


 For respondents' part who are represented by the Office of the
 Solicitor General, they filed their comment opposing petitioners' plea 
for their temporary release and for the creation of a Prisoner Release 
Committee and argued that: (a) petitioners are valuable members of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines â New People's Army â National 
Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) who have committed heinous crimes and are
 merely taking advantage of the current public health as well as the 
"fickle arena of public opinion" situation in seeking for their 
temporary release based on humanitarian reasons;
[10]

 (b) the government has adequate medical facilities, personnel and 
measures to address the threat of COVID-19 in jails and other detention 
facilities;
[11]
 (c) 
petitioners have ample remedies under this Court's several circulars 
which addressed the needs to decongest the jails in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic;
[12]
 (d) petitioners violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts;
[13]

 (e) the grant or denial of bail, the evaluation of petitioners' 
respective medical conditions, and the determination of whether or not 
the evidence of guilt is strong are questions of fact which should be 
determined by the trial courts;
[14]
 (f) petitioners cannot be temporarily released on recognizance because they were charged with capital offenses;
[15]
 (g) petitioners cannot be granted provisional liberty based on equity because governing laws exist;
[16]
 (h) the doctrine espoused in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
[17]
 is inapplicable because petitioners present a threat to public safety due to their supposed membership in the CPP-NPA-NDF;
[18]

 (i) releasing petitioners violates the equal protection clause as there
 is no substantial difference between them and the rest of the detainees
 as everyone is equally vulnerable to COVID-19;
[19]

 and (j) the Philippines is not bound to adopt the manner of 
decongesting jails undertaken by other countries as they operate under 
their own set of laws.

Ruling


 The Supreme Court is a collegiate judicial body whose rulings 
and binding opinions are the results of its members' collective and 
majoritarian consensus. The doctrines it establishes do not depend on 
the judgment or will of a sole magistrate as such is the spirit of 
collegiality. Thus, after initial deliberations and exchanges of ideas, 
it was collectively realized that the instant case presents several 
complex issues making the interaction of applicable principles ridden 
with far-reaching implications. Nonetheless, the members of this Court 
have unanimously arrived at the conclusion to treat the petition as 
petitioners' application for bail or recognizance, as well as their 
motions for other practicable and suitable confinement arrangements 
relative to the alleged serious threats to their health and lives.  
  
 At the outset, it is a settled rule that the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.
[21]

 Relatedly, a direct invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction is
 generally proscribed to prevent inordinate demands upon its time and 
attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive
 jurisdiction as well as to prevent further over-crowding of its docket.
[22]

 Concomitantly, the Constitution guarantees the right to bail of all the
 accused except those charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 when the evidence of guilt is strong.
[23]
 However, in cases where the offense is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua 
and where the evidence of guilt is strong, bail is a matter of discretion.
[24]

 Here, trial courts are granted the discretion to determine in bail 
applications whether there is strong evidence of guilt on the part of 
the accused.
[25]
 A summary hearing is conducted merely for the purpose of determining the weight of evidence.
[26]

 Only after weighing the pieces of evidence as contained in the summary 
will the judge formulate his own conclusion as to whether the evidence 
of guilt against the accused is strong based on his discretion.
[27]
 Therefore, the entitlement to bail is a question of fact.
 In this case, petitioners have been charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
.
 As such, they are not entitled to bail as a matter of right. 
Consequently, there is a need to conduct summary hearings for the 
purpose of weighing the strength of the prosecution's evidence as to 
petitioners' guilt. This process entails a reception and an evaluation 
of evidence which the trial courts are competent to handle. The 
foregoing holds true with respect to the motions for other confinement 
arrangements which also necessitate reception and evaluation of evidence
 by a trial court. Hence, being a court of last resort, this Court 
ingeminates and reminds the Bench and the Bar that it is not the proper 
avenue or forum to ventilate factual questions especially if they are 
presented for adjudication on the first instance.
 Like the case of 
Versoza v. People, et al.
[28]
 and 
Cruz, et al. v. Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, et al.
[29]

 the Court deems it fitting to have the other remaining issues threshed 
out in the separate opinions of its members that are attached to and 
made integral parts of this Decision.
 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing reasons, the Court 
TREATS 
the
 present petition as petitioners' applications for bail or recognizance 
as well as their motions for other confinement arrangements, and 
REFERS
 the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal cases are pending, which courts are hereby 
DIRECTED 
to
 conduct the necessary proceedings and consequently, resolve these 
incidents with utmost dispatch. Accordingly, the proceedings before this
 Court are considered 
CLOSED
 and 
TERMINATED

 No pronouncement as to costs.

SEPARATE OPINION


PERALTA, 
C.J.
:


 I join the majority in treating the instant petition as 
petitioners' application for bail or recognizance. I submit this 
opinion, however, in order to articulate my views on some salient 
points.


 The instant Petition
[1]
 
calls for the release of prisoners on humanitarian grounds in the midst 
of the pandemic created by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
 that now grips the world at the neck.
 Petitioners, who deem 
themselves as political prisoners detained in various penal institutions
 in the country, profess that they are most vulnerable to COVID-19 as 
they are either elderly, pregnant, or afflicted with hypertension and/or
 diabetes. Believing that an outbreak of the disease in their respective
 places of confinement is not unlikely owing to what they perceive to be
 hellish conditions in highly-congested local prisons, they fear that 
they stand to be the most susceptible to infection if and when such 
outbreak does occur.
[2]
 

 In support of this bid, petitioners cite a number of medical reports 
and abstracts tending to demonstrate that the elderly, sickly and those 
already afflicted with certain ailments, are the easiest victims of the 
novel disease.
[3]
 Thus, they 
plead for their release from confinement either on bail or recognizance,
 as well as for the creation, by directive of the Court, of a Prisoner 
Release Committee with accompanying ground rules for the conditional 
release of similarly situated prisoners.
[4]

 They invoke humanitarian considerations based on international law 
principles, specifically those embodied in the Revised United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (
The Mandela Rule of 2015
) and Article 9.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (
ICCPR
).
[5]
 
 By way of Comment,
[6]
 the Office of the Solicitor General (
OSG
)
 advocates for the dismissal of the petition based on outright violation
 of judicial hierarchy. It explains that the plea should be offered 
before the courts where petitioners' respective cases are being heard, 
and not directly with the High Court. It also calls attention to the 
fact that petitioners have all been charged and, except for one
[7]

 who has already met conviction and is currently serving sentence, are 
under prosecution for non-bailable offenses in relation to their alleged
 membership in the CPP-NPA-NDF. More than half of them are in custody at
 Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City and none of them has yet been reported to
 exhibit signs of infection. 
 As said, the Petition must be treated as petitioners' application for bail or recognizance. 
 
I


 The release of petitioners on bail is restricted by twin 
fundamental provisions of the Constitution and the Rules of Court. 
Section 7 of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court instructs that a person 
charged with a capital offense or with an offense punishable by
 reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment shall not be entitled to bail when the evidence of guilt is strong.
[8]

 The rule echoes from Section 13, Article III of the Constitution which 
stresses that bail, while ordinarily a right of an accused, is not 
available to those charged of a capital offense or an offense punishable
 by life imprisonment or 
reclusion perpetua
 when the evidence of guilt is strong.
[9]


 Here, petitioners are all charged with crimes or offenses that are punishable by death, life imprisonment or 
reclusion perpetua
.
 Worse, one of them was already convicted by the trial court. Hence, 
none of the petitioners can claim to be entitled to bail as a matter of 
right. Their entitlement to bail is a matter reposed to judicial 
discretionâparticularly, to the discretion of the court where their 
cases are pending. 
 The question of whether petitioners are 
deserving of provisional liberty, much more of whether the evidence of 
guilt against them are strong, are certainly questions of fact. 
Resolving such questions in the first instance is not, and has never 
been, the province of this Court. It is not difficult to see the merit 
in the OSG's argument, therefore, that the instant petition suffers from
 infirmityâfor the same not only ignores the doctrine of hierarchy of 
courtsâbut also implores this Court to act on a matter that lies outside
 its competence as it is not ordinarily legally equipped to evaluate 
evidence respecting the right to bail.
 Indeed, judicial 
discretion in granting bail may be exercised only after pertinent 
evidence is submitted to a court during a bail hearing after due notice 
to the prosecution.
[10]
 The 
necessity, if not indispensability, of a bail hearing under the 
circumstances is all the more revealed if we consider that certain 
factors in the fixing of a bail bondâsuch as the nature and 
circumstances of the crime, character and reputation of the accused, the
 weight of the evidence against him, the probability of the accused 
appearing at the trial, whether or not the accused is a fugitive from 
justice, and whether or not the accused is under bond in other 
casesâunequivocally require the presentation of evidence and a 
reasonable opportunity for the prosecution to refute it.
[11]

 Yet, petitioners argue that it would be unreasonable to require them to
 follow the usual procedure in applying for bail given the threat of the
 COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the whole Luzon has been placed 
under enhanced community quarantine. 
 The argument fails to convince. 

 We remind petitioners that neither the pandemic nor the executive 
declaration of a Luzon-wide lockdown has the effect of suspending our 
laws and rules, much less of shutting down the Judiciary. 
 
Contrary to petitioners' insinuation, applying for bail before trial 
courts has not been rendered infeasible even amidst the COVID-19 
pandemic and the Luzon-wide lockdown. In Administrative Circular (
AC
) No. 31-2020, issued on March 16, 2020, this Court explicitly assured that court hearings on urgent mattersâincluding that of "
petitions, motions or pleadings related to bail
"âwill continue during the entire period of the community quarantine. 

 In addition, the Court has issued several circulars specifically aimed 
at facilitating and expediting the release of certain persons deprived 
of liberty (
PDL
) at the height of the present COVID-19 pandemic. Thus:
 
1.) In AC No. 33-2020,
[12]

 the Court specifically allowed the electronic filing of applications 
for bail and granted trial court judges a wider latitude of discretion 
for a lowered bail amount effective during the period of the present 
public health emergency. The Circular also sanctioned the electronic 
transmission of bail application approvals and directed the consequent 
release order to be issued within the same day to the proper law 
enforcement authority or detention facility to enable the release of the
 accused. 
 2.) In AC No. 34-2020,
[13]

 on the other hand, the Court expanded the efficacy of electronic filing
 of criminal complaints and informations, together with bail 
applications, to keep up with the executive determination of the need to
 extend the period of the enhanced community quarantine in critical 
regions of the country. 
 3.) In AC No. 37-2020,
[14]

 the Court ordered the pilot-testing of videoconference hearings on 
urgent matters in criminal cases, including bail applications, in 
critical regions where the risk of viral transmission is high. 
 4.) Finally, in AC No. 38-2020,
[15]

 the Court authorized the grant of reduced bail and recognizance to 
indigent PDLs pending the continuation of the proceedings and the 
resolution of their cases.
 
 These issuances, accompanied by pertinent circulars
[16]
 emanating from the Office of the Court Administrator (
OCA
),
 had, in fact, facilitated the gradual and incremental release of 33,790
 detention prisoners from March 17 to June 22, 2020 as follows:

II




 An examination of the substance of the instant Petition would further reveal its inaptness. 
 Invoking equity considerations, petitioners allude to the doctrines in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan, et al
.
[18]
 and 
De la Rama v. The People's Court
[19]

 where the accused were allowed temporary liberty on account of proven 
medical condition as their continued incarceration was shown to be 
further injurious to their health and would endanger their lives.
[20]
 The OSG, on the other hand, rebuffs this allusion by positing that 
Enrile
 cannot be relied upon as a precedent because it is a 
pro hac vice
 ruling. 
 While I believe that petitioners' invocation of 
Enrile
 is misplaced, I take exception to the OSG's characterization of the ruling in that case as 
pro hac vice
. 
 
Pro hac vice
 is a Latin term meaning "
for this one particular occasion
."
[21]
 Similarly, a 
pro hac vice
 ruling is one "
expressly qualified as x x x cannot be relied upon as a precedent to govern other cases
.
"
[22]
 The Court never expressly qualified the
 Enrile
 ruling as having only a 
pro hac vice

 application. In fact, the Court, even if it minded to, could not have 
validly made such qualification, considering that the promulgation of 
pro hac vice
 decisions has already been declared as illegal in our jurisdiction. In the 2017 
en banc
 case of 
Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc
.
[23]
 we held:



 
Pro hac vice
 means a specific decision does not constitute a
 precedent because the decision is for the specific case only, not to be
 followed in other cases. 
A 
pro hac vice
 decision violates 
statutory law - Article 8 of the Civil Code - which states that 
"judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the 
Constitution shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines
." The decision of the Court in this case cannot be 
pro hac vice
 because by mandate of the law every decision of the Court forms part of the legal system of the Philippines. 
If
 another case comes up with the same facts as the present case, that 
case must be decided in the same way as this case to comply with the 
constitutional mandate of equal protection of the law. Thus, a 
pro hac vice
 decision also violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Petitioners err in their invocation of 
Enrile
 simply because the circumstances in that case are different from the circumstances herein. 
 
First
, the petitioner in 
Enrile
âthe Senator Juan Ponce Enrileâunderwent bail hearing with the 
Sandiganbayan
 prior to his resort to this Court. What Senator Enrile assailed before this Court then was the Sandiganbayan's denial of his 
Motion to Fix Bail
 and its 
Motion for Reconsideration
.
 In the instant case, however, petitioners are asking the Court to grant
 their provisional liberty by way of bail or recognizance without filing
 a motion before the trial courts having jurisdiction over their 
respective cases. 
 
Second
, in his bail hearing for the 
Sandiganbayan
,
 Senator Enrile was able to present evidence of his current fragile 
state of health. Based on that, the Court was able to infer that Senator
 Enrile's advanced age and ill health required special medical 
attention. On the other hand, to prove their medical conditions, 
petitioners herein attached medical certificates and other documents in 
their petition. However, the Court cannot simply take judicial notice of
 petitioners' age and health conditions. Judicial notice is the 
cognizance of certain facts that judges may properly take and act on 
without proof because these facts are already known to them; it is the 
duty of the court to assume something as matters of fact without need of
 further evidentiary support.
[24]

 Age and health conditions necessitate the presentation of evidence. 
This further emphasizes the need to conduct a bail hearing. 
 
Lastly
, Senator Enrile's medical condition was not the only consideration why he was afforded the benefit of bail. In 
Enrile
,
 the Court affirmed the right to bail because Senator Enrile was 
likewise not shown to be a danger to the community and his risk of 
flight was nil - a conclusion that was impelled not only by his social 
and political standing, but also by his voluntary surrender to the 
authorities. Thus -



 In our view, his social and political standing and his having 
immediately surrendered to the authorities upon his being charged in 
court indicate that the risk of his flight or escape from this 
jurisdiction is highly unlikely. His personal disposition from the onset
 of his indictment for plunder, formal or otherwise, has demonstrated 
his utter respect for the legal processes of this country. We also do 
not ignore that at an earlier time many years ago when he had been 
charged with rebellion with murder and multiple frustrated murder, he 
already evinced a similar personal disposition of respect for the legal 
processes, and was granted bail during the pendency of his trial because
 he was not seen as a flight risk. With his solid reputation in both his
 public and his private lives, his long years of public service, and 
history's judgment of him being at stake, he should be granted bail.

 The Court is mindful that a contagion within the country's penal 
institutions is neither unlikely nor impossible. Yet, we take judicial 
notice of the fact that following the executive declaration of a public 
health emergency in March, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (
BJMP
)
 and the Bureau of Corrections, under a joint mandate to protect the 
health and safety of all PDLs and detention prisoners, have implemented 
preventive and precautionary measures against a potential COVID-19 
outbreak in detention and correctional facilities. The measures include 
the total lockdown of penal institutions, the designation of isolation 
facilities within premises, the procurement of personal protective 
equipment, as well as nutrition and on-site education campaigns. Only 
recently, the Bureau of Corrections has also put in place necessary 
infrastructure to provide inmates facility for online visits/video 
conference with their relatives. 
 Be that as it may, petitioners 
would now have the Court follow the global trend of late, whereby 
various governments have taken swift unprecedented measures in 
decongesting prison facilities by allowing an exodus of prisoners on 
conditional or temporary liberty to mitigate the effects of an on-site 
community transmission of COVID-19 or otherwise curb that possibility. 
It bears to stress, however, that these initiatives were based on laws 
and rules prevailing in those jurisdictions. For instance, the directive
 for the release of prisoners in the territories of India applies only 
to those convicted or charged with offenses punishable with less than 
seven years of jail term.
[26]
 

 At any rate, the Philippines did not lag behind in this respect. As I 
have already pointed out, this Court - mindful of the circumstantial 
vulnerabilities present in detention and correctional facilities across 
the country, as well as of the limits of its own power and competence - 
has already caused, through its various issuances in response to the 
pandemic, the seamless release of 33,790
[27]

 detention prisoners in a most expeditious way but in line with existing
 fundamental laws, rules and legal processes. Such issuances, in turn, 
complement on-going efforts by executive agencies to expedite the 
release of PDLs via parole, pardon and executive clemency. Indeed, the 
latest figures from the Department of Justice indicate that, as a direct
 result of implementing its 
Interim Rules on Parole and Executive Clemency
[28]
 which took effect last May 15, 2020, the Board of Pardons and Parole (
BPP
)
 was already able to grant parole to 221 PDLs, recommend the release on 
conditional pardon of 56 others, and endorse the commutation of sentence
 of 56 more from May 18, 2020 to June 10, 2020âa period of only less 
than a month.
[29]
 These, in addition to the earlier reported release by the BJMP of some 4,188 PDLs from March 17 to April 30, 2020.
[30]

 Undeniably, such parallel efforts by the Judiciary and executive show 
the government's commitment in maximizing, nay, in exhausting, every 
available legal means in order to decongest the country's detention and 
correction facilities amidst the current national health crisis. 
 
III


 At this juncture, we stress that unless there is clear showing 
that petitioners are actually suffering from a medical condition that 
requires immediate and specialized attention outside of their current 
confinement - as, for instance, an actual and proven exposure to or 
infection with the novel coronavirus - they must remain in custody and 
isolation incidental to the crimes with which they were charged, or for 
which they are being tried or serving sentence. Only then can there be 
an actual controversy and a proper invocation of humanitarian and equity
 considerations that is ripe for this Court to determine. 
 We 
come to the conclusion that petitioners are probably seeking 
administrative - not judicial - remedies that would genuinely address 
their concerns in regard to which this Court, as overseer of the 
Judiciary, could exercise no other prerogative than to: (a) treat the 
instant petition as petitioners' application for bail or recognizance, 
(b) refer the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal 
cases are pending for resolution and (c) direct said courts to resolve 
such incidents with deliberate dispatch. That judicial remedy is 
unavailable to the reliefs prayed for, is all the more apparent from 
their collective sentiment that the government-imposed quarantine and 
lockdown measures, which in the interim necessarily denied them of 
supervised access to their families and friends, have negatively 
affected their mental well-being. As they hereby complain about 
languishing in isolation, they fail to see that in truth, the rest of 
the outside world is likewise socially isolating as a basic 
precautionary measure in response to a pandemic of this kind. They 
lament the lingering fear of a potential infection within their 
confinement on account of their respective physical vulnerabilities and 
hereby plead that they be indefinitely set free, without realizing it is
 that same exact fear which looms outside of prison walls. 
 
WHEREFORE
, I vote to: (a) 
TREAT 
the instant petition as petitioners' application for bail or recognizance, (b) 
REFER
 the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal cases are pending for resolution, and (c) 
DIRECT
 said courts to resolve such incidents with deliberate dispatch.

SEPARATE OPINION
 


PERLAS-BERNABE, 
J
.:
 


I concur in the result. As I have proposed from the inception of 
this case, the instant petition should be treated as petitioners' 
respective applications for bail/recognizance, as well as their motions 
for suitable and practicable confinement arrangements, and consequently,
 be referred to the proper trial courts for the conduct of further 
proceedings. However, due to the collective decision of the membership 
to confine the 
ponencia
 to this unanimous disposition subject 
to separate opinions on some significant constitutional issues, I am 
impelled to submit this Separate Opinion to explain the reasons and 
justifications for my concurrence.


 
I. Prayer for Release on Bail/Recognizance.


Primarily, petitioners seek direct recourse to the Court for 
their temporary release on recognizance or, in the alternative, bail, 
"for the duration of the state of public health emergency, national 
calamity, lockdown[,] and community quarantine due to the threats of x x
 x [Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)]."
[1]


 At its core, bail "acts as a reconciling mechanism to 
accommodate both the accused's interest in pretrial liberty and 
society's interest in assuring the accused's presence at trial."
[2]
 Its purpose is "to guarantee the appearance of the accused at the trial, or whenever so required by the trial court."
[3]

 Similarly, "[r]ecognizance is a mode of securing the release of any 
person in custody or detention for the commission of an offense" but is 
made available to those who are "unable to post bail due to abject 
poverty."
[4]


 Our Constitution and statutes prescribe a legal framework in 
granting bail or recognizance to persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) 
pending final conviction. The Constitution denies bail, as a matter of 
right, to "those charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 when evidence of guilt is strong."
[5]

 In the same vein, Republic Act No. (RA) 10389, known as the 
"Recognizance Act of 2012," provides that recognizance is not a matter 
of right when the offense is punishable by "death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment"
[6]
 and as per its implementing rules, "when the evidence of guilt is strong,"
[7]
 consistent with the Constitution.
  
 When the accused is charged with an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
,
 or life imprisonment, the usual procedure is for the accused to apply 
for bail with notice to the prosecutor. Thereafter, the judge is 
mandated to conduct a hearing to primarily determine the existence of 
strong evidence of guilt or lack of it, against the accused. When the 
evidence of guilt is not strong, the judge is then tasked to fix the 
amount of bail taking into account the guidelines set forth in Section 
9, Rule 114 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. In 
Cortes v. Catral
,
[8]
 the Court explained:
    


 [W]hether bail is a matter of right or of discretion, 
reasonable notice of hearing is required to be given to the prosecutor 
or fiscal or at least he must be asked for his recommendation because in
 fixing the amount of bail, the judge is required to take into account a
 number of factors such as the applicant's character and reputation, 
forfeiture of other bonds or whether he is a fugitive from justice.


 When a person is charged with an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
[,]
 or life imprisonment, bail is a matter of discretion. Rule 114, Section
 7 of the Rules of Court states: "No person charged with a capital 
offense, or an offense punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 or life 
imprisonment when the evidence of guilt is strong, shall be admitted to 
bail regardless of the stage of the criminal action." 
Consequently, when the accused is charged with an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
[,]
 or life imprisonment, the judge is mandated to conduct a hearing, 
whether summary or otherwise in the discretion of the court, not only to
 take into account the guidelines set forth in Section 9, Rule 114 of 
the Rules of Court, but primarily to determine the existence of strong 
evidence of guilt or lack of it, against the accused
.
[9]
 (Underscoring supplied)




 Pursuant to procedural rules, the accused may also seek a reduction of the recommended bail amount,
[10]
 or seek a release through recognizance upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth by law.
[11]


 In this case, petitioners are all charged with offenses that are punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment.
[12]
 In fact, one of them had already been convicted by the trial court and her appeal is pending resolution.
[13]

 Petitioners have not shown that any of them has filed the necessary 
bail applications. It was neither shown that bail hearings were 
conducted in their respective cases in order to determine whether or not
 there exists strong evidence of guilt against them, which would, in 
turn, determine their qualification or disqualification for the reliefs 
prayed for. 
    
 "Strong evidence of guilt" entails the submission of 
evidence by the parties, and consequently, a circumspect factual 
determination. 
The Court is not a trier of facts
, and hence, is not competent to engage itself in such a laborious endeavor. 
Institutionally,
 the Court does not function like a trial court where hearings are 
conducted for the presentation of evidence by the litigants involved. 
Accordingly,
 it is incapable of determining whether or not any of the petitioners 
may be released on bail or recognizance pursuant to the provisions of 
law and the Constitution. 
    
 This notwithstanding, petitioners seek temporary liberty - 
specifically, through bail or recognizance - on humanitarian grounds, 
invoking this Court's equity jurisdiction. It is hornbook doctrine, 
however, that equity comes into play only in the absence of law. "Equity
 is justice outside legal provisions, and must be exercised in the 
absence of law, not against it."
[14]

 As mentioned, there is a prescribed legal framework in granting bail or
 recognizance to PDLs pending final conviction. Bail or recognizance 
cannot be granted to persons who are charged with capital offenses when 
the evidence of guilt against them is strong. 
Hence, the Court would 
be betraying its mandate to apply the law and the Constitution should it
 prematurely order the release of petitioners on bail or recognizance 
absent the requisite hearing to determine whether or not the evidence of guilt against them is strong
.
 While it is noted that this was done in the past in the case of 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
 (
Enrile
),
[15]
 the majority ruling in that case should be deemed as "
pro hac vice
" in light of the past Senator's "solid reputation in both his private and public lives"
[16]
 and "his fragile state of health"
[17]
 which deserved immediate medical attention. 
    
 To understand the peculiarity of
 Enrile
, one may simply consult the majority Decision therein which would readily show, on its face, that 
no
 bail hearing to determine the existence of "strong evidence of guilt" 
against Enrile was conducted. In fact, the absence of this requisite 
hearing was precisely the reason why the 
Sandiganbayan
 denied Enrile's motion to fix bail on the ground of prematurity:




 On June 5, 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman charged Enrile and several others with plunder in the 
Sandiganbayan

 on the basis of their purported involvement in the diversion and misuse
 of appropriations under the Priority Development Assistance Fund 
(PDAF). On June 10, 2014 and June 16, 2014, Enrile respectively filed 
his Omnibus Motion and Supplemental Opposition, praying, among others, 
that he be allowed to post bail should probable cause be found against 
him. The motions were heard by the 
Sandiganbayan
 after the Prosecution filed its Consolidated Opposition. 


 On July 3, 2014, the 
Sandiganbayan
 issued its 
resolution denying Enrile's motion, particularly on the matter of bail, 
on the ground of its prematurity[,] considering that Enrile had not yet 
then voluntarily surrendered or been placed under the custody of the 
law. Accordingly, the
 Sandiganbayan
 ordered the arrest of Enrile. 


 On the same day that the warrant for his arrest was issued, 
Enrile voluntarily surrendered to Director Benjamin Magalong of the 
Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in Camp Crame, Quezon 
City, and was later on confined at the Philippine National Police (PNP) 
General Hospital following his medical examination. 


 Thereafter, Enrile filed his Motion for Detention at the PNP 
General Hospital, and his Motion to Fix Bail, both dated July 7, 2014, 
which were heard by the 
Sandiganbayan
 on July 8, 2014. In support
 of the motions, Enrile argued that he should be allowed to post bail 
because: (a) the Prosecution had not yet established that the evidence 
of his guilt was strong; (b) although he was charged with plunder, the 
penalty as to him would only be 
reclusion temporal
, not
 reclusion perpetua
; and (c) he was not a flight risk, and his age and physical condition must further be seriously considered. 


 On July 14, 2014, the 
Sandiganbayan
 issued its first assailed resolution denying Enrile's Motion to Fix Bail, disposing thusly: 




 . . . 
[I]t is only after the prosecution shall have 
presented its evidence and the Court shall have made a determination 
that the evidence of guilt is not strong against accused Enrile can he 
demand bail as a matter of right. Then and only then will the Court be 
duty-bound to fix the amount of his bail. 


 
To be sure, no such determination has been made by the
 Court. In fact, accused Enrile has not filed an application for bail. 
Necessarily, no bail hearing can even commence. It is thus exceedingly 
premature for accused Enrile to ask the Court to fix his bail
.
[18]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) 






 To my mind, the majority ruling in 
Enrile
, which in turn, cited 
De La Rama v. The People's Court
,
[19]

 is an unusual judicial precedent which strays from the prescribed legal
 course on bail or recognizance. For a person charged with a capital 
offense, a bail hearing is necessary to determine whether or not the 
accused may nonetheless be released on account of the established 
finding that the evidence against him or her is not strong. This 
requirement finds force in none other than our Constitution. At any 
rate, the foregoing special considerations taken into account by the 
majority therein were not shown to attend in this case. Hence, 
petitioners cannot invoke the 
Enrile
 ruling to successfully obtain their desired relief. 
    
 Petitioners, however, should not be completely barren of any relief from this Court. 
In the 
interest of substantial justice
,
 and considering that the present petition is the first of its kind in 
the context of this novel public health situation, the Court may relax 
the usual procedure requiring that bail applications be first filed 
before the trial courts, and instead, treat the instant petition as 
petitioners' respective bail applications and refer the same to the 
proper trial courts.
 Thereafter, the trial courts having 
jurisdiction over petitioners' respective cases must determine the 
merits of the bail applications. 
However, before proceeding, they 
must first ascertain whether or not previous bail applications have been
 filed by petitioners and their status
. This 
preliminary determination
 upon referral to the respective trial courts would result into the following possible scenarios: 
    
 (1) If a bail application had already been previously filed 
and consequently denied by the trial court, then the denial must stand 
on the ground that there is already a determination that the evidence of
 guilt against the accused-petitioner charged with a capital offense is 
strong and hence, need not be re-litigated further; 
    
 (2) If a bail application had already been previously filed 
but had yet to be resolved by the trial court, the bail hearings should 
just continue, taking into account the submissions in the present 
petition; or
    
 (3) If no bail application was previously filed and bail 
hearings have yet to be conducted to determine whether or not the 
evidence of guilt against an accused-petitioner charged with a capital 
offense is strong, then the trial court must, with notice to the 
prosecutor, conduct the necessary proceedings to make such 
determination. 
    
 Once it is determined that the evidence against an 
accused-petitioner (or any accused for that matter) is not strong and 
hence, qualified for bail or recognizance, he or she should then be 
given an opportunity to present evidence showing, 
inter alia
, his
 or her age and medical condition. As per our Rules of Criminal 
Procedure, these factors must be taken into account in determining the 
reasonable amount of bail to be imposed.
[20]


 To reiterate, this petition is the first of its kind in the 
context of this novel public health situation. It is apt to mention that
 the petition was filed back on April 8, 2020.
[21]

 Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that at that time, the 
COVID-19 pandemic was at its unnerving onset. Public uncertainty, 
confusion, and paranoia were at their peak, and the government, as a 
whole, was just beginning to reckon the proper policy approach in 
dealing with a pandemic of historical and global proportions. Therefore,
 with the life-concerning threat of the COVID-19 pandemic hanging above 
their heads, petitioners directly resorted to this Court to seek their 
temporary release. Verily, humanitarian considerations juxtaposed 
against the novelty of the public health situation, especially with the 
emerging public perception at that time, dictate that instead of denying
 the petition outright, partial relief be accorded to them. 
    
 It deserves highlighting that there would be no harm in 
treating the petition as petitioners' respective bail applications, and 
referring them to the proper trial courts. 
The procedure for referral
 as herein proposed is not some groundbreaking innovation; it is but 
analogous to remand directives which have been customarily done by the 
Court.
 Needless to state, non-traditional procedures such as this are clearly within the powers of the Court
[22]

 and are permissible when there are compelling reasons to further the 
higher interests of substantial justice, as in this case. While this may
 not be the ordinary procedure, the circumstances so warrant the 
discretionary relaxation of our rules. 
    
 A caveat, however, must be made: the unique situation of 
petitioners as being the first litigants to file such petition before 
the Court only obtains as to them. Henceforth, it is my view that PDLs 
similarly situated as petitioners should follow the existing rules of 
procedure and Court issuances on filing bail/recognizance applications 
before the proper inferior courts having jurisdiction over their 
respective cases. 
    
 
II. Prayer for "Other Non-Custodial Measures." 


 Our laws on bail or recognizance do not account for prison 
conditions as a ground for provisional liberty under these specific 
legal modes. Under our existing legal framework, the right to be 
released on bail or recognizance is anchored only on the nature of the 
charge and on whether or not there exists strong evidence of guilt 
against the accused. Nevertheless, nothing prevents an accused from 
seeking a different imprisonment arrangement if he or she is able to 
prove that his or her life is greatly prejudiced by his or her continued
 confinement. Neither are courts prohibited from granting an accused 
such practicable alternative confinement arrangements to protect his or 
her life, although not considered as bail or recognizance in the 
traditional sense of our laws. After all, our statutes command that 
"[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason of the 
silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws,"
[23]

 and "[i]n case of doubt in the interpretation or application of laws, 
it is presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice to 
prevail."
[24]


 As our current legal framework does not specify the 
parameters for these reliefs, it is submitted that they be adjudged 
according to the deliberate indifference standard adopted in foreign 
jurisprudence. However, before delving into this topic, I find it 
imperative to discuss some fundamental principles relative to the right 
to life in light of the subhuman conditions of our prison system. This 
springs from the insinuations during the deliberations on this case that
 it is the legislative's task to remedy our subhuman prison conditions, 
and that the right to life does not include the right against cruel and 
unusual punishment under Section 19, Article III of the 1987 
Constitution. 
    
 There is no quibbling that courts are duty-bound to 
recognize a person's right to life, and grant permissible reliefs 
despite, and to reiterate, the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of 
our laws. This command is founded on none other than the fundamental 
law, particularly in our Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution. 
A person's right to life 
â
 whether accused of a crime or not 
â

 is inalienable and does not take a back seat nor become dormant just 
because of the lack of necessary legislation to address our subhuman 
prison conditions.
 
When the right to life is at stake, the Bill 
of Rights operates; making a fair and just ruling to preserve the right 
to life is not entirely dependent on some unpassed legislation that 
directs the structural improvement of our jails or allocates budget to 
improve our penal institutions
. It must be borne in mind that Section 4 (a) of RA 10575
[25]
 expressly states that: 
    


 Section 4. 
The Mandates of the Bureau of Corrections.
 - x x x


 (a) Safekeeping of National Inmates - The safekeeping of 
inmates shall include decent provision of quarters, food, water and 
clothing 
in compliance with established United Nations standards
.
 The security of the inmates shall be undertaken by the Custodial Force 
consisting of Corrections Officers with a ranking system and salary 
grades similar to its counterpart in the [Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology (BJMP)]. (Emphasis supplied) 




 This is in accord with the State's policy expressed in Section 2 of the same law: 
    


 Section 2. 
Declaration of Policy
. - 
It is the policy
 of the State to promote the general welfare and safeguard the basic 
rights of every prisoner incarcerated in our national penitentiary.
 
It also recognizes the responsibility of the State to strengthen 
government capability aimed towards the institutionalization of highly 
efficient and competent correctional services. 


 Towards this end, the State shall provide for the 
modernization, professionalization and restructuring of the Bureau of 
Corrections (BuCor) by upgrading its facilities, increasing the number 
of its personnel, upgrading the level of qualifications of their 
personnel and standardizing their base pay, retirement and other 
benefits, making it at par with that of the [BJMP]. (Emphasis supplied) 




 These United Nations standards pertain to the Nelson Mandela Rules issued by the UN General Assembly: 
    


 The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, 
originally adopted by the First UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime

 Under the 1987 Constitution, international law can become part
 of the sphere of domestic law either by transformation or

The transformation method requires that an 
international law be transformed into a domestic law through a

 With the foregoing in mind, it is therefore incorrect to say 
that the Nelson Mandela Rules are absolutely not judicially enforceable 
in our jurisdiction. By authority of our laws, courts may already 
recognize the effects of our subhuman prison conditions and grant proper
 reliefs based on the circumstances of the case. To be sure, the lack of
 laws allocating budget for the structural improvement of our jails in 
order to address subhuman conditions does not mean that our courts are 
powerless to grant permissible reliefs which are grounded on the Bill of
 Rights of our Constitution. In this relation, it must be emphasized 
that when the court grants such reliefs, it does not venture in policy 
making or meddle in matters of implementation; 
after all, it 
cannot compel - as petitioners do not even pray to compel - Congress to 
make laws or pass a budget for whatever purpose
. 
Policy 
making towards improving our jail conditions is a separate and distinct 
function from adjudicating Bill of Rights concerns upon a valid claim of
 serious and critical life threats while incarcerated.
 The former is within the province of Congress, the latter is within the Court's.
    
 Additionally, in response to one view,
[33]
 let me stress that 
the
 protection of the right against cruel and unusual punishment pursuant 
to Section 19, Article III of our Constitution is not completely left to
 the determination of legislature. 
To recount, the exchanges during 
the constitutional deliberations evince the intent of the Framers to 
create a provision explicitly recognizing the problem of our substandard
 jail conditions and that Congress 
"should do something about it"
; hence, the phrase "should be dealt with BY LAW":
    






MR. REGALADO: 


Madam President, I am 
proposing a further amendment to put some standards on this, to read: 
"The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING punishment ON 
ANY PRISONER."






 


 








Please permit me to explain. The 
punishment may not be physical but it could be degrading. Perhaps, the 
Members have seen the picture of that girl who was made to parade around
 the Manila International Airport with a placard slung on her neck, 
reading "I am a thief."






 


 








That is a degrading form of 
punishment. It may not necessarily be corporal nor physical. That is why
 I ask for the inclusion of OR DEGRADING "punishment" on this line and 
employment should be ON ANY PRISONER. It includes a convicted prisoner 
or a detention prisoner.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Where would the words be? 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


"The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING punishment ON ANY PRISONER." This is all-inclusive. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


In other words, the Commissioner 
seeks to delete the words "against CONVICTED prisoners or pretrial 
detainees," and in its place would be "ON ANY PRISONER." 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


Because in penal law, there are two 
kinds of prisoners: the prisoners convicted by final judgment and those 
who are detention prisoners. Delete "or pretrial detainees"; then, "or 
the use of GROSSLY substandard or INADEQUATE penal facilities." 
If we just say "substandard," we have no basis to determine against what standard it should be considered
. But if we say âGROSSLY substandard," that is 
enough of a legislative indication and guideline
.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Madam President, before we take it up
 one by one, the Committee modification actually deleted the words 
"substandard or outmoded," and in its place, we put the word INADEQUATE.
 Is it the Gentleman's position that we should put back the word 
"substandard" instead of "INADEQUATE"?






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


I put both, "or the use of GROSSLY 
substandard or INADEQUATE penal facilities," because the penal 
facilities may be adequate for a specific purpose but it may be 
substandard when considered collectively and vice-versa; and then, 
we delete the rest, "should be dealt with BY LAW.
" That capsulizes, I think, the intent of the sponsor of the amendment.






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


If we add the word "GROSSLY," we are almost saying that the legislature should act only if the situation is gross. 






 


 






MR. REGALADO: 


How do we determine what is substandard?
 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


We leave that to the legislature.

 What I am saying is that the legislature could say: "Well, this is 
substandard but it is not grossly substandard; therefore, we need not do
 anything about it. 






 


 






MR. REGALADO: 


Could we have a happy 
compromise on how the substandard categorization could come in
 because it 
may be substandard from the standpoint of American models 
but
 it may be sufficient for us
? 






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


I do not think we should go into great details on this. We are not legislating... 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


So, the sponsor's position is that 
we just 
leave it to the legislature
 to have a legislative 
standard of their own
 in the 
form of an ordinary legislation
? 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


Yes

 However, nowhere is it shown that the Framers intended to 
completely insulate the matter of subhuman jail conditions from judicial
 relief when a substantial relation to a person's right to life is 
convincingly made. 
In my opinion, the right to life permutates to the
 prohibition against any form of cruel and unusual punishment against 
one's person. When serious and critical threats to one's life are 
adequately proven by virtue of one's conditions while incarcerated, the 
Court must fill in the void in the law and grant permissible reliefs.

 Under extraordinary circumstances, temporary transfers or other 
confinement arrangements, when so proven to be practicable and 
warranted, may be therefore decreed by our courts if only to save the 
life of an accused, who is, after all, still accorded the presumption of
 innocence. Indeed, an accused cannot just be left to perish and die in 
jail in the midst of a devastating global pandemic, without any recourse
 whatsoever. At the risk of belaboring the point, the lack of laws 
addressing the subhuman conditions of our prison system does not mean 
that our courts are rendered powerless to grant permissible reliefs, 
especially to those who have yet to be finally convicted of the crimes 
they were charged with. 
The Court's duty to protect our Bill of Rights is constant â respecting the right to life is constant.

 To deny relief on the excuse that it is Congress' responsibility to 
institutionally improve our prison systems is tantamount to judicial 
abdication of this perpetual tenet. 


 At this juncture, it is relevant to point out that the main thrust of preventive imprisonment is not to punish 
â
 as there is yet no penalty 
â

 but rather, to protect society from potential convicts and their 
propensity to commit further crimes. Preventive imprisonment also 
ensures that the court having jurisdiction over the case may properly 
conduct the necessary proceedings and effectuate its decision. In 
United States v. Salerno
,
[35]

 the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) touched upon this basic
 premise that pretrial detention does not serve as a punishment for 
dangerous individuals: 
    


 Although a court could detain an arrestee who threatened to 
flee before trial, such detention would be permissible because it would 
serve the basic objective of a criminal system 
â
 bringing the accused to trial. x x x


 x x x x


 We conclude that the detention imposed by the Act falls on the regulatory side of the dichotomy. 
The
 legislative history of the Bail Reform Act clearly indicates that 
Congress did not formulate the pretrial detention provisions as 
punishment for dangerous individuals. 
x x x 
Congress instead perceived pretrial detention as a potential solution to a pressing societal problem.
 x x x There is no doubt that 
preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal
. x x x
[36]
 (Emphases supplied, citations omitted) 




 While, as recognized above, "preventing danger to the community 
is a legitimate regulatory goal," an accused's right to life borne from 
critical subhuman conditions cannot be just sacrificed at the altar of 
police power if there are 
practicable alternative solutions
 to 
both ensure his or her continued detention, as well as his or her 
survival. Again, preventive imprisonment is not yet a penalty. To let an
 accused perish in jail because of
 the
 
deliberate indifference of the State

 towards his or her medical conditions is even worse than a penalty 
because he or she has been effectively sentenced to death absent a final
 determination of his or her guilt. Surely, there must be some form of 
judicial relief to, at the very least, balance these various interests. 
    
 The 
deliberate indifference standard
 is based on 
jurisprudence from the United States, where we have patterned the Bill 
of Rights of our own Constitution. As rationalized by SCOTUS, "when the 
State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his 
will, [as in the case of prisoners,] the Constitution imposes upon it a 
corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and 
general well-being."
[37]
 In the case of 
Estelle v. Gamble
 (
Estelle
),
[38]

 the SCOTUS, however, qualified that it is the State's "deliberate 
indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners [which] constitutes 
the 'unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' x x x proscribed by the 
Eighth Amendment." In 
Estelle
, it was held: 
    


 
We therefore conclude that 
deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners
 constitutes the "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain," 
x x x 
proscribed
 by the Eighth Amendment. This is true whether the indifference is 
manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs
 x x x 
or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care
 x x x 
or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.
 x x x 
Regardless
 of how evidenced, deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious 
illness or injury states a cause of action under Â§ 1983.


 x x x x


 x x x [
I
]
n the medical context, an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care cannot be said to constitute
 "
an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain
" 
or to be
 x x x "
repugnant to the conscience of mankind.
"
 Thus, a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or 
treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical 
mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not 
become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a 
prisoner. 
In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must 
allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate 
indifference to serious medical needs. It is only such indifference that
 can offend "evolving standards of decency" in violation of the Eighth 
Amendment
. x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied, citations omitted) 




 Since the SCOTUS's promulgation of 
Estelle
, the 
"deliberate indifference" standard has been used in succeeding cases in 
order to determine whether or not a supposed inadequacy in medical care 
received by an inmate may constitute a violation of the Eighth 
Amendment.
[39]
 This standard was further refined in 
Helling v. McKinney
[40]
 (
Helling
),
 wherein the SCOTUS introduced two (2) elements that may help in 
determining whether there exists such violation, namely the objective 
and subjective factors. The existence of these factors must be proven 
with evidence showing that: (a) the prisoner was deprived of a basic 
human need or that he or she had an objectively serious medical 
condition (
objective factor
); and (b) the prison officials knew 
about the prisoner's need or condition, which they consciously 
disregarded by actions beyond mere negligence (
subjective factor
).
[41]


 To clarify, the 
objective factor 
should involve a determination of 
whether
 or not the inmate is exposed to a risk which seriously and critically 
threatens his or her right to life while incarcerated
. As stated in 
Helling
,
 such determination requires more than a scientific and statistical 
inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood 
that such injury to health will actually be caused by the inmate's 
exposure to such risk. It also requires the court to assess whether 
society considers the risk that the inmate complains of to be so grave 
that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone 
unwillingly to such a risk. In other words, the prisoner must show that 
the risk of which he or she complains of is not one that today's society
 chooses to tolerate.
[42]


 On the other hand, the 
subjective factor 
should involve an inquiry of the prison authorities' attitude and conduct in dealing with the risk complained of by the inmate, 
i.e.
,
 whether or not such attitude and conduct are tainted with deliberate 
indifference to the serious medical needs of the inmate. On this note, 
further US case law suggests that the existence of "deliberate 
indifference" on the part of prison authorities involves a 
"state-of-mind" inquiry on their part.
[43]

 Such deliberate indifference "can be evidenced by 'repeated examples of
 negligent acts which disclose a pattern of conduct by the prison 
medical staff or it can be demonstrated by '
proving that there are 
such systematic and gross deficiencies in staffing, facilities, 
equipment, or procedures that the inmate population is effectively 
denied access to adequate medical care
."
[44]


 
While the relief portion of the instant petition prays 
for petitioners' temporary release on recognizance or in the 
alternative, bail, petitioners also ask this Court that they be released
 through "other non-custodial measures
,"
[45]

 asserting their right to life, and not to be subjected to cruel and 
unusual punishment based on the Bill of Rights of our Constitution. As 
implied by the 
ponencia
's disposition, the Court has not turned a blind eye away from these pleas that are, after all, founded on our fundamental law. 
Thus,
 similar to the referral of petitioners' applications for 
bail/recognizance, the Court has adopted the proposal to instead, treat 
the instant petition as petitioners' motions for suitable but 
practicable confinement arrangements. In my own view, I submit that 
these motions should be adjudged according to the above-mentioned 
parameters of deliberate indifference.


 Nonetheless, it must be highlighted that in the same way 
that the Court is unequipped to make a factual determination on whether 
or not the evidence of guilt against any of the petitioners is strong, 
it is equally unequipped to make a factual determination of whether or 
not the State has breached the "deliberate indifference" standard with 
respect to the confinement conditions of each petitioner. 
The jail 
conditions of each petitioner vis-Ã -vis their own medical status are 
distinct from one another and cannot be sweepingly assumed without the 
benefit of a dedicated proceeding for the purpose.
 Hence, the Court 
cannot just yet grant petitioners any form of temporary release outside 
the traditional modes of bail or recognizance, without the benefit of a 
full-blown hearing therefor. As earlier intimated, the petition must 
therefore be referred to the respective trial courts in order for them 
to ascertain the peculiarities of each petitioner's situation and assess
 the same in accordance with the parameters stated above. Once it is 
determined that there exists a "deliberate indifference" on the part of 
the State, these courts may then accord the accused confinement 
arrangements that are logistically practicable under the given situation
 (
e.g.
, transfers to other detention facilities, directive to 
minimize capacity in the accused's jail, isolation, etc.), taking into 
account not only the side of the accused but also the submissions of the
 State, in particular, the prison officials in charge of the custody of 
the accused. This is clearly warranted, considering the averments of 
respondents that the BuCor and the BJMP have implemented various health 
policies, protocols, and measures to ensure that they will be able to 
take care of their inmates should the latter catch COVID-19, and that 
the Court, through Office of the Court Administrator Circular No. 
91-2020
[46]
 in relation to A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC,
[47]

 has already provided guidelines towards decongesting penal facilities 
and humanizing conditions of PDLs pending hearing of their cases.
[48]

 Notably, the accused may choose to assail the ruling of the trial 
courts on this score, as well as on their respective bail applications 
should they be dissatisfied, although the same must be coursed through 
the proper proceeding in accordance with our rules of procedure.
    
 
III. Prayer for the Creation of a Prisoner Release Committee.


 Petitioners also pray for the creation of a Prisoner Release Committee
[49]

 which would be tasked to urgently study and implement the release of 
all other prisoners. However, it is beyond the power of the Court to 
institute policies that are 
not judicial in nature
. Unlike the 
reliefs discussed above that entail (1) the relaxation of procedural 
rules and (2) the enforcement of the Bill of Rights, this measure is 
tantamount to a directive that squarely interferes with 
institutional administration
, which the Court cannot do. There is simply 
no legal or equitable basis

 for the Court to dictate the establishment of an administrative body 
that will study and implement the release of all other prisoners. While 
the Court understands the plight of petitioners in light of this 
unprecedented public health emergency, the creation of a similar 
Prisoner Release Committee is a policy matter best left to the 
discretion of the political branches of government.
    
 The other permissible reliefs discussed above are, however, 
herein accorded in order to assuage petitioners' health concerns, 
subject to the trial courts' determinations through the proper findings 
of fact for the purpose.

 In 
De la Rama v. People's Court

 [77 Phil 461, 465-466 (1946)], therein petitioner was afflicted with, 
among others, active pulmonary tuberculosis, an ailment which was, at 
that time, still had no known cure. In granting bail, the Court held: 
    


 Considering the report of the Medical Director of the Quezon 
Institute to the effect that the petitioner "is actually suffering from 
minimal, early, unstable type of pulmonary tuberculosis, and chronic, 
granular pharyngitis," and that in said institute they "have seen many 
similar cases, latter progressing into advance stages when treatment and
 medicine are no longer of any avail;" taking into consideration that 
the petitioner's previous petition for bail was denied by the People's 
Court on the ground that the petitioner was suffering from quiescent and
 not active tuberculosis, and the implied purpose of the People's Court 
in sending the petitioner to the Quezon Institute for clinical 
examination and diagnosis of the actual condition of his lungs, was 
evidently to verify whether the petitioner is suffering from active 
tuberculosis, in order to act accordingly in deciding his petition for 
bail; and considering further that the said People's Court has adopted 
and applied the well-established doctrine cited in our above-quoted 
resolution in several cases, among them, the cases against Pio Duran 
(case No. 3324) and Benigno Aquino (case No. 3527), in which the said 
defendants were released on bail on the ground that they were ill and 
their continued confinement in New Bilibid Prison would be injurious to 
their health or endanger their life; it is evident and we consequently 
hold that the People's Court acted with grave abuse of discretion in 
refusing to release the petitioner on bail.

SEPARATE OPINION


 
LEONEN, 
J
.:




 Our country's perennial jail congestion has made persons 
deprived of liberty all the more vulnerable to the most virulent of 
infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Thus, in view of the Petition's
 factual assertions and broad arguments, I concur with the unanimous 
decision of this Court to refer this case to the trial courts to 
determine, upon the parties' proper motion or petition, whether there 
are factual bases to support their temporary release. 
      
 Nonetheless, consistent with our constitutional duty to 
recognize the intrinsic value of every human being, as well as our power
 to provide guidance to the Bench and Bar, we should clarify the 
following: 
      
 First, the traditional mode of securing the release of any
 accused on trial or on appeal is through bail or recognizance. As Chief
 Justice Diosdado Peralta (Chief Justice Peralta) said, trial courts 
should conscientiously and consistently implement all of this Court's 
applicable guidelines on fixing the amount of bail to plea bargaining.
[1]
 I reiterate my opinion in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
[2]

 that a release on bail or recognizance should comply with the 
Constitution, laws, and rules and regulations. Any release contrary to 
these cannot be countenanced. Thus, in seeking release on bail or 
recognizance, petitioners should go to the trial courts to determine the
 facts that would entitle them to the relief. 
      
 Second, persons deprived of liberty should be able to file
 an action for violations of their constitutional right against cruel, 
inhuman, and degrading punishment, and their rights to life, health, and
 security. As proposed by Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe
 (Justice Perlas-Bernabe), we should not diminish the possibility that 
they may avail of these rights.
[3]

 This Court is not powerless to ensure that these fundamental rights are
 respected and implemented. It is why this Court exists. This aspect of 
judicial review, to measure the constitutionality of a government act or
 inaction vis-a-vis a legal right, is even more established than the 
expanded jurisdiction now contained in Article VIII, Section 1 of the 
1987 Constitution. 
      
 Thus, I opine that Article III, Section 19 of the Bill of 
Rights, which addresses the conditions of detention and service of 
sentence, may be invoked by a detainee or a convict through either mode:
 (1) a motion for release when the case is still on trial or on appeal; 
or (2) a petition for habeas corpus as a post-conviction remedy, 
consistent with 
Gumabon v. Director of Prisons
.
[4]


 Nonetheless, mere invocation of the violation of 
constitutional rights is not enough for the courts to afford relief. One
 must allege and provide factual basis showing: (a) the existing 
inhuman, degrading, or cruel conditions not organic or consistent with 
the statutory punishment imposed; (b) the violation of a clear, 
enforceable statutory or constitutional provision, including those which
 may refer to judicially discernable international standards adopted in 
this jurisdiction; (c) a clear demand on the relevant agencies of 
government to address the grievance; and (d) the intentional or 
persistent refusal or negligence on the part of the government 
agencyâwhether the warden, director of prisons, local government unit, 
or Congressâto address the proven situation and statutory or 
constitutional provisions. 
        
 We should emphasize that all provisions in the Bill of 
Rights are justiciable. However, in deference to the other 
constitutional organs, a violation of the constitutional rights of 
persons deprived of liberty anchored on existing jail or health 
conditions should first be addressed by the executive and legislative 
branches. Thus, before a court may give due course to such a cause of 
action, there must be a showing that the movant or petitioner has made a
 clear demand on the relevant agencies, and that there has been a denial
 or unreasonable negligence on their part. 
        
 Finally, as a distinguishing initiative of the Peralta 
Court, I suggest a measure that is grounded on social justice: a writ of
 
kalayaan
. This will be similar to the writ of 
kalikasan
 
or the writ of continuing mandamus in environmental cases, but geared 
toward addressing jail congestion. It shall be issued when all the 
requirements to establish cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment are 
present. It shall also provide an order of precedence to bring the 
occupation of jails to a more humane level. Upon constant supervision by
 an executive judge, the order of release will prioritize those whose 
penalties are the lowest and whose crimes are brought about not by 
extreme malice but by the indignities of poverty. 
        
 Jail congestion affects so many individuals, most of 
them poor and invisible. The dawn of the COVID-19 pandemic has made this
 a more urgent concern. It is time that we, as the Supreme Court, 
address this through the clearest guidance to our lower courts. 
        
 Indeed, this case is unprecedented, for we are given the
 opportunity to define the limitations of the expanded executive power 
during a pandemic, as well as to address jail congestionâa longstanding 
problem that has pervaded our justice system. The issues involved here 
bear upon not only the role of the Judiciary, but also our collective 
humanity, as we adapt to the unique circumstances brought upon by the 
pandemic. 
        
 In this case, petitioners are detainees who pray for 
their temporary release on recognizance or on bail, invoking 
humanitarian considerations on account of their advanced age and 
compromised health conditions, as well as the spread of COVID-19 in 
congested jails. They ask that their release be allowed while the 
country is in the state of public health emergency, national calamity, 
lockdown, and community quarantine. They also pray for the creation of a
 "prisoner release committee" that shall issue ground rules and 
implement the release of all those similarly situated.
[5]


 With many of them sick, elderly, and pregnantâthose most
 vulnerable to the diseaseâpetitioners maintain that their continuing 
detention threatens their life and health. This, they assert, 
transgresses their right against cruel, degrading, and inhuman 
punishment under Article III, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution.
[6]


 Petitioners likewise invoke their rights under 
international law principles and conventions, including: (1) the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (2) the Convention
 Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; (3) the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules);
[7]

 (4) the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and 
Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules); and (5) 
the United Nations Principles for Older Persons.
[8]


 Petitioners also point out that the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights has recommended the decongestion of jails 
by releasing the most vulnerable prisoners. They point out how the 
governments of Ethiopia, Sudan, Germany, Canada, India, Iran, 
Afghanistan, Turkey, Australia, and New Jersey in the United States have
 begun releasing prisoners upon acknowledging the gravity of the 
pandemic.
[9]


 As such, petitioners pray that this Court apply equity 
in their situation. They assert that their release will not prejudice 
the State or the prosecution, and will lessen state costs and health 
risks to jail personnel. They insist that they are not flight risks, 
citing the quarantine and their advanced age, physical conditions, and 
lack of resources to avoid trial.
[10]
 They further point out that they are not hardened criminals, as the charges against them are due to political beliefs.
[11]
 They likewise stress that they have not yet been convicted, and are thus presumed innocent.
[12]


 Furthermore, petitioners cite the Implementing Rules and
 Regulations of Republic Act No. 10575, which states that this Court may
 order the release or transfer of any inmate, especially if not yet 
convicted.
[13]


 Petitioners maintain prisoners' vulnerability to COVID-19.
[14]
 They point out that social distancing is impossible in jails, with some housing up to 534% capacity.
[15]
 They assert that the national government has not provided adequate health measures in detention facilities.
[16]
 While recognizing some measures set up in jails, they insist that these are not sufficient to prevent the disease's spread.
[17]
 They also raise mental health issues, their contact with the outside world having been more limited.
[18]


 Finally, petitioners assert that this Court has allowed bail on humanitarian grounds in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
[19]
 and 
Dela Rama v. People
,
[20]
 after accounting for the petitioners' health conditions.
[21]


 In an April 17, 2020 Resolution, this Court required 
respondents to submit their comment and their verified reports on the 
necessary interim preventive measures in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
        
 For their part, respondents pray that the Petition be 
outright dismissed for petitioners' failure to comply with the doctrine 
of hierarchy of courts. They maintain that petitioners should have gone 
to the court where their criminal cases are pending.
[22]

 Moreover, respondents argue that the Petition raises questions of facts
 which only the lower courts may determine. Humanitarian grounds and the
 COVID-19 pandemic are allegedly not compelling reasons to seek direct 
recourse to this Court.
[23]


 Respondents also claim that petitioners cannot be 
temporarily released on recognizance or on bail. They say recognizance 
cannot be granted as petitioners have all been charged with offenses 
punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
.
[24]

 Specifically, petitioners are allegedly members of the Communist Party 
of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front 
(CPP-NPA-NDF), which has been identified as a terrorist organization in 
2017.
[25]
 As to bail, 
respondents point out that it is a matter of discretion which requires 
notice and hearing, in line with due process.
[26]


 Respondents maintain that petitioners cannot rely on 
Enrile
 because it is a 
pro hac vice

 ruling. It does not apply to petitioners who are all high-ranking 
leaders of CPP-NPA-NDF, a terrorist organization. Moreover, since 
petitioners had previously violated the terms of their provisional 
release, respondents say they are flight risks and not entitled to 
temporary release.
[27]


 Respondents assert that petitioners invoke preferential 
treatment. They claim that granting the Petition will violate the equal 
protection clause, there being no substantial difference between 
petitioners and the other prisoners who are also languishing in jail 
despite the threat of COVID-19.
[28]

 They characterize the Petition as a tool of deception used by the 
CPP-NPA-NDF by taking advantage of the pandemic to justify the release 
of its high-profile members.
[29]


 Finally, respondents allege that the government has 
taken several health and protection measures to ensure the safety of 
persons deprived of liberty.
[30]
 They assert that the Philippines is not required to follow suit with foreign governments.
[31]
 The provisions on release of prisoners and prison congestion, they maintain, is not one of the grounds for release.
[32]


 In reply, petitioners justify their direct recourse to 
this Court because of the novel question of law brought about by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. While they admit that their medical conditions are 
questions of fact, they maintain that this Court may resolve the 
legality of releasing the elderly, sickly, and those in critical 
conditions based on humanitarian considerations.
[33]

 They allege that this Court, exercising its equity jurisdiction, may 
grant their provisional release because of the lack of speedy and 
adequate remedies in the lower courts, as with the ravaging effects of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in highly congested jail systems.
[34]


 Petitioners argue that a substantial distinction exists 
for this Court to allow them provisional liberty because of their status
 as detainees yet to be convicted, their advanced ages, and existing 
medical conditions. They plead that such classification of detainees be 
applied to others similarly situated who must also be allowed temporary 
release for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[35]


 Petitioners claim that respondents failed to curtail the
 spread of COVID-19 in several of its institutions, as the issue of 
physical distancing, a key measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in 
prisons, remains unaddressed. Petitioners pray for this Court to take 
judicial notice of the overcrowding and subhuman conditions in 
correctional facilities in the Philippines, and to rule that prison 
systems are not equipped with medical and health care facilities to 
address the COVID-19 pandemic.
[36]


 I join this Court in referring this matter to the 
appropriate trial courts, which will determine whether there are factual
 bases to support petitioners' temporary release. In the trial courts, 
petitioners may pray for their provisional release by: (a) applying for 
bail or recognizance; or (b) filing an action for a violation of their 
constitutional rights.
[37]


 
I


 The traditional mode of securing provisional release of an accused pending trial or appeal is through bail or recognizance. 
        
 Article III, Section 13 of the 1987 Constitution provides: 
        
 SECTION 13. All persons, except those charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua

 when evidence of guilt is strong, shall, before conviction, be bailable
 by sufficient sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be 
provided by law. The right to bail shall not be impaired even when the 
privilege of the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is suspended. Excessive bail shall not be required. 

        Under the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, bail is the 
security given by or on behalf of a person in custody so that they may 
be provisionally released. It is meant to ensure their appearance before
 any court.
[38]


 Generally, all persons are entitled to the right to be released on bail.
[39]
 However, the grant of bail is subject to several conditions,
[40]
 requirements,
[41]
 procedures,
[42]
 and qualifications.
[43]
 Likewise, there are circumstances when release on bail shall not be granted.
[44]


 In 
People v. Escobar
,
[45] 
this Court explained that the right to bail is premised on the presumption of innocence: 
        


 Bail is the security given for the temporary release of a person who has been arrested and detained but "whose guilt has
 not

 yet been proven" in court beyond reasonable doubt. The right to bail is
 cognate to the fundamental right to be presumed innocent. In 
People v. Fitzgerald
: 




 The right to bail emanates from the [accused's 
constitutional] right to be presumed innocent. It is accorded to a 
person in the custody of the law who may, by reason of the presumption 
of innocence he [or she] enjoys, be allowed provisional liberty upon 
filing of a security to guarantee his [or her] appearance before any 
court, as required under specified conditions. . . . (Citations omitted)
 




 Bail may be a matter of right or judicial discretion. The 
accused has the right to bail if the offense charged is "not punishable 
by death, 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment" before 
conviction by the Regional Trial Court. However, if the accused is 
charged with an offense the penalty of which is death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment â "regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution'" â 
and 
when evidence of one's guilt is not strong, then the accused's prayer for bail is subject to the discretion of the trial court.
[46]
 (Citations omitted) 




 There are instances when posting bail is no longer required,
 but these must be provided in the law or in the Rules of Court. Rule 
114, Section 16 of the Rules of Court provides such instances:  
        
 When a person has been in custody for a period 
equal to or more than the possible maximum imprisonment prescribed for 
the offense charged, he shall be released immediately, without prejudice
 to the continuation of the trial or the proceedings on appeal. If the 
maximum penalty to which the accused may be sentenced is 
destierro
, he shall be released after thirty (30) days of preventive imprisonment.
            
 A person in custody for a period equal to or more than 
the minimum of the principal penalty prescribed for the offense charged,
 without application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law or any modifying 
circumstance, shall be released on a reduced bail or on his own 
recognizance, at the discretion of the court. (16a)          
        

        In 2014, this Court, through A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC, issued 
guidelines to enforce the accused's rights to bail and speedy trial to 
decongest holding jails and to humanize the conditions of detainees.
[47]
 Section 5 provides:
        
 SECTION 5. 
Release After Service of Minimum Imposable Penalty
.
 â The accused who has been detained for a period at least equal to the 
minimum of the penalty for the offense charged against him shall be 
ordered released, motu proprio or on motion and after notice and 
hearing, on his own recognizance without prejudice to the continuation 
of the proceedings against him. [Sec. 16, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court
 and Sec. 5(b) of R.A. 10389] 

        Meanwhile, release on recognizance is generally allowed if it is provided by law or the Rules of Court.
[48]
 Rule 114, Section 15 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure states:
        


 SECTION 15. 
Recognizance
. â Whenever allowed by law
 or these Rules, the court may release a person in custody on his own 
recognizance or that of a responsible person.




 In 
People v. Abner
,
[49]

 this Court defined recognizance as a record entered in court allowing 
for the release of an accused subject to the condition that they will 
appear for trial: 




Section 1, Rule 110, of the Rules of Court, provides that 
"bail is the security required and given for the release of a person who
 is in the custody of the law, that he will appear before any court in 
which his appearance may be required as stipulated in the bail bond or 
recognizance." Under this, there are two methods of taking bail: (1) by 
bail bond and (2) by recognizance. A bail bond is an obligation given by
 the accused with one or more sureties, with the condition to be void 
upon the performance by the accused of such acts as he may legally be 
required to perform. 
A recognizance is an obligation of record, 
entered into before some court or magistrate duly authorized to lake it,
 with the condition to do some particular act, the most usual condition 
in criminal cases being the appearance of the accused for trial
. (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 2d ed., Vol. II, page 592.) In 
U. S. vs. Sunico et al.
, 48 Phil., 826, 834, this court, citing 
Lamphire vs. State
,
 73 N. H., 462; 62 Atl., 786; 6 Am. & Eng. Ann. Cas., 615, defined a
 recognizance as "a contract between the sureties and the State for the 
production of the principal at the required time."
[50]
 (Emphasis supplied) 



        Under Republic Act No. 10389, or the Recognizance Act of 2012, 
release on recognizance is allowed if any person in custody or detention
 "is unable to post bail due to abject poverty."
[51]
 It is a matter of right when the offense is not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment, so long as the application is timely filed.
[52]


 Republic Act No. 10389 further enumerates the procedure, requirements, and disqualifications for release on recognizance.
[53]


 In 
Espiritu v. Jovellanos
,
[54] 
this
 Court enumerated the instances when release on recognizance is allowed 
under Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure: 
        
 Under Rule 114, Â§15 of the Rules of Court, the 
release on recognizance of any person under detention may be ordered 
only by a court and only in the following cases: (a) when the offense 
charged is for violation of an ordinance, a light felony, or a criminal 
offense, the imposable penalty for which does not exceed 6 months 
imprisonment and/or P2,000 fine, under the circumstances provided in 
R.A. No. 6036; (b) where a person has been in custody for a period equal
 to or more than the minimum of the imposable principal penalty, without
 application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law or any modifying 
circumstance, in which case the court, in its discretion, may allow his 
release on his own recognizance; (c) where the accused has applied for 
probation, pending resolution of the case but no bail was filed or the 
accused is incapable of filing one; and (d) in case of a youthful 
offender held for physical and mental examination, trial, or appeal, if 
he is unable to furnish bail and under the circumstances envisaged in 
P.D. No. 603, as amended (Art. 191).
[55]
 (Citation omitted) 

        The other modes of release are reflected in the Bureau of Corrections Operating Manual, which provides the following:
        


 SECTION 1.
 Basis for Release of an Inmate
. â An inmate may be released from prison: 


 upon the expiration of his sentence;
 by order of the Court or of competent authority; or 
 after being granted parole, pardon or amnesty. 


 SECTION 2. 
Who May Authorize Release.
 â The following are authorized to order or approve the release of inmates: 


 the Supreme Court or lower courts, in cases of acquittal or grant of bail;
 the President of the Philippines, in cases of executive clemency or amnesty; 
 the Board of Pardons and Parole, in parole cases; and 
the Director, upon the expiration of the sentence of the inmate. 




 Similarly, the Revised Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology Comprehensive Operations Manual provides the modes and 
guidelines for the release of inmates. Section 31 states in part: 
        


 SECTION 31. 
Modes and Guidelines for Release
. â The following modes and guidelines shall be observed when inmates are to be released from detention: 




 1. An inmate may be released through: 


 Service of sentence; 
Order of the Court;
 Parole;
Pardon; and 
Amnesty. 


 . . . . 


 3. No inmate shall be released on a mere verbal order or
 an order relayed via telephone. The release of an inmate by reason of 
acquittal, dismissal of case, payment of fines and/or indemnity, or 
filing of bond, shall take effect only upon receipt of the release order
 served by the court process server. The court order shall bear the full
 name of the inmate, the crime he/she was charged with, the criminal 
case number and such other details that will enable the officer in 
charge to properly identify the inmate to be released; 


 4. Upon proper verification from the court of the 
authenticity of the order, an inmate shall be released promptly and 
without unreasonable delay. 






 Incidentally, alternative custodial arrangements are in 
place for specific instances. Case in point, temporary leave from jail 
for serious illness is allowed; however, this leave is 
not
 a release on bail, but a hospitalization leave that requires court approval: 
        


 SECTION 65. 
Leave from Jail
. â Leave from jail shall be allowed in very meritorious cases, like the following: 




 1. Death or serious illness of spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, or children. 


 2. Inmates who are seriously ill or injured may, under 
proper escort, be allowed hospitalization leave or medical attendance. 
However, such leave shall require prior approval of the Courts having 
jurisdiction over them; 


 Provided, however, that in life and death cases where 
immediate medical attention is imperative, the warden, at his/her own 
discretion, may allow an inmate to be hospitalized or moved out of jail 
for medical treatment; Provided further, that when the emergency has 
ceased as certified by the attending physician, the warden shall cause 
the inmate's immediate transfer back to the jail, except when there is a
 court order directing him to continue the inmates confinement in a 
hospital until his/her recovery or upon order of the Court for his/her 
immediate return to the jail.
[56]
 






 In 
Trillanes v. Pimentel,
[57]

 this Court acknowledged that prisoners may be granted temporary leaves 
from imprisonment upon a court order. However, a prisoner must first 
establish an emergency or compelling reason. 
        
 Here, petitioners pray for their temporary release on 
recognizance or on bail, invoking humanitarian considerations and this 
Court's exercise of its equity jurisdiction, on account of their 
advanced age, compromised health conditions, the nature of COVID-19, and
 our current jail conditions. 
        
 However, there are no legal provisions that provide for 
the release of detainees based on humanitarian grounds. Neither does the
 Constitution nor any statute allow for the automatic grant of bail or 
release on recognizance for inmates who are of vulnerable health. 
        
 Petitioners know this. They themselves concede that humanitarian considerations are 
not
 grounds for bail.
[58]
 This is precisely why they invoke this Court's discretion on the ground of compassion,
[59]
 filing their Petition as an exception to the rules on bail or recognizance.
[60]
 They pray that this Court exercise its equity jurisdiction on account of a gap in the law that it can legitimately remedy.
[61]
 Petitioners rely on 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
,
[62]
 where the majority of this Court allowed the petitioner's bail for humanitarian considerations.
[63]


 In his opinion, Justice Delos Santos points out that 
courts cannot grant reliefs, invent remedies, or recognize implied 
rights without a law providing for it.
[64]

 He holds that to allow petitioners' release will intrude into the 
powers of the legislature, and is contrary to the civil law tradition of
 deciding cases based on express provisions of law.
        
 He and Justice Jose Reyes, Jr. (Justice Reyes) both 
opine that this Court cannot grant the release of petitioners on the 
ground of equity, especially if it contravenes law. They add that the 
case presents several questions of facts that must be lodged with the 
trial courts. To allow the automatic release of detainees on a single 
factor, without evaluating other factors, will create a substantive 
right and predetermine an entitlement to a provisional liberty, which 
courts have no power to do.
[65]
 Justice Reyes also notes that petitioners' allegations are not sufficient to justify a direct recourse to this Court.
[66]


 I agree with my colleagues that this Court cannot 
exercise its equity jurisdiction to supplant the express provisions on 
bail and recognizance. 
        
 A court's exercise of equity jurisdiction often comes 
into play when special circumstances reveal an inflexibility in its 
statutory or legal jurisdiction, or an inadequacy in available laws, 
such that it is unable to render substantive justice. In 
Reyes v. Lim
:
[67]


 Equity jurisdiction aims to do complete justice
 in cases where a court of law is unable to adapt its judgments to the 
special circumstances of a case because of the inflexibility of its 
statutory or legal jurisdiction. Equity is the principle by which 
substantial justice may be attained in cases where the prescribed or 
customary forms of ordinary law are inadequate.
[68]
 (Citations omitted) 

        Equity jurisdiction finds basis in Article 9 of the Civil Code, 
which states that "[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment 
by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws."
[69]
 Essentially, equity "fills the open spaces in the law."
[70]


 This Court's equity jurisdiction has been exercised in cases
 where the absence or insufficiency of an express provision or 
procedural rule will result in unjust enrichment or prevent rightful 
restitution.
[71]
 It has also 
been applied where a strict application of procedural rules will 
overrule "strong considerations of substantial justice[.]"
[72]
 In 
Orata v. Intermediate Appellate Court
,
[73]
 this Court held: 
        
 Be that as it may, this Court has in a number 
of cases, in the exercise of equity jurisdiction decided to disregard 
technicalities in order to resolve the case on its merits based on the 
evidence.
            
 Furthermore, it is well settled that litigations should,
 as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on 
technicalities; that every party-litigant must be afforded the amplest 
opportunity for the proper and just determination of his case, free from
 unacceptable plea of technicalities. This Court has ruled further that 
being a few days late in the filing of the petition for review does not 
merit automatic dismissal thereof. And even assuming that a petition for
 review is filed a few days late, where strong considerations of 
substantial justice are manifest in the petition, this Court may relax 
the stringent application of technical rules in the exercise of its 
equity jurisdiction. In addition to the basic merits of the main case, 
such a petition usually embodies justifying circumstances which warrant 
Our heeding the petitioner's cry for justice, inspite of the earlier 
negligence of counsel.
[74]
 (Citations omitted)         
        

        However, this Court has repeatedly clarified that equity only applies when there is an 
absence
 in the law. It cannot overrule, infringe, or disregard express provisions of law. In 
Heirs of Soriano v. Court of Appeals
:
[75]


 As often held by this Court, equity is available 
only in the absence of law and not as its replacement. All abstract 
arguments based only on equity should yield to positive rules, (judicial
 rules of procedure) which pre-empt and prevail over such persuasions. 
Moreover, a court acting without jurisdiction cannot justify its 
assumption thereof by invoking its equity jurisdiction.
[76]
 (Citations omitted) 

        In 
Samedra v. Court of Appeals
:
[77]


 This Court, while aware of its equity jurisdiction,
 is first and foremost, a court of law. Hence, while equity might tilt 
on the side of the petitioners, the same cannot be enforced so as to 
overrule a positive provision of law in favor of private respondents.
[78]
 

        In 
Antioquia Development Corporation v. Rabacal
:
[79]


 We stress that equity, which has been aptly 
described as "justice outside legality," is applied only in the absence 
of, and never against, statutory law or judicial rules of procedure. 
Positive rules prevail over all abstract arguments based on equity 
contra legem
. For all its conceded merit, equity is available only in the absence of law and not as its replacement. . .
[80]
 (Citations omitted) 

        The law has positive provisions on bail and recognizance. This 
Court cannot supplant such provisions on the sole basis of its equity 
jurisdiction. These grounds, processes, and requirements are provided 
under the Constitution, laws, and Rules of Court, and must still earn 
respect.
        
 This is precisely why I dissented in 
Enrile
. 
        
 
I (A) 


 Justice Delos Santos holds that 
Enrile
 does not 
apply here because petitioners are charged with heinous crimes related 
to national security and are also members of the CPP-NPA-NDF and its 
affiliates.
[81]
 He notes of a 
possibility of endangering the community: a person with deteriorating 
health may still conspire to commit rebellion, and given modern 
technology, strategize anti-government measures or give aid to active 
comrades by providing intelligence reports.
[82]


 To Justice Delos Santos, unlike in 
Enrile
, petitioners here failed to show that they filed their respective bail applications,
[83]

 leaving this Court with no way of knowing whether the evidence of guilt
 is strong. He points out that petitioners likewise did not provide the 
pertinent information such as the crimes against them, the status of 
their cases, or medical records, among others.
[84]
 In any case, he maintains that the determination of such information should still be lodged with the trial courts.
[85]


 Chief Justice Peralta states that petitioners cannot rely on 
Enrile 
because they have not filed their respective motions for bail in the lower courts.
[86]

 Further, this Court cannot take judicial notice of their respective 
health and medical conditions. Finally, he opines that the petitioner in
 
Enrile
 has proven that he was neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk. 
        
 I agree that 
Enrile
 does not apply in this case. However, my reasons differ from those of Chief Justice Peralta and Justice Delos Santos. 
        
 In 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
,
[87] 
the petitioner, then Senator Juan Ponce Enrile (Enrile), was charged with plunder, punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
 Later, when a warrant for his arrest was served, he proceeded to the 
Criminal Investigation and Detection Group of the Philippine National 
Police and filed a Motion to Fix Bail. He asserted that his voluntary 
surrender and age were extenuating circumstances that would lower the 
imposable penalty to 
reclusion temporal
. He also argued that he was not a flight risk because of his age and physical condition. 
        
 While his Motion was pending, Enrile filed a Motion for 
Detention at the Philippine National Police General Hospital or in 
another medical facility, "arguing that 'his advanced age and frail 
medical condition' merited hospital arrest."
[88]

 This was granted until further orders from the Sandiganbayan. Later, 
the Sandiganbayan denied Enrile's Motion to Fix Bail for being 
premature, stating that he has not applied for bail and, thus, no bail 
hearing had been had. 
        
 When the case was brought to this Court, the majority 
allowed Enrile to post bail on account of his fragile health and 
advanced age. I dissented, for several reasons. 
        
 First, the laws, rules, and doctrines on bail clearly require a hearing.
[89]
 Contrary to Chief Justice Peralta's opinion, there was no bail hearing in 
Enrile
.
 As aptly pointed out by Justice Perlas-Bernabe, the absence of a bail 
hearing was precisely why the Sandiganbayan rejected the Motion to Fix 
Bail for being premature.
[90]


 Furthermore, I opined that medical conditions requiring 
special treatment should be pleaded and heard in the bail hearing, 
because: (1) these are questions of fact which must be proven and 
authenticated; and (2) the prosecution should have the right to due 
process by being given an opportunity to rebut or verify the 
allegations. In that case, Enrile's medical condition, or any other 
humanitarian reason, was not raised as a ground for bail in any of his 
pleadings. Yet, the majority still granted his bail by taking judicial 
notice of a doctor's certification. 
        
 Second, I opined that bail for humanitarian 
considerations is not found in the Constitution, or in any law or rule 
of procedure. There is likewise no specific international law that 
compels the release of an accused on account of his medical condition. 
        
 Thus, I discussed that the release of detainees on 
humanitarian grounds needs clear legal basis and guidelines. Otherwise, 
it will simply be based on the court's discretionâ"unpredictable, 
partial, and solely grounded on the presence or absence of human 
compassion on the day that justices of this court deliberate and vote."
[91]

 Thus, bail cannot be granted solely by invoking a human right 
principle. Constitutional rights apply to all, but it should not be 
upheld by disregarding or suspending the rule of law. 
        
 Still, Justice Lazaro-Javier asserts that the standards applied in 
Enrile
 were clear-cut. She opines that 
Enrile

 provided a two-step test to authorize the grant of discretionary bail: 
"(1) the detainee will not be a flight risk or danger to the community; 
(2) there are special, humanitarian, and compelling circumstances."
[92]


 I disagree. In fact, Enrile's release raised several 
questions that reveal the lack of clear guidelines: Is his release 
because of his advanced age? Is it because he suffers from medical 
conditions or because those conditions were aggravated by incarceration?
 Is it due to a medical emergency? Can the release on bail be shortened 
once the medical emergency has been addressed? What medical conditions 
allow for the release on bail? Does it apply only to those on trial for 
plunder, or to others with crimes punished by 
reclusion perpetua
 
or life imprisonment? Does it apply only to senators or those of similar
 stature? Incidentally, these are the very questions that the Petition 
now before this Court seeks to test.
        
 Third, I noted that, when hospital treatment is 
necessary, courts usually do not grant bail, but only modify the 
conditions for one's detention. The accused's release should also not be
 longer than the time needed to address the medical condition. Yet, the 
majority in 
Enrile
 granted bail even if the Sandiganbayan did not
 find Enrile suffering from a unique and debilitating disease. The 
majority even permitted him to undergo hospital arrest. 
        
 Finally, I discussed that alternative custodial 
arrangements should not favor only wealthy, powerful, and networked 
detainees. The right to liberty applies to all individuals. Special 
privileges should be granted only under clear, transparent, and reasoned
 circumstances. The majority's grant of bail was clearly a special 
accommodation for Enrile. It lacked neutrality and impartiality as it 
found a better argument for the petitioner, at the expense of the 
prosecution. 
        
 I note Chief Justice Peralta's opinion that the ruling in 
Enrile
 is not a 
pro hac vice 
ruling since 
pro hac vice
 rulings have been declared illegal in 
Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc.
[93]

 I also note Justice Lazaro-Javier's opinion that Enrile forms part of 
the law of the land as a legally binding decision, and her refusal to 
treat it as 
pro hac vice
 ruling to avoid the notion that this Court lays down doctrines that solely serve the powerful and privileged.
[94]


 I, however, join Justices Caguioa and Perlas-Bernabe in reaffirming that 
Enrile
 is a 
pro hac vice
 ruling, applicable only to the unique considerations accorded to Enrile.
[95]
 I agree that the ruling in 
Enrile
 does not support the Constitution, the rules, and jurisprudence. It is a stray decision
[96]

 that cannot be a binding precedent, because there was no hearing to 
determine whether the evidence of his guilt was not strong. 
        
 I maintain my opinion in 
Enrile
 here. Release on 
bail for humanitarian considerations or medical conditions is not found 
in the Constitution, in any local or international law, or in any rule 
of procedure. While petitioners enjoy the constitutional rights to life 
and health, these rights do not result in the automatic grant of bail 
for those who are of advanced age and frail health. 
        
 Detainees cannot be allowed temporary release without 
following the law. If petitioners or any other detainees seek to be 
released on bail, a hearing is necessary to determine the amount of 
bail. If they are charged with a crime punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment, a hearing is necessary to determine whether the evidence of guilt is strong. 
        
 Should a new ground for temporary release be allowed or 
an alternative custodial arrangement be provided, the rule must be clear
 as to who are qualified: What age? What medical conditions or health 
concerns? What crimes? For how long? In any case, the right to equal 
protection of the laws must always be kept in mind, so that no special 
privilege or accommodation would be extended to anyone else, as what 
happened in 
Enrile
. Alternative custodial arrangements should be 
granted only under clear, transparent, and reasoned circumstances. They 
must always bow to the relevant laws and rules of procedure, subject to 
continuous review by the trial court. 
        
 Thus, this Petition should be referred to the proper 
trial courts to determine whether there is basis for their release on 
bail or recognizance. Before petitioners may be released, they must 
first establish before the trial courts the facts, circumstances, and 
qualifications that will warrant their release on bail or recognizance.
        
 
I (B)


 Justices Perlas-Bernabe and Delos Santos both hold that 
there is wisdom in depriving the accused of liberty pending trial. Their
 continued detention ensures the court's jurisdiction over them, secures
 their participation in the proceedings, and prevents them from 
committing another crime.
[97]


 However, Justice Delos Santos concludes that detaining 
the criminally accused pending the determination of their guilt is part 
of police power.
[98]
 I qualify his conclusion. 
        
 The State's "capacity to prosecute and punish crimes" is part of its police power. In 
Tawahig v. Hon. Lapinid
:
[99]


 A crime is "an offense against society." It "is a breach of the security and peace of the people at large[.]"
            
 A criminal action, where "the State prosecutes a person 
for an act or omission punishable by law," is thus pursued "to maintain 
social order." It "punish[es] the offender in order to deter him [or 
her] and others from committing the same or similar offense, . . . 
isolate[s] him [or her] from society, reform[s] and rehabilitate[s] him 
[or her]." One who commits a crime commits an offense against all the 
citizens of the state penalizing a given act or omission: "a criminal 
offense is an outrage to the very sovereignty of the State[.]" 
Accordingly, a criminal action is prosecuted in the name of the "People"
 as plaintiff. Likewise, a representative of the State, the public 
prosecutor, "direct[s] and control[s] the prosecution of [an] offense." 
As such, a public prosecutor is:          
        




 [T]he representative not of an ordinary party to a
 controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern 
impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and 
whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it 
shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he [or she] 
is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the 
twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.
 




 The 
capacity to prosecute and punish crimes is an attribute of the State's police power
.
 It inheres in "the sovereign power instinctively charged by the common 
will of the members of society to look after, guard and defend the 
interests of the community, the individual and social rights and the 
liberties of every citizen and the guaranty of the exercise of his 
rights."
[100]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 

        Police power cannot justify denying a person's right to 
provisional liberty. The Constitution provides that all persons, except 
those punished with 
reclusion perpetua
 whose evidence of guilt is strong, have a right to provisional liberty.
[101]
 What justifies the accused's deprivation of liberty is the determination that the evidence of guilt is strong:
        
 In the present case, it is uncontroverted that petitioner's application for bail and for release on recognizance was denied. 
The
 determination that the evidence of guilt is strong, whether ascertained
 in a hearing of an application for bail or imported from a trial 
court's judgment of conviction, justifies the detention of an accused as
 a valid curtailment of his right to provisional liberty. 
This 
accentuates the proviso that the denial of the right to bail in such 
cases is "regardless of the stage of the criminal action." 
Such 
justification for confinement with its underlying rationale of public 
self defense applies equally to detention prisoners like petitioner or 
convicted prisoners
 appellants like Jalosjos. As the Court observed in 
Alejano v. Cabuay
,
 it is impractical to draw a line between convicted prisoners and 
pre-trial detainees for the purpose of maintaining jail security; and 
while
 pre-trial detainees do not forfeit their constitutional rights upon 
confinement, the fact of their detention makes their rights more limited
 than those of the public
. The Court was more emphatic in 
People v. Hon. Maceda
: 




 As a matter of law, when a person indicted for an offense is arrested, he is deemed placed under the custody of the law. 
He is placed in actual restraint of liberty in jail so that he may be bound to answer for the commission of the offense
.
 He must be detained in jail during the pendency of the case against him
 unless he is authorized by the court to be released on bail or on 
recognizance. Let it be stressed that all prisoners whether under 
preventive detention or serving final sentence cannot practice their 
profession nor engage in any business or occupation, or hold office, 
elective or appointive, while in detention. This is a necessary 
consequence of arrest and detention. 




 These inherent limitations, however, must be taken 
into account only to the extent that confinement restrains the power of 
locomotion or actual physical movement. It bears noting that in 
Jalosjos, which was decided 
en banc
 one month after Maceda, the 
Court recognized that the accused could somehow accomplish legislative 
results. The trial court thus correctly concluded that the presumption 
of innocence does not carry with it the full enjoyment of civil and 
political rights.
[102]
 (Emphasis supplied) 


Justice Delos Santos even advances the following parameters 
in determining whether the State's police power should be exercised 
during an emergency: 








(1)


Such encroachment shall be incidental to public safety and shall not enter the bounds of arbitrariness;






 


 






(2)


Measures pursued or concerns 
protected by the State should be reasonably related or linked to the 
attainment of its legitimate objectives consistent with general welfare;
 and






 


 






(3)


The measure undertaken or concern
 addressed for the benefit of the majority pursuant to an exercise of 
police power must not be unnecessarily oppressive on the minority.
[103]








Thus, Justice Delos Santos justifies petitioners' continued 
detention by invoking public safety. He claims that the serious nature 
of the crimes charged against them, being related to their alleged 
membership in the CPP-NPA-NDF, makes their continued confinement "a 
legitimate and vital concern of national security."
[104]


 He is ready to make a pronouncement on petitioners' 
participation as alleged key members of CPP-NPA-NDF and declare them as 
terrorists,
[105]
 albeit 
limited to determining "a reasonable link or relation between the 
assailed government measures or concerns and the legitimate objectives 
regarding general welfare in times of emergency."
[106]

 From this, he infers that petitioners' continued detention is justified
 because releasing them without bail hearings would endanger national 
security.
        
 I cannot find the reasonable link that Justice Delos 
Santos claims to exist between the continued detention of petitioners as
 alleged members of CPP-NPA-NDF and the State's objective of suppressing
 the pandemic. We cannot take judicial notice of the news reports of 
alleged armed attacks against the military and police distributing 
relief goods.
[107]
 Simply, these are not proper matters of judicial notice, whether mandatory or discretionary.
        
 Rather, as Justice Reyes notes, this Court must refrain from making conclusions on the merits of petitioners' pending cases,
[108]
 as it is premature to make pronouncements based on unverified information.
[109]

 Both he and Justice Lazaro-Javier share the opinion that petitioners' 
membership in the CPP-NP-NDF is an allegation that is still being 
litigated.
[110]


 I echo their sentiments. There being no bail hearings, the evidence of petitioners' guilt has not yet been established. 
        
 To use the nature of the alleged crimes to justify 
petitioners' continued confinement denies them not only of due process, 
but also of their right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. As 
Justice Perlas-Bernabe states, "an accused cannot just be left to perish
 and die in the midst of a devastating global pandemic, without any 
recourse whatsoever."
[111]
 National security and public safety are no blanket excuses to violate the accused's constitutional rights.
        
 Thus, without the appropriate hearing in the trial 
courts, this Court should not conclude if petitioners are entitled to 
release on bail or recognizance based on the crimes charged against 
them. 
        
 
II


 Persons deprived of liberty ought to be able to file a 
case for violations of their right against cruel, inhuman, and degrading
 punishment and other related constitutional rights. 
        
 In keeping with our constitutional duty to recognize the
 intrinsic value of every human being, as well as our power to provide 
guidance to Bench and Bar, I discuss the following causes of action 
submitted by petitioners: (1) the right against cruel, degrading, and 
inhuman punishment; (2) the right to life and health; and (3) the rights
 of prisoners and detainees under international law principles and 
conventions and our own local laws, rules, and procedures. 
        
 
II (A)


 The 1987 Constitution guards against the infliction of 
any cruel, degrading, or inhuman punishment. Its Article III, Section 19
 states:
        


 SECTION 19. (1) Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor 
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment inflicted. Neither shall death 
penalty be imposed, unless, for compelling reasons involving heinous 
crimes, the Congress hereafter provides for it. Any death penalty 
already imposed shall be reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
. 


 (2) The employment of physical, psychological, or 
degrading punishment against any prisoner or detainee or the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions 
shall be dealt with by law. 




 In 
Alejano v. Cabuay
,
[112]

 this Court defined punishment as a chastisement that causes suffering 
through harm or incapacitation that is more severe than the discomfort 
of detention:
        


 An action constitutes a punishment when (1) that action 
causes the inmate to suffer some harm or "disability," and (2) the 
purpose of the action is to punish the inmate. Punishment also requires 
that the harm or disability be significantly greater than, or be 
independent of, the inherent discomforts of confinement.
[113]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Despite a few statutes and rules promoting the 
rehabilitation of offenders, our criminal justice system is primarily 
punitive, seeking to deter and penalize felonies and crimes through 
imprisonment and fines. Thus, the Constitution does not prohibit 
retributive justice in itself. What it prohibits is cruel, degrading, or
 inhuman punishment.
        
 The previous constitutions did not include punishment 
that is "degrading or inhuman." Both the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions 
respectively read:
        


 SECTION 1 (19). Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.
[114]
 


 SECTION 21. Excessive fines shall not be imposed nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted.
[115]
 




 With the enactment of the 1987 Constitution, the words "degrading or inhuman punishment" were added to the prohibition.
        
 In 
David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal
,
[116]

 this Court discussed that interpreting the text of the Constitution 
involves reviewing how the text has evolved from its previous 
iterations. The formulation of provisions usually involves a 
reassessment of old ones in order to better address any shortcomings the
 old rules failed to account for:
        


 Interpretation grounded on textual primacy likewise looks 
into how the text has evolved. Unless completely novel, legal provisions
 are the result of the re-adoption â often with accompanying 
re-calibration â of previously existing rules. Even when seemingly 
novel, provisions are often introduced as a means of addressing the 
inadequacies and excesses of previously existing rules. 


 One may trace the historical development of text: by 
comparing its current iteration with prior counterpart provisions, 
keenly taking note of changes in syntax, along with accounting for more 
conspicuous substantive changes such as the addition and deletion of 
provisos or items in enumerations, shifting terminologies, the use of 
more emphatic or more moderate qualifiers, and the imposition of heavier
 penalties. The tension between consistency and change galvanizes 
meaning.
[117]
 




 The adding of "inhuman" and "degrading" to the prohibited 
punishment reveals that these words are meant to be treated separately 
from cruel or unusual punishment, and meant to address different 
circumstances. 
        
 In 
People v. Dionisio
,
[118]

 this Court explained that punishment is cruel and unusual when the 
penalties imposed are inhuman, barbarous, and shocking to the 
conscience: 
        


 Neither fines nor imprisonment constitute in themselves 
cruel and unusual punishment, for the constitutional stricture has been 
interpreted as referring to penalties that are inhuman and barbarous, or
 shocking to the conscience and fines or imprisonment are definitely not
 in this category. 


 Nor does mere severity constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In 
People vs. Estoista
, 93 Phil. 655, this Court ruled: 




 "It takes more than merely being harsh, excessive, out 
of proportion, or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to the 
Constitution. The fact that the punishment authorized by the statute is 
severe does not make it cruel and unusual.' Expressed in other terms, it
 has been held that to come under the ban, the punishment must be 
'flagrantly and plainly oppressive,' 'wholly disproportionate to the 
nature of the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community.' 
(Idem.) Having in mind the necessity for a radical measure and the 
public interest at stake, we do not believe that five years' confinement
 for possessing firearms, even as applied to appellant's and similar 
cases, can be said to be cruel and unusual, barbarous, or excessive to 
the extent of being shocking to public conscience. It is of interest to 
note that the validity on constitutional grounds of the Act in question 
was contested neither at the trial nor in the elaborate printed brief 
for the appellant; it was raised for the first time in the course of the
 oral argument in the Court of Appeals. It is also noteworthy, as 
possible gauge of popular and judicial reaction the duration of the 
imprisonment stipulated in the statute, that some members of the court 
at first expressed opposition to any recommendation for executive 
clemency for the appellant, believing that he deserved imprisonment 
within the prescribed range."
[119]
 (Citations omitted) 






 In 
Maturan v. Commission on Elections
,
[120]

 this Court reiterated that it is the punishment's character, not its 
severity, that makes it cruel and inhuman. It would have to be an 
infliction of "corporeal or psychological punishment that strips the 
individual of [their] humanity":
        


 We have already settled that the constitutional 
proscription under the Bill of Rights extends only to situations of 
extreme corporeal or psychological punishment that strips the individual
 of his humanity. The proscription is aimed more at the form or 
character of the punishment rather than at its severity, as the Court 
has elucidated in 
Lim v. People
, to wit: 




 Settled is the rule that a punishment authorized by 
statute is not cruel, degrading or disproportionate to the nature of the
 offense unless it is flagrantly and plainly oppressive and wholly 
disproportionate to the nature of the offense as to shock the moral 
sense of the community. 
It takes more than merely being harsh, 
excessive, out of proportion or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to 
the Constitution. 
Based on this principle, the Court has 
consistently overruled contentions of the defense that the penalty of 
fine or imprisonment authorized by the statute involved is cruel and 
degrading. 


 In 
People vs. Tongko
, this Court held that 
the
 prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is generally aimed at 
the form or character of the punishment rather than its severity in 
respect of its duration or amount, and applies to punishments which 
never existed in America or which public sentiment regards as cruel or 
obsolete. This refers, for instance, to those inflicted at the whipping 
post or in the pillory, to burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, 
disemboweling and the like. The fact that the penalty is severe provides
 insufficient basis to declare a law unconstitutional and does not, by 
that circumstance alone, make it cruel and inhuman.
[121]

 The constitutional right thus necessarily ensures that all 
persons are protected against all forms of torture. Republic Act No. 
9745,
[122]
 otherwise known as 
the Anti-Torture Act, outlines what constitutes torture and other types 
of cruel and degrading treatment or punishment:
        


 SECTION 3. 
Definitions.
 â For purposes of this Act, the following terms shall mean: 




 (a) "Torture" refers to an act by which severe pain or 
suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a 
person for such purposes as obtaining from him/her or a third person 
information or a confession; punishing him/her for an act he/she or a 
third person has committed or is suspected of having committed; or 
intimidating or coercing him/her or a third person; or for any reason 
based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is 
inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or 
acquiescence of a person in authority or agent of a person in authority.
 It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or
 incidental to lawful sanctions. 


 (b) "Other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment" refers to a deliberate and aggravated treatment or 
punishment not enumerated under Section 4 of this Act, inflicted by a 
person in authority or agent of a person in authority against a person 
under his/her custody, which attains a level of severity causing 
suffering, gross humiliation or debasement to the latter.
[123]
 


 . . . . 




 SECTION 4. 
Acts of Torture
. â For purposes of this Act, torture shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

Other analogous acts of mental/psychological torture.










SECTION 5. 
Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment
.
 â Other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment refers to a
 deliberate and aggravated treatment or punishment not enumerated under 
Section 4 of this Act, inflicted by a person in authority or agent of a 
person in authority against another person in custody, which attains a 
level of severity sufficient to cause suffering, gross humiliation or 
debasement to the latter. The assessment of the level of severity shall 
depend on all the circumstances of the case, including the duration of 
the treatment or punishment, its physical and mental effects and, in 
some cases, the sex, religion, age and state of health of the victim.
[124]




 Cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment involves causing 
suffering, gross humiliation, or debasement to a person in custody. 
Torture, on the other hand, generally involves intentionally causing 
severe mental or physical agony for a specific purpose or for any reason
 based on discrimination. 
        
 The right against torture and cruel, inhuman, and 
degrading punishment is absolute. It is protected in all casesâeven in 
times of war or a public emergency: 
        


 SECTION 6. 
Freedom from Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, an Absolute Right
.
 â Torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment as criminal acts shall apply to all circumstances. A state of
 war or a threat of war, internal political instability, or any other 
public emergency, or a document or any determination comprising an 
"order of battle" shall not and can never be invoked as a justification 
for torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment. 




 Accordingly, the law provides remedies for victims of torture or other cruel, degrading, and inhuman treatment or punishment: 
        


 SECTION 9. 
Institutional Protection of Torture Victims and Other Persons Involved
. â A victim of torture shall have the following rights in the institution of a criminal complaint for torture: 




 (a) To have a prompt and an impartial investigation by 
the CHR and by agencies of government concerned such as the Department 
of Justice (DOJ), the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), the PNP, the 
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the AFP. A prompt 
investigation shall mean a maximum period of sixty (60) working days 
from the time a complaint for torture is filed within which an 
investigation report and/or resolution shall be completed and made 
available. An appeal whenever available shall be resolved within the 
same period prescribed herein; 


 (b) To have sufficient government protection against all
 forms of harassment, threat and/or intimidation as a consequence of the
 filing of said complaint or the presentation of evidence therefor. In 
which case, the State through its appropriate agencies shall afford 
security in order to ensure his/her safety and all other persons 
involved in the investigation and prosecution such as, but not limited 
to, his/her lawyer, witnesses and relatives; and 


 (c) To be accorded sufficient protection in the manner 
by which he/she testifies and presents evidence in any
 for a
 in order to
 avoid further trauma. 




 SECTION 10. 
Disposition of Writs of Habeas Corpus, Amparo and Habeas Data Proceedings and Compliance with a Judicial Order
. â A 
writ of habeas corpus
 or 
writ of amparo
 or 
writ of habeas


 data
 proceeding, if any, filed on behalf of the victim of torture or 
other cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment or punishment shall be 
disposed of expeditiously and any order of release by virtue thereof, or
 other appropriate order of a court relative thereto, shall be executed 
or complied with immediately. 


 SECTION 11. 
Assistance in Filing a Complaint
 â The 
CHR and the PAO shall render legal assistance in the investigation and 
monitoring and/or filing of the complaint for a person who suffers 
torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, 
or for any interested party thereto. 


 The victim or interested party may also seek legal 
assistance from the Barangay Human Rights Action Center (BHRAC) nearest 
him/her as well as from human rights nongovernment organizations (NGOs).
[125]
 




 From these provisions alone, it is clear that the State is 
meant to protect its people's right against cruel, degrading, and 
inhuman punishment.
        
 
II (B)


 Petitioners likewise invoke their rights to life and 
health, which they claim are being threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
They allege that by being detained in inhumane prison conditions, their 
lives are at risk of catching the disease. 
        
 All persons enjoy the right to life. This is enshrined under Article III, Section I of the 1987 Constitution: 
        


 SECTION 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, 
or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied 
the equal protection of the laws. 




 In 
Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo
,
[126]

 this Court granted the first petition for a writ of amparo, recognizing
 the right to life, liberty, and security of victims of enforced 
disappearances. It clarified that the right to life is not only a 
guarantee of the right to live, but to 
live securely
, assured that the State will protect the security of one's life and property: 
        


 
While the right to life under Article III, Section 1 guarantees essentially the right to be alive

 â upon which the enjoyment of all other rights is preconditioned â the 
right to security of person is a guarantee of the secure quality of this
 life, viz.: "The life to which each person has a right is not a life 
lived in fear that his person and property may be unreasonably violated 
by a powerful ruler. 
Rather, it is a life lived with the assurance 
that the government he established and consented to, will protect the 
security of his person and property.
 The ideal of security in life 
and property. . . pervades the whole history of man. It touches every 
aspect of man's existence." In a broad sense, 
the right to security 
of person "emanates in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of 
his life, his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation
. It 
includes the right to exist, and the right to enjoyment of life while 
existing, and it is invaded not only by a deprivation of life but also 
of those things which are necessary to the enjoyment of life according 
to the nature, temperament, and lawful desires of the individual."
[127]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 In the same case, this Court expounded that the right to 
security, as an adjunct of the right to life, is broken down to its 
essential components: (1) freedom from fear; (2) guarantee of "bodily 
and psychological integrity or security"; and (3) government protection 
of rights: 
        


 A closer look at the right to security of person would yield various permutations of the exercise of this right. 


 
First, the right to security of person is "freedom from fear"
.
 In its "whereas" clauses, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR) enunciates that "a world in which human beings shall enjoy 
freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been 
proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people." Some 
scholars postulate that "freedom from fear" is not only an aspirational 
principle, but essentially an individual international human right. 
It is the "right to security of person" as the word "security" itself means "freedom from fear"
. Article 3 of the UDHR provides, viz.: 




 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. 




 In furtherance of this right declared in the UDHR, Article
 9 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) also provides for the right to security of person, viz.: 




 1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of 
person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No 
one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in 
accordance with such procedure as are established by law. 




 The Philippines is a signatory to both the UDHR and the ICCPR. 


 . . . . 


 
Second, the right to security of person is a guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity or security
.
 Article III, Section II of the 1987 Constitution guarantees that, as a 
general rule, one's body cannot be searched or invaded without a search 
warrant. Physical injuries inflicted in the context of extralegal 
killings and enforced disappearances constitute more than a search or 
invasion of the body. It may constitute dismemberment, physical 
disabilities, and painful physical intrusion. As the degree of physical 
injury increases, the danger to life itself escalates. Notably, in 
criminal law, physical injuries constitute a crime against persons 
because they are an affront to the bodily integrity or security of a 
person. 


 
Physical torture, force, and violence are a severe 
invasion of bodily integrity. When employed to vitiate the free will 
such as to force the victim to admit, reveal or fabricate incriminating 
information, it constitutes an invasion of both bodily and psychological
 integrity as the dignity of the human person includes the exercise of 
free will.
 Article III, Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution more specifically proscribes bodily and psychological invasion, viz.: 




 (2) No torture, force, violence, threat or intimidation,
 or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used against 
him (any person under investigation for the commission of an offense). 
Secret detention places, solitary, incommunicado or other similar forms 
of detention are prohibited. 




 Parenthetically, under this provision, threat and 
intimidation that vitiate the free willâalthough not involving invasion
 of bodily integrityânevertheless constitute a violation of the right 
to security in the sense of "freedom from threat" as afore-discussed. 


 Article III, Section 12 guarantees freedom from 
dehumanizing abuses of persons under investigation for the commission of
 an offense. Victims of enforced disappearances who are not even under 
such investigation should all the more be protected from these 
degradations. 


 An overture to an interpretation of the right to security 
of person as a right against torture was made by the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR) in the recent case of Popov v. Russia. In this case,
 the claimant, who was lawfully detained, alleged that the state 
authorities had physically abused him in prison, thereby violating his 
right to security of person. Article 5(1) of the European Convention on 
Human Rights provides, viz.: "Everyone has the right to liberty and 
security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the 
following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law 
..." (emphases supplied) Article 3, on the other hand, provides that 
"(n)o one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment." Although the application failed on the facts 
as the alleged ill-treatment was found baseless, the ECHR relied heavily
 on the concept of security in holding, viz.: 




 . . . the applicant did not bring his allegations to the
 attention of domestic authorities at the time when they could 
reasonably have been expected to take measures in order to ensure his 
security and to investigate the circumstances in question. 


 . . . . 


 . . . the authorities failed to ensure his security in 
custody or to comply with the procedural obligation under Art. 3 to 
conduct an effective investigation into his allegations. 




 The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women has also made a statement that the protection of the 
bodily integrity of women may also be related to the right to security 
and liberty, viz.: 




 . . . gender-based violence which impairs or nullifies 
the enjoyment by women of human rights and fundamental freedoms under 
general international law or under specific human rights conventions is 
discrimination within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention (on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). These rights
 and freedoms include . . . the right to liberty and security of person.
 




 
Third, the right to security of person is a guarantee of protection of one's rights by the government
.
 In the context of the writ of amparo, this right is built into the 
guarantees of the right to life and liberty under Article III, Section 1
 of the 1987 Constitution and the right to security of person (as 
freedom from threat and guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity)
 under Article III, Section 2. The right to security of person in this 
third sense is a corollary of the policy that the State "guarantees full
 respect for human rights" under Article II, Section 11 of the 1987 
Constitution. As the government is the chief guarantor of order and 
security, the Constitutional guarantee of the rights to life, liberty 
and security of person is rendered ineffective if government does not 
afford protection to these rights especially when they are under threat.
 Protection includes conducting effective investigations, organization 
of the government apparatus to extend protection to victims of 
extralegal killings or enforced disappearances (or threats thereof) 
and/or their families, and bringing offenders to the bar of justice. The
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights stressed the importance of 
investigation in the 
Velasquez Rodriguez Case
, viz.: 




 (The duty to investigate) must be undertaken in a 
serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained to be 
ineffective. An investigation must have an objective and be assumed by 
the State as its own legal duty, not as a step taken by private 
interests that depends upon the initiative of the victim or his family 
or upon their offer of proof, without an effective search for the truth 
by the government.
[128]

 In his separate opinion in 
People v. Echegaray
,
[129]
 Justice Artemio V. Panganiban discussed that the right to life includes the right to enjoy it with dignity and honor: 
        


 So too, all our previous Constitutions, including the 
first one ordained at Malolos, guarantee that "(n)o person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law." This 
primary right of the people to enjoy life â life at its fullest, life in
 dignity and honor â is not only reiterated by the 1987 Charter but is 
in fact fortified by its other pro-life and pro-human rights provisions.
 
Hence, the Constitution values the dignity of every human person and
 guarantees full respect for human rights, expressly prohibits any form 
of torture which is arguably a lesser penalty than death
, emphasizes
 the individual right to life by giving protection to the life of the 
mother and the unborn from the moment of conception and establishes the 
people's rights to health, a balanced ecology and education. 


 This Constitutional explosion of concern for man more than
 property, for people more than the state, and for life more than mere 
existence augurs well for the strict application of the constitutional 
limits against the revival of death penalty as the final and 
irreversible exaction of society against its perceived enemies. 


 Indeed, volumes have been written about individual rights 
to free speech, assembly and even religion. But the most basic and most 
important of these rights is the right to life. Without life, the other 
rights cease in their enjoyment, utility and expression.
[130]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 An essential component of the right to life, and equally fundamental, is the right to health. In 
Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr.
:
[131]




 A component to the right to life is the constitutional 
right to health. In this regard, the Constitution is replete with 
provisions protecting and promoting the right to health. 


 Section 15, Article II of the Constitution provides: 




 Section 15. The State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. 




 A portion of Article XIII also specifically provides for the States' duty to provide for the health of the people, viz.: 


HEALTH




Section 11. The State shall adopt an integrated and 
comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to 
make essential goods, health and other social services available to all 
the people at affordable cost. There shall be priority for the needs of 
the underprivileged, sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children. The 
State shall endeavor to provide free medical care to paupers. 


 Section 12. The State shall establish and maintain an 
effective food and drug regulatory system and undertake appropriate 
health, manpower development, and research, responsive to the country's 
health needs and problems. 


 Section 13. The State shall establish a special agency 
for disabled persons for their rehabilitation, self-development, and 
self-reliance, and their integration into the mainstream of society.
[132]
 






 The right to life and the right to health are guaranteed in 
our international laws. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights provides that everyone has a right to health, well-being, and 
medical care: 
        


 (1) 
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself

 and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care 
and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of
 unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of
 livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. 


 (2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care 
and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall 
enjoy the same social protection. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The International Covenant on Economic and Social and 
Cultural Rights also provides that everyone has the right to attain the 
highest standard of physical and mental health. To this end, state 
parties shall undertake all measures to prevent, treat, and control 
epidemics. Article 12 states: 
        


 Article 12 


 1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health. 


 2. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the 
present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall 
include those necessary for: 




 (a) The provision for the reduction of the 
stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development 
of the child; 


 (b) The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene; 


 (c) 
The prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases
; 


 (d) The creation of conditions which would assure to all
 medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness. 
(Emphasis supplied)  
            


II (C) 







        These rightsâthe right against torture, cruel, degrading, and 
inhuman punishment; and the rights to life and healthâare all anchored 
on the State's policy to value human dignity and to guarantee full 
respect for human rights.
[133]


 Reiterating the State's policy, the Anti-Torture Act
[134]
 extends these rights to all persons, including those detained, jailed, imprisoned, or held under custody: 
        


 SECTION 2. 
Statement of Policy
. â It is hereby declared the policy of the State: 




 (a) To value the dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights; 


 (b) To ensure that the human rights of all persons, 
including suspects, detainees and prisoners are respected at all times; 
and that no person placed under investigation or held in custody of any 
person in authority or, agent of a person in authority shall be 
subjected to physical, psychological or mental harm, force, violence, 
threat or intimidation or any act that impairs his/her free will or in 
any manner demeans or degrades human dignity; 


 (c) To ensure that secret detention places, solitary, 
incommunicado
 or other similar forms of detention, where torture may be carried out with impunity, are prohibited; and 


 (d) To fully adhere to the principles and standards on 
the absolute condemnation and prohibition of torture as provided for in 
the 1987 Philippine Constitution; various international instruments to 
which the Philippines is a State party such as, but not limited to, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the
 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT); and all other relevant international 
human rights instruments to which the Philippines is a signatory.
[135]
 






 This State policy is likewise found in the laws and rules 
governing the two (2) agencies tasked with the safekeeping and 
reformation of inmates and detainees: (1) the Bureau of Corrections; and
 (2) the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology. 
        
 Created under Republic Act No. 10575, the Bureau of 
Corrections is in charge of safekeeping and instituting reformation 
programs to national inmates sentenced to more than three years.
[136]

 It is a line bureau and a constituent unit of the Department of 
Justice, which has supervisory powers over its regulatory and 
quasi-judicial functions.
[137]


 Section 2 of the law declares that every prisoner's basic rights should be safeguarded and their general welfare promoted: 
        


 SECTION 2.
 Declaration of Policy
. â It is the 
policy of the State to promote the general welfare and safeguard the 
basic rights of every prisoner incarcerated in our national 
penitentiary. It also recognizes the responsibility of the State to 
strengthen government capability aimed towards the institutionalization 
of highly efficient and competent correctional services. 


 Towards this end, the State shall provide for the 
modernization, professionalization and restructuring of the Bureau of 
Corrections (BuCor) by upgrading its facilities, increasing the number 
of its personnel, upgrading the level of qualifications of their 
personnel and standardizing their base pay, retirement and other 
benefits, making it at par with that of the Bureau of Jail Management 
and Penology (BJMP). 




Under Section 3 of the law, the Bureau of Corrections is duty
 bound to provide the inmates' basic needs and to take measures for 
their reformation and reintegration into society: 
        


 SECTION 3. 
Definition of Terms
. â 




 (a) 
Safekeeping
, which is the custodial component
 of the BuCors present corrections system, shall refer to the act that 
ensures the public (including families of inmates and their victims) 
that national inmates are provided with their basic needs, completely 
incapacitated from further committing criminal acts, and have been 
totally cut off from their criminal networks (or contacts in the free 
society) while serving sentence inside the premises of the national 
penitentiary. This act also includes protection against illegal 
organized armed groups which have the capacity of launching an attack on
 any prison camp of the national penitentiary to rescue their convicted 
comrade or to forcibly amass firearms issued to prison guards. 


 (b) 
Reformation
, which is the rehabilitation 
component of the BuCor's present corrections system, shall refer to the 
acts which ensure the public (including families of inmates and their 
victims) that released national inmates are no longer harmful to the 
community by becoming reformed individuals prepared to live a normal and
 productive life upon reintegration to the mainstream society. 






 As provided in Section 4, the inmates' basic needs include 
"decent provision of quarters, food, water and clothing in compliance 
with established United Nations standards." The Bureau of Corrections 
shall likewise institute several reformation programs, as follows: 
        


 SECTION 4. 
The Mandates of the Bureau of Corrections
.
 â The BuCor shall be in charge of safekeeping and instituting 
reformation programs to national inmates sentenced to more than three 
(3) years. 








(a)


Safekeeping of 
National Inmates â The safekeeping of inmates shall include decent 
provision of quarters, food, water and clothing in compliance with 
established United Nations standards. The security of the inmates shall 
be undertaken by the Custodial Force consisting of Corrections Officers 
with a ranking system and salary grades similar to its counterpart in 
the BJMP.






 


 






(b)


Reformation of 
National Inmates â The reformation programs, which will be instituted by
 the BuCor for the inmates, shall be the following:






 


 


 








(1)


Moral and Spiritual Program; 








(2)


Education and Training Program;








(3)


Work and Livelihood Program;








(4)


Sports and Recreation Program;








(5)


Health and Welfare Program; and








(6)


Behavior Modification Program, to include Therapeutic Community. 










The rights and privileges of inmates and detainees
[138]

 are further specified in the Bureau of Corrections Operating Manual. 
Its Book I, Part II, Chapter 4, Section 4 includes provisions for 
standards of prison accommodation:




 SECTION 4. 
Prison Accommodation Standards
. â 


 a. All accommodations for the use of inmates shall meet 
requirements of sanitation and hygiene with emphasis on adequate 
ventilation, living space and lighting. 


 b. Bathrooms and washing areas shall be provided in every prison facility. 


 c. All areas regularly used by inmates shall be properly maintained and kept clean at all times. 


 d. Beds and clothing shall be neatly made up in a uniform 
manner at all times. Beds and buildings occupied by inmates shall be 
thoroughly disinfected at least once a month. 


 e. Cleanliness shall be maintained at all times in all dormitories or cells specially toilet and baths.


 f. As often as it is necessary, an inmate shall send his dirty clothes to the laundry.


 g. Every Sunday and holiday, if weather permits, inmates 
will expose their clothes, beds, bedding and so forth in the sunshine in
 an area designated for the purpose. Cleanliness of the premises of the 
dormitories and their surroundings shall be strictly enforced. Littering
 is prohibited. 


h. Inmates shall be served meals three (3) times a day. 
Breakfast shall be served not more than fourteen (14) hours after the 
previous day's dinner. 




 Book I, Part IV, Chapter 2, Section 3 further provides the inmates protection from institutional abuse: 
        


 SECTION 3. 
Protection of Inmate from Institutional Abuse
. â An inmate shall be treated with respect and fairness by prisons employees. 


 He shall be protected against the following: 


 a. the imposition of any cruel, unusual or degrading act as a form of disciplinary punishment.


 b. corporal punishment; 


c. the use of physical force by correctional officers, 
except in cases where the latter act in self-defense, to protect another
 person from imminent physical attack, or to prevent a riot or escape; 


d. deprivation of clothing, bed and bedding, light, ventilation, exercise, food or hygienic facilities; and 


e. forced labor. 




 On the other hand, the Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology was created under Republic Act No. 6975, a line bureau of the 
Department of the Interior and Local Government.
[139]

 Its primary function is to exercise control and supervision over all 
district, city, and municipal jails that detain "any fugitive from 
justice, or person detained awaiting investigation or trial and/or 
transfer to the national penitentiary, and/or violent mentally ill 
person . . . pending the transfer to a medical institution."
[140]


 The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology classifies 
persons deprived of liberty as either a prisoner or a detainee. A 
prisoner is a person convicted by a final judgment.
[141]
 Prisoners are further classified depending on their prison sentence: 
        










CLASSIFICATION OF PRISONER
 










PRISON SENTENCE
















Insular prisoner














three (3) years and one (1) day to reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment 


















Provincial prisoner 














six (6) months and one (1) day to three (3) years;


















City prisoner














one (1) day to three (3) years;


















Municipal prisoner














(1) day to six (6) months.
[142]














On the other hand, a detainee is a person undergoing investigation, trial, or awaiting final judgment from a court.
[143]


 In any case, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology is 
tasked with supervising and controlling all district, city, and 
municipal jails, guided by the principle of humane treatment in the 
safekeeping and development of persons deprived of liberty. Thus, it 
shall provide their basic needs, conduct rehabilitation activities, and 
improve jail facilities and conditions. It shall ensure adequately 
equipped sanitary facilities and quality services for their custody, 
safekeeping, rehabilitation, and development.
[144]


 All persons deprived of liberty under the custody of the
 Bureau of Jail Management and Penology likewise have specific rights 
and privileges. These include the rights to be treated as human beings; 
to not be subjected to corporal punishment; to adequate food, space and 
ventilation, rest and recreation; to avail themselves of medical, 
dental, and other health services. They likewise have the privilege of 
being visited and treated anytime by a doctor of their choice, or 
treated in a government or private hospital if necessary and allowed by 
the rules.
[145]


Moreover, under the same Manual, the Bureau of Jail 
Management and Penology shall aim to "improve the living conditions of 
offenders, in accordance with the accepted standards set by the United 
Nations."
[146]


 The Manual expressly references the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners,
[147]

 or the Nelson Mandela Rules, on the rule on segregation of prisoners 
and the treatment of prisoners with special needs, which include senior 
citizens, infirm inmates with contagious diseases, pregnant women, and 
female inmates with infants. Rule IV, Section 34 provides the following 
guidelines: 
        


 SECTION 34. Handling Inmates with Special Needs. â The 
following guidelines shall be observed in handling inmates with special 
needs: 


 . . . . 


 11. Senior Citizen Inmates 




a. Senior citizen inmates should be segregated and close 
supervised to protect them from maltreatment and other forms of abuse by
 other inmates; 


b. Individual case management strategies should be developed and adopted to respond to the special needs of elderly inmates; 


c. Collaboration with other government agencies and 
community- based senior citizen organizations should be done to ensure 
that the services due the senior citizen inmates are provided; and d. 
Senior citizen inmates should be made to do tasks deemed fit and 
appropriate, their age, capability, and physical condition considered. 




 12. Infirm Inmates




 a. Inmates with contagious diseases must be segregated to prevent the spread of said contagious diseases; 


b. Infirm inmates should be referred to the jail physician or nurse for evaluation and management; and 


c. Infirm inmates must be closely monitored and provide with appropriate medication and utmost care. 




 13. Pregnant Inmates/Female Inmates with Infants 




a. Pregnant inmates must be referred to jail physician or nurse for pre-natal examination; 


b. They should be given tasks that are deemed fit and proper, their physical limitations, considered; 


c. During active labor, pregnant inmates should be transferred nearest government hospital; 


d. Treatment of mother and her infant/s shall be in accordance with the BJMP Policy (Refer to DIWD Manual); and


 e. Female inmates with infants shall be provided with ample privacy during breastfeeding activity. 






III 








 The constitutional rights to life and health, the 
prohibition against torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment,
 and the State policy to guarantee full respect for human dignity are 
affirmed in the international laws and standards that bind us. These 
fundamental rights, anchored on the recognition of the inherent dignity 
of every human being, have acquired the status of universal application 
as 
jus cogens,
 or 'compelling law.'
[148]
 


 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"
[149]
 and declares that every human being is entitled to "the right to life, liberty, and security of persons."
[150]


 Moreover, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
[151]
 expressly provides that persons deprived of liberty do not shed their "inherent dignity." Article 10 states: 
        


 Article 10 


 1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the 
inherent dignity of the human person
. 


 2. 


 (a) Accused persons shall, save in exceptional 
circumstances, be segregated from convicted persons and shall be subject
 to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted 
persons; 


 (b) Accused juvenile persons shall be separated from adults and brought as speedily as possible for adjudication. 


 3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of 
prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and 
social rehabilitation. Juvenile offenders shall be segregated from 
adults and be accorded treatment appropriate to their age and legal 
status. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The inherent dignity of persons deprived of liberty as human
 beings, as with their humane treatment, is a "fundamental and 
universally applicable rule."
[152]
 It applies without any distinction, and does not depend on the available material resources of a state party. 
        
 The Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners
[153]

 provides that all prisoners retain all their rights under the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights and other international covenants where a 
state is a member party: 
        


 5. Except for those limitations that are demonstrably 
necessitated by the fact of incarceration, all prisoners shall retain 
the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and, where the State concerned is a party, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, as well as such other rights as are set out 
in other United Nations covenants. 




 Furthermore, on December 9, 1975, the United Nations General
 Assembly declared that no state may permit torture or other cruel, 
inhuman, or degrading punishment.
[154]

 Not even exceptional circumstances such as war, internal political 
instability, and other public emergency can justify any of these 
prohibited acts.
[155]


 On December 9, 1988, the United Nations General Assembly
 also adopted the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons 
under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment,
[156]
 which upholds the human rights of persons under any form of detention or imprisonment: 
        


 Principle 3 


 There shall be no restriction upon or derogation from any 
of the human rights of persons under any form of detention or 
imprisonment recognized or existing in any State pursuant to law, 
conventions, regulations or custom on the pretext that this Body of 
Principles does not recognize such rights or that it recognizes them to a
 lesser extent. 




 On May 13, 1977, the United Nations Economic and Social 
Council adopted the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners, which set the universally accepted minimum standards for 
prisoner treatment and prison management.
[157]

 These rules are "generally accepted as being good principle and 
practice in the treatment of prisoners and the management of 
institutions."
[158]


 Recently, on December 17, 2015, the United Nations 
General Assembly revised the rules to reflect the changes in 
international law and the advances in correctional science and good 
management practices in correctional institutions. From then on, the 
revised rules were called
 the Nelson Mandela Rules
, which 
contains provisions for minimum standards in prison accommodations, 
personal hygiene, food and nutrition, access to health care services, 
among others.
[159]


 Incidentally, Justice Delos Santos states that Article 
38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides the 
sources of international law, which are traditionally characterized as 
either peremptory or non-peremptory in nature.
[160]

 He discusses that in order to have domestic application, these norms 
will have to either be incorporated or transformed into domestic law. 
Citing the UN Charter, he proceeds to characterize the Nelson Mandela 
Rules as merely recommendatory, with no binding effect. 
        
 I disagree. 
        
 The peremptoriness of a norm is not a mere categorization of international law.
[161]
 
Jus cogens
, or peremptory norms, are the "highest category of customary international law."
[162]
 A prominent modern definition is that "(t)he rules of 
jus cogens

 [are] those rules which derive from principles that the legal 
conscience of [hu]mankind deem[s] absolutely essential to coexistence in
 the international community."
[163]


 These definitions have been incorporated in 
Bayan Muna v. Romulo
:
[164]




 "The term '
jus cogens
' means the 'compelling law.'" Corollary, "a
 jus cogens
 norm holds the highest hierarchical position among all other customary norms and principles." As a result, 
jus cogens
 norms are deemed "peremptory and non-derogable."When applied to international crimes, "
jus cogens

 crimes have been deemed so fundamental to the existence of a just 
international legal order that states cannot derogate from them, even by
 agreement." 


 These 
jus cogens
 crimes relate to the principle of 
universal jurisdiction, i.e., "any state may exercise jurisdiction over 
an individual who commits certain heinous and widely condemned offenses,
 even when no other recognized basis for jurisdiction exists." "The 
rationale behind this principle is that the crime committed is so 
egregious that it is considered to be committed against all members of 
the international community" and thus granting every State jurisdiction

 Among the fundamental rights established as 
jus cogens
 are the right to life and the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.
[166]

 These non-derogable international customary norms have been reiterated 
in several conventions that the Philippines signed and ratified, as 
previously discussed. 
        
 In any case, the non-derogable international laws are 
not the only rules governing the international community. For instance, a
 treaty creating the World Trade Organization, or a Security Council 
Resolution defining a terrorist organization, are non-peremptory in that
 accession is optional; yet, they still have significant effects on the 
international community. As elegantly captured in Justice Antonio 
Carpio's dissent in 
Bayan Muna
: 
        


 Some customary international laws have been affirmed and 
embodied in treaties and conventions. A treaty constitutes evidence of 
customary law if it is declaratory of customary law, or if it is 
intended to codify customary law. In such a case, even a State not party
 to the treaty would be bound thereby. A treaty which is merely a formal
 expression of customary international law is enforceable on all States 
because of their membership in the family of nations. For instance, the 
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is binding even on non-party 
States because the provisions of the Convention are mostly codified 
rules of customary international law binding on all States even before 
their codification into the Vienna Convention. Another example is the 
Law of the Sea, which consists mostly of codified rules of customary 
international law, which have been universally observed even before the 
Law of the Sea was ratified by participating States. 


 Corollarily, treaties may become the basis of customary 
international law. While States which are not parties to treaties or 
international agreements are not bound thereby, such agreements, if 
widely accepted for years by many States, may transform into customary 
international laws, in which case, they bind even non-signatory States.

 Therefore, the Nelson Mandela Rules and its precedent, the 
United Nations Minimum Standard on the Treatment of Prisoners, cannot 
simply be disregarded as non-binding norms. The principles and 
fundamental rights on which these declarations are basedâthe right to 
life, the prohibition of torture, and the prohibition of cruel and 
unusual punishmentâhave attained a 
jus cogens
 status. These Rules have been adhered to and transformed into local legislation and incorporated in our penal institutions. 
        
 To view a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly as not being 
jus cogens
,
 only being recommendatory, is limited. It fails to consider that a 
resolution of the United Nations General Assembly may be any of the 
following: (1) an articulation of a customary international norm; (2) a 
reiteration of existing treaty obligations; (3) a reflection of emerging
 international norms and standards, or commonly referred to as "soft 
law"; or (4) a binding source of obligation that is judicially 
enforceable once acceded to by a member state. 
        
 
First
, the Nelson Mandela Rules articulates 
customary international norms on the treatment of prisoners. These are 
based on one's fundamental dignity, including those under confinement. 
These are codified into several declarations and conventions that the 
Philippines have ratified. 
        
 In 
Razon v. Tagitis
,
[168]

 this Court recognized "resolutions relating to legal questions in the 
[United Nations] General Assembly" as material sources of international 
customs: 
        


 The most widely accepted statement of sources of 
international law today is Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the 
International Court of Justice, which provides that the Court shall 
apply "international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted 
as law." The material sources of custom include State practice, State 
legislation, international and national judicial decisions, recitals in 
treaties and other international instruments, a pattern of treaties in 
the same form, the practice of international organs, and resolutions 
relating to legal questions in the UN General Assembly. Sometimes 
referred to as "evidence" of international law, these sources identify 
the substance and content of the obligations of States and are 
indicative of the "State practice" and "
opinio juris
" requirements of international law.

 It is erroneous to dismiss the Nelson Mandela Rules just 
because the United Nations General Assembly resolutions are only 
recommendatory. The preambulatory clauses of Resolution No. 70/175,
[170]

 which adopted the Nelson Mandela Rules, state that the precedent United
 Nations Minimum Standard on the Treatment of Prisoners has already 
attained the status of a "universally acknowledged minimum standards for
 the detention of prisoners and that they have been of significant value
 and influence."
[171]


 
Second
, a resolution of the United Nations 
General Assembly may reiterate an existing treaty obligation, as in the 
preambulatory clause of Resolution No. 70/175: 
        


 Taking into account the progressive development of 
international law pertaining to the treatment of prisoners since 1955, 
including in international instruments such as the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the 
Optional Protocol thereto [.] 




 Notably, the Philippines acceded
[172]
 to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
[173]
 This embraces the following obligations: 
        


 
Article 2
 






1.


Each State Party 
shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other 
measures to prevent ads of torture in any territory under its 
jurisdiction.
 






 


 






2.


No exceptional circumstances whatsoever
, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability 
or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture. 






 


 






3.


An order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of torture.








. . . . 






 






Article 11






 






Each State Party 
shall keep under systematic review interrogation rules, instructions, 
methods and practices as well as arrangements for the custody and 
treatment of persons subjected to any form of arrest, detention or 
imprisonment in any territory under its jurisdiction, with a view to 
preventing any cases of torture






. . . . 






 






Article 16












1.


Each State Party shall 
undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts 
of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not 
amount to torture as defined in article 1
, when such acts are 
committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or 
acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official 
capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 
12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of
 references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.






 


 






2.


The provisions of this Convention
 are without prejudice to the provisions of any other international 
instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion. 
(Emphasis supplied)








The Philippines also acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.
[174]

 Among its objectives is to establish regular visits of detention places
 and prisons from international and domestic bodies to prevent torture 
and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment.


 
Third
, the Nelson Mandela Rules reflects emerging 
international norms and standards, or commonly referred to as "soft 
law." It partakes of "new soft law standards" that function as a 
"significant normative reference for national legislators, courts, 
correctional administrators, and advocates on a range of prison 
conditions issues."
[175]


 In 
Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines v. Duque III
,
[176]
 this Court held that a "soft law," while not necessarily binding, has great political influence: 
        


 "Soft law" does not fall into any of the categories of 
international law set forth in Article 38, Chapter III of the 1946 
Statute of the International Court of Justice. It is, however, an 
expression of non-binding norms, principles, and practices that 
influence state behavior. Certain declarations and resolutions of the UN
 General Assembly fall under this category. The most notable is the UN 
Declaration of Human Rights, which this Court has enforced in various 
cases, specifically, 
Government of Hongkong Special Administrative 
Region v. Olalia, Mejoff v. Director of Prisons, Mijares v. RaÃ±ada and 
Shangri-la International Hotel Management, Ltd. v. Developers Group of 
Companies, Inc
. 


 The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a 
specialized agency attached to the UN with the mandate to promote and 
protect intellectual property worldwide, has resorted to soft law as a 
rapid means of norm creation, in order "to reflect and respond to the 
changing needs and demands of its constituents."' Other international 
organizations which have resorted to soft law include the International 
Labor Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization (in the 
form of the 
Codex Alimentarius
). 


 WHO has resorted to soft law. This was most evident at the
 time of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian flu 
outbreaks. 


 Although the IHR Resolution does not create new 
international law binding on WHO member states, it provides an excellent
 example of the power of "soft law" in international relations. 
International lawyers typically distinguish binding rules of 
international law-"hard law"-from non-binding norms, principles, and 
practices that influence state behavior-"soft law." WHO has during its 
existence generated many soft law norms, creating a "soft law regime" in
 international governance for public health. 


 The "soft law" SARS and IHR Resolutions represent 
significant steps in laying the political groundwork for improved 
international cooperation on infectious diseases. These resolutions 
clearly define WHO member states' normative duty to cooperate fully with
 other countries and with WHO in connection with infectious disease 
surveillance and response to outbreaks. 


 This duty is neither binding nor enforceable, but, in the 
wake of the SARS epidemic, the duty is powerful politically for two 
reasons. First, the SARS outbreak has taught the lesson that 
participating in, and enhancing, international cooperation on infectious
 disease controls is in a country's self interest . . . if this warning 
is heeded, the "soft law" in the SARS and IHR Resolution could inform 
the development of general and consistent state practice on infectious 
disease surveillance and outbreak response, perhaps crystallizing 
eventually into customary international law on infectious disease 
prevention and control.
[177]
 (Citations omitted) 




 
Finally
, the Nelson Mandela Rules could not be 
ignored, precisely because the Philippines adopted these standards 
through its express adherence to the established standards of the United
 Nations under Republic Act No. 10575, or the Bureau of Corrections Act 
of 2013. Section 4 states: 
        


 SECTION 4. The Mandates of the Bureau of Corrections. â 
The BuCor shall be in charge of safekeeping and instituting reformation 
programs to national inmates sentenced to more than three (3) years. 


 (a) Safekeeping of National Inmates â The safekeeping of 
inmates shall include decent provision of quarters, food, water and 
clothing 
in 
compliance with established United Nations standards
.
 The security of the inmates shall be undertaken by the Custodial Force 
consisting of Corrections Officers with a ranking system and salary 
grades similar to its counterpart in the BJMP. 


 . . . . 


 SECTION 5. Operations of the Bureau of Corrections. â (a) 
The BuCor shall operate with a directorial structure. It shall undertake
 reception of inmates through its Directorate for Reception and 
Diagnostics (DRD), formerly Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC), 
provide basic needs and security through its Security and Operations 
Directorates, administer reformation programs through its Reformation 
Directorates, and prepare inmates for reintegration to mainstream 
society through its Directorate for External Relations (DER), formerly 
External Relations Division (ERD). 


 . . . . 


 (c) Aside from those borne of the provisions under Rule 8, Part I, Rules of General Application of the 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners

 and that of the existing regulation of the BuCor on security 
classification (i.e., maximum, medium and minimum security risk), 
inmates shall also be internally classified by the DRD and segregated 
according to crimes committed based on the related penal codes such as 
Crimes Against Persons, Crimes Against Properties, Crimes Against 
Chastity, so on and so forth, as well as by other related Special Laws, 
Custom and Immigration Laws. (Emphasis supplied) 




 While the law was enacted in 2013, prior to the adoption of 
the Nelson Mandela Rules in 2015, its express wording refers to 
standards adopted by the United Nations. 
        
 Yet, Justice Delos Santos opines that with the sorry 
state of our penal institutions, we can only dream of complying with the
 Nelson Mandela Rules.
[178]
 
Thus, while he recognizes that the Philippines adhered to the United 
Nations standards in safekeeping its prisoners under Section 4, he notes
 that these standards cannot be judicially enforced.
[179]


 As such, he declares
[180]

 that this Court is not empowered to compel the Bureau of Corrections to
 implement Section 4(a), which requires safekeeping of persons deprived 
of liberty that complies "with established United Nations standards." He
 finds this provision not self-executing, as it confers no rights that 
can be judicially enforced, being "so generic" and silent as to its 
implementation. He states that the provision simply provides guidelines 
for executive action as to how inmates will be accommodated.
[181]


 Justice Delos Santos further discusses that the words 
used in the Nelson Mandela Rules are so vague that the ministerial duty 
sought to be enforced through an injunctive writ cannot be determined.
[182]

 He asserts that a court cannot simply invent parameters for what 
constitutes "reasonable" or "special" accommodations, or adjust any 
implementing rule or regulation on equitable considerations.
[183]


 I disagree. This Court has the power to compel the Bureau of Corrections to implement Section 4 of Republic Act No. 10575. 
        
 Judicial action on the enforcement of a law is based on a
 cause of action, which is "the act or omission by which a party 
violates the right of another."
[184]
 Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution states: 
        


 SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law. 


 Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving 
rights which are legally demandable and enforceable
,
 and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of 
any branch or instrumentality of the Government. 




 What determines judicial power is the existence of one's 
right and its violation by another person or entity. This power is not 
restricted by the vagueness of the words used in the law, or the absence
 of parameters as to what constitutes a violation of the right. 
        
 Regardless, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 10575 clearly 
creates a right and indicates the standards by which that right is 
fleshed out. Petitioners assert a violation of that right. There is, 
thus, a cause of action that calls for the exercise of judicial power. 
        
 I oppose creating a distinction between self-executing 
provisions and not self-executing provisions in statutes. I had 
previously maintained that this should not be made in any of the 
constitutional provisions, as it "creates false second-order 
constitutional provisions":
        


 I do not agree, however, in making distinctions between self-executing and non-self-executing provisions. 


 A self-executing provision of the Constitution is one 
"complete in itself and becomes operative without the aid of 
supplementary or enabling legislation." It "supplies [a] sufficient rule
 by means of which the right it grants may be enjoyed or protected." "[ 
I]f the nature and extent of the right conferred and the liability 
imposed are fixed by the constitution itself, so that they can be 
determined by an examination and construction of its terms, and there is
 no language indicating that the subject is referred to the legislature 
for action," the provision is self-executing. 


 On the other hand, if the provision "lays down a general 
principle," or an enabling legislation is needed to implement the 
provision, it is not self-executing. 


 To my mind, the distinction creates false second-order 
constitutional provisions. It gives the impression that only 
self-executing provisions are imperative. 


 All constitutional provisions, even those providing 
general standards, must be followed. Statements of general principles 
and policies in the Constitution are frameworks within which branches of
 the government are to operate. The key is to examine if the provision 
contains a prestation and to which branch of the government it is 
directed. If addressed either to the legislature or the executive, the 
obligation is not for this Court to fulfill. 


 . . . . 


 There are no second-order provisions in the Constitution. 
We create this category when we classify the provisions as 
"self-executing" and "non-self executing." Rather, the value of each 
provision is implicit in their normative content.
[185]
 (Citations omitted) 




 The same can be said of all statutes. Mandatory provisions 
should be deemed as imperative, and their authoritative or operative 
effect should not be diminished on account of their "vagueness" or the 
lack of parameters. It cannot be assumed that a statute is not meant to 
be complied with. To do so is to nullify the mandatory language of the 
provision and render legislative power useless. 
        
 Compliance with legal provisions cannot solely depend on
 the presence of specific implementing rules and regulations. Justice 
Delos Santos recognized this himself when he discussed that the 
implementing rules and regulationsâcontaining matters related to the 
standards under the Nelson Mandela Rulesâis subordinate legislation, 
which is not a source of substantive rights and obligations.
[186]


 As Justice Lazaro-Javier says, laws that use general 
terms, like the Nelson Mandela Rules, do not make them any less 
judicially enforceable.
[187]
 
Even if a certain law lacks a degree of specificity, the executive 
branch must still comply with its mandate. Similarly, courts should not 
shy away from interpreting what constitutes compliance with the law 
using the rules on statutory construction. Courts are not meant to 
create new parameters, but to interpret statutes. We can neither shirk 
from this duty nor excuse the other government branches' failure to 
comply with their legal mandates. 
        
 I also agree with Justice Lazaro-Javier's position that 
budgetary restrictions, while it may be a factor in implementation, do 
not determine the existence and enforceability of a right.
[188]

 As she aptly points, this Court should not be restricted by the State's
 budget concerns in determining the existence and enforcement of a 
right.
[189]


 It is not the Nelson Mandela Rules as written that 
should be in focus. What is relevant are the founding principles of 
international law on which the Nelson Mandela Rules are based. The first
 sentence of the Nelson Mandela Rules' preambulatory clause states that 
in its adoption, the United Nations General Assembly was guided by the 
"fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person,
 without distinction of any kind."
[190]

 These fundamental human rights include the right to life and the 
prohibition against torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
punishment, both of which are anchored on one's inherent dignity.
[191]


 These principles are affirmed by the 1987 Constitution as a State policy.
[192]

 Thus, persons deprived of liberty must be treated with humanity and 
with respect for their inherent dignity. Furthermore, "provisions on the
 right to life, prohibition from torture, inhuman and degrading 
treatment, and slavery remain free from any derogation whatsoever, 
having acquired a 
jus cogens
 character."
[193]


 More important, the Philippines' compliance with the 
United Nations standards should be assessed based on how the country 
understood the implications of adherence to these standards. This is 
done by examining the texts of applicable local legislations and 
administrative issuances of penal institutions. These local and 
international rules and standards operationalize the State's duty on the
 safekeeping of its prisoners and affirm how the inherent dignity of a 
person is to be valued, even when deprived of liberty. 
        
 As discussed at length earlier, our local laws and the 
international standards we have adhered to reveal that while our 
prisoners and detainees' right to liberty is restricted, their right to 
be treated humanely, including their right to reasonably safe, sanitary,
 and sufficient provisions and facilities, is not suspended and is not 
merely recommendatory. Thus, no extraordinary circumstance, not even the
 global COVID-19 pandemic, can justify actions violating these 
fundamental rights. 
        
 
IV


 Considering the various sources of rights of persons 
deprived of liberty, incarcerated individuals may file an appropriate 
action based on a violation of these rights. 
        
 Violations of the constitutional right against cruel, 
degrading, and inhuman punishment, the rights to life and health, the 
rights of prisoners and detainees under international law principles and
 conventions, and our own local laws, rules, and procedures are 
justiciable matters. 
        
 I agree with Justice Perlas-Bernabe that we should not 
diminish the possibility that persons deprived of liberty may avail of 
their rights as listed in the Bill of Rights, including their right to 
be protected against cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.
[194]


 Under Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution, 
courts are given judicial power "to settle actual controversies 
involving 
rights which are legally demandable and enforceable
, 
and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of 
any branch or instrumentality of the Government."
[195]


 The Bill of Rights is an enumeration of rights that are 
legally demandable and enforceable
.
 Courts will hear and decide cases involving violations of these rights,
 or any statute providing standards to comply with these rights. This 
aspect of judicial review, to measure the constitutionality of a 
government act or inaction vis-a-vis an enumeration of an individual or 
group right, is even more established than the expanded jurisdiction now
 contained in Article VIII, Section 1. 
        
 Thus, with respect to actual controversies involving 
violations of fundamental constitutional rights, this Court is not 
powerless to ensure its respect and implementation. It is precisely why 
this Court exists. 
        
 I thus disagree with Justice Delos Santos' statement 
that "only Congress has the constitutional power to address subhuman 
conditions that plague our penal institutions."
[196]

 He would have this Court "defer to the political branches as regards 
the matter of selecting the most appropriate strategy to maintain public
 order and preserve public safety."
[197]
 Such position reduces the Judiciary's role in relation to the Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights.
        
 First, petitioners' cause of action calls for this 
Court's interpretation of constitutional text. When this Court 
interprets the Constitution and fleshes out its text, its decisions form
 part of the law of the land. The Judiciary's constitutional 
interpretations are guided not only by the Constitution itself, but by 
precedents that have construed the text and articulated its intent 
through particular circumstances. In 
David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal
:
[198]




 Reading a certain text includes a consideration of 
jurisprudence that has previously considered that exact same text, if 
any. Our legal system is founded on the basic principle that "[j]udicial
 decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall 
form part of [our] legal system." Jurisprudence is not an independent 
source of law. Nevertheless, judicial interpretation is deemed part of 
or written into the text itself as of the date that it was originally 
passed. This is because judicial construction articulates the 
contemporaneous intent that the text brings to effect. Nevertheless, one
 must not fall into the temptation of considering prior interpretation 
as immutable.
[199]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Since petitioners anchor their cause of action on their 
constitutionally protected rights, courts have the power to settle the 
controversy, and to articulate and apply what the Constitution, 
statutes, and rules and regulations provide in relation to the right. 
        
 Furthermore, the vagueness of the Bill of Rights' 
provisions does not detract from their enforceability. In fact, they 
were written so to leave room for future instances that can shed further
 light on how the provisions are to be interpreted. The Constitution is 
not meant to pertain to a specific moment that would restrict its 
application to a limited set of facts. Rather, it is meant to 
encapsulate circumstances that may go beyond what was initially imagined
 by its framers. Thus, when faced with a justiciable controversy, the 
Judiciary has the power to define what constitutes a violation of these 
provisions.
        
 In 
J. M. Tuason & Company, Inc. v. Land Tenure Administration
:
[200]




 It could thus be said of our Constitution as of the United
 States Constitution, to borrow from Chief Justice Marshall's 
pronouncement in 
M'Culloch v. Maryland
 that it is "intended to 
endure for ages to come and consequently, to be adapted to the various 
crisis of human affairs." It cannot be looked upon as other than, in the
 language of another American jurist, Chief Justice Stone, "a continuing
 instrument of government." Its framers were not visionaries, toying 
with speculations or theories, but men of affairs, at home in 
statecraft, laying down the foundations of a government which can make 
effective and operative all the powers conferred or assumed, with the 
corresponding restrictions to secure individual rights and, 
anticipating, subject to the limitations of human foresight, the 
problems that events to come in the distant days ahead will bring. Thus a
 constitution, to quote from Justice Cardozo, "states or ought to state 
not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding future."
 


 To that primordial intent, all else is subordinated. Our 
Constitution, any constitution, is not to be construed narrowly or 
pedantically, for the prescriptions therein contained, to paraphrase 
Justice Holmes, are not mathematical formulas having their essence in 
their form, but are organic living institutions, the significance of 
which is vital nor formal. There must be an awareness, as with Justice 
Brandeis, not only of what has been, but of what may be. The words 
employed by it are not to be construed to yield fixed and rigid answers 
but as impressed with the necessary attributes of flexibility and 
accommodation to enable them to meet adequately whatever problems the 
future has in store. It is not, in brief a printed finality but a 
dynamic process.
[201]
 (Citations omitted) 




 In 
Secretary of Justice v. Lantion
:
[202]




 The due process clauses in the American and Philippine 
Constitutions are not only worded in exactly identical language and 
terminology, but more importantly, they are alike in what their 
respective Supreme Courts have expounded as the spirit with which the 
provisions are informed and impressed, the elasticity in their 
interpretation, their dynamic and resilient character which make them 
capable of meeting every modern problem, and their having been designed 
from earliest time to the present to meet the exigencies of an undefined
 and expanding future. The requirements of due process are interpreted 
in both the United States and the Philippines as not denying to the law 
the capacity for progress and improvement. Toward this effect and in 
order to avoid the confines of a legal straitjacket, the courts instead 
prefer to have the meaning of the due process clause "gradually 
ascertained by the process of inclusion and exclusion in the course of 
the decisions of cases as they arise" (Twining vs. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 
78). Capsulized, it refers to "the embodiment of the sporting idea of 
fair play" (Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Owner's Association vs. City 
Mayor of Manila, 20 SCRA 849 [1967]). It relates to certain immutable 
principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government 
(Holden vs. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366).
[203]
 




 Thus, in my separate opinion in 
Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK) v. Quezon City
,
[204]
 emphasized that the right to life and liberty under the Bill of Rights evolves and expands to our current realities: 
        


 It is in this sense that the constitutional listing of the
 objects of due process protection admits amorphous bounds. The 
constitutional protection of life and liberty encompasses a penumbra of 
cognate rights that is not fixed but evolves â expanding liberty â 
alongside the contemporaneous reality in which the Constitution 
operates. 
People v. Hernandez
 illustrated how the right to liberty is multi-faceted and is not limited to its initial formulation in the due process clause: 




 [T]he preservation of liberty is such a major 
preoccupation of our political system that, not satisfied with 
guaranteeing its enjoyment in the very first paragraph of section (1) of
 the Bill of Rights, the framers of our Constitution devoted paragraphs 
(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), 
(18), and (21) of said section (1) to the protection of several aspects 
of freedom. 




 While the extent of the constitutional protection of life 
and liberty is dynamic, evolving, and expanding with contemporaneous 
realities, the mechanism for preserving life and liberty is immutable: 
any intrusion into it must be with due process of law and must not run 
afoul of the equal protection of the laws.

 In 
Social Weather Stations, Inc. v. Commission on Elections
,
[206]

 this Court discussed that judicial interpretation entails a holistic 
approachâconsidering both the history and the contemporary, the 
realities and the ideals, as effected by the Constitution and statutes: 
        


 Interestingly, both COMELEC and petitioners appeal to what
 they (respectively) construe to be plainly evident from Section 
5.2(a)'s text: on the part of COMELEC, that the use of the words "paid 
for" evinces no distinction between direct purchasers and those who 
purchase via subscription schemes; and, on the part of petitioners, that
 Section 5.2(a)'s desistance from actually using the word "subscriber" 
means that subscribers are beyond its contemplation. The variance in the
 parties' positions, considering that they are both banking on what they
 claim to be the Fair Election Act's plain meaning, is the best evidence
 of an extant ambiguity. 


 Second, statutory construction cannot lend itself to 
pedantic rigor that foments absurdity. The dangers of inordinate 
insistence on literal interpretation are commonsensical and need not be 
belabored. These dangers are by no means endemic to legal 
interpretation. Even in everyday conversations, misplaced literal 
interpretations are fodder for humor. A fixation on technical rules of 
grammar is no less innocuous. A pompously doctrinaire approach to text 
can stifle, rather than facilitate, the legislative wisdom that 
unbridled textualism purports to bolster. 


 Third, the assumption that there is, in all cases, a 
universal plain language is erroneous. In reality, universality and 
uniformity in meaning is a rarity. A contrary belief wrongly assumes 
that language is static. 


 
The more appropriate and more effective approach is,
 thus, holistic rather than parochial: to consider context and the 
interplay of the historical, the contemporary, and even the envisioned.

 Judicial interpretation entails the convergence of social realities and
 social ideals. The latter arc meant to be effected by the legal 
apparatus, chief of which is the bedrock of the prevailing legal order: 
the Constitution. Indeed, the word in the vernacular that describes the 
Constitution â saligan â demonstrates this imperative of constitutional 
primacy.
 


 Thus, we refuse to read Section 5.2(a) of the Fair 
Election Act in isolation. Here, we consider not an abstruse provision 
but a stipulation that is part of the whole, 
i.e
., the statute of
 which it is a part, that is aimed at realizing the ideal of fair 
elections. We consider not a cloistered provision but a norm that should
 have a present authoritative effect, to achieve the ideals of those who
 currently read, depend on, and demand fealty from the Constitution.
[207]

 Bearing in mind its functions in constitutional 
interpretation, it cannot be said that the Judiciary is powerless in any
 capacity to address the subhuman conditions in our jails and prisons. 
        
 Still, Justice Delos Santos argues that only Congress 
has the power to address the state of our penal institutions. He cites 
the constitutional deliberations in discussing that it is the 
legislature that determines what constitutes a violation of the right 
against cruel and inhuman punishment.
[208]


 In 
David
,
[209]

 this Court discussed that a resort to these deliberations should be the
 last option, as doing so would be prone to "subjective interpretation" 
and "the greatest errors":
        


 In the hierarchy of the means for constitutional 
interpretation, inferring meaning from the supposed intent of the 
framers or fathoming the original understanding of the individuals who 
adopted the basic document is the weakest approach. 


 These methods leave the greatest room for subjective 
interpretation. Moreover, they allow for the greatest errors. The 
alleged intent of the framers is not necessarily encompassed or 
exhaustively articulated in the records of deliberations. Those that 
have been otherwise silent and have not actively engaged in 
interpellation and debate may have voted for or against a proposition 
for reasons entirely their own and not necessarily in complete agreement
 with those articulated by the more vocal. It is even possible that the 
beliefs that motivated them were based on entirely erroneous premises. 
Fathoming original understanding can also misrepresent history as it 
compels a comprehension of actions made within specific historical 
episodes through detached, and not necessarily better-guided, modern 
lenses.
[210]
 




 Moreover, the original intent of the Constitution's framers 
is not always uniform with the original understanding of the people who 
ratified it. In 
Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary
:
[211]




 While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult 
the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to
 arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort 
thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are 
powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is 
clear. Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value as showing
 the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for 
their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large 
majority who did not talk, much less of the mass of our fellow citizens 
whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental 
law. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears 
upon its face." 
The proper interpretation therefore depends more on 
how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framer's 
understanding thereof
.
[212] 
(Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 Thus, it cannot be assumed that violations of the 
petitioners' constitutional right against cruel, unusual, and degrading 
punishment is solely left for Congress to address. 
        
 
V


 Considering that the violation of constitutional rights 
is a justiciable matter, aggrieved persons deprived of liberty can file 
an action in the proper trial court.
[213]


 If yet to be convicted, such that the case is still on 
trial or on appeal, detainees should be able to file a motion for 
release invoking a violation of their constitutional right. If already 
convicted with finality, a prisoner should be able to file for a writ of
 
habeas corpus
. This is in line with 
Gumabon v. Director of the Bureau of Prisons
,
[214]

 where this Court allowed the release of prisoners after a finding that 
their detention violated their constitutional right to equal protection 
of the laws: 
        


 1. The fundamental issue, to repeat, is the availability of the writ of 
habeas corpus

 under the circumstances disclosed. Its latitudinarian scope to assure 
that illegality of restraint and detention be avoided is one of the 
truisms of the law. It is not known as the writ of liberty for nothing. 
The writ imposes on judges the grave responsibility of ascertaining 
whether there is any legal justification for a deprivation of physical 
freedom. Unless there be such a showing, the confinement must thereby 
cease. If there be a valid sentence it cannot, even for a moment, be 
extended beyond the period provided for by law. Any deviation from the 
legal norms call for the termination of the imprisonment. 


 . . . . 


 2. Where, however, the detention complained of finds its 
origin in what has been judicially ordained, the range of inquiry in a 
habeas corpus proceeding is considerably narrowed. For if "the person 
alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer 
under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or 
order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction
 to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order," the writ
 does not lie. That principle dates back to 1902, when this Court 
announced that 
habeas corpus
 was unavailing where the person 
detained was in the custody of an officer under process issued by a 
court or magistrate. That is understandable, as during the time the 
Philippines was under American rule, there was necessarily an adherence 
to authoritative doctrines of constitutional law there followed. 


 One such principle is the requirement that there be a finding of jurisdictional defect. As summarized by Justice Bradley in 
Ex parte

 Siebold, an 1880 decision: "The only ground on which this court, or any
 court, without some special statute authorizing it, will give relief on
 
habeas corpus
 to a prisoner under conviction and sentence of 
another court is the want of jurisdiction in such court over the person 
or the cause, or some other matter rendering its proceedings void." 


 There is the fundamental exception though, that must ever 
be kept in mind. Once a deprivation of a constitutional right is shown 
to exist, the court that rendered the judgment is deemed ousted of 
jurisdiction and 
habeas corpus
 is the appropriate remedy to assail the legality of the detention. 


 3. Petitioners precisely assert a deprivation of a 
constitutional right, namely, the denial of equal protection. According 
to their petition: "In the case at bar, the petitioners were convicted 
by Courts of First Instance for the very same rebellion for which 
Hernandez, Geronimo, and others were convicted. The law under which they
 were convicted is the very same law under which the latter were 
convicted. It had not and has not been changed. For the same crime, 
committed under the same law, how can we, in conscience, allow 
petitioners to suffer life imprisonment, while others can suffer only 
prision mayor
?" 


 They would thus stress that, contrary to the mandate of 
equal protection, people similarly situated were not similarly dealt 
with. What is required under this constitutional guarantee is the 
uniform operation of legal norms so that all persons under similar 
circumstances would be accorded the same treatment both in the 
privileges conferred and the liabilities imposed. As was noted in a 
recent decision: "Favoritism and undue preference cannot be allowed. For
 the principle is that equal protection and security shall be given to 
every person under circumstances, which if not identical are analogous. 
If law be looked upon in terms of burden or charges, those that fall 
within a class should be treated in the same fashion, whatever 
restrictions cast on some in the group equally binding on the rest." 


 The argument of petitioners thus possesses a persuasive 
ring. The continued incarceration after the twelve-year period when such
 is the maximum length of imprisonment in accordance with our 
controlling doctrine, when others similarly convicted have been freed, 
is fraught with implications at war with equal protection. That is not 
to give it life. On the contrary, it would render it nugatory. 
Otherwise, what would happen is that for an identical offense, the only 
distinction lying in the finality of the conviction of one being before 
the Hernandez ruling and the other after, a person duly sentenced for 
the same crime would be made to suffer different penalties. Moreover, as
 noted in the petition before us, after our ruling in 
People v. Lava
,
 petitioners who were mere followers would be made to languish in jail 
for perhaps the rest of their natural lives when the leaders had been 
duly considered as having paid their penalty to society, and freed. Such
 a deplorable result is to be avoided.
[215]
 (Citations omitted) 




 However, to be entitled to the reliefs mentioned, one must 
first allege and prove the following: (a) the existing inhuman, 
degrading, or cruel conditions not organic or consistent with the 
statutory punishment imposed; (b) the violation of a clear, enforceable 
constitutional provision or a local or international law; (c) a clear 
demand on the relevant agencies of government; and (d) the intentional 
or persistent refusal or negligence on the part of the government agency
 or official to address the cruel conditions of the violation of the 
statutory or constitutional provisions. 
        
 Justice Perlas-Bernabe finds that our laws addressing 
jail congestion are lacking, and the rules on release on bail or 
recognizance do not expressly consider the conditions of confinement.
[216]
 Thus, she and Justice Caguioa borrow the "deliberate indifference standard" used in the United States cases of 
Estelle v. Gamble
[217]
 and 
Helling v. McKinney
.
[218]


 While I agree that those cases may be relevant to this case, these are only persuasive to this Court.
[219]
 Rather, the guidelines in 
Alejano v. Cabuay
,
[220]

 the same case where this Court discussed punishment, may be used in 
granting reliefs against violations of the right against cruel, 
degrading, and inhuman punishment, right to life, and right to health of
 persons deprived of liberty. 
        
 In the 2005 case of 
Alejano
, junior military 
officers staged a mutiny against the then President and took control of 
Oakwood Premier Luxury Apartments. After a failed attempt, they 
voluntarily surrendered and were taken in custody. Later, they filed a 
petition for 
habeas corpus
, alleging that their confinement 
conditions violated their right against cruel and unusual punishment. 
They specifically cry afoul on the bars that separated them from their 
visitors and the iron grills and plywood in their individual cells. 
        
 This Court dismissed the petition, as the petitioners 
failed to convince the court to infer punishment from the inherent 
restrictions of confinement: 
        


 Petitioners further argue that the bars separating the 
detainees from their visitors and the boarding of the iron grills in 
their cells with plywood amount to unusual and excessive punishment. 
This argument fails to impress us. 
Bell v. Wolfish
 pointed out 
that while a detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of 
guilt in accordance with due process of law, detention inevitably 
interferes with a detainee's desire to live comfortably. 
The fact 
that the restrictions inherent in detention intrude into the detainees' 
desire to live comfortably does not convert those restrictions into 
punishment. It is when the restrictions are arbitrary and purposeless 
that courts will infer intent to punish. Courts' will also infer intent 
to punish even if the restriction seems to be related rationally to the 
alternative purpose if the restriction appears excessive in relation to 
that purpose.
 Jail officials are thus not required to use the 
least restrictive security measure. They must only refrain from 
implementing a restriction that appears excessive to the purpose it 
serves. 


 We quote 
Bell v. Wolfish
: 




 One further point requires discussion. The petitioners 
assert, and respondents concede, that the "essential objective of 
pretrial confinement is to insure the detainees' presence at trial." 
While this interest undoubtedly justifies the original decision to 
confine an individual in some manner, we do not accept respondents' 
argument that the Government's interest in ensuring a detainee's 
presence at trial is the only objective that may justify restraints and 
conditions once the decision is lawfully made to confine a person. "If 
the government could confine or otherwise infringe the liberty of 
detainees only to the extent necessary to ensure their presence at 
trial, house arrest would in the end be the only constitutionally 
justified form of detention." The Government also has legitimate 
interests that stem from its need to manage the facility in which the 
individual is detained. These legitimate operational concerns may 
require administrative measures that go beyond those that are, strictly 
speaking, necessary to ensure that the detainee shows up at trial. For 
example, the Government must be able to take steps to maintain security 
and order at the institution and make certain no weapons or illicit 
drugs reach detainees. Restraints that are reasonably related to the 
institution's interest in maintaining jail security do not, without 
more, constitute unconstitutional punishment, even if they are 
discomforting and are restrictions that the detainee would not have 
experienced had he been released while awaiting trial. We need not here 
attempt to detail the precise extent of the legitimate governmental 
interests that may justify conditions or restrictions of pretrial 
detention. It is enough simply to recognize that in addition to ensuring
 the detainees' presence at trial, the effective management of the 
detention facility once the individual is confined is a valid objective 
that may justify imposition of conditions and restrictions of pretrial 
detention and dispel any inference that such restrictions are intended 
as punishment. 




 An action constitutes a punishment when (1) that action 
causes the inmate to suffer some harm or "disability," and (2) the 
purpose of the action is to punish the inmate. Punishment also requires 
that the harm or disability be significantly greater than, or be 
independent of, the inherent discomforts of confinement. 


 
Block v. Rutherford
, which reiterated 
Bell v. Wolfish
,
 upheld the blanket restriction on contact visits as this practice was 
reasonably related to maintaining security. The safety of innocent 
individuals will be jeopardized if they are exposed to detainees who 
while not yet convicted are awaiting trial for serious, violent offenses
 and may have prior criminal conviction. Contact visits make it possible
 for the detainees to hold visitors and jail staff hostage to effect 
escapes. Contact visits also leave the jail vulnerable to visitors 
smuggling in weapons, drugs, and other contraband. The restriction on 
contact visits was imposed even on low-risk detainees as they could also
 potentially be enlisted to help obtain contraband and weapons. The 
security consideration in the imposition of blanket restriction on 
contact visits was ruled to outweigh the sentiments of the detainees. 


 
Block v. Rutherford
 held that the prohibition of 
contact visits bore a rational connection to the legitimate goal of 
internal security. This case reaffirmed the "handsoff" doctrine 
enunciated in 
Bell v. Wolfish,
 a form of judicial self-restraint,
 based on the premise that courts should decline jurisdiction over 
prison matters in deference to administrative expertise. 


 In the present case, we cannot infer punishment from the 
separation of the detainees from their visitors by iron bars, which is 
merely a limitation on contact visits. The iron bars separating the 
detainees from their visitors prevent direct physical contact but still 
allow the detainees to have visual, verbal, non-verbal and limited 
physical contact with their visitors. The arrangement is not unduly 
restrictive. In fact, it is not even a strict noncontact visitation 
regulation like in 
Block v. Rutherford
. The limitation on the 
detainees' physical contacts with visitors is a reasonable, non-punitive
 response to valid security concerns. 


 The boarding of the iron grills is for the furtherance of 
security within the ISAFP Detention Center. This measure intends to 
fortify the individual cells and to prevent the detainees from passing 
on contraband and weapons from one cell to another. The boarded grills 
ensure security and prevent disorder and crime within the facility. The 
diminished illumination and ventilation are but discomforts inherent in 
the fact of detention, and do not constitute punishments on the 
detainees. 


 We accord respect to the finding of the Court of Appeals 
that the conditions in the ISAFP Detention Center are not inhuman, 
degrading and cruel. Each detainee, except for Capt. Nicanor Faeldon and
 Capt. Gerardo Gambala, is confined in separate cells, unlike ordinary 
cramped detention cells. The detainees are treated well and given 
regular meals. The Court of Appeals noted that the cells are relatively 
clean and livable compared to the conditions now prevailing in the city 
and provincial jails, which are congested with detainees. The Court of 
Appeals found the assailed measures to be reasonable considering that 
the ISAFP Detention Center is a high-risk detention facility. Apart from
 the soldiers, a suspected New People's Army ("NPA") member and two 
suspected Abu Sayyaf members are detained in the ISAFP Detention Center.
[221]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 In 
Alejano
, this Court adopted the tests in the United States case of 
Bell v. Wolfish
[222]

 in determining the "intent to punish" from the restrictions and 
conditions of confinement: (1) if these are arbitrary, purposeless, and 
do not satisfy a government interest; (2) assuming that there is an 
alternative government interest (
i.e
. facilities' operational concerns), if the conditions appear "excessive in relation to that purpose."
        
 Applying these tests, this Court held that the bar 
installation was not unduly restrictive, and intended to secure the 
detainees. Also, the illumination and ventilation were held to be 
"inherent in the fact of detention, and do not constitute punishments on
 the detainees." Moreover, this Court held that their overall 
conditionsâtheir individual confinement, regular meals, clean and 
livable cellsâwere not inhuman, degrading, and cruel, as compared to the
 congested city and provincial jails. Thus, this Court did not infer an 
intent to punish in their case. 
        
 I maintain that persons deprived of liberty have a cause
 of action for violation of the right against cruel, degrading, and 
inhuman punishment if their current state of detention is no longer 
organic to the fact of their detention. As Justice Caguioa pointed out,
[223]
 
Alejano

 affirmed that the violations of the constitutional rights of persons 
deprived of liberty are within the court's power of review. In 
Alejano
: 
        


 The ruling in this case, however, does not foreclose the 
right of detainees and convicted prisoners from petitioning the courts 
for the redress of grievances. Regulations and conditions in detention 
and prison facilities that violate the Constitutional rights of the 
detainees and prisoners will be reviewed by the courts on a case-by-case
 basis. The courts could afford injunctive relief or damages to the 
detainees and prisoners subjected to arbitrary and inhumane conditions. 
However, 
habeas corpus
 is not the proper mode to question 
conditions of confinement. The writ of habeas corpus will only lie if 
what is challenged is the fact or duration of confinement. (Citations 
omitted)
[224]
 




 Contrary to 
Alejano
, however, I view that a petition for 
habeas corpus
 may also be a proper remedy to question conditions of confinement. 
        
 Thus, in allowing petitioners' temporary release, the 
ultimate issue to be resolved is whether or not the State has been 
maintaining their jail or detention facilities in compliance with the 
Constitution, local laws, and international standards on the rights of 
persons deprived of liberty. 
        
 However, a mere allegation that constitutional rights 
have been violated is insufficient. I agree with Justice Caguioa that 
the causal link between notorious jail conditions and a person deprived 
of liberty's exclusion from the standard of care available to a free 
person must be proven first. This is necessary to sustain a cause of 
action anchored on the right against cruel and inhuman punishment and 
relevant international laws.
[225]


 Thus, to reiterate, petitioners must be able to satisfy 
the following requisites: (a) the existing inhuman, degrading, or cruel 
conditions not organic or consistent with the statutory punishment 
imposed; (b) the violation of a clear, enforceable constitutional 
provision or a local or international law; (c) a clear demand on the 
relevant government agency; and (d) the government agency's intentional 
or persistent refusal or negligence to address the cruel conditions of 
the violation of the statutory or constitutional provisions. 
        
 I emphasize the third and fourth requisites: before the 
court can conclude a violation of constitutional rights, there must have
 been a clear demand on the relevant government agency, and in turn, a 
wanton denial or unreasonable negligence on the agency's part. This is 
in keeping with the doctrine of separation of powers. As Justice Caguioa
 correctly puts it, addressing jail congestion is a "policy question and
 formulation" under the jurisdiction of the executive and legislative 
branches of government.
[226]
 Thus, the courts must first defer to the capabilities of the other constitutional organs. 
        
 
VI


 In this case, the claims of petitioners in relation to 
these standards clearly require the presentation of evidence in the 
trial court. Several factual determinations must be made before a ruling
 can be had on whether there is a violation of their constitutional 
rights. 
        
 It is correct that this Court may take judicial notice 
of the nature of COVID-19 and the longstanding jail congestion which has
 plagued the Philippine jails. This unresolved crisis is a significant 
threat to the right to life, health, and security of persons in 
congested penal facilities, whose conditions make social distancing 
impossible. 
        
 While factual allegations must be proven by evidence, 
courts may take judicial notice of particular circumstances. Rule 129, 
Sections 1 to 3 of the Rules of Court state: 
        


 SECTION 1. 
Judicial notice, when mandatory
. â A 
court shall take judicial notice, without the introduction of evidence, 
of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political 
history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of 
nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals,
 the political constitution and history of the Philippines, 
the official acts of the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the Philippines
, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions. 


 SECTION 2. 
Judicial notice, when discretionary
. â A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of 
public knowledge
, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions. 


 SECTION 3. Judicial 
notice, when hearing necessary.

 â During the trial, the court, on its own initiative, or on request of a
 party, may announce its intention to take judicial notice of any matter
 and allow the parties to be heard thereon. 


 After the trial, and before judgment or on appeal, the 
proper court, on its own initiative or on request of a party, may take 
judicial notice of any matter and allow the parties to be heard thereon 
if such matter is decisive of a material issue in the case. (Emphasis 
supplied) 




 From these, this Court has summed up the requisites of judicial notice. In 
State Prosecutors v. Muro
:
[227]
 




 Generally speaking, matters of judicial notice have three 
material requisites: (1) the matter must be one of common and general 
knowledge; (2) it must be well and authoritatively settled and not 
doubtful or uncertain; and (3) it must be known to be within the limits 
of the jurisdiction of the court. The principal guide in determining 
what facts may be assumed to be judicially known is that of notoriety. 
Hence, it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced
 by public records and facts of general notoriety.
[228]
 (Citations omitted) 


 Thus, this Court may take judicial notice of the state of 
jail congestion in the Philippines, the nature of transmission of 
COVID-19, and its deadly effects.

The occupancy rate is obtained through dividing the number of
 detainees by 4.7 square meters, which is the ideal habitable floor area
 per inmate, according to the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology's 
Revised Manual on Habitat, Water, Sanitation and Kitchen in Jails.
[230]
 If the quotient is above 100, it means the jail is congested.
[231]


 Meanwhile, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology has 
neither published its data on jail congestion nor included it in the 
Verified Report it submitted to this Court. Nonetheless, based on the 
Commission on Audit's annual review on the Bureau's facilities, as of 
December 31, 2018, the total occupancy rate is at 439.48%. It is broken

The Commission on Audit found that the jail populations 
increased because of the increase in drug-related cases, pendency of 
cases, and non-release on bail due to poverty.
[233]

 It noted that this congestion results in unhealthy living conditions of
 inmates, which goes against the requirements of its governing Manual 
and the United Nations standards.
[234]


 Based on its findings, the Commission on Audit recommended 
the following actions for the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology: 
        


 We recommended that Management: 


 (a) continue its efforts in making representations with 
concerned government agencies in addressing the congestion problems in 
all jail facilities; 


 (b) prioritize acquisition of lots and construction programs and projects aimed at improving the jail facilities; 


 (c) require the Regional Bids and Awards Committee to 
ensure timely completion of all procurement activities pertaining to the
 construction and/or improvement of all jail facilities in order to 
decongest overcrowded jails; and


 (d) enhance and intensify the GCTA process and give more 
emphasis on the Recognizance Act for detainees early release without 
necessarily completing their sentence which could significantly reduce 
jail population and congestion.
[235]
 




 According to the World Prison Brief, the Philippines' 
occupancy level is at 463.6%, the second highest among all the prisons 
in the world.
[236]


 In 2012, the United Nations Committee Against Torture 
alerted the Philippines to provide information on measures undertaken to
 address overcrowding in penitentiary institutions.
[237]

 In 2016, it raised its concern against the deplorable living conditions
 in jails, detention centers, and police lock-up cells, which may 
qualify as ill treatment or torture: 
        


 Conditions of detention 


 27. 
The Committee is concerned at the persistence of 
appalling conditions of detention prevailing in the State party, both in
 police lock-up cells and the jails and detention facilities run by the 
Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, which do not meet minimum 
international standards and may constitute ill-treatment or torture. 
It
 is particularly concerned at the persistence of critical and chronic 
overcrowding in all detention facilities, some of which may be operating
 at 380 percent of capacity. Conditions in all places of deprivation of 
liberty include dilapidated and small cells, in some of which detainees 
are forced to sleep while sitting or standing, unsanitary conditions, 
inadequate amounts of food, poor nutrition, insufficient natural and 
artificial lighting and poor ventilation, which cause inter-prisoner 
violence and the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, the
 incidence of which is extremely high. The Committee is particularly 
alarmed at information that tuberculosis eradication programmes were not
 a priority in the past because they were seen as irrelevant to the 
maintenance of security. The Committee is concerned about sexual 
violence against detained persons and about the treatment of detainees 
belonging to minorities (arts. 2, 11 and 16).

VI (B)


 COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new type 
of coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). Generally, coronaviruses cause respiratory infections to 
humans, which range from mild to severe. The Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, both viral outbreaks 
that had swept the Philippines years ago, were both caused by 
coronaviruses. 
        
 COVID-19 was first encountered in Wuhan, China last December 2019.
[239]
 On January 9, 2020, its first death was publicly recorded.
[240]


 The common symptoms of this disease include fever, dry 
cough, and tiredness. Some manifestations include aches and pains, nasal
 congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, 
anosmia
 (loss of smell), and 
dysgeusia
 (loss of taste).
[241]
 These signs begin mildly and may gradually progress.
[242]


 According to the World Health Organization, 80% of 
infected persons recover from COVID-19 without needing hospital 
treatment. However, one of every five people becomes seriously ill and 
develops difficulty breathing. Any person can be seriously ill, but 
those who are of advanced age, and those with underlying medical 
problems such as high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes,
 cancer, or immunosuppression have a higher chance of worsening 
conditions.
[243]


 COVID-19 is highly contagious.
[244]

 Some get infected but do not develop any symptoms or feel unwell; some 
only experience mild symptoms. However, even those with zero to very 
mild symptoms can transmit the virus if they carry it.
[245]

 In fact, COVID-19 has since spread worldwide, prompting the World 
Health Organization to declare it a pandemicâthe first one caused by a 
coronavirus.
[246]


 The World Health Organization had initially found that 
the virus spreads when a COVID-19-positive person expels small droplets 
from the nose or mouth through speaking, coughing, or sneezing. People 
can catch COVID-19 "if they breathe in these droplets," or if they 
touched objects or surfaces on which the droplets are expelled and then 
they touched their eyes, nose, or mouth. It later noted that "airborne 
transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where 
specific medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, 
generate very small droplets called aerosols." It also reported that 
some outbreaks in indoor crowded spaces suggested the possibility of 
combined aerosol and droplet transmission, citing examples such as 
during choir practice, in restaurants or in fitness classes.
[247]


 Thus, the World Health Organization lists several 
recommendations to prevent transmission. These include frequent hand 
hygiene, physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, avoiding "crowded 
places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with 
poor ventilation," wearing fabric masks, and "good environmental 
ventilation in all closed settings and appropriate environmental 
cleaning and disinfection."
[248]


 As of now, there is no vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and no proven cure for COVID-19.
[249]


 All these factors have caused the entire world to undergo extraordinary changes to cope with the situation. 
        
 In the Philippines, where the first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 30, 2020,
[250]

 the Department of Health has recommended measures to slow its spread, 
including personal hygiene, social distancing, environmental 
cleanliness, and food safety.
[251]
 It also advised against public events and gatherings.
[252]


 The government has imposed travel bans,
[253]
 raised the COVID-19 Alert to Code Red sublevel 2âthe highest level of national response management
[254]
âannounced a state of calamity throughout the country for six months,
[255]

 and declared a national emergency. President Rodrigo Duterte was also 
given emergency powers to address the state of public health emergency.
[256]


 Several levels of community quarantine measuresâgeneral,
 enhanced, to extreme enhanced along with their modified versionsâwere 
imposed all over the country, depending on each locality's situation. 
Notably, work was suspended in the executive branch, and the other 
branches were encouraged to follow suit. Private enterprises made 
flexible work arrangements. Land, domestic air, and domestic sea travel 
to and from Metro Manila were suspended.
[257]

 Local governments started imposing curfews, implementing quarantine 
passes, providing support to health workers, and distributing relief 
goods.
[258]


 Quarantine was extended several times,
[259]

 and was subsequently modified based on the locality after consideration
 of the developments of the COVID-19 epidemiological curve, health 
capacity, and economic, security, and social factors.
        
 Yet, based on publicly available Department of Health 
data, the total number of cases continues to rise. In particular, 
Moreover, several news reports announced positive cases of and deaths 
related to COVID-19 in jails.
[260]


 While the Bureau of Corrections and the Bureau of Jail 
Management and Penology submitted Verified Reports on the measures taken
 to address the disease, they admit that social distancing is necessary 
to disrupt the spread of the virus. They also concede that this is 
unachievable in all of the penal facilities in the Philippines.
[261]
 Petitioners invoke the general absence of adequate medical and healthcare facilities to respond to basic needs of prisoners.
[262]


 Clearly, the nature of COVID-19 and the jail congestion 
in this country are matters that all courts may take judicial notice of.
 The fact of overcrowding in jails and the transmissibility of COVID-19 
no longer need further proof. However, even if this Court takes judicial
 notice of these circumstances, there are several facts that must first 
be determined in relation to the confinement of petitioners or any other
 person deprived of liberty seeking release. 
        
 This includes, among others, the latest data on jail 
congestion and measures taken to address the chronic problem of jail 
overcapacity; the capabilities of the prison systems where petitioners 
are detained to prevent the spread of COVID-19; the demands made by 
petitioners to the detention facilities; any unjustified refusal or 
negligence on the part of the detention facilities to act on their 
concerns. 
        
 Courts cannot grant a blanket release without 
determining these facts. Petitioners must establish the basis for their 
temporary release. To be released based on a violation of their 
constitutional rights, petitioners must still show the circumstances of 
their own detention and prove they are deprived of the basic and minimum
 standards of imprisonment. They should establish the individual 
conditions of their confinement which are not organic or consistent with
 the punishment imposed on them. They must invoke which constitutional 
rights are violated. They must show they have made a clear demand on the
 relevant government agencies, and that the latter intentionally or 
persistently refused or negligently failed to act on their concerns. 
They must ultimately show that the responsible government 
instrumentality has been compliant or negligent with constitutional, 
international, and local provisions and standards protecting their 
rights. 
        
 Justice Lazaro-Javier opines that while this Court may take judicial notice of jail congestion,
[263]

 the infringement of the minimum standards required under the law do not
 constitute cruel and inhuman punishment. To her, while it affects the 
severity of the punishment, it is merely incidental to the punishment.
[264]


 She also agrees that jail congestion has a bigger impact on petitioners' right to life during the pandemic.
[265]

 However, she finds that it cannot be said that the increased risks 
caused by COVID-19 on their right to life, security and health are the 
fault of respondents, such that the violation can be attributed to them.
 She holds that respondents committed no positive act to increase 
petitioners' risks or worsen the situation.
[266]

 Neither are they guilty of inaction or idleness since they have taken 
positive measures to minimize the spread of the virus and infection 
among the prisoners. Even assuming their measures were not sufficient, 
the inadequacy is attributable to other factors beyond the control and 
authority of respondents, including the unpredictability of the 
pandemic.
[267]


 Similarly, without trial on the merits, Justice Delos 
Santos is ready to conclude that petitioners' continued detention is not
 unnecessarily oppressive because they failed to show that the State has
 been "indifferent to their clinical needs."
[268]


 These are already factual conclusions that may only be 
determined in a proper hearing in the trial courts. I suggest that 
before this Court make any finding, a full-blown hearing is necessary. 
Without it, it cannot be established that jail congestion and the 
general lack of adequate medical facilities preclude respondents from 
preventing the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities. Without it, the 
question of whether petitioners' constitutional rights were violated 
remains unanswered. 
        
 
VII


 Finally, I suggest a measure grounded on social justice: that this Court provide a remedy called the writ of 
kalayaan
. 
        
 I recognize the many efforts and feats of this Court 
under Chief Justice Peralta's leadership to facilitate the release of 
qualified persons deprived of liberty.
[269]


 However, I urge this Court to move even further. In 
recognition of the pervasiveness of congestion in our jails, this Court 
should fashion a remedy called the writ of 
kalayaan
 similar to the writ of 
kalikasan
 or the writ of continuing mandamus in environmental cases. 
        
 This Court is not without precedent in formulating rules
 to address pervasive and urgent violations of constitutional rights 
with transcendental effects. In 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Concerned Residents of Manila Bay
,
[270]

 this Court issued, for the first time, a writ of continuing mandamus 
ordering various administrative agencies to fulfill their respective 
mandates to clean up and restore Manila Bay. Having appreciated the 
extraordinary circumstances, the urgency of the situation, and the 
extreme environmental degradation of Manila Bay, this Court upheld the 
right to a balanced and healthful ecology through the writ. 
        
 This Court likewise recognized that it needed to 
formulate special rules of procedure to enforce environmental laws and 
finally address the continuing violations of these laws. On April 10, 
2010, it promulgated the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases for 
the enforcement or violations of environmental and other related rules.
[271]
 The Rules provide the procedure for the issuance of a writ of 
kalikasan
,
[272]

 an "extraordinary remedy that covers environmental damages the 
magnitude of which transcends both political and territorial 
boundaries."
[273]
 The Rules also provide the issuance of a continuing mandamus,
[274]
 a "distinct procedure than that of ordinary civil actions for the enforcement/violation of environmental laws."
[275]


 This time, a writ of 
kalayaan
 should be issued 
when all the requirements to establish cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
punishment are present. This is necessary considering that the continued
 and malicious congestion of our jails does not affect only one 
individual. Its issuance is grounded on this Court's rule-making 
authority and the extreme situation brought upon by the COVID-19 
pandemic. As in 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority
, this 
Court is again being called to address a systemic problem that even the 
most basic health protocols to prevent the spread of the virus cannot, 
address. Jail congestion is as virulent as COVID-19 itself, especially 
in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic.
        
 The writ of 
kalayaan
 may require a more constant 
supervision by an executive judge for the traditional or extraordinary 
releases of convicts or detainees. It should provide an order of 
precedence in order to bring the occupation of jails to a more humane 
level. Those whose penalties are the lowest and whose crimes are brought
 about, not by extreme malice, but by the indignities of poverty may be 
prioritized. 
        
 Certainly, the writ of 
kalayaan 
will be the distinguishing initiative of the Peralta Courtâa measure that is grounded on social justice. 
        
 Persons deprived of liberty do not shed their humanity 
once they are taken into custody, yet the perennial congestion that 
plague our jails do not reflect this. Instead, they reveal our failure 
to respect the very fundamental rights that the State has guaranteed to 
protect. This wrong, which we have allowed to persist, is all the more 
pressing in the face of a highly contagious and deadly disease. Persons 
deprived of liberty are in need of more remedies to ensure that their 
detention do not prejudice their right to live. 
        
 Jail congestion harms so many individualsâmost of them 
poor, and therefore, invisible. The dawn of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
only made this a more urgent concern. We cannot just watch and sit idly 
by. 
        
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote that the Petition be referred
 to the appropriate trial courts to determine, upon proper motion or 
petition of the parties, whether there are factual bases supporting the 
temporary release of petitioners on the following grounds: 
        
 First, they are entitled to release on bail or recognizance, if still applicable; or
        
 Second, there is a violation of their constitutional 
right against cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment or other related 
constitutional rights, such that they may file either: (1) a motion for 
release if the case is still on trial or on appeal; or (2) petition a 
writ of 
habeas corpus
 as a post-conviction remedy. The grant of 
these remedies is subject to the establishment of the following 
requisites: (a) existing inhuman, degrading, or cruel conditions not 
organic or consistent with the statutory punishment imposed; (b) the 
conditions violate clear, enforceable statutory or constitutional 
provisions including judicially discernable international standards 
adopted in this jurisdiction; (c) a clear demand on the relevant 
government agency to address their grievance; and (d) the conditions are
 the result of intentional or persistent refusal or negligence on the 
part of the government agency, be it the warden, director of prisons, 
local government unit, or Congress. 
        
 I also vote that this Court 
En Banc
 create a subcommittee under the Committee on Rules to immediately draft a proposal for a writ of 
kalayaan

 to set the clearest guidance for the lower courts in adjudicating 
proven violations of the right against cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
punishment as a result of continuous congestion of detention centers or 
jails.

SECTION 17. 
Bail, Where Filed
. â (a) Bail in the 
amount fixed may be filed with the court where the case is pending, or 
in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with any regional
 trial judge, metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, or 
municipal circuit trial judge in the province, city, or municipality. If
 the accused is arrested in a province, city, or municipality other than
 where the case is pending, bail may also be filed with any regional 
trial court of said place, or if no judge thereof is available, with any
 metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit 
trial judge therein. (b) Where the grant of bail is a matter of 
discretion, or the accused seeks to be released on recognizance, the 
application may only be filed in the court where the case is pending, 
whether on preliminary investigation, trial, or appeal. (c) Any person 
in custody who is not yet charged in court may apply for bail with any 
court in the province, city, or municipality where he is held. (17a) 




 
[42]
 RULES OF COURT, Rule 114, secs. 8 and 18 provide:
        


 SECTION 8. 
Burden of Proof in Bail Application
. â 
At the hearing of an application for bail filed by a person who is in 
custody for the commission of an offense punishable by death,
 reclusion perpetua
,
 or life imprisonment, the prosecution has the burden of showing that 
evidence of guilt is strong. The evidence presented during the bail 
hearing shall be considered automatically reproduced at the trial but, 
upon motion of either party, the court may recall any witness for 
additional examination unless the latter is dead, outside the 
Philippines, or otherwise unable to testify. 

      SECTION 18. 
Notice of Application to Prosecutor
. â In the 
application for bail under section 8 of this Rule, the court must give 
reasonable notice of the hearing to the prosecutor or require him to 
submit his recommendation. (18a) 




 
[43]
 RULES OF COURT, Rule 114, sec. 5 provides
        


 SECTION 5. 
Bail, When Discretionary.
 â Upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
,
 or life imprisonment, admission to bail is discretionary. The 
application for bail may be filed and acted upon by the trial court 
despite the filing of a notice of appeal, provided it has not 
transmitted the original record to the appellate court. However, if the 
decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of
 the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can
 only be filed with and resolved by the appellate court. 

      Should the court grant the application, the accused may be allowed
 to continue on provisional liberty during the pendency of the appeal 
under the same bail subject to the consent of the bondsman. 

      If the penalty imposed by the trial court is imprisonment 
exceeding six (6) years, the accused shall be denied bail, or his bail 
shall be cancelled upon a showing by the prosecution, with notice to the
 accused, of the following or other similar circumstances: 




 (a) That he is a recidivist, quasi-recidivist, or 
habitual delinquent, or has committed the crime aggravated by the 
circumstance of reiteration; 

        (b) That he has previously escaped from legal confinement, 
evaded sentence, or violated the conditions of his bail without valid 
justification; 

        (c) That he committed the offense while under probation, parole, or conditional pardon;

        (d) That the circumstances of his case indicate the probability of flight if released on bail; or

        (e) That there is undue risk that he may commit another crime during the pendency of the appeal. 




 The appellate court may, 
motu proprio
 or on motion 
of any party, review the resolution of the Regional Trial Court after 
notice to the adverse party in either case. (5a) 




 
[44]

 SECTION 7. 
Capital Offense or an Offense Punishable by Reclusion Perpetua or Life Imprisonment, not Bailable
. â No person charged with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by 
reclusion perpetua

 or life imprisonment, shall be admitted to bail when evidence of guilt 
is strong, regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution. (7a)

[217]
 429 U.S. 97 (1976). In 
Estelle
,
 a prisoner was injured while unloading a bale of cotton from a truck. 
He filed a civil action for deprivation of rights against the Director 
of the Department of Corrections, the warden of the prison, and its 
medical doctors, alleging that the inadequate medical treatment 
subjected him to cruel and inhuman punishment. 

    The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the government's responsibility to
 provide medical care for its prisoners. Failure to do so may constitute
 a cause of action for cruel and inhuman punishment. First, however, the
 prisoner must allege "acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to 
evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs," which 
constitutes "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain" and in worst 
cases, "physical torture or a lingering death." Moreover, this 
deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs must be of
 such nature that offends the contemporary standards of decency as 
expressed in prison regulations. This means that not every accident or 
medical malpractice is sufficient. There must be a deliberate disregard 
of a prisoner's serious medical condition, delay, or complete denial of 
access to treatment, or intentional interference to a prescribed 
treatment.
        
 
[218]
 509 U.S. 25 (1993). In 
Helling
,
 the deliberate indifference test was dissected into its subjective and 
objective components. The prisoner filed a civil action for damages and 
injunction against various prison officials. Roomed with another 
prisoner who daily smoked five packs of cigarettes sold by the prison 
store, he raised health damage that constituted cruel and unusual 
punishment. 

    The U.S. Supreme Court held that the conditions of confinement are 
included in the scope of the right against cruel and unusual punishment.
 The reason is that in depriving liberty, the State renders prisoners 
unable to care for themselves. In a series of cases, the Court had 
categorically held that the protection against cruel and unusual 
punishment extends to "'sufficiently imminent dangers" such that a 
"remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic event." 

    While the Court affirmed that a cause of action exists under cruel 
and unusual punishment, the case was remanded to the trial courts to 
prove the objective and subjective components of such right. The 
objective factor consists of the prisoner's exposure to a grave risk 
that is not tolerated in the modern society. Moreover, the prisoner's 
exposure is of the nature that violates contemporary standards of 
decency. On the other hand, the subjective factor pertains to prison 
management showing deliberate indifference of the detention officers to 
the risks and exposure of the prisoner.

SEPARATE OPINION






"It is evident that the 
incredible overcrowding of the prison cells, that taxed facilities 
beyond measure and the starvation allowance often centavos per meal for 
each prisoner, must have rubbed raw the nerves and dispositions of the 
unfortunate inmates, and predisposed them to all sorts of violence to 
seize from their owners the meager supplies from outsider in order to 
take out their miserable existence. All this led inevitably to the 
formation of gangs that preyed like wolf packs on the weak, and 
ultimately to pitiless gang rivalry for the control of the prisoners, 
abetted by the inability of the outnumbered guards to enforce 
discipline, and which culminated in violent riots. The government cannot
 evade responsibility for keeping prisoners under such subhuman and 
dantesque conditions. Society must not close its eyes to the fact that 
if it has the right to exclude from its midst those who attack it, it 
has no right at all to confine them under circumstances that strangle 
all sense of decency, reduce convicts to the level of animals, and 
convert a prison term into prolonged torture and slow death."

CAGUIOA, 
J
.:


 I concur.
          
 The dystopian picture above that the Court refused to 
turn its gaze from was drawn over five decades ago, and yet the 
insufferable state of affairs in the penitentiary persists even today. 
So that although we, as a society, may have made dizzying advances in 
fields we consider of great consequence, because the least of us have 
continued to groan in unspeakable living conditions, and our detention 
facilities are constantly breaking at the seams, one must wonder how far
 we have truly come. Surely, we must have asked at one point if perhaps 
more than the deficient fiscal scaffolding and authoritative say-so, our
 institutions suffer the more destructive lack of empathy.
          
 This long-standing problem has been brought to the 
foreground by the current exigencies the country is facing, and the 
Court's decision to refer the instant petition to the concerned trial 
courts for the conduct of bail hearings and other proceedings is 
agreeably the better approach to take under the circumstances.
[2]

 While I agree that the Court cannot grant the petitioners' prayer for 
temporary release in the absence of a proper bail hearing, I also remain
 unconvinced that the Court, on its own, is powerless to protect the 
most vulnerable among us, especially those who cannot help themselves. 
Certainly in this case, the Court's mandate as the final and ultimate 
dispenser of justice must be more real than mere rhetoric. As proof of 
the Court's capacities, I write this Opinion to highlight the steps that
 the Court has already swiftly undertaken in response to the current 
pandemic. I also submit this Opinion to elaborate on my position and to 
expound on several issues raised by the petitioners, particularly the 
Court's equity jurisdiction, the propriety of using humanitarian 
considerations as a ground for the allowance of bail, and the invocation
 of the petitioners' rights under domestic and international law. This 
Opinion imagines that there may be no more opportune time for all 
material institutions to revisit their powers and awaken perceived 
apathies than now, with both historical underpinnings and the current 
crisis taking us all to task, by exposing once more that the unbearable 
conditions of persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) in our country is 
neither truly noticed nor new.
          
 
I.


 The instant 
Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 directly filed before this Court is essentially an application for bail or recognizance.
[3]
 The petitioners, who are allegedly political prisoners charged with crimes punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 and life imprisonment, seek their provisional release on bail or recognizance on the basis of humanitarian grounds. Citing 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
[4]
 (
Enrile
),
 the petitioners plead that the Court exercise its equity jurisdiction 
and grant them temporary liberty as their health conditions and 
continued incarceration make them highly vulnerable to COVID-19.
[5]


 
On the requirements for bail


 Bail is the security required and given for the 
release of a person in custody of the law to guarantee his appearance 
before the court as may be required under specified conditions.
[6]

 Recognizance, on the other hand, refers to "an obligation of record, 
entered into before some court or magistrate duly authorized to take it,
 with the condition to do some particular act, the most usual condition 
in criminal cases being the appearance of the accused for trial."
[7]

 If a person in custody or detention is unable to post bail due to 
abject poverty, he may be released on recognizance to the custody of a 
qualified member of the 
barangay
, city or municipality where the accused resides.
[8]


 Section 13, Article III of the Constitution states that all persons, 
except
 those charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 
when evidence of guilt is strong
,
 shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, or be 
released on recognizance as may be provided by law. As a corollary 
matter, Section 7, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court provides that 
regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution, no person charged 
with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment, shall be admitted to bail 
when evidence of guilt is strong
. Further, Republic Act No. (R.A.) 10389
[9]
 or the 
Recognizance Act of 2012
,
 states that the release on recognizance of any person in custody or 
detention for the commission of an offense is a matter of right when the
 offense is 
not
 punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment.
[10]


 Thus, before conviction, bail is either a matter of 
right or discretion. It is a matter of right when the offense charged is
 punishable by any penalty lower than 
reclusion perpetua
. However, bail becomes a matter of judicial discretion if the offense charged is punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment.
[11]

 The court's discretion is, however, limited only to determining whether
 or not the evidence of guilt is strong. Consequently, bail is to be 
granted if evidence of guilt is not strong, and denied if evidence of 
guilt is strong.
[12]


 In 
Obosa v. Court of Appeals
,
[13]
 the Court reiterated its pronouncement in 
De la Camara v. Enage
,
[14]

 on the purpose of bail and the rationale for denying the said relief to
 persons charged with capital offenses when the evidence of guilt is 
strong:
          


x x x Before conviction, every person is bailable except 
if charged with capital offenses when the evidence of guilt is strong. 
Such a right flows from the presumption of innocence in favor of every 
accused who should not be subjected to the loss of freedom as thereafter
 he would be entitled to acquittal, unless his guilt be proved beyond 
reasonable doubt. Thereby a regime of liberty is honored in the 
observance and not in the breach. It is not beyond the realm of 
probability, however, that a person charged with a crime, especially so 
where his defense is weak, would just simply make himself scarce and 
thus frustrate the hearing of his case. A bail is intended as a 
guarantee that such an intent would be thwarted. It is, in the language 
of Cooley, a 'mode short of confinement which would, with reasonable 
certainty, insure the attendance of the accused' for the subsequent 
trial. Nor is there anything unreasonable in denying this right to one 
charged with a capital offense when evidence of guilt is strong, as the 
likelihood is, rather than await the outcome of the proceeding against 
him with a death sentence, an ever-present threat, temptation to flee 
the jurisdiction would be too great to be resisted. x x x x
[15]
 (Italics omitted)



          In cases when bail is a matter of judicial discretion, the 
grant or denial thereof hinges on the singular issue of whether or not 
the evidence of guilt of the accused is strong.
[16]
 As observed in the Court's Decision,
[17]

 this necessarily requires the conduct of a bail hearing where the 
prosecution has the burden to prove that evidence of guilt is strong, 
subject to the right of the defense to cross-examine witnesses and 
introduce evidence in its own rebuttal.
[18]

 The Court cannot perform the aforementioned bail hearing because of the
 well-entrenched principle that it is not a trier of facts. The Court's 
jurisdiction is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been 
committed by the lower courts.
[19]

 The discretion to grant or deny bail is primarily lodged with the trial
 court judge who is mandated under the rules to: (1) conduct a summary 
hearing and receive the prosecution's evidence; and (2) provide, in its 
order granting or denying bail, a summary of the evidence for the 
prosecution and his own assessment thereof.
[20]


 As mentioned, the petitioners are all charged with offenses that are punishable by 
reclusion perpetua

 or life imprisonment. Thus, their entitlement to bail is clearly a 
matter of judicial discretion. However, there is no showing that any of 
them had applied for bail or that bail hearings were conducted to 
determine whether the evidence of guilt against them is strong. 
Nevertheless, aware of such absence of bail application or hearing, the 
petitioners have nonetheless proceeded directly to the Court praying for
 it to grant them temporary liberty through bail or recognizance based 
on humanitarian grounds, invoking the Court's equity jurisdiction. The 
petitioners cite the ruling of the Court in 
Enrile
 to support their cause.
          




On the invocation of the Court's equity jurisdiction
 






In order to properly invoke the Court's equity 
jurisdiction, the controlling test is whether or not a court of law is 
unable to adapt its judgments to the special circumstances of a case as a
 result of the inflexibility of its statutory or legal jurisdiction.
[21]

 Its aim is to enable the Court to rule on the basis of substantial 
justice in an instance when the prescribed or customary forms of 
ordinary law prove inadequate.
[22]


 In a number of cases, the Court has found equity 
jurisdiction as sufficient justification for the relaxation of rules in 
order to give way to substantial merit and justice. In the early case of
 
Catigbac v. Leyesa
,
[23]

 equity jurisdiction was invoked in affording a litigant with a remedy 
through an action that did not exist in the Code of Civil Procedure. The
 Court ruled that although the existing body of rules no longer provided
 for such an ancient action, such was deemed to have subsisted by virtue
 of a substantive right granted under Article 384 of the Civil Code. The
 Court there held that where there is a right, there is also a remedy, 
and equity jurisdiction steps in to scaffold the gap between the 
substantive right granted and a remedy that ensures that right.
[24]


 In the 1973 case of 
De los Reyes v. Ramolete
,
[25]

 involving the question of ownership over a disputed land between bona 
fide possessors on the one hand, and valid patent holders on the other, 
the Court found that equity jurisdiction could be used to "set matters 
right". Still, in the succeeding case of 
Serrano v. Court of Appeals
,
[26]

 which concerned the true nature of a purported contract of sale, the 
Court iterated that procedural rules are not to be applied rigidly at 
the expense of merit.
          
 Apart from cases of restitution, equity jurisdiction has also been invoked in criminal cases. In 
Curammeng v. People
,
[27]
 which involved an erroneous mode of appeal from a conviction, the Court ruled: 
          
 Nevertheless, if a rigid application of the 
rules of procedure will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader 
interests of justice in light of the prevailing circumstances of the 
case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are 
manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of 
the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. x x x
[28]


Further, in 
Daan v. Hon. Sandiganbayan (Fourth Division)
,
[29]

 where the accused therein was allowed to enter a plea bargain proposal 
pursuant to the higher interest of justice and fair play, the Court 
discussed the concept of equity as follows: 


 Equity as the complement of legal jurisdiction 
seeks to reach and do complete justice where courts of law, through the 
inflexibility of their rules and want of power to adapt their judgments 
to the special circumstances of cases, are incompetent so to do. Equity 
regards the spirit of and not the letter, the intent and not the form, 
the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is variously expressed
 by different courts.
[30]
 


 Even in extradition cases, the equity jurisdiction of the Court was invoked, as seen in 
Secretary of Justice v. Lantion
:
[31]


 We have ruled time and again that this 
Court's equity jurisdiction, which is aptly described as "justice 
outside legality," may be availed of only in the absence of, and never 
against, statutory law or judicial pronouncements (
Smith Bell & Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals
, 267 SCRA 530 [1997]; 
David-Chan vs. Court of Appeals
,
 268 SCRA 677 [1997]). The constitutional issue in the case at bar does 
not even call for "justice outside legality," since private respondent's
 due process rights, although not guaranteed by statute or by treaty, 
are protected by constitutional guarantees. We would not be true to the 
organic law of the land if we choose strict construction over guarantees
 against the deprivation of liberty. That would not be in keeping with 
the principles of democracy on which our Constitution is premised.
              
 Verily, as one traverses treacherous waters of 
conflicting and opposing currents of liberty and government authority, 
he must ever hold the oar of freedom in the stronger arm, lest an errant
 and wayward course be laid.
[32]




 
Ultimately, the Court's equity jurisdiction is found to
 be a sufficient justification for the relaxation of rules in order to 
give way to substantial merit of the case and the higher interest of 
justice.


 Indeed, the peculiar nature of the instant petition 
prays for both prompt and blanket relief to be applied to differentiated
 cases of the individual petitioners. Thus, while I recognize their plea
 to resolve the instant petition based on compassion and humanitarian 
considerations, the want of necessary factual details brought about by a
 proper bail hearing precludes this Court from a full calibration of 
each petitioner's eligibility for either release on bail or 
recognizance. 
          




On the applicability of the ruling in Enrile
 






In this regard, I agree with the position of some of my colleagues that the case of 
Enrile
 is inapplicable to the instant petition, though my reasoning differs.
[33]


 To recall, the Court in 
Enrile
 allowed therein 
petitioner to post bail on account of his advanced age and frail health â
 despite the fact that petitioner was charged with plunder and the 
absence of a proper hearing to determine whether the evidence of guilt 
against him is strong. This is inconsistent with the unambiguous 
Constitutional provision, which provides that a person shall not be 
entitled to bail if s/he is charged with an offense punishable, by 
reclusion perpetua
 when evidence of guilt is strong.
[34]
 Moreover, the same is contrary to established rules
[35]
 and settled jurisprudence
[36]

 on the necessity of a hearing for bail application when bail is 
discretionary. I was not yet part of the Court when the case was decided
 in 2015. Upon motion for its reconsideration however, being already a 
member of the Court, I voted to grant the motion and joined the dissent 
of Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen.
[37]


 Consistent with my dissent therein, it is my position that 
Enrile 
should
 not be considered as having set a precedent inasmuch as it has not 
since found favor in subsequent decisions by the Court,
[38]

 and the ruling by the majority therein does not find support in the 
Constitution and well-established rules and jurisprudence on bail 
proceedings. Hence, I agree with the position of Senior Associate 
Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe that the ruling in 
Enrile 
should be viewed as 
pro hac vice
 in light of the special and unique considerations accorded to petitioner therein.
[39]


 For the same reason above, I disagree with the suggestion during deliberations that 
Enrile

 laid down a two-step test to authorize the grant of bail when it is 
discretionary to do so: (a) the detainee will not be a flight risk or a 
danger to the community; and (b) there exist special, humanitarian and 
compelling circumstances.
[40]
 The ruling in 
Enrile

 deviates from entrenched legal principles concerning bail and it cannot
 be used to create doctrine for subsequent cases. To reiterate, 
petitioner therein was allowed to post bail even though he was charged 
with an offense punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
, without any 
showing through a hearing that the evidence of his guilt is not strong. 
Having skirted the minimum requirements under the Constitution regarding
 bail, the ruling in 
Enrile
 should not be used to set precedent for cases involving discretionary bail. 
          
 Moreover, the grant of bail in 
Enrile
 on the 
basis of petitioner's age and health rests on shaky ground as the 
circumstances therein were quite peculiar. As illustrated in Justice 
Leonen's Dissenting Opinion therein:  
          
 Neither was there grave abuse of discretion 
by the Sandiganbayan when it failed to release accused on bail for 
medical or humanitarian reasons. His release for medical and 
humanitarian reasons was not the basis for his prayer in his Motion to 
Fix Bail filed before the Sandiganbayan. Neither did he base his prayer 
for the grant of bail in this Petition on his medical condition.
              
 The grant of bail, therefore, by the majority is a 
special accommodation for petitioner. It is based on a ground never 
raised before the Sandiganbayan or in the pleadings filed before this 
court. The Sandiganbayan should not be faulted for not shedding their 
neutrality and impartiality. It is not the duty of an impartial court to
 find what it deems a better argument for the accused at the expense of 
the prosecution and the people they represent. 
              
 The allegation that petitioner suffers from 
medical conditions that require very special treatment is a question of 
fact. We cannot take judicial notice of the truth contained in a 
certification coming from one doctor. This doctor has to be presented as
 an expert witness who will be subjected to both direct and 
cross-examination so that he can properly manifest to the court the 
physical basis for his inferences as well as the nature of the medical 
condition of petitioner. Rebutting evidence that may be presented by the
 prosecution should also be considered. All this would be proper before 
the Sandiganbayan. Again, none of this was considered by the 
Sandiganbayan because petitioner insisted that he was entitled to bail 
as a matter of right on grounds other than his medical condition.   
              
 Furthermore, the majority's opinionâother than the
 invocation of a general human rights principleâdoes not provide clear 
legal basis for the grant of bail on humanitarian grounds. Bail for 
humanitarian considerations is neither presently provided in our Rules 
of Court nor found in any statute or provision of the Constitution. 


 This case leaves this court open to a justifiable 
criticism of granting a privilege ad hoc: only for one personâpetitioner
 in this case. 


 Worse, it puts pressure on all trial courts and the 
Sandiganbayan that will predictably be deluged with motions to fix bail 
on the basis of humanitarian considerations. The lower courts will have 
to decide, without guidance, whether bail should be granted because of 
advanced age, hypertension, pneumonia, or dreaded diseases. They will 
have to decide whether this is applicable only to Senators and former 
Presidents charged with plunder and not to those accused of drug 
trafficking, multiple incestuous rape, serious illegal detention, and 
other crimes punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 or life 
imprisonment. They will have to decide whether this is applicable only 
to those who are in special detention facilities and not to the aging or
 sick detainees in overcrowded detention facilities all over this 
country. 


 Our trial courts and the Sandiganbayan will decide on 
the basis of personal discretion causing petitions for certiorari to be 
filed before this court. This will usher in an era of truly selective 
justice not based on clear legal provisions, but one that is 
unpredictable, partial, and solely grounded on the presence or absence 
of human compassion on the day that justices of this court deliberate 
and vote.
[41]
 




 Ergo, a reading of the ruling in 
Enrile
 shows that 
there is no discernible standard for the courts to decide cases 
involving discretionary bail on the basis of humanitarian 
considerations. The ineluctable conclusion, as opined by Justice Leonen,
[42]
 is that the grant of bail by the majority in 
Enrile
 was a special accommodation for petitioner therein. Thus, at the risk of being repetitious, the ruling in 
Enrile
 should be considered as a stray decision and, echoing Justice Bernabe,
[43]
 must likewise be considered as 
pro hac vice
.
 It should not be used as the benchmark in deciding cases involving the 
question on whether bail may be allowed on the basis of humanitarian 
considerations. Notably, under the Rules of Court, humanitarian 
considerations such as age and health are only taken into account in 
fixing the bail amount after a determination that evidence of guilt 
against the accused is not strong.
[44]


 However, the petitioners are not left without any other recourse that is legally permissible. Despite the inapplicability of 
Enrile

 and in view of the novel nature of this case, the Court should not be 
precluded from affording the petitioners the appropriate reliefs within 
the bounds of law.
          
 In this regard, a proper bail hearing before the trial
 court should first be conducted to determine whether the evidence of 
guilt against the petitioners is strong. This Court, not being a trier 
of facts, cannot receive and weigh the petitioners' evidence at the 
first instance. Factual and evidentiary matters must first be threshed 
out in a proper bail hearing, which may only be done in the lower 
courts. Trial courts are better equipped to assess the petitioners' 
entitlement to bail or recognizance based on the provisions of the 
Constitution, the relevant laws, and the Rules of Court.
          
 Thus, instead of dismissing the petition outright, I 
agree with the Court's ruling to refer this petition to the concerned 
trial courts.
[45]
 Exigency is 
better served if the trial courts where the criminal cases of the 
petitioners are respectively pending will hear their bail petitions and 
receive their evidence. 
          




 II. 




 All persons are guaranteed the right to life. This is 
constitutionally enshrined under Section 1, Article III of the 
Constitution, 
to wit
:  
          
 SECTION 1. No person shall be deprived of 
life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any 
person be denied the equal protection of the laws. 


 More importantly, the right to life, being grounded on natural law, is inherent
[46]

 and, therefore, not a creation of, or dependent upon a particular law, 
custom, or belief. It precedes and transcends any authority or the laws 
of men.
[47]
 Its protection is guaranteed notwithstanding one's status; neither is this right forfeited by detention or incarceration. 
          
 Necessarily included in the right to life are the 
State policies found in Sections 11 and 15, Article II of the 
Constitution, which state:  
          
 SECTION 11. The State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights.
              
 x x x x 
              
 SECTION 15. The State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. 
              



          The above core principles in our Constitution mirror those 
found in several international laws, prominent of which is the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights
[48]
 (UDHR) stating that:
          
 Article 1. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. x x x
              
 x x x x
              
 Article 3. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
              
 x x x x 
              
 Article 25. (1) Everyone has the right to a 
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and
 of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and 
necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of 
unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of 
livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.            
          


 Meanwhile, the right to health is included in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),
[49]

 which obliges state parties to recognize the "right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health."
[50]
 The Philippines signed and ratified the ICESCR,
[51]
 which makes it a binding obligation on the part of the government.
          
 These rights do not discriminate between offenders and
 non-offenders as it is the declared policy of the State under the 1987 
Constitution to value "every human person."
[52]

 Similarly, the UDHR recognizes that all persons are entitled to all the
 rights and freedoms set forth therein, "without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."
[53]


 Thus, the notion that persons deprived of liberty 
(PDLs) are not entitled to the guarantee of basic human rights should be
 disabused. While they do not enjoy the same latitude of rights as 
certain restrictions on their liberty and property are imposed as a 
consequence of their detention or imprisonment, the foregoing 
international covenants and our own Constitution prove that PDLs do not 
shed their human rights once they are arrested, charged, placed under 
the custody of law, and subsequently convicted and incarcerated. The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),
[54]
 in particular, to which the Philippines is likewise a party,
[55]
 positively requires the treatment of PDLs "with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person."
[56]


 Our laws governing arrest and custodial investigation also do not deviate from the above principles. R.A. 7438,
[57]

 otherwise known as the "Custodial Investigation Law of 1992," was 
created pursuant to the State policy of valuing the "dignity of every 
human being"
[58]
 and guaranteeing "full respect for human rights."
[59]

 It defines the positive rights of all persons under custodial 
investigation, and outlines the concomitant duties of arresting, 
detaining or investigating officers to secure said rights, which include
 the detained person's right to be assisted by counsel. In addition, 
R.A. 9745,
[60]
 otherwise known
 as the "Anti-Torture Act of 2009" outlaws, foremost, any act that 
subjects people held in custody to any form of physical, psychological 
or mental harm, force, violence, threat or intimidation or any other act
 which degrades human dignity.
[61]

 Finally, Article 32 of the New Civil Code enumerates the rights and 
liberties of all persons, several of which pertain to the rights of the 
accused, and includes the freedom from excessive fines or cruel and 
unusual punishment.
[62]
 Article 32 further provides that the impeding or impairment of these rights shall be under pains of damages.
          
 When a person is detained or imprisoned, the person is
 afforded certain fundamental rights that affirmatively remain in effect
 throughout the entire period of incarceration. These rights spring from
 Section 19, Article III of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, 
which proscribes the infliction of cruel, degrading or inhuman 
punishment and the employment of physical, psychological, or degrading 
punishment against any prisoner or detainee. It likewise affirms that 
the use of substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman 
conditions shall be dealt with by law. Notably, both the UDHR
[63]
 and the ICCPR
[64]
 have similar prohibitions against the employment of cruel, degrading, or inhuman punishment.
          
 Associate Justice Edgardo L. Delos Santos, however, 
opines that the Constitutional proscription against cruel, degrading or 
inhuman punishment is limited in application and may only be invoked to 
invalidate a law that imposes such penalty, but "not to recognize a 
substantive right."
[65]
 
Furthermore, he surmises from the deliberations that, as Section 19, 
Article III is currently worded, it is only the legislature that has the
 authority to deal with substandard or inadequate penal facilities.
[66]
 I respectfully differ.
          
 Preliminarily, while I agree with how Justice Delos 
Santos presented the evolution of Section 19, Article III, showing how 
the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission manifested an 
original intention to only protect against "law[s] which [impose] a 
penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman,"
[67]
 it is clear from the exchanges that this original intention was expanded. 
          
 In particular, Commissioner Teodulo C. Natividad 
passionately argued that the provision should contemplate the abatement 
of inhuman conditions in prison facilities. The following exchanges, 
likewise quoted in Justice Delos Santos' opinion,
[68]

 demonstrate the accommodation of Commissioner Natividad's proposition 
that the gross inadequacy of the prison facilities constitutes an 
impairment of this constitutional right:  
          
 MR. NATIVIDAD. May I go on to Section 22 
which says: "Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel, degrading 
or inhuman punishment, or the death penalty inflicted." I will not deal 
with the death penalty because it has already been belabored in many 
remarks. In due time, perhaps I will be given a chance to say a few 
words on that, too. But I am referring to cruel, degrading and inhuman 
punishment. I am drawing upon my experience as the Chairman of the 
National Police Commission for many years. As Chairman of the National 
Police Commission, the same way that General de Castro here was, one of 
my duties was to effect the inspection of jails all over the country. We
 must admit that our jails are a shame to our race. Once we were invited
 by the United Nations' expert on penology â I do not remember his name,
 but he is a doctor friend of mine â and he reported back to us that our
 jails are penological monstrosities.
              
 Here in the cities, 85 percent are detention prisoners
 and only 15 percent are convicted prisoners. But if we visit the jails,
 they are so crowded and the conditions are so subhuman that one-half of
 the inmates lie down on the cold cement floor which is usually wet, 
even in summer. One-half of them sleep while the other half sit up to 
wait, until the other half wake up, so that they can also sleep. In the 
toilets, right beside the bowl, there are people sleeping. I visited the
 prisons and that was the time I fought for the Adult Probation Law 
because I remember what Winston Churchill and the criminologist 
Dostoevski said: "If you want to know the level of civilization of a 
country, all you have to do is visit their jails." In jurisprudence, the
 interpretation of "cruel and unusual punishment" in the United States 
Constitution was made by the Supreme Court when it said, and I quote: 
"Interpretation of the Eight Amendment in the phrase 'cruel and unusual 
punishment,' must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of 
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Courts in the 
United States in 10 landmark cases â some of these I would like to 
mention in passing: 
Halt v. Sarver, Jackson v. Bishop, Jackson v. Handrick, Jordan v. Fitzharris and Rockly v. Stanley
 â stated that subhuman conditions in a prison is an unconstitutional imposition of cruel and unusual punishment. 
              
 
I would just like to â even without an 
amendment â convince the Committee that if a prison is subhuman and it 
practices beatings and extended isolation of prisoners, and has sleeping
 cells which are extremely filthy and unsanitary, these conditions 
should be included in the concept of "cruel and inhuman punishment."

 Even without amendment but with this concept, I would like to encourage
 the legislature to give higher priority to the upliftment of our jails 
and for the judiciary to act because the judiciary in 
habeas corpus 
proceedings
 freed some prisoners. So, by means of injunction, the courts stopped 
these practices which are inimical to the constitutional rights of 
inmates. On the part of the executive, it initiated reforms in order 
that the jails can be more humane and fair. 
If this concept of "cruel
 and inhuman punishment" can be accepted, Mr. Presiding Officer, I may 
not even ask for an amendment so that in the future, the judiciary, the 
executive and the legislative can give more remedial measures to this 
festering problem of subhuman conditions in our jails and prisons.


 I submit, Mr. Presiding Officer. 
              
 FR. BERNAS. Mr. Presiding Officer, although I 
would say that the description of the situation is something that is 
inhuman, I wonder if it fits into the purpose of Section 22. The purpose
 of Section 22 is to provide a norm for invalidating a penalty that is 
imposed by law. Let us say that thieves should be punished by 
imprisonment in a filthy prison, that would be "cruel and unusual 
punishment." But if the law simply say that thieves should be punished 
by imprisonment, that by itself does not say that it is cruel. So, it 
does not invalidate the penal law. So my own thinking is that what the 
Gentleman has in mind would be something more proper, even for ordinary 
legislation or, if at all, for Section 21. 
              
 MR. NATIVIDAD. The Gentleman said that he is not 
going to sentence him in a filthy prison. Of course not. But this is 
brought out in the petition for 
habeas corpus
 or for injunction. This is revealed in a proper petition. 
              
 FR. BERNAS. I agree with the Commissioner, but as I
 said, the purpose of Section 22 is to invalidate the law itself which 
imposes a penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman. That is the 
purpose of this law. The Commissioner's purpose is different. 
              
 
MR. NATIVIDAD. My purpose is to abate the 
inhuman treatment, and thus give spirit and meaning to the banning of 
cruel and inhuman punishment. 
In the United States, if the prison is
 declared unconstitutional, and what is enforced is an unconstitutional 
punishment, the courts, because of that interpretation of what is cruel 
and inhuman, may impose conditions to improve the prison; free the 
prisoners from jail; transfer all prisoners; close the prison; or may 
refuse to send prisoners to the jail.
              
 FR. BERNAS. 
We would await the formulation of the Commissioner's amendment.


 MR. NATIVIDAD. 
So, in effect, it is abating the continuance of the imposition of a cruel and inhuman punishment.

 I believe we have to start somewhere in giving hope to a big segment of
 our population who are helplessly caught in a trap. Even the detention 
prisoners, 85 percent of whom are jailed in the metropolitan area, are 
not convicted prisoners, and yet although not convicted in court, they 
are being made to suffer this cruel and inhuman punishment. I am saying 
this in their behalf, because as Chairman of the National Police 
Commission for so many years, it was my duty to send my investigators to
 chronicle the conditions in these jails day by day. I wrote letters to 
the President asking for his help, as well as to the Batasan, but there 
was no reply. 
              
 Finally, I am now here in this Commission, and I 
am writing this letter through the Chairman of this Committee. I hope it
 will be answered. 
              
 FR. BERNAS. 
Mr. Presiding Officer, as I said, 
we have no quarrel whatsoever with the objective. We will await the 
formulation of the amendment.


 MR. NATIVIDAD. Thank you.
[69]
 (Emphasis supplied)           
          


When Commissioner Regalado E. Maambong posed the same 
concern as Commissioner Natividad, Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas again agreed 
that the formulation of the provision may be amended to integrate the 
protection being sought, 
viz
.: 


 MR. MAAMBONG. Yes, so that I do not have to waste
 the time of the body and the Committee, considering that the Committee 
has understood our purpose, perhaps the Committee could help by giving 
us just one section to be inserted there or one sentence or one phrase 
which would satisfy the requirements that we have presented, 
considering
 that in the United States, circumstances of this nature which happen 
inside the jail are considered under the provisions and jurisprudence of
 the United States as cruel and unusual punishment. Probably, we can 
have a parallel provision along that line and I hope the Committee will 
help.
 Would that be all right?
              
 FR. BERNAS. 
Yes. And I thought the Gentleman already has the formula which we can discuss.


 THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon). The Floor Leader is recognized.
              
 MR. MAAMBONG. So, we reserve our right to insert something here in coordination with the Committee.
              
 Thank you very much.
[70]
 (Emphasis supplied)            
          


 During the period of amendments, several points were 
raised, including letting the legislature define the concept of 
substandard or inadequate facilities: 
          


 FR. BERNAS. 
This is more of a command to the State 
saying that beyond having recognized these things as prohibited, the 
State should do something to remedy whatever may be a violation.
 


 x x x x


 FR. BERNAS. If we add the word "GROSSLY," we are almost saying that the legislature should act only if the situation is gross.


 MR. REGALADO. How do we determine what is substandard?


 FR. BERNAS. We leave that to the legislature. What I am 
saying is that the legislature could say: "Well, this is substandard but
 it is not grossly substandard; therefore, we need not do anything about
 it."


 MR. REGALADO. Could we have a happy compromise on how 
the substandard categorization could come in because it may be 
substandard from the standpoint of American models, but it may be 
sufficient for us?


 FR. BERNAS. I do not think we should go into great details on this. We are not legislating . . .


 MR. REGALADO. So, the sponsor's position is that we just
 leave it to the legislature to have a legislative standard of their own
 in the form of an ordinary legislation?


 FR. BERNAS. Yes.

 MR. RODRIGO. I would like to call attention to the fact 
that the word "DEGRADING" is already in the first sentence of this 
section: "Excessive fine shall not be imposed nor cruel, degrading or 
inhuman punishment inflicted." So, why repeat the word "DEGRADING"?


 FR. BERNAS. Precisely, Madam President, yesterday, we 
said that the provision we have in the present Constitution has 
reference to the punishment that is prescribed by the law itself; 
whereas what we are dealing with here is the punishment or condition 
which is actually being practised. In other words, we are, in the 
present Constitution, talking about punishment which, if imposed by the 
law, renders the law invalid.


 
In this paragraph, we are describing conditions of 
detainees who may be held under valid laws but are being treated in a 
manner that is subhuman or degrading. 


 x x x x


 MR. FOZ. May I just ask one question of the proponent of
 the amendment. I get it that the law shall provide penalties for the 
conditions described by his amendment. 


 MR. MAAMBONG. In line with the decisions of the Supreme 
Court on the interpretation of cruel and unusual punishments, there may 
be a law which punishes this violation precisely or there may not be a 
law. 
What could happen is that the law could provide for some reliefs other than penalties.
 


 
In the United States, there are what is known as 
injunctive or declaratory reliefs and that is not exactly in the form of
 a penalty. But I am not saying that the legislature is prevented from 
passing a law which will inflict punishment for violations of this 
section.
 


 MR. FOZ. In case the law passed by the legislature would
 impose sanctions, not so much in the case of the first part of the 
amendment but in the case of the second part with regard to substandard 
or outmoded legal penal facilities characterized by degrading 
surroundings and insanitary or subhuman conditions, on whom should such 
sanctions be applied? 


 MR. MAAMBONG. It would have to be applied on the 
administrators of that penal institution. In the United States, in my 
reading of the cases furnished to me by Commissioner Natividad, there 
are instances where the law or the courts themselves ordered the closure
 of a penal institution and, in extreme cases, in some states, they even
 set the prisoners free for violations of such a provision. 


 MR. FOZ. I am concerned about the features described as 
substandard or outmoded penal facilities characterized by degrading 
surroundings, because we know very well the conditions in our jails, 
particularly in the local jails. It is not really the fault of those in 
charge of the jails but these conditions are the result of lack of funds
 and the support by local government, in the first instance, and by the 
national government. 


 Does the Gentleman think we should penalize the jailers for outmoded penal facilities? 


 MR. MAAMBONG. No, Madam President. 
What we are trying
 to say is that lack of funds is a very convenient alibi for the State, 
and I think with these provisions, the State should do something about 
it.
 


MR. FOZ. Thank you, Madam President.


 FR. BERNAS. 
Madam President, we are not telling the legislature what to do; we are just telling them that they should do something about it.


 MR. DE CASTRO. Madam President.


 THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner de Castro is recognized.


 MR. DE CASTRO. Thank you.


 The provision which says: "The employment of PHYSICAL, 
psychological OR DEGRADING PUNISHMENT against ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE 
SHALL be dealt with BY LAW" is already provided for by our present laws.
 We already have laws against third-degree punishments or even 
psychological punishments. Do we still need this provision?


 Thank you. Madam President.


 MR. MAAMBONG. 
As I was saying, Madam President, the law need not penalize; the law may only put in corrective measures as a remedy.


 MR. REGALADO. Madam President.


 THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Regalado is recognized.


 MR. REGALADO. May I just rejoin the statement of 
Commissioner de Castro that we have laws already covering situations 
like this. The law we have on that in the Revised Penal Code is 
maltreatment of prisoners which comes from the original text 
maltratos de los encarcerados
. That presupposes that the prisoner is incarcerated. 


 The proposed legislation sought here will apply not only
 to incarcerated prisoners, but also to other detainees who, although 
not incarcerated, are nevertheless kept, their liberty of movement is 
controlled before incarceration. So, this is for the legislature to fill
 that void in the law.
[71]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
          


 The foregoing exchanges, in my view, belie a restrictive 
interpretation that severely limits the application of Section 19, 
Article III. What is apparent instead is that the Framers reached a 
consensus on three important points: 
first
, that the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions 
constitutes cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment and shall be dealt 
with by legislation; 
second
, that the said subhuman conditions during detention may be appreciated for 
both
 PDLs under preventive detention, and PDLs who are detained after conviction; and 
third
, the State has the positive duty to undertake measures for the improvement of these conditions. 
          
 Justice Delos Santos makes much of the fact that the 
second paragraph of Section 19, Article III contains the phrase "shall 
be dealt with by law," thus advancing the view that the Framers intended
 to leave to Congress the authority of determining the conditions for 
substandard or inhuman prison facilities and of providing penalties 
therefor.
[72]
 It bears 
emphasis, however, that both Commissioners Natividad and Maambong 
referred to the United States (US) Supreme Court's interpretation of the
 Eighth Amendment
[73]
 in their Constitution, which similarly proscribes the infliction of cruel and inhuman punishment. 
          
 Indeed, the US Supreme Court ruled in 
Estelle v. Gamble
[74]
 (
Estelle
)
 that the Eighth Amendment, which traditionally proscribes physically 
barbarous punishments, should extend to the provision of adequate 
medical care to PDLs. The US Supreme Court, in effect, acknowledged the 
positive obligation of the State over PDLs in its custody, 
to wit
: 
          


Our more recent cases, however, have held that the 
Amendment proscribes more than physically barbarous punishments. x x x 
The Amendment embodies "broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, 
civilized standards, humanity, and decency . . . ," x x x against which 
we must evaluate penal measures. Thus, we have held repugnant to the 
Eighth Amendment punishments which are incompatible with "the evolving 
standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society," x x 
x. 


 
These elementary principles establish the 
government's obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is 
punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to
 treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs 
will not be met. In the worst cases, such a failure may actually produce
 physical "torture or a lingering death," x x x the evils of most 
immediate concern to the drafters of the Amendment. In less serious 
cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which no 
one suggests would serve any penological purpose. x x x The infliction 
of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary 
standards of decency as manifested in modern legislation codifying the 
common law view that "it is but just that the public be required to care
 for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his 
liberty, care for himself."
[75]
 (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)        
          


 Thus, while torture is the ordinary and usual 
contemplation of cruel and inhuman punishment, the deliberations of the 
1986 Constitutional Commission reveal the explicit intention of the 
Framers to depart from or expand the understanding of this convention. 
For this reason, the Framers clearly agreed to extend the guarantee in 
Section 19, Article III for the protection against the employment of 
substandard prison facilities. That this "shall be dealt with by law" is
 an exhortation to the government â not only the legislature â to create
 or otherwise ensure humane conditions for PDLs during their 
incarceration. It is not a condition for Section 19 to operate.
[76]


 In this regard, if the penal institutions are so 
grossly inadequate, there is a culpable omission on the part of the 
State to observe an affirmative obligation under the Constitution. 
Section 19, Article III may therefore be invoked to grant reliefs not 
only when, as suggested by some members, there is "flagrant or 
intentional infliction of pain or suffering,"
[77]
 
but also when the conditions of incarceration are neglected to such a degree that the punishment becomes cruel and excessive
. 
          
 It is also worth repeating, as cited by Justice Delos 
Santos, that as early as 1986, the Framers had wrestled with the means 
with which this deplorable situation of PDLs can be redressed. Over 
three decades ago, there was already an acute sense of failure of the 
detention system of the country, with one soberly recognizing that our 
detention facilities were "penological monstrosities"
[78]
 and another calling for an uplifting of the detention conditions to a "level of constitutional tolerability."
[79]


 The above discussion only goes to show that the 
Framers neither intended to preclude individuals, such as the 
petitioners, from invoking the right under Section 19, Article III to 
obtain redress for their grievances, nor designed to foreclose any 
complementary action on the part of the Court or the Executive. In fact,
 a more circumspect consideration of the material deliberations draws a 
conceptualization of Section 19, Article III that is far from static, 
but is instead dynamic, and constantly attuned to the moral moorings and
 convictions of the times. In 
Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice
,
[80]

 which Justice Delos Santos likewise cites positively, the Court 
significantly held that "[w]hat is cruel and unusual 'is not fastened to
 the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes 
enlightened by a humane justice' and 'must draw its meaning from the 
evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing 
society.'"
[81]


 Against this backdrop, therefore, it is most difficult
 to surmise that during the Framers' deliberations, Section 19, Article 
III was conceived with the idea of minimizing its enforceability, or 
confining its remedial curative measures only to the Executive and the 
Legislative branches. If at all, it is perhaps even reasonably 
discernible that the appreciation of the severity of the condition in 
the detention facilities tilted the arc of the provision towards 
enabling 
all three branches of the government
 to be able to move within its powers to remedy the appalling conditions suffered by PDLs under custody. 
          
 Of equal import, Commissioner Maambong remarked that 
"the law need not penalize; the law may only put in corrective measures 
as a remedy."
[82]
 As I have 
already mentioned, there are laws already in place to protect the rights
 of PDLs against the employment of cruel, degrading, and inhuman 
punishment, from the moment of custodial investigation until the service
 of their sentence. R.A. 7438 and R.A. 9745 provide for penalties, while
 Article 32 of the Civil Code grants PDLs a recourse to collect damages 
in cases of violations of their rights. 
          
 Verily, the Constitutional rights afforded to PDLs 
create corresponding duties on the part of the State to protect and 
promote them. In line with this, it is noteworthy that as early as 1955,
 the UN adopted the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners (UNSMRTP), which constituted the universally acknowledged 
minimum standards for the management of prison facilities and the 
treatment of prisoners.
[83]
 
While these rules were merely recommendatory, they have been of 
tremendous value and influence in the development of prison laws, 
policies and practices in Member States all over the world.
[84]
 The UNSMRTP was subsequently revised in 2015 into what is now known as the 
Nelson Mandela Rules
. The recent revision took into consideration the development of other international law instruments on human rights.
[85]


 The UNSMRTP and the 
Nelson Mandela Rules 
were 
concretized and situated within the sphere of the national experience 
mainly through the enabling laws of the two main agencies in charge of 
the country's prison system, namely the Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology (BJMP) and the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor). These enabling 
laws contain the very corrective measures, as Commissioner Maambong 
adverted to during the deliberations, which seek to address the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions. 
          
 The BuCor's enabling statute, R.A. 10575,
[86]

 explicitly declares as a policy the promotion of the general welfare 
and the safeguarding of prisoners' rights in the national penitentiary.
[87]

 For this purpose, R.A. 10575 vests the BuCor with the mandate of 
safekeeping national inmates, by ensuring the "decent provision of 
quarters, food, water and clothing 
in compliance with established United Nations standards
."
[88]

 Repeated references to the UNSMRTP are also made in its Revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (Revised IRR). Section 2 of said 
Revised IRR echoes the declaration of policy in the BuCor's enabling 
act, further stating that the basic rights of every prisoner should be 
safeguarded by, among other things, "creating an environment conducive 
to [the] rehabilitation [of prisoners] and compliant with the 
[UNSMRTP]." This section quotes the concept of imprisonment, in 
particular, as stated in Rule 57 of the UNSMRTP,
[89]
 
to wit
:
          


Imprisonment and other measures which result in cutting 
off an offender from the outside world are afflictive by the very fact 
of taking from the person the right of self-determination by depriving 
him of his liberty. Therefore 
the prison system shall not, except as 
incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, 
aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situation.
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The definition of safekeeping in the Revised IRR also 
expounded that the basic needs which PDLs must be provided with comprise
 of "
habitable quarters
, food, water, clothing, and 
medical care
, 
in compliance with the established UNSMRTP
, and consistent with restoring the dignity of every inmate and guaranteeing full respect for human rights."
[90]

 It is likewise stated that the core objective of "according the dignity
 of man" to inmates while serving sentence is in accordance with the 
following provisions of the UNSMRTP:
[91]


 60. (1) 
The regime of the institution 
should seek to minimize any differences between prison life and life at 
liberty which tend to lessen the responsibility of the prisoners or the 
respect due to their dignity as human beings. 


 (2) Before the completion of the sentence, it is 
desirable that the necessary steps be taken to ensure for the prisoner a
 gradual return to life in society. This aim may be achieved, depending 
on the case, by a pre-release regime organized in the same institution 
or in another appropriate institution, or by release on trial under some
 kind of supervision which must not be entrusted to the police but 
should be combined with effective social aid.
[92]
 (Emphasis supplied)          
          

          The enabling statute of the BJMP,
[93]

 on the other hand, mandates a secure, clean, adequately equipped, and 
sanitary jail in every district, city and municipality, for the custody 
and safekeeping of detainees.
[94]
 The mission of the BJMP is to enhance jail management by formulating policies and guidelines on 
humane safekeeping
 of inmates and ensuring their compliance in all district, city and municipal jails.
[95]

 One of its objectives is to ensure that the BJMP complies with the 
principles in the different international instruments relative to the 
humane treatment of inmates.
[96]
 The BJMP likewise endeavors to improve the living conditions of offenders 
in accordance with the accepted standards set by the United Nations
.
[97]


 In the BJMP Operations Manual, what especially stands out 
are the provisions on the handling and safekeeping of inmates with 
special needs. Included herein are inmates who are pregnant,
[98]
 senior citizens,
[99]
 and infirm.
[100]

 Section 43 also significantly provides that emergency plans for both 
natural and man-made calamities and other forms of jail disturbances 
shall be formulated to suit the physical structure and other factors 
peculiar to every jail. An epidemic is among the enumerated examples of a
 natural calamity. 
          
 These laws affirm the State's duty of safekeeping 
PDLs, as carried out by the BuCor and BJMP, in relation to the 
constitutional proscription against cruel and inhumane punishment, and 
substandard conditions for penal facilities. At the same time, what may 
not be divorced from this proscription is the duty to protect the health
 of PDLs while incarcerated, and ultimately, realize their right to 
life,
[101]
 both fundamental rights â as I have stressed previously â which PDLs do not forfeit upon arrest and detention. 
          
 As it stands, therefore, the right to health, as a "component to the right to life,"
[102]

 is inextricably linked with the guarantees under Section 19, Article 
III, of the Constitution, which are self-executing provisions and, as 
such, are judicially enforceable. 
          
 Apart from the domestic laws earlier mentioned, the 
more relevant consideration is that the enabling statutes of the BuCor 
and the BJMP have expressly adopted the standards set by the UN for the 
safekeeping of PDLs. There is no question, therefore, that included 
herein are the universally accepted minimum standards set by the Nelson 
Mandela Rules. The BuCor's enabling law, in particular, has explicitly 
referred thereto. 
Consequently, notwithstanding the non-binding and recommendatory nature of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules
, they have effectively been transformed as part of the law of the land
.
          
 Furthermore, flowing from the right to health 
guaranteed by ICESCR, PDLs cannot be discriminated upon when it comes to
 access to health facilities and services.
[103]

 They are entitled to receive the same standard of care normally 
available to those not incarcerated. This is referred to as the 
principle of "equivalence of care,"
[104]

 initially adopted by the UN in General Assembly Resolution 37/194, 
which declared principles for the role of physicians in protecting PDLs 
against torture and cruel or degrading punishment:  
          
 Principle 1
              
 Health personnel, particularly physicians, charged 
with the medical care of prisoners and detainees have a duty to provide 
them with protection of their physical and mental health and treatment 
of disease of 
the same quality and standard as is afforded to those who are not imprisoned or detained.
[105]
 (Emphasis supplied)           
          


 This was further echoed in Rule 24 of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules
, which states that: 
          


1. The provision of health care for prisoners is a State responsibility. 
Prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community
,
 and should have access to necessary health-care services free of charge
 without discrimination on the grounds of their legal status. 


2. Health-care services should be organized in close 
relationship to the general public health administration and in a way 
that ensures continuity of treatment and care, including for HIV, 
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, as well as for drug 
dependence. (Emphasis supplied) 




 It is interesting to note that under the BuCor Operating 
Manual, there is an evident adherence to the principle of equivalence 
and non-discrimination, which is apparent in the following provision:  
          

    Part V
      
 Rehabilitation and Treatment of Inmates

 SECTION 2. 
Health Services
. â Health care and services shall be given to inmates 
similar to those available in the free community

 and subject to prison regulations. A prison shall have at least one 
qualified medical doctor and a dentist. (Emphasis supplied)         
          


 Guided by the principle of equivalence of care, the 
petitioners and all other PDLs are entitled to the same safeguards 
against illnesses that are available to those not incarcerated. But 
considering the present state of our penal facilities, and in light of 
the gravity of the present pandemic, the fulfillment of the minimum 
standards for the safekeeping and health of PDLs has taken on a new 
sense of urgency. 
          
 The problem with congestion within our penal 
facilities is no longer a disputable matter. The New Bilibid Prison 
alone reportedly has a 353% congestion rate.
[106]

 The acuteness of the consequences of overcrowded jails and prisons, 
however, has been sharpened by the highly infectious nature of COVID-19.
 The Court can take judicial notice of the precautions published by the 
World Health Organization on the import of social distancing and 
self-isolation as effective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
[107]

 But given the notorious conditions within prison walls, these 
recommended measures intended for the protection of the health and 
safety of PDLs may well be unattainable. The respondents themselves, in 
their Comment, admitted to the near impossibility of adhering to these 
measures.
[108]
 In the context 
of the present global pandemic, therefore, the interwoven rights of PDLs
 run the risk of being impaired. And, while it might be true that 
respondents have taken steps to address and contain the spread of 
COVID-19 among the inmates, these measures may be easily negated by the 
congestion of prison facilities, which render PDLs vulnerable to the 
risk of contracting the virus. 
          
 If the causal link between PDLs' poor health and 
exclusion from standards of care available to free individuals, on the 
one hand, and the fact of facility congestion on the other, are both 
sufficiently established, such may give rise to an actionable claim 
based on the violation of the proscription against cruel and inhuman 
punishment, and the State's commitment to various international law 
instruments. Such a claim may be demonstrably supported by a showing 
that within the present configuration of the prison systems, PDLs are 
deprived of the means to practice standard protocols to ensure their 
health, including even the simplest ones such as physical distancing and
 self-isolation. 
          
 In the case of 
Helling v. McKinney
[109]
 (
Helling
),
 the US Supreme Court was confronted with the question of whether a 
prison inmate's health risk as a result of involuntary exposure to 
environmental tobacco smoke in the Nevada State prison was a proper 
basis for a claim under the Eighth Amendment. The US Supreme Court held 
that denial of a remedy for such health risk exposure was tantamount to 
deliberate indifference in the contemplation of
 Estelle
 and further rejected the proposition that only deliberate indifference to serious health problems was actionable, 
viz
.: 
          


We have great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities
 may not be deliberately indifferent to an inmate's current health 
problems but may ignore a condition of confinement 
that is sure 
or very likely
 to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year
. In 
Hutto v. Finney
,
 437 U. S. 678, 682 (1978), we noted that inmates in punitive isolation 
were crowded into cells and that some of them had infectious maladies 
such as hepatitis and venereal disease. This was one of the prison 
conditions for which the Eighth Amendment required a remedy, even though
 it was not alleged that the likely harm would occur immediately and 
even though the possible infection might not affect all of those 
exposed. We would think that a prison inmate also could successfully 
complain about demonstrably unsafe drinking water without waiting for an
 attack of dysentery. Nor can we hold that prison officials may be 
deliberately indifferent to the exposure of inmates to a serious, 
communicable disease on the ground that the complaining inmate shows no 
serious current symptoms. 


That the Eighth Amendment protects against future harm
 to inmates is not a novel proposition. The Amendment, as we have said, 
requires that inmates be furnished with the basic human needs, one of 
which is "
reasonable safety
.
" 
DeShaney, supra
, at 200. 
It is "cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions."
 
Youngberg v. Romeo
,
 457 U. S. 307, 315-316 (1982). It would be odd to deny an injunction to
 inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in 
their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them. x x x
[110]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)




 Again, quite notably, the US Supreme Court proclaimed in 
Helling

 that there need not be an actual infection or affliction on the part of
 the inmate before the protection of the Eighth Amendment can apply. As 
applied to petitioners' situation, it is unnecessary to require them to 
submit to a physical examination, or to first show symptoms of COVID-19 
before recognizing a violation or threatened violation of their rights. 
Such a proposition may be evidence of indifference to the toll that 
substandard living conditions in our prison systems exact until it may 
be too late. Perhaps that premise has been rejected not in the least 
because it may well result in an exercise in futility, where the grave 
and possibly irreversible consequences on the right to health of PDLs 
must precede a proper recognition of such a right to begin with. I thus 
respectfully express my reservations to the proposition of some of my 
colleagues that absent a clear showing of the petitioners' health 
status, or that they are "actually suffering from a medical condition 
[requiring] immediate and specialized attention,"
[111]
 the actual risk for the petitioners to contract COVID-19 in their respective penal facilities is speculative.
[112]


 In the later case of 
Brown, et al. v. Plata, et al
.
[113]

 involving a protracted violation of inmates' rights in a California 
prison through substandard and unsafe conditions of detainment, the US 
Supreme Court held that a court-mandated decongestion of the prison 
facilities, as authorized by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 
was crucial in providing a remedy to these violations, and steps taken 
to that end should only be affirmed, 
to wit
:  
          
 Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm 
resulting from these serious constitutional violations. For years the 
medical and mental health care provided by California's prisons has 
fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements and has failed to 
meet prisoners' basic health needs. Needless suffering and death have 
been the well-documented result. Over the whole course of years during 
which this litigation has been pending, no other remedies have been 
found to be sufficient. 
Efforts to remedy the violation have been frustrated by severe overcrowding in California's prison system. 
Short term gains in the provision of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of severe and pervasive overcrowding.
              
 
Overcrowding has overtaken the limited resources of
 prison staff; imposed demands well beyond the capacity of medical and 
mental health facilities; and created unsanitary and unsafe conditions 
that make progress in the provision of care difficult or impossible to 
achieve. 
The overcrowding is the "primary cause of the violation of a
 Federal right," 18 U. S. C. Â§3626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically the severe 
and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners through grossly inadequate 
provision of medical and mental health care.
[114]
 (Emphasis supplied)           
          


 Further echoing the ruling in 
Estelle
, the US 
Supreme Court brought to the fore the positive duty on the part of the 
State to ensure the basic dignity of the human lives that it detains, 
premised on the fact that the detainees, by virtue of their detention, 
are severely limited in their capacity to ensure such dignity 
themselves, 
viz
.:  
          
 As a consequence of their own actions, 
prisoners may be deprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty. Yet
 the law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other 
rights. 
Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all
 persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment 
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. " 'The basic concept 
underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of 
man.' "
 
Atkins v. Virginia
, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002) (quoting 
Trop v. Dulles
, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality opinion)).
              
 To incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means
 to provide for their own needs. Prisoners are dependent on the State 
for food, clothing, and necessary medical care. 
A prison's failure to provide sustenance for inmates "may actually produce physical 'torture or a lingering death.' "
 
Estelle v. Gamble,
 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting 
In re Kemmler
,
 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A. Elsner, Gates of 
Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons (2004). Just as a prisoner 
may starve if not fed, he or she may suffer or die if not provided 
adequate medical care
. A prison that deprives prisoners of basic 
sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the 
concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.
[115]
 (Emphasis supplied)           
          


 It bears emphasis, however, that in these cases, the US 
Supreme Court only ruled on the existence of causes of actions or 
possible claims under the Eighth Amendment, 
but left it to the trial courts to try and hear said claims
,
 aided by the subjective and objective elements that plaintiffs would 
need to prove to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. 
          
 There is no valid reason to depart from this practice 
of the US Supreme Court, considering that claims for violations of a 
PDL's fundamental rights are replete with factual matters best threshed 
out in the trial courts. Justice Bernabe is of the same view, 
recommending that the petition be referred to the appropriate trial 
court for a full-blown hearing on the petitioners' respective 
situations, which should be examined using the "deliberate indifference"
 test.
[116]
 
As such, in 
the same manner that the prayer of the petitioners for themselves and 
for other, similarly situated PDLs to be granted bail or recognizance 
must be brought before the proper trial court for hearings, so should 
any claim for violation under the proscription against cruel and inhuman
 punishment and substandard living conditions
.


 The Court, on a previous occasion, has affirmed its 
power to review alleged violations of the constitutional rights of PDLs.
 In 
In the Matter of Petition for Habeas Corpus of Alejano v. Caubay
,
[117]
 it held: 
          
 x x x Regulations and conditions in detention
 and prison facilities that violate the Constitutional rights of the 
detainees and prisoners will be reviewed by the courts on a case-by-case
 basis. The courts could afford injunctive relief or damages to the 
detainees and prisoners subjected to arbitrary and inhumane conditions.
[118]
 


 At this juncture, I return to the elephant in the room: 
the causal link between the congestion within prison walls and the 
exclusion of PDLs from the standard of care that should be made 
available to them. 
          
 The Court should be mindful of the fact that the 
remedies of bail and recognizance are not available for every PDL. To be
 more precise, these remedies are not extended to PDLs who have already 
started serving their sentence. There should be no reason, however, to 
ignore their plight in the midst of this global pandemic, lest there 
arise a cause of action under the Constitution. It is important to note 
that the US cases referred to earlier were decided outside the 
circumstances of a global pandemic. It is with more reason that, in 
light of the current situation, the State should recognize and 
acknowledge the possible impairment of every PDL's basic right to life 
and human dignity. 
          
 In a proper action initiated at a more opportune time,
 courts may be taken to task to provide relief against the employment of
 physical, psychological, or degrading punishment or against the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities with subhuman conditions. The
 Court, unfortunately, must move only within the bounds of its 
jurisdiction; nonetheless, it has taken the necessary measures within 
its power, in order to guarantee the rights of PDLs in the face of this 
global pandemic. Ultimately, however, the task of providing farsighted 
and enduring solutions to the problem of overcrowding in penal 
facilities is a policy question and formulation that is best within the 
powers of the Legislative and Executive branches. 
          
 All told, pursuant to the significant body of laws 
both within and outside our borders that affirms the positive rights of 
PDLs, I submit that it remains incumbent upon the State to organize and 
utilize its whole apparatus so that these human rights are safeguarded.
[119]

 In other words, any attendant limitation may not excuse a slackening of
 efforts, but on the contrary serve as compulsion for the State to 
exhaust all measures available to it to ensure that these fundamental 
rights of PDLs are appreciated as such. 
          




 III. 




 For its part, in the exercise of its mandate to promulgate
 rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional 
rights
[120]
 and its power of supervision over all persons in custody for purposes of eliminating unnecessary detention,
[121]
 the Court has been implementing systems in promoting rehabilitative and restorative criminal justice. 
          
 One such measure is Administrative Matter (A.M.) No. 12-11-2-SC, or the 
Guidelines for Decongesting Holding Jails by Enforcing the Rights of Accused Persons to Bail and to Speedy Trial
.
 With the current public health emergency, these measures are 
supplemented by various Court issuances aimed at ensuring easy access to
 PDLs of the different modes of securing provisional liberty. Taken 
together, laws and regulations in place have created a framework, 
essential facets of which are as follows: 
          


1. For PDLs currently in custody for a period equal to or
 more than the possible maximum imprisonment prescribed for the offense 
charged, he or she shall be released immediately, without prejudice to 
the continuation of the trial or the proceedings on appeal, as the case 
may be;
[122]
 


 2. For PDLs detained for a period of at least equal to 
the minimum of the penalty for the offense charged against him, he or 
she shall be ordered released, 
motu proprio
 or on motion and 
after notice and hearing, on his own recognizance without prejudice to 
the continuation of the proceedings against him,
[123]
 subject further to the guidelines set forth in Administrative Circular (A.C.) No. 33-2020,
[124]
 as implemented by OCA Circular No. 89-2020,
[125]
 on online bail proceedings and electronic transmission of release orders;
            
 3. For PDLs who qualify for provisional dismissal pursuant to A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC, Section 10,
[126]

 they may secure their release pursuant to said guidelines. For this 
purpose, judges for the first and second level courts are directed to 
immediately conduct an inventory of their pending criminal cases to 
determine cases eligible for provisional dismissal.
[127]


4. For all other PDLs who do not meet the above 
criteria, they may apply for bail. Special considerations are given for 
indigent PDLs who may post bail at a reduced amount or be released on 
recognizance:  
            
 All PDLs may still avail of their rights to bail 
pursuant to the provisions of Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal 
Procedure.
                  


 In promoting social and restorative justice 
especially in this period of public health emergency, indigent PDLs may 
avail of the reduced bail and recognizance under A.C. No. 38-2020:
[128]




 The amounts of bail for indigent PDLs are reduced following the schedule below:






Penalty of Crime Charged


Computation of Reduced Bail












Maximum period of
 reclusion temporal
 or twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years












Medium period of the penalty of the crime charged multiplied by P3,000.00 for every year of imprisonment 
















Maximum period of 
prision mayor
 or six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years












Medium period of the penalty of the crime charged multiplied by P2,000.00 for every year of imprisonment
















Maximum period of 
prision correccional 
or six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years 












Medium period of the penalty of the crime charged multiplied by P1,000.00 for every year of imprisonment 














For indigent PDLs charged with crimes punishable by arresto
 mayor or one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months, and arresto 
menor or one (1) day to thirty (30) days, they may be released on their 
own recognizance. 


For indigent PDLs who meet the criteria set forth in R.A. 
10389, specifically Sections 5, 6, and 7 thereof, they shall be released
 on recognizance pursuant to the provisions therein. 


 In further implementation of these rights, and considering
 the exigencies of the situation brought about by the current public 
health crisis, courts have introduced new capacities and accessible 
processes:  
          
 1. Proceedings concerning the right of the accused to bail
[129]
 and proceedings on provisional dismissal
[130]
 are classified as urgent matters that are immediately heard and resolved by courts during the public health emergency;
              
 2. A.C. No. 33-2020 further provides that motions for 
bail as a matter of right, in accordance with Rule 114, Section 4 of the
 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure,
[131]
 and proceedings on provisional dismissal
[132]
 are applied for and argued electronically, as implemented by OCA Circular No. 89-2020. 
              
 3. Approval of the bail and the consequent release
 order shall likewise be electronically transmitted by the Judge on duty
 to the Executive Judge who in turn shall electronically transmit the 
same within the same day to the proper law enforcement authority or 
detention facility to enable the release of the accused. The 
electronically transmitted approval of bail and release order by the 
Executive Judge shall be sufficient to cause the release of PDL 
concerned.
[133]




 In light of the imposition of modified community 
quarantine in certain areas and the transition into general community 
quarantine for the rest of the country, the courts implemented hearings 
through videoconferencing in a number of pilot courts through A.C. No. 
37-2020,
[134]
 as implemented by OCA Circular No. 93-2020,
[135]

 which will cover all PDLs and may apply to all stages of newly-filed 
and pending criminal cases including, but not limited to, arraignment, 
pre-trial, bail hearings, trial proper, and promulgation. 
          
 It is hoped that these measures are sufficient to 
address the exigencies brought about by the current pandemic for the 
benefit of PDLs, including the petitioners herein. 
          




 IV. 




 In sum, the Court acknowledges the petitioners' and all 
other PDLs' current predicament in the face of this pandemic. Thus, 
prudence and exigency dictate that instead of denying the petition 
outright, the better course of action is to refer the petition to the 
respective trial courts for the conduct of bail proceedings. In the 
process, it is my view that the respective trial courts should also look
 into the petitioners' claims for violations of their rights under 
domestic and international laws to ensure that they are not subjected to
 arbitrary and inhumane conditions in their confinement. 
          
 Indeed, the Court is not unmindful of the current 
situation faced by PDLs. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an 
unprecedented public health crisis, and the sickness and death it leaves
 in its wake have forced all of us to a reckoning. The incredible scale 
of the present problem has perhaps even begun to tug at the seams of the
 familiar limits of institutional jurisdictions. In the clamor to quell 
the spread of the virus on the one hand and address competing public 
concerns on the other, government institutions are hard-pressed at 
confronting issues that fall within the respective provinces of their 
agencies. 
          
 It is also pivotal that all material institutions 
acknowledge that the issue of congestion in our prison systems, along 
with the manner by which it has been brought before the unforgiving 
light of this global pandemic, finds its root in an interplay of system 
failures, over which the penal system is not the sole author. 
The sheer expanse of this crisis requires the synergized response that must outlive the present emergency, 
from all three branches of government
 and all relevant stakeholders.

 Any measure that is less than farsighted and all-inclusive is a mere 
stop-gap that is myopic and wasteful at a time such as this. 
          
 For its part, the Court, as the ultimate dispenser of 
justice, has taken concrete steps to address the matter at hand in ways 
allowed by law, as seen from the previous enumeration of issuances. To 
my mind, these circulars afford the petitioners sufficient reliefs for 
the protection of their rights. 
          
 Verily, the Court has the unenviable role of balancing
 the scales of justice. In this exceptional time, justice compels the 
Court to exercise compassion and humanity but only within the parameters
 granted to it by law. The same spirit that moves the Court to address 
the concerns of PDLs also constrains it not to overstep its bounds. 
          
 It is in this light that I 
CONCUR
 in the Court's disposition to 
refer

 the present bail and recognizance applications to the respective trial 
courts where the petitioners' criminal cases are pending, without 
prejudice to any relief available to the parties under the 
circumstances, and to 
direct
 the aforesaid trial courts to act on the petitioners' cases with
 utmost dispatch

SEPARATE OPINION


 
LAZARO-JAVIER, 
J
.:


 
Prefatory
 


Petitioners allege a 
common denominator
 â they are 
most vulnerable
 to catching the SARS-COV-2 and getting infected with COVID-19.
[1]
 They are detention prisoners or pre-judgment persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) who fall into two (2) categories, either
 sickly older people
 (afflicted with severe medical conditions) or 
pregnant women
, who because of the crimes charged have 
no access to bail as a matter of right
.


 They seek 
provisional liberty
 either on bail for a
 specified amount or on recognizance for themselves and others similarly
 situated as may be determined by a Prisoner Release Committee.
            
 Petitioners approach their grievance in a rather 
novel
 fashion. They claim that their plea 
does not fall
 into any of the 
remedies in the ordinary course of law
. While they assert 
rights
 which they say they 
should already be enjoying as PDLs
, an allegation that in 
ordinary times
 would 
found a cause of action
 for an 
action
, they make the assertion in this case 
only
 in support of their call for the exercise of our 
equity
 jurisdiction, 
specifically humanitarian considerations in light of our current state of public health emergency
.
[2]


 They invoke the ruling in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
[3]
 and the 
relief
 or 
remedy
 for the 
infringement
 of 
petitioners' rights as PDLs
 that 
increases
 the 
risks
 they each face as detainees from COVID-19.
            
 Petitioners are 
not alone
 in their quest for remedial measures in this time of the pandemic.
            
 As they assert, justice systems of 
other
 countries have 
re-engineered
 their 
approach to detaining persons
 accused of committing offenses because of the present pandemic.
[4]


 Respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor 
General (OSG), reduce the issue here to "whether the State can provide 
medical care to the petitioners while maintaining their confinement 
vis-Ã -vis

 the threat of COVID-19." They then enumerate the collective efforts of 
the justice sector at curbing the threat of COVID-19 among PDLs, which 
according to the OSG eliminate the need to grant temporary liberty to 
petitioners on bail for a specified amount or under recognizance.
            
 Indeed, the world has undergone a
 swift transformation
 through the rise of COVID-19. The 
criminal justice system
 is 
not immune
 from the changes being forced upon everyone living through this time. The 
electronic filing 
of the present petition and the physical closure of our courts nationwide, for example, were just months ago 
unimaginable
. Since then, prospects of our return to normalcy has inevitably been prefaced with the cautious caveat of a 
new normal
. How this new normal would evolve and ultimately impact on the 
administration of justice
 and the 
practice of law
 remains to be seen.
            




Equity jurisdiction â what is it and is it necessary?
 






The history of our court system is 
alien
 to the 
distinction
 between a 
court of common law
 and 
court of equity
. In a manner of speaking, we simply woke up one day having a court system that 
did not have
 these two sides of the same coin. Nonetheless, our 
Civil Code
 
has demanded of us judges
 that "
[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws,
" and "
[i]
n
 case of doubt in the interpretation or application of laws, it is 
presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice to prevail
."
[5]


 The history of the court, of common law and the court of equity began with the legal reforms of King Henry II after 1154.
[6]
 Administration of local courts became more centralized.
[7]
 Thus: 
            
 Henry II created a unified system of law 
"common" to the country as whole. This was in part the result of his 
practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear disputes 
throughout the country. Disputes were resolved on an ad hoc basis 
according to what the customs were interpreted to be. The king's judges 
then returned to the court, discussed their cases with other judges in a
 manner that permitted and required them to be used for the 
interpretation and application of the law in future cases. 
In this 
way, the laws of England developed as "common-law" â the collection of 
judge-made decisions based on tradition, custom and precedent, as 
opposed to laws derived from statutes, a civil code or equity.
[8]
 


 By 1215, a court system was created: 
            
 The Court of Exchequer was developed to 
hear disputes where the Crown sought money it claimed it was owed and 
answered claims for money said to be owed by the Crown. The Court of 
Common Plea developed as a local court for civil trials between 
individuals. The Court of King's Bench developed as a court for more 
serious disputes and for the hearing of criminal cases....
[9]
 


 Over time, procedure in the courts of common-law became 
convoluted
 and 
ossified
.
[10]
 Litigants who felt they had been 
cheated
 or 
had not been given justice
 by courts of common-law petitioned the King in person.
[11]
 
From this developed a system of equity
, administered by the Lord Chancellor, in the Court of Chancery.
[12]


 It was observed that: 
            
 [51] The 
basis for decision-making
 in the Court of Chancery was 
equity.
 It was a 
court of conscience
 and
 not a court of rules or laws
.
 An important distinction between court of equity (Chancery) and courts 
of law was that a jury had no role in interpreting the law or in matters
 of conscience. Only a judge could dispense equity."
                
 [52] In courts of law, the opposite was the case. 
The jury answered questions of fact, originally by its own investigation
 and later solely from the evidence produced during a trial. 
Equity and law were frequently in conflict
, and 
litigation could continue for years as courts of law countermanded courts of equity
 and
 vice versa
. This was so even though, by the 17th century, it was established that equity should prevail over the common law.
                
 [53] By the mid-19th century, 
disputes between
, and 
conflicting orders issued by, the courts of law
 and 
the courts of equity
 had
 led to
 a 
breakdown of the English legal system
 - as reflected in Charles Dickens' Bleak House - and the 
merger of the courts of law
 and 
the courts of equity by legislation
 in 1873 and 1875. While the 
principles of law and of equity remained distinct
 for a time after merger, 
legislation created
 a 
unified court system
. 
                
 [54] Various statutes, both in England and in those common-law countries which derive their legal system from England, have 
modified the practices and procedures by which courts determine matters of law and of equity
. For the most part they are based on the practices that pre-existed the English Judicature Act of 1873.
[13]



            The legislation that merged courts of law and court of equity c
onferred no new rights
 but they 
confirmed the rights
 that previously existed in these courts. The law 
merely gave
 to the courts the 
jurisdiction
 previously exercised by both the courts of common law and the Court of Chancery.
[14]
 Thereafter, there was the 
complete consolidation
 of 
equitable 
and 
legal
 
jurisdiction
 and 
practice and procedure
 for both 
equitable
 and 
legal
 remedies in the courts.
[15]


 
Equitable
 and 
legal remedies differ from each other.
 Successful litigants are 
entitled
 to
 legal remedies
.
[16]
 The principal legal remedy is damages.
[17]
 There is however 
no entitlement
 to 
equitable remedies
.
[18]
 By the 
very nature of equity
, they are 
granted by
 the 
discretion
 of the court and are 
unlimited
.
            
 
Equitable remedies
 are called 
such 
because they 
originated
 from
 the 
court of equity
. However, through time, these once flexible 
equitable remedies have
 
themselves
 
ossified into distinct rules
 
like the common law remedies 
they
 had meant to correct for being inflexible. Among the principal 
equitable remedies are declaratory judgments, injunctions, specific 
performance or contract modification, accounting, rescission, estoppel, 
proprietary remedies such as constructive trusts and tracing, 
subrogation, and equitable liens.
            
 In the Philippines, it 
does not make sense
 to
 distinguish between common law and equitable jurisdictions and remedies
 except for historical purposes. This is because our jurisprudence has 
evolved and developed remedies fairly independently of their historical 
roots and has treated remedies 
without
 such distinctions. Thus, the Court does 
not

 have to refer to its supposed equity jurisdiction when it provides 
purportedly equitable remedies, and neither does the Court dispense 
supposed equitable remedies only through its purported equity 
jurisdiction.
            
 The 
evolution
 of equitable remedies into 
distinct rules
 themselves demonstrates that 
equity
 is 
far from
 being a 
willy-nilly
 justice system. 
Flexible principles
 arising from the 
exercise of equitable jurisdiction
 and 
their constant application
 have developed a 
juridical experience
 that 
crystallized
 these 
principles
 into 
defined rules
. In the words of a North American judge: 
            
 In recent years, there has been a 
marked trend away from strict rules and towards flexibility
 and 
importing into the law
 what can be described as 
broad moral principles of reasonableness, fair dealing
 and 
good conscience
. These 
principles point the judge deciding a case in a certain way, but they lack the precision
 and 
certainty of black letter rules
 of law. Most of these doctrines 
spring from
 the tradition of 
equity
. Historically, the 
common law
 was c
haracterized by its relatively rigid rule-based approach
, while 
equity
, 
the "court of conscience"
, came along to
 relieve against the rigours
 of the common law. But it was 
never quite as simple
 as that because the 
common law method of developing rules in a case by case fashion has an inherent flexibility
. The 
common law has gone through periods
 characterized by 
strict adherence to black letter doctrine and rigid application of rules
, while 
at other times
, it has 
emphasized
 the need for 
flexibility, growth
 and renewal. 
Equity
 as well has 
moved back and forth along the continuum
. In its 
origins
, 
equity
 was based on 
broad principles of morality and good conscience, but as experience was gained with the application
 of those principles, 
they tended to crystallize into rules 
and 
equity
 itself 
became rigid
.
 By the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, both the 
common law and equity appear to have reached this point. . . In the 
latter part of the twentieth century, there has been something of a 
resurgence of the spirit of equity. . . . 
Reliance on broad statements of principle
 rather than strict rules arises not only from the desire for 
flexibility
 and the 
need to ensure justice
 in the particular case. It is 
also characteristic of the first step in a fundamental change in the law
. When a 
new doctrine
 emerges, it may only be possible to sketch out in 
general terms
. 
Over time, cases are decided, gaps are filled and there develops a body of doctrine.

 The good neighbour duty of care principle in negligence law pronounced 
by Lord Atkin in Donohue v. Stephenson provides an example of common law
 rule which began as a broad statement of principle . . . I would 
suggest that the modern principles relating to fiduciary, unjust 
enrichment and constructive trust fall into a similar category.
[19]
 

            In this sense, it may be said that petitioners 
have loosely used
 the 
concept of equity
 to found their plea to be released on bail or recognizance when 
allegedly
 they are otherwise not allowed to. As we have said, we 
never had that division
 between a court of common law and a court of equity, and in reality, our legal system is a 
hybrid
 or 
a cross
 between the common and the civil law jurisdictions. As well, our jurisprudence 
does not allow
 equity to supplant and contravene the provision of law clearly applicable to a case, and conversely, 
cannot give
 validity to an act that is prohibited by law or one that is against public policy.
            
 In this light, 
respondents' objection
 to the use of the word 
"humanitarian"
 in their Comment's prefatory may 
appear to be justified
 since petitioners 
could have grounded
 their prayer upon 
established law
 or 
jurisprudence
 without having to summon the 
amorphou
s and 
value-laden adjectives
 
humanitarian
 or 
equitable
.
            
 Verily, it is 
not necessary
 to invoke 
equity
 or
 humanitarianism
 so courts could have the 
needed flexibility to do justice

 in a particular case under specifically unique circumstances, or to be 
able to rely upon broad moral principles of reasonableness, fair dealing
 and good conscience in resolving issues. 
Articles 9
[20]
 and 
10
[21]
 of our 
Civil Code
 already provide the 
legal bases 
for doing so. And, as regards bail, our 
jurisprudence
 has already allowed 
inroads
 of 
flexibility
 and 
broad moral principles
 to justify what others have believed to be a 
just outcome
.
            




Bail rules â is it feasible to navigate through and accommodate flexibility and broad moral principles?
 






Bail is 
not a matter of right
 for an accused charged with a crime punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment. This rule has been 
interpreted
 and 
practiced
 as requiring the detention of an accused until he or she has sought a bail hearing 
and
 the prosecution is 
not
 able to prove that the evidence of his or her guilt is strong.
[22]








The Enrile two-step test for provisional liberty.








The 
availability of bail
 to an accused charged with crimes punishable by death, life imprisonment or 
reclusion perpetua
, however, has been 
modified
 to significant extents by our ruling in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
.
[23]


 In 
Enrile
, despite the absence of a bail 
hearing where the prosecution could have proved that the evidence of 
guilt is strong, the Court allowed Senator Enrile to post bail on 
account of his 
exceptional circumstances
 (
i.e.
, advanced age and ill health requiring special medical attention) and the bottom line that 
he was not a flight risk
. Despite the vigorous and well-reasoned 
Opinion
 of Justice Leonen, the Court made room for 
flexibility
 and 
broad moral principles
, as we 
re-stated
 the rule from 
Dela Rama v. The People's Court
[24]
 as follows: 
            


 Bail for the provisional liberty of the accused, 
regardless of the crime charged, should be allowed independently of the 
merits of the charge, 
provided his continued incarceration is clearly shown to be injurious to his health or to endanger his life
. Indeed, 
denying him bail despite imperiling his health and life would not serve the true objective of preventive incarceration
 during the trial. . . . It is relevant to observe that granting provisional liberty to Enrile will then 
enable
 him to have his medical condition be properly addressed and better 
attended to by competent physicians in the hospitals of his choice
. This will not only aid in his adequate preparation of his defense but, more importantly, will 
guarantee his appearance in court for the trial
.




 
Enrile
 has ingrained in jurisprudence a 
two-step test
 to authorize the grant of bail when it is 
discretionary
 to do so: 
(a)
 the detainee will not be a flight risk or a danger to the community; and 
(b)
 there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances. This 
test
 involves the 
balancing of factual and legal factors
 before resolving to grant or deny the application for bail. 
            
 Through 
Enrile
, our jurisprudence 
has thus incorporated
 the 
degree of flexibility
 and the 
broad moral principles
 to the 
black-letter law on bail as a matter of discretion
 to the 
extent necessary
 to serve complete justice in particular situations, first, in 
Dela Rama
, and later, in 
Enrile
.
            
 
Rather than an exercise of equitable jurisdiction in its strict historical sense
, the 
reasoning
 and 
disposition
 in 
Enrile
 is an 
illustration
 of the 
Civil Code
 provisions that "
[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws
," and "
[i]n
 case of doubt in the interpretation or application of laws, it is 
presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice to prevail.
"
            
 In 
Enrile
, the Court 
did not reference
 equitable principles in the 
strict historical sense
 of a body of rules as a counterpoint to those established among courts of common law. Perhaps in the 
loose sense
 of equity being the equivalent of flexibility and broad moral principles, 
Enrile
 stands for this proposition 
and more
. 
            
 
Enrile
 was 
expressly conscious to build on earlier case law
 to serve complete justice to Senator Enrile's circumstances. It is 
not
 a 
random
 or a 
cowboy sense of justice
 that it was serving, but one 
anchored on rules founded a long time ago
. 
            
 
Enrile
 thus represents what has been said about
 common law being itself flexible
 and 
accommodating of broad moral principles
 without having to distinguish it from and summoning 
equity
. We were able to 
navigate through the established rules
 on bail as a matter of discretion to 
arrive at
 a conclusion that we thought would 
not
 have been possible under established rules 
but nonetheless consistent
 with the 
stability 
and 
predictability
 valued in every legal system. 
            
 The learned Justice Leonen reiterates his 
principled stand
 to dissent from the doctrine set forth in 
Enrile

 and therefore to refuse applying its ruling in subsequent cases. I 
deeply admire his consistency in this regard. But we have to ask 
ourselves, what are we to do with this En Banc 
Decision
?
            
 Article 8 of the 
Civil Code
 states that 
"[j]udicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the 
Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines."
            
 
Enrile
 is a clear and categorical statement of 
positive law

 pursuant to the Court's constitutional and inherent power to "settle 
actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and 
enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the 
part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government,"
[25]

 and "to promulgate rules and procedures for the protection and 
enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure 
in all courts."
            
 For better or for worse, until overturned, our jurisprudence has to reckon with 
Enrile
 as a rule that may be invoked and should be applied whenever the circumstances of a case call for it. 
            
As judges, we are "the visible representation of the 
law, and more importantly, of justice. It is from [the judge] that the 
people draw their will and awareness to obey the law. For the judge to 
return that regard, [the judge] must be the first to abide by the law 
and weave an example for others to follow. Consequently, the last person
 to refuse to adhere to the directives of the Court . . . is the judge 
himself."
[26]


 On the other hand, my learned senior brethren, Justice Caguioa, specifically referred to my opinion on 
Enrile
 as follows: 
            


xxx. For the same reason above, I disagree with the position that 
Enrile

 has ingrained in jurisprudence a two-step test to authorize the grant 
of bail when it is discretionary to do so: (a) the detainee will not be a
 flight risk or a danger to the community; and (b) there exist special, 
humanitarian and compelling circumstances. 
The ruling in 
Enrile
 deviates from entrenched legal principles concerning bail and it cannot be used to create doctrine for subsequent cases.
 To reiterate, petitioner therein was allowed to post bail even though he was charged with an offense punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
, without any showing through a hearing that the evidence of his guilt is not strong. 
Having skirted the minimum requirements under the Constitution regarding bail, the ruling in 
Enrile
 should not be used to set precedent for cases involving discretionary bail.
 


Moreover, 
the grant of bail in 
Enrile
 on the basis of petitioner's age and health rests on shaky ground
 as the circumstances therein were quite peculiar. As illustrated in Justice Leonen's Dissenting Opinion therein: 






 Neither was there grave abuse of discretion 
by the Sandiganbayan when it failed to release accused on bail for 
medical or humanitarian reasons. His release for medical and 
humanitarian reasons was not the basis for his prayer in his Motion to 
Fix Bail filed before the Sandiganbayan. Neither did he base his prayer 
for the grant of bail in this Petition on his medical condition.
                  
 
The grant of bail, therefore, by the majority is a special accommodation for petitioner.
 It is 
based on a ground never raised before the Sandiganbayan or in the pleadings filed before this court.
 The Sandiganbayan should not be faulted for not shedding their neutrality and impartiality. It is 
not
 the duty of an impartial court to find what it deems a better argument 
for the accused at the expense of the prosecution and the people
 they represent. 
                  
 The allegation that petitioner suffers from 
medical conditions that require very special treatment is a question of 
fact. We cannot take judicial notice of the truth contained in a 
certification coming from one doctor. This doctor has to be presented as
 an expert witness who will be subjected to both direct and cross 
examination so that he can properly manifest to the court the physical 
basis for his inferences as well as the nature of the medical condition 
of petitioner. Rebutting evidence that may be presented by the 
prosecution should also be considered. All this would be proper before 
the Sandiganbayan. Again, none of this was considered by the 
Sandiganbayan because petitioner insisted that he was entitled to bail 
as a matter of right on grounds other than his medical condition. 
                  
 Furthermore, 
the majority's opinion
 -- other than the invocation of a general human rights principle -- 
does not provide clear legal basis for the grant of bail on humanitarian grounds.

 Bail for humanitarian considerations is neither presently provided in 
our Rules of Court nor found in any statute or provision of the 
Constitution. 
                  
 This case 
leaves this court open
 to a 
justifiable criticism
 of granting a 
privilege ad hoc: only for one person
 -- petitioner in this case. 
                  
 
Worse, it puts pressure on all trial courts
 and the Sandiganbayan that will predictably be deluged with motions to 
fix bail on the basis of humanitarian considerations. The lower courts 
will have to decide, without guidance, whether bail should be granted 
because of advanced age, hypertension, pneumonia, or dreaded diseases. 
They
 will have to decide whether this is applicable only to Senators and 
former Presidents charged with plunder and not to those accused of drug 
trafficking, multiple incestuous rape, serious illegal detention, and 
other crimes punishable by 
reclusion perpetua 
or life 
imprisonment. They will have to decide whether this is applicable only 
to those who are in special detention facilities and not to the aging or
 sick detainees in overcrowded detention facilities all over this 
country. 
                  
 
Our trial courts and the Sandiganbayan will decide on the basis of personal discretion 
causing petitions for 
certiorari
 to be filed before this court. This will usher in 
an
 era of truly selective justice not based on clear legal provisions, but
 one that is unpredictable, partial, and solely grounded on
 the presence or absence of 
human compassion on the day
 that justices of this court deliberate and vote.              
              




 Ergo, a 
reading of the ruling in 
Enrile
 shows that there is no discernible standard

 for the courts to decide cases involving discretionary bail on the 
basis of humanitarian considerations. The ineluctable conclusion, as 
opined by Justice Leonen, is that 
the grant of bail by the majority in 
Enrile
 was a special accommodation for petitioner therein
. Thus, at the risk of being repetitious, 
the ruling in 
Enrile
 should be considered as a stray decision
 and, echoing Justice Bernabe, must likewise be 
considered as 
pro hac vice
.
 It

 should not be used as the benchmark in deciding cases involving the 
question on whether bail may be allowed on the basis of humanitarian 
considerations. 
Notably,
 under the Rules of Court, humanitarian considerations
 such as age and health 
are only taken into account in fixing the bail amount
 after a determination that evidence of guilt against the accused is not strong.
                
 However, petitioners are not left without any other recourse that is legally permissible. Despite the inapplicability of
 Enrile

 and in view of the novel nature of this case, the Court should not be 
precluded from affording petitioners the appropriate reliefs within the 
bounds of law. 
                
 In this regard, a proper bail hearing before the
 trial court should first be conducted to determine whether the evidence
 of guilt against the petitioners is strong. This Court, not being a 
trier of facts, cannot receive and weigh petitioners' evidence at the 
first instance. Factual and evidentiary matters must first be threshed 
out in a proper bail hearing, which may only be done in the lower 
courts. Trial courts are better equipped to assess petitioners' 
entitlement to bail or recognizance based on the provisions of the 
Constitution, the relevant laws, and the Rules of Court. 
                
 Thus, instead of dismissing the petition outright, I join Justice Bernabe's recommendation 
to refer or remand this petition to the concerned trial courts.


 Exigency is better served if the trial courts 
where the criminal cases of petitioners are respectively pending will hear their bail petitions and receive their evidence.



            With all due respect, I truly cannot read 
Enrile
 through Justice Leonen's eagle eyes because his reading is simply 
not 
the
 Supreme Court's decision. Justice Leonen was very emphatic about the 
Court's favorable treatment of Senator Enrile, but the Majority chose 
not
 to side with him and to believe otherwise.
            
 The Majority did 
not
 describe 
Enrile
 as a ruling for the 
sole
 and 
exclusive benefit 
of Senator Enrile. The Majority 
could not 
have said that 
Enrile
 was 
pro hac vice
 because that would have 
only validated
 what Justice Leonen has long been articulating about the decision â 
that we have a justice system for the powerful and another justice system for the powerless.
 Any reading of 
Enrile
 will 
never
 elicit that admission. 
            
 The Majority, I am sure, especially then Chief Justice Lucas P. Bersamin, will 
never
 admit enunciating a
 ground-breaking doctrine

 only to favor and pander to "Senators and former Presidents charged 
with plunder and not to those accused of drug trafficking, multiple 
incestuous rape, serious illegal detention, and other crimes punishable 
by 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment. . . . those who are 
in special detention facilities and not to the aging or sick detainees 
in overcrowded detention facilities all over this country."
            
 Admittedly, the present En Banc has the authority to reject and set aside the doctrine laid down by the Court En Banc in 
Enrile
[27]
 by characterizing it as 
pro hac vice
. 
But
 this ruling will just be a 
euphemism

 for what Justice Leonen has been dissenting about â that the Court lays
 down doctrines to pamper the powerful, to grant a "privilege ad hoc: 
only for one person," that 
Enrile
 applies only to Senator Enrile because of who and what he is. 
            
 Another 
unfortunate
 consequence of characterizing Senator Enrile's eponymous hit ruling as 
pro hac vice
 is 
to apply
 the 
rejection
 of the 
Enrile
 doctrine 
retroactively
.
[28]
 
During this pandemic
, an 
exceptional
 circumstance, it 
at once
 denies petitioners at least their 
right to invoke
 the 
Enrile
 doctrine to their cause, for the simple reason that it was crafted and 
especially tailored-fit solely
 for Senator Enrile's benefit. 
            
 I am 
not
 willing to travel this extent of unfairness. It 
was the Court
 that put the doctrine out there. If the Court is to pull it back, at least 
allow those who have already invoked it

 the benefit of the doubt no matter how marginalized and uninfluential 
they are. And only thereafter, may the Court set the doctrine aside 
because the Court supposedly just wants to favor Senator Enrile. 
            
 Going forward, I 
completely disagree
 with the opinions expressed that 
Enrile
 does 
not
 provide for clear-cut standards to justify release on bail for a specified amount or on recognizance. As stated,
 Enrile
 enunciates a 
two-step test
 that is more than clear and determinable. The 
Enrile
 test 
can even accommodate
 Senior Justice Perlas-Bernabe's reference to the 
"deliberate indifference" test 
as a standard for justifying other forms of custodial arrangements. 
            






Provisional liberty as a relief or remedy for the infringement of every PDL's right against jail congestion.
 












Ruminations on Justice Leonen's Separate Opinion










A true scholar, Justice Leonen carefully dissects the 
international and local laws to determine the rights of PDLs as PDLs, 
and the problematic implementation of these rights. He then narrows down
 the problem areas among the plethora of these rights to that specific 
matter which is of public knowledge, or is capable of unquestionable 
demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial 
functions â the problem, of congestion in our holding centers. Thus: 


The Court may take judicial notice of the nature
 of COVID-19 and the long standing jail congestion which has plagued the
 Philippine jails and how this unresolved crisis is a significant threat
 to the right to life, health, and security of persons detained in such 
conditions. 

            I agree with Justice Leonen that the Court may take judicial
 notice of jail congestion. This problem has long hounded our holding 
centers that the Court has once mandated judges to conduct jail 
visitations in an effort to decrease inmate population and proffer 
suggestions for better management of these facilities.
            
 I also agree with Justice Leonen that the Philippines 
has incorporated the minimum standards on the treatment of PDLs in 
international law into our local laws, and as a result, the minimum 
standards may be judicially enforced. 
            
 I respectfully disagree, however, with the argument 
that an infringement of these minimum standards, such as the 
overcrowding in jails, is tantamount to cruel and inhuman punishment, 
because these minimum standards "operationalize the right against cruel 
and inhuman punishment."
            
 Our jurisprudence has taken a conservative approach to the constitutional proscription against cruel and inhuman punishment. 
            
 
Maturan v. Commission on Elections
[29]
 reiterated its conceptualization as extending only to situations of 
extreme
 corporal or psychological 
form
 or 
character
 of the 
punishment
 rather than its 
severity
 in respect of its 
duration
 or 
amount
, and â
            
 ... applies to punishments which never 
existed in America or which public sentiment regards as cruel or 
obsolete. This refers, for instance, to those inflicted at the whipping 
post or in the pillory, to burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, 
disemboweling and the like. The fact that the penalty is severe provides
 insufficient basis to declare a law unconstitutional and does not, by 
that circumstance alone, make it cruel and inhuman. 


Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice
[30]
 excluded from the meaning of cruel and inhuman punishment the infliction of pain or distress that is 
merely incidental
 in 
carrying out
 the punishment. It 
rejected
 cruelty as the mere infliction of pain or suffering, because if it were, no one would ever be punished at all. 
Echegaray
 held that "[t]he cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is 
cruelty inherent in the method
 of punishment, 
not the necessary suffering involved in any method
 employed to extinguish life humanely."
            
 While the 
minimum standards on the treatment of PDLs
 are no doubt part and parcel of protecting, defending and promoting the dignity of PDLs, 
their infringement
 does 
not
 rise to the level of 
what we have conceived
 to be 
cruel and inhuman punishment
. The minimum standards have 
nothing to do
 with the 
form, character,
 or 
method
 of punishment, and though subpar PDL conditions may affect the 
severity
 of the punishment meted out, this is just 
incidental 
to the implementation of the punishment. 
            
 It is true that 
jail congestion
 impacts more on the PDLs' right to life and its cognate rights under Section 1, Article III of the 
Constitution
 
amidst the pandemic
 than during ordinary times. 
            
 It is 
equally true
, however, that if the right to life contemplates the existence only of 
negative rights 
or
 rights of non-interference
, in order 
to establish a breach of the right to life
, a claimant 
must first show
 that he or she 
was deprived
 of his or her right to life and its cognate rights, and 
then must establish
 that 
the State caused such deprivation
 without due process of law. 
Active State interference
 with one's life, security or health by way of some 
affirmative
, 
positive
, or 
definitive
 act will be 
necessary
 in order to engage the protection of this right. There will 
also
 be a 
need to establish a causal link
 between State action and harm alleged to have been suffered. This
 requires 
searching for a 
causal nexus
 tying the State to petitioners' inability to exercise their right to life. Such a 
nexus
 could only ever be established by pointing to a 
positive state action giving rise to the aggrieved condition.


 The Court has thus held:  
            
 The legitimacy of a government is 
established and its functions delineated in the Constitution. From the 
Constitution flows all the powers of government in the same manner that 
it sets the limits for their proper exercise. In particular, 
the Bill
 of Rights functions primarily as a deterrent to any display of 
arbitrariness on the part of the government or any of its 
instrumentalities.
 It serves as the general safeguard, as is 
apparent in its first section which states, "No person shall be deprived
 of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any 
person be denied the equal protection of the laws." Specifically, 
due process is a requirement for the validity of any governmental action amounting to deprivation
 of liberty or property. It is a 
restraint on state action

 not only in terms of what it amounts to but how it is accomplished. Its
 range thus covers both the ends sought to be achieved by officialdom as
 well as the means for their realization.
[31]
 

            Here, we 
cannot fault respondents
 for the 
increased risks
 to life, security and health brought about by COVID-19 
even among the inmates
, including petitioners, of our 
overcrowded
 jail facilities. In a manner of speaking, paraphrasing one classic song, respondents 
did not light the fire
 as it seemed 
to have always been burning since the world has been turning
. They 
have not engaged 
in any 
definitive, affirmative
 or 
positive State action
 to cause such increased risks of deprivation.
            
 Nevertheless,
 even if
 the right to life does 
not
 contemplate the existence 
only
 of
 negative rights
 (
i.e
., to identify some 
definitive, affirmative
 or 
positive
 act, 
in contrast
 to
 mere inaction
,
 on the part of the State which could be said to constitute an 
interference with this right and consequently ground the claim of a 
violation) and has 
positive rights dimension
 (
i.e
., whether the right to life i
mposes on the State a duty to act
 where it has not done so), I would have 
reached the same conclusion
 that respondents 
did not breach 
petitioners' or any other PDL's right to life 
amidst the increased dangers
 to life, security and health
 caused by
 the 
pandemic
.
      
        
 If the right to life includes a 
positive dimension
, such that it is 
not merely
 a 
right of non-interference but also a right of performance
, then it is 
violable
 even by 
mere inaction
 or 
failure
 by the State 
to actively provide the conditions necessary
 for its fulfilment, or to
 alleviate petitioners' condition
, and 
not
 on whether the State can be held causally responsible for the aggrieved's condition in the first place.
          
 Here, respondents 
have taken positive measures

 to minimize the spread of COVID-19 within holding centers and the 
infection of petitioners and other PDLs of this disease. They have 
not
 remained idle and inactive to simply let the PDLs be afflicted. They have 
actively endeavoured to block
 the conditions necessary for the virus' contagion and to
 alleviate petitioners' increased risks
 to this viral infection.
          
 While these measures may 
not
 be enough, their 
inadequacy
 is
 attributable
 to so 
many varied factors
. These 
factors
 are 
beyond respondents' control
 and 
levels of authority and responsibility
, and include the 
unpredictable
 nature of the pandemic and, should there be finger-pointing at this time, the 
collective and systemic inadequacies not only
 of 
all 
the institutions and stakeholders in our criminal justice system, 
but also
 of the entire State machinery responsible for the allocation of limited resources.
          
 We may take
 judicial notice
 of the
 pitfalls
 in complying with the minimum standards of the treatment of PDLs. It is
 factual 
and 
accurate
 that there is 
overcrowding
 in most of our jails.
          
 However, 
attributing
 this setback 
solely
 to respondents is both unfair and inaccurate. We may take
 judicial notice
 of the publicly known fact that respondents 
do not also want
 this dire situation happening in their facilities. But what can they do? The 
population
 and
 facilities 
in their holding centers are the 
outcomes of so many variables
 outside their control and competence.
          
 
Neither
 will it be
 correct 
to
 remediate
 this concern by directing the
 release of such number of PDLs
 as would match the holding centers' respective capacities.
          
 To begin with, there is 
no law
 which 
requires
 this type of relief or remedy for an
 innocent slip-up 
or 
non-compliance
 with the minimum standards.
 Neither
 is it 
beneficial
, 
desirable
 nor 
practicable
. In fact, granting 
this type
 of relief or remedy will put the Court on the spot and in a
 compromising slippery slope position
 where 
we would have to order the release 
of a PDL each time a minimum standard is 
not

 met, simply because of the theory that these minimum standards as to 
safety, sanitary, and sufficient provisions and facilities 
operationalize the right against cruel and inhuman punishment.


 More, the present case is 
not about 
vindicating the rights of 
all PDLs
 to the minimum standards of treatment. The petition is about petitioners' concerns, and while petitioners and some of us may 
want to extend
 its beneficial effects 
to other PDLs
, this 
only rests on
 and is 
only due
 
to
 the 
impact of the pandemic
.
          
 In any event, since the case here is
 not per se
 about the enforcement of the minimum standards, it would 
not
 be fair and wise 
to deal with
 the forms of 
relief 
or 
remedy
 for the alleged infringement thereof 
without
 hearing from respondents. 
Before crafting the relief or remedy
, respondents 
must first be heard to shed light
 on the infringement, if any, and its nature and impact, and their justifications for such state of affairs.
          






Ruminations on Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe's Separate Opinion
 








A rock of integrity and competence, Senior Associate 
Justice Perlas-Bernabe provides a solid legal anchor to the views I have
 expressed above. While it has not been shown that respondents are 
responsible for any infringement of the minimum standards, petitioners 
must have the opportunity to prove their claims against respondents. 
Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe has outlined the framework of 
the 
deliberate indifference test
 by which petitioners could proceed for this purpose.






Bail in the time of COVID-19 â quo vadis, whither goest thou?
 






Petitioners seek bail for a designated amount or upon recognizance as a counter-measure to prevent their COVID-19 infection.








Prisons and justice officials worldwide respond... â an overview.








Petitioners are 
not
 the only ones seeking urgent ameliorative measures at detention facilities.


 As the petition has poignantly stressed, which the Court can take judicial notice of, 
several other countries
 have reacted 
swiftly
 to beat, or at least so their leaders thought, COVID-19 to the draw. We rely on 
online news feeds
 to validate petitioners' claims that detainees or prisoners 
have indeed been released
 in other countries as one of the countermeasures against the virus and its disease. We 
cannot vouch
 however for the 
circumstances
 of their detainees' or prisoners' release and the
 issues 
and the 
decision-making process
 that went with this 
countermeasure
, if it were the result of a 
political,
 
administrative,
 or
 judicial
 decision.
            
 The 
World Health Organization (WHO)

 has published an interim guidance on how to deal with the virus and its
 disease in prisons and other places of detention, entitled 
"Preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in prisons and other 
places of detention." 
WHO
 describes the material and its rationale, as follows:
            


 The guidance 
provides useful information
 to staff and health care providers working in prisons, and to prison authorities. It 
explains how to prevent and address a potential disease outbreak

 and stresses important human rights elements that must be respected in 
the response to COVID-19 in prisons and other places of detention. 
Access to information and adequate health care provision, including for 
mental disorders, are essential aspects in preserving human rights in 
such places.


 
Controlling the spread of infection in these settings is essential for preventing large outbreaks
 of COVID-19. The guidance aims

 to protect the health and well-being of all those who live, work in and
 visit these settings
 and
 the general population at large
. 
People deprived of their liberty, and those living or working in 
enclosed environments in their close proximity, are likely to be more 
vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease than the general population. 
Moreover,
 correctional facilities may amplify and enhance COVID-19 transmission beyond their walls.

 According to the newly published WHO guidance, the global effort to 
tackle the spread of disease may fail without proper attention to 
infection control measures within prisons.
[32]




 
Indonesia
 has released nearly 23,000 
prisoners out of the projected release of 30,000 prisoners who have 
served two-thirds of their respective sentences.
[33]
 This is meant to reduce inmate population and prevent the rapid spread of the virus.
[34]


 In the 
United States
, prisoners serving sentences have been targeted for early release, subject to certain criteria:
            


 In response, officials have begun to take action. On 
the federal level, Attorney General William Barr released a memo last 
week that ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons to identify "at-risk 
inmates who -are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism 
and who might be safer serving their sentences in home confinement." His
 plan, however, has been criticized because these inmates will be 
identified by an algorithm that the Marshall Project reports is biased 
toward white people.


 And realistically, it's state officials that need to 
take bolder action: There are only about 226,000 people locked up in 
federal facilities compared to the nearly 1.3 million in state prisons, 
according to the Prison Policy Institute. Some have begun to release the
 incarcerated. Most recently, California announced that it would let out
 3,500 nonviolent inmates in the next 60 days â the most drastic measure
 taken by states so far. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also 
announced the city had released 900 people as of March 31.
[35]




 In the
 Islamic Republic of Iran
, some 
85,000 inmates have been temporarily freed, mostly non-violent offenders
 serving short sentences and some political prisoners.
[36]


 
Afghanistan 
has taken the same precautionary measure, involving mostly women, young offenders and sickly inmates.
[37]


 In 
Canada
, there has been a clarion
 call to limit the number of people in detention facilities, encourage 
the attorneys-general and the provinces, territories, and federally, to 
persuade police officers, prosecutors, and judges to exercise their 
discretion and not jail people
 if it is not required by public safety.
[38]
 As
 a result, it has been observed that "[a] flurry of court decisions 
suggest that even those accused of violent crimes are winning release. 
As one judge wrote, the pandemic had '
reordered
 the 
usual calculus
."
[39]


 Indeed, COVID-19 
has taken its toll
 on the 
normative
, 
what we must or ought to do
, and have 
altered the narrative
 to a 
passive reactive new normal
, 
what has been done to us, and in response, what must be done by us.








Our reply... â balancing varied interests.








 Here, I take petitioners' assertions 
very seriously
. Not only for their sakes, but for the sake of the general population, including us. This is because as 
WHO
 has confirmed, "correctional facilities may amplify and enhance COVID-19 transmission beyond their walls."
            
 We 
can take judicial notice
 of 
materials suggesting
 that the COVID-19 situation is 
under control in our jails
, and that 
prison officials have established isolation facilities
 for PDLs who may exhibit even the mildest symptoms of the virus
[40]
 infection as well as 
procedures restricting family visits and strict querying protocols
 upon admission for signs of this virus.
            
 We may 
accept as evidence
 the 
laudable efforts of our jail wardens to curtail or even withdraw 
altogether the few niceties that pre-judgment PDLs had available to them
 previously, such as religious services. Viewed strictly in the context 
of COVID-19, that is welcome news.
            
 We may even 
take judicial notice
 of respondents' 
concrete earnest efforts 
to
 prevent
 the 
transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
 and the
 infection of PDLs
, including petitioners, 
with COVID-19
, as painstakingly specified in their Comment. We may further
 accept

 as evidence respondents' claim that MMDJ-4 at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig 
City, the Taguig City Jail-Female Dormitory, Manila City Jail-Female 
Dorm, and the Manila City Jail-Male Dormitory have 
no confirmed cases
 of COVID-19.
            
 But we do 
not
 live in a bubble. We, too, may
 take judicial notice
 of the fact that this virus is
 contagious
 even before a person demonstrates signs of infection. Persons can be asymptomatic yet be highly contagious. These 
facts are well known in the community
 given the proliferation of formal and informal media coverage on COVID-19. We note 
how rapidly events have changed

 from day to day, with a corresponding rise in the numbers of 
individuals who are infected, who die, and fortunately, who are cured of
 this abominable menace.
            
 We may likewise
 take judicial notice
 of the fact that 
recommended physical distancing
 and 
frequent hand washing
 which are required as protection against COVID-19 are 
not readily available
 while a person is in custody at our facilities. This is 
not a criticism 
of our facilities much less their administrators. It is
 merely a statement of the fact
 that our pre-judgment PDLs 
cannot adequately physically isolate 
or
 wash their hands 
with frequency in the facilities.
            
 Just 
because petitioners have been deprived of their liberty
 and 
are stuck in jails
 in Luzon, they are 
already vulnerable
 to an 
increased risk
 of contracting the disease brought about by the virus. We need
 not require
 petitioners to satisfy the Court that they have
 some subjective personal characteristics
 for us to accept that each of them is at an
 increased
 risk of infection. We 
do not need evidence
 to accept this proposition.
            
 At most, petitioners' alleged 
pre-existing medical conditions
 render each of them just 
even more prone
 to infection by this virus and contracting its disease. Their pre-existing medical conditions 
make the risk of infection riskier
. 
But the absence of these conditions does not remove altogether the risk
 that have been heightened as a result of their being in jails. At any rate, from my end, I can 
accept as fact
 that they each have 
pre-existing medical conditions 
that put each of them at a
 higher than normal risk of infections
 generally. I have 
no evidence to contradict
 their assertions on this point, and I 
accept
 them.
            
 In view of the 
life-changing impact 
of
 COVID-19 upon the totality of our social and economic well-being, the 
administration of our government, the dispensation of justice, and our 
individual lifestyles, I am of the view that this
 pandemic 
constitutes
 exceptional and material change of circumstances
 that permits us 
to look closely 
and
 with urgency
 into petitioners' plea.
            
 The reasoning in 
Enrile
 will 
help us resolve
 this case.
            
 In 
Enrile
, the Court found that the 
greatly elevated health risk
 posed to Senator Enrile as a PDL than when he is on bail or under another form of custodial arrangement, is 
a factor that must be considered
 in evaluating whether to grant discretionary bail. 
Enrile
 posed a
 two-step test
: (a) that the detainee will 
not be a flight risk 
or
 a danger
 to the community; and (b) that 
there exist special, humanitarian
 and 
compelling circumstances.


 Here, in the same manner, the
 threat
 that the 
virus
 poses to every PDL is 
one factor
 to be considered in the 
balancing of the interests
 attending the pre-judgment detention of an accused. It is a 
special
, 
humanitarian
 and 
compelling
 circumstance that fulfils the 
second step
 of the test.
            
 It 
bears emphasis though
 that the existence 
and
 contagious nature of COVID-19 while 
highly relevant
 is 
not solely determinative
. It is 
just one of the factors
 that the Court must assess. There are 
other concerns
, which specifically deal with 
first step
.
            
 As in 
Enrile
, a 
factor
 in the 
first step
 is the
 flight risk of 
 the pre-judgment PDL, or in this case, the 
PDLs
 â 
will he or she or they attend court hearings?
 Note that there are 
so many of them directly seeking the Court's intervention
, which
 makes a whole lot of a difference
 than when the Court is 
dealing with only a single individual
 whose court attendance must be secured.
            
 I also articulate
 some of the other factors
 we must consider:
            






(i)


Is there a 
substantial likelihood
 or 
substantial risk
 that the pre-judgment PDL or PDLs would be 
committing the same or another crime
,
 using as contexts the circumstances of the offense with which the 
pre-judgment PDL or the PDLs is or are charged and their individual 
personality or personalities?






 


 






(ii)


Will the grant of bail for a specified amount or upon recognizance 
maintain the peoples' trust and confidence in our system of administering justice
,
 having regard to the pre-judgment PDLs' respective situations, 
including the apparent strength of the prosecution's case, the gravity 
of the crime per se, the hideous or attenuating circumstances 
surrounding its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of 
imprisonment and other criminal penalties?






 


 






(iii)


Are there 
custodial arrangements
 by which respondents 
could reduce
 the 
greatly elevated health risk
 posed to petitioners as pre-judgment PDLs with pre-existing medical conditions by the COVID-19 disease? 






 


 






(iv)


Will petitioners' 
release on bail
 be 
actually beneficial to them
, that is, will each of them be
 actually inoculated

 from COVID-19 through such means as physically distancing, protective 
gears, frequent handwashing, and others that may be required hereafter?






 


 






(v)


With the
 enactment of RA 11469 (2020)
, 
Bayanihan To Heal As One Act
, will the Court 
not trudge on questions of policy
 that are 
better left
 to the Executive Branch, specifically the
 Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Philippines (IATF)
 under EO 168 (2014) as amended,
 to address
 under the 
doctrines of authentic political question and primary jurisdiction
?








As respondents have clarified, 
petitioners' respective offenses
 are
 serious
 and 
violent
. Respondents also emphasized that a number of them 
failed to report
 to their respective courts 
after their safe conduct passes
 to attend the peace talks abroad were revoked by the Philippine Government. Petitioners were 
subsequently arrested
 on the basis of warrants of arrest issued against each of them. Respondents also 
detailed
 each of the detention center's 
efforts to combat
 the spread and transmission of COVID-19 not only among petitioners but the other PDLs as well.


 Beyond the factors which the Court are competent to weigh in, we must consider as well that COVID-19 is 
also
 a 
national health concern
, the 
response
 to which
 impacts
 on the 
whole fabric
 and 
every strand
 of our polity. Ultimately, it was for this reason that Congress passed RA 11469 (2020), 
BayanihanTo Heal As One Act
, so that there will be a 
united front 
against this
 common invisible enemy
.
            
 In this context, there will be 
consequences to the plans
 already laid down by the IATF if we are to release petitioners, and later, others similarly situated, on bail. 
Resources
 of the 
Executive Branch
 will be 
diverted
 and 
used
 simply 
to monitor

 petitioners' whereabouts and activities during the period of national 
health emergency. If granted, their release could become an 
unnecessary distraction
 to the current efforts to fight the virus and its disease. As respondents seem to assert in their Comment, petitioners are 
better quarantined
 at their present detention centers.
            
 The doctrine of political question states:
            


 Baker v. Cart remains the starting point for analysis 
under the political question doctrine. There the US Supreme Court 
explained that:


 . . . Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found 
a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department 
or a 
lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it
, or the 
impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion
; or the 
impossibility
 of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack
 of the respect due coordinate branches of government
; or an 
unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made
; or the 
potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on question.


 In TaÃ±ada v. Cuenco, we held that 
political questions refer
 "to 
those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity
, or in regard to which 
full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of the government
. It is concerned with 
issues dependent upon the wisdom, not legality of a particular measure.
"
[41]




 I am of the view that RA 11469 has 
exclusively committed
 to the Executive Branch 
actions
 and 
decisions 
pertaining to the 
courses of action
 to meet the perils brought by COVID-19.
            
 The 
release on bail
 of pre-judgment PDLs not otherwise qualified for release 
but for the perils
 of the virus and the disease,
 involves an act of discretion
 falling under RA 11469. The country is in 
actual standstill 
because of COVID-19. Necessarily,
 if the Court is to act because of the virus and its disease
, the Court 
has to defer
 to the 
wisdom of the Executive Branch
, because our legal order
 has exclusively tasked it 
to combat the 
very cause of and reason
 
for 
the action prayed for by petitioners.
            
 In the ultimate analysis, even the
 issues that we can decide on our own
 as an institution,
 i.e.,

 whether petitioners would again commit a crime or would be available 
for the next court date or their release would bring our administration 
of justice into disrepute, are also 
intricately connected to
 the over-all response to the pandemic.
            
 This is 
because
 once petitioners are released, the courts 
will have to rely on the Executive Branch and its officers
 to monitor and enforce compliance with the bail plan. This will be 
especially complicated

 during this period of national health emergency when everyone in the 
Executive Branch is focused on fighting the virus and the disease it 
brings. Further, it is the 
Executive Branch
 that 
has the resources
 to commit and spend for 
alternative custodial arrangements
 to keep petitioners safe from COVID-19.
            
 The
 doctrine of primary jurisdiction
 articulates that "courts will 
hold off from determining
 a controversy involving a
 question
 within the jurisdiction of an administrative agency, particularly when
 its resolution demands the special knowledge, experience, and services
 of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact."
[42]
 The country's law has 
now entrusted to the Executive Branch, especially the IATF
, the authority to decide upon how to go about 
combatting
 the spread of the virus and its disease 
everywhere, 
including our courts, penitentiaries and detention or holding facilities
. Full discretionary authority
 has been 
delegated
 to this administrative office as regards this broad matter, by virtue of its 
expertise
 and 
specialized knowledge
.
            
 I say with a great deal of confidence that there would 
potentially
 be a
 great deal of embarrassment and confusion
 should there be 
multifarious pronouncements
 by various departments on this pressing concern. More, these pronouncements could be 
deadly
 and 
costly
 if made 
unilaterally without coordination
 or 
consultation with
 the Executive Branch.
            






Balancing varied interests â a summary.








Of all 
the issues I have canvassed
 vis-Ã -vis
 
petitioners' plea to be released on bail for a specified amount or upon recognizance, the 
things that have been established 
are:








-


the 
extremely contagious nature
 of 
COVID-19
,






-


the 
likelihood of transmission
 of the virus and the disease
 inside detention facilities among PDLs
, 
unless intervention measures are put in place,






-


the 
difficulties in achieving physical distancing, providing protective gears
, and
 accessing frequent handwashing
, 






-


the 
increased risk to petitioners
 as a result of their 
detention
 and 
pre-existing medical conditions
,






-


respondents' 
concrete earnest efforts
 to 
prevent
 the
 transmission of
 and the
 infection with COVID-19
 of 
PDLs
 including petitioners, and






-


the 
absence of confirmed cases

 of COVID-19 at MMDJ-4 at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, the Taguig City
 Jail-Female Dormitory, Manila City Jail-Female Dorm, and the Manila 
City Jail-Male Dormitory.








While the facts about the 
extreme contagious nature
 of COVID-19 are real, and 
existing concerns about the state of our detention facilities
 are 
highly relevant
, they are 
not
 the only factors 
determinative
 or 
dispositive
 of petitioners' plea.


 We also 
have to take into account
 respondents' and other jail wardens' 
concrete efforts to put into place protective measures
 against the virus.
            
 Further, there is a 
host of other issues I believe petitioners have to address
, for which 
they provided no answers
, and to date 
have not suggested
 any.
            
 In
 summary
, in these very challenging times, even as we 
fully recognize
 the potential 
harmful health impact on detained persons
 of the virus, the Court 
must balance
 
what respondents in particular have been doing and will do to keep PDLs healthy and alive as well as the legal requirements
 of, one, 
adhering
 to the 
legislated policy
 of having 
just the compass of the Executive Branch as the single baton
 in the united fight against COVID-19 for our common collective protection, and two, 
sustaining
 
our role
 in the 
proper functioning
 of our 
legal system
 and the 
administration of justice
.
            




Separate Opinion of Justice Delos Santos â some points to ponder upon...
 






For the most part, I concur in the 
Separate Opinion

 of my esteemed colleague, Justice Delos Santos. May I however 
respectfully forward some of my thoughts on a very few items that in my 
humble opinion could be subject to unintended interpretations.
            
 
One.
 I disagree with the reasoning that:
            


 First, the general import of the terms in Section 4 
(a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act in relation to the Nelson Mandela 
Rules clearly show that such provision is not judicially-enforceable.

      . . . .

      The phrase "in compliance with established United Nations standards" in Section 4 (a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act is 
so
 
generic
 that it clearly appears to be 
silent regarding the manner of its implementation
. . . .

      . . . .

      As to the issue of specific implementation, the following phrases 
of the afore-cited Nelson Mandela Rules stand out: (a) "reasonable 
accommodation and adjustments;" (b) "full and effective access to prison
 life on an equitable basis;" (c) "shall meet all requirements of 
health;" (d) "cubic content of air, minimum floor space, lighting, 
heating and ventilation;" (e) "special accommodation;" and (f) 
"[a]rrangements shall be made." All of these phrases do not provide 
specific details as to the manner of implementation...


 Second, the implementation of the Bureau of 
Corrections Act is dependent on the available funds of the Bureau, 
(emphases supplied)




 To begin with, primary and subordinate legislations 
would almost always be couched in general terms that understandably 
would lack details. Such terms as "reasonable," "equitable," 
"circumstances" and others are so common among public and private legal 
instruments, 
but it does not mean
 that these otherwise binding documents would 
not be judicially enforceable
.
            
 To illustrate, the definitions of "probable cause" 
and the various other standards of proof (e.g., beyond a reasonable 
doubt, preponderant evidence, substantial evidence) use the same words 
as "reasonable," "circumstances," etc., 
yet we never ever complained
 that we cannot enforce them.
            
 Indeed, such ambiguous terms are meant to be 
questions of fact
 whose 
resolution
 must be grounded in the specific facts and circumstances established by evidence or supporting allegations. Their ambiguity is 
clarified

 by the process of receiving evidence or submissions, and in the end, a 
court is able to define what "reasonable" and "equitable" concretely 
signify.
            
 Hence, in one case, this Court was confronted with 
the issue of "whether there is a 'counteraction' of forces between the 
union and the company and whether each of the parties exerted 
'reasonable effort at good faith bargaining'"
[43] 
but we did not decline to rule on this issue because of the ambiguity of the standard
.
 Instead, we said "whether there was already deadlock between the union 
and the company is likewise a question of fact. It requires the 
determination of evidence to find..."
            
 I also 
disagree
 with the thought that 
budgetary restrictions and considerations
 are factors in determining the 
existence
 of a right and its 
enforceability
. I will of course be the first to 
concede
 that in the 
"implementation"
 of a statutory program, 
budget becomes a critical factor
. But this weighing does 
not
 happen at the 
initial stage
 where the 
existence
 of a right and its 
enforceability
 are being determined.
 Budget
 could be a 
factor
 in 
fashioning
 the 
appropriate remedy
 or 
relief
, and 
assessing
 the
 reasonableness
 of the 
compliance

 after
 a
 right
 has been determined to

 and to be 
enforceable
.
            
 In any event, please
 recall
 that in one of the Court's more celebrated decisions, we decreed:
            


 WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The September 28, 
2005 Decision of the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 76528 and SP No. 74944 and the
 September 13, 2002 Decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. 1851-99 are 
AFFIRMED but with MODIFICATIONS in view of subsequent developments or 
supervening events in the case. The
 fallo
 of the RTC Decision shall now read:


 WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the 
abovenamed defendant-government agencies to clean up, rehabilitate, and 
preserve Manila Bay, and restore and maintain its waters to SB level 
(Class B sea waters per Water Classification Tables under DENR 
Administrative Order No. 34 [1990]) to make them fit for swimming, 
skin-diving, and other forms of contact recreation.


 In particular:


 (1) Pursuant to Sec. 4 of EO 192, assigning the DENR 
as the primary agency responsible for the conservation, management, 
development, and proper use of the country's environment and natural 
resources, and Sec. 19 of RA 9275, designating the DENR as the primary 
government agency responsible for its enforcement and implementation, 
the DENR is directed to fully implement its Operational Plan for the 
Manila Bay Coastal Strategy for the rehabilitation, restoration, and 
conservation of the Manila Bay at the earliest possible time. It is 
ordered to call regular coordination meetings with concerned government 
departments and agencies to ensure the successful implementation of the 
aforesaid plan of action in accordance with its indicated completion 
schedules.


 (2) Pursuant to Title XII (Local Government) of the 
Administrative Code of 1987 and Sec. 25 of the Local Government Code of 
1991, 42 the DILG, in exercising the President's power of general 
supervision and its duty to promulgate guidelines in establishing waste 
management programs under Sec. 43 of the Philippine Environment Code (PD
 1152), shall direct all LGUs in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, 
Bulacan, Pampanga, and Bataan to inspect all factories, commercial 
establishments, and private homes along the banks of the major river 
systems in their respective areas of jurisdiction, such as but not 
limited to the Pasig-Marikina-San Juan Rivers, the NCR 
(ParaÃ±aque-Zapote, Las PiÃ±as) Rivers, the 
Navotas-Malabon-Tullahan-Tenejeros Rivers, the Meycauayan-Marilao-Obando
 (Bulacan) Rivers, the Talisay (Bataan) River, the Imus (Cavite) River, 
the Laguna De Bay, and other minor rivers and waterways that eventually 
discharge water into the Manila Bay; and the lands abutting the bay, to 
determine whether they have wastewater treatment facilities or hygienic 
septic tanks as prescribed by existing laws, ordinances, and rules and 
regulations. If none be found, these LGUs shall be ordered to require 
non-complying establishments and homes to set up said facilities or 
septic tanks within a reasonable time to prevent industrial wastes, 
sewage water, and human wastes from flowing into these rivers, 
waterways, esteros, and the Manila Bay, under pain of closure or 
imposition of fines and other sanctions.


 (3) As mandated by Sec. 8 of RA 9275,43 the MWSS is 
directed to provide, install, operate, and maintain the necessary 
adequate waste water treatment facilities in Metro Manila, Rizal, and 
Cavite where needed at the earliest possible time.


 (4) Pursuant to RA 9275,44 the LWUA, through the local
 water districts and in coordination with the DENR, is ordered to 
provide, install, operate, and maintain sewerage and sanitation 
facilities and the efficient and safe collection, treatment, and 
disposal of sewage in the provinces of Laguna, Cavite, Bulacan, 
Pampanga, and Bataan where needed at the earliest possible time.


 (5) Pursuant to Sec. 65 of RA 8550, 45 the DA, through
 the BFAR, is ordered to improve and restore the marine life of the 
Manila Bay. It is also directed to assist the LGUs in Metro Manila, 
Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Bataan in developing, 
using recognized methods, the fisheries and aquatic resources in the 
Manila Bay.


 (6) The PCG, pursuant to Secs. 4 and 6 of PD 979, and 
the PNP Maritime Group, in accordance with Sec. 124 of RA 8550, in 
coordination with each other, shall apprehend violators of PD 979, RA 
8550, and other existing laws and regulations designed to prevent marine
 pollution in the Manila Bay.


 (7) Pursuant to Secs. 2 and 6-c of EO 513 and the 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the
 PPA is ordered to immediately adopt such measures to prevent the 
discharge and dumping of solid and liquid wastes and other 
ship-generated wastes into the Manila Bay waters from vessels docked at 
ports and apprehend the violators.


 (8) The MMDA, as the lead agency and implementor of 
programs and projects for flood control projects and drainage services 
in Metro Manila, in coordination with the DPWH, DILG, affected LGUs, PNP
 Maritime Group, Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council 
(HUDCC), and other agencies, shall dismantle and remove all structures, 
constructions, and other encroachments established or built in violation
 of RA 7279, and other applicable laws along the Pasig-Marikina-San Juan
 Rivers, the NCR (ParaÃ±aque-Zapote, Las PiÃ±as) Rivers, the Navotas- 
Malabon-Tullahan-Tenejeros Rivers, and connecting waterways and esteros 
in Metro Manila. The DPWH, as the principal implementor of programs and 
projects for flood control services in the rest of the country more 
particularly in Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Cavite, and Laguna, in 
coordination with the DILG, affected LGUs, PNP Maritime Group, HUDCC, 
and other concerned government agencies, shall remove and demolish all 
structures, constructions, and other encroachments built in breach of RA
 7279 and other applicable laws along the Meycauayan-Marilao-Obando 
(Bulacan) Rivers, the Talisay (Bataan) River, the Imus (Cavite) River, 
the Laguna De Bay, and other rivers, connecting waterways, and esteros 
that discharge wastewater into the Manila Bay.


 In addition, the MMDA is ordered to establish, 
operate, and maintain a sanitary landfill, as prescribed by RA 9003, 
within a period of one (1) year from finality of this Decision. On 
matters within its territorial jurisdiction and in connection with the 
discharge of its duties on the maintenance of sanitary landfills and 
like undertakings, it is also ordered to cause the apprehension and 
filing of the appropriate criminal cases against violators of the 
respective penal provisions of RA 9003, Sec. 27 of RA 9275 (the Clean 
Water Act), and other existing laws on pollution.


 (9) The DOH shall, as directed by Art. 76 of PD 1067 
and Sec. 8 of RA 9275, within one (1) year from finality of this 
Decision, determine if all licensed septic and sludge companies have the
 proper facilities for the treatment and disposal of fecal sludge and 
sewage coming from septic tanks. The DOH shall give the companies, if 
found to be non-complying, a reasonable time within which to set up the 
necessary facilities under pain of cancellation of its environmental 
sanitation clearance.


 (10) Pursuant to Sec. 53 of PD 1152, 48 Sec. 118 of RA
 8550, and Sec. 56 of RA 9003, 49 the DepEd shall integrate lessons on 
pollution prevention, waste management, environmental protection, and 
like subjects in the school curricula of all levels to inculcate in the 
minds and hearts of students and, through them, their parents and 
friends, the importance of their duty toward achieving and maintaining a
 balanced and healthful ecosystem in the Manila Bay and the entire 
Philippine archipelago.


 (11) The DBM shall consider incorporating an adequate 
budget in the General Appropriations Act of 2010 and succeeding years to
 cover the expenses relating to the cleanup, restoration, and 
preservation of the water quality of the Manila Bay, in line with the 
country's development objective to attain economic growth in a manner 
consistent with the protection, preservation, and revival of our marine 
waters.


 (12) The heads of petitioners-agencies MMDA, DENR, 
DepEd, DOH, DA, DPWH, DBM, PCG, PNP Maritime Group, DILG, and also of 
MWSS, LWUA, and PPA, in line with the principle of "continuing 
mandamus", shall, from finality of this Decision, each submit to the 
Court a quarterly progressive report of the activities undertaken in 
accordance with this Decision.


 No costs.
[44]




 The kilometric dispositive portion 
will at once tell us
 that the concerned entities will 
have to spend some money
, which calls for a budget, to be able to comply with what the Court has ruled to be the
 rightful entitlements
 of the claimants therein. It was
 never an issue to the Court

 that in determining the existence of a right and in enforcing it, we 
may be requiring some government agencies to spend some resources to 
promote, protect and defend the right.
            
 In truth, nothing ought to
 restrict
 the Court from
 adjudicating
 the 
existence
 of a right and its 
enforceability
 on the 
basis
 of the 
availability
 of 
budget
 for the
 implementation
 of a right. We should be able to 
distinguish
 one from the other and to 
keep sacred
 this 
dichotomy
.
            
 
Second.
 I disagree with the rationale that:
            


 Presently, there is 
no
 constitutional provision or law which
 automatically

 grants bail, releases on recognizance or allows other modes of 
temporary liberty to all accused or inmates who are 
clinically-vulnerable (i.e. sickly, elderly or pregnant). As it stands, 
courts concerned will still have to consider the following guidelines 
for bail in Sections 5 and 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal 
Procedure....


 The above-mentioned enumeration clearly pertain to 
purely factual questions

 that trial courts are equipped to pass upon. Moreover, the 
consideration of these factors which includes others not mentioned but 
are analogous to the ones provided means that such guidelines 
do not work in isolation
. (emphases supplied)




 The cited rule pertains to the 
determination
 of the
 amount of bail
 where bail is a 
matter of right
. It has no application where 
bail is a matter of discretion
 as a result of the imposable penalties upon the crime charged where evidence of guilt is strong.
            
 I
 do not wish to impart 
the idea that Section 9, Rule 114 
per se
 is a
 list of factors
 to be weighed 
every time
 a 
petition for bail
 is filed. Section 9 becomes relevant 
only when
 the ruling in 
Enrile
 is
 applicable
 in the sense
 of being
 the standard for resolving the case
, particularly, in determining whether the 
Enrile
 
two-step test

 is complied with: (a) that the detainee will not be a flight risk or a 
danger to the community; and (b) that there exist special, humanitarian 
and compelling circumstances. The 
Section 9 factors
 are good indicators, among others, of the existence of these elements in the 
Enrile
 test
.
            
 
In this connection
, I disagree with the statement that:
            


 
Fourth
, the Court's ruling in 
Enrile
 
v. Sandiganbayan, et al.
 is inapplicable in the instant case.

      . . . .

      In 
Enrile
, the Court emphasized that while
 the Philippines honors its "commitment to uphold the fundamental human 
rights as well as value the worth and dignity of every person," the 
grant of bail to those charged in criminal proceedings as well as 
extraditees must be based upon a clear and convincing showing: 
(a) that the detainee will 
not
 be a 
flight risk
 or a 
danger
 to the 
community
; 
and
 (b) 
that there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances....


 Here, the petitioners do not deny the allegations of 
the OSG that they are indeed charged with heinous crimes related to 
national security and are also valuable members of the CPP-NPA-NDF and 
its affiliates. Even if the alleged facts underlying humanitarian 
reasons were to be accepted without question, they still have to be 
weighed against the fact that the charges against the petitioners 
involve serious matters of national security and public safety.... As a 
consequence, the petitioners' reliance on this ruling is patently 
misguided....


 Even assuming for the sake of argument that the 
petitioners had managed to attach documents proving the foregoing pieces
 of information, the determination of whether or not guilt is strong 
should still be lodged with the trial courts who are well-equipped to 
handle them.... (emphases and underscoring supplied)




 
As submitted earlier, 
Enrile
 applies here, 
not in the sense
 that herein petitioners would also be entitled to be released on a bail plan, 
but in the sense
 that 
Enrile
 is a legally binding decision, a law, that must
 apply equally to all
 who are able to meet the standards that 
Enrile
 espouses. To conclude 
otherwise
 is to 
institutionalize
 the 
forbidden thought
 that 
some people are better treated in and under the law than others upon dubious grounds
.
            
 Thus, herein petitioners are 
correct in invoking
 
Enrile
 but 
may still be not released
 on bail for a specified amount or on recognizance 
unless they are able to muster
 the
 two-step test
 in 
Enrile
: (a) the detainee will 
not be a flight risk
 or 
a
 
danger
 to the community; and (b)
 there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances.
 The
 test
 in 
Enrile
 has 
nothing
 to do with
 assessing
 whether or not the 
evidence 
of 
petitioners' guilt
 is 
strong
, but on 
other factors 
as mentioned above.
            
 
Third.
 I disagree with the rationale that:
            


 In the case of the petitioners' continued confinement in their respective detention facilities, 
the
 Court cannot issue an order for the creation of a "Prisoner Release 
Committee" in the absence of any law and in the absence of any concluded
 bail hearing which resulted in the grant of provisional liberty
. As it stands, 
only
 the political branches of government (Executive and Legislative) have 
the power to determine for themselves if such recourse is warranted.

 The only act that the Court may do under the circumstances is to order 
the conduct bail hearings before the trial courts with dispatch....




 I have my 
misgivings
 if the
 political
 branches of government have the
 authority to order the release of PDLs
, or for that matter, 
their continued detention
, if, 
in the former
, the evidence of guilt is strong for a crime punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment or there has been 
yet no determination
 thereof in a hearing, or if,
 in the latter
, it has been 
decided after a hearing
 that the evidence of guilt is 
not 
strong for a crime punishable by death,
 reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment. 
The determination in this regard exclusively belongs to the courts.


 
Fourth.
 I also disagree with this statement:
            


 Besides, whenever a conundrum arises 
in times of emergency

 when police power collides with constitutionally-protected freedoms or 
fundamental rights, the political questions doctrine will often tip the 
balance in favor of general welfare acts or policies in view of the 
State's duty to primarily protect general interests...
 However
,
 while public safety is the paramount and overriding concern of the 
State and while it is also true that laws should be interpreted in favor
 of the greatest good of the greatest number during emergencies, 
individual freedoms also have to be respected
... (Emphases supplied)




 I
 do not want 
to give the 
misimpression
 that
 petitioners will remain in detention
 because "
whenever
 a conundrum arises in times of emergency when police power collides 
with constitutionally-protected freedoms or fundamental rights, the 
political questions doctrine 
will often tip the balance
 
in favor of general welfare acts or policies in view of the State's duty to primarily protect general interests
." This is farthest from the truth. They will 
stay under detention
 because they 
failed to satisfy the requirements
 that would have otherwise qualified them to be released.
            
 More, I am not comfortable with the idea that 
during emergencies
, the Court will already desist from acting in favour of individual rights since
 the political question doctrine
 
will often tip the balance
. This is a recipe for authoritarianism which I am sure even respondents and the OSG are not advocating at present.
            
 
Fifth.
 I disagree with the references 
to the following conclusions which may have an impact on the trial of 
petitioners' criminal cases below:
            


 Here, the petitioners do not deny the allegations of the OSG that they are indeed charged with heinous crimes related to 
national security
 and are also valuable members of the CPP-NPA-NDF and its affiliates...

      ....

      ...As earlier discussed, the government cannot afford to gamble 
its chances and resources by allowing the petitioners who are allegedly 
key members of the CPP-NPA-NDF to roam free while the COVID-19 pandemic 
remains an imminent and grave threat...




 I would 
not
 have wanted us to give so much 
thought and weight to petitioners' status as rebels when as the Separate
 Opinion itself states this matter as being 
merely an allegation
 
(i.e., the Separate Opinion uses the descriptor "alleged") and more 
importantly when this is an issue being litigated at the trial courts 
below. It would have 
sufficed to focus
 on 
petitioners' collective inability to provide concrete circumstances and bail plan
 to prove the first-prong of the 
Enrile
 test.
            




No one left behind, healing as one â fashioning the appropriate relief.
 






We are 
not in ordinary times
. Also, 
time
 is
 not on anyone's side
. The reason lies in the 
nature of the enemy
 we are all facing. The spread or transmission rate of COVID-19, to use lay language, is "
less than a week
 and that 
more than 10 percent of patients are infected by somebody
 who has the virus but 
does not yet have symptoms
."
[45]
 As further explained by 
WHO
:
            


 Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?


 The speed of transmission is an important point of 
difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median 
incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) 
and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than 
COVID-19 virus. 
The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days
, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that
 influenza can spread faster than COVID19
.
 Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially 
pre-symptomatic transmission -transmission of the virus before the 
appearance of symptoms - is a major driver of transmission for 
influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that
 there are 
people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, 
at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. 
The reproductive number â the number of secondary infections generated 
from one infected individual â is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for
 COVID-19 virus
, higher than for influenza.... 
Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community.
 For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that

 children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates 
in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household 
transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from 
adults, rather than vice versa....
 For COVID-19, data to date 
suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe 
infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring 
ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be 
higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk
 for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, 
those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are 
immunosuppressed. 
For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.
[46]




 The 
ubiquitous advice
 about this pandemic is that, 
unlike in other situations where time heals
,
 time
 is 
not
 our 
best ally
. 
Transmission
 is
 rapid
 and 
easy
. The
 host and carrier
 does 
not
 carry a badge for easy identification. Those who
 look healthy
 can be just that, mere appearance of health.
            
 I therefore 
do not criticize 
petitioners for resorting directly to this Court. As correctly held by the 
ponencia
, the 
doctrine of the hierarchy of courts
 does 
not apply
 to the present circumstances.
            
 
Fortunately
, respondents have responded well to the call for
 preventive measures
 against COVID-19 at our detention centers. From all indications, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, respondents 
have acquitted
 themselves well in this regard. It is my hope that they 
remain aggressive against 
the virus and 
continue keeping
 the PDLs safe from the disease. Their 
timely response answers petitioners' rightful concerns 
against this invisible enemy.
            
 It is my understanding from the petition that at the time of filing, 
petitioner Reina Mae Nasino
 was 
five-months pregnant
. She must have given birth by now. I do not know if her baby now stays with her. But if the baby does, it is 
entitled to separate protection
 apart from its mother, petitioner Nasino, would be entitled to.
            
 
Hence
, while I 
recognize
 and
 adhere to
 the 
primordial if not exclusive
 role of the Executive Branch in the fight against COVID-19, I believe that we have 
a role to play in protecting the baby
 from adverse consequences that are 
not of the baby's own doing
. After all, 
her mother
 is in this state of panic 
because
 the 
lower court
 has 
issued processes
 for her preventive detention; further, she and her 
co-petitioners
 are invoking their entitlement to 
bail under the circumstances
; and, lastly, the 
health
 of the
 baby 
is exposed to a 
greater
 risk of infection than those who are staying with their mothers outside the detention facilities. To use the hyperbole of 
Human Rights Watch
, the baby's situation is 
akin to
 having a 
death sentence
 imposed upon it 
by mere accident
 or 
as an innocent by-stander
.
[47]


 In 
Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice
,
[48]
 the Court 
affirmed
 that the 
power to save the life of a human being
 is 
not exclusive
 to any of the three branches of government. The Court said poignantly: "
The
 powers of the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary to save the 
life of a death convict do not exclude each other for the simple reason 
that there is no higher right than the right to life
."
            
 Our jurisprudence has also 
confirmed
 that 
"the Court is, under the Constitution, empowered to promulgate rules for
 the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights,"
[49]
 the most prominent being the
 right to life
. With the Court's authority to promulgate formal rules for this purpose, with more reason
 the Court can exercise
 
and not resile from
 the
 jurisdiction
 to put its two cents' worth whenever a 
person's life
 or 
health
 â in this case, that of the 
baby
 of a pre-judgment PDL â is 
also at stake
 from 
circumstances not of her own making
.
            
 The 
greater risks
 that the present pandemic have caused are the 
actual facts
 that
 fuel
 the 
present controversy
 which makes it 
justiciable
. Let me stress. There is 
nothing advisory, nothing philosophical, nothing dreamy

 about the COVID-19. We have been quarantined for almost half of this 
year already, our courts and others have lost the equivalent of about 
six-months of man-hours, 
all because of the REAL dangers 
to
 life, health and overall well-being of the entire population of the 
Philippines and the entire world. I would like the Court to give relief 
to petitioner Nasino's baby 
not because
 of the ineptitude of respondents, but as a result of the 
reality
 of the 
greater risks
 facing 
petitioner Nasino's baby
 coming from
 facts
 about this 
pandemic
.
            
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote to 
TREAT
 the 
present petition as petitioners' applications for bail or recognizance 
as well as their motions for other confinement arrangements, and 
REFER
 the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal cases are pending, which courts should be 
DIRECTED
 to conduct the necessary proceedings and consequently, resolve these incidents with utmost dispatch.

 quoting Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Robert J. Sharpe's address on 
October 1st, 1997 to a National Judicial Institute conference of 
Justices of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on the application and
 impact of judicial discretion in commercial litigation.  
            
 
[20]
 
Article 9. No judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason 
of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws. (6)   
            
[21]
 
Article 10. In case of doubt in the interpretation or application of 
laws, it is presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice 
to prevail.  
            
 
[22]
 By 
way of an aside, I see this interpretation and practice to be skewed for
 being clearly inconsistent with texts of the constitutional provision 
and the Rules of Court and the effect of the allocation of the burden of
 proof. As written:
            


 Constitution, Article III, Section 13. All persons,
 except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong
, shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law....


 Rules of Court, Rule 114, Section 7. Capital offense 
or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, not
 bailable. â 
No person
 charged with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, 
shall be admitted to bail when evidence of guilt is strong
, regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution. 






 The texts say that bail is to be denied when the 
evidence of guilt is strong. There is a precursor to the denial of bail.
 More, the burden is on the prosecution to establish that precursor. The
 burden signifies that a court is not to presume that the evidence of 
guilt is strong. The prosecution has to actually discharge its burden by
 proving that the evidence of guilt is strong. Prior to satisfying this 
standard of proof, it cannot be the case that bail is already denied, 
because bail can be denied only after the prosecution has already 
discharged its burden by proving that the evidence of guilt is strong. 
Prior to satisfying this standard of proof, the default is the 
availability of bail as a matter of right. This, however, is just my 
irreverent opinion about this aside.

SEPARATE OPINION


 
ZALAMEDA, 
J
.:
 


On 08 March 2020, the President issued Presidential 
Proclamation (PP) 922 declaring a state of public health emergency 
throughout the Philippines upon confirmation by the Secretary of Health 
of local transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
[1]
 The present Petition was filed on 09 April 2020, a month after the issuance of PP 922. 


 Fearful that the contagion will catch up to them while 
in detention, petitioners seek succor from this Court, asking for 
temporary liberty through bail or personal recognizance based on equity 
(Sections 1
[2]
 and 5(5)
[3]
 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, in relation to Rule 3, Section 1
[4]

 of A.M. No. 10-4-20-SC). The Petition is filed directly before this 
Court as an exception to the procedures on applications for bail
[5]
 or personal recognizance,
[6]
 as well as the different modes of judicial review under the Rules of Court.
            
 Petitioners describe themselves as belonging to the 
"vulnerable or at-risk groups [to contract COVID-19] by reason of their 
medical and/or physical conditions"
[7]

 and are "currently committed in places of detention where it is 
impossible to practice self-isolation, social distancing, and other 
COVID-19 precautions."
[8]
 The table

 The Petition raises just one issue: whether petitioners,
 who are elderly, sickly, and with other medical conditions, should be 
released on humanitarian considerations in the context of COVID-19.
[11]
 Meanwhile, this Court formulated the following issues during deliberations:


 Whether the instant Petition filed directly before this Court may be given due course.
Whether the Nelson Mandela Rules are enforceable in Philippine courts.
Whether the petitioners may be given provisional liberty on the ground of equity.
Whether the Court has the power to pass upon the 
State's prerogative of selecting appropriate police power measures in 
times of emergency.
[12]
 


I vote to DENY the Petition.
            




Petitioners' Direct Recourse to this Court for Provisional Liberty on the Ground of Equity
 






The determination on the propriety of the instant 
Petition for provisional liberty may be given due course on the ground 
of equity, upon an inquiry on the following: 1) jurisdiction of the 
Court over applications for bail or recognizance; 2) compliance by 
petitioners with the procedures for applications for bail or 
recognizance; and 3) exemption of petitioners from complying with the 
procedures for such applications.
            
 
This Court is clearly not among those vested with
 jurisdiction over applications for bail or recognizance under the Rules
 and the law.
 The jurisdiction over both applications for bail and recognizance lies with the trial courts.
[13]

 To be sure, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure governs
 applications for bail, while Republic Act (RA) No. 10389 governs 
applications for recognizance.
            
 Also, the issues raised by petitioners, particularly
 those that entail the determination of the due execution and 
authenticity of their submitted documents, involve a determination of 
facts best addressed to the sound discretion of the trial courts. 
Indeed,
 petitioners ought to have submitted their applications for temporary 
release before the respective courts where their cases are pending.
 
And even if We are to take cognizance of the Petition, petitioners 
failed to substantiate their right to be released on bail or 
recognizance.
            
 In determining the amount of bail, the trial courts 
consider the following factors: financial ability of the accused to give
 bail; nature and circumstances of the offense; penalty for the offense 
charged; character and reputation of the accused; age and health of the 
accused; weight of the evidence against the accused; probability of the 
accused appearing at the trial; forfeiture of other bail; if the accused
 was a fugitive from justice when arrested; and pendency of other cases 
where the accused is on bail.
[14]


 On the other hand, RA 10389 lists the following 
requirements for an application for recognizance and the 
disqualifications for such application:  
            


SEC. 6. 
Requirements
. - The competent court 
where a criminal case has been filed against a person covered under this
 Act shall, upon motion, order the release of the detained person on 
recognizance to a qualified custodian: Provided, That all of the 
following requirements are complied with: 








(a)


A sworn 
declaration by the person in custody of his/her indigency or incapacity 
either to post a cash bail or proffer any personal or real property 
acceptable as sufficient sureties for a bail bond; 






(b)


A certification issued by 
the head of the social welfare and development office of the 
municipality or city where the accused actually resides, that the 
accused is indigent; 






(c)


The person in custody has been arraigned;






(d)


The court has notified the city or municipal sanggunian where the accused resides of the application for recognizance. x x x x






(e)


The accused shall be 
properly documented, through such processes as, but not limited to, 
photographic image reproduction of all sides of the face and 
fingerprinting: Provided, That the costs involved for the purpose of 
this subsection shall be shouldered by the municipality or city that 
sought the release of the accused as provided herein, chargeable to the 
mandatory five percent (5%) calamity fund in its budget or to any other 
available fund in its treasury; and






(f)


The court shall notify the 
public prosecutor of the date of hearing therefor within twenty-four 
(24) hours from the filing of the application for release on 
recognizance in favor of the accused: Provided, That such hearing shall 
be held not earlier than twenty-four (24) hours nor later than 
forty-eight (48) hours from the receipt of notice by the prosecutor: 
Provided, further, That during said hearing, the prosecutor shall be 
ready to submit the recommendations regarding the application made under
 this Act, wherein no motion for postponement shall be entertained.








 SEC. 7. 
Disqualifications for Release on Recognizance
.
 â Any of the following circumstances shall be a valid ground for the 
court to disqualify an accused from availing of the benefits provided 
herein: 








(a)


The accused bad made untruthful statements in his/her sworn affidavit prescribed under Section 5(a);






(b)


The accused is a 
recidivist, quasi-recidivist, habitual delinquent, or has committed a 
crime aggravated by the circumstance of reiteration;






(c)


The accused had been found 
to have previously escaped from legal confinement, evaded sentence or 
has violated the conditions of bail or release on recognizance without 
valid justification;






(d)


The accused had previously committed a crime while on probation, parole or under conditional pardon; 






(e)


The personal circumstances 
of the accused or nature of the facts surrounding his/her case indicate 
the probability of flight if released on recognizance;






(f)


There is a great risk that the accused may commit another crime during the pendency of the case; and






(g)


The accused has a pending criminal case which has the same or higher penalty to the new crime he/she is being accused of. 










Petitioners do not seek to invalidate the established 
requirements for bail or recognizance, but instead claim exception 
therefrom due to their peculiar circumstances. 
Evident, however, is petitioner's failure to comply with these clear and comprehensive requirements.

 Petitioners also significantly failed to present this Court with 
information if the crimes for which they had been detained are bailable,
 or their financial status qualifies them for recognizance, and/or they 
have a definite plan for their temporary release. 


 It was only after respondents narrated the circumstances
 relating to the charges against petitioners that the latter were 
compelled to provide the Court with a more detailed, but still 
incomplete, information. Petitioners still failed to indicate vital 
information, such as the actual case numbers, motions filed in relation 
to their age and health condition, and court orders corresponding to 
such motions. They did not even assert any pending applications for bail
 or recognizance before the trial courts, as well as other applications 
or custodial arrangements, or if such had been denied. 
            
 The initial lack of candor about the nature of the 
crimes charged, and the context for the filing thereof, invite questions
 as to the legitimacy of using the threat of contracting COVID-19 in 
petitioners' bid to gain liberty, temporary or otherwise. 
            
 As petitioners invoke this Court's exercise of 
equity jurisdiction, praying for exemption from the procedures of 
applications for bail or recognizance on humanitarian grounds, they 
present their respective ages and health statuses, as well as the 
existing conditions of their detention facilities to show that they are 
especially exposed and vulnerable to contract COVID-19. However, this 
prayer for exemption rests on flimsy grounds.
            
 Out of the 22 petitioners, 17 are senior citizens, 
or are 60 years of age and older. There are 12 male senior citizens with
 health issues,
[15]
 one male senior citizen without health issues,
[16]
 and three male non-senior citizens with health issues.
[17]
 There are two female senior citizens with health issues,
[18]
 two female senior citizens without health issues,
[19]

 and two female non-senior citizens with health issues. One of the two 
female non-senior citizens is five months pregnant at the time of the 
filing of the Petition but has since given birth,
[20]
 while the other has leprosy.
[21]
 The health issues of petitioners include diabetes and hypertension.
[22]
 
However,
 only 17 petitioners provided copies of their medical certificates, and 
only six medical certificates out of the 17 were issued in 2020. None of
 the petitioners have been tested for, or are alleged to have, COVID-19.


 The Petition described the physical situations in 
the Quezon City Jail, the Cebu City Jail, the Mandaue City Jail, and the
 New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa, to support their claim of 
exposure and vulnerability to contract COVID-19. Yet, none of the 
petitioners are confined in any of the said institutions. Petitioners 
are actually detained in four other different sites: MMDJ 4 in Camp 
Bagong Diwa, Taguig City Jail; Female Dorm, which is also in Camp Bagong
 Diwa, Taguig City Jail; Manila City Jail, and the CIW, in Mandaluyong 
City.
[23]


 Petitioners emphasize that their collective actual 
health situation and congested detention facilities put them at greater 
risk of contracting COVID-19. They harp upon these facts, but 
conveniently ignore the reality of the absence of any incident of 
COVID-19 infection in their actual detention facilities. While it is 
true that after the filing of the Petition, and during its pendency, 20 
PDLs and 1 staff tested positive for COVID-19 at the CIW where one of 
the petitioners is imprisoned, those who tested positive have since been
 transferred to the isolation facilities at the NBP.
[24]
 Thus, the actual risk of petitioners contracting COVID-19 is more speculative than real.
            
 
In seeking for their temporary release through 
bail or recognizance, petitioners are primarily asking this Court to 
turn a blind eye to the established requirements which take into account
 the nature and gravity of the crimes charged.
 Petitioners 
ultimately want the Court to controvert Art. III, Section 13 of the 1987
 Constitution, which provides that "[a]ll persons, except those charged 
with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 when evidence of 
guilt is strong, shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient 
sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law. x x 
x" Most of the petitioners are incarcerated for non-bailable crimes and 
offenses. Even conceding the extraordinary backdrop of this case, 
humanitarian reasons alone cannot justify the utter disregard of the 
Constitution, the law, and the rules of procedures.
            
 If only to belabor the point, judicial policy 
dictates that this Court will not entertain direct resort to it unless 
the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts or 
where exceptional and compelling circumstances justify availment of a 
remedy within and calling for the exercise of our primary jurisdiction.
[25]
 And since petitioners failed to show that they have exhausted the appropriate remedies before the lower courts, 
i.e.
,
 by filing applications for bail and recognizance therein, or compelling
 circumstances have exempted them from disregarding the hierarchy of 
courts, the Petition must be denied.
            




The Court issued Guidelines for Both the Temporary and Permanent Release of Qualified PDLs
 






Recognizing that We cannot assume the role of the trial 
courts concerning applications for bail or recognizance, the Court has 
issued circulars on the trial courts' conduct of procedures on both the 
temporary and permanent release of qualified persons deprived of liberty (PDLs).

 These circulars serve as further proof that the entire judiciary was in
 operation regardless of the threat of contracting COVID-19. In the same
 vein, this Court acknowledged the congestion in detention facilities 
nationwide and the consequent high risk of PDLs contracting COVID-19. 
This Court, by itself or through the Office of the Court Administrator 
(OCA), issued these circulars as part of its response to the demands 
brought about by COVID-19. 
            
 First, on 31 March 2020, we issued AC No. 33-2020
[26]

 directing the online filing of complaints or information, and posting 
of bail due to the rising number of COVID-19 infection. The OCA released
 the corresponding guidelines, OCA 89-2020,
[27]
 on 03 April 2020. Second, on 20 April 2020, the OCA issued OCA Circular No. 91-2020
[28]
 to address the 
temporary or permanent release of qualified PDLs
,
 reminding judges to adhere to the Guidelines for Decongesting Jails by 
Enforcing the Rights of the Accused Persons to Bail and to Speedy Trial 
(A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC, effective 1 May 2014),
[29]

 particularly Sections 5 (release after service of minimum imposable 
penalty) and 10 (provisional dismissal). Third, AC No. 38-2020
[30]
 dated 30 April 2020 set the guidelines for reduced bail and recognizance as modes for the 
temporary release of qualified PDLs
 during this public health emergency, pending resolution of their cases.
            
 As a result, 9,731 PDLs from 17 March to 29 April 
2020 were released nationwide. This number has since increased to 33,790
 as of 22 June 2020.
[31]
 The 
Chief Justice's far-reaching efforts to further decongest our detention 
facilities, especially in light of the situation brought about by 
COVID-19, is truly commendable. 
            
 Corollary to this Court's initiatives, on 15 April 2020,
[32]

 the Department of Justice (DOJ), through the Board of Pardons and 
Parole (BPP), issued Board Resolution No. OT-04-15-2020, or the Interim 
Rules on Parole and Executive Clemency (Interim Rules).
[33]
 The BPP addresses the congestion in the national penitentiaries by advocating the 
permanent release of qualified PDLs
. As of 10 June 2020, the DOJ's efforts resulted to 749 PDLs' release on parole and 356 PDLs' receipt of executive clemency.
[34]
 
The
 combined efforts of this Court, the OCA, and the DOJ has brought about 
the release of 34,895 PDLs from 17 March to 22 June 2020.






The Enforceability of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules in the Philippines vis-Ã -vis the State's 
Prerogative of Selecting Appropriate Police Power Measures in Times of 
Emergency
 






Petitioners cite Rules 13, 16, 18, 22, 24, 25, 27, 30, 
42, 109, and 111 of the Revised UN Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, or the Nelson Mandela Rules (Mandela Rules),
[35]
 in support of their claim that the State has the duty to protect the health and safety of its prisoners.
            
 The Mandela Rules, however, must be read in their 
entirety and in the proper context. The Expert Group that formulated the
 Mandela Rules articulated the standard of adequate systems in penal 
institutions. It also recognized that the said Rules are not capable of 
wholesale application in all places because of the difference in the 
legal, social, economic, and geographical situations in each country. 
The preliminary observations which preface the Nelson Mandela Rules bear
 witness to this recognition: 
            
 Preliminary observation 1
                
 The following rules are not intended to describe in 
detail a model system of penal institutions. They seek only, on the 
basis of the general consensus of contemporary thought and the essential
 elements of the most adequate systems of today, to set out what is 
generally accepted as being good principles and practice in the 
treatment of prisoners and prison management. 
                
 Preliminary observation 2
                
 1. 
In view of the great variety of legal, 
social, economic and geographical conditions in the world, it is evident
 that not all of the rules are capable of application in all places and 
at all times.
 They should, however, serve to stimulate a constant 
endeavor to overcome practical difficulties in the way of their 
application, in the knowledge that they represent, as a whole, the 
minimum conditions which are accepted as suitable by the United Nations.
 
                
 2. On the other hand, the rules cover a field in
 which thought is constantly developing. They are not intended to 
preclude experiment and practices, provided these are in harmony with 
the principles and seek to further the purposes which derive from the 
text of these rules as a whole. 
It will always be justifiable for the central prison administration to authorize departures from the rules in this spirit.
[36]



            These preliminary observations allow us to characterize the 
measures that this Court has undertaken for the temporary and permanent 
release of PDLs, as well as the practices introduced by the officials of
 the BJMP, under the Department of the Interior and Local Government 
(DILG), and the BuCor, under the DOJ,
[37]

 as part of our country's compliance with United Nations standards and 
as part of our country's response in catering to the needs of PDLs 
brought about by COVID-19.
[38]

 Section 4(a) of RA 10575, or The Bureau of Corrections Act of 2013, 
expressly states that "the safekeeping of inmates shall include decent 
provision of quarters, food, water, and clothing in compliance with 
United Nations standards."
            
 The BJMP and the BuCor have prohibited jail visits since March 2020 to minimize PDLs' exposure to the COVID-19 virus.
[39]
 They have also implemented a "no 
paabot
" policy prohibiting bringing food and other personal items into the detention facilities and penal institutions.
[40]
 Aside from information campaigns involving both personnel and PDLs,
[41]
 there have been activities such as distribution of vitamins to personnel
[42]
 and PDLs,
[43]
 production of face masks,
[44]
 and distribution of sanitation and disinfection materials.
[45]
 PDLs are also given the means for electronic money transfer
[46]
 and for video calls (
e-dalaw
).
[47]


 Measures put in place for addressing tuberculosis in
 Philippine detention facilities have been replicated to address 
probable COVID-19 cases. These measures include conducting infection 
control protocols (proper entry screening
[48]

 and mass screenings inside detention facilities), creating isolation 
units for infected patients to halt further spread of the disease,
[49]
 and installing quarantine areas for discharged patients.
[50]
 Medical practitioners assigned to detention facilities and penal institutions have been identified.
[51]

 PDLs who are sick, especially those who have fever, cough, and colds, 
undergo medical consultations at the designated isolation areas.
[52]

 The PDLs who tested positive in the CIW have been admitted to the 
Mandaluyong City Medical Center and the National Kidney and Transplant 
Institute.
[53]
 Psycho-social activities,
[54]
 including psychotherapy,
[55]
 are continuously conducted.
            
 Petitioners also enumerated the countries that 
released PDLs because of the fear of the spread of COVID-19 infections. 
We would like to point out that the release of PDLs who are similarly 
situated to petitioners in terms of age and health should be done with 
extreme caution. Utmost prudence in releasing PDLs with health issues 
and senior citizens is justified as their release may further endanger 
their health.
[56]
 Petitioners,
 however, did not show whether they will be in a better physical 
environment, or be better protected, upon gaining their temporary 
freedom. Petitioners did not even inform this Court of the COVID-19 
situation in the areas they propose to stay during their temporary 
release. 
            
 Moreover, the countries
[57]

 that released PDLs followed a stringent set of criteria in determining 
who may be released, such as the kind of cases filed, the length of the 
sentence served, and a plan for release. Only a few of these countries 
have released their political prisoners. Iran granted leave to thousands
 of PDLs, including political prisoners, sometime in March and extended 
this leave until 20 May 2020.
[58]

 The grant was based allegedly on dubious terms of good behavior and 
payment of exorbitant bail. As a result, several prisoners have since 
returned to prison despite the extension.
[59]

 Egypt released four women who were accused of "inciting a protest," 
"disseminating false information," and "possession of material 
disseminating false information" after payment of bail. Egypt also 
released 15 politicians and activists who had been "arbitrarily 
detained" for months.
[60]
 Some of Egypt's political prisoners who remain in detention have been tested for COVID-19.
[61]

 However, tens of thousands remain in prison for peacefully exercising 
their rights to freedom of expression, protest, and assembly.
[62]
 The crimes for which Egypt's political prisoners are indicted sharply contrast with those of petitioners. 
            
 
A Final Word


 The situation that the world faces is unprecedented.
 These are challenging times, but the Judiciary has been equal to the 
task, albeit with the recognition that there is still much to be done. 
While the health crisis persists, the Judiciary, along with the 
Executive and the Legislative branches, need to re-visit their policies,
 re-calibrate their actions, and promptly react to the emerging needs of
 the times. 
            
 Still, the Court cannot act contrary to, or in 
excess of, its own authority, no matter how noble the intention. To 
insist on equity and liberality while forsaking laws, rules, and 
established procedures is self-defeating. Justice must always be served 
"according to the mandate of the law."
[63]
 No one benefits from undermining the whole system.
            
 The Judiciary and the Executive have made, and continue to take, the necessary action for both
 temporary and permanent release of qualified PDLs
.
 The pleas of petitioners and of various organizations to decongest and 
improve the conditions of Philippine jails did not fall on deaf ears. 
The actions of this Court, the BPP, the BJMP, and the BuCor are 
testament to the collective recognition that decongestion is a problem 
needing to be addressed regardless of the existence of a public health 
emergency. Moreover, the ideals expressed in international instruments 
on the treatment of prisoners, like the Nelson Mandela Rules, should 
constantly be taken into account in crafting laws and in the formulation
 of policies.
            
 In view of the foregoing, I vote to DENY the Petition.

 SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.


 Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of 
justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are 
legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not 
there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess 
of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the 
Government.

 SECTION 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers: 




x x x x

      (5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of 
constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, 
the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal 
assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified
 and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be
 uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, 
increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special 
courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless 
disapproved by the Supreme Court.




 
[4]
 RULE 3: THE EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL FUNCTION   
            
SECTION 1. The Supreme Court [is] a court of law. 
-The Court is a court of law. Its primary task is to resolve and decide 
cases and issues presented by litigants according to law. However, it 
may apply equity where the court is unable to arrive at a conclusion or 
judgment strictly on the basis of law due to a gap, silence, obscurity 
or vagueness of the law that the Court can still legitimately remedy, 
and the special circumstances of the case.

 On 17

approved the recommendation of the Expert Group that the Rules should be
 known as "the Nelson Mandela Rules," to honor the legacy of the late 
President of South Africa, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who spent 27 years
 in prison in the course of his struggle for global human rights, 
equality, democracy and the promotion of a culture of peace.

 The 
DOJ has also initiated the same response in the Bureau of Immigration 
(BI) which reported on 14 May 2020 that its 75 personnel and 84 foreign 
detainees in Camp Bagong Diwa have all tested negative for COVID-19. The
 84 out of 400 detainees were tested because they are at greater risk of
 contracting COVID-19. They are either senior citizens or have 
underlying medical conditions. All detainees are required to sanitize. 
The BI detention facility undergoes "rigorous cleaning and continuous 
disinfection." Visits have been temporarily prohibited.

CONCURRING OPINION


 LOPEZ, 
J
.: 


On April 6, 2020, several Persons Deprived of Liberty
[1]
 (PDLs) filed a petition
[2]
 before this Court seeking their provisional freedom for the duration of the Covid-19
[3]
 pandemic through recognizance or bail. The PDLs alleged that they belong to the "
vulnerable or at-risk groups
" because of their medical and/or physical conditions.
[4]
 Also, the PDLs asked for
 ipso facto 
release
 from detention on humanitarian and equitable grounds considering the 
threats of the present public health emergency. Essentially, they prayed
 for the following reliefs:




 1) DIRECTING the temporary RELEASE ON RECOGNIZANCE 
of petitioners, including those similarly situated who are listed herein
 but were not able to subscribe on this Petition due to the lockdown, 
for humanitarian consideration, for the duration of the state of public 
health emergency, national calamity, lockdown and community quarantine 
due to the threats of the COVID 19; 


2) In the alternative, DIRECTING the RELEASE ON BAIL 
of herein petitioners, including those similarly situated who are listed
 and referred to in this Petition, the amounts of which shall be set at 
the discretion of this Honorable Court; 


3) MANDATING the creation of a Prisoner Release 
Committee, similar to those set up in other countries, to urgently study
 and implement the release of all other prisoners in various congested 
prisons throughout the country who are similarly vulnerable but cannot 
be included in this Petition due to the difficult circumstances; and 


4) DECLARING the issuance of ground rules relevant to the release of eligible prisoners.
[5]




 However, it is settled that equity may be availed only in the absence of and never against statutory law or rules of procedure.
[6]
 In our jurisdiction, there are existing positive rules relevant to the rights of PDLs which remain in force.
              




The solemn duty of the Court is to apply the law. It is not a trier of facts.
 






The right to bail is enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.
[7]
 Section 1, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court defined bail as "
the
 security given for the release of a person in custody of the law, 
furnished by him or a bondsman, to guarantee his appearance before any 
court x x x.
" Also, bail is either a matter of right or discretion depending on the penalty, thus:
      
          
 
RULE 114


 x x x x  
              


 
SEC. 4.
 
B
ail, a matter of right; exception.
 â All persons in custody shall be admitted to bail 
as a matter of right
,
 with sufficient sureties, or released on recognizance as prescribed by 
law or this Rule (a) before or after conviction by the Metropolitan 
Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, or 
Municipal Circuit Trial Court, and (b) before conviction by the Regional
 Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment.


 
SEC. 5. 
Bail, when discretionary.
 â Upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment, 
admission to bail is discretionary. 
The
 application for bail may be filed and acted upon by the trial court 
despite the filing of a notice of appeal, provided it has not 
transmitted the original record to the appellate court. However, if the 
decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of
 the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can
 only be filed with and resolved by the appellate court.


 x x x x 


SEC. 7.
 Capital offense or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, not bailable
. â 
No person charged with a capital offense,
 or an offense punishable 
by
 reclusion perpetua

 or life imprisonment, shall be admitted to bail when evidence of guilt 
is strong, regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution. 
(Emphases Supplied)




 In this case, the PDLs failed to indicate whether the 
charges against them are bailable or not. The Solicitor General's 
comment later disclosed that except for one who is serving sentence, all
 the PDLs were charged with non-bailable offenses and their cases are 
pending trial.
[8]
 The PDLs admitted these facts in their reply.
[9]
 It is basic that bail cannot be allowed without a prior hearing to a person charged with an offense punishable with 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment.
[10]

 As such, bail is a matter of discretion and its grant or denial hinges 
on the issue of whether the evidence of guilt against the accused is 
strong. The determination of the requisite evidence can only be reached 
after due hearing. Thus, a judge must first evaluate the prosecution's 
evidence.
[11]
 A hearing is likewise required for the trial court to consider the factors in fixing the amount of bail.
[12]
 Notably, this Court outlined the duties of a judge in resolving bail applications,
[13]
 to wit:
              


 1. In all cases, whether bail is a matter of right 
or of discretion, notify the prosecutor of the hearing of the 
application for bail or require him to submit his recommendation; 


2. Where bail is a matter of discretion, conduct a 
hearing of the application for bail regardless of whether or not the 
prosecution refuses to present evidence to show that the guilt of the 
accused is strong for the purpose of enabling the court to exercise its 
sound discretion; 


3. Decide whether the guilt of the accused is strong based on the summary of evidence of the prosecution; 


4. If the guilt of the accused is not strong, 
discharge the accused upon the approval of the bail bond; otherwise 
petition should be denied.




 Here, the PDLs raised factual issues about their 
health conditions which allegedly made them vulnerable to the pandemic. 
This requires a balancing of interests between the PDLs' presumption of 
innocence and the duty of the State to ensure that they will be ready to
 serve the penalty if eventually found guilty.
[14]
 Yet, what the PDLs submitted are unauthenticated medical certificates which cannot be subject of judicial notice.
[15]

 Likewise, it must be ascertained whether the PDLs are flight risk, or 
capable of committing another crime during their temporary liberty which
 may affect public order and safety. On this point, it must be 
emphasized that this Court is not a trier of facts. Thus, the petition 
should have been filed before the Regional Trial Courts where the PDLs' 
criminal cases are pending. This is consistent with the rule that the 
decision on whether to detain or release an accused before and during 
trial is ultimately an incident of the judicial power to hear and 
determine the criminal case.
[16]






Bail on humanitarian grounds is a matter within the sound discretion of the courts.
 






In
 Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
,
[17]

 this Court allowed bail for humanitarian reasons based on the following
 factors: (1) the principal purpose of bail, which is to guarantee the 
appearance of the accused at the trial or whenever so required by the 
court; (2) the Philippines' responsibility in the international 
community arising from the national commitment under the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
,
 specifically, to uphold the fundamental human rights as well as value 
the worth and dignity of every person; (3) the petitioner's social and 
political standing and his having immediately surrendered to the 
authorities upon his being charged in court indicate that the risk of 
his flight or escape from this jurisdiction is highly unlikely; and (4) 
the fragile state of petitioner's health, as proven by the testimony of a
 physician presents another compelling justification for his admission 
to bail.
              
 The PDLs failed to present similar circumstances. 
The filing of petitions for bail before the trial courts where the 
criminal cases are pending is a remedy that has always been available. 
However, the PDLs opted not to avail of such process insisting that this
 will not provide an adequate and speedy relief to escape the ravaging 
effects of the pandemic. I see no reason for this apprehension. 
Foremost, the trial courts conduct only a summary hearing in bail 
applications.
[18]
 Also, there are ample safeguards under the 
Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases

 against any delay in the proceedings. Specifically, petitions for bail 
shall be set for summary hearing after arraignment and pre-trial and 
shall be resolved by the trial court within a non-extendible period of 
30 calendar days from date of the first hearing, without need of oral 
argument and submission of memoranda.
[19]
 Lastly, the 
Guidelines for Decongesting Holding Jails by Enforcing the Rights of Accused Persons to Bail and to Speedy Trial 
provides that a motion to reduce bail shall enjoy priority in the hearing of cases.
[20]






Worldwide initiatives to release prisoners amid the pandemic are not absolute.
 






It is true that several countries have implemented 
release programs for prisoners to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus 
but these initiatives were subject to exceptions. In Afghanistan, the 
members of Islamist Militant Group are not included. In Indonesia, those
 released were mostly juvenile offenders and those who already served at
 least two-thirds of their sentences. In Iran, only low-risk and 
non-violent offenders serving short sentences are released. In Morocco, 
the prisoners were selected based on their health, age, conduct, and 
length of detention and were granted pardon. In United Kingdom, 
high-risk inmates convicted of violent or sexual offenses, or of 
national security concern or a danger to children were excluded.
[21]
 It must be stressed that the release of prisoners in other jurisdictions was made upon the orders of their Chief Executives.
              
 Corollarily, the matter of unilaterally ordering 
the temporary release of the PDLs solely on equitable grounds is, 
strictly speaking, not purely judicial in character. This Court must 
abstain from exercising such power lest it encroach on the prerogatives 
of the President and the Congress. The separation of powers is a 
fundamental principle in our system of government. It obtains not 
through express provision but by actual division in the framing of our 
Constitution. Each department has exclusive cognizance of matters placed
 within its jurisdiction and is supreme within its own sphere.
[22]

 It is not within the province of the judiciary to express an opinion, 
or express a suggestion, that would reflect on the wisdom or propriety 
of the action of the Chief Executive or the Congress on matters purely 
political in nature. Otherwise, it may be considered as an interference 
or an attempt to influence the exercise of their powers.
[23]

 Hence, the temporary release of PDLs outside of bail, recognizance and 
other court processes is best left to the Chief Executive and Congress, 
especially since matters related to public health and safety are 
political questions.
              




PDLs can avail of adequate protections under international and domestic laws.
 






The overcrowding situation in jail facilities in the 
Philippines increases the risk of contracting any disease. This means 
that regardless of age or whether they have pre-existing medical 
condition, the PDLs are all vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 because 
of the congestion, along with inadequate nutrition and scarcity in 
health care. These are problems that need to be sufficiently addressed, 
not only on account of the pandemic, but more so because these rights 
are ought to be guaranteed to prisoners both under international and 
domestic laws.
              
 On this score, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights

 is customarily binding upon the members of the international community.
 The Philippines has the responsibility of protecting and promoting the 
right of every person to liberty and due process, ensuring that those 
detained or arrested can participate in the proceedings before a court, 
to enable it to decide without delay on the legality of the detention 
and order their release if justified. The Philippine authorities are 
under obligation to make available to every person under detention such 
remedies which safeguard their fundamental right to liberty. These 
remedies include the right to be admitted to bail.
[24]
 Accordingly, this Court extended the application of bail to deportation
[25]
 and extradition
[26]
 proceedings.
              
 Later, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the
 United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners
[27]
 or the 
Nelson Mandela Rules
,
 which seeks to set out what is generally accepted as being good 
principles and practice in the treatment of prisoners and prison 
management.
[28]
 It clothed the PDLs with the following rights:
              
 Rule 24
              


 1. 
The provision of health care for prisoners is a State responsibility.

 Prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are 
available in the community, and should have access to necessary 
health-care services free of charge without discrimination on the 
grounds of their legal status.


 2. Health-care services should be organized in close
 relationship to the general public health administration and in a way 
that ensures continuity of treatment and care, including for HIV, 
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, as well as for drug 
dependence. 


 Rule 25


 1. Every prison shall have in place a health-care 
service tasked with evaluating, promoting, protecting and improving the 
physical and mental health of prisoners, 
paying particular attention to prisoners with special health-care needs
 or with health issues that hamper their rehabilitation.

Prisoners who 
require specialized treatment or surgery shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals

 1. Persons who are found to be not criminally 
responsible, or who are later diagnosed with severe mental disabilities

exacerbation of their condition, shall not be detained in prisons, and 
arrangements shall be made to transfer them to mental health facilities

that national inmates are provided with their basic needs. The 
safekeeping of inmates 
shall moreover comprise decent provision for their basic needs, 
which include habitable quarters, food, water, clothing, and medical care
,
 in compliance with the established UNSMRTP, and consistent with 
restoring the dignity of every inmate and guaranteeing full respect for 
human rights. The complementary component of Safekeeping in custodial 
function is Security which ensures that inmates are completely 
incapacitated from further committing criminal acts, and have been 
totally cut off from their criminal networks (or contacts in the free 
society) while serving sentence inside the premises of the national 
penitentiary. Security also includes protection against illegal 
organized armed groups which have the capacity of launching an attack on
 any prison camp of the national penitentiary to rescue their convicted 
comrade or to forcibly amass firearms issued to corrections officers.

RULE IV
 - 
MANDATES OF THE BUREAU OF CORRECTIONS AND

      TECHNICAL OFFICERS
 


 a) Safekeeping of National Inmates. In compliance 
with established United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment
 of Prisoners (UNSMRTP), the safekeeping of inmates shall include: 


 
1. Decent and adequate provision of basic necessities such as shelters/quarters, food, water, clothing, medicine;
 

      2. Proper observance of prescribed privileges such as regulated communication and visitation; and

      3. Efficient processing of necessary documentary requirements and 
records for their timely release. The processing of these documentary 
requirements shall be undertaken by the Directorate for Inmate Documents
 and Records (DIDR). 


 The core objective of these safekeeping provisions 
is to "accord the dignity of man" to inmates while serving sentence in 
accordance with the basis for humane understanding of Presidential 
Proclamation 551, series 1995, and with UNSMRTP Rule 60. (Emphases 
Supplied) 


 The implementing rules is explicit that PDLs who are
 suffering from contagious diseases should be confined in the hospital 
or infirmary inside the prison compound. Those needing advanced medical 
treatment shall be brought to the nearest hospital if the prison's 
medical facilities are not adequate to treat the disease: 




 
RULE VII 
- 
FACILITIES OF THE BUREAU OF CORRECTIONS




 d) Hospital/Infirmary - refers to a medical facility
 established inside the prison compound for treatment of sick or injured
 inmates. This will also serve as a place of confinement for inmates 
with contagious disease. Sick inmates requiring advance medical 
treatment shall be brought to the nearest hospital if the prison 
hospital does not have the necessary medical equipment and expertise to 
treat such malady. 


 Hospital/Infirmary for Types A and B shall contain, 
at least, basic facilities such as isolation room, emergency room, 
operating room, recovery room, dental, laboratory, X-ray room, comfort 
rooms, beddings, pharmacy and other standard facilities for 
Hospitals/Infirmaries. This shall be in accordance with the 
Administrative Order No. 147-s-2004 issued by the Department of Health. 




 Verily, the trial courts having jurisdiction over the 
criminal cases and bail applications may refer the PDLs to the Bureau of
 Jail Management and Penology (BJMP)'s or BuCor's infirmary for purposes
 of evaluation and treatment. The 2015 BJMP Comprehensive Operations 
Manual likewise provides that, in cases of emergency wherein it would 
not be possible to secure the trial court's order granting Temporary 
Pass, the BJMP is authorized to take an inmate who is seriously ill to 
the nearest hospital. Thereafter, the Jail Warden shall notify the 
regional director and the trial court.
[31]

 All jail personnel must also observe the guidelines in handling inmates
 with special needs such as mentally ill patients, suicidal inmates, 
inmates with disability, children in conflict with the law, senior 
citizen inmates, infirm inmates and pregnant or female inmates with 
infants.
[32]


 
FOR THESE REASONS
, I concur in the result 
that the immediate referral of the petition to the appropriate trial 
courts handling the PDLs' cases is in order.

SEPARATE OPINION




 
DELOS SANTOS, 
J
.: 


The Court is once again called to strike a 
balance between upholding police power and protecting civil libertiesâthis time, in the backdrop of a worldwide adversity.
                
 
Antecedents


 
Background:


 In December of 2019, a new variant of 
coronavirus closely related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
[1]
 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
[2]
 officially known as SARS-CoV-2 suddenly emerged from Wuhan, China.
[3]
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pulmonary disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
                
 COVID-19 spread around the world like wildfire. 
It eventually reached the Philippine soil for the first time on January 
21, 2020 thru a 38-year old female Chinese national who was eventually 
tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.
[4]

 This was followed by a declaration of "public health emergency of 
international concern" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January
 30, 2020 after an emergency committee convened in Geneva, Switzerland.
[5]

 Unfortunately, on March 7, 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) 
reported the first local transmission of COVID-19 in the Philippines.
[6]

 Since the first case of local transmission in the Philippines, 
COVID-19-related infections and deaths have exponentially skyrocketed. 
Panic had spread and the government had to act swiftly to protect the 
people.
                
 
Government Responses:


 On March 8, 2020, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte 
(President Duterte) issued Proclamation No. 922 declaring a State of 
Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines due to COVID-19.
[7]


 On March 16, 2020, President Duterte issued 
Proclamation No. 929 declaring a State of Calamity throughout the 
Philippines due to COVID-19 and imposing the Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (ECQ) effective March 17, 2020 at 12:00 A.M.
[8]

 Immediately thereafter, Executive Secretary Salvador C. Medialdea 
issued a Memorandum by order of President Duterte containing among 
others a directive on all the heads of departments, agencies, offices 
and instrumentalities of the government including the Philippine 
National Police (PNP), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine
 Coast Guard (PCG), all government-owned-and-controlled corporations 
(GOCCs), all government financial institutions (GFIs), all state 
universities and colleges (SUCs) and all local government units (LGUs) 
to commence the implementation of the ECQ and Stringent Social 
Distancing (SSD) Measures.
[9]


 On March 24, 2020, Republic Act No. 11469 (Bayanihan to Heal As One Act) was signed into law.
[10]
 This law granted special powers to President Duterte for the purpose of suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
                
 On April 6, 2020, inmates Dionisio S. Almonte, 
Ireneo O. Atadero, Jr., Alexander Ramonita K. Birondo, Winona Marie O. 
Birondo, Rey Claro Casambre, Ferdinand T. Castillo, Francisco Fernandez,
 Jr., Renante Gamara, Vicente P. Ladlad, Ediesel R. Legaspi, Cleofe 
Lagtapon, Ge-Ann Perez, Adelberto A. Silva, Alberto L. Villamor, 
Virginia B. Villamor, Oscar Belleza, Norberto A. Murillo, Reina Mae A. 
Nasino, Dario Tomada, Emmanuel Bacarra, Oliver B. Rosales and Lilia 
Bucatcat filed directly before this Court a petition denominated as "In 
the Matter of the Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on 
Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic."
                
 
Petition


 The petitioners allege that they are "political 
prisoners and detainees" and are among the elderly, sick and pregnant 
"currently committed in places of detention where it is practically 
impossible to practice self-isolation, social distancing, and other 
COVID
[11]
-19 precautions."
[12]

 As such, they are invoking this Court's power to exercise "equity 
jurisdiction" and are seeking "temporary liberty on humanitarian 
grounds" either on 
recognizance
 
or
 on 
bail
.
[13] 
In seeking their provisional release on recognizance or bail, the petitioners raise the following arguments:
                






(1)


The fatal 
COVID-19 virus causing respiratory failureâwhich emerged from Wuhan, 
China and spread all over the worldâhas no known vaccine and has no 
proven cure.
[14]
 






 


 






(2)


"The 
continued incarceration and detention of highly vulnerable inmates such 
as the elderly, pregnant women, and those who have pre-existing medical 
conditions that pose a high risk of contracting the corona virus is tantamount 
to cruel and unusual punishment, which the 1987 Constitution explicitly 
prohibits."
[15]






 


 


 








(a)


The United 
Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee makes it incumbent upon the State to
 protect and preserve all its prisoners' right to health and medical 
care which are among the guarantees of the right to life.
[16]






 


 


 








(b)


"Prisons and jails are 
incubators and amplifiers of infectious diseases and given the sorry 
state and conditions of jails all over the world, a coronavirus outbreak
 in prison would be awfully and especially destructive "which even" 
prompted UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to call
 for the immediate release of vulnerable prisoners all over the world."
[17]
 






 


 


 








(c)


Other countries 
(specifically US,Canada, Germany, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, England, 
Ireland and Wales, Iran, Sri Lanka and Egypt) had already began 
releasing "hundreds to tens of thousands of prisoners" due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic while the Philippines has yet to respond to the High 
Commissioner's call.
[18]






 


 






(3)


The instant
 case should be resolved "based on compassion and humanitarian 
considerations" in line with this Court's "just, humane and 
compassionate discretion"
[19]
 
"in view of the silence or insufficiency of the law and the rules in 
regard to [the petitioners'] urgent and extraordinary predicament."
[20]






 


 


 








(a)


Rule 114 of the Rules of Court "does not include humanitarian considerations as a ground for the grant of bail"
[21]
 and the guidelines for granting provisional liberty on bail set in 
Cortes v. Judge Catral
[22]

 do not provide any recourse to the said accused who has literally 
nowhere to go to avoid the life-threatening perils of public health 
emergencies like the COVID-19 outbreak."
[23]






 


 


 








(b)


The Court "
may include
 humanitarian considerations as a ground for the grant of bail"
[24]
 "by way of an 
exception

 to procedures on applications for bail or personal recognizance as well
 as the different modes of judicial review under the Rules of Court."
[25]






 


 


 








(c)


This Court has the 
power under Section 1 and Section 5 (5) in relation to Rule 3, Section 1
 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court
[26]

 to "apply equity where the court is unable to arrive at a conclusion or
 judgment strictly on the basis of law due to a gap, silence, obscurity 
or vagueness of the law that the Court can still legitimately remedy, 
and the special circumstances of the case."
[27]






 


 


 








(d)


Certiorari
 is 
not available as a remedy to the petitioners for it is "infeasible" for 
them "to apply for temporary liberty on humanitarian considerations with
 the trial courts" due to the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine 
(ECQ).
[28]
 






 


 


 








(e)


This Court's rulings in 
Reyes v. Lim, et al.
,
[29]
 
Orata v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.
,
[30]
 and 
Daan v. Sandiganbayan
[31]

 which brushed aside some provisions in the Rules of Court by reason of 
equity jurisdiction as well as a US Circuit Court's ruling in US v. 
Jones 
US v. Jones
[32]

 (misspelled by the petitioners as "Joyce") which granted a bail 
application on the ground health perilsâare all applicable to the 
petitioners' circumstances.






 


 


 








(f)


This Court should conform to the rulings of its US counterpart in the 
De Shaney vs. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services
[33]
 and 
Helling vs. McKinney
[34] 
in
 interpreting the latter's Eighth Amendmentâ "a verbatim reproduction of
 Section 19(1) Article III of the Bill of Rights" of the 1987 Philippine
 Constitution on cruel and inhuman punishmentsâ which imposes upon the 
State the obligation to protect the safety and general well-being of 
prisoners and to shield them from unsafe conditions.
[35]






 


 


 








(g)


The BJMP "is not enjoined by law to effect, as a matter of ministerial duty, the release of inmates 
motu proprio
 or without court-issued release orders in the course of a public health emergency."
[36]
 






 


 


 








(h)


The petitioners should 
be released on humanitarian grounds in consonance with their rights 
under International Law which includes the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture, the UN 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners ("Nelson Mandela 
Rules") in relation to the Bureau of Corrections Act (R.A. No. 10575), 
the UN Principles for Older Persons, and all other worldwide calls by UN
 officials as well as the responses of other countries favorable to 
inmates.
[37]
 






 


 


 








(i)


The release on 
humanitarian grounds of the petitioners through recognizance, bail or 
non-custodial measures is just and proper consistent with the Court's 
rulings in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan, et al.
 
[38]
 and 
De La Rama v. People's Court
[39] 
which allowed the grant of bail for humanitarian reasons related to health and advanced age.
[40]






 


 






(4)


The 
government's untimely response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and counter-measure efforts is not enough to guarantee the safety of the
 population including the petitioners and all other inmates. 






 


 


 








(a)


It is not enough that "the government apparently allotted a budget of [P]47,363,816.47 for procurement of medicines, PPEs
[41]

 to protect prisoners all over the country" and the "Bureau of Jail 
Management and Penology (BJMP) has imposed a total lockdown in detention
 facilities nationwide" because the latter "has yet to release any 
information as to whether there are PUMs,
[42]
 PUIs
[43]
 or positive patients in any of the detention facilities."
[44]
 






 


 


 








(b)


There was no adequate, 
coordinated national government response to the COVID-19 situation in 
the first two (2) months of the virus' emergence.
[45]






 


 


 








(c)


The declaration of a 
State of Public Health Emergency did not provide medical solutions or 
health measures especially invulnerable communities such as detention 
facilities.
[46]
 






 


 






(5)


The hellish prison conditions in Philippines makes the petitioners vulnerable to COVID-19 infection
[47]
â making the elderly, sickly and pregnant prisoners to most likely contract the COVID-19 virus due to such conditions.
[48]






 
Comment




 As for the respondents who are represented by the 
Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), they oppose the petitioners' 
pleas and propound the following arguments:
                  






(1)


The 
petitioners are all valuable members of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines â New People's Army â National Democratic Front 
(CPP-NPA-NDF) who are engaging in "a ruse to remove them from the 
confines of judicially-approved custody" which is underhandedly based on
 "merely opportunistic legalism to distort established judicial 
processes" and who are charged with non-bailable offenses as follows:
[49]

Petitioners
 Alexander Ramonita K. Birondo, Winona Marie O. Birondo, Renante M. 
Gamara,Vicente P. Ladlad and Adelberto A. Silva had been granted 
provisional liberty by this Court last August of 2016 in view of their 
participation in the peace talks between the government and the 
CPP-NPA-NDF; but blatantly reneged on their commitment to go back to 
their detention facilities after the failed negotiations which 
necessitated their re-arrest.
[53]






 


 






(3)


The 
petitioners are being deceptive by engaging in "pseudo-political 
correctness in lieu of sound legal arguments" and putting this Court 
"under the lenses" and "[i]n the fickle arena" of public opinion by 
emotionally pleading "humanitarian reasons" which implies that a denial 
of their petition is tantamount to a refusal to act charitably.
[54]






 


 






(4)


The 
petitioners are being deceptive by being silent and by not putting in 
issue on whether or not the State can provide them with medical care 
while maintaining their confinement 
vis-Ã -vis
 the threat of 
COVID-19 as they have not even alleged that there exists better medical 
care for thousands of detainees or that there are medical professionals 
and ventilators available awaiting for them outside their detention 
facilities.
[55]






 


 






(5)


The 
petitioners' "continued detention even affords them ready access to 
government resources if and when the dreaded virus reaches the doors to 
their cells, no less outside their cells."
[56]






 


 






(6)


The government had already adopted the following measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
[57]






 


 


 








(a)


Health protection and safety measures are in place in all penal facilities in the country.
[58]






 


 


 








(b)


The observance of 
safety measures other than social distancing (such as total lockdown, 
restriction of visitation, proper hygienic practices, and/or isolation 
of inmates displaying symptoms of illnesses) is achievable in jails.
[59]






 


 






(7)


The 
petitioners have ample remedies before the lower courts as this Court 
had issued several circulars for purposes of attending to urgent matters 
regarding the legal concerns of persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) as 
part of its efforts to decongest the jails due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[60]






 


 






(8)


The petition should be dismissed outright for violating the doctrine of hierarchy of courts.
[61]
 






 


 


 








(a)


The question posed by 
the petitioners on whether or not they should be released on bail or 
recognizance requires an evaluation of facts.
[62]






 


 


 








(b)


This Court is not a 
trier of facts and it will be overwhelmed with countless petitions which
 might set a precedent by simple invocation of "equity" and the threat 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[63]






 


 


 








(c)


The petitioners' collective acts of attaching documents to prove their medical conditions are factual questions.
[64]






 


 


 








(d)


The grant or denial of 
temporary or provision liberty based on "humanitarian grounds" does not 
diminish the jurisdiction of the trial courts tasked to evaluate the 
veracity of their allegations as well as other factual considerations.
[65]






 


 


 








(e)


The COVID-19 pandemic 
is not a compelling circumstance to oust the lower courts of their 
respective jurisdictions; which is made apparent by the Office of the 
Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 91-2020.
[66]






 


 






(9)


The petitioners cannot be temporarily released on recognizance because all of them were charged of crimes punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 or death and are disqualified to avail of the benefit in R.A. No. 10389
[67]
 (Recognizance Act).
[68]
 






 


 






(10)


The petitioners are not entitled to bail because they were charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 and the determination of whether or not the evidence of guilt is strong shall be made by the trial court thru a proper hearing.
[69]






 


 






(11)


The petitioners cannot be granted temporary liberty based on equity.
[70]






 


 


 








(a)


Equitable arguments cannot prevail over legal findings.
[71]






 


 


 








(b)


Complete and substantial justice is attainable thru governing law (
i.e
. R.A. No. 10389 and Section 7, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court).
[72]






 


 






(12)


The case of 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan
[73]

 is inapplicable in the present situation because the petitioners, as 
shown by their past records, are more likely to escape once released and
 are high-ranking leaders of terrorist groups who have committed heinous
 crimes making their release on "humanitarian grounds" an irony "when 
their acts betray the rationale behind the grant of bail."
[74]






 


 






(13)


The present petition is violative of the equal protection clause.
[75]






 


 


 








(a)


The petitioners are attempting to set themselves apart by making an unwarranted and impermissible classification.
[76]






 


 


 








(b)


"[T]here is no 
substantial difference which sets the petitioners apart from all other 
persons detained in jail" and their release "would give them undue favor
 and would result in inequality and discrimination."
[77]






 


 


 








(c)


"Young and old are equally vulnerable from being inflicted with the disease in absence of precautionary and safety measures."
[78]






 


 


 








(d)


The observance of 
social distancing measures in jails is admittedly impossible or 
unachievable but it does not provide any legal justification to give the
 petitioners an unwarranted favor of being provisionally released while 
other prisoners remain languishing in jail.
[79]






 


 


 








(e)


The petitioners "have 
not shown any evidence proving that they are indeed political prisoners 
and[,] as such, they can be treated differently from among the other 
prisoners in the country."
[80]






 


 






(14)


The release
 of prisoners in other foreign jurisdictions based on humanitarian 
grounds brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic as cited by the 
petitioners are qualified by certain conditions.

government is not expected to conform to the manner of releasing 
prisoners being adopted by other countries" as its "courts are equipped

Discussions


On giving due course to the present petition:


 Petitions filed before this Court are 
essentially divided into two (2) main categories: (a) those that invoke 
appellate jurisdiction; and (b) those that invoke original jurisdiction.
 Those falling within the first category are petitions for review under 
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court where the Court's main function is 
resolving pure questions of law much like the courts of cassation in 
other jurisdictions. Those falling under the second category are 
petitions that either: (a) seek for the issuance of extraordinary or 
prerogative-writs (
certiorari
, prohibition, 
mandamus
, continuing 
mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus, amparo, habeas data
, and 
kalikasan
);
 or (b) seek for the invocation of the Court's inherent powers such as 
those pertaining to the maintenance of orderly proceedings (contempt) or
 those pertaining to administrative disciplinary proceedings against 
members of both the Bench and the Bar. While the procedural requirements
 to be evaluated by this Court in deciding whether or not to give due 
course for petitions under the first category are relatively 
straightforward, the procedural requirements for petitions under the 
second category involving extraordinary 
writs
 are a tad 
complicated. The requirements as well as the corresponding exceptions in
 this specific subcategory of petitions differ depending on the 
writ
 or type of remedy sought.
                  
 As to the procedural requirements for the issuance of extraordinary 
writs
âwhen
 directly invoking this Court's jurisdictionâare concerned, there have 
been several instances where technicalities have been brushed aside in 
order to resolve cases with utmost constitutional significance and 
far-reaching consequences. Accordingly, due to the practical importance 
of keeping the dockets down to a controllable level or load so that only
 petitions with significant import will be entertained, the doctrine of 
hierarchy of courts was devised and developed in order to manage 
petitions falling under the concurrent jurisdiction of the second, third
 and final level courts. Hence, the issuance of extraordinary writs will
 essentially depend on the guidelines laid down in the recent landmark 
case of 
GIOS-SAMAR, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications, et al.
[93]
 which are condensed as follows:
                  






(1)


Despite 
having original and concurrent jurisdiction with the Regional Trial 
Courts and the Court of Appeals (or the Sandiganbayan and the Court of 
Tax Appeals, in some cases) in the issuance of extraordinary writs, a 
direct recourse to this Court seeking for such issuance is proper only 
to seek resolution of questions of law because it is not a trier of 
facts; 






 


 






(2)


The 
hierarchy of courts is a constitutional imperative and a filtering 
mechanism so that this Court may be able: (a) to devote its time and 
resources primarily to cases falling within its exclusive jurisdiction; 
and (b) to ensure the adequate ascertainment of all facts by lower 
courts which are necessarily equipped to perform such function.






 


 






(3)


The 
doctrine of hierarchy of courts proceeds from the constitutional power 
of this Court to promulgate rules "concerning the protection and 
enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice and procedure 
in all courts" for the orderly administration of justice.






 


 






(4)


The 
recognized exceptions to the hierarchy of courts have a common 
denominatorâ the issues for resolution are purely legal. These 
exceptions are:






 


 


 








(a)


when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time; 






 


 


 








(b)


when the issues involved are of transcendental importance;






 


 


 








(c)


cases of first impression; 






 


 


 








(d)


the constitutional issues raised are better decided by the Court;






 


 


 








(e)


exigency in certain situations;






 


 


 








(f)


the filed petition reviews the act of a constitutional organ;






 


 


 








(g)


when petitioners 
rightly claim that they had no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy 
in the ordinary course of law that could free them from the injurious 
effects of respondents' acts in violation of their right to freedom of 
expression; and






 


 


 








(h)


the petition includes 
questions that are "dictated by public welfare and the advancement of 
public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice, or the 
orders complained of were found to be patent nullities, or the appeal 
was considered as clearly an inappropriate remedy."








 Considering the aforementioned guidelines in 
GIOS-SAMAR
,
 the undersigned now proceeds to evaluate the present unsanctioned 
"Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the 
Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic" seeking for the issuance of an 
extraordinary 
writ
: (a) directing the release of the petitioners 
from their detention either on bail or on recognizance; (b) mandating 
the creation of a "Prisoner Release Committee" for the purpose of 
"urgently study[ing] and implement[ing] the release of all other 
prisoners in various congested prisons throughout the country who are 
similarly vulnerable but cannot be included in [their petition] due to 
the difficult circumstances;" and (c) declaring "the issuance of ground 
rules relevant to the release of eligible prisoners."


 Accordingly, the undersigned deems it imperative to clarify that 
litigants
 may only file petitions and other pleadings sanctioned by the 
Constitution, law, or procedural rules promulgated by this Court
. In
 other words, this Court is generally not bound to entertain or to give 
due course to unsanctioned petitions. Nonetheless, the arguments put 
forth in the pleadings of both parties involve: (a) significant and 
far-reaching implications on disputes involving a collision of general 
welfare and individual rights; and (b) unprecedented and pressing 
concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic currently affecting the whole 
nation. Considering the magnitude of the pandemic which affects all 
sectors of society, there is now a pressing need and compelling 
justification to suspend the application of the doctrine of hierarchy of
 courts and to take on its constitutional duty to settle controversies. 
However, such statement should not be interpreted to mean that litigants
 shall have an unbridled freedom to file unsanctioned pleadings directly
 before this Court. Hence, it should be emphasized that the
 rarity

 of the present occurrence (which is the present COVID-19 pandemic) is 
more than enough to indicate to the public that this act of giving due 
course to the present petition shall not be abused as it is primarily 
based on observations regarding compelling matters raised by both 
parties as earlier mentioned.
                  




On the Judicial Enforceability of the Nelson Mandela Rules in the Philippine Jurisdiction:
 






A comprehensive initial discussion as to the effect
 of international law on Philippine laws is imperative in order to 
determine the degree of enforceability of the Nelson Mandela Rules.
                  
 The term "international law" (or "public 
international law" according to other recognized authorities) generally 
refers to a body of rules which govern the relationship
[94]

 of states and international organizations which, in some instances like
 human rights concerns, include the treatment of natural persons.
[95]
 It is founded largely upon the principles of reciprocity, comity, independence, and equality of states.
[96]
 The sources of this "body of rules" are provided by Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice
[97]
 as follows:
                  
 Article 38
                  






1.


The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:






 


 


 








a.


international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states; 






 


 


 








b.


international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; 






 


 


 








c.


the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;






 


 


 








d.


subject to the 
provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the 
most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary 
means for the determination of rules of law.






 


 






2.


This provision shall not prejudice the power of the Court to decide a case 
ex aequo et bono
, if the parties agree thereto.








The aforementioned sources of international law 
have been traditionally categorized into peremptory and non-peremptory 
norms. On one hand, 
peremptory norms
 or 
jus cogens
 refers to those mandatory and non-derogable norms or principles which give rise to 
erga omnes
 obligations (even if no consensus exists on their substance
[98]
) and which are modifiable only by general international norms of equivalent authority.
[99]
 On the other hand, 
non-peremptory norms
, are those international principles or rules which do not have compelling or binding effect against a state.


 Concomitantly, the 1987 Philippine Constitution 
contains some provisions alluding to the practice of considering 
international norms and principles as part of domestic laws. However, it
 is settled that the Constitution is the basic and paramount law to 
which all other laws must conform and to which all persons, including 
the highest officials of the land, must defer.
[100]

 This long-standing doctrinal pronouncement, in relation to 
international law, is consistent with Articles 1 (2) and 55 of the UN 
Charter
[101]
 which espouses "the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples."
[102]

 From a Philippine legal standpoint, international norms which are 
considered forming part of domestic laws must still yield to the 
supremacy of the Constitution.
[103]

 Consequently, both peremptory and non-peremptory norms may become part 
of the sphere of domestic law as provided under the present Constitution
 either by: (a) 
transformation
âa method which requires an international law or principle to be converted to domestic law thru a constitutional 
mechanism
 such as enactment of an enabling legislation or ratification of a treaty; and (b) 
incorporation
âa method where an international law or principle is deemed to have the force of domestic law thru a constitutional
 declaration
.
[104]

 Of these methods, it is understood that international norms are either 
transformed or incorporated into domestic laws depending on which 
category they belong.
                  
 Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
[105] 
(Vienna Convention) states that "a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm 
accepted
 and 
recognized
 by the international community of States

 as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which 
can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law 
having the same character." Since Section 2, Article II of the 
Constitution expressly states that the Philippines "adopts the 
generally accepted
 principles of international law as part of the law of the land," it is beyond question that only norms which have attained a 
peremptory
 status by general acceptance or recognition by the community of states can be considered as part of the law of the land by 
incorporation
. Resultantly, all other norms 
not
 contemplated
 or 
covered
 in the 
definition
 of 
"peremptory norm"
 in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention have to undergo the method of 
transformation

 in order to have a binding effect as other domestic laws. Furthermore, 
transformation may be undertaken either of the following methods: (a) 
thru ratification of a treaty under Section 21,
[106]
 Article VII of the Constitution; or (b) thru enactment of an enabling law adopting a non-peremptory norm of international law.
                  
 As to the characterization of the Nelson 
Mandela Rules, the undersigned reproduces Articles 10 to 14, Chapter IV 
of the United Nations (UN) Charter as follows:
                  
 
Article 10




 The General Assembly 
may discuss
 any 
questions or any matters within the scope of the present Charter or 
relating to the powers and functions of any organs provided for in the 
present Charter, and, except as provided in Article 12, 
may make recommendations
 to the Members of the United Nations or to the Security Council or to both on any such questions or matters.




 
Article 11








1.


The General Assembly 
may consider

 the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of 
international peace and security, including the principles governing 
disarmament and the regulation of armaments, and 
may make recommendations
 with regard to such principles to the Members or to the Security Council or to both. 






 


 






2.


The General Assembly 
may discuss

 any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and 
security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations, or by 
the Security Council, or by a state which is not a Member of the United 
Nations in accordance with Article 35, paragraph 2, and, except as 
provided in Article 12, 
may make recommendations
 with regard to 
any such questions to the state or states concerned or to the Security 
Council or to both. Any such question on which action is necessary 
shall be referred
 to the Security Council by the General Assembly either before or after discussion.






 


 






3.


The General Assembly 
may call the attention
 of the Security Council to situations which are likely to endanger international peace and security.






 


 






4.


The powers of the General Assembly set forth in this Article shall not limit the general scope of Article 10.






 






Article 12






 


 






1.


While the 
Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation 
the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General 
Assembly 
shall not make any recommendation
 with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.






 


 






2.


The 
Secretary-General, with the consent of the Security Council, shall 
notify the General Assembly at each session of any matters relative to 
the maintenance of international peace and security which are being 
dealt with by the Security Council and shall similarly notify the 
General Assembly, or the Members of the United Nations if the General 
Assembly is not in session, immediately the Security Council ceases to 
deal with such matters.






 






Article 13






 


 






1.


The General Assembly 
shall initiate studies
 and 
make recommendations
 for the purpose of:






 


 


 








a.


promoting 
international co-operation in the political field and encouraging the 
progressive development of international law and its codification;






 


 


 








b.


promoting international
 co-operation in the economic, social, cultural, educational, and health
 fields, and assisting in the realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, 
language, or religion.






 


 






2.


The further
 responsibilities, functions and powers of the General Assembly with 
respect to matters mentioned in paragraph 1 (b) above are set forth in 
Chapters IX and X.






 






Article 14






 






Subject to the provisions of Article 12, the General Assembly 
may recommend measures

 for the peaceful adjustment of any situation, regardless of origin, 
which it deems likely to impair the general welfare or friendly 
relations among nations, including situations resulting from a violation
 of the provisions of the present Charter setting forth the Purposes and
 Principles of the United Nations. (Underscoring supplied)








The aforementioned provisions clearly show that the UN Charter merely grants 
recommendatory
 powers to the UN General Assembly (composed of all member states 
per

 Article 9 of the same Charter) in terms of policy-making. As observed 
by Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen (Justice Leonen), UN 
General Assembly Resolutions such as the Nelson Mandela Rules may 
constitute "soft law" or 
non-binding
 norms, principles and practices that influence state behavior.
[107]

 Consequently, any resolution issued by the UN General Assembly does not
 carry with it the status of being a peremptory norm. Simply put, it has
 no binding effect on UN member states. Since the Nelson Mandela Rules 
gained an official international status 
thru the UN General Assembly's adoption of a Resolution on December 17, 2015
,
 it stands to reason that the same Rules cannot be considered as a 
binding peremptory norm of international law for being merely 
recommendatory. A 
contrary rule of interpretation
 which will make
 every resolution of the UN General Assembly, like the Nelson Mandela 
Rules, automatically binding and part of the law of the land 
would undermine and unduly restrict the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines
.
 It stifles the Republic's prerogative to interpret international laws 
thru the lenses of its own legal system or tradition. Therefore, 
the 
Nelson Mandela Rules needs to be transformed into a domestic law thru an
 enabling act of Congress in a clear and unequivocal manner
 to have a legally binding force.


 In response to the UN General Assembly's adoption of the Nelson Mandela Rules, R.A. No. 10575
[108]

 (Bureau of Corrections Act) was enacted by Congress. It made an implied
 reference to the Nelson Mandela Rules by providing as follows:
                  


 Section 4. The Mandates of the Bureau of 
Corrections. - The [Bureau of Corrections] shall be in charge of 
safekeeping and instituting reformation programs to national inmates 
sentenced to more than three (3) years.








(a)


Safekeeping of National Inmates â 
The safekeeping of inmates shall include decent provision of quarters, food, water and clothing 
in compliance with
 established United Nations standards
. The
 security of the inmates shall be undertaken by the Custodial Force 
consisting of Corrections Officers with a ranking system and salary 
grades similar to its counterpart in the BJMP. 






 


 






(b)


Reformation of National Inmates â The 
reformation programs
, which will be instituted by the [Bureau of Corrections] 
for the inmates
, shall be the following:






 


 


 








(1)


Moral and Spiritual Program;






 


 


 








(2)


Education and Training Program;






 


 


 








(3)


Work and Livelihood Program;






 


 


 








(4)


Sports and Recreation Program;






 


 


 








(5)


Health and Welfare Program
; and






 


 


 








(6)


Behavior Modification Program, to include Therapeutic Community.






 


 






(c)


The 
reformation programs shall be undertaken by Professional Reformation 
Personnel consisting of Corrections Technical Officers with ranking 
system and salary grades similar to Corrections Officers.






 


 


 








(1)


Corrections Technical
 Officers are personnel employed in the implementation of reformation 
programs and those personnel whose nature of work requires proximate or 
direct contact with inmates. 






 


 


 








(2)


Corrections Technical
 Officers include priests, evangelists, pastors, teachers, instructors, 
professors, vocational placement officers, librarians, guidance 
counselors, 
physicians, nurses, medical technologists, pharmacists, dentists, therapists,
 psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, 
social workers
,
 engineers, electricians, agriculturists, veterinarians, lawyers and 
similar professional skills relevant to the implementation of inmate 
reformation programs. (Emphasis supplied)










At this juncture, there now arises a need to determine whether this Court or the entire Judicial branch is 
constitutionally-empowered
 to 
issue writs or other orders
 to 
compel
 the Bureau of Corrections and all the other public respondents to
 implement 
Section 4 of the Bureau of Corrections Act in some 
particular manner
.


 The answer strongly points to the negative for the following reasons:
                  
 
First
, the general import of the
 terms in Section 4 (a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act in relation to 
the Nelson Mandela Rules clearly shows that such provision (Section 4) 
is not judicially-enforceable.
                  
 In constitutional interpretation, it is 
settled that a provision is self-executing if the nature and extent of 
the right conferred and the liability imposed are fixed by the 
Constitution itself, so that they can be determined by an examination 
and construction of its terms, and there is no language indicating that 
the subject is referred to the legislature for action.
[109]

 The same can be said of statutory interpretation if the law itself 
clearly defines a right in terms of its nature and extent as well as the
 liability or duty imposed pursuant to such right. In effect, statutory 
provisions which are not self-executing do not confer rights which can 
be judicially enforcedâthey only provide guidelines for executive 
action.
[110]


 The phrase "in compliance with established United Nations standards" in Section 4 (a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act is 
so generic
 that it clearly appears to be 
silent regarding the manner of its implementation
.
 A thorough reading of the law will reveal that Section 23 of the same 
law merely delegates the task of jointly promulgating the necessary 
implementing rules and regulations to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in
 coordination with the Bureau of Corrections, the Civil Service 
Commission (CSC), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and the
 Department of Finance (DOF)."
[111]
 The law is also silent as to the degree (moderate or strict).
                  
 For purposes of demonstration, the undersigned
 reproduces some provisions in the Nelson Mandela Rules pertaining to 
the accommodation of prisoners as follows:
                  


 
Rule 5


x x x 






2.


Prison administrations shall make all 
reasonable accommodation and adjustments
 to ensure that prisoners with physical, mental or other disabilities have 
full and effective access to prison life on an equitable basis
.






x x x 


Rule 13


 All accommodation provided for the use of prisoners and in particular all sleeping accommodation 
shall meet all requirements of health
, due regard being paid to climatic conditions and particularly to 
cubic content of air, minimum floor space, lighting, heating and ventilation
.




 x x x 
                  
Rule 28




 In women's prisons, there shall be 
special accommodation
 for all necessary prenatal and postnatal care and treatment. 
Arrangements shall be made

 wherever practicable for children to be born in a hospital outside the 
prison. If a child is born in prison, this fact shall not be mentioned 
in the birth certificate. (Underscoring supplied)




 As to the issue of specific implementation, the 
following phrases of the afore-cited Nelson Mandela Rules stand out: (a)
 "reasonable accommodation and adjustments;" (b) "full and effective 
access to prison life on an equitable basis;" (c) "shall meet all 
requirements of health;" (d) "cubic content of air, minimum floor space,
 lighting, heating and ventilation;" (e) "special accommodation;" and 
(f) "[a]rrangements shall be made." All of these phrases do not provide 
specific details as to the manner of implementation. They all appear to 
constitute or operate as primary guidelines for the proper handling of 
inmates in terms of accommodation. For instance, the words "reasonable,"
 "access," "special," and "arrangements" are so vague that the 
ministerial duty of an executive or administrative agency cannot be 
pinpointed in terms of the effectivity of a mandatory injunctive 
writ
. Bluntly speaking, how will the Bureau of Corrections determine what is "special" or what is "reasonable" in executing a 
writ
? 
A
 court cannot simply define these terms and invent parameters akin to 
administrative issuances resembling subordinate legislation.
 Other 
details lacking in the general import of the Nelson Mandela Rules are 
the dimensions associated with "cubic content of air, minimum floor 
space, lighting, heating and ventilation." The dimensions regarding the 
living quarters and amenities provided in Implementing Rules and 
Regulations
[112]
 (IRR) of the 
Bureau of Corrections Act cannot possibly be altered by virtue of a 
court order without violating the principle of separation of powers. As 
pointed out earlier, Section 23 of the Bureau of Corrections Act places 
the task of promulgating the IRR on the DOJ (in coordination with the 
Bureau of Corrections), the CSC, the DBM and the DOF. There is nothing 
in the same Section which permits the courts to adjust these rules based
 on "equitable" considerations. Under the circumstances contemplated in 
the aforementioned provisions in the Nelson Mandela Rules, only the 
Executive department can reasonably determine the parameters of its 
compliance. Besides, the Judiciary's interference with the Executive 
department in the enforcement of a plain provision of the statute would,
 in effect, destroy the independence of the latter department and 
subject it under the former's ultimate control.
[113]


 As keenly observed by Chief Justice Diosdado 
M. Peralta (Chief Justice Peralta), the Nelson Mandela Rules espouse the
 generally vicarious idea that it is the responsibility of every state 
to make accommodations in prisons well suited for proper hygiene, 
nutrition and hydration, especially to prisoners with particular health 
care needs. These rules, instead, highlight the obligation of 
transferring prisoners, whether convicts or detainees, with urgent 
medical conditions to specialized institutions and in specialized 
facilities where they can have prompt access to medical attention. The 
main premises for the application of international law principles are 
lacking in the case of the petitioners, especially in the absence of an 
emerging and/or immediate need to receive specialized medical attention 
which the prison facilities cannot cater to and address at the moment.
                  
 
Second
, the implementation of the Bureau of Corrections Act is dependent on the available funds of the Bureau.
                  
 Section 22 of the same law provides:
                  


 Section 22. Implementation. - The
 implementation 
of this Act shall be undertaken in staggered phases, but not to exceed five (5) years, 
taking into consideration the 
financial position
 of the 
national government
: Provided, That any partial implementation shall be uniform and proportionate for all ranks. (Emphasis supplied)




 Yearly financial positions of the national 
government are mostly dependent on factors beyond its control. For 
instance, revenues thru tax and regulatory fee collections cannot be 
reasonably predicted. Various factorsâsuch as the number of taxpayers, 
the net taxable income of taxpayers, the volume of activities involving 
excise and value-added taxes, the number of applicants of any sanctioned
 permit or franchiseâall fluctuates depending on results on the dynamics
 of the nation's collective economic activities. This translates to 
uncertain internal revenue streams which accounts for almost all of the 
sources of the nation's resources available for budget. To add to the 
Bureau of Corrections' financial woes, the national government has also 
to contend with budgetary concerns coming from other sectors (or 
problems) of society which, frankly, are within the absolute prerogative
 of Congress to prioritize; sadly, even over the needs of correctional 
facilities. Unsurprisingly, this is beyond the control of the Bureau of 
Corrections and, sometimes, even beyond the control of Congress if it 
has to respond to exigencies.
                  
 Another factor is the unpredictability of the 
influx of inmates in correctional or detention facilities. Even with the
 most sophisticated data-gathering methods and analytical tools assisted
 by the current capabilities of modern technology, both the Executive 
and the Legislative cannot reasonably estimate or anticipate how many 
persons will commit crimes in a stated interval of time. In order to 
demonstrate this problem, the undersigned reproduces Section 12 of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules as follows:
                  
 
Rule 12








1.


Where sleeping accommodation is in 
individual cells or rooms, each prisoner shall occupy
 by night a cell or room by 
himself or herself
. If for special reasons, such as 
temporary overcrowding
, it becomes necessary for the central prison administration to make an exception to this rule, 
it is not desirable to have two prisoners in a cell or room
. 






 


 






2.


Where dormitories are used, they shall be occupied by prisoners 
carefully selected as being suitable to associate with one another in those conditions
. There shall be regular supervision by night, in keeping with the nature of the prison. (Underscoring, supplied)








A 
realistic
 assessment
 of the 
Philippine correctional system will show that the national government's 
financial position cannot possibly cope up with the standards of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules which even contemplates prisoners detained in 
"individual cells or rooms" for "each prisoner" to occupy "by himself or
 herself." To add to the Bureau of Corrections' burdens, the first 
paragraph of the afore-cited rule even goes as far as to imply that 
"temporary overcrowding" is or should be the norm in correctional 
facilities. For some countries with seemingly unlimited resources and 
relatively low crime rates, compliance is considerably possible. 
However, for the Philippines which has been reportedly afflicted with 
persisting issues of overcrowding, the instance of "temporary 
overcrowding" is colloquially "
pangarap ng gising
" (the stuff of 
dreams). Admittedly, the Bureau of Corrections has limited land area or 
real estate. Any adaptive measure as to the influx of inmates will have 
to be "vertical"âcorrectional buildings will have to be remodelled in 
order to add more stories or floors to house more cells. Any budget 
allotted by the national government to the Bureau of Corrections will 
have to be stretched to meet such accommodational needs.


 As regards the provisions of the IRR on 
accommodation and facilities (which appears to provide details in 
relation to the Nelson Mandela Rules), the implementation of a mandatory
 injunctive
 writ
 will be inherently limited by the availability of funds. 
First
, the provisions in the IRR containing matters relating to the standards under the Nelson Mandela Rules (
i.e
. ventilation, floor area, lighting, 
etc.
) all 
require funds 
to be realized. 
Second
, the IRR is a subordinate legislationâit 
merely implements

 the provisions in the Bureau of Corrections Act with the aid of 
congressionally-provided funds. Stated differently, the IRR is: (a) not a
 source of substantive rights and substantive obligations which, under 
the Constitution, are properly created or recognized by substantive 
laws; and (b) dependent upon available funds as appropriated by 
Congress. Hence, in terms of accommodation, any judicial relief asserting
 to enjoin some form of compliance with the provisions of the IRR will 
merely amount to a "paper relief" when funds are inadequate to execute a
 
writ
.
                  
 To be clear, the undersigned is 
not
 
saying that, just because the Executive branch is currently limited in 
its resources to comply with the mandate in Section 4 of the Bureau of 
Corrections Act, any solution to address the poor and substandard state 
of existing correctional and other detention facilities is, and will 
remain to be impossible to achieve. It is not impossible for the 
government to improve its financial status and adequately provide for 
the sectors that currently lack the needed funding. All that the 
undersigned is saying is that the proper branches of government 
constitutionally-empowered to raise the needed funding and to remedy the
 situation regarding the accommodation and sanitation problems affecting
 correctional and other detention facilities are the political 
branchesâthe Legislative and the Executiveânot the Judiciary. In sum, 
the very reason for denying the instant petition is to avoid violating 
the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitutionânot because this 
Court is or should be insensitive to the plight of the petitioners.
                  
 
Third
, the respondents' present 
inability

 to comply with the Nelson Mandela Rules or Section 4 of the Bureau of 
Corrections Act regarding the accommodation of all prisoners cannot be 
considered as a ground to release the petitioners pursuant to the 
constitutional prohibition against cruel, degrading or inhuman 
punishment.
                  
 To begin with, the petitioners' (except for 
Lilia Bucatcat who is presently serving her sentence) previous arrest 
and present temporary detention are not considered as penalties or 
punishments as contemplated in Article 24 (1) of the Revised Penal Code 
because the service of a sentence of one in prison begins only on the 
day the judgment of conviction becomes final.
[114]
 However, since Article 29
[115]

 of the Revised Penal code provides that convicted "[o]ffenders or 
accused who have undergone preventive imprisonment shall be credited in 
the service of their sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty, with
 the full time during which they have undergone preventive 
imprisonment,"
[116]
 the undersigned deems it necessary to elucidate further on the matter of cruel, degrading and inhuman punishments.
                  
 The prohibition against the infliction of cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment in Section 19,
[117]
 Article III of the present Constitution was derived from the Eighth Amendment
[118]

 of the US Constitution which likewise proscribes the infliction of 
"cruel and unusual" punishments. However, what constitutes cruel and 
unusual punishment has not been exactly defined.
[119]
 Instead, the Court in 
Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice, et al.
[120]
 provides several insights on what cruel, degrading and inhuman punishment includes, 
viz
: (a) "death penalty 
per se

 is not a cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment;" (b) "[p]unishments 
are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death" as they 
"impl[y] [that] there something inhuman and barbarous, something more 
than the mere extinguishment of life;" (c) "[i]n a limited sense, 
anything is cruel which is calculated to give pain or distress, and 
since punishment imports pain or suffering to the convict;" (d) the 
cruelty proscribed by the Constitution is that which is "inherent in the
 method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any 
method employed to extinguish life humanely;" (e) what is cruel and 
unusual ""is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as 
public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice" and "must draw 
its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the 
progress of a maturing society;" and (f) "the primary indicator of 
society's standard of decency with regard to capital punishment is the 
response of the country's legislatures to the sanction."
                  
 In relation to deprivation of liberty, whether
 imposed as a punishment or preventive measure, the Court should turn to
 the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission (Constitutional
 Commission) for guidance regarding the accommodation of inmates, the 
portions of which are hereunder reproduced as follows:
                  






MR. NATIVIDAD:


May I go on
 to Section 22 which says: "Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor 
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment, or the death penalty inflicted."
 I will not deal with the death penalty because it has already been 
belabored in many remarks. In due time, perhaps I will be given a chance
 to say a few words on that, too. But I am referring to cruel, degrading
 and inhuman punishment. I am drawing upon my experience as the Chairman
 of the National Police Commission for many years. As Chairman of the 
National Police Commission, the same way that General de Castro here 
was, one of my duties was to effect the inspection of jails all over the
 country. We must admit that our jails are a shame to our race. Once we 
were invited by the United Nations' expert on penology â I do not 
remember his name, but he is a doctor friend of mine â and he reported 
back to us that our jails are penological monstrosities.






 


 








Here in the cities, 85 
percent are detention prisoners and only 15 percent are convicted 
prisoners. But if we visit the jails, they are so crowded and the 
conditions are so subhuman that one-half of the inmates lie down on the 
cold cement floor which is usually wet, even in summer. One-half of them
 sleep while the other half sit up to wait, until the other half wake 
up, so that they can also sleep. In the toilets, right beside the bowl, 
there are people sleeping. I visited the prisons and that was the time I
 fought for the Adult Probation Law because I remember what Winston 
Churchill and the criminologist Dostoevski said: "If you want to know 
the level of civilization of a country, all you have to do is visit 
their jails." In jurisprudence, the interpretation of "cruel and unusual
 punishment" in the United States Constitution was made by the Supreme 
Court when it said, and I quote: "Interpretation of the Eight[h] 
Amendment in the phrase 'cruel and unusual punishment,' must draw its 
meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of
 a maturing society." Courts in the United States in 10 landmark cases â
 some of these I would like to mention in passing: Halt v. Sarver, 
Jackson v. Bishop, Jackson v. Handrick, Jordan v. Fitzharris and Roddy 
v. Stanley â stated that 
sub-human conditions in a prison is an unconstitutional imposition of cruel and unusual punishment
.






 


 








I would just like to â 
even without an amendment â convince the Committee that if a prison is 
subhuman and it practices beatings and extended isolation of prisoners, 
and has sleeping cells which are extremely filthy and unsanitary, these 
conditions should be included in the concept of "cruel and inhuman 
punishment." Even without amendment but with this concept, 
I would 
like to encourage the legislature to give higher priority to the 
upliftment of our jails and for the judiciary to act because the 
judiciary in habeas corpus proceedings freed some prisoners
. So, by 
means of injunction, the courts stopped these practices which are 
inimical to the constitutional rights of inmates. On the part of the 
executive, it initiated reforms in order that the jails can be more 
humane and fair. If this concept of "cruel and inhuman punishment" can 
be accepted, Mr. Presiding Officer, I may not even ask for an amendment 
so that in the future, 
the judiciary, the executive and the 
legislative can give more remedial measures to this festering problem of
 subhuman conditions in our jails and prisons
.






 


 








I submit, Mr. Presiding Officer.






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


Mr. Presiding Officer, 
although I would say that the description of the situation is something 
that is inhuman, I wonder if it fits into the purpose of Section 22. The
 
purpose 
of Section 22 is to 
provide a norm
 for 
invalidating a penalty
 that is imposed by law
.
 Let us say that thieves should be punished by imprisonment in a filthy 
prison, that would be "cruel and unusual punishment." But if the law 
simply say that thieves should be punished by imprisonment, that by 
itself does not say that it is cruel. So, it does not invalidate the 
penal law. So my own thinking is that what the Gentleman has in mind 
would be something more proper; even for ordinary legislation or, if at 
all, for Section 21.






 


 






MR. NATIVIDAD:


The Gentleman said that
 he is not going to sentence him in a filthy prison. Of course not. But 
this is brought out in the petition for
 habeas corpus 
or for injunction. This is revealed in a proper petition. 






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


I agree with the Commissioner, but as I said, 
the 
purpose 
of Section 22 is to 
invalidate
 the law itself
 which imposes a penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman
. That is the purpose of this law. The Commissioner's purpose is different.






 


 






MR. NATIVIDAD:


My purpose is to abate 
the inhuman treatment, and thus give spirit and meaning to the banning 
of cruel and inhuman punishment. In the United States, if the prison is 
declared unconstitutional, 
and what is enforced is an unconstitutional punishment
,
 the courts, because of that interpretation of what is cruel and 
inhuman, may impose conditions to improve the prison; free the prisoners
 from jail; transfer all prisoners; close the prison; or may refuse to 
send prisoners to the jail.






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


We would await the formulation of the Commissioner's amendment. 






 


 






MR. NATIVIDAD:


So, in effect, it is 
abating the continuance of the imposition of a cruel and inhuman 
punishment. I believe we have to start somewhere in giving hope to a big
 segment of our population who are helplessly caught in a trap. Even the
 detention prisoners, 85 percent of whom are jailed in the metropolitan 
area, are not convicted prisoners, and yet although not convicted in 
court, they are being made to suffer this cruel and inhuman punishment. I
 am saying this in their behalf, because as Chairman of the National 
Police Commission for so many years, it was my duty to send my 
investigators to chronicle the conditions in these jails day by day. I 
wrote letters to the President asking for his help, as well as to the 
Batasan, but there was no reply.






 


 








Finally, I am now here 
in this Commission, and I am writing this letter through the Chairman of
 this Committee. I hope it will be answered. (Emphases supplied)








As shown in the aforementioned exchanges, 
Commissioner Teodulo C. Natividad (Commissioner Natividad) initially 
proposed that the prohibition on cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment 
be made to cover subhuman accommodations of inmates in correctional and 
other detention facilities. Contrastingly, Commissioner Joaquin G. 
Bernas (Commissioner Bernas) opposed Commissioner Natividad's proposal 
by enunciating that 
the 
purpose 
of such 
prohibition
 is "to provide a 
norm
 for
 invalidating
 a 
penalty
 that is 
imposed
 by law" or "to 
invalidate
 the 
law 
itself
 which imposes a penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman"â not to recognize a substantive right
.
 However, Commissioner Natividad's proposal gained traction as 
Commissioner Regalado E. Maambong (Commissioner Maambong) supported the 
idea that the prohibition on cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment be 
made to encompass subhuman jail conditions as follows:








MR. MAAMBONG:


Mr. 
Presiding Officer, the clarification being sought or the amendment which
 may be proposed, if it becomes necessary, reflects the concern of 
Commissioners Natividad, Ople, de los Reyes and myself, regarding our 
Proposed Resolution No. 482 which gives meaning and substance to the 
constitutional provision against cruel or unusual punishment. I do not 
wish to be expansive about it. I will try to stick to my time limit, but
 I find this rather emotional on my part because, as a practicing 
lawyer, I have been going in and out of jails. As a lawyer, of course, I
 would like to call the attention of the Committee to certain things 
which they already know, that it has been established by courts of 
modern nations that the concept of cruel or unusual punishment is not 
limited to instances in which a particular inmate or pretrial prisoner 
is subjected to a punishment directed to him as an individual, such as 
corporal punishment or torture, confinement in isolation or in large 
numbers, in open barracks or uncompensated labor, among other forms. 
Confinement
 itself within a given institution may amount to cruel or unusual 
punishment prohibited by the Constitution where the confinement is 
characterized by conditions and practices that are so bad as to be 
shocking to the conscience of reasonably civilized people
. It must 
be understood that the life, safety and health of human beings, to say 
nothing of their dignity, are at stake. Although inmates are not 
entitled to a country club existence, they should be treated in a fair 
manner. Certainly, they do not deserve degrading surroundings and unsanitary
 conditions. (Emphasis supplied)








This led to the following exchange of concerns between Commissioners Maambong and Bernas, as follows:








MR. MAAMBONG:


Just one sentence, Mr. Presiding Officer, so that my train of thought will not be destroyed, if I may.






 


 








Unless facilities of 
the penitentiary are brought up to a level of constitutional 
tolerability, they should not be used for the confinement of prisoners 
at all. 
Courts in other jurisdictions have ordered the closure of 
sub-standard and outmoded penal institutions. All these require judicial
 orders in the absence of implementing laws to provide direct measures 
to correct violations of human rights or institute alterations in the 
operations and facilities of penal institutions
. I may not have to 
present any amendment but I will ask some clarifications from the 
Committee. For example, in the case of the words "cruel, degrading or 
inhuman punishment," my question is: Does this cover convicted inmates 
and pretrial detainees? That is the first question.






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


This is a matter which I
 discussed with Commissioner Natividad. I think the Gentleman has 
similar ideas on this. I tried to explain to him that the problem he 
envisions is different from the problem being treated here. In Section 
22, we are talking of a proposed, if it becomes necessary, reflects the 
concern punishment that is contained in a statute which, 
if as described in the statute is considered to be degrading or inhuman punishment, invalidates the statute 
itself
. But the problem that was discussed with me by Commissioner Natividad is the situation 
where
 a person is convicted under a valid statute or is accused under a valid
 statute and, therefore, detained but is confined under degrading and 
inhuman circumstances. I suggested to him that that will be treated not 
together with this, because this section has a different purpose, but as
 a different provision as a remedy for individuals who are detained 
legally but are being treated in an inhuman way
.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Are we saying that when
 a person is convicted under a valid statute and he is inside the jail 
because of the conviction out of that valid statute when he is treated 
in an inhuman and degrading manner, we have no remedy at all under 
Section 22?






 


 








My understanding is that 
this is not the protection he can appeal
 to. That is why I was asking Commissioner Natividad that 
if he wants a protection for that, to 
please formulate something else
.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


All right, then.






 


 








The second question would be: 
The
 words "cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment" do not cover the 
situation that we contemplate of substandard or outmoded penal 
facilities and degrading and unsanitary conditions inside the jail
[?]






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


Yes,
 we are referring to cruel, degrading or inhuman punishments 
which are prescribed in the statute 
itself
. 
We cannot conceive a situation that the statute would prescribe that
.
 The problem that the Gentleman contemplates again, I think, is about a 
person who is held under a valid statute but is treated cruelly and 
inhumanly in a degrading manner. So, we ask for a different remedy for 
him. (Emphases supplied)








The aforementioned discussions show that Commissioner Bernas 
emphasized the need for creating a separate provision

 in order to address the observation that it is inconceivable for 
Congress to enact a statute prescribing on its face for a cruel, 
degrading or inhuman punishment. After a stimulating exchange of ideas, 
the framers eventually arrived at a compromise as shown by the following
 discussions:








THE PRESIDENT: 


Is there any objection? (Silence) The Chair hears none; the motion is approved.






 


 






 


The body will continue the consideration of Section 22 of the Bill of Rights which reads:






 


 






 


The employment of corporal or psychological 
punishment against prisoners or pretrial detainees, or the use of 
substandard or outmoded penal facilities characterized by degrading 
surroundings, unsanitary or subhuman conditions should be dealt with in 
accordance with law.






 


 






 


Commissioner Maambong is recognized. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


Madam President, I just would like to 
indicate the generous response of the Members of the Commission to this 
proposed amendment, notably Commissioners Romulo, Suarez, Davide, Rigos 
and others who offered beautiful suggestions to implement the concept.






 


 






 


I will start, however, with the perfecting 
modifications offered by the Committee, acting through the efforts of 
Commissioner Nolledo to whom the proponents are very grateful.






 


 






 


Based on the draft, copies of which are now 
in the possession of the Members, on line 2, between the words "against"
 and "prisoners," insert the word CONVICTED.






 


 






 


On line 3, delete the words "substandard or outmoded" and substitute the word INADEQUATE.






 


 






 


On the same line 3, delete the last word "characterized," together with all the words on line 4, and substitute the word UNDER.






 


 






 


On lines 5 and 6, delete the words "in accordance with law" and substitute the words BY LAW. So with this [
sic
]
 Committee modifications, the whole proposed amendment would read: "The 
employment of corporal or psychological punishment against CONVICTED 
prisoners or pretrial detainees, or the use of INADEQUATE penal 
facilities UNDER subhuman conditions should be dealt with BY LAW."






 


 






 


We now present that before the Committee, Madam President. 






 


 






MR. SUAREZ: 


Madam President.






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner Suarez is recognized.






 


 






MR. SUAREZ:


Thank you, Madam President. 






 


 






 


Will the proponent accept a simple amendment to his amendment which will be in connection with line 1?






 


 






 


We have heard many discussions regarding the
 way the Bill of Rights should be stated, emphatically by the honorable 
Vice-President. So bearing this in mind, this is the proposed amendment 
to the amendment.






 


 






 


Instead of a statement of a principle, let 
us begin with the word NO such that the proposed amendment will now 
read: NO PHYSICAL OR MENTAL PUNISHMENT SHALL BE EMPLOYED.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


Madam President, I would refer that proposed amendment to the Committee for its comment so that we can save time. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


What does the Committee say? 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


As I said in the beginning, as the Bill of Rights is now shaping up, 
we have 
two kinds of rights
 â rights which are 
self-implementing
 and rights which 
need implementation
. The rights which are self-implementing are generally worded in the way Commissioner Suarez would have it. 
But this particular right which we are putting in here is something which 
needs implementation
. So, actually, 
the effective provision here would be "should be dealt with BY LAW" because we are still dependent on law
.






 


 






MR. SUAREZ: 


May I add that my proposal is to make two 
sentences out of this proposed provision. So put a period (.) after 
"detainees" and continue the next sentence: "The use of inadequate . . 
."






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


How would it read now?






 


 






MR. SUAREZ:


It would read something like this: "NO 
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL PUNISHMENT SHALL BE EMPLOYED against CONVICTED 
prisoners or pretrial detainees. The use of INADEQUATE penal facilities 
UNDER subhuman conditions should be dealt with BY LAW." 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


I think the proposed amendment of Commissioner Maambong, when it speaks of "should be dealt with BY LAW," 
has reference not just to inadequate or substandard conditions, but even
 also
 to 
torture
. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


I confirm that, Madam President. 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


Yes. So, it does modify the sense of 
Commissioner Maambong's proposal. I would leave it to Commissioner 
Maambong to say whether he accepts that or not. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Actually, I am amenable to the use of the words "NO PHYSICAL or psychological. . ." 
But I really have a difficulty in separating the two things with the words "should be dealt with BY LAW"
 and I would rather agree with the Committee on this point.






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


At any rate, what Commissioner Suarez wants to be emphasized is already covered by other provisions.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Yes, Madam President.






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


This is 
more of a command to the State 
saying that beyond having recognized these things as prohibited, the 
State should do something to remedy whatever may be a violation
. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Yes. But I would just like to indicate, even though 
I cannot accept the amendment
,
 that the wording of Commissioner Suarez would indeed be more emphatic 
and it would have served my purpose better if it would not destroy the 
essence of the whole provision.






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


Yes.






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner Regalado is recognized. 






 


 






MR. REGALADO: 


Will the sponsor entertain an amendment to his amendment? 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Yes, Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


We are still on the amendment of Commissioner Suarez. 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


No. I will address it instead to Commissioner Maambong. 






 


 






MR. BENGZON:


Madam President, I think Commissioner Suarez is not going to insist on his amendment. So, may we allow him to withdraw?






 


 






MR. SUAREZ:


In as much as the word 
"corporal" has already been substituted with the word PHYSICAL, as 
stated by the honorable proponent. I will not insist on my amendment to 
the amendment because the sense is already very well conveyed. Thank 
you. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner Regalado desires to be recognized in relation to the proposed amendment.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


Yes, Madam President, 
but I would just like to make a statement. Considering that Commissioner
 Suarez mentioned "PHYSICAL" â I did say "corporal" â to save time, I 
would rather ask the Committee to allow me to change "corporal" to 
PHYSICAL; then, I will accept that amendment on the word PHYSICAL by 
Commissioner Suarez.






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner Regalado is recognized.






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


Madam President, I am 
proposing a further amendment to put some standards on this, to read: 
"The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING punishment ON 
ANY PRISONER."






 


 








Please permit me to 
explain. The punishment may not be physical but it could be degrading. 
Perhaps, the Members have seen the picture of that girl who was made to 
parade around the Manila International Airport with a placard slung on 
her neck, reading "I am a thief."






 


 








That is a degrading 
form of punishment. It may not necessarily be corporal nor physical. 
That is why I ask for the inclusion of OR DEGRADING "punishment" on this
 line and employment should be ON ANY PRISONER. It includes a convicted 
prisoner or a detention prisoner.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


Where would the words be? 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


"The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING punishment ON ANY PRISONER." This is all-inclusive.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


In other words, the 
Commissioner seeks to delete the words "against CONVICTED prisoners or 
pretrial detainees," and in its place would be "ON ANY PRISONER."






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


Because in penal law, 
there are two kinds of prisoners: the prisoners convicted by final 
judgment and those who are detention prisoners. Delete "or pretrial 
detainees"; then, "or the use of GROSSLY substandard or INADEQUATE penal
 facilities." 
If we just say "substandard." we have no basis to determine against what standard it should be considered
. But if we say "GROSSLY substandard," that is 
enough of a legislative indication and guideline
.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Madam President, before
 we take it up one by one, the Committee modification actually deleted 
the words "substandard or outmoded," and in its place, we put the word 
INADEQUATE. Is it the Gentleman's position that we should put back the 
word "substandard" instead of "INADEQUATE"?






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


I put both, "or the use
 of GROSSLY substandard or INADEQUATE penal facilities," because the 
penal facilities may be adequate for a specific purpose but it may be 
substandard when considered collectively and vice-versa; and then, 
we delete the rest, "should be dealt with BY LAW."
 That capsulizes, I think, the intent of the sponsor of the amendment.






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


If we add the word "GROSSLY," we are almost saying that the legislature should act only if the situation is gross.






 


 






MR. REGALADO: 


How do we determine what is substandard?






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


We leave that to the legislature.

 What I am saying is that the legislature could say: "Well, this is 
substandard but it is not grossly substandard; therefore, we need not do
 anything about it."






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


Could we have a happy 
compromise on how the substandard categorization could come in
 because 
it may be substandard from the standpoint of American models 
but
 it may be sufficient for us
?






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


I do not think we should go into great details on this. We are not legislating . . . 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


So, the sponsor's position is that 
we just 
leave it to the legislature
 to have a legislative 
standard of their own
 in the 
form of an ordinary legislation
?






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


Yes
.














MR. MAAMBONG:


Before I make any 
acceptance of the offered amendment, may I know from the Committee if on
 line 3, after the word "INADEQUATE," we should also replace 
"substandard" which we have cancelled earlier? 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


I do not know where we 
are now, but this is what I have. "The employment of PHYSICAL, 
psychological OR DEGRADING PUNISHMENT against CONVICTED PRISONERS ..." 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


"against ANY PRISONER. . ." They were thinking of any prisoner.






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


No, I put the word ON not "against." One inflicts the punishment on a person.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Yes. 






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


But the word "inflict" is not used but "employment" is used. So, the preposition is "against," not "ON." 






 


 






MR. REGALADO:


That is right; it is a matter of style.






 


 






MR. BENGZON: 


Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT: 


The Acting Floor Leader is recognized.






 


 






MR. BENGZON: 


May we just leave that 
to the Committee on Style? What is important is, we decide on the 
concept. If we can decide on the concept, then we can leave the style to
 the Committee on Style.






 


 






THE PRESIDENT: 


It should be left to 
the Committee on Style or to the Committee itself, to the Committee of 
Commissioner Bernas if they are agreed on the substance as to what is to
 be contained in the proposed amendment.






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


I just have one question on the substance. If we just say "ANY PRISONER," that may connote that 
the person is either a prisoner convicted or a pretrial prisoner and, therefore, charged
.
 I would much rather have ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE because a "prisoner" 
usually connotes someone who is convicted; a "detainee" could be on 
pretrial or not charged at all.






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


May we now have the recommendation of the Committee as to how this whole provision will read?






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


So, the recommendation 
of the Committee would be: "The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR
 DEGRADING punishment against ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE, or the use of 
INADEQUATE penal facilities UNDER subhuman conditions should be dealt 
with BY LAW."






 


 






MR. RODRIGO:


Madam President.






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Yes, Commissioner Rodrigo is recognized.






 


 






MR. RODRIGO: 


I would like to call 
attention to the fact that the word "DEGRADING" is already in the first 
sentence of this section: "Excessive fine shall not be imposed nor 
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment inflicted." So, why repeat the 
word "DEGRADING"?






 


 






FR. BERNAS: 


Precisely, Madam President, yesterday, we said that the provision we have in the present Constitution 
has reference to the punishment that is prescribed by the 
law itself
; 
whereas
 what we are dealing with here is 
the 
punishment
 or 
condition
 which is 
actually being practiced
 (
sic
). In other words, we are, in the present Constitution, 
talking about punishment which,
 if imposed by the law
, renders the law invalid
.






 


 








In this paragraph, we are 
describing 
conditions
 of detainees who may be 
held under valid laws 
but
 are being 
treated
 in a 
manner
 that is 
subhuman
 or 
degrading
.






 


 






MR. RODRIGO: 


So, that is the reason for repeating the word "DEGRADING." 






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


Yes, that is the reason.






 


 






MR. COLAYCO: 


Just one suggestion for the Committee. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT: 


Yes, Commissioner Colayco is recognized. 






 


 






MR. COLAYCO:


To shorten the 
sentence, I would suggest this: "The employment of PHYSICAL, 
psychological OR DEGRADING punishment IN ANY PLACE OF DETENTION." That 
will cover prisoners who are already convicted and those under detention
 or during trial.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


I am sorry I cannot accept that. I think the Committee has made a good job in modifying the sentence. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT: 


Will Commissioner Maambong please read his proposed amendment with all the suggestions that have come in? 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


Yes. It would read like
 this: "The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING 
punishment against ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE or the use of substandard or
 INADEQUATE penal facilities UNDER subhuman conditions should be dealt 
with BY LAW."






 


 






MR. FOZ:


Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner Foz is recognized.






 


 






MR. FOZ:


May I just ask one question of the proponent of the amendment[?] I get it that the law 
shall provide penalties for the conditions described by his amendment
. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


In line with the decisions of the Supreme Court on the interpretation of cruel and unusual punishments, 
there may be a law which punishes this violation precisely or there may not be a law
. What could happen is that 
the law could provide for some reliefs other than penalties
.






 


 








In the United States, 
there are what is known as injunctive or declaratory reliefs and that is
 not exactly in the form of a penalty. But 
I am not saying that the 
legislature is prevented from passing a law which will inflict 
punishment for violations of this section
.






 


 






MR. FOZ: 


In case the law passed 
by the legislature would impose sanctions, not so much in the case of 
the first part of the amendment but 
in the case of the second part

 with regard to substandard or outmoded legal penal facilities 
characterized by degrading surroundings and in sanitary or subhuman 
conditions,
 on whom
 should such sanctions be applied
?






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


It would have to be applied on the 
administrators
 of that penal institution
.
 In the United States, in my reading of the cases furnished to me by 
Commissioner Natividad, there are instances where the law or the courts 
themselves ordered the closure of a penal institution and, in extreme 
cases, in some states, they even set the prisoners free for violations 
of such a provision.






 


 






MR. FOZ:


I am concerned about 
the features described as substandard or outmoded penal facilities 
characterized by degrading surroundings, because 
we know very well the conditions in our jails
,
 particularly in the local jails. It is not really the fault of those in
 charge of the jails but these conditions are the result of lack of 
funds and the support by local government, in the first instance, and by
 the national government
.






 


 








Does the Gentleman think we should penalize the jailers for outmoded penal facilities?






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


No, Madam President. What we are trying to say is that 
lack of funds is a very convenient alibi for the State
, and I think with these provisions, 
the State should do something about it
.






 


 






MR. FOZ:


Thank you, Madam President. 






 


 






FR. BERNAS:


Madam President, 
we are 
not
 telling the legislature 
what to do
: we are just telling them that 
they should do something about it
. 






 


 






MR. DE CASTRO:


Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner de Castro is recognized. 






 


 






MR. DE CASTRO:


Thank you. 






 


 








The provision which 
says: "The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING PUNISHMENT
 against ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE SHALL be dealt with BY LAW" is already
 provided for by our present laws. We already have laws against 
third-degree punishments or even psychological punishments. 
Do we still need this provision
?






 


 








Thank you. Madam President.






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


As I was saying, Madam President, the law need not penalize; 
the law may only put in corrective measures as a remedy
. 






 


 






MR. REGALADO: 


Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Commissioner Regalado is recognized. 






 


 






MR. REGALADO: 


May I just rejoin the statement of Commissioner de Castro that we have laws already covering situations like this. 
The law we have on that in the Revised Penal Code is maltreatment of prisoners which comes from the original text 
maltratos de los encarcerados
. That presupposes that the prisoner is incarcerated.






 


 








The proposed 
legislation sought here will apply not only to incarcerated prisoners, 
but also to other detainees who, although not incarcerated, are 
nevertheless kept, their liberty of movement is controlled before 
incarceration. So, 
this is for the legislature to fill that void in the law
.






 


 






MR. GUINGONA:


Madam President. 






 


 






MR. BENGZON: 


Madam President. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT: 


Commissioner Guingona seeks to be recognized. 






 


 






MR. GUINGONA: 


Thank you, Madam President.






 


 








The description that 
our penal facilities are characterized by degrading surroundings under 
subhuman conditions, in my opinion, is already indicative of substandard
 or inadequate facilities. And, therefore, I was wondering whether or 
not the words "substandard or INADEQUATE" might be a surplusage.






 


 






MR. BENGZON: 


Madam President, the Committee is asking for a vote. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


Yes, but what is the phrasing now? 






 


 






MR. GUINGONA: 


May I ask, Madam President, for reply to my comment before we vote?






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG: 


May I make a very short
 reply on that. Precisely, the Committee has modified the original 
version by deleting the words "characterized by degrading surroundings, 
unsanitary or" because it is felt that that is a surplusage. 






 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


So, please read it now as it is now ready to be voted upon. 






 


 






MR. MAAMBONG:


Yes, Madam President. 
It will read: "The employment of PHYSICAL, psychological OR DEGRADING 
punishment against ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE or the use of substandard or
 INADEQUATE penal facilities UNDER subhuman conditions 
should be dealt with BY LAW
."






 


 








I now ask if this is acceptable to the Committee. 






 


 






VOTING








 


 






THE PRESIDENT:


This particular amendment has been accepted by the Committee and, therefore, we are now ready to vote.






 


 








As many as are in favor of this particular amendment, please raise their hand. (Several Members raised their hand.)






 


 








As many as are against, please raise their hand. (No Member raised his hand.) 






 


 








The results show 
28
 votes in favor and 
none
 against
; the amendment, as amended, is approved. (Emphases supplied)








The aforementioned exchanges show that Commissioner
 Maambong eventually softened his stance in rejecting Commissioner 
Bernas' proposal that the determination of what constitutes "substandard
 or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions" as well as 
"employment of physical, psychological, or degrading punishment" should 
best be left to the Legislature. This translated into an 
unopposed approval

 of Commissioner Bernas' proposal. As a result, Section 19 (2) of 
Article III of the present Constitution came into being; hereunder 
reproduced as follows:








2.


The employment of 
physical, psychological, or degrading punishment
 against any prisoner or detainee or the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions 
shall be dealt with by law
. (Emphasis supplied)








With all due respect, the undersigned disagrees 
with the opinions of Senior Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe 
(Justice Bernabe) and Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa 
(Justice Caguioa) who both echoed the US Supreme Court's ruling in 
Estelle, et al. v. Gamble
[121] 
that
 the Eighth Amendment establishes "the government's obligation to 
provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration" 
and that the "deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of 
prisoners constitutes 'unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.'" It 
bears stressing that, aside from this jurisdiction's judicial policy 
that this Court is not bound by the legal perspective expounded by the 
US Supreme Court,
[122]
 the US Constitution's Eighth Amendment 
radically differs

 from the Philippine Constitution's Section 19, Article III in terms of 
judicial enforceability. Both provisions are juxtaposed for comparison 
as follows:








PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION


UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION






Section 19, Article III


Eighth Amendment










1.


Excessive
 fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment 
inflicted. Neither shall death penalty be imposed, unless, for 
compelling reasons involving heinous crimes, the Congress hereafter 
provides for it. Any death penalty already imposed shall be reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
.










Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.










 










2.


The employment of physical, psychological, or degrading punishment against any prisoner or detainee or 
the use of substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions 
shall be dealt with by law
. (emphases supplied) 












Clearly, only Congress has the constitutional power to address subhuman conditions that plague our penal institutions.
[123]
 The Court 
cannot isolate
 Section 19 (1) and
 ignore 
Section 19 (2) if it is expected to uphold the Constitution. The fact that Section 19 
(2)
, Article III of the Philippine Constitution 
has no counterpart
 in the 
US Constitution
,
 patently shows that the framers of the Constitution had understood and 
realized the inherent and realistic financial limitation of 
congressional appropriation.


 Accordingly, the undersigned respectfully reiterates the 
basic
 principle that the Constitution is to be 
interpreted as a whole
.
[124]
 A constitutional provision 
should function to the full extent
 of its substance and its terms, not by itself alone, but in conjunction with all other provisions of that great document.
[125]

 No one provision of the Constitution is to be separated from all the 
others, to be considered alone, but that all the provisions bearing upon
 a particular subject are to be brought into view and to be so 
interpreted as to effectuate the great purposes of the instrumentâ 
sections bearing on a particular subject should be considered and 
interpreted together as to effectuate the whole purpose of the 
Constitution and 
one section is not to be allowed to defeat another
, if by any reasonable construction, the two can be made to stand together.
[126]

 In other words, a provision of the Constitution does not operate in 
isolation without regard to others. This is because the law must not be 
read in truncated parts, its provisions must be read in relation to the 
whole law.
[127]
 As such, 
cherry-picking
 principles in order to uphold a desired and pre-determined result not 
only betrays the solemn and constitutional duty of magistrates to be 
impartial but is also a fundamentally-proscribed indirect method of 
altering or repealing provisions of the Constitution
.
                  
 Furthermore, the scope of the term "law" has 
always been understood to be limited to congressionally-enacted 
statutes. It cannot be reasonably interpreted to mean or encompass 
either judicial decisions (including procedural rules promulgated by the
 Court in the exercise of its rule-making power) or administrative rules
 promulgated by the Executive Department 
without violating the basic principle of separation of powers
.
 It is a well-settled principle of constitutional construction that the 
language employed in the Constitution must be given their ordinary 
meaning except where technical terms are employed.
[128]


 In the case of Section 19 (2), Article III of 
the Constitution, there is nothing in the same provision which 
reasonably points to the possibility that the term "law" carries with it
 a technical meaning encompassing the common law practice of referring 
to judicial decisions as "laws." As pointed out earlier in the 
deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, the phrase 
"dealt with by law"
 has been clarified when Commissioner Florenz D. Regalado propounded the question: 
"How do we determine what is substandard?"
 to which Commissioner Bernas succinctly responded: 
"We leave that to the 
legislature
."

 This exchange leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the term "law" as 
used in Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitutionâit clearly 
refers to statutes enacted by Congress. Besides, jurisprudence is 
already settled that: (a) 
judicial decisions
 which apply and/or interpret the law 
are not laws
 although they are considered as "part of the law of the land;"
[129]
 and (b) 
administrative rules and regulations
, even if they "have the force and effect of law," 
are 
not 
laws
 as they do not establish demandable rights and enforceable obligations.
[130]

 For purposes of interpreting the term "law" in the context of Section 
19 (2), Article III of the Constitution, it is not difficult to fathom 
that there is a clear line demarcating between what is legislative and 
what is not. Accordingly, Congress has to act first by enacting a 
remedial statute before the Executive and the Judiciary can validly 
proceed to promulgate any measure if subhuman conditions of detention 
facilities are to be addressed in accordance with what the Constitution 
prescribes.
                  
 As such, it is unfair to insinuate that this 
Court is being "deliberately indifferent" to the petitioners' plight if 
it refuses to grant the instant petition when 
no less than the Constitution itself

 lodges the power of addressing "the use of substandard or inadequate 
penal facilities under subhuman conditions" on Congress. Those who feel 
that the duty (of addressing the subhuman conditions of detention 
facilities) should be shared by 
all 
branches of the government 
even without any enabling law should also be mindful that the only 
remedy at this point is a constitutional amendmentâ not an expanded but 
contrived interpretation of the Constitutionâ lest this Court do 
violence to the basic principle of separation of powers.
                  
 Moreover, Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution effectively preserved the doctrine in 
People v. Dionisio
[131]
 (promulgated during the time when the 1935 Constitution was still in effect) which espoused that "
[w]hat
 evils should be corrected as pernicious to the body politic, and 
how

 correction should be done, is a matter primarily addressed to the 
discretion of the legislative department, not of the courts." As to "
how
 correction should be done," the Court had already clarified in 
Lim, et al. v. People et al.
[132]
 thusly:
                  


 Settled is the rule that a punishment authorized
 by statute is not cruel, degrading or disproportionate to the nature of
 the offense unless it is 
flagrantly 
and
 plainly oppressive 
and
 wholly disproportionate

 to the nature of the offense as to shock the moral sense of the 
community. It takes more than merely being harsh, excessive, out of 
proportion or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to the Constitution
.
 Based on this principle, the Court has consistently overruled 
contentions of the defense that the penalty of fine or imprisonment 
authorized by the statute involved is cruel and degrading. (Emphasis 
supplied)




 To be considered as constitutionally repulsive under the afore-cited pronouncement in 
Lim
, a punishment prescribed by the statute 
itself
 must be flagrant and plainly oppressive 
as well

 as disproportionate. Consistent with the Constitutional Commission's 
deliberations on Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution, this 
pronouncement refers to the statute 
itself
 and 
not
 to the 
implementation
 of such statute. As such, the pronouncement in 
David, et al. v. Macapagal-Arroyo, et al.
[133] 
makes
 it straightforward and clear that "[t]he criterion by which the 
validity of the statute or ordinance is to be measured is the 
essential basis
 for the exercise of power, and 
not
 a 
mere incidental 
result
 arising 
from
 its 
exertion
." This means that a punishment 
per se
 as provided by law does not become cruel, degrading or inhuman due to the results of its implementation but due to the 
basis

 or legislative intention of its enactment. Besides, a cruel, degrading 
or inhuman manner of implementing an otherwise 
constitutionally-permissive punishment exposes the responsible public 
officer or employee to corresponding criminal, civil and administrative 
liabilities. Accordingly, the undersigned nevertheless finds it 
imperative and appropriate to point out that 
incidents 
in the 
implementation
 of a punishment have proper recourses and do not affect the validity of the statute or ordinance providing for such sanction.
                  
 Anent the 
flagrance
 (as contemplated in 
Lim
)
 of an oppressive or wholly disproportionate nature as one of the 
indicators that a punishment may be cruel, degrading or inhuman, the 
undersigned points out that detention 
per se
 which incidentally 
results in the deprivation of the prisoners' sanitation needs can hardly
 be equated to "torture" under R.A. No. 9745.
[134]
 Section 3 (a) of the same law states:
                  


 (a) "Torture" refers to an act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is 
intentionally
 inflicted
 on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him/her or a third person information or a confession; 
punishing
 him/her for an act he/she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed; or 
intimidating
 or 
coercing
 him/her or a third person; or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is 
inflicted
 by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a person in authority or agent of a person in authority. 
It does 
not
 include
 pain or suffering arising only from, 
inherent
 in or 
incidental
 to lawful sanctions
. (Emphases supplied)




 The terms of the aforementioned provision clearly contemplate unlawful instances of 
flagrant
 or 
intentional
 infliction of pain or suffering on the part of the perpetrator. Any pain or suffering 
inherent
 in or 
incidental
 to lawful sanctions are 
excluded

 from the definition of "torture." This only means that, if any pain or 
suffering arises incidental to or due to the inherent nature of a 
punishment or sanction imposed by legislature, the same may not be 
deemed as "torture" to invoke the constitutional prohibition against 
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment for being flagrant. Although not 
committed to the idea that only torture constitutes cruel, degrading and
 inhuman punishment, the undersigned still maintains its prudent stand 
that Legislature is the 
only
 branch of government tasked under 
Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution to address subhuman 
conditions in jails and other detention facilities. Such taskâof either 
enacting
 a special appropriations law or 
including
 in its yearly general appropriations law funds and measures for the upliftment of jail conditionsâ
cannot be forced upon Congress by any judicial 
writ
.
 Regrettably, the basic principle of checks-and-balances do not allow 
this Court to consider the petitioners as continually being subjected to
 torture in their present detention conditions absent any indication of 
flagrance on the respondents' part as it will unduly expand the 
statutory definition of torture. Besides, judicial review may only be 
resorted to when there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
 excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of 
the governmentânot work as a peremptory 
writ
 of 
mandamus
 improperly applied to compel the performance of an inherently discretionary act such as legislation.
                  
 In conclusion, the undersigned reiterates that the 
extent

 of judicial remedies should only be those which are circumscribed by 
substantive law if the fundamental constitutional doctrine of separation
 of powers is to be respected. The Judiciary must function within its 
sphere of its powerâwhich does not include the power to order either the
 Legislative to enact a law or the Executive to issue a particular 
implementing rule not mandated by any statute.
                  
 
Last
, courts are not 
constitutionally empowered, to issue advisory opinions or promulgate 
rules, even thru adjudication, which amount to giving details as to the 
implementation of statutory provisions.
                  




 A "justiciable controversy" refers to an 
existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for judicial 
determination, not one that is conjectural or merely anticipatory.
[135]

 A petition must show "an active antagonistic assertion of a legal right
 on one side and a denial thereof on the other concerning a real, and 
not a mere theoretical question or issue."
[136]

 In other words, courts have no authority to: (a) pass upon issues 
through advisory opinions; (b) resolve hypothetical or feigned problems 
as well as friendly suits collusively arranged between parties without 
real adverse interests; and (c) adjudicate mere academic questions to 
satisfy scholarly interests, however intellectually challenging.
[137]


 Concomitantly, this Court has the 
constitutional power, among others, to promulgate rules of pleading, 
practice and procedure as well as of those concerning the protection and
 enforcement of constitutional rights.
[138]

 Comparatively, administrative agencies have the power to make rules and
 regulations which results in delegated legislation that is within the 
confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non-delegability 
and separability of powers.
[139]


 As regards the broad standards set by the 
Nelson Mandela Rules as well as the generic terms used in Section 4 (a) 
of the Bureau of Corrections Act, the Court has no power to promulgate 
rules or even order thru adjudication the 
specific manner
 on 
how
 to implement 
specific protective measures

 which the inmates are entitled. Such power of "subordinate legislation"
 belongs to administrative agencies to "fill in the gaps of a statute 
for its proper and effective implementation" by virtue of their 
expertise in their fields of specialization.
[140]
 In other words, providing for details as to 
how
 a provision of law will be 
carried out
 or 
implemented

 is part of executiveânot judicialâfunctions. Moreover, it also goes 
without saying that the Bureau of Corrections is duty-bound under 
Sections 3 and 4 of the Bureau of Corrections Act to look after the 
welfare of the inmates even "including families of inmates and their 
victims." Consequently, 
this Court would be engaging in subordinate 
legislation if it supplies the details on how to implement the Bureau of
 Corrections Act
 instead of providing for rules on either pleading 
and practice or protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. 
However, this realization that judicial functions do not include the 
duty to "fill in the gaps of the statute" should be distinguished from 
the courts' power to strike down laws or administrative issuances for 
being unconstitutional or invalid. In this case, striking down portions 
of administrative issuances does not result in the creation of new rules
 or new entitlementsâ it merely renders such stricken portions 
ineffectual.
                    
 As pointed out by Chief Justice Peralta, 
unless there is clear showing that the petitioners are actually 
suffering from a medical condition that requires immediate and 
specialized attention outside of their confinementâas, for instance, an 
actual and proven exposure to or infection with the SARS-CoV-2âthey must
 remain in custody and isolation incidental to the crimes with which 
they were charged, or for which they are being tried or serving 
sentence. Only then can there be an actual controversy and a proper 
invocation of humanitarian and equity considerations that is ripe for 
this Court to determine.
                    
 Associate Justice Rodil V. Zalameda (Justice
 Zalameda) also shares a complementary view that contracting COVID-19 
has become more speculative than real because there is no such case in 
petitioners' actual detention facility due to isolation from the public.
 This negates the actual risk of contracting COVID-19 despite congestion
 and despite their health condition. And although congested facilities 
may hasten the spread of COVID-19, such disease is not borne solely out 
of congested facilities. Furthermore, Justice Zalameda points out that 
the petitioners: (a) did not inform this Court of the COVID-19 situation
 in the areas where they propose to stay for their temporary release; 
and (b) did not show whether they will actually be in a better physical 
environment during their temporary releaseâas their possible temporary 
release during the duration of the ECQ should also be subject to 
monitoring by the State.
                    
 Take for example the case of petitioner 
Reina Mae A. Nasino who was then pregnant while being detained and is 
currently facing charges for violations of R.A. No. 10591 and R.A. No. 
9165. This Court cannot automatically and unfairly assume that the 
Bureau of Corrections is ill-equipped and inept in handling cases of 
pregnant inmates whether regarding their safekeeping or assisting during
 childbirth and rearing. To order the Bureau of Corrections to 
"undertake measures to protect pregnant inmates and their unborn 
children" would be an empty and redundant display of judicial 
powerâamounting to a mere advisory opinion. Besides, it is premature to 
order any protective measure for safe delivery of pregnant inmates who 
have yet to give birth to their children. It is only when there is a 
lapse or deliberate neglect on the Bureau of Correction's performance of
 its duty resulting in injury to both mother and child or a violation of
 the pregnant inmate's right to be taken care of during childbirth can a
 cause (or even a right) of action arise. To recover at all, there must 
be some cause of action at the commencement of the suit.
[141]
 Ultimately, 
this
 is up to the DOJ (in coordination with the Bureau of Corrections), CSC,
 DBM and DOF to determine the specific measures in which to protect the 
inmates in the custody of all detention facilities in the country
.
                    




On Releasing the Petitioners Pursuant to Equity:
 






In order to determine whether or not the 
petitioners (who pray for their temporary release on bail or 
recognizance for health and age reasons as well as for the creation of a
 "Prisoner Release Committee" with the accompanying issuance of ground 
rules for such release) may successfully invoke "equity" or "equity 
jurisdiction," it is necessary for the undersigned to explain the legal 
system of the Philippines and its ramifications in terms of 
adjudication.
                    
 At the outset, there are two (2) main 
categories of legal systems or traditions that originally came out of 
Europe: (a) the civil law system; and (b) the common law system. 
Countries like Spain, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy and Switzerland 
have been traditionally labelled as civil law jurisdictions;
[142]

 while countries such as the United Kingdom (except Scotland which 
partly adopts the civil law system), the United States of America (US), 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries of the British 
Commonwealth have been known as common law jurisdictions.
[143]


 The civil law system (sometimes referred to 
as "statute law" or "statutory law" system by some legal scholars) 
pertains to the practice of deciding cases based on explicit provisions 
of law enacted by an authority like the legislature in the case of 
statutes or the people themselves in the case of constitutions. Here, 
courts ought to recognize "the generative capacity of legislation" for, 
according to orthodox civil law theory, a statute is conceived of as 
"being the most satisfactory and perfect method of realizing justice," 
and as the "unique source of judicial decisions."
[144]

 In other words, Congress (or the people in the case of the 
Constitution) has the plenary power to enact laws pertaining to persons 
or things within its territorial jurisdiction; either to introduce new 
laws or repeal the old, unless prohibited expressly or by implication by
 the Constitution or limited or restrained by its own.
[145]
 Concomitantly, case laws of civil law jurisdictions are governed by the doctrine of 
jurisprudence constante
.
 Under the latter doctrine, a single decision is not binding on courts 
but, when a series of decisions form a "constant stream of uniform and 
homogenous rulings having the same reasoning," 
jurisprudence constante
 applies and operates with "considerable persuasive authority."
[146]


 Contrastingly, the common law system 
(sometimes refer to as "judge-made law" or "customary law" by some legal
 scholars) pertains to the practice of settling disputes based on 
customs supplemented with the general principles of justice, fairness 
and equity. In this legal system, parties to the dispute anchor their 
claims or defenses on common practices which they need to substantiate 
with evidence before the courts. Relatedly, case laws in common law 
jurisdictions are governed by the doctrine of 
stare decisis
[147]

 where principles which have been laid out in prior decisions create a 
binding precedents as regards future decisions dealing with essentially 
the same factual and/or legal questions.
[148]
 This has the effect of rendering such prior judicial decisions as "customs" which essentially operate to bind future rulings.
[149]

 Adherents to the common law system claim that their courts "find" 
rather than "make" the law and, "in doing so are fashioning and refining
 the law as it then existed in light of reason and experience;" thereby 
bringing "the law into conformity with reason and common sense."
[150]

 They also claim that "those acts of Parliament, which have from time to
 time been made to enforce this universal law, or to facilitate the 
execution of [its] decisions, are not to be considered as introductive 
of any new rule, but merely as declaratory of the old fundamental 
constitutions of the Kingdom; without which it must cease to be a part 
of the civilized world."
[151]
 
In other words, common law consider statutes as merely re-affirmations 
of universal principles "discovered" thru logical reasoning and 
presumably used by judges in settling a particular dispute. Moreover, 
the practice where "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice"
[152] 
is the legal norm.
                    
 The Philippines practices the mixed legal 
system due to its Spanish and American influence during the colonial 
periods. Its legal system which comprises 
primarily
 (and predominantly) of the civil law system inherited from Spain 
supplemented
 by common law principles inherited from the US.
                    
 The civil law aspect of the Philippine legal system derives its foundations from: (a) the presently defunct Act No. 2127
[153]
 which mandates that the language of the text of the law shall prevail in the interpretation of laws;
[154]
 (b) the judicially-institutionalized maxims of 
verba legis non est recedendum
[155] 
(from the words of a statute there should be no departure) and 
noscitur a sociis
[156] 
(where
 a particular word or phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally 
susceptible of various meanings, its correct construction may be made 
clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is 
founded or with which it is associated); (c) Articles 7 and 10 of the 
Civil Code where "[l]aws are repealed only by subsequent ones, and their
 violation or non-observance shall not be excused by disuse, or custom 
or practice to the contrary" and "[i]n case of doubt in the 
interpretation or application of laws, it is presumed that the lawmaking
 body intended right and justice to prevail;"
[157]

 and (d) the constitutional power of this Court "to determine whether or
 not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of 
the Government"
[158]
 and assess whether or not there is failure to act in contemplation of law.
[159]


 Concomitantly, the common law aspect of the 
Philippine legal system traces its roots from: (a) Articles 8 and 9 of 
the Civil Code where "[j]udicial decisions applying or interpreting the 
laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the 
Philippines" and "[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment 
by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws;" and 
(b) the long-standing judicial adage that "equity follows the law."
[160]


 As to the legal effect of case laws, the Philippines exercises a unique brand of the common law doctrine of 
stare decisis
.
 Up to a certain degree, this Court will uphold an established precedent
 and, if need be, evaluate such prior ruling by: (a) determining whether
 the rule has proved to be intolerable simply in defying practical 
workability; (b) considering whether the rule is subject to a kind of 
reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of 
overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation; (c) determining 
whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have the 
old rule no more than a remnant of an abandoned doctrine; and, (d) 
finding out whether facts have so changed or come to be seen 
differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application 
or justification.
[161]
 It does
 not strictly and rigidly adhere to precedents akin to those of common 
law jurisdictions like the United Kingdom where judges make law as 
binding as an Act of Parliament.
[162]


 In line with the aforementioned backdrop of 
the Philippine legal system, the undersigned will now proceed with the 
merits of the case.
                    
 Here, the petitioners ask this Court to 
exercise its "equity jurisdiction" and to: (a) order their release on 
bail or on recognizance on humanitarian reasons; (b) order the creation 
of a "Prisoner Release Committee" to facilitate the release of all other
 clinically-vulnerable inmates all throughout the country; and (c) 
promulgate ground rules relevant to the release of eligible 
prisonersâall on the ground of "equity"
                    
 The undersigned maintains that this Court cannot grant their prayers due to the following reasons:
                    
 
First
, this Court cannot allow the release of the petitioners on the ground of equity without violating the Constitution.
                    
 Adoption by the Philippines of the civil law
 tradition as its predominant or primary attribute of its legal system 
finds its support in the principle of checks-and-balances or separation 
of powers. By the well-known distribution of the powers of government 
among the executive, legislative, and judicial departments by the 
Constitution, there was provided that marvelous scheme of check and 
balances which has been the wonder and admiration of the statesmen, 
diplomats, and jurists in every part of the civilized world.
[163]

 In this system, the Legislative makes the law, the Executive implements
 the law, and the Judiciary applies and/or interprets the law. This 
tripartite distribution of powers is inherent in democratic governments 
where no single branch may dominate another. Stated differently, the 
principle of checks-and-balances is inherently woven into the fabric of 
democracy.
                    
 Under the Philippine civil law tradition, courts are principally bound to apply the law
[164]
 and in such a way that it does not usurp legislative powers by judicial legislation.
[165]
 It is only when the law is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning may the court interpret or construe its true intent.
[166]

 It ensures that laws are given full effect and that judicial doctrines 
are stable and consistent so that those who are bound may reasonably 
rely upon them in planning their affairs.
[167]


 Notwithstanding the presence of a 
considerably moderate leeway that the Judiciary enjoys in interpreting 
constitutional and statutory provisions, it is imperative to emphasize 
that there is a sharp distinction between: (a) liberal construction 
which courts are able to find out the true meaning of statutes from the 
language used, the subject matter, and the purposes of those framing 
them; and (b) the act of a court in engrafting upon a law something that
 has been omitted which someone believes ought to have been embracedâthe
 former is a legitimate exercise of judicial power while the latter is 
judicial legislation forbidden by the tripartite division of powers 
among the three departments of government.
[168]

 It presupposes that any perceived "gap" or legal vacuum should be 
within the parameters set by law for courts have no authority to 
short-circuit the democratic process of legislation and determine for 
themselves thru interpretation the best policy that should have been 
clearly enunciated by such statutes. As such, courts should always be 
mindful that, in establishing doctrines, it does not tread on the powers
 of Legislatureâwhose members are duly elected by the People as their 
representatives and as their instruments of enacting their Sovereign 
Will. This judicial paradigm 
ensures that the possibility of grave abuse of discretion is mitigated and that decisions are tethered to the law
.
 Accordingly, it may be said that the primary duty of adhering to the 
text of the law is in recognition of the inherent nature of the 
democratic process wherein the people elect their representatives who, 
in turn, choose and pursue the appropriate policies on the former's 
behalf. Moreover, the principal judicial recourse of adhering to the 
text of the law before utilizing extrinsic aids or extraneous sources is
 the ultimate manifestation of impartiality and the most objective of 
ways to apply and interpret the law.
                    
 Presently, there is 
no
 constitutional provision or law which
 automatically

 grants bail, releases on recognizance or allows other modes of 
temporary liberty to all accused or inmates who are 
clinically-vulnerable (
i.e
. sickly, elderly or pregnant). As it 
stands, courts concerned will still have to consider the following 
guidelines for bail in Sections 5 and 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules 
of Criminal Procedure which is quoted hereunder:
                    


 Section 5. Bail, when discretionary. â Upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
,
 or life imprisonment, admission to bail is discretionary. The 
application for bail may be filed and acted upon by the trial court 
despite the filing of a notice of appeal, provided it has not 
transmitted the original record to the appellate court. However, if the 
decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of
 the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can
 only be filed with and resolved by the appellate court.


 Should the court grant the application, the 
accused may be allowed to continue on provisional liberty during the 
pendency of the appeal under the same bail subject to the consent of the
 bondsman.


 If the penalty imposed by the trial court is 
imprisonment exceeding six (6) years, the accused shall be denied bail, 
or his bail shall be cancelled upon a showing by the prosecution, with 
notice to the accused, of the following or other similar circumstances:








(a)


That he
 is a recidivist, quasi-recidivist, or habitual delinquent, or has 
committed the crime aggravated by the circumstance of reiteration; 






 


 






(b)


That he has 
previously escaped from legal confinement, evaded sentence, or violated 
the conditions of his bail without valid justification; 






 


 






(c)


That he committed the offense while under probation, parole, or conditional pardon; 






 


 






(d)


That the circumstances of his case indicate the probability of flight if released on bail; or






 


 






(e)


That there is undue risk that he may commit another crime during the pendency of the appeal.








The appellate court may, 
motu proprio
 or on motion of any party, review the resolution of the Regional Trial Court after notice to the adverse party in either case.




 x x x 
                    


 Section 9. Amount of bail; guidelines. â The 
judge who issued the warrant or granted the application shall fix a 
reasonable amount of bail considering primarily, but not limited to, the
 following 
factors
:








(a)


Financial ability of the accused to give bail; 






 


 






(b)


Nature and circumstances of the offense;






 


 






(c)


Penalty for the offense charged; 






 


 






(d)


Character and reputation of the accused;






 


 






(e)


Age and health of the accused
;






 


 






(f)


Weight of the evidence against the accused; 






 


 






(g)


Probability of the accused appearing at the trial; 






 


 






(h)


 Forfeiture of other bail;






 


 






(i)


The fact that accused was a fugitive from justice when arrested; and






 


 






(j)


Pendency of other cases where the accused is on bail.






Excessive bail shall not be required. (Emphasis supplied)






 The above-mentioned enumerations clearly pertain to 
purely factual questions

 that trial courts are equipped to pass upon. Moreover, the 
consideration of these factors which includes others not mentioned but 
are analogous to the ones provided means that such guidelines 
do not work in isolation
.
                    
 In this case, the ground of "humanitarian reasons" raised by the petitioners 
only concerns the fifth factor
âage
 and health of the accused. This means that, if this Court will make a 
pronouncement which automatically grants bail or recognizance thereby 
dispensing with the task of evaluating all the factors, such 
predetermination of an entitlement to provisional liberty will 
effectively 
create a class
 of prisoners 
with a substantive right
 for it is clear that inmates who are liberated are better off than those who are not. 
Substantive law

 is that part of the law which creates, defines and regulates rights, or
 which regulates the right and duties which in turn give rise to a cause
 of action; that part of the law which courts are established to 
administer; as opposed to 
adjective or remedial law
, which prescribes the method of enforcing rights or obtain redress for their invasions.
[169]
 Since the function of adjudication implies a determination of facts,
[170]
 dispensing with such function of evaluation will also have the effect of 
creating a substantive right
.
 A judicial pronouncement which predetermines an eligibility or 
entitlement does not anymore undergo a "method of enforcing rights or 
obtaining redress of their invasions" which is the very essence of being
 "adjective" or "remedial" thereby intruding into the sphere of 
substantive law.
                    
 Admittedly, the Court may "fill in the gaps" of the law in some circumstances.
[171]

 But such "gaps" should be within the parameters of the law and such act
 of "filling" should not amount to the creation of a substantive right 
with a corresponding substantive obligation. Besides, the factors in 
Section 9, Rule 114 are intended to "fix a reasonable amount of bail." 
In other words, they cannot be used in the same manner as the factors in
 Section 5 of the same Rule to determine whether an accused is entitled 
to bail.
                    
 Here, the undersigned acknowledges that, 
under Section 25 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Executive 
Judges of the Regional Trial Courts have the responsibility to "conduct 
monthly personal inspections of provincial, city, and municipal jails 
and their prisoners within their respective jurisdictions;" "ascertain 
the number of detainees, inquire on their proper accommodation and 
health and examine the condition of the jail facilities;" and "order the
 segregation of sexes and of minors from adults, ensure the observance 
of the right of detainees to confer privately with counsel, and strive 
to eliminate conditions inimical to the detainees." However, this does 
not mean that the "age and health of the accused" shall be the only 
determining factor for the grant or denial of bail (assuming for the 
sake of argument that the factors in Sections 5 and 9 are 
interchangeable) as it is obvious that there are other factors that 
courts in bail applications should consider.
                    
 Relatedly, the creation of a "Prisoner 
Release Committee" entails the need for establishing funds for 
operational purposes. Since Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution 
explicitly states that appropriation bills shall originate exclusively 
at the House of Representatives, any attempt on the part of this Court 
to order (premised on interpretation) for a disbursement or release of 
funds for a particular purpose which is devoid of any constitutional or 
statutory fiat will cross the realm of legislative functions. Granting 
reliefs or inventing remedies which are totally devoid of clear 
constitutional or statutory basis is simply 
ultra vires
. As 
maintained by Justice Bernabe, it is beyond the power of the Court to 
institute policies that are not judicial in nature. She further explains
 that, while the Court understands the plight of petitioners in light of
 this unprecedented public health emergency, the creation of a similar 
Prisoner Release Committee is a policy matter best left to the 
discretion of the political branches of government.
                    
 At this point, it becomes noteworthy to 
stress that the civil law tradition does not essentially allow courts to
 craft policies of substantive import. In a book co-authored with Bryan 
A. Garner (famously known as the Editor-in-Chief of Black's Law 
Dictionary), the late former US Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin 
Scalia laments:
                    


 Ours is a common-law tradition in which 
judicial improvisation has abounded. Statutes were a comparatively 
infrequent source of English law through the mid-19th century. Where 
statutes did not exist, the law was the product of judicial invention, 
at least in those many areas where there was no accepted common law for 
courts to "discover." It is unsurprising that the judges who used to be 
the lawgivers took some liberties with the statutes that began to 
supplant their handiworkâadopting, for example, a rule that statutes in 
derogation of the common law (judge-made law) were to be narrowly 
construed and rules for filling judicially perceived "gaps" in statutes 
that had less to do with perceived meaning than with the judges' notions
 of public policy. Such distortion of texts that have been adopted by 
the people's elected representatives is undemocratic. In an age when 
democratically prescribed texts (such as statutes, ordinances, and 
regulations) are the rule, the judge's principal function is to give 
those texts their fair meaning.


 Some judges, however, refuse to yield the 
ancient judicial prerogative of making the law, improvising on the text 
to produce what they deem socially desirable resultsâusually at the 
behest of an advocate for one party to a dispute. The judges are also 
prodded by interpretive theorists who avow that courts are "better able 
to discern and articulate basic national ideals than are the people's 
politically responsible representatives." On this view, judges are to 
improvise "basic national ideals of individual liberty and fair 
treatment, even when the content of these ideals is not expressed as a 
matter of positive law in the written Constitution."


 To the extent that people give this view any 
credence, the notion that judges may (even should) improvise on 
constitutional and statutory text enfeebles the democratic polity. As 
Justice John Marshall Marian warned in the 1960s, an invitation to 
judicial lawmaking results inevitably in "a lessening, on the one hand, 
of judicial independence and, on the other, of legislative 
responsibility, thus polluting the bloodstream of our system of 
government." Why these alarming outcomes? First, when judges fashion law
 rather than fairly derive it from governing texts, they subject 
themselves to intensified political pressuresâin the appointment 
process, in their retention, and in the arguments made to them. Second, 
every time a court constitutionalizes a new sliver of lawâas by finding a
 "new constitutional right" to do this, that, or the otherâthat sliver 
becomes henceforth untouchable by the political branches. In the 
American system, a legislature has no power to abridge a right that has 
been authoritatively held to be part of the Constitutionâeven if that 
newfound right does not appear in the text. Over the past 50 years 
especially, we have seen the judiciary incrementally take control of 
larger and larger swaths of territory that ought to be settled 
legislatively.


 It used to be said that judges do not "make" lawâthey simply apply it. In the 20
th

 century, the legal realists convinced everyone that judges do indeed 
make law. To the extent that this was true, it was knowledge that the 
wise already possessed and the foolish could not be trusted with. It was
 true, that is, that judges did not really "find" the common law but 
invented it over time. Yet this notion has been stretched into a belief 
that judges "make" law through judicial interpretation of democratically
 enacted statutes. x x x
[172]




 In the context of US Constitutional law, the 
aforementioned commentary will surely spark debates. Aside from the fact
 that the US had always considered itself as a common law jurisdiction 
since its inception, a perennial theoretical battle has always divided 
the US Supreme Court into two (2) opposing ideological camps primarily 
because of the "unenumerated rights clause" in the Ninth Amendment of 
their Constitution which reads:
                    


 The enumeration in the Constitution, of 
certain rights
, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. (Emphasis supplied)




 The "liberal" justices of the US Supreme Court 
posit that they are constitutionally-empowered and authorized to 
recognize these "certain rights" which are "implied" by their 
Constitution. They are mostly known to be advocates of the "Living 
Constitution" doctrine where it is ideal to "interpret" the provisions 
in such a way as they "adapt to the times" and "as understood and 
intended by the people of the present." The "conservative" justices, on 
the other hand, argue that it should be Congressâbeing the people's 
representativesâwho are constitutionally-authorized to determine these 
"implied certain rights." They believe that it is "undemocratic" to have
 the unelected judges craft or select policies to meet the exigent needs
 of the times. Understandably, the terms "certain rights" in the Ninth 
Amendment makes Justice Scalia's conservative and highly-textualist 
statements controversial in the arena of US Constitutional law 
discussions.
                    
 In the context of Philippine Constitutional 
law discussions, such "conservative-versus-liberal" debates have little 
bearing or relevance to jurisprudence. The present Philippine 
Constitution, although it draws most of its significant provisions from 
the US Constitution, does not have a provision similar or related to the
 "unenumerated rights clause" of the Ninth Amendment which suggests 
either the existence of implied rights or that the legal system or 
tradition should predominantly adhere or be based on common law instead 
of civil law. The Declaration of Principles and State Policies in 
Article II as well as the Bill of Rights in Article III contain no such 
"unenumerated rights" provision. Neither does Article VIII nor all the 
other articles in the Constitution have the effect of giving the 
Judiciary the power to "determine" any right which may have been 
"implied" in the Constitution. In fact, the opposite seems to be the 
case as it is explicitly shown in Section 1, Article VIII of the 
Constitution which states:
                    


 Section 1. The 
judicial power
 shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.


 Judicial power
 includes
 the 
duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies
 involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to 
determine
 whether or not there has been a 
grave abuse of discretion
 amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. (Emphasis supplied)




 There is nothing in the aforementioned provision
 that the power "to settle actual controversies" which can be 
interpreted to mean that the Judiciary may "recognize certain rights" 
implied in the Constitution thru interpretation or simple application of
 laws. Even the word "includes," when used in the context of the whole 
second paragraph clearly appears to merely enumerate or state the 
scope

 of "judicial power" which includes both the duty toâ(a) settle actual 
controversies; and (b) determine whether or not there has been a grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the 
part of any branch or instrumentality of the government. Moreover, it 
cannot be reasonably implied that the term "justice" in the phrase 
"courts of justice" gives magistrates an unfettered prerogative of 
straying away from legislative enactments. On the contrary, the phrase 
"to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction" strongly suggests that even
 judicial functions should be within the parameters of the law. Such 
principle is shown by rulings explaining that the 
writ
 of 
certiorari'
s purpose is supervisory to keep inferior courts within the parameters of their respective jurisdictions.
[173]
 Since jurisdiction is "the power and authority of a court to hear, try, and decide a case"
[174]
 "conferred only by the Constitution or by statute,"
[175]
 it is inevitable to assume that explicit provisions define the limits of judicial power only to those matters 
within the confines
 of the law.
                    
 Besides, the adjudicative approach of 
primarily resorting or deferring to the text of the law is not without 
cogent reasons. It greatly minimizes, if not removes, any personal and 
subconscious bias that an unelected magistrate may inadvertently factor 
in weighing the rights or interests and obligations of conflicting 
parties. This is the reason why a judge must always maintain cold 
neutrality and impartiality for he or she is a magistrate, not an 
advocate.
[176]
 Moreover, such 
approach is also in recognition of the idea that, in a democratic and 
republican system of government, laws are borne out of the general 
consensus of the people's directly chosen representatives. It ensures 
that magistrates do not wander far away into their own subjective 
preferences. As such, what it says according to the text of the 
provision to be construed compels acceptance and negates the power of 
the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the 
people mean what they say.
[177]


 Accordingly, those claiming that the resort 
to common law is "progressive" fail to realize that even such legal 
tradition is as ancient as the civil law tradition relative to the 
modern times. The idea is not novel or revolutionary such as to create a
 messianic realization that our Judiciary, all on its own, should 
suddenly discard the civil law aspect of its legal tradition and wholly 
replace it with common law.
                    
 However, the undersigned is not saying that 
the Philippines cannot change the primary aspect of its legal system or 
tradition from civil law to common law. Such shift in legal tradition 
should be done in a constitutionally-permissible manner. Stated 
differently, there are constitutionally-sanctioned processes or remedies
 available to change a policy, governmental structure, or legal culture.
 These processes should not be bypassed for the sake of convenience or 
disputable exigencies if this government is one "of laws and not of 
men." All that the undersigned is emphasizing is that a shift in legal 
tradition would require no less than a constitutional (or legislative 
for purely statutory rights and obligations) amendment or revision
[178]
âa
 process explicitly sanctioned in the Constitution itself. For now, the 
Judiciary cannot short-circuit the legislative democratic process and 
invent a new right in the guise of interpretation.
                    
 At some point, the people should be able to 
bear the brunt of being responsible in their exercise of the 
constitutional right to suffrage. The present existing policies are but 
fruits of the seeds sowed by the people thru the exercise of their right
 to vote. Policies are virtually the results of public consensusâof 
majoritarian choice, if the basic ideals of democracy itself are to be 
respected. Those who are unhappy with these policies have the option to 
vote for a new set of officials come elections. For the majority, this 
is relatively effortless; but for the minority, it is up to them to 
convince
 those on the other side on the 
merits
 of their choicesâthere should be 
no compulsion
,
 even thru judicial enforcement, as it is a vice on sovereign will; 
unless, of course, fundamental rights are arbitrarily violated. More 
importantly, those principles and values that we have come to accept as 
"absolute" or to recognize as "inherent" did not even start out as 
suchâthey arose and developed as a result of the people's collective and
 cumulative experiences as well as their corresponding responses over 
time. We might hold some values or principles dear to our hearts, but 
that does not mean that we are absolutely entitled to legally enforce 
them against others just because we strongly believe in them; more so 
that strong personal beliefs especially of unelected magistrates do not 
make general consensus. These values and principles 
must first be recognized
 by the Constitution or law 
in a clear and discernible manner
.
 Surely, principles and values are not static just as all the other 
aspects of the world that influence or dictate our lives; but they have 
to function according to the legal platform in which they are 
recognized.
                    
 Besides, society has matured to the point 
where a fundamental safeguard known as the Bill of Rights have been 
positively recognized in the Constitution instead of implied from the 
vague and undefined concept of common or natural law. Thru experience 
and thru democracy's emergence, fears that fundamental rights and 
freedoms might be trumped by the arbitrariness of government's 
legislature in wielding its power have long dissipated. The Constitution
 had already placed sovereign power in the hands of the people and had 
bound the hands of the government from abusing its power.
                    
 
Second
, courts cannot take an 
unbridled approach of considering anything judicially-perceived to be 
"lacking" in the text of the law as "gaps" which instantaneously call 
for the application of equity because it violates the principle of 
separation of powers.
                    
 Equity is the principle by which substantial
 justice may be attained in cases where the prescribed or customary 
forms of ordinary law are inadequate.
[179]
 It has been described as ""justice outside legality."
[180]

 As the complement of legal jurisdiction, equity seeks to reach and do 
complete justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their
 rules and want of power to adapt their judgments to the special 
circumstances of cases, are incompetent so to do.
[181]


 In its previous rulings, this Court has 
applied the concept of "equity jurisdiction" to: (1) relax stringent 
procedural rules in order to serve substantial justice or to resolve the 
case on its merits based on the evidence;
[182]
 (2) prevent unjust enrichment and ensure restitution;
[183]
 (3) reconvey land to the party found to be the true owner;
[184]

 (4) appoint a receiver in an intra-corporate dispute to prevent waste 
and dissipation of assets and commission of illegal acts as well as 
redress the injuries of the minority stockholders against the wrongdoing
 of the majority;
[185]
 (5) 
review the records of the case in order to determine which findings 
should be preferred as more conformable to the evidentiary facts;
[186]

 (6) adjusting the rights of parties in accordance with the 
circumstances obtaining at the time of rendition of judgment by reducing
 the cost of the land in a contract of sale due to the "depreciation of 
currencies" 
vis-Ã -vis
 the costs of completion of construction;
[187]
 (7) fix the reckoning point of interest from the date of the finality of the decision;
[188]
 (8) reduce interests and penalties;
[189]

 (9) compel the registered owner to reconvey the right, interest, share 
and participation in the registered parcel of the one lawfully entitled 
thereto;
[190]
 (10) settle boundary disputes;
[191]

 (11) appoint a "special master" to conduct and supervise an election of
 directors when it appears that a fair election cannot otherwise be had;
[192]

 (12) remand the case to the trial Court for determination on the merits
 of the issue of validity of the issuance of a free patent and of the 
title which followed as a matter of course;
[193]
 (13) brush aside the reglementary periods in the filing of an election protest;
[194]
 (14) give due course to or reverse the dismissal of an appeal;
[195]

 or (15) order a refund in a case involving a contract of repurchase of 
real property where there would have been a forfeiture of both land and 
hard-earned money.
[196]
 In all
 of these cases, the undersigned evinces his observations that: (1) the 
grant of a relief based on equity was, in turn, based on some 
specific provision
 of law found on the Civil Code and other laws which allow for the application of equity to some degree (
e.g
.
 Articles 19, 477, 1192, 1229, 1310, 1359, 1362, 1423, 1486, 1520, 1547,
 1601, 1603, 1711, 1722, 1741, 1762, 1794, 1797, 1798, 1819, 1831, 2142,
 2208, 2215 and 2227 of the Civil Code); and (2) the exercise of equity 
jurisdiction was resorted to set aside the rules of procedure in favor 
of resolving cases on the merits or upholding substantive rights.
                    
 In the instant case, the petitioners' 
reliance on equity is misplaced for they are asking this Court to grant 
them a relief not supported by any provision of the Constitution or law.
 While the rules on bail appear to be inflexible on the petitioners' 
part, equity does not authorize courts to create substantive rights by 
way of "adjustment" and in the guise of interpretation. Granting 
provisional liberty to the petitioners may or may not be morally right 
depending on the personal belief of each individual person. However, 
what is "moral," "just," "fair," or "equitable" is highly subjective and
 relative; which is why a reasonable inference (such as the text of a 
law) is needed to minimize subjectivity and strengthen the impartiality 
of presiding magistrates and mitigate instances of grave abuse of 
discretion. As aptly put in 
Rural Bank of ParaÃ±aque, Inc. v. Remolado, et al.
:
[197]




 Justice is done according to law. As a rule, 
equity follows the law. There may be a moral obligation, often regarded 
as an equitable consideration (meaning compassion), but if there is no 
enforceable legal duty, the action must fail although the disadvantaged 
party deserves commiseration or sympathy.




 More importantly, the Court sitting 
en banc
 in 
Republic v. Provincial Government of Palawan
[198]
 had emphatically declared:
                    


 The Court finds the submission untenable. 
Our courts are basically courts of law, 
not
 courts of equity
.
 Furthermore, for all its conceded merits, equity is available only in 
the absence of law and not as its replacement. As explained in the old 
case of 
Tupas v. Court of Appeals
:




 Equity is described as justice outside legality, which simply means that it cannot supplant although it may, as often happens, 
supplement

 the law. We said in an earlier case, and we repeat it now, that all 
abstract arguments based only on equity should yield to positive rules, 
which pre-empt and prevail over such persuasions. 
Emotional appeals 
for justice, while they may wring the heart of the Court, cannot justify
 disregard of the mandate of the law as long as it remains in force
. The applicable maxim, which goes back to the ancient days of the Roman jurists - and is now still reverently observed â is "
aequetas nunquam contravenit legis
." (Emphasis supplied)






 At this juncture, the undersigned deems it the proper time to point out that equity should 
not
 encompass 
all

 matters considered or perceived as "absence" or "gaps" of the law. The 
logic is simple: the areas or subjects beyond or outside the confines of
 written law are infinite in number. Individual cognition of humans 
allows each one to use his or her reasoning faculties differently from 
one another. In effect, it would almost certainly lead each magistrate 
to formulate his or her own version of natural law from the infinite 
area outside of written law. Consequently, if courts are allowed to 
grant reliefs in recognition of substantive rights not expressly 
intended by Congress to be included, judicial legislation would result. 
Specifically, if Articles 9 and 10 of the Civil Code are interpreted to 
give courts an 
unfettered discretion
 in choosing what subjects 
they perceive as "gaps" or "absence" in the law, then "the fundamental 
constitutional principles which underlie our tripartite system of 
government"
[199]
 would be put 
to naught as legislative functions may now be indirectly exercised by a 
branch of government other than Congress. If the constitutional policy 
on the separation of powers is to be respected, the same provisions of 
the Civil Code cannot also be interpreted to allow Congress to impliedly
 delegate its legislative powers to the courts in the guise of 
interpretation. Moreover, disregarding explicit provisions and even 
established precedents on the sole ground of equity creates 
jurisprudential instability because the application of laws and legal 
principles will become unpredictable. Certainly, society would be less 
chaotic if all those governed by our laws would have the ability to 
reasonably predict the consequences of their actions. Adverse sanctions 
which can be reasonably foreseen diminish the exposure to exasperation 
as well as the allure of taking the law into one's own hands.
                    
 As such, 
a resort to 
equity
 is more of an 
exception
 rather than the general rule
. It is not at par with written laws as it is subjective. Textual provisions are 
clear manifestations

 of what Congress intends to include as subjects of legislationâequity 
is, frankly, a mere adjudicative approximation of what such intent 
includes. The wisdom behind limiting equity's application within the 
confines of written law is to prevent magistrates from straying away 
from fairly discernible legislative intent. Such is the reason why 
interpolation is improper where the meaning of the law is clear and 
sensible, either with or without the omitted word or words, because the 
primary source of the legislative intent is in the language of the law 
itself.
[200]
 Moreover, 
emotions used as an attempt to trigger the application of equity are 
unstable and an emotional approach to adjudication often promotes bias, 
thereby slowly eroding a magistrate's impartiality. Hence, for equity to
 be properly applied: (1) it must be suppletory to written law; (2) it 
must not amount to a creation or grant of judicially-enforceable 
substantive rights or obligations; (3) it must, at least, be based on or
 consistent with some specific provision of law in view of the principle
 "that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with 
other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence â 
interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi
;"
[201] 
and (4) it must subject any catch-all provision to the principle of 
ejusdem generis

 "where a general word or phrase follows an enumeration of particular 
and specific words of the same class or where the latter follow the 
former, the general word or phrase is to be construed to include, or to 
be restricted to persons, things or cases akin to, resembling, or of the
 same kind or class as those specifically mentioned."
[202]
 The undersigned's intention here is 
not to strangle equity but to put it in its proper place in the context of statutory law
.
 Therefore, it is apt that the political branches of government be left 
to their devices to pursue adaptive measures while the Judiciary should 
endeavor itself to preserve and foster legal stability.
                    
 
Third
, 
equity is applied only in the absenceâ never in contraventionâ of statutory law
.
[203]
 In this regard, the Recognizance Act
[204]
 provides for the statutory requirements for release on recognizance. Section 5 of the same law states:
                    


 Section 5. 
Release on Recognizance as a Matter of Right Guaranteed by the Constitution
. â 
The
 release on recognizance of any person in custody or detention for the 
commission of an offense is a matter of right when the offense 
is not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment
:
 
Provided
, That the accused or any person on behalf of the accused files the application for such:








(a)


Before 
or after conviction by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial 
Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities and Municipal Circuit Trial 
Court; and






 


 






(b)


Before conviction by the Regional Trial Court: 
Provided, further,

 That a person in custody for a period equal to or more than the minimum
 of the principal penalty prescribed for the offense charged, without 
application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, or any modifying 
circumstance, shall be released on the person's recognizance. (Bold and 
underscoring supplied)










Thus, when the offense is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
, life imprisonment, or death, the accused's release on recognizance is no longer a matter of rightâit becomes discretionary.


 In addition, Section 12 of the Recognizance Act provides:
                    


 Section 12. 
No Release on Recognizance After Final Judgment or Commencement of Sentence; Exception
. â 
The
 benefits provided under this Act shall not be allowed in favor of an 
accused after the judgment has become final or when the accused has 
started serving the sentence:
 
Provided
, That this prohibition
 shall not apply to an accused who is entitled to the benefits of the 
Probation Law if the application for probation is made before the 
convict starts serving the sentence imposed, in which case, the court 
shall allow the release on recognizance of the convict to the custody of
 a qualified member of the barangay, city or municipality where the 
accused actually resides. (Emphasis supplied)




 The afore-cited provision prohibits any release 
on recognizance after a judgment has become final or when the accused 
has started serving his sentence. The only recognized exception pertains
 only to the release of those detainees who are entitled to the benefits
 of the Probation Law; but only if the application for probation is made
 before the convict starts serving the sentence imposed.
                    
 As to the petitioners' prayer for the grant 
of bail, Section 13, Article III of the Constitution is clear that bail 
is not a matter of right in cases where the evidence of guilt is strong 
of those persons charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
. This simply means that a specific constitutional provision exists which 
requires
 a 
prior determination
 that the evidence of guilt is not strong for those accused charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua

 before bail may be granted. Such constitutionally-required prior 
determination cannot be dispensed by reason of equity or exercise of 
equity jurisdiction.
                    
 As aptly explained by Justice Bernabe, our 
Constitution and statutes prescribe a legal framework in granting bail 
or recognizance to persons deprived of liberty pending final conviction.
 When the accused is charged with an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua

 or life imprisonment, the usual procedure is for the accused to apply 
for bail with notice to the prosecutor. Pursuant to the rules, the 
accused may also seek a reduction of the recommended bail amount,
[205]
 or seek a release through recognizance upon satisfaction of the conditions set for by law.
[206]


 Complementing this view, Associate Justice 
Amy C. Lazaro-Javier also opined that it is not necessary to invoke 
equity or humanitarianism so courts could have the needed flexibility to
 do justice in a particular case under specifically unique 
circumstances, or to be able to rely upon broad moral principles of 
reasonableness, fair dealing and good conscience in resolving issues.
                    
 In essence, the existence of the 
constitutional provisions on bail as well as the Recognizance Act 
evidently militates against the resort to equity.
                    
 
Fourth
, the Court's ruling in 
Enrile v. Sandiganbayan, et al.
[207] 
is inapplicable in the instant case.
                    
 The grant or denial of bail applications contemplates three (4) scenarios:
                    






(1)


Bail is 
granted as a matter of right before or after conviction of the accused 
by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial 
Court in Cities or Municipal Circuit Trial Court.
[208]






 


 






(2)


Bail is granted as a 
matter of right before conviction of the accused by the Regional Trial 
Court for an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment.
[209]






 


 






(3)


Bail is discretionary
 on the part of the Regional Trial Court upon conviction of the accused 
of an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
 or life
 imprisonment; or on the part of the appellate courts (Court of 
Appeals, Sandiganbayan and Court of Tax Appeals) if the records had 
already been transmitted to them or if the nature of the offense was 
downgraded by the trial court upon conviction from non-bailable to 
bailable.
[210]






 


 






(4)


Bail shall be denied 
or cancelled if the penalty imposed by the trial court is imprisonment 
exceeding six (6) year due to the following or similar circumstances: 
(a) that the accused is a recidivist, quasi-recidivist, or habitual 
delinquent, or has committed the crime aggravated by the circumstance of
 reiteration;(b) that the accused has previously escaped from legal 
confinement, evaded sentence, or violated the conditions of his or her 
bail without valid justification; (c) that the accused committed the 
offense while under probation, parole, or conditional pardon; (d) that 
the circumstances of the accused's case indicate the probability of 
flight if released on bail; or (e) that there is undue risk that he may 
commit another crime during the pendency of the appeal.
[211]






 


 






(5)


Bail shall not be admitted if an accused is charged with a capital offense or an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment when evidence of guilt is strong regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution.
[212]








In situations where bail is discretionary, the 
judge who either issues a warrant of arrest or grants a bail application
 while fixing a reasonably amount is duty-bound to primarily consider 
the following factors which are not limited to the previously mentioned 
factors in Section 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal 
Procedure. In other words, a bail hearing is an indispensable 
requirement; especially when the accused is charged with an offense 
punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
, life imprisonment, or death.
[213]


 In 
Enrile
, the Court emphasized 
that while the Philippines honors its "commitment to uphold the 
fundamental human rights as well as value the worth and dignity of every
 person," the grant of bail to those charged in criminal proceedings as 
well as extraditees must be based upon a 
clear and convincing showing
: (a) 
that the detainee will 
not
 be a 
flight risk
 or a 
danger
 to the 
community
; 
and
 (b) 
that there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances
. Under the rules on syntax, the conjunctive word "and" denotes a "joinder or union" of words, phrases or clause.
[214]

 This means that "special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances" as
 a ground for granting bail does work in isolationâit has to be 
accompanied
 by 
other

 considerations. Moreover, the same ruling also emphasized that the 
"principal purpose of bail... is to guarantee the appearance of the 
accused at the trial, or whenever so required by the court." Meaning, 
when this Court reviewed the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan which
 were exposed during the bail hearings, 
all
 relevant circumstances were first 
balanced

 on the scales of justice before a ruling was handed downâbail was not 
automatically granted as a matter of right due to humanitarian reasons; 
but as a matter of discretion due to other accompanying factors. 
Besides, as asserted by Chief Justice Peralta, the 
Enrile
 Ruling cannot be considered as 
pro hac vice
âa Latin term meaning "for this one particular occasion"âcannot be relied upon as a precedent to govern other cases
[215]
 because such type of ruling violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
[216]


 Here, the petitioners do not deny the allegations of the OSG that they are indeed charged with heinous crimes related to 
national security

 and are also valuable members of the CPP-NPA-NDF and its affiliates. 
Even if the alleged facts underlying humanitarian reasons were to be 
accepted without question, they 
still have to be weighed
 against the fact that 
the charges against the petitioners 
involve serious matters of national security and public safety
.
 In the petitioners' case, one need not stretch his or her imagination 
in contemplating a situation where a person of deteriorating health, for
 instance, can still commit crimes such as conspiracy to commit 
rebellion or can become an accomplice or accessory to the commission of 
rebellion. In the age of modern technology where the use of cellular 
phones is rampant and access to the internet is relatively effortless, a
 strong possibility looms that the petitioners may still possess the 
necessary ability to strategize hostile measures against the government 
or give aid to their active comrades by providing intelligence reports 
in their surroundings. Even if the Court were to ignore the concern of 
the possibility that some petitioners may be flight risks, the 
possibility of endangering the community is not remote. Such is the 
reason why this Court in 
VillaseÃ±or v. Abano, et al.
[217]
 enunciated that 
both
 "the good of the public as well as the rights of the accused" and "the 
need for a tie to the jurisdiction and the right to freedom from 
unnecessary restraint before conviction under the circumstances 
surrounding each particular accused" should all be 
balanced
 in one equation
.
 As a consequence, the petitioners' reliance on this ruling is patently 
misguided. In the case of former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, there was 
showing that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.
                    
 
Fifth
, the grant or denial of 
bail applications is within the jurisdiction of the trial courts 
well-equipped to handle questions of fact.
                    
 The Rules of Criminal Procedure 
requires a hearing
 before resolving a motion for bail by persons charged with offenses punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 where the prosecution may discharge its burden of showing that the evidence of guilt is strong.
[218]
 This hearing, whether summary or otherwise,
[219]
 is mandatory and indispensable.
[220]

 Connectedly, a "summary hearing" means such brief and speedy method of 
receiving and considering the evidence of guilt as is practicable and 
consistent with the purpose of the hearing which is merely to determine 
the weight of the evidence for the purpose of bail.
[221]
 If a party is denied the opportunity to be heard, there would be a violation of procedural due process.
[222]

 Thus, in applications for bail, courts are duty-bound to: (a) notify 
the prosecutor of the hearing of the application for bail or require him
 to submit his recommendation; (b) conduct a hearing of the application 
for bail regardless of whether or not the prosecution refuses to present
 evidence to show that the guilt of the accused is strong for the 
purpose of enabling the court to exercise its sound discretion; (c) 
decide whether the evidence of guilt of the accused is strong based on 
the summary of evidence of the prosecution; and (d) if the guilt of the 
accused is not strong, discharge the accused upon the approval of the 
bail bondâotherwise; bail should be denied.
[223]

 Therefore, regardless of the trial court's disposition in applications 
for bail, the order should not be tainted with grave abuse of discretion
 and should give all parties an opportunity to present their respective 
pieces of evidence to support their causes or defenses.
[224]

 As elucidated by Justice Bernabe, the Court would be betraying its 
mandate to apply the law and the Constitution should it prematurely 
order the release of petitioners on bail or recognizance absent the 
requisite hearing to determine whether or not the evidence of guilt 
against them is strong.
                    
 Relatedly, it is a settled rule that this Court is not a trier of facts.
[225]

 With respect to a direct invocation of this Court's original 
jurisdiction writs, the same shall not be allowed unless the redress 
desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts.
[226]

 The rationale for this rule is two-fold: (a) it would be an imposition 
upon the precious time of this Court; and (b) it would cause an 
inevitable and resultant delay, intended or otherwise, in the 
adjudication of cases, which in some instances had to be remanded or 
referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of 
procedure, or as better equipped to resolve the issues because this 
Court is not a trier of facts.
[227]

 Like Justice Bernabe, Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul B. Inting also 
shares the view that the Court cannot prematurely order the petitioners'
 release, either on bail or recognizance, without the mandatory bail 
hearing for the determination of the strength of the prosecution's cases
 against them because it is not equipped to receive evidence and make 
separate factual assessments for each petitioner in order to determine 
his or her entitlement to bail.
                    
 Here, the petitioners pray for their release
 on recognizance or bail and for the creation of a "Prisoner Release 
Committee" which strongly indicates that theirs is a petition for bail 
or recognizance filed directly before this Court. This cannot be done 
because, as previously pointed out, the factors enumerated in Sections 5
 and 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure are purely 
factual in nature. To determine whether evidence of guilt of the accused 
is strong, the conduct of bail hearings is required where the 
prosecution has the burden of proof, subject to the right of the defense
 to cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence in rebuttal.
[228]

 Only after weighing the pieces of evidence as contained in the summary 
will the judge formulate his or her own conclusion as to whether the 
evidence of guilt against the accused is strong based on his discretion.
[229]


 Besides, the principle espoused in 
Enrile

 cannot be applied in the instant case for the purpose of entertaining 
the present petition because, in the case of former Senator Juan Ponce 
Enrile, a bail hearing was indeed conducted by the Sandiganbayan. The 
same cannot be said of the petitioners who, whether deliberate or not, 
failed to provide enough data or information in their petition involving
 the following matters: (a) specific charges, nature of their crimes and
 corresponding penalties; (b) stages of trial or proceedings; (c) 
specific dates and lengths of detention; (d) any motion filed before the
 trial courts for provisional release and; (e) present results of 
physical examinations on their status of health relating to COVID-19. 
For this reason, the Court has no way of assessing whether or not the 
evidence of guilt as to the petitioners is strong. As observed by both 
Justice Bernabe and Justice Caguioa, the petitioners have not shown that
 any of them have filed the necessary bail applications. It was also not
 shown by the petitioners that bail hearings were conducted in their 
respective cases in order to determine whether or not there exists 
strong evidence of guilt, which would, in turn, determine their 
qualification or disqualification for the reliefs prayed for. As Justice
 Zalameda bluntly puts, the petitioners are seeking to carve out for 
themselves a special circumstance that is not present in our established
 rules but failed in their duty to present the reasons why the general 
rule is not applicable to them; in effect, they want this Court to turn a
 blind eye to the established rules which take into account the nature 
and gravity of the crimes committed, as well as the number of years 
served.
                    
 Even assuming for the sake of argument that 
the petitioners had managed to attach documents proving the foregoing 
pieces of information, the determination of whether or not guilt is 
strong should still be lodged with the trial courts who are 
well-equipped to handle them. As precisely declared by Justice Caguioa, 
the want of necessary factual details brought about by a proper bail 
hearing precludes this Court from a full calibration of each 
petitioner's eligibility for either release on bail or recognizance.
                    
 Incidentally, since the petitioners failed 
to provide the data as to whether they have previously applied for bail,
 the Court is also not in the proper position to direct all the trial 
courts where each of the petitioners' respective cases are pending to 
conduct bail proceedings or expedite unresolved bail applications. To do
 so would constitute an implied nullification of previously concluded 
bail proceedings in which some of the respective trial courts may have 
found strong evidence of guilt against some of the petitioners. This 
would result in a re-hearing or duplication of otherwise concluded 
proceedings. As such, the same petition 
should have been individually and separately filed before the respective 
trial courts
 where each the petitioners' cases are currently pending
.
 Otherwise, this Court will be flooded with a deluge of bail 
applications seeking for a factual evaluation of every petitioner's 
unique circumstances. 
                    
Sixth
, the respondents have adequately shown that they have already undertaken efforts to address the COVID-19 concern.
                    
 Judicial notice is the cognizance of certain
 facts that judges may properly take and act on without proof because 
these facts are already known to them.
[230]
 Put differently, it is the assumption by a court of a fact without need of further traditional evidentiary support.
[231]

 The principle is based on convenience and expediency in securing and 
introducing evidence on matters that are not ordinarily capable of 
dispute and are not bona fide disputed.
[232]


 Here, the Court can take judicial notice of 
the fact that COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person via 
droplets, contact, and fomites. It is transmitted when one individual 
talks, sneezes, or coughs producing 'droplets' of saliva containing the 
COVID-19 virus.
[233]
 These 
droplets are then inhaled by another person. COVID-19 transmission 
usually occurs among close contacts. It is therefore important to 
maintain a distance of more than one meter away from any person who has 
respiratory symptoms.
[234]
 
Likewise, it has been conveyed to the general public that there are 
population groups who have a higher risk of developing sever COVID-19 
infections such as individuals aged 60 and above, pregnant, and those 
with underlying conditions or co-morbidity at risk of COVID-19 
exacerbation.
[235]
 This 
information is of public knowledge as has been imparted not only by 
international COVID-19 experts through different information media but 
also through the official acts of the executive department, through the 
issuances and advisories of the Department of Health and the country's 
Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). As 
such, mandatory and discretionary judicial notice can be taken on this 
fact.
                    
 On a related note, the OSG in its Comment 
stated the specific precautions used by the Bureau of Corrections and 
the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) to control the spread 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and attached as an annex the April 21, 2020 
BJMP Verified Report

In its Verified Report, the BJMP stated that it 
was adopting the following specific measures to prevent the spread of 
COVID-19 in detention facilities, to wit: (a) the suspension of inmate 
visitation as early as March 11, 2020; (b) continuous conduct of 
information dissemination on precautionary measures against COVID-19; 
(c) provision of facemasks and mandatory wearing of such among persons 
deprived of liberty (PDLs); (d) social distancing among PDLs; (e) 
regular exercise of PDLs to boost their immune system; (f) distribution 
of vitamins among PDLs; (g) medicines and special diets given to PDLs 
who have pre-existing medical conditions; (h) rigid disinfection of 
supplies and deliveries inside prison' cells; (i) regular sanitation and
 disinfection of the whole jail perimeter including jail buildings and 
jail cells; (j) improvised foot bath to prevent virus to be carried 
inside jail cells and; (k) special monitoring for PDLs with pre-existing
 conditions.


 In case where PDLs become infected or show 
symptoms of COVID-19, the BJMP undertakes in its Verified Report to 
pursue the following safety measures: (a) immediate isolation of PDL 
with COVID-19 symptoms; (b) assessment by the jail nurse on the patient;
 (c) if associated with COVID-19, the jail officials refer the patient 
to the Department of Health (DOH) in accordance with the DOH referral 
procedure; (d) immediate conduct of contact tracing to monitor the 
extent of inmate exposure; and (e) the jail official also informs the 
inmate's family of the status and health condition of the inmate who is 
infected. Moreover, the BJMP Verified Report also states that there are 
already established isolation rooms equipped with medical equipment and 
supplies in case of inmate infection among PDLs. The jail infirmary also
 operates twenty-four (24) hours a day.
[237]


 Meanwhile, the April 22, 2020 Bureau of Corrections Verified Report
[238]
 submitted along with the OSG's Comment provides for the following information:

(4)


Compendium of Policies and Interim Guidelines on COVID-19 Management.








The Bureau of Corrections' Verified Report 
contains specific measures adopted throughout correctional facilities in
 the country, to wit: (1) general information drive about COVID-19; (2) 
no contact policy between inmates; (3) strict fourteen (14) days 
quarantine for newly committed PDLs; (4) proliferation and creation of 
isolation facilities to accommodate future COVID-19 patients; (5) no 
face mask, no entry policy; (6) the immediate deployment of manpower for
 the construction and renovation of facilities of PDLs and; (7) strict 
monitoring of ingress and egress of health personnel across jail 
buildings.
[239]


 Indeed, the whole nation is under unprecedented 
times with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The threat of infection 
of COVID-19 reaches everyone even Filipinos outside prison jails. 
Although inmates of prison jails are at high risk of infection, the 
Bureau of Corrections and the BJMP have been steadfastly containing the 
spread of the pandemic inside jails throughout the country. Based on the
 records available to this Court, it appears that both bureaus have 
enforced proper social distancing and are safeguarding PDLs with special
 health conditions or high-risk inmates. Moreover, both bureaus also 
have in place isolation methods to secure PDLs in the unfortunate event 
an inmate becomes infected with COVID-19. As observed by Chief Justice 
Peralta, the Bureau of Corrections even put in place the necessary 
infrastructure to provide inmates a facility for online visits/video 
conference with their relatives. In light of these developments, the 
Filipino people including PDLs throughout the country should be secure 
in their thoughts that both bureaus are presumably performing their 
duties in properly handling the spread of the COVID-19 virus in 
detention facilities despite budgetary constraints. 
                    
 
Seventh
, the petitioners have ample remedies under existing laws and Supreme Court issuances. 
                    
 Notably, the Court is certainly attuned to 
the extreme needs of decongesting detention facilities to promote social
 distancing during this critical time. Initially, this Court thru the 
Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ) had already taken the initiative of 
issuing the following Administrative Circulars to address the problem of
 jail congestion in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, to wit: (a) 
Administrative Circular No. 38-2020; (b) Administrative Circular No. 
37-2020; (c) Administrative Circular No. 33-2020. Likewise, the Office 
of the Court Administrator (OCA) also issued the following circulars: 
(a) OCA Circular No. 93-2020; (b) OCA Circular No. 91-2020; and (c) OCA 
Circular No. 89-2020âto implement the OCJ's administrative circulars. 
Both the OCJ and the OCA's circulars are intended to expedite the 
process of resolving bail applications currently pending especially 
those of indigents as well as providing guidelines for videoconferencing
 and electronic filing. All that the petitioners have to do is avail of 
the benefits under these issuances which are more than adequate to 
address their concerns on the COVID-19 pandemicâunless they are not so 
qualified or they failed to post the required bail amount, then they 
have to remain in detention and undergo trial to prove their innocence. 
                    
 To date, the following issuances have been 
promulgated to directly and indirectly facilitate the proceedings 
involving the possible release of PDLs:

 Clearly, the foregoing data shows that this 
Court's issuances thru the OCJ have made a significant impact in 
decongesting jails and other detention facilities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, ample judicial remedies are available to the 
petitioners and other similarly-situated PDLs who seek provisional 
liberty. Likewise, administrative remedies for PDLs who are currently 
serving their sentences like petitioner Lilia Bucatcat are also 
available to them. As pointed out by both Chief Justice Peralta and 
Justice Zalameda, such administrative actions present an 
incontrovertible proof that institutions of the justice system other 
than the Judiciary are indeed enacting measures to decongest our 
detention and penal facilities in order to mitigate the possible spread 
of COVID-19. As such, the petitioners have no valid reason to insist 
that they have no other judicial or administrative remedy save for a 
direct recourse to this Court.


 Besides, release on bail or recognizance is not 
the only way to decongest jails. This Court, thru former Chief Justices 
Hilario G. Davide, Jr. and Reynato S. Puno, had previously promulgated 
Administrative Circular Nos. 12-2000
[248]
 and 08-2008
[249]

 which gave the trial courts the option to impose the penalty of fine 
with subsidiary imprisonment instead of imprisonment itself. This is 
also supplemented by the enactment of Republic Act No. 11362
[250]
 (Community Service Act) which authorized courts to require community service 
in lieu
 of jail service for offenses punishable by 
arresto menor
 and 
arresto mayor
.
[251]

 To claim that releasing prisoners on bail or recognizance is the only 
way to decongest jails is to ignore Congress and this Court's previous 
decongestion efforts that have already been put in place for trial 
courts to apply either in deciding the case or upon motion of the 
parties.
                    
 
Last
, Philippine 
constitutional and statutory provisions remain in force despite the 
ongoing pandemic as well as the international calls for the release of 
prisoners.
                    
 As Chief Justice Peralta puts it, neither 
the pandemic nor the executive declaration of a Luzon-wide lockdown has 
the effect of suspending our laws and rules, much less of shutting down 
the Judiciary. In support of this finding, Justice Zalameda quoted 
Justice Leonen's ponencia in 
Abogado, et al. v. Department of Environment and Natural Resources, et al.
[252]

 wherein the latter clearly enunciated that "[t]he imminence or 
emergency of an ecological disaster should not be an excuse for 
litigants to do away with their responsibility of substantiating their 
petitions before the courts." This is also supplemented by Associate 
Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr.'s (Justice Reyes) opinion that the Philippine
 government is not expected to simply conform to the manner of releasing
 prisoners being adopted by other countries because such release is 
qualified by certain conditions. As pointed out by Chief Justice 
Peralta, the initiatives of other countries in decongesting prison 
facilities were based on laws and rules prevailing in those 
jurisdictionsâ the Philippines did not lag behind in this respect. 
Therefore, 
if the true ideals of independence are to be valued at 
all, supranational entities and foreign sovereigns should not be allowed
 to 
dictate
 how the Philippines should conduct or handle its 
internal affairs; especially when it comes to protecting the lives, 
health and safety of its citizens.






On the 
prerogative to choose appropriate strategies and the proper judicial 
approach when general welfare concerns clash with civil liberties in 
times of emergency
:






Political questions refer to those which are to 
be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to 
which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the Legislature
 or executive branch of the government.
[253]

 These questions are concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom, 
not the legality, of a particular act or measure being assailed in which
 this Court will not normally interfere unless the case shows a clear 
need for it to step in to uphold the law and the Constitution.
[254]

 Recourse to the political question doctrine necessarily raises the 
underlying doctrine of separation of powers among the three great 
branches of government that the Constitution has entrenched.
[255]


 In relation to the political questions 
doctrine, police power is the power of the state to promote public 
welfare by restraining and regulating the use of liberty and property;
[256]
 although it also extends to providing for all public needs as 
parens patriae
.
[257]

 It has been established by jurisprudence that police power finds no 
specific Constitutional grant for the plain reason that it does not owe 
its origin to the Charter since it is inborn in the very fact of 
statehood and sovereignty.
[258]

 However, no less than the Constitution declares that "[t]he maintenance
 of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and 
promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all 
the people of the blessings of democracy."
[259]

 Such seemingly redundant constitutional declaration only serves to 
buttress the State's inherent prerogative "to prescribe regulations to 
promote the health, morals, education, good order or safety, and general
 welfare of the people [as it] flows from the recognition that 
salus populi est suprema lex
â the welfare of the people is the supreme law."
[260]


 Concomitantly, the power to promote the 
health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety and general 
welfare of the people by making statutes or ordinances is 
vested in the legislature
.
[261]

 The most obvious manifestation of such power are penal statutes in 
which the State defines and punishes crimes as well as lays down the 
corresponding criminal rules of procedure.
[262]

 Also, related to the enactment of penal statutes as an implement of 
police power, it is necessary either for the State agents to have 
"custody of the law" in bail applications or for the courts to acquire 
"jurisdiction over the person" of the accused
[263]
â
 the purpose of which is for the accused "to have a speedy, impartial, 
and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have 
compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the 
production of evidence in his behalf."
[264]

 In other words, the State's act of detaining a person charged with a 
crime even when his or her guilt is still to be proven by the 
prosecution is not without pragmatic and underlying wisdom. Deprivation 
of liberty, especially if evidence of guilt is strong or no bail was 
posted, in such instance ensures that: (a) the court will have 
jurisdiction over the person of the accused, as earlier stated, in order
 to render a binding judgment; (b) the state agents will be assured of 
having the ability to bring the accused to participate in necessary 
proceedings as required by the court; and (c) the accused will be 
prevented from committing another crime which endangers society or from 
undertaking further acts to conceal the crime being charged against him 
or her. Verily, it is reasonable to assume that police power which 
includes keeping persons accused of a crime in custody is not subject to
 a reasonable debate.
                    
 In the case of the petitioners' continued 
confinement in their respective detention facilities, the Court cannot 
issue an order for the creation of a "Prisoner Release Committee" in the
 absence of any law and in the absence of any concluded bail hearing 
which resulted in the grant of provisional liberty. As it stands, only 
the political branches of government (Executive and Legislative) have 
the power to determine for themselves if such recourse is warranted. The
 only act that the Court may do under the circumstances is to order the 
conduct of bail hearings before the trial courts with dispatch. Besides,
 it must be emphasized in the first place, that the legislature, which 
is the constitutional 
repository of police power
 and exercises the prerogative of determining the policy of the State, is by force of circumstances 
primarily the judge of necessity, adequacy
 or 
reasonableness
 and wisdom, of any law promulgated in the 
exercise
 of the police power, or of the 
measures adopted to implement the public policy
 or to 
achieve public interest
.
[265]
 In instances, the President may exercise police power to a limited extent only for the purpose of securing public safety.
[266]
 Thus, it is the elected representatives of the People who should determine "the greatest good for the greatest number"
[267]
 in times of national emergencies.
                    
 Besides, whenever a conundrum arises 
in times of emergency

 when police power collides with constitutionally-protected freedoms or 
fundamental rights, the political question doctrine will often tip the 
balance in favor of general welfare acts or policies in view of the 
State's duty to primarily protect general interests. Such rule of 
interpretation is consistent with the basic principle instilled in 
Marcos, et al. v. Manglapus, et al.
[268]
 articulating that: "[i]t must be borne in mind that the Constitution, aside from being an allocation of power[,] 
is also a 
social contract
 whereby the people have 
surrendered
 their 
sovereign powers
 to the State 
for
 the 
common good
.â 
However
,
 while public safety is the paramount and overriding concern of the 
State and, while it is also true that laws should be interpreted in 
favor of the greatest good of the greatest number during emergencies, 
individual freedoms also have to be respected
.
 As Justice Reyes describes, such duty entails the complex task of 
harmonizing fundamental interests of every individual, both free and 
deprived of liberty, and the general public and, while certain 
individual's plea for the application of the "humanity of law" may be 
considered in exceptional circumstances, public protection is equally 
paramount and thus, can never be discounted. Thus, in upholding police 
power measures over constitutional freedoms in 
times of emergency
,
 the Court should subject any encroachment of either constitutional or 
statutory rights to the following interpretational parameters:
                    






(1)


Such encroachment shall be incidental to public safety and shall not enter the bounds of arbitrariness; 






 


 






(2)


Measures pursued or 
concerns protected by the State should be reasonably related or linked 
to the attainment of its legitimate objectives consistent with general 
welfare; and






 


 






(3)


The measure undertaken or concern addressed for the benefit of the majority pursuant to an exercise of police power must not be 
unnecessarily
 oppressive on the minority.








The current choice of the State to continually detain the petitioners satisfies the aforementioned criteria for these reasons:


 
First
, the State's exercise of its
 prerogative to elect appropriate strategies under the present public 
health emergency situation branches have ample basis. 
                    
 "Public safety" involves the prevention of 
and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general
 public from significant danger, injury/harm, or damage, such as crimes 
or disastersâ it is an abstract term with no physical form with a 
boundless range, extent or scope.
[269]


 In the case at hand, there is wisdom in the 
continued detention of the petitioners as the nature of their respective
 charges is serious enough to justify their continued detention 
until

 bail hearings have been conducted and their applications have been 
acted upon favorably. Viewed in the context of the Executive 
department's vantage point, the release of the petitioners endangers 
national security. It can be reasonably inferred under the circumstances
 that the Executive department has already made up its mind that the 
last thing they need in the fight against COVID-19 is to face the 
hostilities of armed rebel groups. As it is there are reports of 
COVID-19 cases already permeating in jails; there are also reports that 
rebel groups have launched armed attacks against the military and the 
police who are engaged in their duties of distributing relief goods and 
manning the check points. At this point, the most prudent course of 
action that the Court may do is to defer to the political branches as 
regards the matter of selecting the most appropriate strategy to 
maintain public order and preserve public safety. As Justice Zalameda 
opines, there has to be a balance between the State's duty to protect 
the specific victims of the crime as well as the general public, and the
 petitioners' rights under international law.
                    
 
Second
, the State's measure of
 continually detaining the petitioners is reasonably related to its 
objective of maintaining public order and preserving public safety. 
While there is still no judicially declared terrorist organization in 
our jurisdiction pursuant to Section 17
[270]
 of R.A. No. 9372
[271]
 to date,
[272]
 the US and the European Union have both classified the CPP, NPA and 
Abu Sayyaf
 Group as foreign terrorist organizations.
[273]

 Obviously, this is a legitimate and vital concern to national security.
 As earlier discussed, the government cannot afford to gamble its 
chances and resources by allowing the petitioners who are allegedly key 
members of the CPP-NPA-NDF to roam free while the COVID-19 pandemic 
remains an imminent and grave threat. During this time, the government 
cannot afford to lose its front-liners in its battle against the 
pandemic. The last thing that this Court should do 
in times of nationwide public health emergency

 is to tip the scales of justice against public safety and against 
national security interests. This realization alone adequately 
supports the reasonable link or relation
 between the petitioners' continued detention and the objective of suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    
 However, such pronouncement 
is merely for the 
very limited purpose
 of determining whether or not there is a reasonable link or relation
 between the assailed government measures or concerns and the legitimate objectives regarding general welfare 
in times of emergency
. Admittedly, the undersigned cannot, in good conscience, naively ignore age-old and popular 
allegations
 that the CPP-NPA-NDF is a terrorist organization. But as part of due process, 
the undersigned 
cannot also preempt
 at this time 
any finding
 that the authorizing division of the Court of Appeals may encounter in the future
 should the DOJ file an application under the newly-enacted Section 26 of R.A. No. 11479
[274]

 (formerly Section 17 of R.A. No. 9372 which used to lodge proscription 
proceedings before the Regional Trial Court) to have the CPP-NPA-NDF 
declared "as a terrorist and outlawed group of persons, organization, or
 association." In essence, the DOJ 
still has to prove
 in 
such proscription proceedings that the CPP-NPA-NDF was and is indeed 
engaged in acts constitutive of terrorism. As voiced out by Justice 
Reyes, the Court should refrain at this time from making such 
pronouncements that goes into the merits of petitioners' pending cases.
                    
 
Last
, the petitioners' continued detention cannot be considered as an unnecessarily oppressive act of the State.
                    
 Oppression has been defined as "an act of cruelty, severity, unlawful exaction, domination or excessive use of authority."
[275]
 Since the petitioners are allegedly members of the CPP-NPA-NDF, their continued detention is still deemed 
necessary

 until and unless they prove during the bail hearing that the evidence 
of their supposed guilt is not strong. Such unavoidable restraint of 
liberty is not "unnecessarily oppressive" as the petitioners have not 
shown that the State had been indifferent to their clinical needs. The 
medical certificates attached by the petitioners as annexes adequately 
prove that the Bureau of Corrections and the BJMP had not been remiss in
 their duties of assisting inmates in undergoing the required medical 
checkups. Had the opposite been the case, the petitioners would have 
been left to their own devices to deal with their own vulnerable health.
 Allowing the petitioners to undergo medical checkups with the necessary
 assistance from State agents negates the presence of "excessive use of 
authority," "cruelty" or "domination." Under the extant circumstances, 
the State cannot be reasonably considered by the Court as having acted 
cruelly in continually denying the petitioners of their liberty in the 
midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    
 
Treatment of the Petition


 In a nutshell, the petitioners' prayers in 
seeking for the release on recognizance or bail and for the creation of a
 "Prisoner Release Committee" (along with the issuance of ground rules 
for eligible prisoners) indicate that theirs is a petition for bail or 
recognizance filed directly before this Court. As explained in detail 
earlier in the discussions, not one of these prayers may be granted for 
the following reasons: 
                    






(1)


The grant
 or denial of bail application requires a hearing and an evaluation of 
proven facts which are functions of trial courts; 






 


 






(2)


This Court's time and resources will be better utilized by resolving cases within the scope of its exclusive jurisdiction; 






 


 






(3)


The petitioners 
failed to provide any data

 or attachment pertaining to their bail applications filed, if any, with
 the respective trial courts handling their cases for this Court to 
evaluate;






 


 






(4)


The petitioners are 
not without any remedy
 to seek for provisional liberty before the proper forum if they so choose;






 


 






(5)


This Court had already issued several guidelines to facilitate the proceedings involving the possible release of PDLs; and






 


 






(6)


The creation of a "Prisoner Release Committee" has no clear constitutional and statutory basis.








Although the Court may, in some instances, refer 
bail or recognizance applications filed before it to the trial courts, 
it is not feasible to do so in this case because: (a) some of the 
petitioners may have already filed their bail or recognizance 
applications before the respective trial courts handling their cases; 
(b) re-opening bail or recognizance applications may unnecessarily 
prolong the criminal proceedings if evidence of guilt adduced by the 
prosecution had already been adjudged by the respective trial courts as 
strong; (c) bail or recognizance application is an absolute prerogative 
or option of a detained accused; and (d) guidelines for the possible 
release of PDLs have been put in place. Under the circumstances, the 
most prudent course of action is to let the petitioners pursue their 
bail or recognizance applications before the 
proper forum
.
 After all, this Court had already promulgated several issuances to 
facilitate the possible release of PDLsâall that the petitioners have to
 do is to abide by these guidelines.


 At this point, it is wise to impart Chief 
Justice Peralta's conclusion that the petitioners are probably seeking 
administrativeânot judicialâremedies that would genuinely address their 
concerns in regard to which this Court, as overseer of the Judiciary, 
could exercise no other prerogative than 
to direct the trial courts concerned to resolve the underlying criminal cases with deliberate dispatch
.
 That judicial remedy is unavailable to the reliefs prayed for, is all 
the more apparent from their collective sentiment that the 
government-imposed quarantine and lockdown measures, which in the 
interim necessarily denied them of supervised access to their families 
and friends, have negatively affected their mental well-being. As the 
petitioners complain about languishing in isolation, they fail to see 
that in truth, the rest of the outside world is likewise socially 
isolating as a basic precautionary measure in response to a pandemic of 
this kind. They lament the lingering fear of a potential infection 
within their confinement on account of their respective physical 
vulnerabilities and hereby plead that they be indefinitely set free, 
without realizing that it is the same exact fear which looms outside of 
prison walls.
                    
 
Conclusion


 The world is currently facing a battle that 
harbors the potential to be one of the deadliest in history. The enemy 
cannot be seen and its workings cannot, as of yet, be understood even by
 the most brilliant of minds in the scientific community. Faced with a 
monumental task of balancing all governmental efforts of curbing a 
formidable enemy for the benefit of the general population against some 
sensible but conjectural fears that the health of some inmates or 
detainees might be neglected by authorities, it is prudent to interpret 
the Constitution and the law in a manner which places public safety as 
the pinnacle of all concerns for "[s]elf-preservation is the first law 
of nature"
[276]
 and "the fundamental and paramount objective of the [S]tate [is to bring] about the greatest good to the greatest number.'"
[277]

 However, as a matter of duty, such interpretation is of course subject 
to strict libertarian safeguards. While the undersigned sympathizes with
 the petitioners' miserable plight, it simply cannot act in a manner 
violative of the fundamental law. The remedy simply lies with the 
political branches to pursue. As lucidly explained in 
Vera, et al. v. Avelino, et al.
[278]
 by Associate Justice (later Chief Justice) Cesar Bengzon:
                    


 Let us not be overly influenced by the plea 
that for every wrong there is a remedy, and that the judiciary should 
stand ready to afford relief. There are undoubtedly many wrongs the 
judicature may not correct, for instance, those involving political 
questions. x x x


 Let us likewise disabuse our minds from the 
notion that the judiciary is the repository of remedies for all 
political or social ills. We should not forget that the Constitution has
 judiciously allocated the powers of government to three distinct and 
separate compartments; and that judicial interpretation has tended to 
the preservation of the independence of the three, and a zealous regard 
of the prerogatives of each, knowing full well that one is not the 
guardian of the others and that, for official wrong-doing, each may be 
brought to account, either by impeachment, trial or by the ballot box.




 Despite Associate Justice Gregorio Perfecto's 
livid and scathing dissent that the afore-cited ratiocination "is 
irrelevant" because the Court at that time was supposedly "dealing with a
 constitutional wrong which, under the fundamental law, can and must be 
redressed by the [J]udiciary,"
[279]

 the reliefs prayed for by the petitioners are 
constitutionally-impossible to grant because it involves "engrafting 
upon a law something that has been omitted which someone believes ought 
to have been embraced"
[280]
âa 
clear act of judicial legislation. The petitioners and the public have 
to understand that, as guardian of the Constitution, this Court cannot 
break its sworn duty to uphold the fundamental law. Succinctly, the 
Court is not constitutionally-empowered to perform acts contrary to the 
principle of separation of powers no matter how lofty the underlying 
intentions may be.
                    
 Besides, impartiality demands that this 
Court should exercise an even-handed temperament in balancing the 
conflicting interests embodied in both the general welfare clause and 
the constitutionally-protected fundamental rights. An emotional approach
 to an extraordinarily tense situation betrays the objective resolution 
of highly-controversial disputes. Therefore, the undersigned is of the 
view that it is not what this Court is 
willing
 to doâbut what it 
can
 doâunder the circumstances which determines the fate of the present petition.
                    
 
WHEREFORE
, the undersigned votes to 
DENY 
the instant petition for lack of merit and for improperly invoking the Court's original jurisdiction.

 Nothing is better settled than that the Philippines being independent 
and sovereign, its authority may be exercised over its entire 
domain. There is no portion thereof that is beyond its power. Within its 
limits, its decrees are supreme, its commands paramount. Its laws govern 
therein, and everyone to whom it applies must submit to its terms. That 
is the extent of its jurisdiction, both territorial and personal. 
Necessarily, likewise, it has to be exclusive. If it were not thus, 
there is a diminution of its sovereignty (
Reagan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
 G.R. No. L-26379, December 27, 1969, 141 Phil, 621, 625). In the final 
analysis, this Court already had the opportunity to clarify that "[t]he 
fact that international law has been made part of the law of the land 
does 
not
 pertain to or imply the 
primacy
 of international law over national or municipal law in the municipal sphere
. The
 doctrine of incorporation, as applied in most countries, decrees that 
rules of international law are given equal standing with, but are not 
superior to, national legislative enactments. xxx 
In states where the constitution is the highest law of the land
, such as the Republic of the Philippines, 
both statutes and treaties may be invalidated if they are in conflict with the Constitution
 (

cannot be reasonably interpreted to automatically alter or deactivate 
other provisions of the Constitution without passing through the 
sanctioned process of amendment or revision outlined in Article XVII.

 Current data suggest person-to-person transmission most commonly 
happens during close exposure to a person infected with the virus that 
causes COVID-19, primarily via respiratory droplets produced when the 
infected person speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Droplets can land in the 
mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled 
into the lungs of those within close proximity. Transmission also might 
occur through contact with contaminated surfaces followed by 
self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth. The contribution of small 
respirable particles, sometimes called aerosols or droplet nuclei, to 
close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. However, airborne 
transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely

 The Court explicitly assured that court hearings on urgent mattersâincluding that of "

 The Court specifically allowed the electronic filing of applications 
for bail and granted trial court judges a wider latitude of discretion 
for a lowered bail amount effective during the period of the present 
public health emergency. The circular also sanctioned the electronic 
transmission of bail application approvals and directed the consequent 
release order to be issued within the same day to the proper law 
enforcement authority or detention facility to enable the release of the
 accused.
