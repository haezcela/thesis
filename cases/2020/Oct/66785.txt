D E C I S I O N




DELOS SANTOS, J.:


 
The Case


 Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated August 25, 2017 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated May 15, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 
107364 which ordered petitioners Danilo Decena (Danilo) and Cristina 
Castillo (Cristina; petitioners) to pay respondent Asset Pool A 
(SPV-AMC), Inc. (respondent) the amount of P10,000,000.00 plus interest 
of 12% per annum from September 19, 2006 to June 30, 2013 and 6% 
interest per annum from July 1, 2013 until the obligation is fully paid.
  
  
 
The Facts


 On January 14, 2008, respondent filed a Complaint for Sum of Money and Damages
[4]
 against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City.
[5]

 Respondent alleged that petitioners applied for and were granted loans 
in the total amount of P20,000,000.00 by Prudential Bank. Prudential 
Bank then merged with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and BPI 
became the surviving corporation. Respondent alleged that petitioners 
defaulted in their contractual obligations and left an unpaid obligation
 of P10,000,000.00 evidenced by Promissory Note dated January 21, 1998 
and P2,500,000.00 evidenced by Promissory Note dated October 6, 1997.
[6]


 On May 12, 2006, BPI assigned petitioners' indebtedness to 
respondent through a deed of assignment and BPI's rights and interest 
over the said receivables were then ceded to respondent. On September 
19, 2006, respondent sent a notice to petitioners directing them to pay 
their unpaid obligation. On May 17, 2007, respondent sent petitioners 
another demand letter to settle their outstanding obligation. Having 
failed to heed  respondent's repeated demands, respondent filed a 
complaint with the RTC against petitioners.
[7]


 In petitioners' Answer, petitioners admitted that they loaned 
from Prudential Bank. However, as far as they knew, that loan obligation
 had already been substantially paid. Petitioners claimed that 
respondent had the burden of proving its claim and that no comprehensive
 records were ever presented to them. Petitioners also averred that the 
complaint should have been dismissed outright on the ground of laches 
since the complaint was filed only after almost 10 years from the 
maturity dates of the two loans.
[8]


 During trial, Isabelita Martinez Ciabal (Ciabal) testified 
that she was a Director and Remedial Account Officer for respondent 
since 2009. Ciabal testified that she was in charge of collection of bad
 and non-performing loans and that petitioners' loan account was one of 
the numerous accounts that was conveyed to respondent by BPI through a 
deed of assignment. Ciabal testified that respondent tried to contact 
petitioners and even sent them demand letters. Unfortunately, respondent
 did not receive any reply prompting it to refer the matter to their 
legal counsel for legal action. On cross-examination, Ciabal testified 
that she was not an employee of BPI and Prudential Bank. Ciabal 
explained that the principal obligation of petitioners was 
P12,500,000.00 and that based on the promissory notes, the total 
chargeable interest was 15%. Ciabal claimed that petitioners were duly 
informed and that respondent's counsel sent petitioners a demand letter 
dated May 17, 2007 which was received by Ramon Polangco.
[9]

 Danilo testified that Cristina, his co-petitioner in the present case, 
was his former wife and that he merely learned of the existence of the 
loan after he suddenly received a notice. Danilo claimed that Cristina 
called him and discussed the said transaction with the bank which he 
testified he could not fully remember the exact details. Danilo claimed 
that he recalled that sometime in 1996 and 1998, they both obtained 
loans in the amount of P19,600,000.00, P3,000,000.00 and P6,800,000.00 
from Prudential Bank. Danilo claimed that they were able to pay 
substantial amounts and the loans were settled in 2004 when Prudential 
Bank foreclosed their properties that were offered as collateral.
[10]

 Danilo claimed that he was surprised when respondent filed the instant 
collection case since all their debts with Prudential Bank had already 
been paid in full. Danilo also testified that he could not remember the 
two promissory notes presented by respondent as basis for their unpaid 
indebtedness.
 
The Ruling of the RTC


 In a Decision
[11]
 
dated December 11, 2015, the RTC of Makati City, Branch 150, held that 
petitioners were liable for the loan obligation to respondents. The RTC 
held that respondents proved their claim by preponderance of evidence 
which clearly outweighs the bare assertions and denial of petitioners. 
The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision provides: 
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, plaintiff having proved its 
claim by preponderance of evidence against defendants Danilo Decena and 
Crisitina Decena, judgment is hereby rendered ordering them to pay 
plaintiff Asset Pool A (SPV-AMC) jointly and severally the following: 


 the principal amount of Php12,500,000.00 plus 12% interest 
and 6% penalty charges per annum from September 19, 2006 until finality 
of the Decision; 
6% interest per annum on the principal from finality of the Decision until the obligation is fully paid;
Php25,000.00 as Attorney's Fees; and
costs of suit. 


 The counterclaim of defendants is dismissed for failure to prove its existence. 


 SO ORDERED.
[12]
 




 Petitioners then filed an appeal before the CA. 
 
The Ruling of the CA


 In a Decision
[13]
 
dated August 25, 2017, the CA partially affirmed the Decision of the 
RTC. The CA ruled that respondent established, through preponderance of 
evidence, petitioners' liability for the amount due. The CA held that 
petitioners never impugned the authenticity of the signatures on the 
promissory notes. The CA also found that petitioners also admitted 
having obtained loans from then Prudential Bank. Jurisprudence clearly 
provides that the person who pleads payment has the burden of proving 
payment. The CA held that the burden clearly rests on the petitioners to
 prove payment rather than on the respondent to prove non-payment. The 
CA also held that when a creditor is in possession of a document of 
credit, proof of non-payment is unnecessary for it is already presumed. 
The CA found that the respondent's possession of the promissory notes 
strongly buttresses its claim that petitioners' obligation has not yet 
been extinguished. 
 However, the CA reduced the principal amount 
to P10,000,000.00 since the prayer contained in respondent's complaint 
only asked for the specific amount of P10,000,000.00. The CA ruled that 
the rule is settled that courts cannot award more than what was 
specifically prayed for in the complaint. 
 The dispositive portion of the CA Decision provides: 
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is PARTIALLY 
GRANTED. The December 11, 2015 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of 
Makati City, Branch 150, is MODIFIED in that defendants-appellants are 
ORDERED to pay the plaintiff-appellee, jointly and severally, the 
principal amount of P10,000,000.00 plus interest of 12% per annum from 
September 19, 2006 to June 20, 2013, and 6% interest from July 1, 2013 
until the obligation is fully paid. In all other respects, the assailed 
Decision is AFFIRMED. 


 SO ORDERED.
[14]
 




 In a Resolution
[15]
 dated May 15, 2018, the CA denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration. 
 
The Issue


 The issue for the Court's resolution is whether petitioners are liable for the amount due. 
 
The Ruling of the Court


 The records of the case show that two promissory notes signed 
by petitioners were duly presented in the RTC: (1) P10,000,000.00  
evidenced by Promissory Note dated January 21, 	1998; and (2) 
P2,500,000.00 evidenced by Promissory Note dated October 6, 1997. 	
Petitioners then contend that the two aforementioned promissory notes 
had already been settled or paid by them. 	In 
Royal Cargo Corporation v. DFS Sports Unlimited, Inc.
,
[16]

  the Court held that in civil cases, the one who pleads payment has the
 burden of proving payment. The burden of proving payment, thus, rests 
on the defendant once proof of indebtedness is established. In fact, in a
 long line of cases, the Court has consistently held that the party 
alleging payment must necessarily prove his or her claim of payment.
[17]
 When the creditor is in possession of the document of credit, proof of non-payment is not needed for it is presumed.
[18]
 In 
Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Royeca
,
[19]

 the Court held that a promissory note in the hands of the creditor is 
proof of indebtedness and not of payment. Verily, the creditor's 
possession of an evidence of indebtedness is proof that the debt has not
 been discharged by payment, to wit:
  


 The creditor's possession of the evidence of debt is proof that 
the debt has not been discharged by payment. A promissory note in the 
hands of the creditor is a proof of indebtedness rather than proof of 
payment. In an action for replevin by a mortgagee, it is 
prima facie

 evidence that the promissory note has not been paid. Likewise, [a 
non-canceled] mortgage in the possession of the mortgagee gives rise to 
the presumption that the mortgage debt is unpaid.
[20]




 Upon perusing the records, the Court finds that there is no merit 
in petitioners' claim that their loan obligation had already been paid. 
Neither is there merit in petitioners' argument that the said loan 
obligation to respondent was deemed satisfied when the properties they 
mortgaged to secure the loans were supposedly foreclosed. Petitioners 
clearly failed to present documentary evidence of payment and evidence 
that the mortgaged properties were actually used to secure the subject 
promissory notes. As pointed out by the CA, Danilo was even unaware 
whether the properties petitioners previously mortgaged were used to 
secure their previous loans or the loans covered by the promissory 
notes, to wit: 
  






Q:


Do you have any proof to 
show to this court any payment by you on the Php 10 Million which you 
have obtained from Prudential Bank? 






A:


 
As of now, I cannot recall I have to consult again with... 






 


 






Q:


Nandito ka na sa husgado, ito na ang panahon hindi na pwedeng bukas ngayon na
[.]






A:


 
I cannot show proof right now at [this] point in time. 






 


 






Q:


So all that you are saying, it is just 
your belief that this loan covered by the promissory note had already 
been paid when the bank foreclosed the collaterals which you offered? 






A:


That is correct, Your Honor as far as I know.






 


 






Q:


 
Is it correct that the properties 
offered amounting to Php26 Million were offered not for this loan but 
for the previous loans which you obtained from the bank?






A:


 
I cannot answer that. Sorry Your Honor.
[21]








In fact, as correctly ruled by the CA, it was Danilo who admitted 
the genuineness of his signatures in the Promissory Notes dated October 
6, 1997 and January 21, 1998. The records provide: 








Q:


Look at this document Mr. witness subject matter of this case Mr. Decena Exhibit "A"? 






A:


 
Yes, Your Honor.






 


 






Q:


Will you see if you affix your signature? 






A:


Yes, Your Honor, that is my signature. 






 


 






Q:


 
That is your signature. And will you examine your signature and tell the court if you are familiar with this signature?






A:


Yes, Your Honor.






 


 






Q:


x x x [S]ince you have admitted signing
 this document is it the impression of the court that you are also 
admitting the loan covered by the promissory note which you obtained 
from Prudential Bank? 






A:


Yes, Your Honor.
[22]








The Court agrees with the CA that the existence of the promissory 
notes, coupled with their own admission, had already established 
petitioners' indebtedness to respondent. From the foregoing, the Court 
finds that petitioners remain liable for the two promissory notes 
because they had failed to discharge the burden of proving their 
payment. Indeed, as held by the Court, when the existence of a debt is 
fully established by the evidence contained in the record, the burden of
 proving that it has been extinguished by payment devolves upon the 
debtor who offers such defense to the claim of the creditor.
[23]
 The debtor has the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment.
[24]
 Having failed to discharge such burden, petitioners remain liable for their indebtedness to respondent.






Petitioners are liable for P12,500,000.00 as the principal amount of the claim.
 






The CA ruled that, while the complaint alleged that petitioners had
 an unpaid balance of P12,500,000.00 and that the same had already 
ballooned due to interest and penalty charges, the amount prayed for in 
respondent's complaint was the amount of P10,000,000.00. Hence, 
petitioners could only be liable for the amount of P10,000,000.00.
  
 We disagree with the finding of the CA. 
 The principle 
that the "courts cannot grant a relief not prayed for in the pleadings 
or in excess of what is being sought by the party"
[25]

 is generally a principle of law founded on due process. Due process, 
thus, requires that judgments must conform to and be supported by the 
pleadings and evidence presented in court.
[26]
 Notwithstanding, in 
Development Bank of the Philippines v. Teston
,
[27]

 the Court explained that the foregoing due process requirement is 
satisfied when the opposing party is given notice and opportunity to be 
heard with respect to the proposed relief, to wit:
  


 Due process considerations justify this requirement. It is 
improper to enter an order which exceeds the scope of relief sought by 
the pleadings, 
absent notice which affords the opposing party an opportunity to be heard with respect to the proposed relief
.
 The fundamental purpose of the requirement that allegations of a 
complaint must provide the measure of recovery is to prevent surprise to
 the defendant.
[28]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 In the present case, respondent specifically averred in its 
complaint that its cause of action was based on the two promissory notes
 issued by petitioners for a total amount of P12,500,000.00. Both the 
due execution and the non-payment thereof were sufficiently proven 
during trial with petitioners' active participation. Petitioners were, 
thus, not unduly deprived of their opportunity to be heard with respect 
to the total amount of the promissory notes of P12,500,000.00. Hence, it
 cannot be said that petitioners will be unduly surprised since 
petitioners actively participated and were given due notice during the 
whole proceedings. Accordingly, the CA erred when it reduced the 
principal amount to P10,000,000.00 only. 
 As regards the computation of interest, in 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
,
[29]

 the Court pronounced the rules in determining the amount of interest 
during breaches of obligations of a payment of a sum of money including a
 loan or forbearance of money, to wit: 
  


 Thus, from the foregoing, in the absence of an express 
stipulation as to the rate of interest that would govern the parties, 
the rate of legal interest for loans or forbearance of any money, goods 
or credits and the rate allowed in judgments shall no longer be twelve 
percent (12%) per annum - as reflected in the case of 
Eastern Shipping Lines

 and Subsection X305.1 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks and 
Sections 4305Q.1, 4305S.3 and 4303P.1 of the Manual of Regulations for 
Non-Bank Financial Institutions, before its amendment by BSP-MB Circular
 No. 799 -	but will now be six percent (6%) per annum effective July 1, 
2013.
 It should be noted, nonetheless, that the new rate could only 
be applied prospectively and not retroactively. Consequently, the twelve
 percent (12%) per annum legal interest shall apply only until June 30, 
2013. Come July 1, 2013 the new rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall
 be the prevailing rate of interest 
when applicable
. 


 x x x x






1.


When the obligation is 
breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan
 or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have
 been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself 
earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. 
In the 
absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum to be
 computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand 
under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.














2.


When an obligation, not 
constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on
 the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the 
court at the rate of 6% per annum.
 No interest, however, shall 
be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the 
demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where 
the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall 
begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or 
extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot 
be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the 
interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court
 is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to 
have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation 
of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.
[30]
 (Citation omitted; emphases supplied)








There are two types of interest, namely: (1) monetary interest, 
which is the compensation fixed by the parties for the use or 
forbearance of money; and (2) compensatory interest, which is that 
imposed by law or by the courts as penalty or indemnity for damages. 
Accordingly, the right to recover interest rates arises either by virtue
 of a contract or monetary interest, or as damages for delay or failure 
to pay the principal loan which is demanded or compensatory interest.
[31]


 In the present case, it was established that petitioners' 
principal loan obligation to respondent was P12,500,000.00. The original
 monetary interest was then struck down by the RTC as unconscionable. In
 
Isla v. Estorga
,
[32]
 
the Court ruled that when the parties' stipulated interest rate is 
struck down for being excessive and unconscionable, the unconscionable 
interest rate is nullified and deemed not written in the contract. In
 Isla
,
 the Court held that in cases where the interest rate is struck down as 
unconscionable the legal rate of interest prevailing at the time the 
agreement was entered into will be applied by the Court, to wit: 
  


 [I]t is well to clarify that only the unconscionable interest 
rate is nullified and deemed not written in the contract; whereas the 
parties' agreement on the payment of interest on the principal loan 
obligation subsists. It is as if the parties failed to specify the 
interest rate to be imposed on the principal amount, in which case the 
legal rate of interest prevailing at the time the agreement was entered 
into is applied by the Court. This is because, according to 
jurisprudence, the legal rate of interest is the presumptive reasonable 
compensation for borrowed money.
[33]




 Applying the foregoing Decisions of the Court in the present case,
 the principal amount of P12,500,000.00, thus, should earn the straight 
monetary interest of 12% per annum reckoned from the date of 
extrajudicial demand or, in the present case, on September 19, 2006 
until finality of the ruling. Further, in accordance with Article 2212
[34]

 of the Civil Code, the stipulated monetary interest should also earn 
compensatory interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the time of 
judicial demand or, in the present case, on January 14, 2008 until June 
30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of the 
ruling.
[35]
 Finally, all monetary awards will earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from finality of the ruling until full payment.
