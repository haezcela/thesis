THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 201022, March 17, 2021 ]


TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (TESDA), PETITIONER, VS. ERNESTO ABRAGAR, RESPONDENT.




HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 challenges the March 13, 2012 Decision
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 106253 which annulled the June 30, 20 08
[3]
 and August 29, 2008
[4]

 Resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC 
NCR CANo. 043526-05 that granted petitioner Technical Education and 
Skills Development Authority's (TESDA) 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention
[5]
 in the said case.


The Factual Antecedents:
 
On April 29, 2003, respondent Ernesto Abragar (Abragar) filed a complaint
[6]

 before the Regional Arbitration Branch of the NLRC in San Fernando 
City, Pampanga for underpayment and non-payment of salaries/wages, 
service incentive leave, and 13
th
 month pay against a certain
 Marble Center (used interchangeably with the "Marble Training Center" 
or "Marble Production Training Center"; hereinafter referred to as the 
Center) with address at TESDA, Guiguinto, Bulacan, and his supervisor, 
Philip Bronio (Bronio). Summons was served on the said parties 
via
 registered mail at the abovementioned address.
[7]
 An amended complaint
[8]

 was later filed to include constructive dismissal, non-payment of 
separation pay and retirement pay, and payment of damages and attorney's
 fees. 
During the mandatory conference, Bronio appeared as the apparent 
representative of the Center and both parties were encouraged to settle 
the case amicably.
[9]
 When no 
amicable settlement was reached, the mandatory conference was terminated
 and the parties were ordered to file their respective position papers.
[10]

In his Position Paper,
[11]
 
Abragar described the Center as a corporation organized and existing in 
accordance with Philippine laws. He alleged that the Center's address is
 the TESDA Compound in Tabang, Guiguinto, Bulacan. He further claimed 
that he was hired in September 1997 as a marble operator for the Center 
and was tasked to cut and trim marbles in accordance with the prescribed
 orders, until sometime in December 2002 when the Center suddenly cut 
down his working days from six to twice or thrice a week, without giving
 him the usual salary he received for the week. Also, his 13th month pay
 was reduced despite his pleas that he be allowed to maintain his former
 work schedule. Respondent claimed that the reduction of his work 
schedule and pay amounted to constructive dismissal. 
On the other hand, the Center and Bronio failed to submit their position
 paper and thus were deemed to have waived their right to present 
evidence. 
[12]


In a July 30, 2004 Decision,
[13]

 the Labor Arbiter (LA) found that Abragar was constructively dismissed 
and granted his claim for unpaid salaries, service incentive leave, and 
13
th
 month pay. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered 
declaring illegal complainant's dismissal. Consequently, respondents are
 hereby held liable and ordered to pay complainant's separation pay as 
prayed for by him in lieu of reinstatement in the amount of P28,630.00 
and backwages in the sum of P109,174.00.

Respondents are likewise ordered to pay complainant's salary 
differential in the sum of P17,492.67, service incentive leave pay of 
P3,007.50 and 13
th
 month pay of P5,746.00.
 All other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.
 SO ORDERED.
[14]


There being no appeal filed within the reglementary period, Abragar 
moved for the issuance of a writ of execution to carry out the 
aforementioned decision.
[15]
 
On December 29, 2004, Bronio filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[16]

 before the LA insisting that there was no employer-employee 
relationship between Abragar and the Center. He asserted that the Center
 is a mere cooperative and training center of TESDA under the 
cooperation of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Provincial 
Government of Bulacan. The Center merely serves as a training ground for
 workers who intend to work in the private sector upon completion of the
 training courses under TESDA. However, no action was taken on the said 
motion. 

Thus, on January 25, 2005, Bronio filed a Petition for Relief from 
Judgment,
[17]
 where he 
reiterated that the Center is a non-juridical entity but a mere training
 facility run by TESDA and created pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement
 (MOA)
[18]
 executed by and 
among the DTI, the Provincial Government of Bulacan, the Marble 
Association of the Philippines (MAP), the National Manpower and Youth 
Council (now renamed TESDA; hereinafter referred to collectively as the 
MOA Parties). Under the MOA, the said parties undertook to pool and 
share their resources, facilities, and expertise for the establishment 
of a functional marble production and training center. Moreover, Bronio 
alleged that he is merely an employee and trainor-supervisor of MAP and 
thus cannot be held liable for any of the acts of the Center, and that 
respondent is not an employee but a trainee of the Center. 

Abragar filed an Opposition
[19]
 thereto, and the petition was referred to the NLRC.


In a June 30, 2006 Resolution,
[20]

 the NLRC dismissed the petition for relief from judgment. It held that 
since no appeal was filed against the LA Decision by Bronio and the 
Center, it already became final and executory. No appeal was filed in 
connection with the said resolution; thus, an Entry of Judgment
[21]
 of the LA's July 30, 2004 Decision was issued by the NLRC. 


Execution of the LA Decision:
 
The LA thereafter issued a Writ of Execution
[22]

 directing the sheriff to enforce the July 30, 2004 Decision by 
proceeding to the premises of Marble Center and Bronio located at TESDA,
 Guiguinto, Bulacan and collect the total judgment amount. Upon failure 
to collect the same, the sheriff was directed to cause the full 
satisfaction of the same from the properties of Marble Center and Bronio
 that are not exempt from execution.
[23]

 However, the sheriff reported that he and Abragar were denied entry by 
security into the premises of the Center in the TESDA Compound when they
 tried to levy on the movable properties of the Center.
[24]
 Thus, Abragar filed a Motion (For Issuance Of A Break Open Order.
[25]

On June 14, 2007, Bronio filed a Motion to Quash the Writ of Execution
[26]

 which Abragar opposed on the ground that the Decision of the NLRC is 
already fmal and executory and must be carried out without further 
delay.
[27]
 


TESDA's Appeal Memorandum in
Intervention:
 

On September 25, 2007, petitioner TESDA filed an 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention
[28]

 with the NLRC praying for the quashal of the writ of execution and 
break-open order issued by the LA and for the remand of the case to the 
LA for further proceedings. Petitioner, in substance, alleged that (a) 
the Center is a marble processing facility run by TESDA and a 
non-juridical entity without capacity to sue or be sued; (b) the Center 
is a joint undertaking formed pursuant to the aforementioned MOA agreed 
upon among the MOA Parties that pooled their resources for the conduct 
of training and job induction programs for TESDA applicant-trainees; (c)
 the writ of execution and break-open order, while directed at 
"respondents Marble Center & Philip Bronio at TESDA, Guiguinto, 
Bulacan," was actually directed at TESDA as the former's address is 
clearly the address of TESDA and occupied exclusively by the said 
agency; (d) Bronio was the caretaker and supervisor assigned by MAP to 
oversee the resources and facilities in the Center; and (e) despite the 
aforementioned facts; it was never notified nor impleaded in the case. 
Thus, TESDA alleged that the LA committed grave abuse of discretion when
 he grossly misappreciated the facts of the case and issued the appealed
 decision, the writ of execution and break-open order, which if not 
corrected, would cause grave injury to TESDA.
[29]
 

Abragar filed an Opposition
[30]

 thereto and alleged that the same must be denied outright for failure 
to comply with procedural requirements. He likewise insists that TESDA 
slept on its right to appeal and that the said Order had long become 
final and executory. Abragar averred that, in any case, TESDA will not 
be affected by the execution of the LA's July 30, 2004 Decision and thus
 has no right to intervene.

The NLRC in a June 30, 2008 Resolution
[31]
 gave due course to TESDA's appeal in intervention. The 
fallo
 of the Resolution reads:


WHEREFORE, the appeal of TESDA is GRANTED. The assailed 
decision is VACATED and SET ASIDE. The corresponding writ of execution 
is QUASHED and the order to break open issues pursuant thereto is also 
VACATED and SET ASIDE. Complainant is directed to amend his complaint to
 implead the real parties in interest. The case is hereby REMANDED for 
further appropriate proceedings.

SO ORDERED.
[32]


In so ruling, the NLRC cited Article 221 of the Labor Code which 
provides that technical rules are not binding and that the LA shall use 
every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case 
speedily and objectively and without regard to technicalities of law or 
procedure, in the interest of due process, and Section 218(c) of the 
Labor Code which empowers the NLRC to direct parties to be joined in or 
excluded from the proceedings, correct, amend, or waive any error, 
defect or irregularity, whether in substance or in form, give all such 
direction as it may deem necessary and expedient in the determination of
 the dispute. The NLRC noted that TESDA's 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention
,
 while peculiar, is impressed with substantial allegations that if 
proven true would result to a clear denial of due process and 
miscarriage of justice.
[33]
 
Moreover, the NLRC stressed that nothing on record shows that the Center
 is a juridical person authorized to be made a party to any case as it 
is not clothed with legal personality to be sued, and the question 
remained on how it can be held liable for illegal dismissal and payment 
of money claims. Thus, the NLRC held that the real parties-in-interest 
appear to be TESDA, DTI, the Provincial Government of Bulacan and the 
MAP, which should be joined as parties even if only alternatively, 
conformably with Rule 3, Sections 1 and 2 of the Rules of Court. The 
NLRC thereafter noted that the assailed order was void which can never 
attain finality.
[34]
 

Respondent moved for reconsideration,
[35]
 which was denied by the NLRC.
[36]
 Entry of judgment of the August 29, 2008 Resolution was issued on December 10, 2008.


Proceedings in the Court of Appeals:


Aggrieved, respondent filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
[37]

 before the CA assailing the June 30, 2008 and August 29, 2008 
Resolutions of the NLRC. The Office of the Solicitor General on behalf 
of TESDA filed a Comment thereto.


In a March 13, 2012 Decision,
[38]

 the CA reversed and set aside the NLRC's Resolutions dated June 30, 
2008 and August 29, 2008. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision 
reads:


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
GRANTED
. Accordingly, the resolutions dated June 30, 2008 and August 29, 2008, of the public respondent NLRC are 
NULLIFIED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Accordingly, the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated July 30, 2004 is 
REINSTATED
.


SO ORDERED.
[39]


The appellate court opined that the failure of the Center and Bronio to 
perfect their appeal in the manner and within the period fixed by law 
rendered the July 30, 2004 Decision of the LA and the June 30, 2006 
Resolution which dismissed the petition for relief from judgment final 
and executory. Moreover, the appellate court stressed that the Revised 
Rules of Court which apply suppletorily to labor cases provide that a 
motion to intervene may be filed any time before rendition of judgment 
by the trial court. Thus, TESDA should have filed its pleading in 
intervention with the Regional Arbitration Branch and before the 
rendition of the LA's July 30, 2004 Decision instead of filing the same 
three years and one month from the said decision, when the LA's July 30,
 2004 Decision and the resolution dismissing the petition for relief had
 long become final and executory. Hence, this Petition.


Issue


The fundamental issue for resolution is whether the CA erred in annulling the NLRC's grant of petitioner's 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention
.


Our Ruling


The petition has merit.


The Center has no juridical

personality and thus has no legal
capacity to 
be sued. Hence, the
indispensable parties
 should be
impleaded in the proceedings.
 

Petitioner argues that the Center against whom the labor complaint was 
filed below is not a juridical entity nor authorized by law to sue or be
 sued but merely a training and skill development facility operated by 
petitioner in TESDA's premises pursuant to the MO A. Accordingly, since 
only natural or juridical persons, or entities authorized by law may be 
parties in a civil action and the joinder of indispensable parties is 
mandatory, the Center should not have been impleaded as a party to the 
complaint below. Instead, the parties who created it should have been 
impleaded as party-respondents in the labor complaint below as 
indispensable parties.
[40]


On the other hand, respondent contends that petitioner's claim that the 
Center is a non-juridical entity with no legal personality to sue or be 
sued is a belated claim raised for the first time on appeal. Thus, it 
should not be entertained because it would be unjust for a third person 
to be allowed to circumvent labor laws by claiming that a person or 
company who acted as an employer is a non-juridical entity which cannot 
sue or be sued. Further, respondent maintains that petitioner's claim 
that it is an indispensable party is misleading. Respondent points out 
that his claims are borne by the existing employer-employee relationship
 between the Center and respondent, and that the terms and conditions of
 the MOA surrounding the creation of Marble Center are not binding as to
 him since he was not privy to the same.
[41]
 

We rule for petitioner. 

Sections 1 and 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court mandate that only natural
 or juridical persons, or entities authorized by law may be parties in a
 civil action and every action must be prosecuted and defended in the 
name of the real parties-in-interest.
[42]
 In connection thereto, in 
Litonjua Group of Companies v. Vigan
,
[43]

 this Court found that the Litonjua Group of Companies, which therein 
respondent sought to hold solidarity liable for illegal dismissal, was 
not a legal entity with juridical personality and hence could not be 
held a party to the suit.
[44]
 
Similarly, the Center which respondent seeks to hold liable has no 
juridical personality nor is it an entity authorized by law to be a 
party to any action; it has no legal capacity to sue or be sued and 
should not have been impleaded as defendant in the instant case.


Respondent, to bolster his claim, alleged that it would be unjust for a 
third person to be allowed to circumvent labor laws by claiming that a 
person or company who acted as an employer is a non-juridical entity 
which cannot sue or be sued. To be sure, the Court, in the interest of 
preventing injustice and unfairness, has previously prevented 
non-existent corporations from raising its lack of juridical personality
 as a means to avoid fulfillment of its contracts or obligations by 
applying the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. This doctrine has been
 codified in Section 20 of the Corporation Code, which provides that all
 persons who assume to act as a corporation knowing it to be without the
 authority to do so shall be liable as general partners for all debts, 
liabilities, and damages incurred or arising as a result thereof. 

However, the attendant circumstances do not call for the application of 
the said doctrine. While the Center appears to be managed by TESDA in 
collaboration with MAP and involves a pooling of resources by the DTI, 
TESDA, Provincial Government of Bulacan, and MAP, a careful review of 
the records fails to show that the MOA Parties represented that the 
Center had its own juridical personality in its dealings with respondent
 or third persons. In fact, as pertinently alleged by petitioner, the 
employment contract submitted by respondent in evidence was with MAP 
Multi-Purpose Cooperative Incorporated. 
[45]


Moreover, this Court is not inclined to rule that TESDA and the other 
parties to the MOA shall be held liable as general partners to 
respondent's claims against the Center for non-payment of wages, 
benefits, and illegal dismissal without giving them their day in court. 
It is a basic tenet of due process of law that a person cannot be 
prejudiced by a ruling rendered in an action or proceeding in which he 
was not made a party.
[46]
 In 
the context of administrative proceedings, due process refers to an 
opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek 
reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of 
[47]

 It would also be wholly unjust to consider Bronio's appearance in the 
proceedings below as sufficient compliance with this due process 
requirement insofar as the MOA parties are concerned. Relevantly, the 
pleadings filed by Bronio in the proceedings below which purported to 
represent himself and the Center was signed only by himself. The records
 are likewise devoid of any indication that Bronio was authorized to 
attend the hearings on behalf of any of the MOA Parties or if such 
authority was ascertained by the labor tribunals during the proceedings 
below. As previously alleged by Bronio himself, he was a mere employee 
and tr ainor-supervisor of MAP tasked to supervise the operations of the
 Center. 

Given the foregoing, the proper remedy in this case is the joinder of 
the proper parties.
[48]
 In 
connection thereto, the mandatory rule on joinder of indispensable 
parties is set forth in Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, to wit:


SEC. 7. 
Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties
. -
 Parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of 
an action shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants.


"Indispensable parties are parties whose legal presence in the 
proceeding is so necessary that 'the action cannot be finally 
determined' without them because their interests in the matter and in 
the relief are so bound up with that of the other parties."
[49]
 This Court has previously laid down the test to determine if a party is an indispensable party, thus:


An indispensable party is a party who has an interest in the
 controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made,
 in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest, a party 
who has not only an interest in the subject matter of the controversy, 
but also has an interest of such nature that a final decree cannot be 
made without affecting his interest or leaving the controversy in such a
 condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with 
equity and good conscience. It has also been considered that an 
indispensable party is a person in whose absence there cannot be a 
determination between the parties already before the court which is 
effective, complete, or equitable. Further, an indispensable party is 
one who must be included in an action before it may properly go forward.

A person is not an indispensable party, however, if his interest in the 
controversy or subject matter is separable from the interest of the 
other parties, so that it will not necessarily be directly or 
injuriously affected by a decree which does complete justice between 
them. Also, a person is not an indispensable party if his presence would
 merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to 
the action, or if he has no interest in the subject matter of the 
action. It is not a sufficient reason to declare a person to be an 
indispensable party that his presence will avoid multiple litigation.
[50]


Applying the foregoing test, the Court finds that the MOA Parties are 
indispensable parties as their interest in the controversy is such that a
 final adjudication cannot be made in their absence, without injuring or
 affecting their interest. As alleged by respondent himself, his claims 
are anchored in his employer-employee relationship with the Center. In 
view of the lack of juridical personality of the Center, any judgment in
 favor of respondent against the Center would have to be enforced 
against the properties contributed by the MOA Parties. A perusal of the 
MOA shows that DTI contributed pre-operating expenses, machinery, and 
consumables required for training and marble processing; the Provincial 
Government of Bulacan allowed the use of its provincial lot where the 
Center operates to TESDA for training purposes, and which TESDA in turn 
earmarked for the Center's operations; and MAP provides supplies and 
materials for training and skills testing. 
Further, under the MOA, TESDA is in charge of organizing the conduct of 
training and job induction programs, entrepreneurship development 
training, as well as supervising and coordinating all training-related 
activities, while MAP is mandated to oversee the efficient 
implementation of the activities under the Project Work Plan of TESDA, 
ensure the efficient implementation of activities contained therein, 
manage the Center operations, and provide supplies and materials for 
training and skills testing. 

Verily, the interest of the MOA Parties in the subject matter of the 
suit and in the relief sought are so inextricably intertwined such that 
their legal presence as a party to the proceedings is an absolute 
necessity. While we wish to abide by the mandate on speedy disposition 
of cases, more so considering that what is involved here is the welfare 
of a worker, we cannot allow a judgment that would ultimately be 
enforced against one or more of the MOA Parties without giving them 
their day in court. To do so will result in a possible violation of due 
process. Their inclusion is necessary for the effective and complete 
resolution of the case and in order to accord all parties the benefit of
 due process and fair play. 
There are two consequences of a finding on appeal that indispensable 
parties have not been joined. First, all subsequent actions of the lower
 courts are null and void for lack of jurisdiction; second, the case 
should be remanded to the trial court for the inclusion of indispensable
 parties.
[51]
 Considering the foregoing, the CA erred in setting aside the NLRC's grant of petitioner's 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention
.


The failure to implead TESDA and 
the other parties to the MOA renders 
the proceedings void, which may be 
questioned at any time.
 
Abragar asserts that petitioner's 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention

 was filed way beyond the period allowed by law and the LA Decision had 
already become final and executory. On the other hand, TESDA asserts 
that the failure to implead petitioner, among others, renders the 
Decision dated July 30, 2004 of the LA, writ of execution, and 
break-open order null and void for want of authority, which may be 
attacked in any way at any time, even when no appeal is taken. 
We agree with petitioner. 

The joinder of all indispensable parties is a condition 
sine qua non
 for the exercise of judicial power. While the failure to implead an indispensable party is not 
per se

 a ground for the dismissal of an action, considering that said party 
may still be added by order of the court, on motion of the party or on 
its own initiative at any stage of the action and/or such times as are 
just, it remains essential â 
as it is jurisdictional
 â that any indispensable party be impleaded in the proceedings before 
the court renders judgment
.
[52]

 The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of
 the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to 
the absent parties but even as to those present.
[53]
 

A void judgment is in effect no judgment at all, and all acts performed 
under it and all claims flowing out of it are void. The judgment is 
vulnerable to attack even when no appeal has been taken, and does not 
become final in the sense of depriving a party of his right to question 
its validity.
[54]
 
Thus, the failure to implead petitioner and the other parties to the MOA
 renders the July 30, 2004 Decision of the LA, writ of execution, and 
break- open order null and void for want of authority, which may be 
attacked in any way at any time, even when no appeal is taken. It is 
immaterial that petitioner filed the 
Appeal Memorandum in Intervention
 after the LA judgment became allegedly final and executory, since a judgment void 
ab initio
 is non-existent and thus cannot acquire finality.


WHEREFORE,
 the Petition is 
GRANTED
. The assailed March 13, 2012 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 106253 is hereby 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Let the case be 
REMANDED

 to the Regional Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations 
Commission in San Fernando City, Pampanga for the inclusion of Technical
 Education and Skills Development Authority, Department of Trade and 
Industry, Marble Association of the Philippines, and the Provincial 
Government of Bulacan, as parties-respondents and for further 
proceedings.
