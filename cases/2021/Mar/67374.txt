INTEGRATED BAR OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY REPRESENTED BY HON. SALVADOR C. MEDIALDEA, THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, REPRESENTED BY HON. ALAN PETER CAYETANO AND THE PERMANENT MISSION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES TO THE UNITED NATIONS, REPRESENTED BY HON. TEODORO LOCSIN, JR., RESPONDENTS.

LEONEN, J.:


Treaties may effectively implement the 
constitutional imperative to 
protect human rights and consider social justice in all phases of 
developmentâbut so can a statute, as Republic Act No. 9851, the 
Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, 
Genocide, and Other Crimes Against Humanity, does.
 The 
president,
 as primary architect of our foreign policy and as head of state, is 
allowed by the Constitution to make preliminary determinations on what, 
at any given moment, might urgently be required in order that our 
foreign policy may manifest our national interest. 
  
Absent a clear and convincing showing of a breach 
of the 
Constitution or a law, brought through an actual, live controversy and 
by a party that presents direct, material, and substantial injury as a 
result of such breach, this Court will stay its hand in declaring a 
diplomatic act as unconstitutional.
  
 On March 15, 2018, the Philippines announced its 
withdrawal 
from the International Criminal Court. On March 16, 2018, it formally 
submitted its Notice of Withdrawal through a Note Verbale to the United 
Nations Secretary-General's Chef de Cabinet. The Secretary General 
received this communication the following day, March 17, 
2018.
 
Through these actions, the Philippines completed the requisite acts of 
withdrawal. This was all consistent and in compliance with what the Rome
 Statute plainly requires. By this point, all that were needed to enable
 withdrawal have been consummated. Further, the International Criminal 
Court acknowledged the Philippines' action soon after it had withdrawn. 
This foreclosed the existence of a state of affairs correctible by this 
Court's finite jurisdiction. The Petitions were, therefore, moot when 
they were filed.
[1]
 The 
International Criminal Court's subsequent consummate acceptance of the 
withdrawal all but confirmed the futility of this Court's insisting on a
 reversal of completed actions.
 In any case, despite 
the 
withdrawal, this Court finds no lesser protection of human rights within
 our system of laws. Neither do we agree 	 with petitioners' implied 
statements that without the treaty, the judiciary will not be able to 
fulfill its mandate to protect human rights.
 
Moreover, the Senate
 never sought to enforce what would have been its prerogative to require
 its concurrence for withdrawal. To date, Resolution No. 249, which 
seeks to express the chamber's position on the need for concurrence, has
 yet to be tabled and voted on.
[2]

 Individual senators have standing to question the constitutionality of 
the actions of their chamber. Yet, in this case, as shown by the 
Resolution which petitioners co-authored, they acknowledged that an 
action by the Senate was necessary before coming to this Court. Thus, no
 actual conflict or constitutional impasse has yet arisen even as 
implied by their actions.
 This Court cannot compel or
 annul 
actions where the relevant incidents are moot. Neither can this Court, 
without due deference to the actions of a co-equal constitutional 
branch, act before the Senate has acted.
 Nonetheless,
 the President's discretion on unilaterally withdrawing from any treaty 
or international agreement is not absolute.

 As primary architect of foreign policy, the president enjoys a degree 
of leeway to withdraw from treaties. However, this leeway cannot go 
beyond the president's authority under the Constitution and the laws. In
 appropriate cases, legislative involvement is imperative. The president
 cannot unilaterally withdraw from a treaty if there is subsequent 
legislation which affirms and implements it.
 
Conversely, a treaty
 cannot amend a statute. When the president enters into a treaty that is
 inconsistent with a prior statute, the president may unilaterally 
withdraw from it, unless the prior statute is amended to be consistent 
with the treaty. A statute enjoys primacy over a treaty. It is passed by
 both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and is ultimately 
signed into law by the president. In contrast, a treaty is negotiated by
 the president, and legislative participation is limited to Senate 
concurrence. Thus, there is greater participation by the sovereign's 
democratically elected representatives in the enactment of 
statutes.

 The extent of legislative involvement in withdrawing from treaties is 
further determined by circumstances attendant to how the treaty was 
entered into or came into effect. Where legislative imprimatur impelled 
the president's action to enter into a treaty, a withdrawal cannot be 
effected without concomitant legislative sanction. Similarly, where the 
Senate's concurrence imposes as a condition the same concurrence for 
withdrawal, the president enjoys no unilateral authority to withdraw, 
and must then secure Senate concurrence.
 Thus, the 
president can 
withdraw from a treaty as a matter of policy in keeping with our legal 
system, if a treaty is unconstitutional or contrary to provisions of an 
existing prior statute. However, the president may not unilaterally 
withdraw from a treaty: (a) when the Senate conditionally concurs, such 
that it requires concurrence also to withdraw; or (b) when the 
withdrawal itself will be contrary to a statute, or to a legislative 
authority to negotiate and enter into a treaty, or an existing law which
 implements a treaty.
 This Court resolves 
consolidated Petitions 
for Certiorari and Mandamus under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil 
Procedure, seeking to: (a) declare the Philippines' withdrawal from the 
Rome Statute as invalid or ineffective, since it was done without the 
concurrence of at least two-thirds of all the Senate's members; and (b) 
compel the executive branch to notify the United Nations 
Secretary-General that it is cancelling, revoking, and withdrawing the 
Instrument of Withdrawal.
[3]
 Petitioners maintain that the Instrument of 
Withdrawal is inconsistent with the Constitution.

 The Rome Statute is a multilateral treaty that established the 
International Criminal Court, where the gravest crimes under 
international law are prosecuted.
[4]

 Since 1996, under Fidel V. Ramos's (President Ramos) presidency, the 
Philippines has participated in the court's establishment, taking an 
active role in the deliberations as a member of the Drafting 
Committee.
[5]

 On December 28, 2000, the Philippines, through then President Joseph 
Ejercito Estrada (President Estrada), signed the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court.
[6]

 President Estrada's act of signing the Rome Statute signified the 
Philippines' intent to be bound by the provisions of the treaty, subject
 to the domestic requirements for its validity and 
enforceability.
[7]

 Particularly, Article VII, Section 21 of the 1987 Constitution
[8]

 requires the concurrence by at least two-thirds of all members of the 
Senate for a treaty to be valid, binding, effective, and 
enforceable.
 In the meantime, on July 1, 2002, the 
International Criminal Court's   Rome Statute entered into force.
[9]

 On December 11, 2009, with Senate concurrence to the Rome Statute still
 pending, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (President 
Macapagal-Arroyo) signed into law Republic Act No. 9851, otherwise known
 as the Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law,
 Genocide, and Other Crimes Against Humanity. Republic Act No. 9851 
replicated many of the Rome Statute's provisions.
[10]

 Senate concurrence to the Rome Statute was obtained following President
 Benigno Aquino III's (President Aquino) election. On August 23, 2011, 
the Senate, with a vote of 17-1, passed Resolution No. 546âenabling the 
Philippines' consummate accession to the Rome Statute.
[11]

 On August 30, 2011, the Philippines deposited the instrument of 
ratification of the Rome Statute. On November 1, 2011, the Rome Statute 
entered into force in the Philippines. The country was the 
16
th
 state party to belong to the Group of 
Asia-Pacific State Parties in the International Criminal Court.
[12]

 On June 30, 2016, President Aquino's term ended and President Rodrigo 
Roa Duterte (President Duterte) took his oath as chief 
executive.

 On April 24, 2017, Atty. Jude Sabio filed a complaint before the 
International Criminal Court pertaining to alleged summary killings when
 President Duterte was the mayor of Davao City.
[13]


 On June 6, 2017, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and 
Representative Gary Alejano filed a "supplemental communication" before 
the International Criminal Court with regard to President Duterte's drug
 war.
[14]


 On February 8, 2018, the Office of International 
Criminal 
Court Trial Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda (Prosecutor Bensouda) commenced 
the preliminary examination of the atrocities allegedly committed in the
 Philippines pursuant to the Duterte administration's "war on 
drugs."
[15]

 On March 15, 2018, the Philippines announced that it was withdrawing 
from the International Criminal Court. President Duterte claimed that 
the country never became a state party to the Rome Statute since the 
treaty was not published in the Official Gazette.
[16]

  On March 16, 2018, the Philippines formally submitted its Notice of 
Withdrawal from the International Criminal Court to the United Nations. 
Enrique Manalo, the Permanent Representative of the Republic of the 
Philippines to the United Nations in New York, deposited the Note 
Verbale to Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Chef de Cabinet of the United 
Nations' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
[17]
 The full text of
 this notification reads:
  


 The Permanent Mission of the Republic of the Philippines 
to the 
United Nations presents its compliments to the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations and has the honor to inform the Secretary-General of the 
decision of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines to 
withdraw from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute. 


 The Philippines assures the community of nations that the 
Philippine Government continues to be guided by the rule of law embodied
 in its Constitution, which also enshrines the country's long-standing 
tradition of upholding human rights. 


 The Government affirms its commitment to fight against 
impunity 
for atrocity crimes, notwithstanding its withdrawal from the Rome 
Statute, especially since the Philippines has a national legislation 
punishing atrocity crimes. The Government remains resolute in effecting 
its principal responsibility to ensure the long-term safety of the 
nation in order to promote inclusive national development and secure a 
decent and dignified life for all.


 The decision to withdraw is the Philippines' principled 
stand 
against those who politicize and weaponize human rights, even as its 
independent and well-functioning organs and agencies continue to 
exercise jurisdiction over complaints, issues, problems and concerns 
arising from its efforts to protect its people.


 The Permanent Mission of the Republic of the Philippines 
to the 
United Nations avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations the assurances of its highest 
consideration.
[18]




 On March 17, 2018, the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations received the notification from the Philippine government.
[19]

 On May 16, 2018, Senators Francis Pangilinan (Senator Pangilinan), 
Franklin Drilon, Paolo Benigno Aquino, Leila De Lima, Risa Hontiveros, 
and Antonio Trillanes IV filed a Petition for Certiorari and 
Mandamus,
[20]

 assailing the executive's unilateral act of withdrawing from the Rome 
Statute for being unconstitutional. This Petition was docketed as G.R. 
No. 238875.
 Later, Senator Pangilinan would manifest 
in the oral 
arguments incidents relating to Senate Resolution No. 289, a "Resolution
 Expressing the Sense of the Senate that Termination of, or Withdrawal 
from, Treaties and International Agreements Concurred in by the Senate 
shall be Valid and Effective Only Upon Concurrence by the Senate." The 
Resolution was noted to have not been calendared for agenda in the 
Senate.
[21]
 Meanwhile, 
on June 13, 2018, the Philippine Coalition for the Establishment of the 
International Criminal Court, and its members, Loretta Ann P. Rosales, 
Dr. Aurora Corazon A. Parong, Evelyn Balais-Serrano, among others, also 
filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus, docketed as G.R. No. 
239483.
[22]
 On July 6, 2018, the Office 
of the Solicitor General filed its Consolidated Comment to the 
Petitions.
[23]
 On August 14, 2018, the 
Integrated Bar of the Philippines filed its own Petition,
[24]
 and an Omnibus 

Ex-Parte
 Motion for Consolidation and for Inclusion 
in the Oral Arguments.
[25]
 This Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 
240954.

 Oral arguments were conducted on August 28, 2018, September 4, 2018, 
and October 9, 2018. At the termination of oral arguments, this Court 
required the parties to file their respective memoranda within 30 
days.
[26]

 In his March 18, 2019 press release, the Assembly of State Parties' 
President Mr. O-Gon Kwon "reiterated his regret regarding the withdrawal
 of the Philippines, effective as of 17 March 2019, from the Rome 
Statute[.]"
[27]
 He
 expressed hope that the country rejoins the treaty in the 
future.
[28]
 The three consolidated 
Petitions before this Court seek similar reliefs. 

 In G.R. No. 238875, petitioners-senators argue that, as a treaty that 
the Philippines validly entered into, the Rome Statute "has the same 
status as an enactment of Congress,"
[29]
 as "a law in the Philippines."
[30]
 They claim that the 
President "cannot repeal a law."
[31]
 They aver that the country's withdrawal from a 
treaty requires the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the 
Senate.
[32]

 In G.R. No. 239483, petitioner Philippine Coalition for the 
International Criminal Court and its members assert that their rights to
 life, personal security, and dignity were impaired by the withdrawal 
from the Rome Statute.
[33]
 
Citing a decision of the South African High Court, they also claim that 
the ratification of and withdrawal from a multilateral treaty require 
the Senate's concurrence.
[34]
 
According to them, contrary to the President's assertion, the Rome 
Statute is effective in Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of the 
Constitution's incorporation clause, despite lack of publication.
[35]
 
Petitioners pray that the notification of withdrawal be declared 
"invalid or ineffective"
[36]
 or "void 
ab initio
"
[37]

 and that the executive, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
the Philippine Permanent Mission to the United Nations, be required to 
notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the notice is 
cancelled, revoked, or withdrawn.
[38]
 Respondents, through the 
Office of the Solicitor General, counter that the petitioners in G.R. 
No. 238875 do not have 
locus standi 
as they do not 
represent "the official stand of the Senate as a body."
[39]

 Neither do the petitioners in G.R. No. 239483 have standing to question
 "the wisdom of the President's sovereign power to withdraw from the 
Rome Statute, absent any proof of actual or immediate danger of 
sustaining a direct injury as a result of said withdrawal."
[40]

 Respondents claim that a Rule 65 petition is improper because the acts 
of the President complained of were not in the exercise of judicial or 
quasi-judicial powers.
[41]
 
Moreover, mandamus cannot lie against a discretionary act of a 
president, much less an act which is not enjoined as a duty, such as the
 ratification of a treaty.
[42]

 They posit that the Petitions do not present a justiciable controversy 
because the withdrawal from a treaty is a political question, being a 
policy determination delegated to the "wisdom of the executive."
[43]

 Specifically, the President is the "sole organ of the nation in its 
external relations, and its sole representative with foreign 
nations."
[44]
 
Respondents assert that the Constitution does not expressly require 
Senate concurrence in withdrawing from a treaty.
[45]

 Respondents maintain that the withdrawal was valid for having complied 
with the Rome Statute, which requires only a written notification of 
withdrawal.
[46]
 
Respondents also allege that the decision to withdraw from the Rome 
Statute "was an act to protect national sovereignty from interference 
and to preserve the judiciary's independence,"
[47]

 which was necessary given Prosecutor Bensouda's preliminary 
examination. This allegedly violates the complementarity principle under
 the Rome Statute.
[48]
 Lastly, respondents aver 
that the rights being protected under the Rome Statute are adequately 
safeguarded by domestic laws.
[49]

 The withdrawal's only effect, they say, is that the "Philippines will 
no longer be under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal 
Court."
[50]
 Respondents pray that the 
consolidated Petitions be denied for lack of merit.
[51]
 For this 
Court's resolution are the following issues:

 First, whether or not petitioners have sufficiently discharged their 
burden of showing that this case is justiciable. Subsumed under this 
issue are the following:
  






1.


Whether or not 
the consolidated Petitions present an actual, justiciable 
controversy;






 


 






2.


Whether or not each of the 
consolidated Petitions were timely filed; 






 


 






3.


Whether or not petitioners 
have the requisite standing to file their respective Petitions; 







 


 






4.


Whether or not the 
consolidated Petitions were filed in violation of the principle of 
hierarchy of courts;






 


 






5.


Whether or not the issues 
raised by the consolidated Petitions pertain to political questions; 
and






 


 






6.


Whether or not petitioners'
 resort to the procedural vehicles of petitions for certiorari and 
mandamus is proper.








Second, whether or not the Philippines' withdrawal from the 
Rome 
Statute through a Note Verbale delivered to the Secretary-General of the
 United Nations is valid, binding, and effectual. This involves the 
following issues:








1.


 
Whether or not
 the Philippines complied with all the requisites for withdrawal from 
the Rome Statute;






 


 






2.


Whether or not 
the executive can unilaterally withdraw from a treaty. This encompasses:
 






 


 


 








a.


 
Whether or not
 the executive had valid grounds to withdraw from the Rome Statute; 







 


 


 








b.


Whether or not withdrawing 
from a treaty requires legislative action; 






 


 


 








c.


Whether or not the 
executive 's withdrawal from the Rome Statute violated any legislative 
act or prerogative; and






 


 


 








d.


Whether or not withdrawing 
from a treaty demands the concurrence of at least two-thirds of all the 
members of the Senate.








Third, whether or not the Philippines' withdrawal from the 
Rome 
Statute places the Philippines in breach of its obligations under 
international law. 


 Lastly, whether or not the Philippines' withdrawal from the 
Rome 
statute will diminish the Filipino people's protection under 
international law; and even if it does, whether or not this is a 
justiciable question. 


I


 Through Article VII, Section 21 of the 
Constitution, the Rome 
Statute, an international instrument, was transformed and made part of 
the law of the land. Entry into the Rome Statute represented the 
Philippines' commitment to the international community to prosecute 
individuals accused of international crimes. Its validity and 
effectivity hinged on the passage of Senate Resolution No. 546, which 
embodied the Senate's concurrence to the Philippines' accession to the 
Rome Statute. 
 Petitioners believe that President 
Duterte's 
unilateral withdrawal from the Rome Statute transgressed legislative 
prerogatives. 
 Ultimately, this Court may only rule 
in an 
appropriate, justiciable controversy raised by a party who suffers from 
direct, substantial, and material injury. Once again, we clarify our 
role within the constitutional order. We take this occasion to emphasize
 the need for this Court to exercise restraint in cases that fail to 
properly present justiciable controversies, brought by parties who fail 
to demonstrate their standing. This is especially true when our 
pronouncements will cause confusion in the diplomatic sphere and 
undermine our international standing and repute. 
 
Petitioners are
 before us through the vehicles of petitions for certiorari and mandamus
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, praying that the Philippine Notice
 of Withdrawal be declared void
 ab initio
, and that 
the withdrawal itself be declared invalid. They also pray for a writ of 

mandamus

 to direct the Executive Secretary to recall and revoke the Notice of 
Withdrawal, and to submit the issue before the Senate for its 
deliberation.
[52]


 These Petitions fail on significant procedural 
grounds. 

 It is true that this Court, in the exercise of its judicial power, can 
craft a framework to interpret Article VII, Section 21 of the 
Constitution and determine the extent to which Senate concurrence in 
treaty withdrawal is imperative. However, it will be excessive for any 
such framework to be imposed on the circumstances surrounding these 
present Petitions, seeing as how the incidents here are 
fait 
accompli
. 

 Petitioners insist that the protection of human rights will be 
weakened, yet their contentions are mere surmises. Ample protection for 
human rights within the domestic sphere remain formally in place. It is a
 canon of adjudication that "the court should not form a rule of 
constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to 
which it is applied."
[53]

 Contrary to petitioners' claim, these cases do not deal with the 
results of the ongoing preliminary examination by Prosecutor Bensouda. 
Article 127 of the Rome Statute covers that.
[54]

 Neither at issue here is whether a future president may decide to 
re-enter the Rome Statute and secure the requisite Senate concurrence. 
It is possible that whatever the results in these cases are, a future 
administration under a new president can make that decision. 

 
Petitioners want a different political result from what the President 
has done, and so they implore this Court to veto his action, raising 
serious policy implications in so doing. This Court must exercise 
restraint in the face of political posturing, and must anchor its 
determinations not on political results, but on principles and the text 
found in the Constitution and law. The most basic of these principles 
are parameters that determine the justiciability of cases. Judicial 
office impels capacity to rule in keeping with what the Constitution or 
law mandates, even when potentially contrary to what a magistrate may 
prefer politically. 
 
II


 To understand the implications of these cases, a 
brief overview of the Rome Statute is necessary. 

 On July 17, 1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
was adopted in a conference participated in by 120 states.
[55]
 It created the 
International Criminal Court, a permanent autonomous institution,
[56]

 that was given jurisdiction to "investigate, prosecute, and try" 
individuals accused of international crimes of genocide, crimes against 
humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression.
[57]


 On the heels of World War I, during the 1919 Paris
 Peace 
Conference, an international tribunal that will prosecute leaders 
accused of international crimes was first proposed in modern times. In 
1937, the League of Nations held a conference in Geneva, where 13 states
 signed the first convention aiming to establish a permanent 
international court. However, none of the states ratified it and its 
aims failed to materialize.
[58]


 Following World War II and the Axis Powers' 
aggressive military campaigns
[59]
 in Europe and Asia,
[60]
 the allied powers established ad 
hoc tribunals to try Axis leaders accused of international 
crimes.
[61]

 Consequently, a draft of the charter of an international tribunal was 
prepared in a meeting in London among representatives from France, the 
United Kingdom, the United States, and the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics. On August 8, 1945, the London Agreement was signed. It 
established the Nuremburg International Military Tribunal.
[62]
 The tribunal sat in 
Nuremberg, Germany and tried the most notorious Nazi war 
criminals.
[63]
 Its
 jurisdiction was limited to crimes against peace, war crimes, and 
crimes against humanity.
[64]
 Nineteen other states subsequently supported 
the London Agreement.
[65]

 In January 1946, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General 
Douglas MacArthur, established the International Military Tribunal for 
the Far East, more commonly known as the Tokyo International Military 
Tribunal.
[66]
 The 
Tokyo Trial was conducted from May 3, 1946 to November 12, 1948.
[67]
 
Upon termination of their respective trials, the Nuremburg and Tokyo 
International Military Tribunals also ceased to operate.
[68]

 The United Nations General Assembly later put to task the International
 Law Commission, a committee of legal experts who worked for the 
development and codification of international law. The commission was 
asked to look into the possibility of establishing a permanent 
international criminal court. Drafts were subsequently produced, but the
 Cold War impeded its progress.
[69]


 As work continued on the draft, the United Nations 
Security 
Council established two more ad hoc tribunals in the early 1990s. To 
address large-scale atrocities involving the Yugoslavian wars of 
dissolution and the Rwandan genocide of 1994,
[70]

 the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda were established. These 
temporary tribunals underscored the need for a permanent international 
court. 

 In 1994, the International Law Commission submitted a
 proposal 
to the United Nations General Assembly, creating a permanent 
international criminal court.
[71]
 The year after, a Preparatory Committee was 
convened.
[72]

 In April 1998, the amended draft treaty was presented to the United 
Nations General Assembly, and the Rome Conference commenced in June 
1998.
[73]
 On July 17, 1998, 120 states
 voted in favor of the draft treaty, resulting in its adoption.
[74]
 On
 July 1, 2002, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
entered into force upon ratification by 60 states.
[75]
 This formally constituted the 
International Criminal Court.

 The International Criminal Court has an 
international legal personality,
[76]
 and sits at The Hague in the 
Netherlands.
[77]

 It may exercise its functions and powers "on the territory of any 
[s]tate [p]arty and, by special agreement, on the territory of any other
 [s]tate."
[78]


State parties to the Rome Statute recognize the 
jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over the following: 

ARTICLE 5


Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court




 1. The jurisdiction of the Court shall be limited to the 
most 
serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole. The
 Court has jurisdiction in accordance with this Statute with respect to 
the following crimes: 








(a)


The crime of 
genocide;






 


 






(b)


Crimes against humanity; 







 


 






(c)


War crimes; 







 


 






(d)


The crime of aggression. 











The International Criminal Court's jurisdiction is 
"complementary to national criminal jurisdictions."
[79]

 Complementarity means that the International Criminal Court may only 
exercise jurisdiction if domestic courts were "unwilling or unable" to 
prosecute.
[80]
 
Article 17 of the Rome Statute contemplates these situations: 




 2. In order to determine 
unwillingness
 in
 a particular 
case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the principles of due 
process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the 
following exist, as applicable: 








(a)


The proceedings
 were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made 

for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal
 responsibility
 for crimes within the jurisdiction of the 
Court referred to in article 5; 






 


 






(b)


There has been an 

unjustified delay in the proceedings
 which in the 
circumstances is 
inconsistent with an intent to bring the 
person concerned to justice
;






 


 






(c)


The 
proceedings 
were not or are not being conducted independently or 
impartially
,
 and they were or are being conducted in a manner which, in the 
circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person 
concerned to justice. 








 3. In order to determine
 inability
 in a 
particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a 

total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national
 judicial system
,
 the State is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and
 testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings. (Emphasis 
supplied) 




 The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over natural
 persons. Criminal liability shall attach to one who: 







(a)


Commits such a 
crime, whether
 as an individual, jointly with another or through another person, 
regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible; 







 


 






(b)


Orders, solicits 
or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is 
attempted;






 


 






(c)


 
For the purpose 
of 
facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise 
assists in its commission or its attempted commission, including 
providing the means for its commission;






 


 






(d)


 
In any other way
 contributes
 to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group of
 persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be 
intentional and shall either:






 


 


 








i.


Be made with the 
aim of 
furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group, where
 such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the 
jurisdiction of the Court; or






 


 


 








ii.


Be made in the knowledge of 
the intention of the group to commit the crime;






 


 






(e)


 
In respect of 
the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit 
genocide;






 


 






(f)


 
Attempts to 
commit such a 
crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a 
substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances 
independent of the person's intentions. However, a person who abandons 
the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents the completion of 
the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the 
attempt to commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily 
gave up the criminal purpose.
[81]
 








 Individual criminal responsibility under the Rome Statute does
 not affect state responsibility in international law.
[82]
 Further, the Rome 
Statute provides additional grounds of criminal responsibility for 
commanders and other superiors.
[83]
 


 In determining liability under the Rome Statute, a person's 
official capacity is irrelevant: 







1.


This Statute 
shall apply 
equally to all persons without any distinction based on official 
capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or 
Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected 
representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person
 from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, in and 
of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of 
sentence.






 


 






2.


 
Immunities or special 
procedural rules 
which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under 
national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising 
its jurisdiction over such a person.
[84]








 The Rome Statute provides that state parties are obliged to 
give their 
full cooperation
 toward the International 
Criminal Court's investigation and prosecution of crimes within its 
jurisdiction.
[85]

 The International Criminal Court may request, "through the diplomatic 
channel or any other appropriate channel as may be designated by each 
State Party upon ratification, acceptance, approval or accession," state
 parties to cooperate.
[86]
 It 
may employ measures to "ensure the safety or physical or psychological 
well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their 
families."
[87]


 The International Criminal Court may also ask for cooperation 
and 
assistance from any intergovernmental organization pursuant to an 
agreement with the organization and in accordance with its competence 
and mandate.
[88]
 
State parties
 are required to ensure that their national law provides a procedure 
"for all of the forms of cooperation" specified in Part 9 of the 
treaty.
[89]

 A state party's failure to comply with the International Criminal 
Court's request to cooperate would warrant the International Criminal 
Court's finding to that effect. It will then "refer the matter to the 
Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council referred the 
matter to the International Criminal Court, to the Security 
Council."
[90]

 The Assembly of States Parties is the International Criminal Court's 
management oversight and legislative body, comprised of representatives 
of all the states that ratified and acceded to the Rome Statute.
[91]


 Upon a finding of conviction, the International 
Criminal Court may impose any of the following penalties:









(a)


 
Imprisonment 
for a specified number of years, which may not exceed a maximum of 30 
years; or






(b)


A term of life imprisonment
 when 
justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual 
circumstances of the convicted person. 








2. In addition to imprisonment, the Court may order: 









(a)


 
A fine under 
the criteria provided for in the Rules of Procedure and 
Evidence;






(b)


A forfeiture of proceeds, 
property and 
assets derived directly or indirectly from that crime, without prejudice
 to the rights of bona fide third parties. 
[92]
 










All disputes involving the International Criminal Court's 
judicial functions are settled by its decision.
[93]

 Disputes of at least two state parties which relate to the application 
of the Rome Statute, and which are unsettled by "negotiations within 
three months of their commencement, shall be referred to the Assembly of
 States Parties." The Assembly may "settle the dispute or may make 
recommendations on further means of settlement of the dispute."
[94]


 Article 127 of the Rome Statute provides mechanisms on how a 
state party may withdraw from it:



 1. A State Party may, by written notification addressed to 
the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, withdraw from this Statute. The
 withdrawal shall take effect one year after the date of receipt of the 
notification, unless the notification specifies a later date. 


 2. A State shall not be discharged, by reason of its 
withdrawal, 
from the obligations arising from this Statute while it was a Party to 
the Statute, including any financial obligations which may have accrued.
 Its withdrawal shall not affect any cooperation with the Court in 
connection with criminal investigations and proceedings in relation to 
which the withdrawing State had a duty to cooperate and which were 
commenced prior to the date on which the withdrawal became effective, 
nor shall it prejudice in any way the continued consideration of any 
matter which was already under consideration by the Court prior to the 
date on which the withdrawal became effective. 




 Burundi is, thus far, the only other state party to withdraw 
from 
the Rome Statute. In accordance with Article 127(1) of the Rome Statute,
 it sent a written notification of withdrawal to the Secretary-General 
of the International Criminal Court on October 27, 2016. Burundi's 
withdrawal was effected on October 26, 2017.
[95]

 Following Burundi, South Africa, Gambia, and the Philippines manifested
 their intent to withdraw. Nonetheless, Gambia and South Africa 
rescinded their notifications of withdrawal on February 10, 2017 and 
March 7, 2017, respectively.
[96]
 


III


  On March 24, 1998, President Ramos issued 
Administrative Order 
No. 387, which created a task force on the proposed establishment of the
 International Criminal Court. The task force was composed of the 
following: 







Department of 
Foreign Affairs 


Chairman






 


 






Department of 
Justice


 
Co-Chairman 







 


 






Office of the Solicitor 
General


 
Member






 


 






Office of the Executive 
Secretary/(Office of the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel) 



Member 







 


 






Department of Interior and 
Local Government 


Member






 


 






University of the 
Philippines
 
        College of Law 


Member
[97]










The task force had the following duties: 


 Undertake studies and researches pertaining to the 
proposed establishment of the International Criminal 
Court;
 Formulate policy recommendations to serve as
 inputs in the review
 and consolidation of the Philippine Government's position in the 
Preparatory Committee meetings of the ICC and the United Nations General
 Assembly;
Identify and recommend legislative 
measures necessary in the furtherance of the 
foregoing;
Serve as a forum for the resolution of 
issues and concerns pertaining to the establishment of the 
ICC;
Pursue other related functions which may be 
deemed necessary by the President.
[98]
 


 From June 15, 1998 to July 17, 1998, the Philippines 
participated in
 the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the 
Establishment of an International Criminal Court in Rome. Then Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary Lauro L. Baja, the Philippine Head of 
Delegation,
[99]

 delivered a speech that explained the country's position, commitment, 
and historical participation on the establishment of the International 
Criminal Court. His points are summarized, as follows: 



 7. Mr. Baja (Philippines) said that his country aspired to 
the 
establishment of an international criminal court that would dispense 
justice efficiently and effectively; an institution that was ineffective
 in addressing the problem of impunity of the perpetrators of the most 
heinous violations of the laws of humanity would not serve justice or 
help to maintain international peace and security. 
The position
 of the Philippines, consistent with its constitutional and legal 
traditions
, was based on those considerations and on its 
desire to uphold the current evolution of international law. 


 8. National judicial systems should have primacy in trying 
crimes 
and punishing the guilty. The International Criminal Court should 
complement those systems and seek action only when national institutions
 did not exist, could not function or were otherwise unavailable. The 
Court should have jurisdiction over the core crimes of genocide, war 
crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression, but its Statute should 
contain an additional provision allowing for the future inclusion of 
other crimes that affect the very fabric of the international system. 



 9. The Prosecutor should be independent and be entitled to 
investigate complaints 
proprio motu
,
 subject to the safeguards provided by a supervisory pre-trial chamber. 
The use of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, must 
be considered a war crime. The definition of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity should include special consideration of the interests 
of minors and of gender sensitivity. The Statute should provide for an 
age below which there was exemption from criminal responsibility, and 
persons under 18 years of age should not be recruited into the armed 
forces. The sexual abuse of women committed as an act of war or in a way
 that constituted a crime against humanity should be deemed particularly
 reprehensible. The crime of rape should be gender-neutral and 
classified as a crime against persons. A schedule of penalties should be
 prescribed for each core crime defined in the Statute, following the 
principle that there was no crime if there was no penalty, which would 
also meet the due process requirement that the accused should be fully 
apprised of the charges against them and of the penalties attaching to 
the alleged crimes. 


 10. The Philippines supported the positions set out by the 
States 
members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the Ministerial 
Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Movement of Non-Aligned 
Countries, held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in May 1998, 

and was prepared to make the necessary changes to its national 
laws required by the establishment of the Court
.
[100]
 (Emphasis supplied) 





 In the same conference, the Philippines, through its Alternate
 Head of Delegation, Hon. Franklin M. Ebdalin,
[101]
 voted to adopt the Rome Statute, 
and explained its vote: 



 [T]he Statute contained the vital elements of an 
international 
criminal court, with jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity
 and war crimes, gender-based and sex-related crimes and acts committed 
in non-international armed conflicts. 
The Prosecutor could 
initiate proceedings proprio motu, independently of the Security 
Council
. 


 22. The restrictions on admissibility had been reduced to an
 
acceptable minimum. The principle of complementarity was assured, giving
 due regard to the national jurisdiction and sovereignty of States 
parties. 
Finally, there were provisions for restitution, 
compensation and rehabilitation for victims
. 


 23. On the other hand, some provisions detracted from those 
strengths. Some new definitions of war crimes constituted a retrograde 
step in the development of international law. The applicability of the 
aggression provisions had been postponed pending specific definition of 
the crime, and States parties had the option of reservations on the 
applicability of war crimes provisions. Finally, the Security Council 
could seek deferral of prosecution for a one-year period, renewable for 
an apparently unlimited number of times. 


 
24. Nevertheless, he was confident that the 
International 
Criminal Court could succeed with the support of the international 
community and had therefore decided to vote in favour of the 
Statute.
[102]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 On December 28, 2000, the Philippines
[103]
 signed the Rome Statute. However, 
it was still "subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by 
signatory [s]tates."
[104]
 It was also necessary that instruments of 
ratification be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations.
[105]



 Later, Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr., Representative Loretta Ann 
Rosales, the Philippine Coalition for the Establishment of the 
International Criminal Court, the Task Force Detainees of the 
Philippines, and the Families of Victims of Involuntary Disappearances, 
among others, filed a petition for mandamus before this Court to compel 
the Office of the Executive Secretary and the Department of Foreign 
Affairs to transmit the signed copy of the Rome Statute to the Senate 
for its concurrence.
[106]
 Their 	petition 	was 	
dismissed. 	In 	
Pimentel, 	Jr.	v.	Executive


Secretary
,
[107]

 this Court noted that it was beyond its "jurisdiction to compel the 
executive branch of the government to transmit the signed text of the 
Rome Statute to the Senate."
[108]
 
Pimentel Jr
. quoted Justice
 Isagani A. Cruz, who had earlier explained the following concerning the
 treaty-making process:



 The usual steps in the treaty-making process are: 
negotiation, 
signature, ratification, and exchange of the instruments of 
ratification. The treaty may then be submitted for registration and 
publication under the U.N. Charter, although this step is not essential 
to the validity of the agreement as between the parties. 


 
Negotiation
 may be undertaken directly by
 the head of state
 but he now usually assigns this task to his authorized representatives.
 These representatives are provided with credentials known as full 
powers, which they exhibit to the other negotiators at the start of the 
formal discussions. It is standard practice for one of the parties to 
submit a draft of the proposed treaty which, together with the 
counter-proposals, becomes the basis of the subsequent negotiations. The
 negotiations may be brief or protracted, depending on the issues 
involved, and may even "collapse" in case the parties are unable to come
 to an agreement on the points under consideration. 


 If and when the negotiators finally decide on the terms of 
the treaty, the same is opened for 
signature
.
 This step is primarily intended as a means of authenticating the 
instrument and for the purpose of symbolizing the good faith of the 
parties; but, significantly, 
it does not indicate the final 
consent of the state in cases where ratification of the treaty is 
required
. The document is ordinarily signed in accordance with
 the 
alternat
, that is, each of the several 
negotiators is allowed to sign first on the copy which he will bring 
home to his own state. 


 
Ratification
, which is the next step, is 
the formal act by 
which a state confirms and accepts the provisions of a treaty concluded 
by its representatives. 
The purpose of ratification is to 
enable the 
contracting states to examine the treaty more closely and to give them 
an opportunity to refuse to be bound by it should they find it inimical 
to their interests. It is for this reason that most treaties are made 
subject to the scrutiny and consent of a department of the government 
other than that which negotiated them
. 


 . . . .


 The last step in the treaty-making process is the 

exchange of the instruments of ratification
,
 which usually also signifies the effectivity of the treaty unless a 
different date has been agreed upon by the parties. Where ratification 
is dispensed with and no effectivity clause is embodied in the treaty, 
the instrument is deemed effective upon its signature.
[109]
 (Emphasis in the 
original)




 This Court declared that submission to ratification is 
"generally held to be an executive act,"
[110]

 and it binds the state to the signed statute. It concluded that upon 
signature through a representative, the president exercises discretion 
on whether to ratify the statute or not: 



 After the treaty is signed by the state's representative, 
the 
President, being accountable to the people, is burdened with the 
responsibility and the duty to carefully study the contents of the 
treaty and ensure that they are not inimical to the interest of the 
state and its people. Thus, the President has the discretion even after 
the signing of the treaty by the Philippine representative whether or 
not to ratify the same. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 
does not contemplate to defeat or even restrain this power of the head 
of states. If that were so, the requirement of ratification of treaties 
would be pointless and futile. It has been held that a state has no 
legal or even moral duty to ratify a treaty which has been signed by its
 plenipotentiaries. There is no legal obligation to ratify a treaty, but
 it goes without saying that the refusal must be based on substantial 
grounds and not on superficial or whimsical reasons. Otherwise, the 
other state would be justified in taking offense. 


 It should be emphasized that under our Constitution, the 
power to 
ratify is vested in the President, subject to the concurrence of the 
Senate. The role of the Senate, however, is limited only to giving or 
withholding its consent, or concurrence, to the ratification. Hence, it 
is within the authority of the President to refuse to submit a treaty to
 the Senate or, having secured its consent for its ratification, refuse 
to ratify it. Although the refusal of a state to ratify a treaty which 
has been signed in its behalf is a serious step that should not be taken
 lightly, such decision is within the competence of the President alone,
 which cannot be encroached by this Court 
via
 a writ 
of 
mandamus
. This Court has no jurisdiction over 
actions seeking to enjoin the President in the performance of his 
official duties.
[111]

 In 2009, President Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law Republic 
Act No.
 9851, which replicated many of the then unratified Rome Statute's 
provisions.
 Some provisions, however, are 
significantly 
different. In some aspects, the law went beyond the Rome Statute. It 
broadened the definition of torture, added the conscription of child 
soldiers as a war crime,
[112]
 and stipulated jurisdiction over crimes 
against humanity anywhere in the world, as long as the offender or 
victim is Filipino.
[113]

 This removes complementarity as a requirement for prosecution of crimes
 against humanity under the ratified treaty. While the treaty's language
 had to be refined to take the interests of other countries into 
consideration,
[114]
 the law 
was independently passed considering all our interests. This 
independent, voluntary initiative strengthened our own criminal justice 
system.
 On February 28, 2011, President Aquino sent 
the signed Rome Statute to the Senate for concurrence.
[115]
 On August 23, 2011, 
the Senate passed Resolution No. 546, which embodied the country's 
accession to the Rome Statute.
[116]

 On August 30, 2011, the Philippines deposited its instrument of 
ratification to the United Nations Secretary-General. Thus, the Rome 
Statute took effect in the Philippines on November 1, 2011.
[117]
IV


 The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Vienna
 Convention)
 defines treaties as "international agreement[s] concluded between 
states in written form and governed by international law, whether 
embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments 
and whatever its particular designation."
[118]

 In our jurisdiction, we characterize treaties as "international 
agreements entered into by the Philippines which require legislative 
concurrence after executive ratification. This term may include compacts
 like conventions, declarations, covenants and acts."
[119]

 Treaties under the Vienna Convention include all written international 
agreements, regardless of their nomenclature. In international law, no 
difference exists in the agreements' binding effect on states, 
notwithstanding how nations opt to designate the 
document.
 However, Philippine law distinguishes 
treaties from executive agreements.


V


 Treaties and executive agreements are equally 
binding on the 
Philippines. However, an executive agreement: "(a) does not require 
legislative concurrence; (b) is usually less formal; and (c) deals with a
 narrower range of subject matters."
[120]
 Executive agreements dispense with Senate 
concurrence "because of the legal mandate with which they are 
concluded."
[121]
 
They simply 
implement
 existing policies, and are thus
 entered into:







(1)


to adjust the 
details of a treaty; 






 


 






(2)


 
pursuant to or upon 
confirmation by an act of the Legislature; or






 


 






(3)


 
in the exercise of the 
President's independent powers under the 
Constitution.






 The 
raison d'Ãªtre of executive 
agreements hinges on prior constitutional or legislative 
authorizations
.
[122]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations 
omitted)




 However, this Court had previously stated that this difference
 in form is immaterial in international law:



 The special nature of an executive agreement is not just a 
domestic variation in international agreements. International practice 
has accepted the use of various forms and designations of international 
agreements, ranging from the traditional notion of a treaty â which 
connotes a formal, solemn instrument â to engagements concluded in 
modem, simplified forms that no longer necessitate ratification. An 
international agreement may take different forms: treaty, act, protocol,
 agreement, 
concordat
, 
compromis 
d'arbitrage
, convention, covenant, declaration, exchange of 
notes, statute, pact, charter, agreed minute, memorandum of agreement, 

modus vivendi
,
 or some other form. Consequently, under international law, the 
distinction between a treaty and an international agreement or even an 
executive agreement is irrelevant for purposes of determining 
international rights and obligations.

 This Court also cautioned that this local affectation does not
 mean 
that the constitutionally required 	Senate concurrence may 	be 	
conveniently disregarded:



 However, this principle does not mean that the domestic law 
distinguishing 
treaties, international agreements
, 
and 
executive agreements

 is relegated to a mere variation in form, or that the constitutional 
requirement of Senate concurrence is demoted to an optional 
constitutional directive. There remain two very important features that 
distinguish 
treaties from executive agreements
 and 
translate them into terms of art in the domestic setting. 


 
First
, executive agreements must remain 
traceable to an 
express or implied authorization under the Constitution, statutes, or 
treaties. The absence of these precedents puts the validity and 
effectivity of executive agreements under serious question for the main 
function of the Executive is to enforce the Constitution and the laws 
enacted by the Legislature, not to defeat or interfere in the 
performance of these rules. In turn, executive agreements cannot create 
new international obligations that are not expressly allowed or 
reasonably implied in the law they purport to implement. 


 
Second
, treaties are, by their very 
nature, considered 
superior to executive agreements. Treaties are products of the acts of 
the Executive and the Senate unlike executive agreements, which are 
solely executive actions. Because of legislative participation through 
the Senate, a treaty is regarded as being on the same level as a 
statute. If there is an irreconcilable conflict, a later law or treaty 
takes precedence over one that is prior. An executive agreement is 
treated differently. Executive agreements that are inconsistent with 
either a law or a treaty are considered ineffective.
 Both types
 of international agreement are nevertheless subject to the supremacy of
 the
 Constitution.


 This rule does not imply, though, that the President is 
given 
carte blanche
 to exercise this discretion. 
Although the Chief Executive wields the exclusive authority to conduct 
our foreign relations, 
this
 power must still be exercised within the context and the parameters set
 by the Constitution, as well as by existing domestic and international 
laws[.]
[124]
  (Emphasis supplied, citations 
omitted)




 International agreements
[125]

 fall under these two general categories, and are outlined in Executive 
Order No. 459, which provides guidelines on how these agreements enter 
into force in the domestic sphere.
[126]


VI


 Though both are sources of international law, 
treaties must be 
distinguished from generally accepted principles of international law. 

 Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court
 of Justice enumerates the sources of international law:
[127]




 a. international conventions, whether general or particular,
 establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states; 



 b. international custom, as evidence of a general practice 
accepted as law; 


 c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized 
nations; 


 d. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial 
decisions and
 the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various 
nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law. 





 Two constitutional provisions incorporate or transform 
portions of 
international law into the domestic sphere, namely: (1) Article II, 
Section 2, which embodies the 
incorporation method
; 
and (2) Article VII, Section 21, which covers 
the 
transformation method
. They state: 
 
ARTICLE II
 
Declaration 
of Principles and State Policies 
Principles



 . . . .


 SECTION 2. The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of
 national policy, 
adopts the generally accepted 
principles of international law as part of the law of the 
land
 and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, 
justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations. 


 
ARTICLE VII
 
    Executive Department


 . . . .


 SECTION 21. No treaty or international agreement 

shall be valid and effective
 
unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the 
Senate. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The sources of international lawâinternational conventions, 
international custom, general principles of law, and judicial 
decisionsâare treated differently in our jurisdiction. 

 Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution declares 
that international custom and general principles of law are adopted 

as part of the law of the land
. No further act is 
necessary to facilitate this: 



 "Generally accepted principles of international law" refers 
to 
norms of general or customary international law which are binding on all
 states, 
i.e
., renunciation of war as an instrument 
of national 
policy, the principle of sovereign immunity, a person's right to life, 
liberty and due process, and 
pacta sunt servanda
, 
among others. The concept of "generally accepted principles of law" has 
also been depicted in this wise: 




 Some legal scholars and judges look upon certain "general 
principles of law" as a primary source of international law because 

they have the "character of jus rationale" and are "valid 
through all kinds of human societies.
" O'Connell holds that 
certain principles are part of international law because 
they 
are "basic to legal systems generally" and hence part of the jus 
gentium
.
 These principles, he believes, are established by a process of 
reasoning based on the common identity of all legal systems. If there 
should be doubt or disagreement, one must look to state practice and 
determine whether the municipal law principle provides a just and 
acceptable solution.
[128]
 (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied) 







 In his separate opinion in 
Government of the United 
States of America v. Purganan
,
[129]

 Justice Jose C. Vitug (Justice Vitug) underscored that as a source of 
international law, general principles of law are only secondary to 
international conventions 
and
 international customs. 
He stressed that while international conventions and customs are "based 
on the consent of nations,"
[130]
 general principles of law have yet to have a 
binding definition:
[131]




 Article 38 (1) (c) is identified as being a "secondary 
source" of 
international law and, therefore, not ranked at par with treaties and 
customary international law. The phrase is innately vague; and its exact
 meaning still eludes any general consensus. The widely preferred 
opinion, however, appears to be that of Oppenheim which views "general 
principles of law" as being inclusive of principles of private or 
municipal law when these are applicable to international relations. 
Where, in certain cases, there is no applicable treaty nor a generality 
of state practice giving rise to customary law, the international court 
is expected to rely upon certain legal notions of justice and equity in 
order to deduce a new rule for application to a novel situation. This 
reliance or "borrowing" by the international tribunal from general 
principles of municipal jurisprudence is explained in many ways by the 
fact that municipal or private law has a higher level of development 
compared to international law. Brownlie submits that the term 
"generally-accepted principles of international law" could also refer to
 rules of customary law, to general principles of law, or to logical 
propositions resulting from judicial reasoning on the basis of existing 
international law and municipal law analogies. 


 
In order to qualify as a product of the subsidiary 
law-creating
 process, a principle of law must fulfill three requirements: (1) it 
must be a general principle of law as distinct from a legal rule of more
 limited functional scope, (2) it must be recognized by civilized 
nations, and (3) it must be shared by a fair number of states in the 
community of nations.


 ....


 Clarifying the term "generally-accepted principles of 
international law" during the deliberations of the 1987 Constitutional 
Commission, Commissioner Adolfo S. Azcuna points out that "when we talk 
of 
generally-accepted principles of international 
law
 as part of the law of the land, we mean that it 

is part of the statutory part of laws, not of the 
Constitution.["]
 


 The remark is shared by Professor Merlin M. Magallona who 
expresses that the phrase "as part of the law of the land" in the 
incorporation clause refers to the levels of legal rules below the 
Constitution such as legislative acts and judicial decisions. 	Thus, he 
contends, it is incorrect to so interpret this phrase as including the 
Constitution itself because it would mean that the "generally-accepted 
principles of international law" falls in parity with the 
Constitution.
[132]

 In 
Rubrico v. Arroyo
,
[133]

 Justice Conchita Carpio Morales (Justice  Carpio Morales) refined 
Justice Vitug's proposed framework. She conceded that the Constitution's
 mention of generally accepted principles of international law was "not 
quite the same" as, and was 
not
 specifically included
 in Article 38's "general principles of law recognized by civilized 
nations[.]"
[134]
 
Yet, she noted:



 Renowned publicist Ian Brownlie suggested, however, that 
"general principles of international law" 
may
 refer to rules of customary law, to general principles of law as in 
Article 38 (1) (c), or to logical propositions resulting from judicial 
reasoning
 on the basis of existing international law and 
municipal analogies. 


 Indeed, 
judicial reasoning
 has 
been the bedrock of 
Philippine jurisprudence on the determination of generally accepted 
principles of international law and consequent application of the 
incorporation clause
. 


 In 
Kuroda v. Jalandoni
, the Court held 
that while the 
Philippines was not a signatory to the Hague Convention and became a 
signatory to the Geneva Convention only in 1947, a Philippine Military 
Commission had jurisdiction over war crimes committed in violation of 
the two conventions before 1947. The Court reasoned that the rules and 
regulations of the Hague and Geneva Conventions formed part of generally
 accepted principles of international law. 
Kuroda
 
thus recognized
 that principles of customary international law do not cease to be so, 
and are in fact reinforced, when codified in multilateral treaties. 



 In 
International School Alliance of Educators v. 
Quisumbing
,
 the Court invalidated as discriminatory the practice of International 
School, Inc. of according foreign hires higher salaries than local 
hires. The Court found that, among other things, there was a general 
principle against discrimination evidenced by a number of international 
conventions proscribing it, which had been incorporated as part of 
national laws through the Constitution. 


 
The Court thus subsumes within the rubric of 
"generally 
accepted principles of  international law" both "international custom" 
and "general principles of law," two distinct sources of international 
law recognized by the ICJ Statute
. 
[135]
  (Citations omitted, emphasis 
supplied) 




 In other words, Justice Carpio Morales opined that, per 
jurisprudence, international customs and general principles of law 
recognized by civilized nations form part of the law of the land. 

 Justice Antonio T. Carpio, in his dissent in 

Bayan Muna v. Romulo
,
[136]
 echoed Justice Carpio Morales's supposition
 and further discussed: 



 [T]he doctrine of incorporation which mandates that the 
Philippines is bound by generally accepted principles of international 
law which automatically form part of Philippine law by operation of the 
Constitution. 


 In 
Kuroda v. Jalandoni
, this Court held 
that this 
constitutional provision "is not confined to the recognition of rules 
and principles of international law as contained in treaties to which 
our government may have been or shall be a signatory." The pertinent 
portion of Kuroda states: 




 
It cannot be denied that the rules and 
regulations of
 
The
 Hague and Geneva Conventions form part of and are wholly based on the 
generally accepted principles of international law. . . . Such rule and 
principles, therefore, form part of the law of our nation even if the 
Philippines was not a signatory to the conventions embodying 
them
, 
for our Constitution has been deliberately general and extensive in its 
scope and is not confined to the recognition of rules and principles of 
international law as contained in treaties to which our government may 
have been or shall be a signatory. 




 Hence, generally accepted principles of international law 
form 
part of Philippine laws even if they do not derive from treaty 
obligations of the Philippines. 


 
Generally accepted principles of international law,
 as referred to in the Constitution, include customary international 
law.

 Customary international law is one of the primary sources of 
international law under Article 38 of the Statute of the International 
Court of Justice. Customary international law consists of acts which, by
 repetition of States of similar international acts for a number of 
years, occur out of a sense of obligation, and taken by a significant 
number of States. It is based on custom, which is a clear and continuous
 habit of doing certain actions, which has grown under the aegis of the 
conviction that these actions are, according to international law, 
obligatory or right. Thus, customary international law requires the 
concurrence of two elements: "[1] the established, wide-spread, and 
consistent practice on the part of the States; and [2] a psychological 
element known as 
opinion juris sive necessitatis
 
(opinion as to 
law or necessity). Implicit in the latter element is a belief that the 
practice in question is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule 
of law requiring it."
[137]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 





 Thus, generally accepted principles of international law 
include 
international customs and general principles of law. Under the 
incorporation clause, these principles form part of the law of the land.
 And, "by mere constitutional declaration, international law is deemed 
to have the force of domestic law."
[138]
 Pursuant to Article VII, 
Section 21 of the Constitution, treaties become "
valid and 
effective
" upon the Senate's concurrence: 



 The Senate's ratification of a treaty makes it legally 
effective 
and binding by transformation. It then has the force and effect of a 
statute enacted by Congress. In 
Pharmaceutical and Health Care 
Association of the Philippines v. Duque III, et al.: 





 Under the 1987 Constitution, international law can become 
part 
of the sphere of domestic law either by transformation or incorporation.
 
The transformation method requires that an international law 
be transformed
 
into a domestic law through a 
constitutional mechanism such as local legislation
.
 The incorporation method applies when, by mere constitutional 
declaration, international law is deemed to have the force of domestic 
law. 


 
Treaties become part of the law of the land 
through 
transformation pursuant to Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution 
... Thus, treaties or conventional international law must go through a 
process prescribed by the Constitution for it to be transformed into 
municipal law that can be applied to domestic 
conflicts
.
[139]






 As discussed in 
Bayan v. Zamora
,
[140]
 concurring m a 
treaty or international agreement is: 



 . . . essentially legislative in character; the Senate, as 
an 
independent body possessed of its own erudite mind, has the prerogative 
to either accept or reject the proposed agreement, and whatever action 
it takes in the exercise of its wide latitude of discretion, pertains to
 the wisdom rather than the legality of the act.
[141]
 




 Thus, in doing so: 



 . . . the Senate partakes a principal, yet delicate, role in
 
keeping the principles of separation of powers and of checks and 
balances alive and vigilantly ensures that these cherished rudiments 
remain true to their form in a democratic government such as 
ours.
[142]




 However, the provision on treaty-making is under Article VII 
of the 
Constitution, which concerns the executive department. A review of the 
evolution of this constitutional provision may aid this Court in 
interpreting its text. 
 In his concurring opinion in 

Intellectual Property Association of the Philippines v. 
Ochoa
,
[143]
 Justice Arturo D. Brion (Justice Brion) 
discussed the antecedents of the transformation method: 



 Under the 1935 Constitution, 
the President has the 
"power, with the concurrence of a majority of all the members of the 
National Assembly, to make treaties

 . . . ." The provision, Article VII, Section 11, paragraph 7 is part of
 the enumeration of the President's powers under Section 11, Article VII
 of the 1935 Constitution. This recognition clearly marked treaty 	
making to be 	an executive function, but	its exercise was nevertheless 
subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly.  A subsequent 
amendment to the 1935 Constitution, which divided the country's 
legislative branch into two houses, transferred the function of treaty 
concurrence to the Senate, and required that two-thirds of its members 
assent to the treaty. 


 By 1973, the Philippines adopted a presidential 
parliamentary 
system of government, which merged some of the functions of the 
Executive and Legislative branches of government in one branch. Despite 
this change, concurrence was still seen as necessary in the 
treaty-making process, as Article VIII, Section 14 required that a 
treaty should be first concurred in by a majority of all Members of the 
Batasang Pambansa before they could be considered valid and effective in
 the Philippines, thus: 




 SEC. 14. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this 
Constitution, 
no treaty shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by a majority
 of all the Members of the Batasang Pambansa. 




 This change in the provision on treaty ratification and 
concurrence is significant for the following reasons: 


 
First
, the change 
clarified the 
effect of  the lack of concurrence to a treaty
, that is, a 
treaty without legislative concurrence shall not be valid and effective 
in the Philippines. 


 Second, the change of wording also reflected the dual nature
 of 
the Philippines' approach in international relations. Under this 
approach, the Philippines sees international law and its international 
obligations from two perspectives: first, from the 

international plane
, where international law reigns 
supreme over national laws; and second, from the 
domestic 
plane
,
 where the international obligations and international customary laws 
are considered in the same footing as national laws, and do not 
necessarily prevail over the latter. The Philippines' treatment of 
international obligations as statutes in its domestic plane also means 
that they cannot contravene the Constitution, including the mandated 
process by which they become effective in Philippine jurisdiction. 



 Thus, while a treaty ratified by the President is binding 
upon the
 Philippines in the international plane, it would need the concurrence 
of the legislature before it can be considered as valid and effective in
 the Philippine domestic jurisdiction. 
Prior to and even 
without 
concurrence, the treaty, once ratified, is valid and binding upon the 
Philippines in the international plane. But in order to take effect in 
the Philippine domestic plane, it would have to first undergo 
legislative concurrence as required under the Constitution
. 



 
Third
, that the provision had been 
couched in the negative 
emphasizes the mandatory nature of legislative concurrence before a 
treaty may be considered valid and effective in the Philippines. 



 The phrasing of Article VIII, Section 14 of the 1973 
Constitution 
has been retained in the 1987 Constitution, except for three changes: 

First
,
 the Batasang Pambansa has been changed to the Senate to reflect the 
current setup of our legislature and our tripartite system of 
government. 
Second
, the vote required has been 
increased to two-thirds, reflective of the practice under the amended 
1935 Constitution. 
Third
, the term 
"
international agreement
"
 has been added, aside from the term treaty.  Thus, aside from treaties,
 "international agreements" now need concurrence before being considered
 as valid and effective in the Philippines.
[144]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations 
omitted) 




 The 1935
[145]
 and 1973
[146]
 Constitutions used the same words as Article 
II, Section 2
[147]

 of the present Constitution does, and adopted "the generally accepted 
principles of international law as part of the law of the land."
[148]
 However, there have 
been significant changes in constitutional provisions on treaty-making. 

 Article VII, Section 10(7) of the 1935 Constitution 
reads: 
 
ARTICLE VII


Executive Department



 SECTION 10. . . . 


 . . . .


 (7) 
The President shall have the power, with the 
concurrence of two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate to make 
treaties
,
 and with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, he shall 
appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. He shall 
receive ambassadors and other public ministers duly accredited to the 
Government of the Philippines. 




 Under the 1935 Constitution, the power to 
make 
treaties
 was 
lodged in the President, subject to the Senate's concurrence. Although 
the 1973 Constitution 	shifted 	our 	system 	of 	government 	from	
presidential 	to parliamentary, its provision on treaty-making still 
required the concurrence of the Batasang Pambansa, the body on which 
legislative power rested: 


ARTICLE VIII
 
Batasang Pambansa



 SECTION 	14. 	(1) Except as otherwise provided 	in this 
Constitution, no treaty 
shall be valid and effective
 
unless concurred in by a majority of all the Members of the Batasang 
Pambansa. (Emphasis supplied) 




 On this note, it has been previously surmised that: 



 The concurrence of the Batasang Pambansa was duly limited to
 treaties. 


 However, the first clause of this provision, "except as 
otherwise 
provided," leaves room for the exception to the requirement of 
legislative concurrence. Under Article XIV, Section 15 of the 1973 
Constitution, requirements of national welfare and interest allow the 
President to enter into not only treaties but also international 
agreements without legislative concurrence, thus: 




 ARTICLE XIV THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE 
PATRIMONY
 OF THE NATION
 xxx xxx xxx







 SECTION 15. Any provision of paragraph one, Section 
fourteen, 
Article Eight and of this Article notwithstanding, the Prime Minister 
may enter into international treaties or agreements as the national 
welfare and interest may require. 






 This Court, in the recent case of 
Saguisag v. 
Executive Secretary
,
 characterized this exception as having "left a large margin of 
discretion that the President could use to bypass the Legislature 
altogether." This Court noted this as "a departure from the 1935 
Constitution, which explicitly gave the President the power to enter 
into treaties only with the concurrence of the National Assembly." 



 As in the 1935 Constitution, this exception is no longer 
present in the current formulation of the provision. 

The power and responsibility to enter into treaties is
 now shared by the executive and legislative 
departments.

 Furthermore, the role of the legislative department is expanded to 
cover not only treaties but international agreements in general as well,
 thus: 




 ARTICLE VII Executive Department 
xxx 
xxx xxx





 SECTION 21. No treaty 
or international 
agreement
 shall be valid and effective unless 
concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate. 





 In discussing the power of the Senate to concur with 
treaties entered into by the President, this Court in 
Bayan v. 
Zamora
 remarked on the significance of this legislative power:
 




 For the role of the Senate in relation to treaties is 
essentially legislative in character; the Senate, as an independent body
 possessed of its own erudite mind, has the prerogative to either accept
 or reject the proposed agreement, and whatever action it takes in the 
exercise of its wide latitude of discretion, pertains to the wisdom 
rather than the legality of the act. 
In this sense, the Senate 
partakes a principal, yet delicate, role in keeping the principles of 

separation of powers
 and of 
checks and 
balances

 alive and vigilantly ensures that these cherished rudiments remain true
 to their form in a democratic government such as ours. The Constitution
 thus animates, through this treaty-concurring power of the Senate, a 
healthy system of checks and balances indispensable toward our nation's 
pursuit of political maturity and growth
. True enough, 
rudimentary 
is the principle that matters pertaining to the wisdom of a legislative 
act are beyond the ambit and province of the courts to inquire. 





 Therefore, having an option does not necessarily mean 
absolute 
discretion on the choice of international agreement. There are certain 
national interest issues and policies covered by all sorts of 
international agreements, which may not be dealt with by the President 
alone. 
An interpretation that the executive has unlimited 
discretion 
to determine if an agreement requires senate concurrence not only runs 
counter to the principle of checks and balances; it may also render the 
constitutional requirement of senate concurrence meaningless
: 





 
If executive-agreement authority is 
un-contained, and if 
what may be the proper subject-matter of a treaty may also be included 
within the scope of executive-agreement power, the constitutional 
requirement of Senate concurrence could be rendered meaningless. The 
requirement could be circumvented by an expedient resort to executive 
agreement.
 


 The definite provision for Senate concurrence in the 
Constitution indomitably signifies that there must be a regime of 
national interests, policies and problems which the Executive branch of 
the government cannot deal with in terms of foreign relations except 
through treaties concurred in by the Senate under Article VII, Section 
21 of the Constitution. The problem is how to define that regime, 

i.e
.,
 that which is outside the scope of executive-agreement power of the 
President and which exclusively belongs to treaty-making as subject to 
Senate concurrence. 




 
Article VII, Section 21 does not limit the
 requirement of 
senate concurrence to treaties alone. It may cover other international 
agreements, including those classified as executive agreements, if: (1) 
they are more permanent in nature; (2) their purposes go beyond the 
executive function of carrying out national policies and traditions; and
 (3) they amend existing treaties or statutes.




 As long as the subject matter of the agreement covers 
political 
issues and national policies of a more permanent character, the 
international agreement must be concurred in by the Senate.
[149]
 (Emphasis supplied, 
citations omitted) 




 The constitutional framers were not linguistically ignorant. 
Treaties follow a different process to become part of the law of the 
land. Their delineation from generally accepted principles of 
international law was deliberate. So was the use of different 
terminologies and mechanisms in rendering them valid and effective. 


 In consonance with the Constitution and existing laws, presidents act 
within their competence when they enter into treaties. However, for 
treaties to be 
effective
 in this jurisdiction, 
Senate concurrence must be obtained. 
The president may not 
engage in foreign relations in direct contravention of the Constitution 
and our laws
: 



 After the treaty is signed by the state's representative, 
the 
President, being accountable to the people, is burdened with the 
responsibility and the duty to carefully study the contents of the 
treaty and ensure that they are not inimical to the interest of the 
state and its people.
[150]




 As explained in 
Pimentel, Jr.
: 



 In our system of government, the President, being the head 
of 
state, is regarded as the sole organ and authority in external relations
 and is the country's sole representative with foreign nations. As the 
chief architect of foreign policy, the President acts as the country's 
mouthpiece with respect to international affairs. Hence, the President 
is vested with the authority to deal with foreign states and 
governments, extend or withhold recognition, maintain diplomatic 
relations, enter into treaties, and otherwise transact the business of 
foreign relations. In the realm of treaty-making, the President has the 
sole authority to negotiate with other states. 


 Nonetheless, while the President has the sole authority to 
negotiate and enter into treaties, 
the
 Constitution 

provides a limitation to his power

 by requiring the concurrence of 2/3 of all the members of the Senate 
for the validity of the treaty entered into by him. . . .  


 . . . .


 
The participation of the legislative branch in the 
treaty-making process was deemed essential to provide a check on the 
executive in the field of foreign relations. By requiring the 
concurrence of the legislature in the treaties entered into by the 
President, the Constitution ensures a healthy system of checks and 
balance necessary in the nation's pursuit of political maturity and 
growth

 The context of the provision in question, alongside others, 
provides
 enlightenment. Under Article VI of the Constitution, legislative power 
is checked by the executive: 



 SECTION 23. (1) The Congress, by a vote of two-thirds of 
both 
Houses in joint session assembled, voting separately, shall have the 
sole power to declare the existence of a state of war. 


 (2) In times of war or other national emergency, the 
Congress may,
 by law, authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to 
such restrictions as it may prescribe, to exercise powers necessary and 
proper to carry out a declared national policy. Unless sooner withdrawn 
by resolution of the Congress, such powers shall cease upon the next 
adjournment thereof. 


 SECTION 28. (1) The rule of taxation shall be uniform and 
equitable. The Congress shall evolve a progressive system of taxation. 



 (2) The Congress may, by law, authorize the President to fix
 
within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and 
restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, 
tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the 
framework of the national development program of the Government. 



 (3) Charitable institutions, churches and parsonages or 
convents 
appurtenant thereto, mosques, non-profit cemeteries, and all lands, 
buildings, and improvements, actually, directly, and exclusively used 
for religious, charitable, or educational purposes shall be exempt from 
taxation. 


 (4) No law granting any tax exemption shall be passed 
without the 
concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress. 




 Conversely, some executive powers under Article VII of the 
Constitution are checked by the legislature, by one of its chambers, by 
legislative committees, or by other bodies attached to the legislature: 



 SECTION 16. The President shall nominate and, 
with 
the consent of the Commission on Appointments
,
 appoint the heads of the executive departments, ambassadors, other 
public ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed forces from the 
rank of colonel or naval captain, and other officers whose appointments 
are vested in him in this Constitution. He shall also appoint all other 
officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided
 for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint. The 
Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of other officers lower in 
rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of 
departments, agencies, commissions, or boards. 


 . . . .


 SECTION 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of
 all 
armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he 
may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, 
invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public
 safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, 
suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the 
Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. Within forty-eight 
hours from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the 
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the President shall submit a 
report in person or in writing 
to the Congress. The Congress, 
voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in 
regular or special session
,
 may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not 
be set aside by the President. Upon the initiative of the President, 

the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation 
or suspension
 for a period to be determined by the Congress, 
if the invasion or rebellion shall persist and public safety requires 
it. 


 The Congress, if not in session, shall, within twenty-four 
hours 
following such proclamation or suspension, convene in accordance with 
its rules without any need of a call. 


 The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding 
filed 
by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation
 of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ or the 
extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within 
thirty days from its filing. 


 . . . .


 SECTION 19. Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise 
provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, 
commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after 
conviction by final judgment. 


 
He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with 
the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the 
Congress
. 


 . . . .


 SECTION 21. No treaty or international agreement shall be 
valid 
and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the 
Members of the Senate. (Emphasis supplied) 




 In sum, treaty-making is a function lodged in the executive 
branch, 
which is headed by the president. Nevertheless, a treaty's effectivity 
depends on the Senate's concurrence, in accordance with the 
Constitution's system of checks and balances. 
 
VII


 While Senate concurrence is expressly required to 
make treaties 
valid and effective, no similar express mechanism concerning withdrawal 
from treaties or international agreements is provided in the 
Constitution or any statute. Similarly, no constitutional or statutory 
provision grants the president the unilateral power to terminate 
treaties. This vacuum engenders the controversy around which the present
 consolidated Petitions revolve. 
 Frameworks 	in	
evaluating 
executive 	action, 	vis-Ã -vis 	legislative prerogatives,	have 	been 	
formulated	in 	other 	jurisdictions. Judicious discernment makes these 
frameworks worthy of consideration. 
 To be clear, 
however, while 
legal principles in a legal system similar to ours may hold persuasive 
value in our courts, we will not adopt such principles without 
considering our own unique cultural, political, and economic contexts. 
The Philippines has long struggled against colonialism. We will not 
betray efforts at evolving our own just but unique modalities for 
judicial review by summarily adopting foreign notions. 

 In 
Goldwater v. Carter
,
[152]

 a case resolved by the United States Supreme Court, certain members of 
Congress assailed then President Jimmy Carter's (President Carter) 
unilateral abrogation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty. 
Relevant events were chronicled in a Yale Law journal article: 



 On December 15, 1978, President Carter announced his 
intention to 
recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic 
of China and to terminate, as of January 1, 1980, the 1954 Mutual 
Defense Treaty between the United States and Taiwan. Seven U.S. Senators
 and eight Members of the House of Representatives sued the President 
and the Secretary of State in the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Columbia. They sought an injunction and a declaration that the 
President's attempt to unilaterally terminate the treaty was 
"unconstitutional, illegal, null and void" unless "made by and with the 
full consultation of the entire Congress, and with either the advice and
 consent of the Senate, or the approval of both Houses of Congress." 



 When the 96th Congress opened, several Senators introduced 
resolutions asserting that the President had encroached on Congress's 
constitutional role with respect to treaty termination generally and the
 Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty in particular. In October 1979, the 
district court held that to be effective under the Constitution, the 
President's notice of termination had to receive the approval of either 
two-thirds of the Senate or a majority of both houses of Congress. 



 A fragmented D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, heard the case 
on an 
expedited basis on November 13 and just seventeen days later ruled for 
the President. Declining to treat the matter as a political question, 
the circuit court instead held on the merits that the President had not 
exceeded his authority in terminating the bilateral treaty in accordance
 with its terms. Pressed to decide the case before the designated 
January 1, 1980 termination date, the Supreme Court issued no majority 
opinion. Instead, in a 6-3 
per curiam
 decision, the
 Court dismissed the complaint without oral argument as 
nonjusticiable.
[153]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Even back in 1979, before the case reached the United States 
Supreme Court, Circuit Court Judge MacKinnon
[154]

 had previously cautioned that a grant of absolute power of unilateral 
termination to the president may be easily used in the future to 
"develop other excuses to feed upon congressional prerogatives that a 
Congress lacking in vigilance allows to lapse into desuetude."
[155]

 The District Court eventually ruled that President Carter did not 
exceed his authority in terminating the bilateral agreement without 
Senate concurrence.
 In a Resolution, the United 
States Supreme 
Court granted the petition for certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals 
judgment, and remanded the case to the District Court, "with directions 
to dismiss the complaint."
[156]

 Four justices observed that there is an "absence of any constitutional 
provision governing the termination of a treaty" and that "different 
termination procedures may be appropriate for different 
treaties."
[157]
 Observations articulated in
 
Goldwater

 reveal stark similarities between the American and the Philippine legal
 systems concerning ensuing debates on the necessity of Senate 
concurrence in abrogating treaties: 



 No constitutional provision explicitly confers upon the 
President 
the power to terminate treaties. Further, Art. II, 2, of the 
Constitution authorizes the President to make treaties with the advice 
and consent of the Senate. Article VI provides that treaties shall be a 
part of the supreme law of the land. These provisions add support to the
 view that 
the text of the Constitution does not unquestionably
 commit the power to terminate treaties to the President 
alone
.... 


 We are asked to decide whether the President may terminate a
 
treaty under the Constitution without congressional approval. Resolution
 of the question may not be easy, but it only requires us to apply 
normal principles of interpretation to the constitutional provisions at 
issue.... The present case involves neither review of the President's 
activities as Commander in Chief nor impermissible interference in the 
field of foreign affairs. Such a case would arise if we were asked to 
decide, for example, whether a treaty required the President to order 
troops into a foreign country. But "it is error to suppose that every 
case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial
 cognizance."... This case "touches" foreign relations, but the question
 presented to us concerns only the constitutional division of power 
between Congress and the President.
[158]
 (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied) 





 Yale Law School Professor Harold Hongju Koh
[159]

 (Professor Koh) opined that a president has no general unilateral power
 to terminate treaties; instead, Senate concurrence on treaty abrogation
 is imperative.
[160]
 He posited: 



 In future cases, the constitutional requirements for 
termination should be decided based on the
 type of agreement 

in question, the 
degree of congressional 
approval
 and 
subject matter in question
, 
and Congress's effort to guide the termination and withdrawal process by
 framework legislation.
[161]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Professor Koh proposed the operation of what he dubbed as the 
"mirror principle," where "the degree of legislative approval needed to 
exit an international agreement must parallel the degree of legislative 
approval originally required to enter it."
[162]
 He further said: 



 Under the mirror principle, the Executive may terminate, 
without 
congressional participation, genuinely "sole" executive agreements that 
have lawfully been made without congressional input. But the President 
may not entirely exclude Congress from the withdrawal or termination 
process regarding congressional-executive agreements or treaties that 
were initially concluded with considerable legislative input. That 
principle would make Congress's input necessary for disengagement even 
from such international agreements as the Paris Climate Agreement, which
 broadly implicate Congress's commerce powers, and whichâwhile never 
subjected to an up-or-down voteâwere nevertheless enacted against a 
significant background of congressional awareness and support that 
implicitly authorized the presidential making, but not the unmaking, of 
climate change agreements. Congress also should participate in an 
attempt to withdraw the United States even from such political 
agreements as the Iran Nuclear Deal (also known as the JCPOA), where the
 President is exercising plenary foreign commerce powers that were 
delegated by Congress and where the U.S. termination has now triggered 
actionable claims of violation of international law.
[163]
 (Citations 
omitted)




 Professor Koh considered that, as a functional matter, 
overboard 
unilateral executive power to terminate treaties risks presidents making
 "overly hasty, partisan, or parochial withdrawals," thus weakening 
systemic stability, as well as the credibility and negotiating leverage 
of all presidents.
[164]


 The mirror principle echoes the points raised by 
Justice Robert H. Jackson's renowned concurrence
[165]
 in the separation-of-powers case, 

Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer
.
[166]
 There, he laid down
 three categories of executive action as regards the necessity of 
concomitant legislative action: 



 Category One: "when the President acts pursuant to an 
express or 
implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for 
it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that 
Congress can delegate";


 Category Two: "when the President acts in absence of either a
 
congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his 
own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and 
Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is 
uncertain"; and


 Category Three: "when the President takes measures 
incompatible 
with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at his 
lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers
 minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter."
[167]
 




 This framework has since been dubbed as the 

Youngstown
 framework,
[168]
 and was adopted in subsequent American 
cases, among them 
Medellin v. Texas
.
[169]
 


Medellin
 involved a review of the president's power 
in foreign affairs. In turn, 
Medellin

 was considered in our jurisdiction by Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno 
(Chief Justice Puno) in examining the constitutionality of the Visiting 
Forces Agreement.
[170]
 Chief Justice Puno, opined: 



 An examination of 
Bayan v. Zamora
, which 
upheld the validity of the VFA, is necessary in light of a recent change
 in U.S. policy on treaty enforcement. 
Of
 significance is the case of Medellin v. Texas, where it was held by the
 U.S. Supreme Court that while treaties entered into by the President 
with the concurrence of the Senate are binding international 
commitments, they are not domestic law unless Congress enacts 
implementing legislation or unless the treaty itself is 
"self-executing"
. 


 
An 
Examination
 of 

Medellin v. Texas


 In 
Medellin v. Texas
, Jose Ernesto 
Medellin (Medellin), a 
Mexican national, was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death
 in Texas for the gang rape and brutal murders of two Houston teenagers.
 His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. 


 Medellin then filed an application for post-conviction 
relief and 
claimed that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna 
Convention) accorded him the right to notify the Mexican consulate of 
his detention; and because the local law enforcement officers failed to 
inform him of this right, he prayed for the grant of a new trial. 



 The trial court, as affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals, rejected the Vienna Convention claim. It was ruled that 
Medellin failed to show that any non-notification of the Mexican 
authorities impacted on the validity of his conviction or punishment. 
Medellin then filed his first 
habeas corpus
 petition 
in the 
Federal District Court, which also rejected his petition. It held that 
Medellin failed to show prejudice arising from the Vienna Convention. 



 While Medellin's petition was pending, the International 
Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its decision in the 
Case 
Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Avena)
.
 The ICJ held that the U.S. violated Article 36 (1) (b) of the Vienna 
Convention by failing to inform 51 named Mexican nationals, including 
Medellin, of their Vienna Convention rights. The ICJ ruled that those 
named individuals were entitled to a review and reconsideration of their
 U.S. state court convictions and sentences regardless of their failure 
to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to 
criminal convictions. 


 In 
Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon
 â issued 
after 
Avena
 but involving individuals who were not 
named in the 
Avena

 judgment, contrary to the ICJ's determination â the U.S. Federal 
Supreme Court held that the Vienna Convention did not preclude the 
application of state default rules. The U.S. President, George W. Bush, 
then issued a Memorandum (President's Memorandum) stating that the 
United States would discharge its international obligations under 

Avena
 by having State courts give effect to the 
decision. 


 Relying on 
Avena
 and the President's 
Memorandum, Medellin filed a second Texas state-court 
habeas 
corpus

 application, challenging his state capital murder conviction and death 
sentence on the ground that he had not been informed of his Vienna 
Convention rights. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed 
Medellin's application as an abuse of the writ, since under Texas law, a
 petition for 
habeas corpus
 may not be filed 
successively, and neither 
Avena
 nor the President's 
Memorandum was binding federal law that could displace the State's 
limitations on filing successive 
habeas
 applications.
 


 Medellin repaired to the U.S. Supreme Court. In his 
petition, 
Medellin contends that the Optional Protocol, the United Nations 
Charter, and the ICJ Statute supplied the "relevant obligation" to give 
the 
Avena
 judgment binding effect in the domestic 
courts of the United States. 


 The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that neither 

Avena

 nor the President's Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal
 law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive 

habeas corpus
 petitions.

 It held that while an international treaty may constitute an 
international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress
 has enacted statutes implementing it or unless the treaty itself is 
"self-executing". It further held that decisions of the ICJ are not 
binding domestic law; and that absent an act of Congress or 
Constitutional authority, the US. President lacks the power to enforce 
international treaties or decisions of the ICJ
.


 
Requirements for Domestic Enforceability of 
Treaties in the U.S.
 


 The new ruling is clear-cut: "while a treaty may constitute 
an 
international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress
 has enacted statutes implementing it or the treaty itself conveys an 
intention that it be "self-executing" and is ratified on that basis." 



 The 
Avena
 judgment creates an 
international law obligation on the part of the United States, 

but it is not automatically binding

 domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sources â the Optional
 Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute â creates binding 
federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such 
legislation has been enacted. 


 The Court adopted a 
textual approach
 in 
determining whether the relevant treaty sources are 
self-executory[.]
[171]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 





 Later, 
Saguisag v. Ochoa
[172]

 reviewed the constitutionality of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation 
Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States 
of America. In 
Saguisag
, Justice Brion found the 

Youngstown

 framework to be a better approach than simply anchoring this Court's 
position in one constitutional provision. He proposed the examination of
 the president's act in the context of how our system of government 
works: 



 [E]ntry into international agreements is a 
shared 
function
 
among the three branches of government. In this light and in the context
 that the President's actions should be viewed under our tripartite 
system of government,
 I cannot agree with the ponencia's 
assertion 
that the case should he examined solely and strictly through the 
constitutional limitation found in Article XVIII, Section 25 of the 
Constitution.


 
IV.B (2) 
Standards in Examining 
the President's Treaty-Making 
Powers


 Because the Executive's foreign relations power operates 
within 
the larger constitutional framework of separation of powers, I find the 
examination of the President's actions through this larger framework to 
be the better approach m the present cases. This analytical framework, 
incidentally, is not the result of my original and independent thought; 
it was devised by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Robert Jackson in
 his Concurring Opinion in 
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. 
v. Sawyer
.


 Justice Jackson's framework for evaluating executive action 
categorizes the President's actions into three: 

first
, when the President acts 

with authority from the Congress
,
 his authority is at its maximum, as it includes all the powers he 
possesses in his own right and everything that Congress can 
delegate.


 
Second
, "when the 
President acts 
in the absence of either a congressional grant 
or denial of authority
,
 he can only rely on his own independent powers, but there is a 
[twilight zone where] he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or 
where its distribution is uncertain." In this situation, presidential 
authority can derive support from "congressional inertia, indifference 
or quiescence." 


 
Third
, "when the 
President takes 
measures 
incompatible with the 
expressed or implied will of Congress
,
 his power is at its lowest ebb," and the Court can sustain his actions 
"only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject." 



 This framework has been recently adopted by the U.S. Supreme
 Court in 
Medellin v. Texas
,
 a case involving the President's foreign affairs powers and one that 
can be directly instructive in deciding the present case. 


 In examining the validity of an executive act, the Court 
takes 
into consideration the varying degrees of authority that the President 
possesses. Acts of the President with the authorization of Congress 
should have the "widest latitude of judicial interpretation" and should 
be "supported by the strongest of presumptions." For the judiciary to 
overrule the executive action, it must decide that the government itself
 lacks the power. In contrast, 
executive acts that are without 
congressional imprimatur would have to be very carefully 
examined
.
[173]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) 





 The 
Youngstown
 framework was favorably 
considered and employed by this Court in its discussions in
 
Gonzales v. Marcos
[174]
 penned by Chief Justice Enrique M. 
Fernando.
 In 
Gonzales
,
 Ramon A. Gonzales alleged that in issuing Executive Order No. 30, the 
President encroached on the legislative prerogative when it created:



 [A] trust for the benefit of the Filipino people under the 
name 
and style of the Cultural Center of the Philippines entrusted with the 
task to construct national theatre, a national music hall, an arts 
building and facilities, to awaken our people's consciousness in the 
nation's cultural heritage and to encourage its assistance in the 
preservation, promotion, enhancement and development thereof, with the 
Board of Trustees to be appointed by the President, the Center having as
 its estate the real and personal property vested in it as well as 
donations received, financial commitments that could thereafter be 
collected, and gifts that may be forthcoming in the future[.]
[175]
 (Citation 
omitted)




 However, during the pendency of the case, Presidential Decree 
No. 15
 was promulgated, creating the Cultural Center of the Philippines. This 
development prompted this Court to dismiss the appeal. 	In so doing, 
this Court proceeded to explain:



 It would be an unduly narrow or restrictive view of such a 
principle if the public funds that accrued by way of donation from the 
United States and financial contributions for the Cultural Center 
project could not be legally considered as "governmental property." They
 may be acquired under the concept of 
dominium
, the 
state as a 
persona
 in law not being deprived of such 
an attribute, thereafter to be administered by virtue of its prerogative
 of 
imperium
.
 What is a more appropriate agency for assuring that they be not wasted 
or frittered away than the Executive, the department precisely entrusted
 with management functions? It would thus appear that for the President 
to refrain from taking positive steps and await the action of the then 
Congress could be tantamount to dereliction of duty. He had to act; time
 was of the essence. Delay was far from conducive to public interest. It
 was as simple as that. Certainly then, it could be only under the most 
strained construction of executive power to conclude that in taking the 
step he took, he transgressed on terrain constitutionally reserved for 
Congress. 


This is not to preclude legislative action in the 
premises
. 
While to the 	Presidency 	under the 	1935 	 Constitution 	was 	entrusted
 	 the responsibility for administering public property, the then 
Congress could provide guidelines for such a task. 
Relevant in 
this 
connection is the excerpt from an opinion of Justice Jackson in 
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer "When the President acts 
in 
absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can 
only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of 
twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in 
which its distribution is uncertain.
 Therefore, congressional 
inertia, indifference or quiescence may sometimes, at least as a 
practical matter, enable, if not invite, measures on independent 
presidential responsibility. 	In this area, any actual test of power is 
likely to depend on the imperative of events and contemporary 
imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law." To vary the 
phraseology, to recall Thomas Reed Powell, if Congress would continue to
 keep its peace notwithstanding the action taken by the executive 
department, it may be considered as silently 
vocal
. 
In plainer 
language, it could be an instance of silence meaning consent. 	The 
Executive Order assailed was issued on June 25, 1966. Congress until the
 time of the filing of the petition on August 26, 1969 remained 
quiescent. Parenthetically, it may be observed that petitioner waited 
until almost the day of inaugurating the Cultural Center on September 
11, 1969 before filing his petition in the lower court. However worthy 
of commendation was his resolute determination to keep the Presidency 
within the bounds of its competence, it cannot be denied that the 
remedy, if any, could be supplied by Congress asserting itself in the 
premises. Instead, there was apparent conformity on its part to the way 
the President saw fit to administer such governmental property.
[176]
 (Emphasis supplied, 
citations omitted)




 The 
Youngstown
 framework was also employed 
by Chief Justice Puno in evaluating the situations subject of 

Bayan v. Zamora
[177]
 and 
Akbayan v. 
Aquino
.
[178]


 In 
Bayan
, Chief Justice Puno, 
citing the 
Youngstown 
framework,
 stated: "The U.S. Supreme Court itself has 'intimated that the 
President might act in external affairs without congressional authority,
 but not that he might act contrary to an Act of Congress."'
[179]
 He reiterated this 
in 
Akbayan
.

 Thus, in appropriate cases, the validity of the president's 
actionsâwhen there are countervailing legislative prerogativesâmay be 
appraised in light of the 
Youngstown
 framework. 

 All told, the president, as primary architect of 
foreign policy,
 negotiates and enters into international agreements. However, the 
president's power is not absolute, but is checked by the Constitution, 
which requires Senate concurrence. Treaty-making is a power lodged in 
the executive, and is balanced by the legislative branch. The textual 
configuration of the Constitution hearkens both to the basic separation 
of powers and to a system of checks and balances. Presidential 
discretion is recognized, but it is not absolute. While no 
constitutional mechanism exists on how the Philippines withdraws from an
 international agreement, the president's unbridled discretion vis-Ã -vis
 treaty abrogation may run counter to the basic prudence underlying the 
entire system of entry into and domestic operation of treaties. 

 
VIII


 The mirror principle and the 

Youngstown
 framework are 
suitable starting points in reviewing the president's acts in the 
exercise of a power shared with the legislature. However, their concepts
 and methods cannot be adopted mechanically and indiscriminately. A 
compelling wisdom underlies them, but operationalizing them domestically
 requires careful consideration and adjustment in view of circumstances 
unique to the Philippine context.
 The mirror 
principle is 
anchored on balancing executive action with the extent of legislative 
participation in entering into treaties. It is sound logic to maintain 
that the same constitutional requirements of congressional 
approvalâwhich attended the effecting of treaties following original 
entry into themâmust also be followed in their 
termination.
 As proposed by Chief Justices Fernando 
and Puno, along with Justice Brion, the 
Youngstown

 framework may also guide us in reviewing executive action vis-Ã -vis the
 necessity of concomitant legislative action in withdrawing from 
treaties. When the president clearly shares power with the legislature, 
and yet disavows treaties despite no accompanying action by Congress, 
the 
Youngstown
 framework considers this an instance 
when the 
president relies exclusively on their limited independent powers. Thus, 
the validity of the withdrawal, the exercise of which should have been 
concurrent with Congress, must be critically examined. The basic, 
underlying fact of powers being shared makes it difficult to sustain the
 president's unilateral action. 
 Having laid out the 
parameters 
and underlying principles of relevant foreign concepts, and considering 
our own historical experience and prevailing legal system, this Court 
adopts the following guidelines as the modality for evaluating cases 
concerning the president's withdrawal from international agreements. 

 
First,
 the president enjoys some leeway in withdrawing from agreements which 
he or she determines to be contrary to the Constitution or 
statutes.
 

 The Constitution is the fundamental law of the land. It mandates the 
president to "ensure that the laws be faithfully executed."
[180]

 	 Both in negotiating and enforcing treaties, the president must ensure
 that all actions are in keeping with the Constitution and statutes. 
Accordingly, during negotiations, the president can insist on terms that
 are consistent with the Constitution	and 	statutes, 	or 	refuse 	to 	
pursue 	negotiations	if 	those negotiations' direction is such that the 
treaty will turn out to be repugnant to the Constitution and our 
statutes. 	Moreover, the president should not be bound to abide by a 
treaty previously entered into should it be established that such treaty
 runs afoul of the Constitution and our statutes. 
 
There are 
treaties that implement mandates provided in the Constitution, such as 
human rights. Considering the circumstances of each historical period 
our nation encounters, there will be many means to acknowledge and 
strengthen existing constitutional mandates. Participating in and 
adhering to the creation of a body such as the International Criminal 
Court by becoming a party to the Rome Statute is one such means, but so 
is passing a law that, regardless of international relations, replicates
 many of the Rome Statute's provisions and even expands its protections.
 In such instances, it is not for this Courtâabsent concrete facts 
creating an actual controversyâto make policy judgments as to which 
between a treaty and a statute is more effective, and thus, 
preferable.

 Within the hierarchy of the Philippine legal   systemâthat is, as 
instruments akin to statutesâtreaties cannot contravene the 
Constitution. Moreover, when repugnant to statues enacted by Congress, 
treaties and international agreements must give way. 

 Article 
VII, Section 21 provides for legislative involvement in making treaties 
and international agreements valid and effective, that is, by making 
Senate concurrence a necessary condition. From this, two points are 
discernible: (1) that there is a difference in the extent of legislative
 participation in enacting laws as against rendering a treaty or 
international agreement valid and effective; and (2) that Senate 
concurrence, while a necessary condition, is not in itself a sufficient 
condition for the validity and effectivity of treaties. 

 In 
enacting laws, both houses of Congress participate.	A bill undergoes 
three readings in each chamber. A bill passed by either chamber is 
scrutinized by the other, and both chambers consolidate their respective
 versions through a bicameral conference. Only after extensive 
participation by the people's elected representativesâmembers of the 
Senate who are elected at large, and, those in the House of 
Representatives who represent districts or national, regional, or 
sectoral party-list organizationsâis a bill presented to the president 
for signature. 
 In contrast, in the case of a treaty 
or 
international agreement, the president, or those acting under their 
authority, negotiates its terms. It is merely the finalized instrument 
that is presented to the Senate alone, and only for its concurrence. 
Following the president's signature, the Senate may either agree or 
disagree to the entirety of the treaty or international agreement. It 
cannot refine or modify the terms. It cannot improve what it deems 
deficient, or tame apparently excessive stipulations. 

 The 
legislature's highly limited participation means that a treaty or 
international agreement did not weather the rigors that attend regular 
lawmaking. It is true that an effective treaty underwent a special 
process involving one of our two legislative chambers, but this also 
means that it bypassed the conventional republican 
mill.
 Having 
passed scrutiny by hundreds of the people's elected representatives in 
two separate chambers which are committedâby constitutional dictumâto 
adopting legislation, statutes enacted by Congress necessarily carry 
greater democratic weight than an agreement  negotiated by a single 
person. This is true, even if that person is the chief executive who 
acts with the aid of unelected subalterns. This nuancing between 
treaties and international agreements, on one hand, and statutes on the 
other, is an imperative borne by the Philippines basic democratic and 
republican nature: that the sovereignty that resides in the people is 
exercised through elected representatives.
[181]

 Thus, a valid treaty or international agreement may be effective just 
as a statute is effective. It has the force and effect of law. Still, 
statutes enjoy preeminence over international agreements. In case of 
conflict between a law and a treaty, it is the statute that must 
prevail. 
 The second point proceeds from the first. 
The validity 
and effectivity of a treaty rests on its being in harmony with the 
Constitution and statutes. The Constitution was ratified through a 
direct act of the sovereign Filipino people voting in a plebiscite; 
statutes are adopted through concerted action by their elected 
representatives. Senate concurrence is the formal act that renders a 
treaty or international agreement effective, but it is not, in 
substance, the sole criterion for validity and effectivity. Ultimately, a
 treaty must conform to the Constitution and statutes. 

 These 
premises give the president leeway in withdrawing from treaties that he 
or she determines to be contrary to the Constitution or statutes. 

 In the event that courts determine the 
unconstitutionality of a treaty, the president may unilaterally withdraw
 from it. 

 Owing to the preeminence of statutes enacted by elected representatives
 and hurdling the rigorous legislative process, the subsequent enactment
 of a law that is inconsistent with a treaty likewise allows the 
president to withdraw from that treaty. 
 As the chief
 executive, 
the president swore to preserve and defend the Constitution, and 
faithfully execute laws. This includes the duty of appraising executive 
action, and ensuring that treaties and international agreements are not 
inimical to public interest. The abrogation of treaties that are 
inconsistent with the Constitution and statutes is in keeping with the 
president's duty to uphold the Constitution and our laws. 

 Thus, even sans a judicial determination that a 
treaty is 
unconstitutional, the president also enjoy much leeway in withdrawing 
from an agreement which, in his or her judgment, runs afoul of prior 
existing law or the Constitution. In ensuring compliance with the 
Constitution and laws, the president performs his or her sworn duty in 
abrogating a treaty that, per his or her bona fide judgment, is not in 
accord with the Constitution or a law. Between this and withdrawal owing
 to a prior judicial determination of unconstitutionality or repugnance 
to statute however, withdrawal under this basis may be relatively more 
susceptible of judicial challenge. This may be the subject of judicial 
review, on whether there was grave abuse of discretion concerning the 
president's arbitrary, baseless, or whimsical determination of 
unconstitutionality or repugnance to statute.

 
Second, the president cannot unilaterally 
withdraw from agreements which were entered into pursuant to 
congressional imprimatur.
 

 The Constitution devised a system of checks and balances in the 
exercise of powers among the branches of government. For instance, as a 
legislative check on executive power, Congress may authorize the 
president to fix tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and 
wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts subject to limitations and 
restrictions it may impose.
[182]
 The president can likewise grant amnesty, but 
with the concurrence of a majority of all members of Congress.
[183]
 
Considering that effecting treaties is a shared function between the 
executive and the legislative branches,
[184]

 Congress may expressly authorize the president to enter into a treaty 
with conditions or limitations as to negotiating 
prerogatives.
 
Similarly, a statute subsequently passed to implement a prior treaty 
signifies legislative approbation of prior executive action. This lends 
greater weight to what would otherwise have been a course of action 
pursued through executive discretion. When such a statute is adopted, 
the president cannot withdraw from the treaty being implemented unless 
the statute itself is repealed. 
 When a treaty was 
entered into 
upon Congress's express will, the president may not unilaterally 
abrogate that treaty. In such an instance, the president who signed the 
treaty simply implemented the law enacted by Congress. While the 
president performed his or her function as primary architect of 
international policy, it was in keeping with a statute. The president 
had no sole authority, and the treaty negotiations were premised nor 
only upon his or her own diplomatic powers, but on the specific 
investiture made by Congress. This means that the president negotiated 
not entirely out of his or her own volition, but with the express 
mandate of Congress, and more important, within the parameters that 
Congress has set.

 While this distinction is immaterial in 
international law, 
jurisprudence	 has treated this as a class of executive agreements. To 
recall an executive agreement implements an existing policy, and is 
entered "to adjust the details of a treaty . . . pursuant to or upon 
confirmation by an act of the Legislature; executive agreements [hinge] 
on prior constitutional or legislative authorizations."
[185]
 Executive agreements
 "inconsistent with either a law or a treaty are considered 
ineffective."
[186]


 Consistent with the mirror principle, any  
withdrawal from an 
international agreement must reflect how it was entered into. As the 
agreement was entered pursuant to congressional imprimatur, withdrawal 
from it must likewise be authorized by a law. 
 Here, 
Congress 
passed Republic Act No. 9851 well ahead of the Senate's concurrence to 
the Rome Statute. Republic Act No. 9851 is broader than the Rome Statute
 itself. This reveals not only an independent, but even a more 
encompassing legislative willâeven overtaking the courseâof 
international relations. Our elected representatives have seen it fit to
 enact a municipal law that safeguards a broader scope of rights, 
regardless of whether the Philippines formally joins the International 
Criminal Court through accession to the Rome Statute. 

 
Third, the President cannot unilaterally 
withdraw from international agreements where the Senate concurred 

and
 expressly declared that any withdrawal must also 
be made with its concurrence
. 

 The Senate may concur with a treaty or international agreement 
expressly indicating a condition that withdrawal from it must likewise 
be with its concurrence. It may be embodied in the same resolution in 
which it expressed its concurrence. It may also be that the Senate 

eventually

 indicated such a condition in a subsequent resolution. Encompassing 
legislative action may also make it a general requirement for Senate 
concurrence to be obtained in any treaty abrogation. This may mean the 
Senate invoking its prerogative through legislative action taken in 
tandem with the House of Representativesâthrough a statute or joint 
resolutionâor by adopting, on its own, a comprehensive resolution. 
Regardless of the manner by which it is invoked, what controls is the 
Senate's exercise of its prerogative to impose concurrence as a 
condition. 
 As effecting treaties is a shared 
function between 
the executive and the legislative branches, the Senate's power to concur
 with treaties necessarily includes the power to impose conditions for 
its concurrence. The requirement of Senate concurrence may then be 
rendered meaningless if it is curtailed.

 Petitioner Senator Pangilinan manifested that the 
Senate has 
adopted this condition in other resolutions through which the Senate 
concurred with treaties. However, the Senate imposed no such condition 
when it concurred in the Philippines' accession to the Rome Statute. 
Likewise, the Senate has yet to pass a resolution indicating that its 
assent should have been obtained in withdrawing from the Rome Statute. 
While there was an attempt to pass such a resolution, it has yet to be 
calendared, and thus, has no binding effect on the Senate as a collegial
 body.

 In sum, at no point and under no circumstances does 
the 
president enjoy unbridled authority to withdraw from treaties or 
international agreements. Any such withdrawal must be anchored on a 
determination that they run afoul of the Constitution or a statute. Any 
such determination must have clear and definite basis; any wanton, 
arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious withdrawal is correctible by 
judicial review. Moreover, specific circumstances attending Congress's 
injunction on the executive to proceed in treaty negotiation, or the 
Senate's specification of the need for its concurrence to be obtained in
 a withdrawal, binds the president and may prevent him or her from 
proceeding with withdrawal. 
 
IX


 It is wrong to state that matters of foreign 
relations are political questions, and thus, beyond the judiciary's 
reach. 

 The Constitution expressly states that this Court, through its power of
 judicial review, may declare any treaty or international agreement 
unconstitutional: 



 SECTION 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following 
powers: 


 . . . .


 (2) Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal or 
certiorari, as the law or the Rules of Court may provide, final 
judgments and orders of lower courts in:




 (a) All cases in which the 

constitutionality or validity of any treaty, 
international or executive agreement
, law, 
presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or 
regulation is in question.
[187]
 (Emphasis supplied)






 We take this opportunity to clarify the pronouncements made in
	 
Secretary of Justice v. Lantion
,
[188]

 where this Court summarized the rules when courts are confronted with a
 conflict between a rule of international law and municipal law. It 
stated:



 The doctrine of incorporation is applied whenever municipal 
tribunals (or local courts) are confronted with situations in which  
there appears to be a conflict between a rule of international law and 
the provisions of the constitution or statute of the local state. 
Efforts should first be exerted to harmonize them, so as to give effect 
to both since it is to be presumed that municipal law was enacted with 
proper regard for the generally accepted principles of international law
 in observance of the observance of the Incorporation Clause in the 
above-cited constitutional provision[.] In a situation, however, where 
the conflict is irreconcilable and a choice has to be made between a 
rule of international law and municipal law, jurisprudence dictates that
 municipal law should be upheld by the municipal courts. . . for the 
reason that such courts are organs of municipal law and are accordingly 
bound by it in all circumstances[.] The fact that international law has 
been made part of the law of the land does not pertain to or imply the 
primacy of international law over national or municipal law in the 
municipal sphere. The doctrine of incorporation, as applied in most 
countries, decrees that rules of international law are given equal 
standing with, but 	are not superior to, national 	legislative 
enactments. Accordingly, the principle 
lex posterior derogat 
priori

 takes effect â a treaty may repeal a statute and a statute may repeal a
 treaty. In states where the constitution is the highest law of the 
land, such as the Republic of the Philippines, both statutes and 
treaties may be invalidated if they are in conflict with the 
constitution[.]
[189]
 (Citations 
omitted)




 
Lantion
 discussed the 
incorporation doctrine embodied in 
Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Through incorporation, the 
Philippines adopts international custom and general principle of law as 
part of the law of the land. 
Lantion 
clarified that 
despite being
 part of the legal system, this "does not pertain to or imply the 
primacy of international law over national or municipal law in the 
municipal sphere."
[190]
 However, it goes on to state that 
"
lex posterior derogat priori
 takes effectâa treaty 
may repeal a statute and a statute may repeal a treaty."
[191]


 Previously, we have extensively discussed how, 
despite being 
both sources of international law, treaties must be distinguished from 
generally accepted principles of international law. Article II, Section 2
 automatically 
incorporates 
generally accepted 
principles of 
international law into the domestic sphere. On the other hand, Article 
VII, Section 21 operates differently and concerns an entirely distinct 
source of international law. It signifies that treaties and 
international agreements are not automatically incorporated to the 
Philippine legal system, but are 
transformed
 into 
domestic law by Senate concurrence.

 Thus, 
Lantionâs
 pronouncement 
thatâ"
lex posterior derogat priori
 takes effectâa 
treaty may repeal a statute and a statute may repeal a treaty"
[192]
âis misplaced and 
unsupported by its internal logic. Its fallacy frustrates its viability 
as precedent. Besides, it was mere 
obiter dictum

 as this Court did not even rule on the constitutionality of the 
assailed Republic of the Philippines-United States Extradition Treaty. 

 Courts, in which judicial power is vested, may void 
executive and legislative acts when they violate the 
Constitution.
[193]


 The president is the head of state and chief 
executive. The 
Constitution mandates that in performing his or her functions, the 
president must "ensure that the laws be faithfully executed."
[194]

 Thus, upon assuming office, a president swears to "faithfully and 
conscientiously fulfill my duties. . . preserve and defend [the] 
Constitution, execute. . . laws, do justice to every man, and consecrate
 myself to the service of the Nation."
[195]


 Accordingly, in fulfilling his or her functions as 
primary 
architect of foreign policy, and in negotiating and enforcing treaties, 
all of the president's actions must always be within the bounds of the 
Constitution and our laws. This mandate is exceeded when acting outside 
what the Constitution or our laws allow. When any such excess is so 
grave, whimsical, arbitrary, or attended by bad faith, it can be 
invalidated through judicial review.

 
X


 The Petitions here raise interesting legal 
questions. However, 
the factual backdrop of these consolidated cases renders inopportune a 
ruling on the issues presented to this Court. 

 Separation of powers is fundamental in our legal 
system. The 
Constitution delineated the powers among the legislative, executive, and
 judicial branches of the government, with each having autonomy and 
supremacy within its own sphere.
[196]

 This is moderated by a system of checks and balances "carefully 
calibrated by the Constitution to temper the official acts" of each 
branch.
[197]


 Among the three branches, the judiciary was 
designated as the arbiter in allocating constitutional 
boundaries.
[198]
 
Judicial power is defined in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution
 as:



 SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme
 Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.
  


 Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to
 
settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally 
demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has 
been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of 
jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the 
government.
  




 A plain reading of the Constitution identifies two instances 
when judicial power is exercised: (1) in 
settling actual 
controversies 
involving rights which are legally demandable 
and enforceable; and (2) in determining 
whether or not there 
has been a grave abuse of discretion
 amounting to a lack or 
excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of 
the government. 

 In justifying judicial review in its traditional 
sense, Justice Jose P. Laurel in 
Angara v. Electoral 
Commission
[199]

 underscored that when this Court allocates constitutional boundaries, 
it neither asserts supremacy nor annuls the legislature's acts. It 
simply carries out the obligations that the Constitution imposed upon it
 to determine conflicting claims and to establish the parties' rights in
 an actual controversy: 



 The Constitution is a definition of the powers of 
government. Who 
is to determine the nature, scope and extent of such powers? The 
Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the 
judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to 
allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority 
over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate
 an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred 
obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting 
claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the 
parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument 
secures and guarantees to them. This is in truth all that is involved in
 what is termed "judicial supremacy" which properly is the power of 
judicial review under the Constitution.
[200]






 The latter conception of judicial power that jurisprudence 
refers to as the "expanded certiorari jurisdiction"
[201]
 was an innovation of the 1987 
Constitution:
[202]




 This situation changed after 1987 when the new Constitution 
"expanded" the scope of judicial power[.]
  


 . . . .
  


 In 
Francisco v. The House of 
Representatives
, we recognized
 that this expanded jurisdiction was meant "to ensure the potency of the
 power of judicial review to curb grave abuse of discretion by 'any 
branch or instrumentalities of government."' Thus, the second paragraph 
of Article VIII, Section 1 engraves, for the first time in its history, 
into black letter law the "expanded certiorari jurisdiction" of this 
Court, whose nature and purpose had been provided in the sponsorship 
speech of its proponent, former Chief Justice Constitutional 
Commissioner Roberto Concepcion. 
  


 . . . .
  


 Meanwhile that no specific procedural rule has been 
promulgated to
 enforce this "expanded" constitutional definition of judicial power and
 because of the commonality of "grave abuse of discretion" as a ground 
for review under Rule 65 and the courts' expanded jurisdiction, the 
Supreme Court based on its power to relax its rules allowed Rule 65 to 
be used as the medium for petitions invoking the courts' expanded 
jurisdiction based on its power to relax its Rules. This is however an 
ad hoc approach that does not fully consider the accompanying 
implications, among them, that Rule 65 is an essentially distinct remedy
 that cannot simply be bodily lifted for application under the judicial 
power's expanded mode. The terms of Rule 65, too, are not fully aligned 
with what the Court's expanded jurisdiction signifies and requires. 
  


 On the basis of almost thirty years' experience with the 
courts' 
expanded jurisdiction, the Court should now fully recognize the 
attendant distinctions and should be aware that the continued use of 
Rule 65 on an ad hoc basis as the operational remedy in implementing its
 expanded jurisdiction may, in the longer term, result in problems of 
uneven, misguided, or even incorrect application of the courts' expanded
 mandate.
[203]






 
TaÃ±ada v. Angara
[204]
 characterized this not only as a 
power, but as a duty ordained by the Constitution: 



 It is an innovation in our political law. As explained by 
former 
Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, "the judiciary is the final arbiter on
 the question of whether or not a branch of government or any of its 
officials has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or
 so capriciously as to constitute an abuse of discretion amounting to 
excess of jurisdiction. 
This is not only a judicial power but a
 duty to pass judgment on matters of this nature
 "
  


 As this Court has repeatedly and firmly emphasized in many 
cases, 
it will not shirk, digress from or abandon its sacred duty and authority
 to uphold the Constitution in matters that involve grave abuse of 
discretion brought before it in appropriate cases, committed by any 
officer, agency, instrumentality or department of the government.
[205]
 (Emphasis supplied,
 citations omitted)
  




 Despite its expansion, judicial review has its limits. In 
deciding 
matters involving grave abuse of discretion, courts cannot brush aside 
the requisite of an actual case or controversy. The clause articulating 
expanded certiorari jurisdiction requires a 
prima 
facie
 showing 
of grave abuse of discretion in the assailed governmental act which, in 
essence, is the actual case or controversy. Thus, "even now, under the 
regime of the textually broadened power of judicial review articulated 
in Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution, the requirement of 
an actual case or controversy is not dispensed with."
[206]


 In 
Provincial Bus Operators Association of 
the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment
:
[207]




 An actual case or controversy is "one which involves a 
conflict of
 legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of 
judicial resolution." A case is justiciable if the issues presented are 
"definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of parties 
having adverse legal interests." The conflict must be ripe for judicial 
determination, not conjectural or anticipatory; otherwise, this Court's 
decision will amount to an advisory opinion concerning legislative or 
executive action.
  


 . . . .
  


 Even the expanded jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
VIII, 
Section 1 does not provide license to provide advisory opinions. An 
advisory opinion is one where the factual setting is conjectural or 
hypothetical. In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient 
concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this 
Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen
 narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no
 such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity. They will 
bind the future parties who may have more motives to choose specific 
legal arguments. In other words, for there to be a real conflict between
 the parties, there must exist actual facts from which courts can 
properly determine whether there has been a breach of constitutional 
text.
[208]






 Thus, whether in its traditional or expanded scope, the 
exercise of 
judicial review requires the concurrence of these requisites for 
justiciability:



 (a) there must be an actual case or controversy calling for 
the 
exercise of judicial power; (b) the person challenging the act must have
 the standing to question the validity of the subject act or issuance . .
 . ; (c) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the 
earliest opportunity; and (d) the issue of constitutionality must be the
 very 
lis mota
 of the case.
[209]
 (Citations omitted)
  




 
XI


 The Petitions are moot. They fail to present a 
persisting case or controversy that impels this Court's review.

 In resolving constitutional issues, there must be an
 "existing 
case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not 
conjectural or anticipatory."
[210]


 An actual case deals with conflicting rights that 
are legally 
demandable and enforceable. It involves definite facts and incidents to 
be appreciated, and laws to be applied, interpreted and enforced 
vis-Ã -vis ascertained facts. It must be "definite and concrete, touching
 the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interest; a real 
and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief."
[211]


 A constitutional question may not be presented to 
this Court at 
an inopportune time. When it is premature, this Court's ruling shall be 
relegated as an advisory opinion for a potential, future occurrence. 
When belated, concerning matters that are moot, the decision will no 
longer affect the parties.

 Either way, courts must avoid resolving hypothetical
 problems or
 academic questions. This exercise of judicial restraint ensures that 
the judiciary will not encroach on the powers of other branches of 
government. As 
Angara v. Electoral Commission
[212]
 explained:



 [T]his power of judicial review is limited to actual cases 
and 
controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the 
parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or 
the very 
lis mota
 presented. Any attempt at 
abstraction could 
only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile 
conclusions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than 
that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative 
enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the
 Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of 
actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of 
the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive 
and legislative departments of the government.
[213]






 The requirement of a bona fide controversy precludes advisory 
opinions and judicial legislation. For this Court, "only constitutional 
issues that are narrowly framed, sufficient to resolve an actual case, 
may be entertained,"
[214]
 and only when they are raised at the opportune
 time.

 A case is moot when it "ceases to present a 
justiciable 
controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration 
thereon would be of no practical use or value."
[215]

 There may have been conflicting rights, disputed facts, or meritorious 
claims warranting this Court's intervention, but a supervening event 
rendered the issue stale. In 
PeÃ±afrancia Sugar Mill, Inc. v. 
Sugar Regulatory Administration
:
[216]




 A case or issue is considered moot and academic when it 
ceases to 
present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so 
that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be 
of no practical value or use. In such instance, there is no actual 
substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which 
would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. Courts generally 
decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of 
mootness. This is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose
 or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it
 cannot be enforced.

 On March 19, 2019, the International Criminal Court itself, 
through 
Mr. O-Gon Kwon, the president of the Assembly of States Parties, 
announced the Philippines' departure from the Rome Statute effective 
March 17, 2019. It made this declaration with regret and the hope that 
such departure "is only temporary and that it will re-join the Rome 
Statute family in the future."
[218]


 This declaration, coming from the International 
Court itself, 
settles any doubt on whether there are lingering factual occurrences 
that may be adjudicated. No longer is there an unsettled incident 
demanding resolution. Any discussion on the Philippines' withdrawal is, 
at this juncture, merely a matter of theory.

 However, even prior to the filing of these 
Petitions,
[219]
 
the President had already completed the irreversible act of withdrawing 
from the Rome Statute.

 To reiterate, Article 127(1) of the Rome Statute 
provides the mechanism on how its state parties may withdraw:



 A State Party may, by written notification addressed to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, withdraw from this Statute. The
 withdrawal shall take effect one year after the date of receipt of the 
notification, unless the notification specifies a later date. 
  




 
The Philippines announced its withdrawal 
from the Rome Statute
 on March 15, 2018, and formally submitted its Notice of Withdrawal 
through a Note Verbale to the United Nations Secretary-General's Chef de
 Cabinet on March 16, 2018. The Secretary-General received the 
notification on March 17, 2018. For all intents and purposes, and in 
keeping with what the Rome Statute plainly requires, the Philippines 
had, by then, completed all the requisite acts of withdrawal. The 
Philippines has done all that were needed to facilitate the withdrawal. 
Any subsequent discussion would pertain to matters that are fait 
accompli.


 On March 20, 2018, the International Criminal Court 
issued a 
statement on the Philippines' Notice of Withdrawal. The United Nations 
certified that the Philippines deposited the written notification on 
March 17, 2018. It stressed that while withdrawal from the Rome Statute 
is a sovereign decision, it has no impact on any pending 
proceedings.
[220]
 
In any case, the International Criminal Court expressed no reservation 
on the efficacy of the withdrawal.

 At that point, this Court's interference and ruling 
on what 
course of action to take would mean an imposition of its will not only 
on the executive, but also on the International Criminal Court itself. 
That is not the function of this Court, which takes on a passive role in
 resolving actual controversies when proper parties raise them at an 
opportune time. In the international arena, it is the president that has
 the authority to conduct foreign relations and represent the country. 
This Court cannot encroach on matters beyond its jurisdiction.

 Moreover, while its text provides a mechanism on how
 to withdraw
 from it, the Rome Statute does not have any proviso on the reversal of a
 state party's withdrawal. We fail to see how this Court can revokeâas 
what petitioners are in effect asking us to doâthe country's withdrawal 
from the Rome Statute, without writing new terms into the Rome Statute.

 Petitioners harp on the withdrawal's effectivity, 
which was one 
year from the United Nations Secretary-General's receipt of the 
notification. However, this one-year period only pertains to the 

effectivity
,
 or when exactly the legal consequences of the withdrawal takes effect. 
It neither concerns approval nor finality of the withdrawal. 
Parenthetically, this one-year period does not undermine or diminish the
 International Criminal Court's jurisdiction and power to continue a 
probe that it has commenced while a state was a party to the Rome 
Statute. 

 Here, the withdrawal has been communicated and 
accepted, and 
there are no means to retract it. This Court cannot extend the reliefs 
that petitioners seek. The Philippines's withdrawal from the Rome 
Statute has been properly received and acknowledged by the United 
Nations Secretary-General, and has taken effect. These are all that the 
Rome Statute entails, and these are all that the international community
 would require for a valid withdrawal. Having been consummated, these 
actions bind the Philippines. 

 In G.R. No. 238875, petitioners posit: 



 If the Executive can unilaterally withdraw from any treaty 
or 
international agreement, he is in a position to abrogate some of the 
basic norms in our legal system. Thus, the Executive can unilaterally 
withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the Geneva Conventions[,] and the United Nations Convention on the Law 
of the Sea, without any checking mechanism from Congress. This would be 
an undemocratic concentration of power in the Executive that could not 
have been contemplated by the Constitution.
[221]






 We reiterate that courts may only rule on an actual case. This
 Court
 has no jurisdiction to rule on matters that are abstract, hypothetical,
 or merely potential. Petitioners' fear that the President may 
unilaterally withdraw from other treaties has not transpired and cannot 
be taken cognizance of by this Court in this case. We have the duty to 
determine when we should stay our hand, and refuse to rule on cases 
where the issues are speculative and theoretical, and consequently, not 
justiciable.
[222]


 Legislative and executive powers impel the concerned
 branches of
 government into assuming a more proactive role in our constitutional 
order. Judicial power, on the other hand, limits this Court into taking a
 passive stance. Such is the consequence of separation of powers. Until 
an actual case is brought before us by the proper parties at the 
opportune time, where the constitutional question is the very 

lis mota
, we cannot act on an issue, no matter how 
much it agonizes us.

 
XII


 Parties have
 standing
 if they 
stand to be benefited if 
the case is resolved in their favor, or if they shall suffer should the 
case be decided against them.
[223]


 In 
Falcis III v. Civil Registrar 
General
,
[224]
 this Court explained:



 Much like the requirement of an actual case or controversy, 
legal 
standing ensures that a party is seeking a concrete outcome or relief 
that may be granted by courts:
  




 Legal standing or
 locus standi
 is the 
"right of 
appearance in a court of justice on a given question." To possess legal 
standing, parties must show "a personal and substantial interest in the 
case such that [they have] sustained or will sustain direct injury as a 
result of the governmental act that is being challenged." The 
requirement of direct injury guarantees that the party who brings suit 
has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and, in 
effect, assures "that concrete adverseness which sharpens the 
presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of 
difficult constitutional questions."
    


 The requirements of legal standing and the recently 
discussed 
actual case and controversy are both "built on the principle of 
separation of powers, sparing as it does unnecessary interference or 
invalidation by the judicial branch of the actions rendered by its 
co-equal branches of government." In addition, economic reasons justify 
the rule. Thus: 


A lesser but not insignificant reason for screening the 
standing 
of persons who desire to litigate constitutional issues is economic in 
character. Given the sparseness of our resources, the capacity of courts
 to render efficient judicial service to our people is severely limited.
 For courts to indiscriminately open their doors to all types of suits 
and suitors is for them to unduly overburden their dockets, and 
ultimately render themselves ineffective dispensers of justice. To be 
sure, this is an evil that clearly confronts our judiciary today.
    


 Standing in private suits requires that actions be 
prosecuted or
 defended m the name of the real party-in-interest, interest being 
"material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree 
or judgment of the case[,] [not just] mere curiosity about the question 
involved." Whether a suit is public or private, the parties must have "a
 present substantial interest," not a "mere expectancy or a future, 
contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest." Those who bring the
 suit must possess their own right to the relief sought. . . . 
    




 Even for exceptional suits filed by taxpayers, legislators, 
or 
concerned citizens, this Court has noted that the party must claim some 
kind of injury-in-fact.
[225]
 (Citations omitted)
  




 In G.R. No. 238875, petitioners-senators were then incumbent 
minority senators who allege that the Senate's constitutional 
prerogative to concur in the government's decision to withdraw from the 
Rome Statute has been impaired. They add that they were likewise suing 
as citizens, as this case allegedly involves a "public right and its 
object . . . is to procure the enforcement of a public duty."
[226]


 Petitioners-senators also claim that the issue has 
transcendental importance, which may potentially impact constitutional 
checks and balances, our domestic legal system, and the country's 
relations with the international community.
[227]


 In G.R. No. 239483, petitioner Philippine Coalition 
for the 
International Criminal Court and its individual members assert that, as 
Philippine citizens and as human beings, they have rights to life and 
personal security. The withdrawal from the Rome Statute, they claim, 
violates their rights to ample remedies for the protection of their 
rights, "and of their other fundamental rights especially the right to 
life."
[228]


 They likewise contend that their Petition is a 
taxpayers' suit, 
since the executive department spent substantial taxpayer's money in 
attending negotiations and in participating in the drafting of what 
would be the Rome Statute.
[229]


 In G.R. No. 240954, the Integrated Bar of the 
Philippines comes 
to this Court on essentially the same ground: as a group of concerned 
citizens, it invokes its members' right to life and due process that may
 be affected by the withdrawal. Additionally, it claims that as a body 
that aims to uphold the rule of law, it has standing to the question 
whether the withdrawal was proper.
[230]


 Jurisprudence has consistently recognized each 
legislator's 
individual standing and prerogative independent of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate as a collegial body.
[231]

 A legislator's individual standing and prerogative remains and is not 
abandoned in this case. However, the precise circumstances here subvert 
the otherwise generally recognized standing which anchors the individual
 legislators' capacity to seek relief. Here, the Senate's inaction makes
 premature petitioners-senators' capacity to seek relief. The Senate's 
institutional reticence subverts the capacities otherwise properly 
accruing to petitioners-senators.

 The Senate has refrained from passing a resolution 
indicating 
that its assent should have been obtained in withdrawing from the Rome 
Statute. Senate Resolution No. 289,
[232]

 or the "Resolution Expressing the Sense of the Senate that Termination 
of, or Withdrawal from, Treaties and International Agreements Concurred 
in by the Senate shall be Valid and Effective Only Upon Concurrence by 
the Senate," has been presented to but, thus far, never adopted by the 
Senate.

 During the September 4, 2018 oral arguments, 
petitioner Senator 
Pangilinan himself manifested the resolution's pendency, which he 
claimed was "not rejected . . . but was not calendared for 
adoption."
[233]

 Thus, Senate Resolution No. 289 has absolutely no legal effect. Such 
reticence on this matter means that, as a collegial body, and in its 
wisdom, the Senate has chosen not to assert any right or prerogative 
which it may feel pertains to it, if any, to limit, balance, or 
otherwise inhibit the President's act.

 The passage of Resolution No. 289 would have been a 
definite 
basis on which petitioners-senators can claim a right. However, the 
Senate itself appears to have not seen the need for it. Thus, 
petitioners-senators cannot validly come to this Court with a case that 
is already foreclosed by their own institution's inaction.

 Moreover, as discussed, petitioner Senator 
Pangilinan mentioned 
during oral arguments that the Senate has passed 17 resolutions 
concurring on different treaties, each of which came with a clause that 
specifically required its concurrence for withdrawal.
[234]
 In contrast, no 
similar clause was contained in Senate Resolution No. 546,
[235]

 through which the Senate ratified the Rome Statute. Thus, the Senate's 
inaction itself precludes a source from which petitioners-senators could
 claim a right to require Senate concurrence to withdrawing from the 
Rome Statute.

 Incidentally, in
 Goldwater
, the 
United States Supreme 
Court also declined to rule on the substance of the case. There, then 
Senator Barry Goldwater and other Congress members assailed then 
President Carter's unilateral nullification of the Sino-American Mutual 
Defense Treaty, claiming that this should have required Senate 
concurrence. However, Congress had not formally taken a stance contrary 
to the president's action through any resolution. There was a draft 
Senate resolution, but no vote was taken on it.
[236]
 Justice Powell noted:



 This Court has recognized that an issue should not be 
decided if 
it is not ripe for judicial review Prudential considerations persuade me
 that a dispute between Congress and the President is not ready for 
judicial review unless and until each branch has taken action asserting 
its constitutional authority. Differences between the President and the 
Congress are commonplace under our system. The differences should, and 
almost invariably do, turn on political, rather than legal, 
considerations. 
The Judicial Branch should not decide issues 
affecting the allocation of power between the President and Congress 
until the political branches reach a 
constitutional 
impasse
. 
Otherwise, we would encourage small groups, or even individual Members, 
of Congress to seek judicial resolution of issues before the normal 
political process has the opportunity to resolve the conflict
.
  


 In this case, a few Members of Congress claim that the 
President's
 action in terminating the treaty with Taiwan has deprived them of their
 constitutional role with respect to a change in the supreme law of the 
land. 
Congress has taken no official action
. In the 
present 
posture of this case, we do not know whether there ever will be an 
actual confrontation between the Legislative and Executive Branches. 
Although the Senate has considered a resolution declaring that Senate 
approval is necessary for the termination of any mutual defense treaty, 
no final vote has been taken on the resolution. Moreover, it is unclear 
whether the resolution would have retroactive effect. It cannot be said 
that either the Senate or the House has rejected the President's claim. 
If the Congress chooses not to confront the President, it is not our 
task to do so.
[237]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
  




 Similarly, this Court should stay its hand when the Senate 
itself, 
as a collegial body, has not officially confronted the President's act. 
This is in keeping with the limits of judicial review.

 On the other hand, persons invoking their rights as 
citizens 
must satisfy the following requisites to file a suit: (1) they must have
 "personally suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of 
the allegedly illegal conduct of government"; (2) "the injury is fairly 
traceable to the challenged action"; and (3) "the injury is likely to be
 redressed by a favorable action."
[238]


 In G.R. Nos. 239483 and 240954, what petitioners 
assail is an 
act of the President, in the exercise of his executive power. They 
failed to show the actual or imminent injury that they sustained as a 
result of the President's withdrawal from the Rome Statute. Again, 
"whether a suit is public or private, the parties must have 'a present 
substantial interest,' not a 'mere expectancy or a future, contingent, 
subordinate, or consequential interest."'
[239]


 Similarly, petitioners have no standing as 
taxpayers. In cases 
involving expenditure of public funds, also known as a taxpayer's suit, 
"there must be a claim of illegal disbursement of public funds or that 
the tax measure is unconstitutional[.]"
[240]


 Petitioners here failed to show any illegal 
expenditure of 
public funds. To allow these petitioners who suffer no injury to invoke 
this Court's discretion would be to allow everyone to come to courts on 
the flimsiest of grounds. 

 Parties must possess their own right to the relief 
sought, and a
 general invocation of citizen's or a taxpayer's rights is insufficient.
 This Court must not indiscriminately open its doors to every person 
urging it to take cognizance of a case where they have no demonstrable 
injury. This may ultimately render this Court ineffective to dispense 
justice as cases clog its docket.
[241]


 This Court has also recognized that an association 
may file 
petitions on behalf of its members on the basis of third party standing.
 However, to do so, the association must meet the following 
requirements: (1) "the [party bringing suit] must have suffered an 
'injury-in-fact,' thus giving [it] a 'sufficiently concrete interest" in
 the outcome of the issue in dispute"; (2) "the party must have a close 
relation to the third party"; and (3) "there must exist some hindrance 
to the third party's ability to protect his or her own 
interests."
[242]


 In 
Pharmaceutical and Health Care 
Association of the Philippines v. Secretary of Health
,
[243]

 this Court found that an association "has the legal personality to 
represent its members because the results of the case will affect their 
vital interests":
[244]




 The modern view. . . . fuses the legal identity of an 
association 
with that of its members. An association has standing to file suit for 
its workers despite its lack of direct interest if its members are 
affected by the action. An organization has standing to assert the 
concerns of its constituents.
  


 . . . .
  


 We note that, under its Articles of Incorporation, the 
respondent 
was organized ... to act as the representative of any individual, 
company, entity or association on matters related to the manpower 
recruitment industry, and to perform other acts and activities necessary
 to accomplish the purposes embodied therein. The respondent is, thus, 
the appropriate party to assert the rights of its members, because it 
and its members are in every practical sense identical. . . The 
respondent [association] is but the medium through which its individual 
members seek to make more effective the expression of their voices and 
the redress of their grievances.
[245]






 In 
Provincial Bus Operators Association of the 
Philippines
,
[246]

 this Court did not allow the association of bus operators to represent 
its members. There were no board resolutions or articles of 
incorporation presented to show that it was authorized to file the 
petition on the members' behalf. Some of the associations even had their
 certificates of incorporation revoked. This Court ruled that it is 
insufficient to simply allege that the petitioners are associations that
 represent their members who will be directly injured by the 
implementation of a law:



 The associations in 
Pharmaceutical and Health Care 
Association of the Philippines, Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, 
Inc
., and 
The Executive Secretary

 were allowed to sue on behalf of their members because they 
sufficiently established who their members were, that their members 
authorized the associations to sue on their behalf, and that the members
 would be directly injured by the challenged governmental acts.
  


 The liberality of this Court to grant standing for 
associations or
 corporations whose members are those who suffer direct and substantial 
injury depends on a few factors.
  


 In all these cases, there must be 
an actual 
controversy
. Furthermore, there should also be a 

clear and convincing demonstration of special reasons why the 
truly injured parties may not be able to sue
.
  


 Alternatively, there must be a similarly clear and 
convincing 
demonstration that the representation of the association is more 
efficient for the petitioners to bring. They must further show that it 
is more efficient for this Court to hear only one voice from the 
association. In other words, the association should show special reasons
 for bringing the action themselves rather than as a class suit, allowed
 when the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general 
interest to many persons. In a class suit, a number of the members of 
the class are permitted to sue and to defend for the benefit of all the 
members so long as they are sufficiently numerous and representative of 
the class to which they belong.
  


 In some circumstances similar to those in 
White 
Light
, the 
third parties represented by the petitioner would have special and 
legitimate reasons why they may not bring the action themselves. 
Understandably, the cost to patrons in the 
White 
Light
 case to 
bring the action themselvesâi.e., the amount they would pay for the 
lease of the motelsâwill be too small compared with the cost of the 
suit. But viewed in another way, whoever among the patrons files the 
case even for its transcendental interest endows benefits on a 
substantial number of interested parties without recovering their costs.
 This is the free rider problem in economics. It is a negative 
externality which operates as a disincentive to sue and assert a 
transcendental right.
[247]
 (Citation omitted, emphasis supplied)
  




 Here, both petitioners-associations, the Integrated Bar of the
 
Philippines and the Philippine Coalition for the International Criminal 
Court, failed to convince this Court why they must be heard as 
associations. Advocating human rights as an institution is insufficient.
 No special reason was alleged, let alone proved, why its allegedly 
injured members may not file the case themselves.

 Worse, the members of the Philippine Coalition for 
the 
International Criminal Court joined the case as petitioners, albeit 
likewise failing to exhibit actual or imminent injury from which they 
stand to suffer.

 
 XIII


 Transcendental importance is often invoked in 
instances when the
 petitioners fail to establish standing in accordance with customary 
requirements. However, its general invocation cannot negate the 
requirement of 
locus standi
. Facts must be 
undisputed, only legal
 issues must be present: and proper and sufficient justifications why 
this Court should not simply stay its hand must be clear.

 
Falcis 
explained:



 
Diocese of Bacolod
 recognized 
transcendental importance as 
an exception to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. In cases of 
transcendental importance, imminent and clear threats to constitutional 
rights warrant a direct resort to this Court. This was clarified in 

Gios-Samar
.
 There, this Court emphasized that transcendental importance â 
originally cited to relax rules on legal standing and not as an 
exception to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts â applies only to cases
 with purely legal issues. We explained that the decisive factor in 
whether this Court should permit the invocation of transcendental 
importance is not merely the presence of "special and important 
reason[,]" but the nature of the question presented by the parties. This
 Court declared that there must be no disputed facts, and the issues 
raised should only be questions of law:
  




 [W]hen a question before the Court involves determination 
of a 
factual issue indispensable to the resolution of the legal issue, the 
Court will refuse to resolve the question regardless of the allegation 
or invocation of compelling reasons, such as the transcendental or 
paramount importance of the case. Such question must first be brought 
before the proper trial courts or the CA, both of which are specially 
equipped to try and resolve factual questions. 
    




 Still, it does not follow that this Court should proceed to 
exercise its power of judicial review just because a case is attended 
with purely legal issues. Jurisdiction ought to be distinguished from 
justiciability. Jurisdiction pertains to competence "to hear, try[,] and
 decide a case." On the other hand, 
  




 [d]etermining whether the case, or any of the issues 
raised, is 
justiciable is an exercise of the power granted to a court with 
jurisdiction over a case that involves constitutional adjudication. 
Thus, even if this Court has jurisdiction, the canons of constitutional 
adjudication in our jurisdiction allow us to disregard the questions 
raised at our discretion. 
    




 Appraising justiciability is typified by constitutional 
avoidance.
 This remains a matter of enabling this Court to act in keeping with its
 capabilities. Matters of policy are properly left to government organs 
that are better equipped at framing them. Justiciability demands that 
issues and judicial pronouncements be properly framed in relation to 
established facts: 
  




 Angara v. Electoral Commission imbues these rules with its
 libertarian character. Principally, 
Angara

 emphasized the liberal deference to another constitutional department 
or organ given the majoritarian and representative character of the 
political deliberations in their forums. It is not merely a judicial 
stance dictated by courtesy, but is rooted on the very nature of this 
Court. Unless congealed in constitutional or statutory text and 
imperatively called for by the actual and non-controversial facts of the
 case, this Court does not express policy. This Court should channel 
democratic deliberation where it should take place.
    


 . . . .
    


 Judicial restraint is also founded on a policy of 
conscious and 
deliberate caution. This Court should refrain from speculating on the 
facts of a case and should allow parties to shape their case instead. 
Likewise, this Court should avoid projecting hypothetica.l situations 
where none of the parties can fully argue simply because they have not 
established the facts or are not interested in the issues raised by the 
hypothetical situations. In a way, courts are mandated to adopt an 
attitude of judicial skepticism. What we think may be happening may not 
at all be the case. Therefore, this Court should always await the proper
 case to be properly pleaded and proved.
    




 Thus, concerning the extent to which transcendental 
importance 
carves exceptions to the requirements of justiciability, "[t]he elements
 supported by the facts of an actual case, and the imperatives of our 
role as the Supreme Court within a specific cultural or historic 
context, must be made clear":
  




 They should be properly pleaded by the petitioner so that 
whether there is any transcendental importance to a case is made an 
issue. That a case has transcendental importance, as applied, may have 
been too ambiguous and subjective that it undermines the structural 
relationship that this Court has with the sovereign people and other 
departments under the Constitution. Our rules on jurisdiction and our 
interpretation of what is justiciable, refined with relevant cases, may 
be enough.
    




 
Otherwise, this Court would cede 
unfettered prerogative on 
parties. It would enable the parties to impose their own determination 
of what issues are of paramount; national significance, warranting 
immediate attention by the highest court of the 
land.
[248]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
  




 
Chamber of Real Estate and Builders' Associations, 
Inc. v. Energy Regulatory Commission
[249]
 lists the following considerations
 to determine whether an issue is of transcendental importance:



 (1) the character of the funds or other assets involved in 
the 
case; (2) the presence of a clear case of disregard of a constitutional 
or statutory prohibition by the public respondent agency or 
instrumentality of the government; and (3) the lack of any other party 
with a more direct and specific interest in the questions being 
raised.
[250]
 
(Citation omitted)
  




 Here, all petitioners invoked the supposed transcendental 
importance
 of the constitutional issues. However, none of the exceptional 
conditions warranting the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction is 
present here. This case does not involve funds or assets. Neither was 
there any express disregard of a constitutional or statutory 
prohibition. Petitioners also failed to show that no other party has a 
more direct, personal, and material interest. Petitioners failed to 
invoke any source of right to bring these Petitions.

 This Court is competent to decide legal principles 
only in 
properly justiciable cases. That a party must have standing in court is 
not a mere technical rule that may easily be waived. Courts should be 
scrupulous in protecting the principles of justiciability, or else their
 legitimacy may be undermined.
[251]

 Transcendental importance of issues excusing requisite standing should 
not be so recklessly invoked, and is justified only in extraordinary 
circumstances.

 The alleged transcendental importance of the issues 
raised here 
will be better served when there are actual cases with the proper 
parties suffering an actual or imminent injury. No injury so great and 
so imminent was shown here, such that this Court cannot instead 
adjudicate on the occasion of an appropriate case.

 The writ of certiorari which may be issued under 
Rule 65 of the 
Rules of Court must be distinguished from the writ of certiorari that 
may be issued pursuant to the "expanded certiorari jurisdiction"
[252]
 under Article VIII, 
Section 1, paragraph 2 of the 1987 Constitution.
[253]

 The latter is a remedy for breaches of constitutional rights by any 
branch or instrumentality of the government. Meanwhile, the special 
civil action under Rule 65 is limited to a review of judicial and 
quasi-judicial acts. The following summarizes the distinctions between 
the two avenues for certiorari:







 


Certiorari under Rule 65 



Expanded Certiorari 







Basis


Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
 


Article VIII, Section 1, 
paragraph 2 of the Constitution 






Assailed act 



without or in excess of 
jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction 


grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction 






By whom 



any tribunal, board or 
officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions 



any branch or instrumentality
 of the government 






Other 
requisites 


there is no appeal, or any 
plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law 











While these two avenues are distinct, this Court has allowedâin
 view 
of its power to relax its rules of procedureârecourse to petitions for 
certiorari under Rule 65 to enable reliefs that invoke expanded 
certiorari jurisdiction.
[254]


 Regardless, "the expansion of this Court's judicial power is 
by no 
means an abandonment of the need to satisfy the basic requisites of 
justiciability."
[255]
 
Ultimately, the nature of judicial power means that this Court is 
competent to decide legal principles only when there is an actual case 
brought by the proper parties who suffer direct, material, and 
substantial injury.

 
XV


 The special civil actions of petitions for 
certiorari and mandamus cannot afford petitioners the reliefs they seek.

 Rule 65 petitions are not per se remedies to resolve
 
constitutional issues. Instead, they "are filed to address the 
jurisdictional excesses of officers or bodies exercising judicial or 
quasi-judicial functions."
[256]
 Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Court 
provides:



 SECTION 1. 
Petition for certiorari
. â 
When any tribunal, 
board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has 
acted without or in excess its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse 
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is 
no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary 
course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition 
in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that 
judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such 
tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law 
and justice may require.
  


 The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy 
of the 
judgment, order or resolution subject thereof, copies of all pleadings 
and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a sworn certification 
of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of section 3, 
Rule 46. (1a)
  


 The petition shall also contain a sworn certification of 
non-forum
 shopping as provided in the third paragraph of section 3, Rule 46. (3a)
 




A petition for certiorari under Rule 65 will prosper only when 
the 
following requisites are present (1) the writ "must be directed against a
 tribunal, a board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial 
functions"; (2) "the tribunal, board, or officer must have acted without
 or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion"; and 
(3) "there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the 
ordinary course of law."
[257]




 Not every instance of abuse of discretion should lead this 
Court to 
exercise its power of judicial review. The abuse of discretion must be 
grave, amounting to a lack or excess of jurisdiction. 
Sinon v. 
Civil Service Commission
[258]
 explains:



 By grave abuse of discretion is meant such capricious and 
whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.
 The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an 
evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined
 by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is
 exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or 
hostility.
[259]
 
(Citation omitted)
  




 A writ of certiorari is unavailing here. The assailed 
government act
 is the President's withdrawal from the Rome Statute. This, by any 
stretch of the imagination, may not be considered an exercise of 
judicial or quasi-judicial power.

 A political question exists when the issue does not 
call on this
 Court to determine legality and adjudicate, but to interpret the wisdom
 of a law or an act.
[260]
 It 
has been defined as a question "which, under the Constitution, [is] to 
be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to 
which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the Legislature
 or executive branch of the Government."
[261]


 In 
Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. 
Zamora
:
[262]




 One class of cases wherein the Court hesitates to rule on 
are 
"political questions." The reason is that political questions are 
concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom not the legality, of a 
particular act or measure being assailed. Moreover, the political 
question being a function of the separation of powers, the courts will 
not normally interfere with the workings of another co-equal branch 
unless the case shows a clear need for the courts to step in to uphold 
the law and the Constitution.
  


 . . . In the classic formulation of Justice Brennan in 

Baker v. Carr
,
 prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political 
question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of 
the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially 
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the 
impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a 
kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a 
courtâs undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of 
the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need 
for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the
 potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by 
various departments on the one question.
[263]
 (Citation omitted)
  




 Courts cannot resolve a political question. It is not within 
the 
purview of judicial functions, and must be left to the sound discretion 
of the political agentsâthe executive or the legislature. 

 It is true that we have previously said that it is 
wrong to 
mistake matters of foreign relations as political questions, which are 
completely beyond the reach of judicial review. Nevertheless, generally,
 the pursuit of foreign relations is in the executive domain, and thus, 
pertains to the president,
[264]
 the primary architect of foreign policy. As 
explained in 
Bayan v. Zamora
:
[265]




 By constitutional fiat and by the intrinsic nature of his 
office, 
the President, as head of State, is the sole organ and authority in the 
external affairs of the country. In many ways, the President is the 
chief architect of the nation's foreign policy, his "dominance in the 
field of foreign relations is then conceded." Wielding vast powers and 
influence, his conduct in the external affairs of the nation . . . is 
"executive altogether."
[266]
 (Citations omitted)
  




 Between the executive and this Court, it is the executive that
 
represents the Philippines in the international sphere. This Court 
interprets laws hut its determinations are effective only within the 
bounds of Philippine jurisdiction. Even within these bounds, this Court 
must caution itself in interpreting the Constitution and our laws, for 
it can undermine the discretion of the political agencies. This Court's 
mandate is clear: it is the presence of grave abuse of discretion that 
sanctions us to act. It is not merely discretion, but 

abuse
 of that discretion; and it is not only abuse of
 discretion, but 
grave abuse of discretion
. 

 The President's withdrawal from the Rome Statute was
 in 
accordance with the mechanism provided in the treaty. The Rome Statute 
itself contemplated and enabled a State Party's withdrawal. A state 
party and its agents cannot be faulted for merely acting within what the
 Rome Statute expressly allows. 

 As far as established facts go, all there is for 
this Court to 
rely on are the manifest actions of the executive, which have 
nonetheless all been consistent with the letter of the Rome Statute. 
Suggestions have been made about supposed political motivations, but 
they remain just that: suggestions and suppositions. 

 Were the situation differentâwhere it is shown that 
the 
President's exercise of discretion ran afoul of established procedure; 
or was done in manifest disregard of previously declared periods for 
rectification, terms, guidelines, or injunctions, belying any rhyme or 
reason in the course of action hastily and haphazardly taken; or was 
borne out of vindictiveness, as retaliation, merely out of personal 
motives, to please personal tastes or to placate personal perceived 
injuriesâwhimsical and arbitrary exercise of discretion may be 
appreciated, impelling this Court to rule on the substance of petitions 
and grant the reliefs sought.

 
XVI


 Rule 65, Section 3 of the Rules of Court provides: 



 SECTION 3. 
Petition for mandamus
. â When 
any tribunal, 
corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the 
performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty 
resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes 
another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such 
other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate 
remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may 
tile a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with 
certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the 
respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the 
court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the 
petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason
 of the wrongful acts of the respondent. 
  




 
Lihaylihay v. Treasurer of the 
Philippines
[267]
 discussed the requisites for the issuance of a
 writ of mandamus:



 A writ of mandamus may issue in either of two (2) 
situations: 
first, "when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person 
unlawfully 
neglects
 the performance of an act which 
the law 
specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or 
station"; second, "when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or 
person . . . 
unlawfully excludes another
 from the use
 and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled."
  


 The first situation demands a concurrence between a clear 
legal 
right accruing to petitioner and a correlative duty incumbent upon 
respondents to perform an act, this duty being imposed upon them by law.
  


 Petitioner's legal right must have already been clearly 
established. It cannot be a prospective entitlement that is yet to be 
settled. In 
Lim Tay v. Court of Appeals
, this Court 
emphasized 
that "[m]andamus will not issue to establish a right, but only to 
enforce one that is already established." In 
Pefianco v. 
Moral
, this Court underscored that a writ of mandamus "never 
issues in doubtful cases."
  


 Respondents must also be shown to have 

actually
 neglected 
to perform the act mandated by law. Clear in the text of Rule 65, 
Section 3 is the requirement that respondents "unlawfully 

neglect
" the performance of a duty. The mere 
existence of a legally mandated duty or the pendency of its performance 
does not suffice. 
  


 The duty subject of mandamus must be ministerial rather than
 
discretionary. A court cannot subvert legally vested authority for a 
body or officer to exercise discretion. In 
Sy Ha v. 
Galang
: 
  




 [M]andamus will not issue to control the exercise of 
discretion 
of a public officer where the law imposes upon him the duty to exercise 
his judgment in reference to any matter in which he is required to act, 
because it is his judgment that is to be exercised and not that of the 
court. 
    




 This Court distinguished discretionary functions from 
ministerial 
duties, and related the exercise of discretion to judicial and 
quasi-judicial powers. In 
Samson v. Barrios
: 
  




 Discretion, when applied to public functionaries, means a 
power 
or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under certain 
circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgments and 
consciences, uncontrolled by the judgments or consciences of others. A 
purely ministerial act or duty, in contradistinction to a discretional 
act, is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of 
facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal 
authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment, upon 
the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty 
upon a public officer, and gives him the right to decide how or when the
 duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not 
ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same
 requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment. . . .
 Mandamus will not lie to control the exercise of discretion of an 
inferior tribunal . . . , when the act complained of is either judicial 
or quasi-judicial. . . . It is the proper remedy when the case presented
 is outside of the exercise of judicial discretion. . . . 
    




 Mandamus, too, will not issue unless it is shown that "there
 is no
 other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."
 This is a requirement basic to all remedies under Rule 65, i.e., 
certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.
[268]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
  




 A writ of mandamus lies to compel the performance of duties 
that are
 purely ministerial, and not those that are discretionary. Petitioners 
must show that they have a clear legal right and that there was a 
neglected duty which was incumbent upon the public officer. 

 Here, however, there is no showing that the 
President has the 
ministerial duty imposed by law to retract his withdrawal from the Rome 
Statute. Certainly, there is no constitutional or statutory provision 
granting petitioners the right to compel the executive to withdraw from 
any treaty. It was discretionary upon the President, as primary 
architect of our foreign policy, to perform the assailed act. 

 Moreover, issuing a writ of mandamus will not 

ipso facto 
restore
 the Philippines to membership in the International Criminal Court. No 
provision in the Rome Statute directs how a state party may reverse its 
withdrawal from the treaty. It cannot be guaranteed that the Note 
Verbale's depositary, the United Nations Secretary-General, will assent 
to this Court's compulsion to reverse the country's withdrawal. 

 This Court is not an international court. It may 
only rule on 
the effect of international law on the domestic sphere. What is within 
its purview is not the effectivity of laws among states, but the effect 
of international law on the Constitution and our municipal laws. Not 
only do petitioners pray for a relief directed at a discretionary 
function, but the relief they seek through this Court's finite authority
 is ineffectual and futile. Ultimately, mandamus will not lie. 

 
XVII


 
Pacta sunt servanda
 is a 
generally accepted principle of 
international law that preserves the sanctity of treaties. This 
principle is expressed in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention: 

 Article 26
 
  "Pacta sunt servanda"



 Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and 
must be performed by them in good faith. 
  




 A supplementary provision is found in Article 46: 





 Article 46 

    Provisions of internal law regarding 

    competence to conclude treaties 
  


 1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be 
bound by
 a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal
 law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its 
consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its 
internal law of fundamental importance. 
  


 2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively 
evident to 
any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal 
practice and in good faith. 
  




 A state party may not invoke the provisions of its internal 
law to 
justify its failure to perform a treaty. Under international law, we 
cannot plead our own laws to excuse our noncompliance with our 
obligations. 

 The March 15, 2018 Note Verbale submitted by the 
Department of 
Foreign Affairs, through our Ambassador to the United Nations, partly 
reads: 



 The Government of the Republic of the Philippines has the 
honor to
 inform the Secretary-General, in his capacity as depositary of the Rome
 Statute of the International Criminal Court, of its decision to 
withdraw from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 

in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
Statute
. 
  


 The Philippines assures the community of nations that the 
Philippine Government continues to be guided by the rule of law embodied
 in its Constitution, which also enshrines the country's 

long-standing tradition of upholding human rights.




 The Government 
affirms its commitment to fight 
against impunity

 for atrocity crimes, notwithstanding its withdrawal from the Rome 
Statute, especially since the Philippines has a national legislation 
punishing atrocity crimes. The Government remains resolute in effecting 
its principal responsibility to ensure the long-term safety of the 
nation in order to promote inclusive national development and secure a 
decent and dignified life for all. 
  


 The decision to withdraw is the Philippines' principled 
stand against those who politicize and weaponize human rights, 

even
 as its independent and well-functioning organs and agencies continue to
 exercise jurisdiction over complaints, issues, problems and concerns 
arising from its efforts to protect its people
.
[269]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
  




 The Philippines' withdrawal was submitted 
in 
accordance with relevant provisions of the Rome Statute
. The 
President complied with the provisions of the treaty from which the 
country withdrew. There cannot be a violation of 
pacta sunt 
servanda

 when the executive acted precisely in accordance with the procedure 
laid out by that treaty. Article 127(1) of the Rome Statute states: 

 A State Party may, by written 
notification addressed to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, withdraw from this Statute. The
 withdrawal shall take effect one year after the date of receipt of the 
notification, unless the notification specifies a later date. 
  


 From its text, the Rome Statute provides no room to reverse 
the 
accepted withdrawal from it. While there is a one-year period before the
 withdrawal takes effect, it is unclear whether we can read into that 
proviso a permission for a state party to rethink its position, and 
retreat from its withdrawal. 

 In any case, this Court has no competence to 
interpret with 
finalityâlet alone bind the International Criminal Court, the Assembly 
of States Parties, individual state parties, and the entire 
international communityâwhat this provision means, and conclude that 
undoing a withdrawal is viable. In the face of how the Rome Statute 
enables withdrawal but does not contemplate the undoing of a withdrawal,
 this Court cannot compel external recognition of any prospective 
undoing which it shall order. To do so could even mean courting 
international embarrassment. 

 Just the same, any such potential embarrassment or 
other 
unpalatable consequences arc risks that we, as a country, are willing to
 take is better left to those tasked with crafting foreign policy.

 The Rome Statute contemplates amendments, and is 
replete with provisions on it: 



 
Article 121 

    Amendments




 After the expiry of seven years from the entry 
into force of 
this Statute, any State Party may propose amendments thereto. The text 
of any proposed amendment shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of
 the United Nations, who shall promptly circulate it to all States 
Parties.
 No sooner than three months from the date 
of notification, the 
Assembly of States Parties, at its next meeting, shall, by a majority of
 those present and voting, decide whether to take up the proposal. The 
Assembly may deal with the proposal directly or convene a Review 
Conference if the issue involved so warrants. 
The 
adoption of an amendment at a meeting of the Assembly of 
States Parties or at a Review Conference which consensus cannot be 
reached shall require a two-thirds majority States 
Parties.
Except as provided in paragraph 5, an 
amendment shall enter into
 force for all States Parties one year after instruments of ratification
 or acceptance have been deposited with the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations by seven-eighths of them.
Any 
amendment to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Statute shall 
enter into force for those States Parties which have accepted the 
amendment one year after the deposit of their instruments of 
ratification or acceptance. In respect of a State Party which has not 
accepted the amendment, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction 
regarding a crime covered by the amendment when committed by that State 
Party's nationals or on its territory.
 If an 
amendment has been accepted by seven-eighths of States 
Parties in accordance with paragraph 4, any State Party which has not 
accepted the amendment may withdraw from this Statute with immediate 
effect, notwithstanding article 127, paragraph 1, but subject to article
 127, paragraph 2, by giving notice no later than one year after the 
entry into force of such amendment. 
The 
Secretary-General of the United Nations shall circulate to 
all States Parties any amendment adopted at a meeting of the Assembly of
 States Parties or at a Review Conference.
    


 
Article 122 

    Amendments to provisions of an institutional nature




  Amendments to provisions of this Statute which 
are of an 
exclusively institutional nature, namely, article 35, article 36, 
paragraphs 8 and 9, article 37, article 38, article 39, paragraphs 1 
(first two sentences), 2 and 4, article 42, paragraphs 4 to 9, article 
43, paragraphs 2 and 3, and articles 44, 46, 47 and 49, may be proposed 
at any time, notwithstanding article 121, paragraph 1, by any State 
Party. The text of any proposed amendment shall be submitted to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations or such other person designated 
by the Assembly of States Parties who shall promptly circulate it to all
 States Parties and to others participating in the Assembly. 

Amendments under this article in which consensus 
cannot be 
reached shall be adopted by the Assembly of States Parties or by a 
Review Conference, by a two-thirds majority of States Parties. Such 
amendments shall enter into force for all States Parties six months 
after their adoption by the Assembly of, as the case may be, by the 
Conference. 
    


 
Article 123 

    Review of Statute




  Seven years after the entry into force of this 
Statute the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations shall convene a Review 
Conference to consider any amendments to this Statute. Such review may 
include, but is not limited to, the list of crimes contained in article 
5. The Conference shall be open to those participating in the Assembly 
of State Parties and on the same conditions.
At any 
time thereafter, at the request of a State Party and for 
the purposes set out in paragraph 1, the Secretary-General of the United
 Nations shall, upon approval by a majority of States Parties, convene a
 Review Conference. 
The provisions of article 121, 
paragraphs 3 to 7, shall apply to
 the adoption and entry into force of any amendment to the Statute 
considered in a Review Conference.
    




 Generally, 
jus cogens 
rules of customary 
international law 
cannot be amended by treaties. As Articles 121, 122, and 123 allow the 
amendment of provisions of the Rome Statute, this indicates that the 
Rome Statute is not 
jus cogens
. At best, its 
provisions are 
articulations of customary law, or simply, treaty law. Article 121(6) 
sanctions the immediate withdrawal of a state party if it does not agree
 with the amending provisions of the Rome Statute. Therefore, withdrawal
 from the Rome Statute is not aberrant. Precisely, the option is enabled
 for states parties. 

 Petitioners' contentionâthat withdrawing from the 
Rome Statute 
effectively repeals a lawâis inaccurate. The Rome Statute remained in 
force for its states parties, and Article 127 specifically allows state 
parties to withdraw. 

 In withdrawing from the Rome Statute, the President 
complied 
with the treaty's requirements. Compliance with its textual provisions 
cannot be susceptible of an interpretation that his act violated the 
treaty. Hence, withdrawal per se from the Rome Statute does not violate 

pacta sunt servanda
. 

 
XVIII


 Petitioners in G.R. No. 239483 invoke the case of 
South Africa, 
which had previously attempted to withdraw from the Rome Statute. When 
the withdrawal was challenged by the South African Opposition Democratic
 Alliance, the South African High Court ruled that the president's 
withdrawal was premature, procedurally irrational, and may not be done 
without the approval of the Parliament. It said: 



 The matter was argued largely on the basis that there is no 
provision in the Constitution or in any other legislation for withdrawal
 from international treaties. . . . However, it appears to us that there
 is probably a good reason why the Constitution provides for the power 
of the executive to negotiate and conclude international agreements but 
is silent on the power to terminate them. The reason is this: As the 
executing arm of the state, the national executive needs authority to 
act. That authority will flow from the Constitution or from an act of 
parliament. The national executive can exercise only those powers and 
perform those functions conferred upon it by the Constitution, or by law
 which is consistent with the Constitution. This is a basic requirement 
of the principle of legality and the rule of law. The absence of a 
provision in the Constitution or any other legislation of a power for 
the executive to terminate international agreements is therefore 
confirmation of the fact that such power does not exist unless and until
 parliament legislates for it. It is not a lacuna or omission.
[270]






 The ruling on South Africa's withdrawal cannot be taken as 
binding precedent.

 First, foreign judgments are not binding in our 
jurisdiction. At most, they may hold persuasive value.
[271]
 
Francisco 
v. House of Representatives
[272]

 teaches that this Court, in passing upon constitutional questions, 
"should not be beguiled by foreign jurisprudence some of which are 
hardly applicable because they have been dictated by different 
constitutional settings and needs."
[273]


 Second, a comparison of the Philippines' and South 
Africa's 
respective governmental structures and constitutions reveals stark 
differences. 

 Our Constitution states: "No treaty or international
 agreement 
shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds 
of all the members of the Senate."
[274]


 On the other hand, the South African Constitution 
provides:



 SECTION 231. International Agreements







(1)


The negotiating 
and signing of all international agreements is the responsibility of the
 national executive














(2)


An international agreement 
binds the Republic 
only after it has been approved by 
resolution in both the National Assembly and the National Council of 
Provinces
, unless it is an agreement referred to in subsection
 (3).
[275]
 
(Emphasis supplied)








Our Constitution requires that when the president enters into a
 treaty, at least two-thirds of all members of the Senate must 

concur

 for it to be valid and effective. On the other hand, the South African 
Constitution expressly requires that the entire parliament must 

approve
 the international agreement.


 Per our system of checks and balances, the Senate concurred 
with 
entering into the Rome Statute through Senate Resolution No. 546. In 
contrast, the South African parliament had to enact a law, the 
Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
Act 27 of 2002,
[276]
 for the 
Rome Statute to be adopted in South Africa. Thus, treaty-making in South
 Africa is vested in their parliament, making it a concurrently 
legislative and not an exclusively executive act. In the Philippines, 
treaty-making is an executive act, vested in the president; the Senate's
 involvement is limited to mere concurrence. 

 While there may be similarities between our 
constitutions, these
 are not enough to take South Africa's case as binding precedent. We are
 under a presidential form of government. The way our system of checks 
and balances operates is different from how such a system would operate m
 a parliamentary government. 

 
XIX


 Withdrawing from the Rome Statute does not discharge
 a state 
party from the obligations it has incurred as a member. Article 127(2) 
provides: 



 
A State shall not be discharged, by reason of its 
withdrawal, 
from the obligations arising from this Statute while it was as a Party 
to the Statute
, including any financial obligations which may 
have 
accrued. Its withdrawal shall not affect any cooperation with the Court 
in connection with criminal investigations and proceedings in relation 
to which the withdrawing State had a duty to cooperate and which were 
commenced prior to the date on which the withdrawal became effective, 
nor shall it prejudice in any way the continued consideration of any 
matter which was already under consideration by the Court prior to the 
date on which the withdrawal became effective. (Emphasis supplied) 
  




 A state party withdrawing from the Rome Statute must still 
comply 
with this provision. Even if it has deposited the instrument of 
withdrawal, it shall not be discharged from any criminal proceedings. 
Whatever process was already initiated before the International Criminal
 Court obliges the state party to cooperate. 

 Until the withdrawal took effect on March 17, 2019, 
the 
Philippines was committed to meet its obligations under the Rome 
Statute. Any and all governmental acts up to March 17, 2019 may be taken
 cognizance of by the International Criminal Court. 

 Further, as petitioners in G.R. No. 239483 
underscored: 



 [U]nder this reverse complementarity provision in [Republic 
Act 
No. 9851], the Preliminary Examination opened by the [International 
Criminal Court] on the President's drug war is not exactly 

haram
 
(to borrow a word used in Islam to mean any act forbidden by the 
Divine). Assuming such a [Preliminary Examination] proceeds . . . when 
Art. 18 (3) of the Rome Statute comes into play, [Republic Ad No. 9851] 
may be invoked as basis by Philippine authorities to defer instead to 
the [International Criminal Court] in respect of any investigation on 
the .same situation.
[277]






 Consequently, liability for the alleged summary killings and 
other 
atrocities committed in the course of the war on drugs is not nullified 
or negated here. The Philippines remained covered and bound by the Rome 
Statute until March 17, 2019. 

 
XX


 Petitioners claim that the country's withdrawal from
 the Rome 
Statute violated their right to be provided with ample remedies for the 
protection of their right to life and security. 

 This fear of imagined diminution of legal remedies 
must be 
assuaged. The Constitution, which embodies our fundamental rights, was 
in no way abrogated by the withdrawal. A litany of statutes that protect
 our rights remain in place and enforceable. 

 As discussed, Republic Act No. 9851 or the 
Philippine Act on 
Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide, and Other 
Crimes Against Humanity, echoes the substantive provisions of the Rome 
Statue. It was signed into law on December 11, 2009, two years before 
the Senate concurred with the Rome Statute. Republic Act No. 9851 covers
 rights similarly protected under the Rome Statute. Consequently, no new
 obligations arose from our membership in the International Criminal 
Court. Given the variances between the Rome Statute and Republic Act No.
 9851, it may even be said that the Rome Statute amended Republic Act 
No. 9851. 

 Republic Act No. 9851 declares the State policy of 
valuing "the 
dignity of every human person and guarantee[ing] full respect for human 
rights, including the rights of indigenous cultural communities and 
other vulnerable groups, such as women and children[.]"
[278]

 It guarantees protection against "the most serious crimes of concern to
 the international community as a whole . . . and their effective 
prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level in 
order to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these 
crime[.]
[279]
 It 
recognizes that the State must "
exercise its criminal 
jurisdiction over those responsible for international 
crimes
[.]"
[280]


 This is enforced by the Republic Act No. 9851's 
assertion of jurisdiction over crimes committed anywhere in the world:



 SECTION 17. 
Jurisdiction
. â The State 
shall exercise 
jurisdiction over persons, whether military or civilian, suspected or 
accused of a crime defined and penalized in this Act, regardless of 
where the crime is committed, provided, any one of the following 
conditions is met:
  








(a)


 
The accused is
 a Filipino citizen;






(b)


The accused, regardless of 
citizenship or residence, is present in the Philippines; or 







(c)


The accused has committed 
the said crime against a Filipino citizen.








In the interest of justice, the relevant Philippine 
authorities may
 dispense with the investigation or prosecution of a crime punishable 
under this Act if another court or international tribunal is already 
conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such 
crime. Instead, the authorities may surrender or extradite suspected or 
accused persons in the Philippines to the appropriate international 
court, if any, or to another State pursuant to the applicable 
extradition laws and treaties.


 No criminal proceedings shall be initiated against foreign 
nationals suspected or accused of having committed the crimes defined 
and penalized in this Act if they have been tried by a competent court 
outside the Philippines in respect of the same offense and acquitted, or
 having been convicted, already served their sentence.
[281]






 Republic Act No. 9851 expressly confers original and exclusive
 
jurisdiction on regional trial courts over the offenses it punishes. It 
also provides that this Court shall designate special courts to try 
these cases.
[282]


Unlike 
the Rome Statute, Republic Act No. 9851 dispenses with complementarity 
as a requirement for prosecution of crimes against humanity
.

 Notably, Republic Act No. 9851 proclaims as state 
policy the 
protection of human rights of the accused, the victims, and the 
witnesses, and provides for accessible and gender-sensitive avenues of 
redress:



 The State shall guarantee persons suspected or accused of 
having 
committed grave crimes under international law all rights necessary to 
ensure that their trial will he fair and prompt in strict accordance 
with national and international law and standards for fair trial, It 
shall also protect victims, witnesses and their families, and provide 
appropriate redress to victims and their families.. It shall ensure that
 the legal systems in place provide accessible and gender-sensitive 
avenues of redress for victims of armed conflict[.]
[283]






 These State policies are operationalized in the following 
provisions:



 SECTION 13. 
Protection of Victims and 
Witnesses
. â In 
addition to existing provisions in Philippine law for the protection of 
victims and witnesses, the following measures shall be undertaken:









(a)


The Philippine 
court shall 
take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and 
physiological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. 
In so doing, the court shall have regard of all relevant factors, 
including age, gender and health, and the nature of the crime, in 
particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or 
gender violence or violence against children. The prosecutor shall take 
such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of 
such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent 
with the rights of the accused and to a fair and impartial trial; 







(b)


As an exception to the 
general 
principle of public hearings, the court may, to protect the victims and 
witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera 
or allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special 
means. In particular, such measures shall be implemented in the case of 
the victim of sexual violence or a child who is a victim or is a 
witness, unless otherwise ordered by the court, having regard to all the
 circumstances, particularly the views of the victim or witness; 







(c)


Where the personal 
interests of the 
victims are affected, the court shall permit their views and concerns to
 be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to 
be appropriate by the court in manner which is not prejudicial to or 
inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial 
trial. Such views and concerns may be presented by the legal 
representatives of the victims where the court considers it appropriate 
in accordance with the established rules of procedure and evidence; and 







(d)


Where the disclosure of 
evidence or 
information pursuant to this Act may lead to the grave endangerment of 
the security of a witness for his/her family, the prosecution may, for 
the purposes of any proceedings conducted prior to the commencement of 
the trial; withhold such evidence or information and instead submit a 
summary thereof. Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is 
not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and to
 a fair and impartial trial.








SECTION 14. 
Reparations to Victims
. â In 
addition to 
existing provisions in Philippine law and procedural rules for 
reparations to victims, the following measures shall be undertaken: 









(a)


The court shall
 follow the 
principles relating to the reparations to, or in respect of, victims, 
including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, 
in its decision, the court may, wither upon request or on its own motion
 in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any 
damage, loss and injury to, or in respect of, victims and state the 
principles on which it is acting: 






(b)


The court may make an order
 directly 
against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or in 
respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and 
rehabilitation; and






(c)


Before making an order 
under this 
section, the court may invite and shall take account of representations 
from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims or other interested 
persons. 








Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as prejudicing 
the rights of victims under national or international law.
[284]
 




 Chapter III
[285]
 of 
Republic Act No. 9851 defines war crimes, genocide, and other crimes 
against humanity, as similarly characterized in the Rome Statute.

 
However, there are significant 
differences between the Rome Statute and Republic Act No. 
9851.


 Republic Act No. 9851 defines torture as "the 
intentional 
infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical, mental, or 
psychological, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the 
accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising
 only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions."
[286]

 Meanwhile, psychological means of torture are not covered by the Rome 
Statute. This is also a departure from Republic Act No. 9745, or the 
Anti-Torture Act of 2009, which limits torture to those "inflicted by or
 at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a person 
in authority or agent of a person in authority"
[287]
 for specific purposes.

 Republic Act No. 9851 clustered war crimes or crimes
 against 
international humanitarian law into three categories: (1) an 
international armed conflict; (2) a non-international armed conflict; 
and (3) other serious violations of laws and customs applicable in armed
 conflict. It then listed specific acts against protected persons or 
properties, or against persons taking no active part in hostilities. The
 broader definition of war crimes under Republic Act No. 9851 as 
compared with the Rome Statute is emphasized below:



 SECTION 4. 
War Crimes
. â- For the purpose
 of this Act, "war crimes" or "crimes against International Humanitarian
 Law" means:
  




 (a) In case of an international armed conflict, grave 
breaches 
of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely, any of the 
following acts against persons or property protected under the 
provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention:



. . . . 




 (6) 
Arbitrary
 
deportation or forcible transfer of population or unlawful 
confinement;
 
        (7) Taking of hostages; 

        (8) Compelling a prisoner of war or other protected person to 
serve in the forces of a hostile power; and
 
        (9) 
Unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of
 prisoners of war or other protected persons.








 (b) In case of a non-international armed conflict, serious 
violations of common Article 3 to the four (4) Geneva Conventions of 12 
August 1949, namely, any of the following acts committed against persons
 taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of the 
armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed 

hors de combat
 by sickness, wounds, detention or any 
other cause:
  




 (1) Violence to life and person, in particular, 

willful killings
, mutilation, 
cruel treatment and torture;
 
      . . . .
    


 (3) Intentionally directing attacks against buildings, 
material,
 medical units and transport, and personnel using the distinctive 
emblems of the Geneva Conventions 
or Additional 
Protocol III
 in conformity with international law; 
    


. . . .
    


 (6) 
Launching an attack against works or
 installations 
containing dangerous forces in the knowledge that such attack will cause
 excessive loss of life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian 
objects, and causing death or serious injury to body or 
health;




 . . . .
    


 18) Killing or wounding 
a person in the 
knowledge that he/she is hors de combat, including
 a
 combatant who, having laid down his/her arms or no longer having means 
of defense, has surrendered at discretion;

 
      (9) Making improper use of a flag of truce, of the flag or the 
military insignia and uniform of the enemy or of the United Nations, as 
well as of the distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions or other 
protective signs under International Humanitarian Law, resulting in 
death, serious personal injury 
or 
capture;




 . . . .
    


 (12) Killing, wounding 
or capturing an 
adversary by resort to perfidy;




 . . . .
    


 (19) Committing rape, sexual slavery, enforced 
prostitution, 
forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual 
violence also constituting a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions 
o
r a serious violation of common Article 3 to 
the
 Geneva Conventions;
    


 . . . .
    


 (21) Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a 
method of 
warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, 
including willfully impeding relief supplies as provided for under the 
Geneva Convention 
and their Additional 
Protocols;




 . . . .
    


 (24) Committing any of the following acts;
    




 (i) Conscripting, enlisting 
or 
recruiting
 children under the age of fifteen (15) 
years into the national armed forces; 

        (ii) Conscripting, enlisting 
or 
recruiting
 children under the age of 

eighteen (18) years into an armed force or group other
 than the national armed forces
; and
 
        (iii) Using children under the age of 
eighteen
 (18) years
 to participate actively in hostilities; 
and
      


 . . . .
      




 
Any person found guilty of committing 
any of the acts 
specified herein shall suffer the penalty provided under Section 7 of 
this Act.
[288]
 (Emphasis supplied)
    






 Acts of willful killing, as opposed to "murder" under the Rome
 
Statute, deportation or forcible transfer of populations, torture, and 
the sexual offenses under the third category of war crimes are also 
listed as "other crimes against humanity" under Republic Act No. 9851.

 
Unlike the Rome Statute, Republic 
Act No. 9851 also adds 
or includes among other crimes against humanity persecution against any 
individual, group, or collectivity based on their sexual 
orientation.
 
Enforced or 
"involuntary disappearance of persons" is also a punishable crime 
against humanity.
[289]


 Republic Act No. 9851 holds superiors liable as 
principals for 
crimes committed by subordinates under their effective command and 
control.
[290]
 This
 provides for command responsibility "as a form of criminal complicity" 
that jurisprudence has recognized:
[291]




 In other words, command responsibility may be loosely 
applied in 
amparo
 cases in order
 
to
 
identify
 those accountable individuals 
that have the power to effectively implement whatever processes an 

amparo
 court would issue. In such application, the 

amparo

 court does not impute criminal responsibility but merely pinpoint the 
superiors it considers to be in the best position to protect the rights 
of the aggrieved party.
  


 Such identification of the responsible and accountable 
superiors 
may well be a preliminary determination of criminal liability which, of 
course, is still subject to further investigation by the appropriate 
government agency. 
  


 Relatedly, the legislature came up with Republic Act No. 
98)1 to 
include command responsibility as a form of criminal complicity in 
crimes against international humanitarian law, genocide and other 
crimes. 
RA 9851 is thus the substantive law that definitively 
imputes
 criminal liability to those superiors who, despite their position, 
still fail to take all necessary and reasonable measures within their 
power to prevent or repress the commission of illegal acts or to submit 
these matters to the competent authorities for investigation and 
prosecution
.
[292]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
  




 All told, the more restrictive Rome Statute may have even 
weakened 
the substantive protections already previously afforded by Republic Act 
No. 9851. In such a case, it may well be beneficial to remove the 
confusion brought about by maintaining a treaty whose contents are 
inconsistent with antecedent statutory provisions.

 
XXI


 It has been opined that the principles of law in the
 Rome 
Statute are generally accepted principles of international law. Assuming
 that this is true and considering the incorporation clause, the 
Philippines' withdrawal from the Rome Statute would be a superfluity 
thus, ultimately ineffectual. The Philippines would remain bound by 
obligations expressed in the Rome Statute:



 [G]enerally accepted principles of international law form 
part of 
Philippine laws even if they do not derive from treaty obligations of 
the Philippines.
  


 . . . .
  


 Some customary international laws have been affirmed and 
embodied 
in treaties and conventions. A treaty constitutes evidence of customary 
law if it is declaratory of customary law, or if it is intended to 
codify customary law. 
In such a case, even a State not party to
 the 
treaty would be bound thereby. A treaty which is merely a formal 
expression of customary international law is enforceable on all States 
because of their membership in the family of nations
. For 
instance, 
the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations to binding even on non-party
 States because the provisions of the Convention are mostly codified 
rules of customary international law binding on all States even before 
their codification into the Vienna Convention. Another example is the 
Law of the Sea, which consists mostly of codified rules of customary 
international law, which have been universally observed even before the 
Law of the Sea was ratified by participating States.
  


 Corollarily, treaties may become the basis of customary 
international law. While States which are not parties to treaties or 
international agreements are not bound thereby, such agreements, if 
widely accepted for years by many States, may transform into customary 
international laws, in which case, they bind even non-signatory States.
  


 In 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan
, this Court 
held that even in 
the absence of the Constitution, generally accepted principles of 
international law remain part of the laws of the Philippines. During the
 interregnum, or the period after the actual takeover of power by the 
revolutionary government in the Philippines, following the cessation of 
resistance by loyalist forces up to 24 March 1986 (immediately before 
the adoption of the Provisional Constitution), the 1973 Philippine 
Constitution was abrogated and there was no municipal law higher than 
the directives and orders of the revolutionary government. Nevertheless,
 this Court ruled that even during this period, the provisions of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights to which the Philippines is a signatory, 
remained in effect in the country. The Covenant and Declaration are 
based on generally accepted principles of international law which are 
applicable in the Philippines even in the absence of a constitution, as 
during the interregnum. Consequently, applying the provisions of the 
Covenant and the Declaration, the Filipino people continued to enjoy 
almost the same rights found in the Bill of Rights despite the 
abrogation of the 1973 Constitution.
  


 The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was 
adopted 
by 120 members of the United Nations (UN) on 17 July 1998. It entered 
into force on 1 July 2002, after 60 States became party to the Statute 
through ratification or accession. The adoption of the Rome Statute 
fulfilled the international community's long-time dream of creating a 
permanent international tribunal to try serious international crimes. 
The Rome Statute, which established an international criminal court and 
formally declared genocide, war crimes and other crimes against humanity
 as serious international crimes, 
codified generally accepted 
principles of international law, including customary international 
laws
.
 The principles of law embodied in the Rome Statute were already 
generally accepted principles of international law even prior to the 
adoption of the Statute. Subsequently, the Rome Statute itself has been 
widely accepted and, as of November 2010, it has been ratified by 114 
states, 113 of which are members of the UN.
  


 There are at present 192 members of the UN. Since 113 member
 
states have already ratified the Rome Statute, more than a majority of 
all the UN members have now adopted the Rome Statute as part of their 
municipal laws. Thus, the Rome Statute itself is generally accepted by 
the Community of nations as constituting a body of generally accepted 
principles of international law. 
The principles of law found 
in the 
Rome Statute constitute generally accepted principles of international 
law enforceable in the Philippines under the Philippine Constitution. 

The
 principles of law embodied in the Rome Statute are binding on the 
Philippines even if the Statute has yet to be ratified by the Philippine
 Senate. In short, the principles of law enunciated in the Rome Statute 
are now part of Philippine domestic law pursuant to Section 2 , Article 
II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.

 Chapter VII, Section 15 of Republic Act No. 9851 enumerates 
the 
applicable sources of international law that guide its interpretation 
and implementation:



 SECTION 15. 
Applicability of International 
Law.
 â In the application and interpretation of this Act, 
Philippine courts shall be guided by the following sources:









(a)


The 1948 
Genocide Convention; 






(b)


 
The 1949 Geneva 
Conventions I-IV, their 1977 Additional Protocols I and II and their 
2005 Additional Protocol III;






(c)


The 1954 Hague Convention 
for the 
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, its 
First Protocol and its 1999 Second Protocol;






(d)


 
The 1989 Convention on the
 Rights of the Child and its 2000 optional Protocol on the Involvement 
of Children in Armed Conflict; 






(e)


The rules and principles of
 customary international law; 






(f)


 
The judicial decisions of 
international courts and trbunals; 






(g)


 
Relevant and applicable 
international human rights instruments;






(h)


Other relevant 
international treaties and conventions ratified or acceded to by the 
Republic of the Philippines; and






(i)


 
Teachings of the most 
highly qualified
 publicists and authoritative commentaries on the foregoing sources as 
subsidiary means for the determination of rules of international 
law.










As listed by the Office of the Solicitor General, the 
Philippines 
also remained as state party to these international conventions and 
human rights instruments:








(a)


The International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;






(b)


The International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights;






(c)


The Convention Against 
Torture; 






(d)


The Convention on the 
Discrimination Against Women; an Elimination of Discrimination; and 







(e)


The Convention on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
[294]
 








Thus, petitionerâs concern that the country's withdrawal from 
the 
Rome Statute abjectly and reversibly subverts our basic human rights 
appears to be baseless and purely speculative.

 All told, the consolidated Petitions are dismissed 
for failing 
to demonstrate justiciability. While we commend the zealousness of 
petitioners in seeking to ensure that the President acts within the 
bounds of the Constitution, they had no standing to file their suits. We
 cannot grant the reliefs they seek. The unfolding of events, including 
the International Criminal Courtâs acknowledgment of withdrawal even 
before the lapse of one year from initial notice, rendered the 
Petitions' moot, removing any potential relief from this Courtâs sphere.

 Mechanisms that safeguard human rights and protect 
against the 
grave offenses sought to be addressed by the Rome Statute remain 
formally in place in this jurisdiction. Further, the International 
Criminal Court retains jurisdiction over any and all acts committed by 
government actors until March 17, 2019. Hence, withdrawal from the Rome 
Statute does not affect the liabilities of individuals charged before 
the International Criminal Court for acts committed up to this date.

 As guide for future cases, this Court recognizes 
that, as 
primary architect of foreign policy, the President enjoys a degree of 
leeway to withdraw from treaties which are bona fide deemed contrary to 
the Constitution or our laws, and to withdraw in keeping with the 
national policy adopted pursuant to the Constitution and our laws.

 However, the President's discretion to withdraw is 
qualified by 
the extent of legislative involvement on the manner by which a treaty 
was entered into or came into effect. The President cannot unilaterally 
withdraw from treaties that were entered into pursuant to the 
legislative intent manifested in prior laws, or subsequently affirmed by
 succeeding laws. Treaties where Senate concurrence for accession is 
expressly premised on the same concurrence for withdrawal likewise 
cannot be the subject of unilateral withdrawal. The imposition of Senate
 concurrence as a condition may be made piecemeal, through individual. 
Senate resolutions pertaining to specific treaties, or through 
encompassing legislative action, such as a law, a joint resolution by 
Congress, or a comprehensive Senate resolution.

 Ultimately, the exercise of discretion to withdraw 
from treaties
 and international agreements is susceptible to judicial review in cases
 attended by grave abuse of discretion, as when there is no clear, 
definite, or reliable showing of repugnance to the Constitution or our 
statutes, or in cases of inordinate unilateral withdrawal violating 
requisite legislative involvement. Nevertheless, any attempt to invoke 
the power of judicial review must conform to the basic requisites of 
justiciability. Such attempt can only proceed when attended by incidents
 demonstrating a properly justiciable controversy.
