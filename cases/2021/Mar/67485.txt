INTING, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated July 20, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated January 23, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 
08394-MIN. The assailed Decision and Resolution affirmed the Decision
[4]
 dated June 30, 2017 and the Resolution
[5]

 dated September 27, 2017 of the National Labor Relations Commission 
(NLRC) in NLRC No. MAC-03-014836- 2017 (RAB-XI-11-00803-16) which 
reversed the Decision
[6]
 dated January 25, 2017 of the Labor Arbiter (LA) ana ruled that there was valid dismissal from employment.


The Antecedents


The case stemmed from a complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for payment of holiday pay, overtime pay, proportionate 13
th

 month pay, service incentive leave and separation pay filed by Nilo D. 
Lafuente (Lafuente) and Billy C. Panaguiton (Panaguiton) (collectively, 
petitioners) against Davao Central Warehouse Club, Inc. (DCWCI) and Lily
 S. Yap (Yap) (collectively, respondents).
[7]


DCWCI hired Lafuente in 1993 as Dispatching-in-Charge. On the other 
hand, DCWCI hired Panaguiton in 1995 as Lafuente's Assistant Dispatcher.
[8]


On September 5, 2016, DCWCI issued a preventive suspension against 
petitioners through a Notice of Preventive Suspension with Investigation
 Hearing.
[9]
 DCWCI immediately placed them under preventive suspension and charged them with 
"Gross and Habitual Neglect by the Employee of His Duties"
 and for 
"Fraud/Willfull Breach by the Employee of the Trust Reposed on Him by His Employer."

 DCWCI further required them to explain in writing why they should not 
be administratively charged for the missing/loss of several appliances 
in the warehouse under their watch.
[10]


In response, Lafuente vehemently denied having knowledge of the 
incident. He explained that he had no authority to stay in the warehouse
 and that the dispatching area was more or less 60 meters away from the 
warehouse. As a Dispatching-in-Charge, he only recorded the model and 
serial numbers of the appliances for dispatch and assisted in carrying 
the withdrawn items from the warehouse only in cases of several orders. 
He added that before the withdrawn units were loaded for delivery to the
 branch, the guard on duty would verify and inspect the items.
[11]


In Panaguiton's written explanation,
[12]

 he narrated that he would take over the checking of the units and 
handle the requested items for dispatch only when Lafuente is not 
around. He would also bring the items for loading when no utility 
personnel is present. He recounted that when he discovered some missing 
units in the warehouse, he told his manager about it; the manager, 
however, just instructed him to first find the missing appliances. 
Despite his efforts, he only found empty appliance boxes.

After the conduct of an investigation, DCWI, in two similarly worded 
Memoranda
[13]
 dated October 5,
 2016, found petitioners guilty of Gross and Habitual Neglect by the 
Employee of his Duties, and terminated their employment, portions of 
which are cited herein to wit:


x x x Based on the explanations you have offered in your 
letter reply received September 10, 2016 and during the Investigation 
hearing September 12, 2016, you acknowledged to be the Dispatching 
in-charge for the Household and Appliance department, and that you knew 
about the issue on missing units prior to the disclosure by Sammuel 
Llantada to Head Office staff. You mentioned about the charges incurred 
and reversal of such charges when Mr. Llantada cleared the issue but no 
audit report was submitted for verification and evaluation. During the 
investigation hearing, you admitted to have not implemented monthly 
actual inventory. When you had doubts about the missing units, you 
haven't requested for actual count/audit and were shocked to found [
sic
]
 out of the quantities lost in the area.

After careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances obtaining
 your case, we have determined that your explanation is unacceptable. As
 a dispatcher, it is your main duty and responsibility to see to it that
 your area of jurisdiction is in order. That, all units taken out from, 
the department must have proper documentation whether it be SOLD or for 
TRANSFER units. You w7ere not able to reach the expectation of the 
company as Dispatcher or Releasing in-charge. Your failure to perform 
work due to gross negligence has resulted to the damage and prejudice of
 the company's interest and is in direct violation of the established 
company rules and regulations which warrants the termination of your 
employment.
[14]


Aggrieved, petitioners filed a complaint against DCWCI and Yap for 
illegal dismissal. They raised that the first notice did not show in 
detail their alleged infraction; thus, null and void. They insisted that
 they were not remiss in their duties and functions as dispatchers; that
 they have no knowledge of or participation in the qualified theft 
incident; and that the incident was attributable to the 
bodega-in-charge, the security guard, the appliance manager, Mr. Samuel 
Llantada (Llantada), and Ms. Lovely Viduya. They asserted that it was 
through Lafuente's efforts that the thief, Rambo Menguito Dospueblos 
(Dospueblos), DCWCI's utility man and a cousin of Lafuente, voluntarily 
surrendered to the authorities resulting in the recovery of a few stolen
 television units.
[15]


Respondents countered that petitioners' dismissal was anchored on Article 297 [282](b)
[16]

 of the Labor Code of the Philippines (Labor Code) on gross and habitual
 neglect of duties. They insinuated that petitioners did not use 
reasonable care and caution when 29 television sets were taken out of 
its bodega without proper orders. They argued that, although nine sets 
were recovered, they incurred actual losses amounting to P448,056.00 
which petitioners' long years of service or unblemished record could not
 mitigate.
[17]


Ruling of the LA


In the Decision
[18]
 dated 
January 25, 2017, the LA ruled that petitioners have been illegally 
dismissed from employment; thus, it granted them separation pay in lieu 
of reinstatement, plus 13
th
 month pay and service incentive 
leave pay.

The LA held that the dismissal of petitioners for gross and habitual 
neglect of duties and fraud/willful breach of trust was unjustified. For
 the LA, petitioners' primary duty was simply to ascertain that all the 
requirements for the final release of items sold or transferred to 
DCWCI's sister companies were met. They were not in charge of the 
warehouse security and that the presence of the company encoder and 
bodega-in-charge showed that petitioners were not directly accountable 
for the stocks inside the warehouse.
[19]


The LA added that, assuming petitioners were also tasked to conduct 
inventory of stocks, the extreme penalty of dismissal was incommensurate
 for their failure to do so in light of the concomitant accountabilities
 of DCWCI's company encoder and bodega-in-charge.

Dissatisfied, respondents filed an appeal and asserted that petitioners,
 as dispatchers, were strategically stationed at the entrance and exit 
of the warehouse where every item for disposal could pass through them 
for inspection. For respondents, the entire warehouse was petitioners' 
place of work and their job was to control, verify, and inspect every 
disposal of items while the warehouse was open.


Ruling of the NLRC


In the Decision
[20]
 dated June
 30, 2017, the NLRC granted respondents' appeal and ruled that 
petitioners were validly dismissed from employment for gross and 
habitual neglect of their duties. The NLRC pointed out that although it 
was not shown that petitioners stole the appliances in the warehouse, 
they were nonetheless liable because of their failure to monitor and 
support the day to day operations of the store and properly account for 
all the stocks.

The NLRC denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration in the 
Resolution
[21]
 dated September 27, 2017. Consequently, petitioners filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
[22]

 with the CA praying that the Decision of the NLRC be set aside and the 
ruling of the LA be reinstated with modification as to backwages.


Ruling of the CA


In the assailed Decision,
[23]
 
the CA dismissed the petition for lack of merit and upheld the NLRC. It 
ruled that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion when it vacated
 and set aside the ruling of the LA, explaining as follows:


In the incident that transpired on August 31, 2016, 
twenty-nine (29) television sets went missing during the watch of 
petitioners. As admitted by petitioners themselves, it is their duty to 
check and record the model and serial numbers of all items that are 
released from the bodega in their logbook for bodega purposes. 
Apparently, petitioners failed to exercise due or even ordinary 
diligence to protect the company property as the missing items were 
taken out of the bodega, under their watch, without the proper 
documentation. Had the petitioners discharged their duties, no loss 
would have been incurred. As noted by the NLRC, the twenty nine lost 
items were big ones and could not be easily concealed. They could not 
have passed through the process of inspection by the dispatchers prior 
to their final disposal without being noticed.

Notably, [petitioners'] negligence, although gross, was not habitual. In
 view of the considerable resultant damage, however, the Court finds 
that the cause is sufficient to dismiss them from employment. x x x
[24]


Petitioners filed their Motion for Reconsideration,
[25]
 but the CA denied the motion in the Resolution
[26]
 dated January 23, 2019.

Hence, the instant petition.


The Courts Ruling


The petition lacks merit.

As a general rule, a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule
 45 of the Rules of Court precludes the Court from resolving factual 
issues, However, the instant case presents a situation where there is a 
divergence between the assessment of petitioners' case by the LA, the 
NLRC, and the CA calling for the application of the exception where the 
Court may be urged to resolve factual issues.

The propriety of the dismissal of petitioners from employment is rooted 
on Article 297 [282] of the Labor Code which mandates the concurrence of
 two requisites: (a) the dismissal must be for any of the just causes 
provided for under the Labor Code; and (b) the employee must be afforded
 an opportunity to be heard and defend himself.
[27]

 Otherwise stated, an employer can terminate the services of an employee
 for just and valid causes which must be supported by clear and 
convincing evidence. Further, procedurally, the employee must be given 
notice, with adequate opportunity to be heard before he is notified of 
his actual dismissal for cause.
[28]


The petitioners' preventive
suspension did not amount to
termination of employment.


Petitioners argue that DCWCI immediately terminated their employment 
"under the cloak of preventive suspension on the First Notice"

 dated September 5, 2016 in violation of their right to due process 
envisaged by the twin notice rule under Article 297 [282] of the Labor 
Code.

The pertinent provision regarding preventive suspension is Sections 8 of
 Rule XXIII, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code 
(Omnibus Rules), as amended by Department Order No. 9, Series of 1997, 
viz.:


Section 8. 
Preventive suspension
.â The employer may 
place the worker concerned under preventive suspension if his continued 
employment poses a serious and imminent threat to the life or property 
of the employer or of his co-workers.


Through preventive suspension, an employer safeguards itself from 
further harm or losses that may be further caused by the erring 
employee. This principle was explained by the Court in 
Gatbonton v. NLRC
:
[29]


Preventive suspension is a disciplinary measure for the 
protection of the company's property pending investigation of any 
alleged malfeasance or misfeasance committed by the employee. The 
employer may place the worker concerned under preventive suspension if 
his continued employment poses a serious and imminent threat to the life
 or property of the employer or of his co-workers.
[30]


The concept was applied by the Court in 
Bluer Than Blue Joint Ventures Company, et al. v. Esteban
,
[31]
 where it was ruled:


Preventive suspension is a measure allowed by law and 
afforded to the employer if an employee's continued employment poses a 
serious and imminent threat to the employer's life or property or of his
 co-workers. It may be legally imposed against an employee whose alleged
 violation is the subject of an investigation.


Here, it should be pointed out that petitioners have mistaken their 
preventive suspension as a violation of the twin notice rule. Preventive
 suspension is not the dismissal from employment contemplated under the 
provisions of the Labor Code which would require compliance with the 
twin notice rule. It is merely a disciplinary measure within the ambit 
of the management's exercise of prerogative pending the conduct of 
investigation for an employee's possible infractions. Considering that 
petitioners were performing functions that involved handling of DCWCI's 
properties, respondents had every right to protect their assets and 
operations pending their investigation. It was only prudent for DCWCI to
 preventively suspend them because they were also suspects to the 
stealing incident, and DCWCI had to determine whether they had conspired
 with the culprit, Dospueblos, who coincidentally is Lafiiente's cousin. 

The Court is likewise not convinced that there was a violation of 
petitioners' due process rights. Based from the records, the first 
notice denominated as Notice of Preventive Suspension with Investigation
 Hearing dated September 5, 2016 charged petitioners of 
"Gross and Habitual Neglect by the Employee of His Duties"
 and of 
"Fraud/Willfull Breach by the Employee of the Trust Reposed on Him by His Employer."

 In this notice, petitioners were given a period of five days from 
"notice to explain the several missing or lost appliances in the 
warehouse under their watch which they complied with. Petitioners were 
even afforded the chance to be heard during the company hearing before 
the issuance of the second notice
[32]

 on petitioners' termination from employment. 
DCWCI having acted within its rights in preventively suspending 
petitioners, the Court brushes aside the latter's contention that they 
were immediately terminated from employment under the cloak of a 
preventive suspension notice in violation of their right to due process.


Petitioners were grossly and 
habitually negligent of their 
duties.
 

Petitioners maintain that the CA erred in its conclusion that the 
missing properties were under their watch because they are not directly 
accountable to conduct a monthly inventory of stocks and that there is a
 bodega-in-charge, a duty guard in the warehouse, and an encoder of 
incoming and outgoing stocks. 
The Court is not swayed. In order to warrant the dismissal of the 
employee for just cause, Article 297 [282](b) of the Labor Code requires
 the negligence to be gross and habitual.
[33]

 Gross negligence is defined as the want of even slight care, acting or 
omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not 
inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious 
indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.
[34]

 Habitual neglect connotes repeated failure to perform one's duties for a
 period of time, depending upon the circumstances, which should not be 
limited to a single or isolated act of negligence.
[35]

 However, in several cases, the Court has departed from this 
requirement, like where the employer suffered substantial iosses because
 of the gravity of negligence displayed by the employee.
[36]
 

Undisputedly, petitioners were dispatchers of DCWCI whose primary duties
 were to control, verify, and inspect every disposal of items coming 
from the warehouse. They were stationed in a strategic location where 
every item could pass through them for inspection.
[37]

 As the employees in charge of controlling, verifying, and inspecting 
every disposal of units from the warehouse, the Court cannot subscribe 
to their claim that they were not expected to conduct an inventory of 
the appliances in the warehouse. Had petitioners regularly performed 
their duties as dispatchers, which necessarily included the conduct of 
an inventory, the theft of the television sets could have been averted 
or at least discovered at once while the losses were still minimal. 
Also, the necessary investigation and security measures could have been 
immediately conducted to prevent further pilferage. 
Moreover, what aggravated petitioners' gross and habitual negligence was
 their failure to report the incident after discovering that there were 
already missing stocks in the warehouse. Petitioners themselves admitted
 during the company hearing that they already knew of the missing stocks
 even before the management conducted the surprise inventory and even 
prior to the Spot Report
[38]
 submitted by Llantada on September 3, 2016.
[39]

 As dispatchers tasked to control, verify, and inspect every disposal of
 items from the warehouse, it was incumbent upon them to urgently report
 any irregularity in the warehouse, much more, any loss occurring 
therein. While there is no direct evidence of theft on their part, or 
proof of their conspiracy with Dospueblos, the Court is puzzled as to 
why they never bothered to report the matter so that an investigation 
could be held at once. They may not have been directly involved in the 
pilferage of DC WCI's products, but their negligence and indifference 
facilitated the unauthorized dispatch of products out of DC WCI's 
warehouse. 

The Court quotes with approval the apt disquisition of the NLRC:


We observe though that neither of the parties presented any 
documentary evidence, such as employment contracts, to establish their 
claims relative to the actual nature of Nilo and Billy's daily tasks. 
But what is apparent and substantially proven is that both acted as 
dispatchers and that appellant Davao Central lost several valuable items
 during their watch. It also established that it is the common duty and 
responsibility of the complainants-appellees, as such dispatchers, to 
thoroughly check all items that are dispatched from the bodega. It is 
also established, as it is not disputed that the items were lost during 
their watch. Thus, complainants cannot just make a general denial and 
wash their hands clean, so to speak from any responsibility arising from
 said incident. Had they exercised due care or even ordinary diligence 
in the performance of their duties to protect appellant Davao Central's 
property, no loss would have been incurred. It is immaterial that 
appellees were not among those who actually stole the television sets. 
They may not have been directly involved in the thievery but they are 
nonetheless complicit because they miserably failed to perform their 
dutiesin [
sic
] monitoring and supporting the day to day 
operations of the store and ensuring that all the stocks were properly 
accounted for. The nature of their tasks and the fact of huge loss 
suffered by appellant dictate that they are answerable to the losses 
that their employer incurred.
[40]


An employer has free reign over every aspect of its business, including 
the dismissal of his employees as long as the exercise of its management
 prerogative is done reasonably, in good faith, and in a manner not 
otherwise intended to defeat or circumvent the rights of workers,
[41]

 Under the circumstances of the case, the Court finds no bad faith on 
DCWCI's part in dismissing petitioners in view of the gravity of the 
negligence they committed and the resultant damage and losses DCWCI 
sustained.
