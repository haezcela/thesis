HERNANDO, J.:


For resolution is a 
Petition for Review on Certiorari
[1]

 filed by petitioners Heirs of Leonarda Latoja (Leonarda), namely 
Antonia D. Fabilane (Antonia) and Prudencia F. Bello (Prudencia), 
represented by Petra F. Negado (Petra), which assails the July 22, 2010 
Decision
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01656 which reversed and set aside the May 29, 2006 
Decision
[3]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Calbiga, Samar, Branch 33. 
The RTC found in favor of the Heirs of Leonarda in a case for 
Declaration of Nullity of Title, Reconveyance and Damages
,
 thereby ordering the reconveyance as well as the surrender and 
consequent cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. 20783 (OCT 
20783) in the name of the Heirs of Gavino Latoja (Gavino) represented by
 Friolan Ragay (Friolan).
[4]
 


The Antecedents:
 

This 
petition
 involves from a 4,125.99-square-meter lot (Lot 5366) located in Villareal, Samar.
[5]

 In 1903, the spouses Tomas Dalaruya and Leonarda Latoja allegedly 
possessed, resided, and cultivated Lot 5366. In 1945, Leonarda declared 
said lot for taxation purposes. When the spouses died, their five 
children, namely Anacleto, Dionesio, Balbina, Antonia and Sofronia 
inherited Lot 5366. In 1960, Balbina sold her share to Antonia;
[6]
 Anacleto and Sofronia likewise sold their shares to Antonia a month apart in 1967.
[7]
 
On the other hand, Friolan, a relative and representative of the Heirs 
of Gavino, purportedly occupied and administered Lot 5366 when his aunt 
died.
[8]
 He applied for a free
 patent over said lot through the assistance of Elmer Talbo (Elmer), 
Land Inspector of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office
 (CENRO) of Basey, Samar.
[9]
 
When Friolan approached Elmer in the field, the latter readily received 
and accepted the free patent application on February 8, 1999, absent a 
personal inspection of the lot as he was already leaving for Basey, 
Samar.
[10]
 On the succeeding 
day, Elmer personally posted the Notice of Application in Villareal, 
processed the application in the office, and conducted a Confirmatory 
Report.
[11]
 By virtue of the award of Patente Big. 086021-99-1181 issued on March 12, 1999, a 
Katibayan ng Orihinal na Titulo Blg. 20783
[12]
 (OCT 20783) was subsequently secured and registered in the name of the Heirs of Gavino, as represented by Friolan. 

Distressed upon knowing of this development, the Heirs of Leonarda instituted before the RTC a 
Complaint
[13]
 for 
Declaration of Nullity of Title, Reconveyance and Damages

 contending that they inherited Lot 5366 from their 
predecessors-in-interest who are the real owners and possessors of the 
lot since time immemorial They asserted that the Heirs of Gavino and 
Friolan obtained the free patent and the consequent OCT 20783 through 
fraud and false representation that they were owners and possessors of 
Lot 5366. They also avowed that the posting of notice of the free patent
 application as required under the Public Land Act was not complied 
with. Due to this nonÂ­compliance, the Heirs of Leonarda failed to take 
action against the free patent application.
[14]

In their 
Answer with Counterclaim
,
[15]

 the Heirs of Gavino interposed a general denial of all allegations set 
forth in the complaint, and raised the following special and affirmative
 defenses: that the trial court failed to acquire jurisdiction over the 
person of indispensable heirs; that the Heirs of Leonarda have no legal 
capacity to sue or have a cause of action; that there was an existing 
action involving the same parties and for the same cause; that the 
claims of the Heirs of Leonarda have been waived or extinguished; and 
that a condition 
sine qua non
 before the filing of the complaint was not complied with.
[16]


While the trial court denied most of the defenses raised, it nonetheless
 held that prescription, lack of cause of action and unenforceability 
were to be adjudicated on the merits based on clear and convincing 
evidence.


Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:


In its Decision
[17]
 dated May 29, 2006, the trial court found that OCT 20783 had already become indefeasible when the Complaint for 
Declaration of Nullity of Title, Reconveyance and Damages
 was filed.
[18]

 Nonetheless, it ruled that while an action for reconveyance 
acknowledges the incontrovertible nature of a decree of registration, 
the very essence of reconveyance is to transfer the property that was 
erroneously registered in another's name back to the rightful owner or 
to the one with a better right.
[19]

 Moreover, it held that Lot 5366 has remained in the possession of 
Leonarda and her heirs to the exclusion of other persons as established 
by Petra's testimony, the Land Data Chart which showcased that Lot 5366 
was surveyed for Leonarda, and Antonia's continuous payments of real 
property tax of the land in the name of her mother from 1945 to 1999.
[20]
 

In relation to the allegation of fraud, the trial court held that the 
Heirs of Leonarda sufficiently proved that Friolan committed 
misrepresentation coupled with bad faith in the application for free 
patent. Despite knowing that the Heirs of Leonarda were in actual 
possession of Lot 5366, Friolan represented in the application that 
Gavino occupied said lot since 1920. In addition, Friolan even testified
 he did not reside in Lot 5366 but in the adjacent Lot 5367. The trial 
court did not give credence to Elmer's testimony that he posted a notice
 of application in Villareal in compliance with Section 46 of the Public
 Land Act. The apparent expedited processing of the application and the 
alleged conduct of verification even prior to the filing of application 
rendered the alleged compliance improbable and incredible. Finally, the 
trial court found the evidence proffered by the Heirs of Leonarda 
sufficient to overthrow the presumption of regularity in the performance
 of official duty.


The dispositive portion of the trial court's Decision reads as follows:


PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court finds preponderance of 
evidence leaning heavily towards the plaintiffs and thus hereby rules as
 follows:

1. The cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. 20783 in the 
name of the Heirs of Gavino Latoja represented by Froilan Ragay, issued 
on 29 March 1999, and consequently is hereafter declared null and void. 
Defendant Friolan Ragay [,] his assigns or any representative or any one
 of the heirs of Gavino Latoja is directed to deliver and surrender the 
same to the Register of Deeds of Samar sitting at Catbalogan, Samar;
 2. That the Free Patent No. 086021-99-1181 is awarded to the Heirs of 
Leonarda Latoja instead of the heirs of Gavino Latoja, the former having
 a better right to the land subject of same free patent;

3. That upon reconveyance, delivery and surrender of Original 
Certificate of Title No. 20783 to the Register of Deeds of Samar, the 
latter is to cause the annotation of the Free Patent No. 086021-99-1181 
in the name of the Heirs of Leonarda Latoja and issue and Original 
Certificate of Title in same name;


4. That defendant Froilan Ragay is to pay exemplary damages of 
P30,000.00 and reasonable attorney's fees and litigation expenses of 
P50,000.00 to plaintiffs;

5. That the counterclaims are dismissed; and,

6. Cost of this suit.

SO ORDERED.
[21]


This prompted the Heirs of Gavino to elevate the case on appeal to the CA. They challenged the 
ratio

 of the trial court by mainly arguing that there was compliance with the
 substantial and procedural requirements set forth in the Public Land 
Act; that the Heirs of Leonarda failed to discharge their burden of 
proof, hence, the trial court's Decision was anchored on the deficiency 
and frailty of the defense's evidence. 


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
 

The appellate court found the appeal of the Heirs of Gavino meritorious in its 
Decision
[22]

 dated July 22, 2010. It held that the trial court erred when it 
disregarded the indefeasibility of title. Based on the appellate court's
 findings, the assertion of fraud was unsubstantiated in evidence. It 
stressed that the law contemplates extrinsic fraud as a ground to reopen
 a decree of registration.
[23]

 However, there was no showing that the Heirs of Gavino employed actual 
and extrinsic fraud in applying for the free patent and the resulting 
certificate of title.
[24]
 
Moreover, the Heirs of Leonarda did not timely assert their claim since 
the posting of the notice of application was properly complied with. 
Lastly, the appellate court emphasized that a certificate of title 
obtained under the Torrens System cannot be defeated by a mere claim of 
ownership since the proceedings in securing a title is directed against 
all persons which include those who have interest on the land. It 
decreed in this wise:


WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated
 May 29, 2006 of the Regional Trial Court of Calbiga, Samar, in Civil 
Case No. C-2001-1030, is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE.

SO ORDERED.
[25]


Aggrieved, petitioners filed a 
Motion for Reconsideration
[26]
 which the Court of Appeals likewise denied in a 
Resolution
[27]
 dated January 12, 2011. Undeterred, petitioners filed the instant 
Petition for Review on Certiorari
[28]
raising the following issues, to wit:


(1)


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED AND GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT 
[DECLARED] THAT THE PATENTE BLG. 086021-99-1181 WITH THE CORRESPONDING 
KATIBAYAN NG ORIHINAL NA TITULO BLG. 20783 ARE ALREADY INDEFEASIBLE, 
IRREVOCABLE AND INDISPUTABLE BECAUSE MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR HAD ALREADY 
ELAPSED SINCE THE DATE OF THEIR ISSUANCE, THUS REVERSING AND SETTING 
AIDE THE DECISION OF THE LOWER COURT.


(2)


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED [IN HOLDING] THAT THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD BY THE PETITIONERS ARE MORE IMAGINARY THAN REAL.
[29]


In their 
Petition
[30]
 and 
Compliance with Reply
,
[31]

 the Leonarda heirs maintain that notwithstanding the fact that OCT 
20783 had already attained finality and had become indefeasible; their 
action for reconveyance is one exception where such title may be 
directly attacked since Lot 5366 was erroneously registered in the name 
of another who is not the rightful owner.
[32]
They
 further aver that even if Section 91 of the Public Land Act does not 
specifically mention extrinsic fraud, this provision nonetheless 
contemplates false statements or omission of facts made by the applicant
 in the application for free patent that would 
ipso facto
 produce the cancellation of title or permit.
[33]

 Even more striking are the badges of fraud such as the issuance of OCT 
20783 prior to the actual survey of Lot 5366, and the conduct of the 
interview a month prior to the filing of the application for free 
patent.
[34]
 The Heirs of 
Leonarda insist that the appellate court failed to recognize these 
irregularities in the award of free patent and the consequent issuance 
of OCT 20783, which were substantially supported in evidence. 
On the other hand, the Heirs of Gavino assert in their 
Comment
[35]
 and 
Rejoinder
[36]

 that the purpose of the Torrens System is to put an end and to finally 
settle any question regarding the legality of the title. They 
persistently claim that the corresponding notice of application was in 
fact posted by Elmer, without contrary proof adduced by the Heirs of 
Leonarda. Hence, Elmer must be presumed to have regularly performed his 
duties absent any rebuttal from the Heirs of Leonarda. They also cite 
Section 101 of the Public Land Act to support their supplication that 
all actions for reversion of lands of public domain must be instituted 
by the Solicitor General or the officers acting in his stead, and not 
private persons such as the Heirs of Leonarda.

The two-pronged issue before Us: 
first
, whether or not the title 
arising from the award of free patent has become indefeasible so as to 
foreclose the action for reconveyance; and 
second
, whether or not the Heirs of Gavino employed fraud paving the way for the reconveyance in favor of the Heirs of Leonarda.


Our Ruling


The 
petition
 is meritorious. 

In a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the 
Revised Rules of Court
,
 only questions of law may be raised and entertained as a rule 
considering that this Court is not a trier of facts, and questions of 
fact are left to the wisdom and determination of the trial courts.
[37]
 Ascertaining whether or not fraud was employed in an application for free patent is a question of fact.
[38]
This
 Court generally adheres to the factual findings of the trial court and 
the appellate court especially when these tribunals have similar 
findings. However, as an exception to the rule, this Court may 
re-examine evidence and rule on a question of fact when the findings of 
fact are conflicting or when the findings of the appellate court are 
contraiy to those of the trial court, among other grounds.
[39]

 In the case at bench, We are presented with incongruent assessments of 
the trial court and of the appellate court with regard to the 
surrounding circumstances anent Friolan's application for free patent 
over Lot 5366, and the subsequent registration thereof under the Torrens
 System. With this conflict at hand, We are constrained to review the 
records and the evidence of this case 
vis-a-vis
 the legal question for resolution.


Despite the title's indefeasibility, an action 
for reconveyance may still prosper.


The principle of indefeasibility of a Torrens title has been carved in 
case law edicts. This means that a certificate of title registered under
 the Torrens System serves as proof of an incontrovertible title over 
the property in favor of the individual whose name appears on the title.
[40]

 With the emergence of the Torrens System, the integrity and 
conclusiveness of a certificate of title may be guaranteed and 
preserved. However, this system frowns upon those who fraudulently 
secure a certificate of title to the prejudice of the real owner of the 
land. Hence, usurpers who intend to enrich themselves cannot hide under 
the mantle of the Torrens System
[41]

 which may only be cancelled, altered or modified through a direct 
attack where the objective of the action is to annul or set aside the 
judgment or enjoin its enforcement
[42]
 
An action for reconveyance based on fraud is a direct attack on a Torrens title.
[43]

 It follows that despite the finality accorded to a Torrens title, 
reconveyance may prosper as an equitable remedy given to the rightful 
owner of a land that was erroneously registered in the name of another. 
This action recognizes the validity of the registration and its 
incontrovertible nature; it does not question the indefeasibility of the
 Torrens title.
[44]


In 
Heirs of Loyola v. Court of Appeals
,
[45]
 this Court expounded on the quantum of proof that is required in an action for reconveyance on the ground of fraud, 
viz
.:


Fraud and irregularity are presupposed in an action for reconveyance of property. 
The
 party seeking to recover the property must prove, by clear and 
convincing evidence, that he or she is entitled to the property, and 
that the adverse party has committed fraud in obtaining his or her 
title.
 Allegations of fraud are not enough. Intentional acts to 
deceive and deprive another of his right, or in some manner injure him, 
must be specifically alleged and proved. In the absence of any proof, 
the complaint for reconveyance cannot be granted.
[46]
 (Emphasis supplied)


From the foregoing disquisition, an allegation of fraud in an action for reconveyance must have two requisites. 
First
, that the individual seeking reconveyance must prove entitlement or ownership over the property in question, and 
second
,
 that fraud must be established by clear and convincing evidence, not 
just based on mere surmises or conjectures. 
At this juncture, We note that OCT 20783 had already attained finality 
when the complaint was lodged against the Heirs of Gavino. However, the 
indefeasibility of OCT 20783 as a Torrens title does not bar an action 
for reconveyance involving land covered thereof In fact, an action for 
reconveyance is impresciptible when the plaintiff, Heirs of Leonarda in 
this case, is in possession of the land subject of reconveyance,
[47]
 and provided that the land in issue has not yet passed to an innocent purchaser for value. This Court enunciated the 
ratio
 for this stance in 
Campos v. Ortega, Sr.
,
[48]
 to wit:


In
 Alfredo v. Borras
, the Court ruled that 
prescription does not run against the plaintiff in actual possession of 
the disputed land because such plaintiff has a right to wait until his 
possession is disturbed or his title is questioned before initiating an 
action to vindicate his right. 
His undisturbed possession gives him 
the continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to determine 
the nature of the adverse claim of a third party and its effect on his 
title.
 The Court held that where the plaintiff in an action for 
reconveyance remains in possession of the subject land, the action for 
reconveyance becomes in effect an action to quiet title to property, 
which is not subject to prescription.
[49]
 (Emphasis Supplied)


Thus, despite the lapse of one year from the issuance of OCT 20783, the 
action for reconveyance is still an appropriate and available remedy for
 the Leonarda heirs. Here, they have also sufficiently complied with the
 two requisites for an action for reconveyance based on fraud. 
Anent the first requisite, the Heirs of Leonarda's evidence on record 
established that Leonarda was the lawful owner and possessor of Lot 5366
 since time immemorial. Upon her demise, said lot was inherited by her 
five children including Antonia who was adjudged to be the rightful 
possessor of the 4/5 portion of Lot 5366 on the strength of a decision 
rendered by the MCTC of Villareal-Pinabacdao, Samar dated August 29, 
1994.
[50]
 To reinforce their 
assertion, the following were also submitted by the Heirs of Leonarda: 
(a) the Sketch of Lot 5366 in the name of Leonarda issued by the 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in Tacloban City;
[51]
 (b) a 
Resolution
[52]

 dated March 3, 2002 from the Office of the Sangguniang Barangay of 
Pang-Pang, Villareal recognizing the ownership of Lot 5366 in the name 
of Leonarda;
[53]
 (c) a Tax Declaration No. 15199 in the name of Leonarda;
[54]
 and (d) a Tax Clearance Certificate dated April 30, 1999 issued by the Office of the Municipal Treasurer of Villareal, Samar.
[55]

 In addition, Friolan himself admitted in his testimony that Petra was 
one of the actual occupants of Lot 5366, while he occupied the adjacent 
Lot 5367.
[56]
 These bespeak of
 the Heirs of Leonarda's rightful possession, interest and entitlement 
to Lot 5366, making the first requisite present.


In relation to the second requisite, fraud had been sufficiently proven 
by the heirs of Leonarda. While the findings of the trial court and the 
appellate court with regard to the presence or absence of fraud are 
contrary to each other, We settle that the allegation of fraud is real 
and evident on the records. Jurisprudence articulates what constitutes 
fraud. It is characterized by an intentional omission of facts as 
required by law to be truthfully and correctly stated in the application
 for free patent or a statement of claim contrary to the truth.
[57]

 It is hornbook doctrine that the party alleging fraud has the burden of
 proof, and has to meet the quantum of proof which is clear and 
convincing evidence that is less than proof beyond reasonable doubt but 
greater than preponderance of evidence.
[58]

 Furthermore, Section 91 of the Public Land Act is specific to the 
effect that omission of facts or false statements on the material facts 
set forth in the application for patent shall 
ipso facto
 produce the cancellation of the concession, title, or permit.
[59]


Perusing the records, it is once apparent that Friolan made false 
statements in his application for free patent notwithstanding his 
knowledge and awareness that the Heirs of Leonarda were the actual 
occupants of Lot 5366 at the time when he applied for free patent. In 
his testimony, Friolan mentioned such fact, to wit:


[ATTY. MORENO]: Tell to the Honorable Court, that you are 
residing at the Brgy. Pangpang, Villareal, Samar, you applied for a 
pre-patent [free patent] of a certain parcel of land you described as 
Lot No. 5366, you are staying within this Lot No. 5366?
 [ANSWER]: No, sir.


Q: Who is occupying actually this Lot No. 5366?

A: This Petra Nicado [Negado], sir.


Q: The plaintiff in this case?
A: Yes, sir.

Q: I am correct to say, that you are residing [in] an adjacent lot which
 is Lot No. 5367?

A: No, is different.
 Q: Do you know what lot number you are occupying at this present?

A: Yes, sir, I know.

Q: Please tell to the Honorable Court?
A: In Lot No. 5367, sir.

x 
x x x
[60]


To fortify that misrepresentation and fraud attended the application for
 free patent, the Heirs of Leonarda presented in evidence the 
Application for Free Patent
[61]
 which was accomplished by Elmer when he interviewed Friolan.
[62]

 It will be observed that Friolan indicated Lot 5366 as the land subject
 for the free patent and represented that Gavino first entered and 
cultivated such lot since 1920. Glaringly, he further claimed that no 
other individuals were occupying said lot, 
viz
.:


4. The land described and applied for is not claimed or 
occupied by any other person but is public land. I entered upon and 
begun cultivation on the same on 1936 and since that date I have 
continuously cultivated the land and have made thereon the following 
improvements: cocos.
[63]


The contradictory and inconsistent statements in his testimony with the claim in the application, declaration in the 
Land Data Record Sheet
[64]
 and 
Affidavit
[65]

 that he is the actual occupant and possessor of Lot 5366 bolster his 
penchant for twisting the truth constituting fraud in order to secure a 
free patent that eventually led to the issuance of OCT 20783. To repeat,
 Friolan was fully aware that the Heirs of Leonarda were the actual 
occupants of Lot 5366; but he nonetheless applied for a free patent over
 said lot. 

We also affirm the trial court's findings of the attendance of badges of
 fraud in the issuance of OCT 20783 and in the application for free 
patent. First, Elmer testified that he personally posted a 
Notice of Application
[66]
 in Villareal the next day after the application for free patent was received.
[67]
 The allegation of compliance with the posting of a notice of application was controverted by a 
Certification
[68]

 of Teofilo Obregon, Barangay Captain of Barangay Pang-pang, Villareal, 
Samar. Said certification attests that there was no posting of Friolan's
 free patent application for Lot 5366 in the barangay premises for the 
month of March and April 1999. Even 
granting arguendo
 that a 
notice was posted, such notice indicated that any adverse claim should 
be filed on or before March 23, 1999. However, OCT 20783 was already 
issued in the name of the Heirs of Gavino as early as March 12, 1999.
[69]
 The expeditious processing of said OCT casts doubt on the proper compliance with the requirements as provided by law. 
In light of these documents and testimonies, it is evident that 
Patente Blg. 086021-99-118

 was secured though misrepresentation and fraud, and the consequent 
issuance of OCT 20783 was marked with undue haste in the name of the 
Heirs of Gavino as represented by Friolan. Tersely, the two requisites 
of an action for reconveyance were complied with, and the Heirs of 
Leonarda discharged their burden of proving through clear and convincing
 evidence that misrepresentation and fraud attended the application and 
processing of the free patent in favor of the Heirs of Gavino. 
Ergo
, the appellate court's reversal of the trial court's decision was unwarranted.


Private individuals, aside from the Office 
of the Solicitor General, may seek direct 
reconveyance of a land subject of a free 
patent where the latter was fraudulently 
obtained.


The Heirs of Gavino invoke Section 101 of the Public Land Act in their 
attempt to finally defeat the action for reconveyance. Said provision 
states that all actions for reversion to the government of lands of 
public domain shall be instituted by the Solicitor General or an officer
 in his stead. Similarly, in 
Spouses Galang v. Spouses Reyes
,
[70]

 the spouses Galang averred that the authority to institute an action to
 annul the title of a former public land which was titled by virtue of a
 free patent issued by the DENR is vested with the Solicitor General. 
This Court disproved said supplication, in this wise:


In this regard, the Galangs are mistaken. The action filed 
by the Reyeses seeks the transfer to their names of the title registered
 in the names of the Galangs. In their Complaint, they alleged that: 
first, they are the owners of the land, being the owners of the 
properties through which the Marigman creek passed when it changed its 
course; and second, the Galangs illegally dispossessed them by having 
the same property registered in their names. 
It was not an action for reversion which requires that the State be the one to initiate the action in order for it to prosper.
 The distinction between the two actions was elucidated in the case of 
Heirs of Kionisala v. Heirs of Dacut
 where it was written:


An ordinary civil action for declaration of nullity of free 
patents and certificates of title is not the same as an action for 
reversion. The difference between them lies in the allegations as to the
 character of ownership of the realty whose title is sought to be 
nullified. In an action for reversion, the pertinent allegations in the 
complaint would admit State ownership of the disputed land. Hence in 
Gabila v. Barriga

 where the plaintiff in his complaint admits that he has no right to 
demand the cancellation or amendment of the defendant's title because 
even if the title were cancelled or amended the ownership of the land 
embraced therein or of the portion affected by the amendment would 
revert to the public domain, we ruled that the action was for reversion 
and that the only person or entity entitled to relief would be the 
Director of Lands.

On the other hand, 
a cause of action for declaration of nullity of 
free patent and certificate of title would require allegations of the 
plaintiffs ownership of the contested lot prior to the issuance of such 
free patent and certificate of title as well as the defendant's fraud or
 mistake;
 as the case may be, in successfully obtaining these 
documents of title over the parcel of land claimed by plaintiff. In such
 a case, the nullity arises strictly not from the fraud or deceit but 
from the fact that the land is beyond the jurisdiction of the Bureau of 
Lands to bestow and whatever patent or certificate of title obtained 
therefor is consequently void 
ab initio
. The real party in 
interest is not the State but the plaintiff who alleges a pre-existing 
right of ownership over the parcel of land in question even before the 
grant of title to the defendant. x x x.
[71]
 (Emphases Supplied)


Likewise in 
Hortizuela v. Tagufa
,
[72]

 this Court expounded on Section 101 of the Public Land Act which admits
 of an exception when a private individual may institute an action for 
reconveyance, 
viz
.:


A recognized exception is that situation where 
plaintiff-claimant seeks direct reconveyance from defendant of public 
land unlawfully and in breach of trust titled by him, on the principle 
of enforcement of a constructive trust. This was the ruling in 
Larzano v. Tabayag, Jr.
, where it was written:


A private individual may bring an action for reconveyance of
 a parcel of land even if the title thereof was issued through a free 
patent since such action does not aim or purport to re-open the 
registration proceeding and set aside the decree of registration, but 
only to show that the person who secured the registration of the 
questioned property is not the real owner thereof.

In 
Roco, et al v. Gimeda
, we stated that if a patent had already 
been issued through fraud or mistake and has been registered, the remedy
 of a party who has been injured by the fraudulent registration is an 
action for reconveyance, x x x:
[73]


Contrary to the assertion of the Heirs of Gavino, the foregoing 
discourse clarified that the Heirs of Leonarda, as private individuals, 
are allowed to institute an action for reconveyance of Lot 5366 
considering the fraudulent scheme employed by the Heirs of Gavino, 
represented by Friolan, in securing the free patent which resulted into 
the registration of OCT 20783 under the latter's names. Considering that
 the Heirs of Leonarda alleged in their complaint that they are the 
rightful owners and possessors of Lot 5366 and that they were deprived 
of the same through the misrepresentation of Friolan in the application 
for free patent, then they have initiated the proper remedy which is an 
action for reconveyance. 
All told, a land titled by virtue of a fraudulent and defective free 
patent, disregarding the provisions of the Public Land Act, may be 
reconveyed to the rightful owner by an action for reconveyance 
instituted by the latter. Since the Heirs of Leonarda, as actual 
possessors of Lot 5366, satisfactorily proved by clear and convincing 
evidence that there was misrepresentation and fraud to their prejudice, 
the action for reconveyance was correctly adjudicated by the trial court
 in their favor.
