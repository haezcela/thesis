LOPEZ, J., J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking to set aside the Decision
[2]
 dated December 20, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated April 2, 2019 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-18-A/R-0003 and 
SB-18-A/R-0004, which dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner and 
upheld the Joint Decision
[4]
 of the Regional Trial Court (
RTC
)
 of Quezon City, Branch 85 in Case Nos. R-QZN-13-01427 and R-QZN-13- 
01428 finding the petitioner guilty of violating Article 315(2)(a) of 
the Revised Penal Code and Section 3(e) of Republic Act (
R.A.
) No. 3019, or the 
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
.
 
Antecedents


 Sometime in February 2010, private complainant Lory D. Malibiran (
Malibiran
) consulted the wife of his best friend, herein petitioner Maybel Umpa (
Umpa
),
 on how he can obtain the approved plan, tax declaration, and the 
Certificate of Title on Fernando Mamaril's 7.2 hectare property located 
in Rodriguez, Rizal. Malibiran, who is incidentally also the godfather 
to eldest daughter, consulted her because he knew that she was working 
with the Land Registration Authority (
LRA
).
[5]

 In response, Umpa assured Malibiran that she can produce the documents.
 She asked for a sketch plan and the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos 
(P20,000.00) as research fee from Malibiran. Thereafter, Umpa introduced
 Malibiran to Carlito Castillo (
Castillo
), who was also working 
at the LRA as an accounting clerk. They discussed the request of 
Malibiran regarding the property of Fernando Mamaril.
[6]

 In the first week of October 2010, Umpa informed Malibiran that the 
latter needed to pay an additional sum of Six Hundred Twenty Thousand 
Pesos (P620,000.00) to facilitate the release of the documents that were
 needed to obtain a certificate of title over Fernando Mamaril's 
property. Eventually, Malibiran was able to raise the amount and gave it
 to Umpa. Unfortunately, Umpa failed to deliver any document. This 
prompted Malibiran to file a complaint against Umpa and Castillo before 
the LRA.
[7]
 
 During the
 scheduled hearing on June 15, 2011, Umpa and Castillo agreed to return 
the sums of money that were given to them by Malibiran before the 
hearing officer, Joel Bigornia (
Bigornia
), Division Chief of the 
LRA's Docket Division. Then again, it was only Castillo, who appeared in
 the next appointed hearing. Hence, the hearing officer recommended the 
filing of appropriate charges against Umpa, which was approved by the 
LRA Administrator.
[8]
 
At any rate, Malibiran decided to withdraw his complaint with the LRA. 
Instead, he filed another complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman 
charging Umpa and Castillo of the following crimes: a) Fraud and Illegal
 Exaction defined and penalized under Article 213, Section 2(c) of the 
Revised Penal Code (
RPC
); b) Other Frauds under Article 214 of the RPC; c) 
estafa
 under Article 315(1) of the RPC; and d) Violation of R.A. No. 3019, as amended.
[9]


 After Umpa and Castillo had filed their Counter-Affidavits,
[10]

 the Office of the Ombudsman issued a Resolution dated March 23, 2012 
finding probable cause to indict them for the crimes of estafa 
under Article 315(2)(a) of the RPC

 and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. Accordingly, two (2) 
Informations were filed against Umpa and Castillo before the (RTC) of 
Quezon City on March 23, 2012. The cases were docketed as R-QZN-A/R-0003
 and R-QZN-A/R-0004 and raffled off to Branch 85.
[11]


 On August 29, 2013, Castillo was arraigned. Later on November 20, 2014, Malibiran executed an Affidavit of Desistance
[12]
 in favor of Castillo. Consequently, the RTC issued an Order
[13]

 on December 2, 2014 dismissing the case against Castillo. On the other 
hand, the case with respect to Umpa was archived as she remained 
at-large. Umpa later resurfaced and was only arraigned on August 11, 
2015.
[14]
 
Ruling of the RTC


 On November 10, 2017, the RTC rendered a Joint Decision finding Umpa to be guilty beyond reasonable doubt of committing 
estafa

 as defined and penalized under Article 315(2)(a) of the RPC and for 
violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. The RTC found that Umpa 
employed fraudulent representations prior to or at least simultaneously 
with Malibiran's delivery of the sum of Six Hundred Twenty Thousand 
Pesos (P620,000.00).
[15]

 Specifically, the RTC took note of the fact that Malibiran gave Umpa 
the sum of money as the latter enticed and promised the former that she 
could have Fernando Mamaril's land titled and be declared for tax 
purposes. Umpa's position in the LRA created in her favor an impression 
of authority to transact with Malibiran, involving financial concerns. 
Despite receipt of the money, Umpa failed to secure and deliver to 
Malibiran the title to the property. Evidently, Umpa capitalized on her 
official functions with the LRA to commit the crimes charged.
[16]
 
 The RTC did not give credence to Umpa's claim that she is innocent of the charges imputed against her. 
First
,
 Umpa admitted that Malibiran consulted her with regard to the titling 
of Fernando Mamaril's property and that she received from him the amount
 of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) in payment for the research fees.
 
Second
, she affirmed that she consulted Castillo because she 
allegedly heard that he knew about the process involved despite the fact
 that he was not authorized to do so. 
Third
, Umpa claimed that 
she turned over to Castillo the sum of Six Hundred Twenty Thousand Pesos
 (P620,000.00) that she received from Malibiran. Umpa, however, failed 
to prove the same.
[17]
 Thus, the RTC disposed as follows:
  


 WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing disquisition, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: 


 1. In Criminal Case No. R-QZN-13-01427, accused MAYBEL A. UMPA is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
Estafa

 defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised 
Penal Code and sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of 
imprisonment of four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision coreccional
, as minimum[,] to ten (10) years of 
prision mayor
, as maximum; 


 2. In Criminal Case No. R-QZN-13-01428, accused MAYBEL A. UMPA 
is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 3(e) of 
R.A. No. 3019 and is hereby SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of 
imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month to eight (8) years; and


 3. Accused MAYBEL A. UMPA is ordered to pay private complainant Lory Malibiran the amount of P620,000.00 as actual damages. 


 
SO ORDERED.
[18]




 Aggrieved, Umpa filed an appeal with the Sandiganbayan, which 
rendered its Decision dated December 20, 2018, affirming the ruling of 
the RTC, but modified the penalty imposed. The Sandiganbayan held that 
all the elements of estafa, as defined and penalized under Article 
315(2)(a) of the RPC, and all the elements for violations of Section 
3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 were proven beyond reasonable doubt.
[19]

 Particularly, Umpa agreed and assured Malibiran that she can facilitate
 the issuance of the approved plan, tax declaration and certificate of 
title. Relying on Umpa's false pretenses and fraudulent acts, Malibiran 
paid her the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) for the 
research fees. Upon Umpa's promise to deliver the subject documents 
within a week, Malibiran paid her the sum of Six Hundred Twenty Thousand
 Pesos (P620,000.00). Umpa, however, is neither authorized nor 
capacitated to facilitate the issuance of the approved plan, tax 
declaration and certificate of title.
[20]

 As regards the alleged contradictory statements of the private 
complainant in the complaint-affidavit and the affidavit of desistance, 
the Sandiganbayan held that these are more imagined than real insofar as
 the culpability of the petitioner is concerned. The said contradictory 
statements pertain to the participation of Castillo in inducing 
Malibiran to produce the money that the petitioner demanded.
[21]
 
 With regard to the penalty imposed, the RTC relied on our ruling in the case of 
Sy vs People
.
[22]

 During the pendency of the instant case, R.A. No. 1095 was passed into 
law, which amended, among others, the penalty imposed for
 estafa 
under
 Article 315 of the RPC. Seeing as the said law is more beneficial to 
Umpa, the same was given retroactive effect in her favor. Thus, the 
Sandiganbayan disposed as follows: 
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the questioned Joint Decision 
dated November 10, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 85, Quezon 
City, is hereby AFFIRMED subject to the modifications that the penalty 
to be imposed in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-13-01427 for the crime of 
estafa 
should be an imprisonment of two (2) months and one (1) day of
 arresto mayor
, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of 
prison correccional
 minimum, as maximum; while the actual damages is a total of P640,000.00


 SO ORDERED.
[23]




 Undeterred, Umpa filed a motion before the Sandiganbayan, asking 
for a reconsideration of its Decision. She insisted that the 
inconsistency between the complaint-affidavit and affidavit of 
desistance marred the credibility of Malibiran as witness. The 
Sandiganbayan, however, reiterated its ruling that the said 
inconsistency is not material. As such, the Sandiganbayan dismissed her 
motion in its Resolution
[24]
 dated April 2, 2019. 
 Left without recourse, Umpa filed a Petition for Review on
 Certiorari

 under Rule 45. She maintains that the Sandiganbayan gravely erred in 
affirming the Joint Decision of the RTC, which found her guilty of the 
crime of 
Estafa
 under paragraph 2(a) of Article 315 of the RPC 
and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, despite the doubtful 
credibility of Malibiran.
[25]


 Umpa asseverates that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of the crime of 
Estafa

 under paragraph 2(a) of Article 315 of the RPC and violation of Section
 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. She points out that the RTC and the 
Sandiganbayan both relied on the testimony of Malibiran. The matters 
that he alleged in his Complaint Affidavit, however, is inconsistent 
with the matters he stated in his Affidavit of Desistance. That is, 
Malibiran did not distinguish their participation in defrauding him. 
While in his Affidavit of Desistance, Malibiran retracted his statement 
and claimed that Castillo took no part in the fraudulent scheme. Such 
manifest inconsistency tends to erode his credibility and raise doubt on
 the veracity of the prosecution evidence.
[26]
 

 For the State, the Office of the Special Prosecutor counters that the 
instant petition before Us should be dismissed for utter lack of merit.
[27]

 Contrary to petitioner's supposition, the purported inconsistencies in 
Malibiran's testimony did not affect the facts proving the criminal 
charges against her as these pertained only to Castillo's participation 
in the commission of the crimes charged. Besides, Malibiran's testimony 
is consistent with those of the other prosecution witnesses and the 
admissions made by the petitioner.
[28]
 
 
The Ruling of the Court


 Petitioner filed a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Settled is the rule that the right 
to appeal is not a natural right but a mere statutory privilege. Hence, 
such right may be exercised only in the manner prescribed by, and in 
accordance with, the provisions of law.
[29]

 Accordingly, for her petition to prosper, Section 5(2) of Rule 45 of 
the Rules of Court provides that the questions raised in her petition 
should be of such substance as to warrant consideration. Under Section 6
 of the same Rules, this Court would only act on her petition if the 
court 
a quo
 has â
  


 (a) decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined 
by the Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord 
with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court; or
 
    (b) so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial 
proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court, as to
 call for an exercise of the power of supervision. 




 From the foregoing, this Court would only entertain Petitions for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 if â
  


 (1) there is a novel legal question involved; 

    (2) the case presents a doctrinal or pedagogical value that is timely for this court to review and expound on; 

    (3) there is need to rectify, modify and/or clarify existing legal policy; or
 
    (4) the petition lays out novel principles that delve into unexplored areas of law.
[30]
 




 In the instant case, this Court finds no substantial matter that 
would warrant the reversal of the Sandiganbayan's disposition. 
Petitioner merely adopted the arguments that she raised before the 
Sandiganbayan to her appeal before Us. These arguments, however, have 
already been squarely discussed and exhaustively passed upon by the 
Sandiganbayan in its Decision dated Decision 20, 2018. The ruling of the
 courts 
a quo
 is in accordance with law and recent jurisprudence. 
 From the records of this case, petitioner was charged for committing 
estafa
 as defined and penalized under Article 315(2) of the RPC. Jurisprudence has enumerated the essential elements for 
estafa
 as defined and penalized under Article 315(2) of the RPC, to be as follows: 
  


 (a) that there must be a false pretense or fraudulent 
representation as to the offender's power, influence, qualifications, 
property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; (b) that 
such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed 
prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (c) that 
the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or 
fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and
 (d) that, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.
[31]




 We find that the courts a quo did not err in ruling that the petitioner is guilty of committing 
estafa
 as defined and penalized under Article 315(2) of the RPC. 
First
,
 she took advantage of Malibiran's misunderstanding that she had the 
authority and the capacity to facilitate the issuance of the approved 
plan, tax declaration, and the certificate of title on Fernando 
Mamaril's land when she had neither. Petitioner claimed in her petition 
that she referred Malibiran to Castillo, whom she knew could have the 
said property titled. Then again, Castillo was only an accounting clerk 
and also had no authority to process the documents requested by 
Malibiran. 
Second
, petitioner committed the fraudulent representation prior to or simultaneous with the commission of fraud. 
Third
,
 relying on petitioner's representations, Malibiran paid petitioner the 
total amount of Six Hundred Forty Thousand Pesos (P640,000.00). 
Fourth
,
 petitioner failed to deliver the documents requested by Malibiran. 
Neither did she return the amount that he paid. Consequently, Malibiran 
suffered actual damages in the total amount of Six Hundred Forty 
Thousand Pesos (P640,000.00). 
 Petitioner was also charged for 
violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. Jurisprudence has provided that
 an accused may only be convicted on such charge if the following 
elements were proven by the prosecution by proof beyond reasonable 
doubt: 
  


 1. The accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions; 

    2. He must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or [gross] inexcusable negligence; and

 
    3. That ills action caused any undue injury to any party, including 
the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, 
advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.
[32]
 




 This Court explained in the case of 
Sison v. People of the Philippines
[33]
 what the second element means as follows: 
  


 "Partiality" is synonymous with "bias" which "excites a 
disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than
 as they are." 
"Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or 
negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and 
conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive 
or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud."
 "Gross 
negligence has been so defined as negligence characterized by the want 
of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where 
there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and 
intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as
 other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care which 
even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their own 
property." 
(Emphasis supplied)
 




 We concur with the ruling of the courts 
a quo
 that all the elements of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, were proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt: 
(a)
 petitioner was then working as Records Officer I for the Land Registration Authority at the time of the commission;
 (b)

 petitioner made it appear to Malibiran that she had the authority and 
the capacity to facilitate the issuance of the approved plan, tax 
declaration, and the certificate of title on Fernando Mamaril's land 
when she had neither; 
(c) 
petitioner asked Malibiran to pay her 
the total amount of Six Hundred Forty Thousand Pesos (P640,000.00) when 
she knew that she could not deliver on her representation to Malibiran; 
and
 (d) 
relying on petitioner's misrepresentations Malibiran 
handed over to the petitioner the total amount of Six Hundred Forty 
Thousand Pesos (P640,000.00), to his undue injury. 
 Petitioner 
seeks to be absolved of all the charges just like her co-accused 
Castillo. Malibiran, however, executed an Affidavit of Desistance before
 he testified before the RTC. He explicitly stated in his affidavit that
 he is no longer interested in prosecuting the case against Castillo. 

 Generally, courts view recantations or affidavits of desistance, if 
executed after conviction of the accused, with suspicion and reservation
 because these can easily be secured from poor and ignorant witnesses 
usually through intimidation or for monetary consideration.
[34]

 Here, Malibiran's affidavit does not partake of a recantation, as he 
has yet to testify in court. All the same, Malibiran's unequivocal 
declaration that he will no longer testify against Castillo precluded 
the prosecution from effectively obtaining the required evidence to 
sustain his conviction. On that account, the RTC dismissed the criminal 
case against Castillo. 
 Petitioner seeks to discredit the 
testimony of Malibiran by arguing that there is an inconsistency between
 his Complaint-Affidavit and his Affidavit of Desistance. She points out
 that in the Complaint-Affidavit, Malibiran did not distinguish their 
individual participation in defrauding him. He treated their action as 
one, except in that instance when Castillo forced Malibiran to mortgage 
his van. On the other hand, in the Affidavit of Desistance, Malibiran 
retracted his previous statement and absolved Castillo of any 
wrongdoing. Petitioner posits that such material inconsistency casts 
aspersions on the credibility of Malibiran as witness.
[35]

 Accordingly, the prosecution's case crumbled, considering that they 
heavily relied on the testimony of Malibiran. Petitioner's contention 
fails to hold water. 
 Settled is the rule that testimonies given in open court are given greater weight than sworn statements taken
 ex parte
 because the latter are invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate.
[36]
 Nevertheless, this Court concurs with the courts 
a quo

 that there is no inconsistency between the two affidavits that were 
executed by Lory Malibiran. The difference between the two affidavits, 
if any, pertains solely to Castillo's participation in the alleged 
fraud. Malibiran was unwavering in his allegations against the 
petitioner, which is also consistent with the testimonies of the other 
prosecution witnesses and petitioner's admissions. The fact remains that
 petitioner took advantage of Malibiran's false impression that she had 
the authority to process his requested documents. There was no showing 
that she even tried to correct him. Instead, petitioner asked Malibiran 
to pay her the total sum of Six Hundred Forty Thousand Pesos 
(P640,000.00) by giving false assurances that she would deliver the 
requested documents. 
 As to the penalty imposed, this Court finds
 that the same should be modified. Section 9 of R.A. No. 3019 imposes 
the following penalties for those found guilty of violating Section 3(e)
 of the said statute: 
  


 
Section 9.
 
Penalties for violations
. (a) Any 
public officer or private person committing any of the unlawful acts or 
omissions enumerated in Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Act shall be 
punished with 
imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than 
ten years, perpetual disqualification from public office, and 
confiscation or forfeiture in favor of the Government of any prohibited 
interest and unexplained wealth manifestly out of proportion to his 
salary and other lawful income. 


 Any 
complaining party
 at whose complaint the criminal 
prosecution was initiated shall, in case of conviction of the accused, 
be entitled to recover in the criminal action with priority over the 
forfeiture in favor of the Government, 
the amount of money or the thing he may have given to the accused, or the value of such thing. 




 Accordingly, the penalty imposed by the RTC, as affirmed by the 
Sandiganbayan, which is an imprisonment term ranging from six (6) years 
and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum, should be
 modified to include perpetual disqualification from holding public 
office. While the Sandiganbayan ordered the petitioner to return the Six
 Hundred Forty Thousand Pesos (P640,000.00) that she received from 
Malibiran, a legal interest rate of 6% 
per annum 
must also be imposed on the said amount to be computed from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.
[37]
 
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the instant petition is
 DENIED
.
 The Decision dated December 20, 2018 and the Resolution dated April 2, 
2019 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-18-A/R-0003 and SB-18-A/R-0004 are 
hereby
 AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION 
that, insofar as 
SB-18-A/R-0004, the penalty imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) 
month to eight (8) years and perpetual disqualification from public 
office should be imposed. In addition, a legal interest rate of six 
percent (6%) 
per annum
 is, likewise, imposed on the amount of Six
 Hundred Forty Thousand Pesos (P640,000.00) to be computed from the date
 of finality of this Decision until full payment.
