LEONEN, J.:


Subordinate legislation from specialized administrative agencies must 
"be germane to the objects and purposes of the law and . . . in 
conformity with, the standards prescribed by the law"
[1]
 to be held as a valid exercise of delegated legislative authority.

 The Department of Energy is the agency tasked with formulating rules 
and regulations that will animate the policy objectives of Republic Act 
No. 9136, or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA). The
 Energy Regulatory Commission, in turn, is tasked with implementing the 
EPIRA rules and regulations as formulated and issued by the Department 
of Energy. It is not empowered to supplant the Department of Energy's 
policies, rules, and regulations with its own issuances.
[2]
 

 This Court resolves these consolidated Petitions from electricity 
end-users and electric cooperatives under EPIRA. They claim that 
Department of Energy Circular No. DC2015-06-0010 and Energy Regulatory 
Commission Resolution Nos. 5, 10, 11, and 28, all series of 2016, are 
unconstitutional for usurping legislative authority, violating the right
 to due process, equal protection clause, and non-impairment clause, as 
well as being an unreasonable exercise of police power.
 On June 
8, 2001, the EPIRA was signed into law. It provided "a framework for the
 restructuring of the electric power industry, including the 
privatization of the assets of [National Power Corporation], the 
transition to the desired competitive structure, and the definition of 
the responsibilities of the various government agencies and private 
entities."
[3]
 
 In line 
with the EPIRA, the Department of Energy and the Energy Regulatory 
Commission issued several administrative issuances allowing electricity 
end-users in the contestable market to freely choose from the qualified 
retail electricity suppliers, including local retail electricity 
suppliers and distribution utilities within their franchise area.
[4]
 On June 19, 2015, the Department of Energy issued Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0010
[5]

 (Department Circular), which provided policies for the full 
implementation of Retail Competition and Open Access. The Department of 
Energy noted that only about 35% of the total number of contestable 
customers had chosen their retail electricity supplier and registered 
with the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation.
[6]
 This slow movement impacted its preparation of the Distribution Development Plan, particularly in demand forecasting.
[7]
 

 Thus, the Department Circular mandated all contestable customers with a
 monthly average peak demand of one megawatt (MW) which were still 
sourcing electricity from distribution utilities, to secure a retail 
supply contract from any of the following energy suppliers by June 25, 
2016: 
  


 Section 1. Compliance to Full Contestability by Contestable Customers with Average Demand of One (1) MW and Above. 


 All [Contestable Customers], which are currently being served by
 their franchised [Distribution Utilities], are mandated to secure their
 respective [Retail Service Contracts] no later than 25 June 2016, with 
any of the following: 








(a)


Any licensed [Retail Electricity Supplier]
; 






(b)


Any Generation Company
, 
currently owning and operating power generation facilities, duly issued a
 Certificate of Compliance (COC) by the [Energy Regulatory Commission] 
and is offering to serve the power requirements of any [Contestable 
Customers]: 
Provided
, That it secures a [Retail Electricity Supplier] license from the [Energy Regulatory Commission];






(c)


Any Prospective Generation Company
.
 As used in this Circular, a Prospective Generation Company shall refer 
to any Person or Entity that power generation project is undergoing 
construction or planned and has been included in the [Department of 
Energy's] Power Development Plan (PDP); 








Any [Retail Supply Contract] that the [Contestable Customer] 
entered into with a Prospective Generation Company shall be deemed 
compliant with the Mandatory Contestability prescribed in this Circular;
 


 The [Contestable Customer] and its counterparty [Retail 
Electricity Supplier], Generation Company or Prospective Generation 
Company shall submit to [the Department of Energy] and [Energy 
Regulatory Commission] their signed [Retail Supply Contract] for 
assessment, monitoring, policy and rule-making purposes particularly on 
the timelines and effectivity date of the [Retail Supply Contract].
[8]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The Department Circular likewise gave a similar deadline to 
end-users with a monthly average peak demand ranging from 750 kilowatt 
(kW) to 999 kW to secure a retail supply contract with a retail 
electricity supplier.
[9]
 It 
lowered the contestability threshold from one MW to below 750 kW and 
directed end-users with an average demand of 501 kW to below 750 kW to 
choose their retail electricity suppliers by June 26, 2018, subject to 
the Energy Regulatory Commission's evaluation of the retail market's 
performance.
[10]
 
 The 
Department Circular also directed the Energy Regulatory Commission to 
issue the necessary rules and procedures to resolve any displaced 
contract capacity or energy that the distribution utilities may 
experience due to the mandatory migration of their customers to Retail 
Competition and Open Access.
[11]
 
 On March 8, 2016, the Energy Regulatory 	Commission 	issued Resolution No. 5
[12]

 (ERC Resolution No. 5), which adopted the Rules Governing the Issuance 
of Licenses to Retail Electricity Suppliers and Prescribing the 
Requirements and Conditions Therefor.
[13]
 	Its Section 3 provided those that may be retail electricity suppliers: 
  


				 Section 3. Who may become a [Retail Electricity Supplier] 


 In accordance with the Act and its [Implementing Rules and 
Regulations], any of the following may become a [Retail Electricity 
Supplier]; 


  	Generation Company or Affiliate thereof; 
 An Affiliate of a [Distribution Utility] with respect to the 
latter's Contestable Market within or outside its Franchise Area, 
subject to restrictions imposed by the [Energy Regulatory Commission] on
 market share limits and the conduct of business activities;
 Retail Aggregators;
An Independent Power Producer (IPP) Administrator; and
 Any other Person intending to engage in the selling, 
brokering[,] or marketing of electricity to the Contestable Market, 
consistent with the Act and its [Implementing Rules and Regulations]. 


 The [Energy Regulatory Commission] shall not be precluded from 
imposing additional restrictions contained in separate rules issued, or 
still be issued by it. The [Energy Regulatory Commission], for 
justifiable reasons, may likewise exempt compliance by a [Retail 
Electricity Supplier] license holder to specific license conditions, 
taking into account the actual operations of such [Retail Electricity 
Supplier] license holder.
[14]




 On May 12, 2016, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued Resolution No. 10
[15]
 (ERC Resolution No. 10), which adopted the Revised Rules for Contestability.
[16]

 It mandated end-users with an average monthly peak demand of at least 
one MW to enter into a retail supply contract with a retail electricity 
supplier by December 26, 2016. It also mandated end-users with an 
average monthly peak demand of at least 750 kW to enter into a retail 
supply contract with a retail electricity supplier by June 26, 2017. It 
then allowed for retail aggregation by June 26, 2018, in which 
electricity suppliers may contract with groups of end-users with an 
aggregate demand of at least 750 kW per group.
[17]
 
 Also on May 12, 2016, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued Resolution No. 11
[18]

 (ERC Resolution No. 11), which imposed restrictions on distribution 
utilities and retail electricity suppliers in the Competitive Retail 
Electricity Market. It forbade distribution utilities from participating
 as suppliers in the contestable market and gave local retail 
electricity suppliers three years to wind down their business. It also 
barred them from entering into new retail supply contracts: 
  


	 NOW THEREFORE, pursuant to its mandate to promote competition 
and protect customer interests and to establish the ultimate goal of 
achieving a robust and competitive retail electricity market, the ERC 
hereby RESOLVES to ADOPT the following: 






1.


No Distribution Utility (DU) shall engage in the Supply of Electricity to End-users in the Contestable Market
 unless such supply is made in its capacity as a Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR).






 


 






2.


All Local Retail Electricity Suppliers (Local RES) shall wind down their business

 within three (3) years from effectivity [of] the instant Resolution. 
Existing Retail Supply Contracts (RSCs) entered into with their 
respective Contestable Customers shall remain valid until the expiration
 of the said contracts subject to the winding down period. Accordingly, 
no new RSCs shall be signed and executed after the effectivity of this 
Resolution.






 


 








During the said winding down period, 
the Local RES shall continue to comply with all reportorial requirements
 prescribed by the Commission. 






 


 






3.


No [Retail Electricity Supplier] shall 
be allowed to supply more than thirty percent (30%) of the total average
 monthly peak demand of all contestable customers in the [Competitive 
Retail Electricity Market]. The level demand shall be determined by the 
[Energy Regulatory Commission] on a quarterly basis which should be 
posted on the website every 30
th
 of the month following the quarter.






 


 






4.


No [Retail Electricity Supplier] shall 
be allowed to transact more than fifty percent (50%) of the total energy
 transactions of its Supply business, with its affiliate Contestable 
Customers. 






Any [Retail Electricity Supplier] not in compliance with this 
safeguard shall be given a period of two (2) years from 26 December 2016
 to comply therewith: 
Provided further
, That in no case shall it 
be allowed to execute any [Retail Service Contracts] with Affiliates, 
nor renew its [Retail Service Contracts] with the said affiliates unless
 such execution or renewal no longer amounts to a breach of the 
aforementioned safeguard.
[19]
 




 On November 15, 2016, the Energy Regulatory Commission issued Resolution No. 28
[20]

 (ERC Resolution No. 28), which amended the mandatory contestability 
date for end-users with an average monthly peak demand of at least one 
MW. Originally set on December 26, 2016 per the Revised Rules for 
Contestability, the deadline was moved to February 26, 2017.
[21]

 However, ERC Resolution No. 28 did not amend the mandatory 
contestability deadlines for end-users with an average monthly peak 
demand of at least 750 kW and 500 kW. 
 On December 27, 2016, 
petitioners Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, San Beda 
College Alabang, Inc., Ateneo de Manila University, and Riverbanks 
Development Corporation filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, 
and Injunction
[22]
 (First 
Petition) against respondents Department of Energy, Energy Regulatory 
Commission, and their respective officers. Petitioners claim to be 
end-users that have migrated to the contestable market to be able to 
freely choose from the retail electricity suppliers, including local 
retail electricity suppliers and distribution utilities, within their 
franchise area.
[23]
 
 
The First Petition asserts that under Section 31 of the EPIRA, any 
migration of electricity end-users to the contestable market is 
voluntary,
[24]
 as supported by congressional deliberations.
[25]

 It argues that respondents abandoned the clear policy of the EPIRA, 
which was to promote competition through greater end-user choice,
[26]
 when they issued the "patently unconstitutional" Department Circular, as well as ERC Resolution Nos. 5, 10, 11, and 28.
[27]
 

 The First Petition emphasizes that under ERC Resolution No. 10, an 
end-user that fails to enter into a retail supply contract before the 
deadline will be physically disconnected from its distribution utility. 
The same resolution also prohibited distribution utilities from 
supplying electricity, except as suppliers of last resort, which would 
"compel them to pay a 10% premium over the higher contract price and 
[Wholesale Electricity Spot Market] price."
[28]
 It also prohibited local retail electricity suppliers from entering into new retail supply contracts.
[29]

 The First Petition alleges that because of the assailed issuances, 
petitioners are forced to abrogate their current electricity supply 
contracts and negotiate on an unequal footing with the retail 
electricity suppliers accredited by respondent Energy Regulatory 
Commission.
[30]
 On January 17, 2017,
[31]
 this Court directed respondents to comment on the First Petition. 
 On January 30, 2017, Silliman University filed its own Petition for Certiorari
[32]
 (Second Petition), also seeking to nullify the assailed Department Circular and ERC Resolution No. 10, as amended.
[33]

 Petitioner Silliman University narrates that it received its 
Certificate of Contestability from respondent Energy Regulatory 
Commission on October 12, 2012. Pursuant to the deadline imposed in the 
Department Circular, it sought proposals from retail electricity 
suppliers, but failed to receive any firm proposals at a competitive 
rate. On April 12, 2016 it wrote respondent Energy Regulatory 
Commission, asking to be exempted from being a mandatory contestable 
customer.
[34]
 When this request was denied,
[35]
 it filed this Second Petition. 

 The Second Petition alleges that the Department Circular and ERC 
Resolution No. 10 are both invalid forms of subordinate legislation 
since they exceeded the mandate of the law they sought to implement. It 
points out that the EPIRA does not compel contestable customers to enter
 into retail supply contracts, as its language is merely permissive; on 
the other hand, the assailed issuances force contestable customers to 
contract with retail electricity suppliers.
[36]
 

 The Second Petition asserts that the Department Circular and ERC 
Resolution No. 10 went beyond the executive's power to regulate 
commerce.
[37]
 It adds that by 
forcing contestable customers to enter into contracts with the 23 
licensed retail electricity suppliers, respondents are creating a 
virtual oligopoly, which is contrary to the principles of free 
enterprise and anti-trust under the Constitution.
[38]
 
 Finally, the Second Petition claims that as a shareholder of Negros Oriental Electric Cooperative 2,
[39]

 petitioner enjoys rights as a co-owner and should not be forced to 
enter into a retail supply contract when it could patronize its own 
electric cooperative.
[40]
 

 On February 16, 2017, petitioners Batangas II Electric Cooperative, 
Inc., 	Peninsula 	Electric 	Cooperative, 	Inc., 	Camarines 	Sur 	I 	
Electric Cooperative, 	Inc., 	Iloilo 		I 	 Electric 	Cooperative, 	Inc.,
 	Aklan 	Electric Cooperative, 	 Inc., 		Capiz Electric 	Cooperative, 	
Inc., 	Antique 	Electric Cooperative, Inc., and Leyte III Electric 
Cooperative, Inc., all registered electric 	cooperatives, 	filed 	a 
Petition 	 for Certiorari, Prohibition, 	and Injunction
[41]

 (Third Petition) against respondents. 	 They likewise seek to nullify 
the Department Circular and ERC Resolution Nos. 5, 10, 11, and 28.
[42]

  The Third Petition argues that under the EPIRA's Retail Competition 
and Open Access, end-users that switch to the contestable market may 
choose their electricity supplier from either a retail electricity 
supplier or a local retail electricity supplier. It stresses that before
 the assailed issuances, local retail electricity suppliers of 
distribution utilities or electric cooperatives were not required to 
obtain licenses to operate within their existing franchise area. 
However, in defiance of the EPIRA, the assailed issuances prohibited 
them from contracting with contestable customers, even within their 
franchise areas.
[43]
 
The Third Petition underscores that such prohibition will cause electric
 cooperatives to lose some of their current clients and future business 
opportunities,
[44]
 depriving them of their right to engage in a legitimate business.
[45]

 Petitioners' constitutional right to equal protection is also allegedly
 violated, as the issuances discriminate against distribution utilities 
and electric cooperatives.
[46]
 It likewise raises that the issuances violate the constitutional guarantee of non-impairment of contracts.
[47]
 

 The Third Petition also claims that the assailed issuances are not 
valid exercises of police power because they do not serve the public 
interest and even impede, rather than foster, free and open competition 
by removing electric cooperatives and distribution utilities from the 
qualified retail electricity suppliers for contestable customers. It 
adds that excluding electric cooperatives and distribution utilities 
from the contestable market will raise electricity rates in the captive 
market.
[48]
 
 The Third 
Petition advances that the assailed issuances are void for usurping 
legislative functions, as they went beyond the scope of the EPIRA by 
prohibiting distribution utilities and electric cooperatives from 
participating in the contestable market.
[49]


 On February 21, 2017,
[50]
 the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining respondents from implementing the assailed issuances: 
  


 NOW, THEREFORE, effective immediately and continuing until 
further orders from this Court, You, respondents Department of Energy 
(DOE), DOE Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi, Energy Regulatory Commission 
[ERC], ERC Chairperson Jose Vicente B. Salazar and ERC  Commissioners 
Alfredo J. Non, Gloria Victoria C. Yap-Taruc, Josefina Patricia M. 
Asirit and Geronimo D. Sta. Ana, your agents, representatives, or 
persons acting in your place or stead, are hereby ENJOINED from 
implementing and enforcing DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0010, Series of 
2015, ERC Resolution No. 5, Series of 2016, ERC Resolution No. 10, 
Series of 2016, ERC Resolution No. 11, Series of 2016, and ERC 
Resolution No. 28, Series of 2016.
[51]




 On March 1, 2017,
[52]
 this Court consolidated all three Petitions. 
 Two Petitions-in-Intervention
[53]

 assailing the same issuances from respondents Department of Energy and 
Energy Regulatory Commission were also filed before this Court. 
 
Petitioners-intervenors Maynilad Water Services, Inc., Silgan White Cap 
Southeast Asia, Inc., and Fastech Electronique, Inc. claim to be captive
 customers that purchase electricity from Manila Electric Company but 
are negotiating with retail electricity suppliers.
[54]

 On the other hand, petitioners-intervenors Jocelyn Forge, Inc. and 
Lyceum of the Philippines-Batangas assert that they are also captive 
customers that have reached a monthly average peak of demand of 
approximately 750 kW.
[55]
 

 As current captive customers with an average monthly peak demand of 
approximately 750 kW to 999 kW, both groups of petitioners-intervenors 
express concern about the effect that Phase Two of the assailed 
issuances, or the mandatory switching by customers with an average 
monthly peak demand of 750 kW to 999 kW, will have on them since it 
restricted their choice of suppliers while also decreeing the mandatory 
migration of all qualified contestable customers.
[56]
 

 Both Petitions-in-Intervention claim that this Court's Temporary 
Restraining Order, meant to maintain status quo and prevent the forcible
 migration into the contestable market, was erroneously interpreted by 
respondents and the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation to include
 even voluntary switching or migration into the contestable market. As 
such, voluntary switching was held in abeyance and 
petitioners-intervenors were prevented from contracting with their 
chosen retail electricity suppliers.
[57]

 Thus, they ask this Court to clarify that the Temporary Restraining 
Order only covered the mandatory migration to the contestable market and
 	 excluded voluntary migration.
[58]
 
 	 In their Comment,
[59]

 respondents Department of Energy and Energy Regulatory Commission, 
represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, claim that the 
assailed issuances were issued in the exercise of their 
quasi-legislative power; hence, Rule 65 is an improper remedy since it 
is a remedy available against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising 
judicial or quasi-judicial functions.
[60]

 They also claim that the cases cited by petitioners, supporting their 
claim that certiorari is the appropriate remedy, were exceptional cases 
that invoked this Court's expanded jurisdiction and do not apply to 
quasi-legislative acts issued by administrative agencies.
[61]

 Respondents state that petitioners prematurely availed of a petition 
for certiorari under Rule 65 considering they failed to first exhaust 
the available administrative remedies under the Energy Regulatory 
Commission Rules of Procedure and Practice, the available speedy, plain,
 and adequate remedy.
[62]
 Respondents also point out that there is no actual case that would require judicial review, or 
prima facie
 evidence of grave abuse of discretion, in promulgating the assailed issuances.
[63]
 

 Respondents also assail petitioners' standing in the First Petition, 
saying that being compelled to migrate to the contestable market did not
 cause them direct or potential injury.
[64]
 

 On the substantive issues, respondents assert that they acted within 
the bounds of law when they issued the assailed issuances. They claim 
that Section 31 of the EPIRA requires end-users upon reaching threshold 
electricity demand to migrate from the captive market to the contestable
 market. They further claim that the EPIRA granted respondent Department
 of Energy encompassing quasi-legislative authority to formulate rules 
and regulations, as well as "awesome"
[65]

 regulatory powers to exercise other powers necessary or incidental to 
implement the EPIRA and restructure the electric power industry.
[66]
 

 Respondents aver that distribution utilities have no statutory right to
 supply electricity in the contestable market. Instead, it is respondent
 Energy Regulatory Commission that has the power to determine the 
supplier in the contestable market.
[67]

 Respondents claim that distribution utilities are only authorized to 
supply electricity in the captive market and not in the contestable 
market.
[68]
 They allege that 
the previous allowance for distribution utilities to provide electricity
 supply in the contestable market, despite the wording of the EPIRA, was
 only a temporary measure to address a projected gap in the supply, and 
was only meant until the gap could be addressed by the incoming retail 
electricity suppliers.
[69]
 

 Respondents maintain that the assailed issuances were not issued to 
recognize the statutory right of contestable customers to choose their 
electricity supplier, but formed part of restructuring the electric 
industry that respondent Energy Regulatory Commission implemented per 
its mandate under the EPIRA to facilitate the establishment of the 
Retail Competition and Open Access.
[70]
 

 Respondents assert that the migration of contestable customers to the 
contestable market is mandatory. They claim that the phrase "shall 
allow" under Section 31 of the EPIRA should be read in relation to the 
provision's entirety.
[71]
 They
 also claim that it will be difficult to create a substantial 
contestable market that will entice business entities to engage in 
supplying electricity if end-users are given the option to voluntarily 
migrate from captive market to the contestable market.
[72]

 They also state that the mandatory migration will foster competition in
 the supply sector, which would lower electricity prices and not, as 
petitioners fear, create a "virtual cartelization" of the contestable 
market.
[73]
 
 
Respondents maintain that the issuances on physical disconnection or the
 payment of premiums for failure to timely execute a retail supply 
contract are valid, considering the mandatory migration to the 
contestable market of the affected end-users required by the EPIRA.
[74]

 However, they manifested that respondent Energy Regulatory Commission 
has already proposed amending the supplier of last resort premium from 
the original rate of 10% to 2% for the first and second billing periods,
 6% for the third and fourth billing periods, and 8% for the fifth and 
sixth billing periods. Further, the premium will not be imposed until 
three months after the mandatory contestability period of February 26, 
2017.
[75]
 
 Respondents 
assert that the assailed issuances do not violate the non-impairment 
clause because a franchise is in the nature of a grant, which is not 
covered by the non-impairment clause.
[76]
 They also maintain that the issuances were valid exercises of police power delegated to them by Congress.
[77]
 
 Respondents claim that the issuance of a status 
quo ante

 order or temporary restraining order is not warranted because, first, 
petitioners have no clear and unmistakable legal right that ought to be 
protected since the issuances were valid. Second, the EPIRA authorizes 
distribution utilities to supply electricity without a license only in 
the captive market; the local retail electricity suppliers, or the 
supply arms of distribution utilities, do not have a statutory right to 
supply electricity in the contestable market.
[78]
 

 Respondents claim that petitioners failed to show that they will suffer
 any grave and irreparable injury if injunctive relief is not issued. 
However, they point out that even if petitioners successfully prove that
 they will suffer injury, that injury is not irreparable because it is 
pecuniary in nature and can be compensated. Respondents emphasize that 
with the issuance of a temporary restraining order, it is the public 
that will suffer grave and irreparable injury because the implementation
 of the Retail Competition and Open Access will once again be delayed.
[79]
 In their Consolidated Comment
[80]

 to the Second and Third Petitions, respondents reiterate that the 
assailed issuances are consistent with the EPIRA's objective of complete
 migration of all end-users from the captive market to the contestable 
market.
[81]
 They further assert that allowing distribution utilities in the contestable market will defeat the essence of open access.
[82]

 They point out that the franchise of distribution utilities and 
electric cooperatives is limited to their captive customers; hence, they
 cannot point to a right to operate in the contestable market.
[83]

 The previous permission granted to distribution utilities to supply 
electricity to the contestable market was merely an interim measure in 
view of the necessary transition toward the desired scenario of full 
migration.
[84]
 
 
Respondents likewise deny that the assailed issuances violated 
petitioners-intervenors' freedom to contract because contestable 
customers have other options aside from entering into retail supply 
contracts with retail electricity suppliers.
[85]

 They also assert that the issuances do not violate the non-impairment 
clause, as the latter does not apply to non-finalized power supply 
agreements and retail supply contracts,
[86]

 or the right to property, as distribution utilities have no 
constitutional right to supply electricity to the contestable market.
[87]


	 The National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms, Inc. (NASECORE),
[88]
 AC Energy Holdings, Inc. (AC Energy),
[89]
 and PHINMA Energy Corporation (Phinma)
[90]
 then filed their respective Comments-in-Intervention. 
  
 NASECORE and AC Energy both maintain that Section 31 of the 
EPIRA granted respondents the power to define the contestable market,
[91]
 with NASECORE adding that mandatory migration is also included.
[92]

 NASECORE points out that the EPIRA itself categorically states in 
Section 75 that its provisions should "be construed in favor of the 
establishment, promotion, preservation of competition[;] and people 
empowerment so that the widest participation of the people, whether 
directly or indirectly, is ensured."
[93]

 Meanwhile, AC Energy avers that mandatory migration is the only logical
 interpretation in light of the legislative intent of full 
contestability down to the household level, in effect freeing all 
end-users from the captive market.
[94]
 

 For its part, Phinma asserts that the prohibition on a distribution 
utility from directly participating in the contestable market was the 
only way to assure a free and competitive electricity marketplace.
[95]
 
 NASECORE then proclaims that the assailed issuances were reasonable state regulations
[96]
 and valid exercises of respondents' police power
[97]

 to dismantle the existing monopoly and provide end-users with "fair and
 reasonable electricity prices brought about by retail competition."
[98]
 
 Additionally, NASECORE underscores that the assailed issuances, in prohibiting distribution utilities
[99]

 and local retail electricity suppliers from participating in the 
contestable market, did not violate the equal protection clause because 
there were substantial differences between local retail electricity 
suppliers and retail electricity suppliers, and end-users in the captive
 market and contestable market.
[100]
 

 Finally, AC Energy and Phinma both contend that the voluntary migration
 to the contestable market is not in issue; hence, this Court's decision
 should only be limited to the matters raised, such as the mandatory 
migration and prohibition of distribution utilities from the captive 
market.
[101]
 In their respective replies,
[102]
 petitioners and petitioners-intervenors insist that the assailed issuances are 
ultra vires
[103]
 for amending the EPIRA in a way that is not germane to the purpose of the law.
[104]

 Petitioner Silliman University underscores that while the EPIRA's 
ultimate goal was to allow for contestability up to the household level,
 the "democratization of the market cannot be done undemocratically."
[105]
 Petitioners also assert that the assailed issuances violated their freedom to contract.
[106]

 They supposedly gave unfair negotiating leverage to the accredited 
retail electricity suppliers, which merely had to sit back and wait for 
the end-users, the ones being forced to enter into lopsided negotiations
 to meet the enforced deadline.
[107]
 

 Finally, petitioners maintain that this Court's issuance of a temporary
 restraining order led to an increase in the number of registered 
contestable customers in the contestable market as greater market 
competition resulted, which, in turn, enticed the qualified end-users to
 voluntarily migrate to the contestable market.
[108]

 They stress that "a market that promotes greater end-user choice and 
allow[s] the most number of qualified suppliers to compete for 
petitioners' and other end-users' business"
[109]
 was what was most beneficial to end-users and what was intended by the EPIRA.
[110]
 
 On December 19, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General
[111]

 manifested that it would no longer be representing respondent 
Department of Energy, but clarified that it would still be acting on 
respondent Energy Regulatory Commission's behalf: 
  


 3. The OSG also manifests that it will only be representing the 
ERC in this case from hereon, as the Department of Energy (DOE) has 
communicated to the OSG its recent views in the present case last 22 
November 2017. Upon an in-depth study of the case, the OSG manifests 
before the Honorable Court that it maintains and shares the ERC's views 
that (a) the local retail electricity suppliers (RES) of distribution 
utilities (DUs) should be prohibited from participating as suppliers in 
the contestable market pursuant to Republic Act No. 9136 ("EPIRA"), and 
(b)  the migration of end-users, upon reaching the threshold for 
contestabiiity under Section 31 of the EPIRA, to the contestable market 
is mandatory.
[112]
 




 On April 5, 2018, respondent Department of Energy filed a separate Comment
[113]

 to the consolidated Petitions and Petitions-in-Intervention, with 
motion for early resolution. It admits that after reviewing its assailed
 Department Circular and comparing it with its previous Retail 
Competition and Open Access-related issuances, it found the Department 
Circular to be inconsistent with the EPIRA, particularly with its 
requirement for the mandatory migration to the contestable market.
[114]

 Respondent Department of Energy says that it manifested to the Office 
of the Solicitor General its intention to issue new policy directives 
which would more accurately reflect the EPIRA, but the Office of the 
Solicitor General said it would maintain its original position and would
 only represent respondent Energy Regulatory Commission moving forward.
[115]
 
 Respondent Department of Energy states that all of its Retail Competition and Open Access-related issuances
[116]

 prior to the assailed Department Circular consistently upheld the 
customers' power of choice to migrate to the contestable retail market.
[117]

 It admits that its assailed Department Circular departed from the 
intent of the EPIRA when it restricted the participation of distribution
 utilities in the supply sector to its captive customers.
[118]


 Respondent Department of Energy states that on November 29, 2017, it issued Department Circular Nos. DC2017-12-0013
[119]
 and DC2017-12-0014.
[120]

 	These issuances supposedly revoked and rectified the policies in the 
assailed Department Circular to reflect the true intent of the EPIRA.
[121]

 Respondent 	adds that with its rectification, the 	guidelines issued 	
by respondent Energy Regulatory Commission became devoid of legal basis:
 
  


 23. With the rectification by DOE of its RCOA policies primarily
 those that are contained in DOE DC2015-06-0010, the regulatory 
guidelines anchored and issued in accordance thereof, now stand without 
legal basis. Under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7638 (otherwise known 
as the Department of Energy Act of 1992) the responsibility and 
authority to "prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all 
plans, programs[,] projects, and activities of the Government relative 
to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution[,] and 
conservation" is vested with the DOE.
[122]




 Thus, respondent Department of Energy asserts that there was no 
longer any justiciable issue for the Court's consideration, rendering 
the case moot.
[123]
 
 The issues for this Court's resolution are: 
 First, whether or not the assailed issuances should be struck down for being 
ultra vires
; and

 Second, whether or not the Petitions have been mooted by respondent 
Department of Energy's revocation of its assailed Department Circular. 
 
I


 Electricity is recognized as a basic necessity "whose generation and distribution is imbued with public interest";
[124]

 thus, providing electricity to the entire country, especially the rural
 areas, has always been a principal concern of the government.
[125]
 

 Prior to the EPIRA, all electricity end-users belonged to the captive 
market, as they could not choose their electricity suppliers and had no 
option but to be serviced by the electricity supplier that had 
jurisdiction over the area. But with the EPIRA enacted and the Retail 
Competition and Open Access implemented, end-users down to the household
 level would soon be able to choose their own electricity suppliers. 
This is apparent in Section 31 of the EPIRA: 
  


 SECTION 31. 
Retail Competition and Open Access
. â Any law
 to the contrary notwithstanding, retail competition and open access on 
distribution wires shall be implemented not later than three (3) years 
upon the effectivity of this Act, subject to the following conditions: 




 (a) Establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market;
 
      (b) Approval of unbundled transmission and distribution wheeling charges;
 
      (c) Initial implementation of the cross subsidy removal scheme; 

      (d) Privatization of at least seventy (70%) percent of the total 
capacity of generating assets of NPC in Luzon and Visayas; and
 
      (e) Transfer of the management and control of at least seventy 
percent (70%) of the total energy output of power plants under contract 
with [National Power Corporation] to the [Independent Power Producers] 
Administrators. 




 Upon the initial implementation of open access, the [Energy 
Regulatory Commission] shall allow all electricity end-users with a 
monthly average peak demand of at least one megawatt (1MW) for the 
preceding twelve (12) months to be the contestable market. Two (2) years
 thereafter, the threshold level for the contestable market shall be 
reduced to seven hundred fifty kilowatts (750kW). At this level, 
aggregators shall be allowed to supply electricity to end-users whose 
aggregate demand within a contiguous area is at least seven hundred 
fifty kilowatts (750kW). Subsequently and every year thereafter, the 
[Energy Regulatory Commission] shall evaluate the performance of the 
market. On the basis of such evaluation, it shall gradually reduce the 
threshold level until it reaches the household demand level. In the case
 of electric cooperatives, retail competition and open access shall be 
implemented not earlier than five (5) years upon the effectivity of this
 Act. 




 Retail Competition and Open Access paved the way for the creation 
of the Competitive Retail Electricity Market, where qualified end-users 
in the contestable market and retail electricity suppliers can directly 
enter into electricity supply contracts with each other. The EPIRA 
anticipated that robust competition among retail electricity suppliers 
in the contestable market will eventually lead to lower electricity 
rates and improved services. 
 The controversy before us hinges on
 the proper interpretation of "shall allow" in Section 31, in relation 
to the transfer of a qualified end-user to the contestable market. 
 Petitioners contend that the migration is merely voluntary,
[126]
 as evidenced by congressional deliberations
[127]
 on the EPIRA law and the EPIRA's policy of promoting competition through greater end-user choice.
[128]
 

 On the other hand, respondents assert that the migration is mandatory, 
as supported by the EPIRA itself. They posit that the assailed issuances
 providing for mandatory migration fall under respondent Department of 
Energy's power and function under the EPIRA to formulate rules and 
regulations to implement the objectives of the law.
[129]
 
 Respondents are mistaken. 
  
 It is well established that when the law is clear and unambiguous, "it should be applied as written."
[130]
 Further, the statute must be construed as a whole 	to 	give 	effect 	to 	all 	its 	provisions.
[131]
 
National 	Tobacco Administration v. Commission on Audit
[132]
 instructs: 
  


 Cardinal is the rule in statutory construction "that the 
particular words, clauses and phrases should not be studied as detached 
and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute 
must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in 
order to produce a harmonious whole. A statute must be so construed as 
to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible." 
And the rule â that statute must be construed as a whole â requires that
 apparently conflicting provisions should be reconciled and harmonized, 
if at all possible.
[133]
 (Citations omitted) 




 A plain interpretation of the phrase "shall allow" implies that an
 endÂ­ user has requested to transfer to the contestable market to the 
Energy Regulatory Commission for its approval. The use of "shall" prior 
to "allow" signifies that it is mandatory upon the Energy Regulatory 
Commission to grant the request if the applicant end-user meets all of 
the requisites for transfer to the contestable market. Nothing in 
Section 31 insinuates that an end-user's transfer to the contestable 
market is automatic. 
 Department of Energy Circular No. 
DC2012-05-0005 (Prescribing the General Policies for the Implementation 
of the Retail Competition and Open Access) supports the voluntary 
transfer to the contestable market by recognizing the contestable 
customer's choice of its electricity supplier and directing respondent 
Energy Regulatory Commission to certify the eligible contestable 
customers before the implementation of the retail competition and open 
access: 
  


 Section 4. Customer's Choice. Upon Open Access Date, 
a [Contestable Customer (CC)] shall be allowed to choose where to source its electricity
.
 For this purpose, a CC can source from a Generation Company, a 
Supplier, an affiliate of a [Distribution Utility (DU)] which has 
constituted itself as a Supplier, or the Supply Business of a 
Distribution Utility (DU) within its franchise area. 




 4.1. All CCs shall only deal with a supplier of electricity 
duly licensed by the ERC. This includes DUs that have structurally or 
functionally unbundled their business into Wire and Supply businesses, 
duly approved by the ERC. 


 4.2. 
The ERC shall certify all eligible CCs at least six (6) months prior to the initial implementation of the RCOA
.
 For this purpose, all DUs are hereby mandated to provide DOE, ERC[,] 
and PEMC the list of CCs including pertinent information, such as but 
not limited to load profile for the last twelve (12) months, name of 
customers, among others. 


 4.3. The PEMC is hereby directed to register all eligible CCs 
certified by the ERC within three (3) months prior to Open Access Date.
[134]
 (Emphasis supplied) 






 Department of Energy Circular No. DC2012-11-0010 (Providing for 
Additional Guidelines and Implementing Policies for Retail Competition 
and Open Access and Amending Department Circular No. DC2012-05-0005)
[135]

 then tasked respondent Energy Regulatory Commission with, among others,
 specifying the contestable market by issuing certificates of 
contestability "to electricity end-users with an average twelve months 
peak demand of one (1) megawatt and above[.]"
[136]
 

 Notably, "mandatory contestability" was only mentioned for the first 
time in Department Circular No. DC2012-11-0010, but this was used 
alongside "customer choice" and with reference to the Retail Open 
Competition Access's promotion of genuine competition and customer 
choice: 
  


 
Section 7. Mandatory Contestability and Customer Choice. 
Consistent
 with the EPIRA, the RCOA should promote genuine competition, greater 
efficiency, customer choice, and the true cost of electricity. For this 
purpose, the power of choice is conferred to Contestable Customers 
subject to the rules and regulations prescribed herein as well as to 
subsequent issuances by the DOE. 


 Accordingly, all Contestable Customers shall be allowed to 
choose where to source its supply of electricity. For this purpose, any 
Contestable Customer may source its electricity supply requirements from
 a Supplier duly licensed by ERC, a Local Supplier duly authorized by 
ERC to perform such, or through the WESM. In the latter case, the 
Contestable Customer shall be responsible to manage its registration and
 compliance with the WESM Rules and Manuals, and managing its own risks 
as well. 


 As a general policy, a Contestable Customer can have one 
Supplier of electricity per Metering Point. Thus, any Contestable 
Customer may have several contracted Suppliers based on the number of 
its Metering Points. However, should a Contestable Customer opts (sic) 
to enter into a (sic) multiple supply contracts even with only single 
Metering Point, it shall be allowed, provided arrangements shall be 
consistent with the Circular and the Retail Rules to be promulgated by 
the DOE, and ERC rules and regulations.
[137]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 In Department of Energy Circular No. DC2013-07-0013
[138]

 (Providing Supplemental Policies to Empower the Contestable Customers 
under the Regime of Retail Competition and Open Access and Ensure 
Greater Competition in the Generation and Supply Sectors of the 
Philippine Electric Power Industry), respondent Department of Energy 
noted the concerns raised by a significant number of contestable 
customers that they were having difficulty obtaining offers for retail 
supply contracts from retail electricity suppliers,
[139]
 as well as the perception of the Retail Competition Open Access as a suppliers' market.
[140]

 This prompted it to issue supplemental policies to empower contestable 
customers and promote "greater competition in the generation and supply 
sectors in order to achieve the objectives of [Retail Competition and 
Open Access.)"
[141]
 
 
Like the previous department circulars, Department Circular No. 
2013-07-0013 also emphasized customer choice, with the contestable 
customer at liberty to source its electricity supply from licensed and 
authorized local retail electricity suppliers "and, on its option, 
directly through the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market."
[142]
 

 Additionally, Department Circular No. DC2013-07-0013 empowered 
contestable customers to switch to a more favorable contract with 
another retail electricity supplier, but counterbalanced this with a 
matching option for the incumbent retail electricity suppliers to retain
 their respective retail supply contracts by matching the new offer.
[143]
 

 This reflects the EPIRA's underlying objective of creating a free and 
competitive market that will provide reliable electricity at reasonable 
prices.
[144]
 The concept of 
"true market competition" is echoed repeatedly in the EPIRA, with 
Section 2(c) of the law declaring it a State policy "[t]o ensure 
transparent and reasonable prices of electricity in a regime of free and
 fair competition and full public accountability[.]"
 In its Comment with Motion for Early Resolution,
[145]

 respondent Department of Energy admits that upon further scrutiny of 
the assailed issuances, it found palpable inconsistencies with the 
EPIRA, particularly on the mandatory migration of eligible end-users to 
the contestable market and the prohibition imposed on distribution 
utilities from supplying electricity outside their captive market.
[146]
 It state: 
  


 15. In all the above-cited issuances, the power of choice of the
 customers was consistently upheld in that the option of whether or not 
to migrate to the Contestable Retail Market (CREM) was given to them. 
This brings us to the core of DC2015-06-0010 which departed from the 
previous policy issuances of the DOE and provided for mandatory 
migration of eligible customers to the CREM. Thus: 




 "
Section 1. Compliance to Full Contestability by Contestable Customers with Average Demand of One (1) MW and Above.
 All CCs which are currently being served by their franchised DUs, are mandated to secure their respective RSCs 
not later than 25 June 2016
." 


 
Section 2. Contestability of End-Users with Average Demand from 750kW and above. 


 All CCs with average demand ranging from 750kW and 999kW 
for the preceding 12-month period, are mandated to secure their RSCs 
with a RES no later than 	June 2016;
 Effective 26 June 2016, all Aggregators shall be allowed to
 compete 	with RES, Generation Companies[,] [and] Prospective Generation
 Companies; 
 In the case of retail aggregation, any CCs within a 
contiguous area may individually or collectively aggregate their 
electricity supplier requirements to an Aggregator duly licensed with 
the ERC. The aggregated demand shall in no case be lower than 750kW.
[147]
 (Emphasis in the original) 






 
Equi-Asia Placement, Inc. v. Department of Foreign Affairs
[148]

  stressed that the resulting complexities of modem life called for the 
exercise of delegated legislative authority by specialized 
administrative agencies. Nonetheless, regulations issued under the power
 of subordinate legislation must still conform to the law it seeks to 
enforce: 
  


 All that is required for the valid exercise of this power of 
subordinate legislation is that the regulation must be germane to the 
objects and purposes of the law; and that the regulation be not in 
contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by 
the law. Under the first test or the so-called completeness test, the 
law must be complete in all its terms and conditions when it leaves the 
legislature such that when it reaches the delegate, the only thing he 
will have to do is to enforce it. The second test or the sufficient 
standard test, mandates that there should be adequate guidelines or 
limitations in the law to determine the boundaries of the delegate's 
authority and prevent the delegation from running riot.
[149]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Thus, to be a valid delegation of legislative power, the 
subordinate legislation issued by specialized administrative agencies 
such as respondents must "be germane to the objects and purposes of the 
law and . . . in conformity with, the standards prescribed by the law."
[150]
 The EPIRA champions customer choice and allows contestable customers to choose from either franchise holders
[151]
 who have unbundled
[152]
 their business or non-regulated electricity suppliers.
[153]
 Clearly, as respondent Department of Energy itself admits,
[154]

 the mandatory migration of qualified end-users to the contestable 
market required in the assailed issuances finds no basis in the law they
 seek to implement.
 
II


 The EPIRA reorganized the electric power industry by dividing 
it into generation, transmission, distribution, and supply sectors.
[155]

 It then required electric power industry participants to "functionally 
and structurally unbundle [their] business activities and rates"
[156]
 to correspond to the reorganized sectors. 

 For the supply side, the EPIRA included public utilities like 
distribution utilities and electric cooperatives as part of the supply 
sector and exempted them from procuring a license from respondent Energy
 Regulatory Commission: 
  


 SECTION 29. Supply Sector. - The supply sector is a business affected with public interest. 
Except
 for distribution utilities and electric cooperatives with respect to 
their existing franchise areas, all suppliers of electricity to the 
contestable market shall require a license from the ERC
.


 For this purpose, the ERC shall promulgate rules and regulations
 prescribing the qualifications of electricity suppliers which shall 
include, among other requirements, a demonstration of their technical 
capability, financial capability, and creditworthiness: Provided, That 
the ERC shall have authority to require electricity suppliers to furnish
 a bond or other evidence of the ability of a supplier to withstand 
market disturbances or other events that may increase the cost of 
providing service. 


 Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, supply of electricity 
to the contestable market shall not be considered a public utility 
operation. For this purpose, any person or entity which shall engage in 
the supply of electricity to the contestable market shall not be 
required to secure a national franchise. 


 The prices to be charged by suppliers for the supply of 
electricity to the contestable market shall not be subject to regulation
 by the ERC. 


 Electricity suppliers shall be subject to the rules and 
regulations concerning abuse of market power, cartelization, and other 
anti-competitive or discriminatory behavior to be promulgated by the 
ERC. 


 In its billings to end-users, every supplier shall identify and 
segregate the components of its supplier's charge, as defined herein. 
(Emphasis supplied) 




 Taking its cue from the EPIRA and its emphasis on customer choice,
 Department Circular No. DC2012-05-0005 allowed distribution utilities 	
 which unbundled their business or constituted itself as a supplier, to 
supply electricity in the contestable market: 
  


 Section 4. Customer's Choice. Upon Open Access Date, a 
[Contestable Customer] shall be allowed to choose where to source its 
electricity. For this purpose, 
a [Contestable Customer] can source from a Generation Company; a Supplier, an affiliate of a [Distribution Utility] which has
 
constituted itself as a Supplier, or the Supply Business of a Distribution Utility (DU) within its franchise area
.




 4.1. All [Contestable Customers] shall only deal with a 
supplier of electricity duly licensed by the [Energy Regulatory 
Commission]. This includes [Distribution Utilities] that have 
structurally or functionally unbundled their business into Wire and 
Supply businesses, duly approved by the [Energy Regulatory Commission]. 


 4.2. The [Energy Regulatory Commission] shall certify all 
eligible [Contestable Customers] at least six (6) months prior to the 
initial implementation of the [Retail Competition and Open Access]. For 
this purpose, all [Distribution Utilities] are hereby mandated to 
provide [Department of Energy], [Energy Regulatory Commission] and 
[Philippine Electricity Market Corporation] the list of [Contestable 
Customers] including pertinent information, such as but not limited to 
load profile for the last twelve (12) months, name of customers, among 
others. 


 4.3. The [Philippine Electricity Market Corporation] is hereby
 directed to register all eligible [Contestable Customers] certified by 
the [Energy Regulatory Commission] within three (3) months prior to Open
 Access Date. 




 . . . .


 Section 13. Protection for Captive Customers. 




 13.1. Consistent with its mandate under the EPIRA, 
[Distribution Utilities] shall secure Supply Contracts in the least cost
 manner for its Captive Customers. 


 13.2. 
[Distribution Utilities] may continue to provide 
electricity services to [Contestable Customers] within its franchise 
area as a local Supplier, a separate entity
.
[157]
 (Emphasis supplied) 






 Department Circular No. DC2012-05-0005 also allowed bundled 
distribution utilities to have limited participation in the contestable 
market as suppliers of last resort.
[158]
 

 Subsequently, Department of Energy Circular No. DC2012-11-0010 revised 
Section 2 of DC2012-05-0005 to include "Local Supplier" in its 
Definition of Terms, recognizing the participation of unbundled 
distribution utilities as suppliers within their franchise area: 	 
  


4.2 A new definition is hereby added to Section 2 of Department Circular No. DC2012-05-0005, as follows:   




 1) "Local Supplier" refers to the non-regulated supply 
business of a Distribution Utility (DU) catering to the Contestable 
Customers within its franchise area, duly authorized by the [Energy 
Regulatory Commission]. This shall also include the Philippine Economic 
Zone Authority (PEZA) and the PEZA-accredited Utility Ecozone 
Enterprises in the public and private Economic Zones (EZs), 
respectively. 






 It also restated the distribution utilities' status as suppliers 
of last resort, with the addition that they were allowed to become 
suppliers of last resort even outside their franchise areas in 
exceptional circumstances.
[159]

 Department Circular No. DC2013-07-0013 then listed local retail 
electricity suppliers, or the "non-regulated business segment of the 
[distribution utility],"
[160]
 as among the Energy Regulatory Commission-approved suppliers that contestable customers can choose from,
[161]
 acknowledging the participation of unbundled distribution utilities in the contestable market.

 Respondent Department of Energy again admits that when it came to the 
participation of distribution utilities in the supply sector, the 
assailed issuances "made a substantial departure from the intent and 
letter of the EPIRA":
[162]




 16. DC2015-06-0010, likewise, made a substantial departure from 
the intent and letter of the EPIRA in terms of the supply side as 
implemented in the earlier DOE issuance by the (sic) restricting 
participation of DUs in the supply sector. Thus, while DC2012-05-0005 
upholds the policy of customer choice, to wit: 




 
Section 1. Declaration of Policy.
 Consistent with the 
EPIRA it is hereby declared that the transition to RCOA should promote 
genuine competition, greater efficiency, customer choice, and the true 
cost of electricity. 


 For this purpose, the power of choice of supplier as 
envisioned in the EPIRA is hereby provided to Contestable Customers 
(CCs) subject to the rules and regulations herein discussed as well as 
to subsequent rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the DOE. 


 x x x 


 
Section 4. Customer Choice. 
Upon Open Access Date, a CC
 shall be allowed to choose where to source its electricity. For this 
purpose, a CC can source from a Generation Company, a Supplier, 
an 
affiliate of a DU which has constituted itself as a Supplier, or the 
Supply Business of a Distribution Utility (DU) within its franchise 
area.
 




 4.1. All CCs shall only deal with a supplier of electricity duly licensed by the ERC. 
This
 includes DUs that have structurally or functionally unbundled their 
business into Wire and Supply businesses, duly approved by the ERC."
 






 DC2015-06-0010, on the other hand, has laid down the policy of 
prohibiting DUs from engaging in the supply business beyond its captive 
customers. Thus: 




 
Section 5. Licensing of Retail Electricity Suppliers. 
Pursuant
 to the EPIRA, any entity engaged in the distribution of electricity to 
End-Users shall provide open and non-discriminatory access to its 
distribution system. To ensure compliance with this EPIRA provision, and
 that all players are afforded a level playing field, the DOE is 
cognizant that ERC is in the process of reviewing its guidelines taking

DC2015-06-0010 with the EPIRA, Section 29, in conjunction with Section 
36 all of the EPIRA, allows DUs to register as RES, provided they comply
 with the unbundling requirements mandated by law. Thus: 




 SEC. 29. Supply Sector. - The supply sector is a business affected with public interest. 
Except for distribution utilities and electric cooperatives with respect to their existing franchise areas
, all suppliers of electricity to the contestable market shall require a license from the ERC.

 Any electric power industry participant shall functionally and

 full compliance with this provision. . . .




 Notwithstanding the above-quoted provisions of the EPIRA, 
DC2015-06- 0010 provides, as a matter of policy, that DUs cannot engage 
in the supply business beyond its captive customers.
[163]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 Undoubtedly, the assailed issuances are 
ultra vires
 for 
going beyond the limits of authority conferred to respondent 
administrative agencies. They should, therefore, be struck down. 
 
III


 Respondent Department of Energy claims that, in any case, since it issued Department Circular Nos. DC2017-12-0013
[164]
 and DC2017-12- 0014,
[165]
 the assailed issuances have been rectified, mooting any real justiciable controversy for this Court's resolution.
[166]
 
 Respondent is mistaken. 
 This Court's power of judicial review is limited to an actual case or controversy,
[167]
 or a conflict of legal rights or opposite legal claims capable of judicial resolution and a specific relief.
[168]
 The controversy must be real and must require a specific relief that this Court can grant.
[169]

 A case is rendered moot when there is no longer a conflict of legal 
rights which would entail judicial review. This Court is precluded from 
ruling on moot cases, where no justiciable controversy exists. However, 
exceptions do exist. In 
David v. Arroyo
: 
[170]




 Courts will decide cases, otherwise moot and academic, if: 
first
, there is a grave violation of the Constitution; 
second
, the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved;
 third
,
 when constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling 
principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and 
fourth
, the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.
[171]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Here, while the repealing Department Circulars may have modified 
or repealed portions of the assailed Department Circular, respondent 
Energy Regulatory Commission continues to assert that distribution 
utilities should be prohibited from participating in the contestable 
market, and that the migration of qualified end-users to the contestable
 market is mandatory.
[172]
 Clearly, there remains a continuing controversy which requires judicial resolution. 

 Both repealing Department Circulars were issued as a result of this 
Court's Temporary Restraining Order on the assailed issuances, to 
provide guidance to the affected end-users and suppliers.
[173]
 

 Department Circular No. DC2017-12-0013 allowed the voluntary 
participation or voluntary migration of end-users with a monthly average
 peak demands of 750 kW and above and 500 kW to 749 kW into the 
contestable market, as well as voluntary demand aggregation: 
  


 
Section 1. Voluntary Participation of Contestable Customers 
(CC) with Average Peak Demand of 750 kW and above in the Retail Market
.
 Upon the effectivity of this Circular, all CCs with a monthly average 
peak demand of 750 kW and above, for the preceding 12 months, may 
participate in the Retail Market. Participation in the Retail Market 
shall require a Retail Supply Contract (RSC) between a CC and Retail 
Electricity Supplier (RES) and registration of the RSC in the WESM. 


 
Section 2. Voluntary Participation of Contestable Customers with Average Peak Demand of 500 kW to 749 kW in the Retail Market
.
 By 26 June 2018 or on an earlier date specified by the ERC, all 
eligible electricity End-users to become CCs with a monthly average peak
 demand of 500 kW to 749 kW for the preceding 12 months may voluntarily 
participate in the Retail Market. 


 
Section 3. Voluntary Demand Aggregation
. By 26 December 
2018 or on an earlier date specified by the ERC, electricity End-users 
within a contiguous area whose aggregate average peak demand is not less
 than 500 kW for the preceding 12-month period may aggregate their 
demand to be part of the Contestable Market and may voluntarily enter 
into RSC with the Aggregators. Aggregators as defined in the EPIRA, 
refers to a person or entity, engaged in consolidating electric power 
demand of End-Users in the Contestable [M]arket, for the purpose of 
purchasing and reselling electricity on a group basis.
[174]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 The voluntary participation or migration of contestable customers 
to the contestable market in Department Circular No. DC2017-12-0013 is 
contrary to the directive of mandatory migration contained in the 
assailed issuances. Thus, its repealing clause
[175]
 abolished Sections 1 and 2 of the assailed Department Circular, which read: 
  


 
Section 1. Compliance to Full Contestability by Contestable Customers with Average Demand of One (1) MW and Above
. 


 All [Contestable Customers], which are currently being served by
 their franchised [Distribution Utilities], are mandated to secure their
 respective [Retail Supply Contracts] no later than 25 June 2016, with 
any of the following: 








(a)


Any licensed [Retail Electricity Supplier]; 






(b)


Any Generation Company, currently 
owning and operating power generation facilities, duly issued a 
Certificate of Compliance (COC) by the [Energy Regulatory Commission] 
and is offering to serve the power requirements of any [Contestable 
Customers]: 
Provided
, That it secures a license from [Energy Regulatory Commission]; 






(c)


Any Prospective Generation Company. 
As used in this Circular, a Prospective Generation Company shall refer 
to any Person or Entity that power generation project is undergoing 
construction or planned and has been included in the DOE's Power 
Development Plan (PDP); 








Any [Retail Supply Contract] that the [Contestable Customer] 
entered into with a Prospective Generation Company shall be deemed 
compliant with the Mandatory Contestability prescribed in this Circular;
  The [Contestable Customer] and its counterparty [Retail Electricity 
Supplier], Generation Company or Prospective Generation Company shall 
submit to [Department of Energy] and [Energy Regulatory Commission] 
their signed [Retail Supply Contract] for assessment, monitoring, policy
 and rule-making purposes particularly on the timelines and effectivity 
date of the [Retail Supply Contract]. 


 The [Department of Energy] and [Energy Regulatory Commission] 
shall recognize such compliance of the [Contestable Customers] to the 
Mandatory Contestability if any of the following conditions are met: 








(a)


The [Contestable Customer] has entered into an [Retail Supply Contract] with any existing [Retail Electricity Supplier];






 


 






(b)


The [Contestable Customer] has entered into an [Retail Supply Contract] with any Generation Company: 
Provided
,
 That the [Retail Supply Contract] shall be effective only upon the 
Generation Company's acquisition of a [Retail Electricity Supplier] 
license from the [Energy Regulatory Commission];






 


 






(c)


The [Contestable 
Customer] has entered into a Forward [Retail Service Contract] with a 
Prospective Generation Company, with the following conditions:






 


 


 








(i)


The effectivity date of the [Retail Supply Contract] has been clearly spelled out;






 


 


 








(ii)


The [Retail Supply Contract] shall 
indicate the commitment of the Prospective Generation Company to 
commence the commercial operations of its power project on or before the
 effectivity date of the [Retail Supply Contract];






 


 


 








(iii)


Notwithstanding any 
[Retail Supply Contract] signed by a [Contestable Customer] with a 
Prospective Generation Company, the concerned franchised [Distribution 
Utility] shall continue to serve the electricity requirements of the 
[Contestable Customer] until the [Retail Supply Contract] between the 
[Contestable Customer] and the Prospective Generation Company has become
 effective; and






 


 


 








(iv)


The Prospective Generation Company 
has secured its [Retail Electricity Supplier] license from the [Energy 
Regulatory Commission].




















Any Prospective Generation Company 
that fails to comply with the provisions of its Forward [Retail Supply 
Contract] with the [Contestable Customer] shall be imposed with fines 
and penalties, and an alternative [Retail Electricity Supplier] shall be
 appointed by the [Energy Regulatory Commission] to supply the affected 
[Contestable Customer], which shall be given a (sic) six (6) months to 
secure a new [Retail Electricity Supplier].








Section 2. Contestability of End-Users with Average Demand from 750 kW and Above. 








(a)


All [Contestable 
Customers] with an average demand ranging from 750 kW and 999 kW for the
 preceding 12-month period, are mandated to secure their [Retail Supply 
Contracts] with a [Retail Electricity Supplier] no later than 25 June 
2016;






 


 






(b)


Effective 26 June 2016, Aggregators 
shall be allowed to compete with [Retail Electricity Supplier], 
Generation Company and Prospective Generation Company;






 


 






(c)


 
In the case of retail aggregation, 
any [Contestable Customers] within a contiguous area may individually or
 collectively aggregate their electricity supply requirements to an 
Aggregator, duly licensed by the [Energy Regulatory Commission]. The 
aggregated demand shall in no case be lower than 750 kW.
















Aggregators, as defined in the EPIRA,
 refers to a person or entity, engaged in consolidating electric power 
demand of End-users in the contestable market, for the purpose of 
purchasing and reselling electricity on a group basis. The Aggregator 
may secure the same through a Competitive Supply Procurement (CSP) 
process to be prescribed by the [Energy Regulatory Commission] in a 
separate Issuance. 






 


 






(d)


To ensure timely implementation and 
continuity of the contestability in the Supply Sector, the [Energy 
Regulatory Commission] shall promulgate the applicable guidelines on 
retail aggregation.
[176]
 (Emphasis in the original) 










Department Circular No. DC2017-12-0014,
[177]

 in turn, modified the assailed Department Circular by repealing the 
prohibition on distribution utilities to supply electricity beyond its 
captive customers. Its Section 7
[178]
 repealed Section 5(h) of the assailed Circular, which had provided: 




 
Section 5. Licensing of Retail Electricity Suppliers. 
Pursuant
 to the EPIRA, any entity engaged in the distribution of electricity to 
End-users shall provide open and non-discriminatory access to its 
distribution system. To ensure compliance with this EPIRA provision, and
 that all players are afforded a level playing field, the DOE is 
cognizant that [the Energy Regulatory Commission] is in the process of 
reviewing its guidelines, taking into account the following: 


 . . . .


 (h) Prohibiting [Distribution Utilities] to engage in the Supply Business beyond its Captive Customers: 
Provided
,
 That the existing Local [Retail Electricity Suppliers] after the 
effectivity of this Circular may continue to perform its Local [Retail 
Electricity Supplier] function until expiration of its [Retail Supply 
Contracts] entered into with [Contestable Customers] as of the 
effectivity of this Circular.
[179]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 In contrast, Department Circular No. DC2017-12-0014 allowed 
distribution utilities to supply contestable customers within its 
franchise area: 




 
Section 4. Distribution Utilities as Local RES. 
Distribution
 Utilities (DU) may provide electricity services to [Contestable 
Customers] within its franchise area as a Local [Retail Electricity 
Supplier], upon authorization from the [Energy Regulatory Commission]; 
Provided, that the [Distribution Utility] shall comply with the 
unbundling provisions of the RA 9136 and Rule 10 of the rules and 
regulations to implement Republic Act No. 9136.
[180]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 Its Section 2 also included an affiliate of a distribution utility
 among the possible electricity suppliers that may enter into a retail 
supply contract with a contestable customer. Affiliates were not 
previously included in the now repealed Section 1 of Department Circular
 No. DC2015-06-0010. Section 2 of Department Circular No. DC2017-12-0014
 reads: 
  


 
Section 2. Licensing of Retail Electricity Suppliers. 
Subject
 to the qualifications set by the [Energy Regulatory Commission] in 
accordance with the EPIRA and its implementing rules, any of the 
following entities may be considered to become a [Retail Electricity 
Supplier]: 


 A Generation Company or Affiliate thereof; 
An Affiliate of a Distribution Utility;
Retail Aggregators;
 An [Independent Power Producer] Administrator; and
Any Prospective Generation Company. A Prospective Generation 
Company shall refer to any person or entity which has a power generation
 project that is undergoing construction or that is planned to be 
constructed which project is included in the [Department of Energy's] 
Power Development Plan (PDP) as committed power project; 
Any other Person authorized by the [Energy Regulatory 
Commission] to engage in the selling, brokering or marketing of 
electricity to the Contestable Market, consistent with the EPIRA and its
 implementing rules and regulations. 


 In order to serve the Contestable Customers, individually or as 
an aggregate demand, these entities shall secure a [Retail Electricity 
Supplier] license from the [Energy Regulatory Commission]. 


 Consistent with the EPIRA and implementing rules and regulations
 and subject to further qualifications of the [Energy Regulatory 
Commission], any other persons authorized by the [Energy Regulatory 
Commission] to engage in the selling, brokering or marketing of 
electricity to the Contestable Customer shall likewise secure a license 
as [Retail Electricity Supplier].
[181]




 With the assailed Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0010 having 
been repealed, the assailed Energy Regulatory Commission Resolutions, 
which were regulatory guidelines to the Department Circular, have become
 bereft of legal basis. As respondent Department of Energy admits: 
  


 23. 	With the rectification by the DOE of its RCOA policies 
primarily those that 	are contained in DOE DC2015-06-0010, the 
regulatory guidelines anchored and issued in accordance thereof, now 
stand without legal basis. 	Under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7638 
(otherwise known as the Department of Energy Act of 1992) the 
responsibility and authority to "prepare, integrate, coordinate, 
supervise and control 		all plans, programs[,] 	projects, 	and 
activities of the Government relative to energy exploration, 
development, utilization, distribution and conservation" is vested with 
the DOE.
[182]
 




 When the EPIRA became effective on June 26, 2001, it sought "to 
provide a framework for the restructuring of the electric power 
industry"
[183]
 to attain its 
underlying objective of creating a free and competitive market that will
 provide reliable electricity at reasonable prices.
[184]
 
 The EPIRA then gave respondent Department of Energy the power "to supervise the restructuring of the electricity industry"
[185]
 and amended Republic Act No. 7638 to reflect the Department's new powers and functions. 

 The EPIRA abolished the Energy Regulatory Board and created respondent 
Energy Regulatory Commission, a quasi-judicial and independent 
regulatory body, in its stead.
[186]

 Respondent Energy Regulatory Commission was then tasked with promoting 
competition, encouraging market development, ensuring customer choice, 
and penalizing abuse of market power in the restructured electricity 
industry.
[187]
 Both 
respondents possess similar mandates in that they are the administrative
 agencies tasked with supervising and overseeing the energy sector. 
However, in differentiating their functions, 
Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas v. Energy Regulatory Commission
[188]

 explained that respondent Department of Energy formulates the rules and
 regulations to implement the EPIRA. Respondent Energy Regulatory 
Commission then enforces these rules and regulations.
[189]
 
Alyansa

 stressed that respondent Energy Regulatory Commission "has no 
independence or discretion to ignore, waive, amend, postpone, or revoke 
the rules and regulations of the DOE pursuant to the EPIRA."
[190]
 
 
Alyansa
 likewise expounded on the complementary functions of respondents under the EPIRA: 
  


 Under the EPIRA, it is the DOE that issues the rules and 
regulations to implement the EPIRA, including the implementation of the 
policy objectives stated in Section 2 of the EPIRA. Rules and 
regulations include circulars that have the force and effect of rules or
 regulations. Thus, pursuant to its powers and functions under the 
EPIRA, the DOE issued the 2015 DOE Circular mandating the conduct of 
CSP. 


 The 2015 DOE Circular, as stated in its very provisions, was 
issued pursuant to the DOE's power to "formulate such rules and 
regulations as may be necessary to implement the objectives of the 
EPIRA," where the State policy is to "[p]rotect the public interest as 
it is affected by the rates and services of electric utilities and other
 providers of electric power." Under the EPIRA, it is also the State 
policy to "ensure the x x x affordability of the supply of electric 
power." The purpose of the 2015 DOE Circular is to implement the State 
policies prescribed in the EPIRA. Clearly, the 2015 DOE Circular 
constitutes a rule or regulation issued by the DOE pursuant to its 
rule-making power under Section 37(p) of the EPIRA. 


 The EPIRA also provides for the powers and functions of the ERC.
 Section 43 of the EPIRA mandates that the ERC "shall be responsible for
 the following key functions in the restructured industry:" 








(a)


Enforce the implementing rules and regulations of this Act. 






. . . . 






 


 






(o)


Monitor the activities in the 
generation and supply of the electric power industry with the end in 
view of promoting free market competition and ensuring that the 
allocation or pass through of bulk purchase cost by distributors is 
transparent, non-discriminatory and that any existing subsidies shall be
 divided pro-rata among all retail suppliers;






. . . . 








Thus, the very first mandate of the ERC under its charter, the 
EPIRA, is to "[e]nforce the implementing rules and regulations" of the 
EPIRA as formulated and adopted by DOE. Clearly, under the EPIRA, it is 
the DOE that formulates the policies, and issues the rules and 
regulations, to implement the EPIRA. The function of the ERC is to 
enforce and implement the policies formulated, as well as the rules and 
regulations issued, by the DOE. The ERC has no power whatsoever to amend
 the implementing rules and regulations of the EPIRA as issued by the 
DOE. The ERC is further mandated under EPIRA to ensure that the "pass 
through of bulk purchase cost by distributors is transparent [and] 
non-discriminatory[.]"
[191]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Clearly, then, respondent Department of Energy, with its mandate 
of supervising the restructuring of the electricity industry, is the 
agency tasked with formulating rules and regulations to give life to 
EPIRA's policy objectives. Respondent Energy Regulatory Commission, for 
its part, is tasked with implementing the rules and regulations 
formulated and issued by respondent Department of Energy. It cannot 
supplant respondent Department of Energy's policies, rules, and 
regulations with its own issuances.
[192]
 

 Finally, with the promulgation of Department Circular Nos. 
DC2017-12-0013 and DC2017-12-0014, which abolished the assailed 
issuances, respondent Energy Regulatory Commission is duty bound to 
provide regulatory support
[193]

 by issuing the appropriate guidelines pursuant to its mandate under the
 EPIRA to "'[e]nforce the implementing rules and regulations' of the 
EPIRA as formulated and adopted by [respondent Department of Energy]."
[194]

 Section 2. Supply Contract and Customer Switching. Regardless of
 the contract period of the RSC entered into by a CC and its RES, such 
RSC shall provide "Customer Switching" provision whereby the CC shall be
 allowed to terminate its RSC with its incumbent RES should there be a 
competitive supply contract package that is more responsive to the needs
 of the CC. The incumbent RES shall have the right to retain the RSC 
provided that it can match the superior offer to the CC.


 Notwithstanding and consistent with Section 8 of DOE Circular 
No. DC2012-11-0010, the initial switch of a CC to its new Supplier shall
 only be allowed six (6) months after the full RCOA Commercial Operation
 Date. The actual switching shall be based on a considerable period of 
time as may be determined by the RES and the CC, but should not exceed 
the applicable notification requirement by the CRB, as provided in the 
same DOE Circular.


 Towards this end, the ERC shall provide the necessary guidelines
 in determining competitiveness of an RSC. The competitiveness of a 
supply contract package may include determination on among other things,
 price, quality of power, and value added services.

transmission and generation rates and the rates shall reflect the 
respective costs of providing each service. Inter-grid and intra-grid 
cross subsidies for both the transmission and generation rates shall be 
removed in accordance with this Act.


 Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, each 
distribution utility shall file its revised rates for the approval by 
the ERC. The distribution wheeling charges shall be unbundled from the 
retail rate and the rates shall reflect the respective costs of 
providing each service. For both the distribution retail wheeling and 
supplier's charges, inter-class subsidies shall be removed in accordance
 with this Act. Within six (6) months from the date of submission of 
revised rates by NPC and each distribution utility, the ERC shall notify
 the entities of their approval.

 DOE Department of Energy Circular No. DC2012-05-0005 (2012), sec. 10 provides:
  


 Section 10. Supplier of Last Resort. The franchised DU shall act
 as the Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR) in instances of Last Resort 
Supply Event. To cover the requirement of the Last Resort Supply Event, 
the DU-SOLR shall source electricity to be supplied to the CC through 
WESM or any available supply in the market. 




 
[159]
 DOE Department of Energy Circular No. DC2012-11-0010 (2012), sec. 11 provides:
  


 Section 11. Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR). In the event that 
the Supplier is not able to perform its obligations to its Contestable 
Customers consistent with this Circular, the franchised DU shall act as 
the SOLR in the Last Resort Supply Event as defined in this Circular. 
However, should (sic) the franchised DU is deemed not capable to perform
 the SOLR service, the ERC, prior to the full RCOA Commercial Operation 
Date, shall designate another DU which will perform the SOLR function 
for the affected Contestable Customers. The SOLR may source electricity 
to be supplied to the Contestable Customers through the WESM or any 
available source of energy supply. The SOLR shall be allowed to recover 
their costs attributable to its SOLR services.


 Notwithstanding, the ERC shall design a mechanism to prevent the
 occurrence of a Last Resort Supply Event, which may include, among 
others, adequate due diligence on the technical and financial 
capability, and other parameters used in the issuance of Supplier 
License. The CRB, on the other hand, shall issue timely notification of 
Suppliers' compliance with the prudential requirement pursuant to the 
WESM Rules.

applicable rules and regulations, a CC may source its electricity supply
 requirements from ERC-licensed RES, ERC-authorized Local RES; and, on 
its option, directly through the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market 
(WESM). Further, a CC shall be allowed to enter into a Retail Supply 
Contract (RSC) with a prospective Generation Company; provided, that the
 Generation Company is issued a Certificate of Compliance (COC) by the 
ERC and successfully registered as a Trading Participant in the WESM; 
and provided, further, that before the effective date of the RSC, the 
Generating Company shall have secured a Supplier's license from the ERC.
