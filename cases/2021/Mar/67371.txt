TITO S. SARION, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.


D E C I S I O N




GAERLAN, J.:


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
certiorari
[1]

 filed by petitioner Tito S. Sarion (petitioner) under Rule 45 of the 
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to annul and set aside the 
Decision
[2]
 dated September 29, 2017 and Resolution
[3]

 dated November 8, 2018 of the Sandiganbayan in SB-11-CRM-0256 to 0257. 
The assailed rulings adjudged the petitioner guilty of violating Section
 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as 
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act; and Malversation of Public 
Funds or Property under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
 
The Antecedent Facts


 The instant controversy arose from a 
Contract Agreement
[4]

 entered into on December 29, 2003 by herein petitioner, in his capacity
 as Municipal Mayor for the Municipal Government of Daet, Camarines 
Norte, and Billy Aceron (Aceron), General Manager of Markbilt 
Construction (Markbilt), represented by his attorney-in-fact, Architect 
Romeo B. Itturalde. The agreement had for its purpose the Phase II 
construction of the Daet Public Market for the amount of P71,499,875.29,
 which must be completed within a period of 365 calendar days.
[5]
 On January 5, 2005, the petitioner approved a 
Notice to Commence Work
[6] 
authorizing Markbilt to commence with the construction project on the 10
th
 day from receipt of the said Notice. Thereafter, construction works proceeded.
[7]
 

 Meanwhile, the petitioner's term ended and Elmer E. Panotes (Mayor 
Panotes) was elected as Municipal Mayor of Daet, Camarines Norte, during
 the May 2004 national and local elections.
[8]
 

 On December 4, 2005 Markbilt, through its engineer Carlito A. Torero, 
wrote a letter to Mayor Panotes, requesting the verification and proper 
evaluation of therein attached monthly computation of variation in the 
prices of materials.
[9]
 
 The construction of the Daet Public Market was completed sometime in 2006.
[10]
 

 On November 13, 2006, the Office of Mayor Panotes received a letter 
from Markbilt, requesting the processing and payment of contract price 
escalation in the amount of P5,222,903.75, in relation to the Daet 
Public Market (Phase II) project. Mayor Panotes, refused to act on the 
demand.
[11]
 During the local elections held in 2007, the petitioner was re-elected as Mayor of the Municipality of Daet.
[12]
 

 On January 21, 2008, in a letter addressed to the petitioner, Markbilt 
reiterated its request for payment of the contract price escalation. A 
similar demand was made by Markbilt in a letter dated February 7, 2008, 
this time with the information that it will impose 15% interest 
per annum
 on their claim.
[13]

 With this, the petitioner instructed Municipal Administrator Elmer 
Nagera (Administrator Nagera) to look for sources of fund to satisfy 
Markbilt's claim. This gave rise to the creation of Supplemental Budget 
No. 1. After the same was signed by Municipal Budget Officer Amelia P. 
Laborte (Budget Officer Laborte) and approved by Administrator Nagera, 
by authority of the petitioner, Supplemental Budget No. 1 was submitted 
to the Sangguniang Bayan.
[14]


 On March 6, 2008, the Sangguniang Bayan passed Resolution No. 063
[15]

 unanimously approving Supplemental Budget No. 1-2008 and appropriating 
the amount of P11,222,088.00 of the municipality's internal revenue 
allotment; of such amount, designated under the Special Account, 
P4,400,000.00 was allotted for the 
Construction of Market
.
[16]
 Resolution No. 063 was later approved by the petitioner.
[17]


 In another letter dated April 14, 2008, Markbilt reiterated its demand for payment of contract price escalation.
[18]

 After Budget Officer Laborte certified the existence of available 
appropriation, Administrator Nagera prepared Obligation Request No. 
100-08-03-402 certifying that "the charges to appropriation/allotment 
are necessary, lawful and under his direct supervision" and that "the 
supporting documents are valid, proper and legal."
[19]

 Subsequently, administrator Nagera issued Disbursement Voucher No. 
08041239 in the amount of P1,000,000.00, payable to Markbilt, m partial 
satisfaction of its demand for price escalation.
[20]

 Concerned with the applicability of R.A. No. 9184, Municipal Accountant
 Caroline Maisie Robles (Accountant Robles) consulted the Commission on 
Audit Auditor assigned to the municipality, who in turn, advised him to 
seek the opinion of the Municipal Legal Officer.
[21]
 

 In his opinion, Municipal Legal Officer Edmundo Deveza II (Legal 
Officer Deveza) found, on the basis of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 
1594, that there was no reason to refuse the payment of obligation in 
favor of Markbilt.
[22]
 Thus, 
on April 21, 2008, Accountant Robles certified the supporting documents 
complete and the allotment for partial payment of Markbilt. After 
Municipal Treasurer Arlyn O. Aberia certified that funds were available,
 the petitioner approved the release of the funds for payment.
[23]
 

 On April 24, 2008, Markbilt received payment of P1,000,000.00 made 
through Landbank Check No. 0272388, and evidenced by Official Receipt 
No. 1156 dated April 24, 2008.
[24]

 On June 17, 2008, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Camarines Norte 
approved Resolution No. 229-2008 declaring as operative Supplemental 
Budget No. 1-2008 of the Municipality of Daet.
[25]
 On November 27, 2008, Zenaida Baluca, a resident of Daet, Camarines Norte, filed a Complaint
[26]

 against the petitioner before the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon 
(Omb-Luzon). The complainant charged the petitioner for violation of 
Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 relative to the payment of price 
escalation in the Daet Public Market (Phase II) Project. 
 After 
investigation, Graft Investigation and Prosecution officer Judy Anne 
Doctor-Escalona found merit in the complaint and charged the petitioner 
with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, as amended and 
Malversation, in two separate Informations, the accusatory portions of 
which read: 
  
 SB-11-CRM-0256




 That on 24 April 2008 or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, 
in Daet, a first class municipality in the Province of Camarines Norte, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
accused, Tito S. Sarion, a public officer, being the Mayor of the 
Municipality of Daet, committing the crime in the discharge of his 
official functions, through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or 
gross inexcusable negligence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, 
and criminally cause undue injury to the government in the gross amount 
of One Million Pesos, Philippine Currency 	(PhP1,000,000.00),	by 	then 	
and 	there 	approving 	the disbursement in the absence of certificate of
 availability of funds, of public funds in said gross amount in favor of
 Markbilt Construction, the contractor for the construction of Daet 
Public Market (Phase II), as partial payment for its claim for price 
escalation which it is not entitled to so receive but which it received 
nevertheless per its Official Receipt No. 1156 dated 24 April 2008 
through the approval of the disbursement voucher by the accused even 
without the approval from the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB)
 and the determination by the National Economic Development Authority 
(NEDA) as to the propriety of the claim for price escalation in 
violation of the GPPB Guidelines for Contract price Escalation to the 
prejudice of the Municipality of Daet in said amount. 


 CONTRARY TO LAW.

 SB-11-CRM-0257




 That on 24 April 2008, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, 
in Daet, a first class municipality in the Province of Camarines Norte, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
accused, Tito S. Sarion, a public officer, being the Mayor of the 
Municipality of Daet, while in the performance of his official 
functions, committing the offense in relation to his office, and taking
 advantage of his official position, and in grave abuse thereof, having 
control of public funds in the gross amount of One Million Pesos, 
Philippine Currency (PhP1,000,000.00), which was placed under his 
administration by reason of the duties of his office, and is accountable
 for said amount of public funds pursuant to Section 340 of the Local 
Government Code, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously consent, or through abandonment or negligence, permit 
Markbilt Construction, the contractor for the construction of Daet 
Public Market (Phase II), to take such amount of public funds which it 
is not entitled to receive but which it received nevertheless per its 
Official Receipt No. 1156 dated 24 April 2008, by then and there 
allowing the disbursement through his approval of the disbursement 
voucher even in the absence of certificate of availability of funds in 
said gross amount in favor of Markbilt Construction as partial payment 
for its claim for the price escalation even without the approval from 
the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) and the determination by 
the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) as to the propriety 
of the claim for price escalation in violation of the GPPB Guidelines 
for Contract price Escalation. 


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[28]




 The petitioner was conditionally arraigned on September 2, 2011, and assisted by counsel, entered a plea of "not guilty."
[29]
 
 After trial, the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan rendered the herein assailed Decision
[30]
 on September 29, 2017, the dispositive portion of which reads: 
  


 WHEREFORE, this Court finds accused TITO SARION: 






1.


Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, and he is accordingly sentenced to:






 


 


 








a.


Suffer an indeterminate 
penalty of imprisonment of Six (6) years and One (1) month, as minimum, 
to Eight (8) years, as maximum, and,






 


 


 








b.


Suffer the penalty of perpetual special disqualification from holding public office; and, 






 


 






2.


Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
Malversation of Public Funds or Property
 under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is accordingly sentenced to:






 


 


 








a)

prision correccional
, as minimum, to Six (6) years and One (1) day of

b)


 
Pay a fine in the amount of One Million pesos (PhP1,000,000.00); and,






 


 


 








c)


 
Suffer the penalty of perpetual special disqualification from holding public office. 






Accused Sarion shall indemnify the Municipality of Daet the 
amount of One Million Pesos (PhP1,000,000.00) as actual damages, plus 
interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be reckoned from the date of 
finality of the Decision until its full satisfaction. 


 SO ORDERED.
[31]
 




 Foremost, the Sandiganbayan found that the prosecution was able to
 establish the elements of Malversation. Mainly, it held that the 
petitioner erred in approving Disbursement Voucher No. 08041239 which 
facilitated the partial payment of contract price escalation in favor of
 Markbilt although the latter is not entitled to be compensated. The 
Sandiganbayan ruled that the certificates attesting to the availability 
of funds and appropriation issued by the municipal officials were 
irregular and that Appropriation Ordinance No. 1 did not allocate funds 
for the payment of contract price escalation.
[32]
 

 Furthermore, the Sandiganbayan made it clear that under Section 81 of 
R.A. No. 9184, contract price escalation during the implementation of 
the contract is expressly prohibited except under extraordinary 
circumstances as determined by the National Economic Development 
Authority (NEDA) and upon prior approval of the Government Procurement 
Policy Board (GPPB).
[33]
 In 
this case, the Sandiganbayan noted that no such determination and 
approval were obtained prior to the approval of payment and release of 
the funds to Markbilt.
[34]
 The
 petitioner's act of authorizing the release of partial payment to 
Markbilt without personally confirming compliance with supporting 
documents is tantamount to gross negligence which subjects him to 
liability for the crime of Malversation of Public Funds.
[35]
 

 With respect to violation of Section 3(e) of RA. No. 3019, the 
Sandiganbayan equally found the petitioner guilty of the offense. It 
held that the same act of approving the release without complying with 
the provisions of RA. No. 9184, constitute gross inexcusable negligence;
 whereas the payment of contract price escalation in the amount of 
P1,000,000.00 is an unwarranted benefit in favor of Markbilt and, 
correspondingly the amount of undue injury caused to the Municipality of
 Daet.
[36]
 The petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied by the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution
[37]
 dated November 8, 2018, 
viz
.: 
  


 WHEREFORE, accused Tito S. Sarion's 
Motion for Reconsideration Re: Decision dated September 29, 2017
 is DENIED for lack of merit. 


 SO ORDERED.
[38]
 




 Thus, this petition for review on 
certiorari 
whereby the petitioner raises the following arguments in support thereof: 
  






1.


The Sandiganbayan seriously
 erred in convicting him of Malversation of Public Funds under Article 
217 of the Revised Penal Code when not all the elements thereof were 
proved by the plaintiff, through prosecution, beyond reasonable doubt. 














2.


The Sandiganbayan seriously erred in 
convicting him of Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 
when not all the elements thereof were proved by the plaintiff, through 
the prosecution, beyond reasonable doubt.
[39]
 






Ruling of the Court




 The petition is 
not meritorious.
 
 Petitioner,
 in this appeal, alleges that the Sandiganbayan erred in convicting him 
of the crime of Malversation under Article 217 of the RPC, and for 
violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, submitting that not all the 
elements thereof have been proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable 
doubt. 
 On this score, it is imperative to point out at the outset that this appeal is in the nature of a petition for review on 
certiorari
.
 In the exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction over the decision
 of the Sandiganbayan, it is settled that this mode of review is limited
 only to questions of law. The factual findings of the Sandiganbayan 
are, as a general rule, conclusive upon the Court.
[40]

 The difference between a question of law and a question of fact has 
been settled. A question of law exists when there is doubt or 
controversy as to what the law is on a certain set of facts. In 
contrast, what is involved is a question of fact when the resolution of 
the same demands the calibration of evidence, the determination of the 
credibility of witnesses, the existence and the relevance of the 
attendant circumstances, and the probability of specific situations.
[41]

 Thus, the issues of "whether the prosecution's evidence proved the 
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, whether the presumption of
 innocence was properly accorded the accused, x x x or whether the 
defense of good faith was correctly appreciated," submitted herein by 
the petitioner, are all, albeit in varying degrees, questions of fact.
[42]
 

 The petitioner, in arguing the absence of elements of the crimes with 
which he is charged, in effect seeks a re-evaluation of the 
Sandiganbayan's appreciation of the sufficiency of evidence presented. 
The general rule is that these factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are
 conclusive upon the Court, save for certain exceptions, 
viz
.: 
  


 (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on 
speculations, surmise[s], and conjectures; (2) the inference made is 
manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the 
judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and [(5)] the findings of
 fact of the Sandiganbayan are premised on the absence of evidence and 
are contradicted by evidence on record.
[43]
 




 None of these exceptions obtains in this case. Thus, there is no 
reason to deviate from the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan. 

 With respect to the crime of malversation, the petitioner posits that 
he cannot be convicted of the offense as the elements of official 
custody of funds and accountability therefor, and the act of 
misappropriation are missing.
[44]
 

 He claims that contrary to the findings of the Sandiganbayan, there 
were prior certifications for availability of funds before he signed the
 disbursement voucher. These certifications were not irregular as 
Supplemental Budget No. 1, which was approved by the Sangguniang Bayan, 
provided for appropriation in the amount of P1,000,000.00 in favor of 
Markbilt.
[45]
 Petitioner asserts that he has no custody or control over such amount paid to Markbilt.
[46]
 

 Moreover, petitioner argues that the responsibility of ensuring that 
the requirements of Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184 are met does not belong 
to him but to Markbilt. At any rate, even claiming such responsibility, 
petitioner suggests that failure to comply with the said requirements 
should not be penalized as the law does not provide any penal sanctions.
[47]
 

 Finally, petitioner submits that he had the right to rely upon the 
legal opinion of the Municipal Legal Officer, which is presumed regular;
 and that he acted in good faith, a valid defense in malversation as it 
indicates the absence of criminal intent.
[48]

 The elements common to all acts of malversation under Article 217 of 
the Revised Penal Code, as amended, are the following: (a) that the 
offender is a public officer; (b) that he had custody or control of 
funds or property by reason of the duties of his office; (c) that those 
funds or property were public funds or property for which he was 
accountable; and (d) that he appropriated, took, misappropriated or 
consented, or through abandonment or negligence, permitted another 
person to take them.
[49]
 

 Applied in this case, it is undisputed that the petitioner is a public 
officer, being then elected Municipal Mayor of Daet and that the funds 
involved are public in character, as they belong to the Municipality of 
Daet. 
 Contrary to his allegation, petitioner is by reason of his
 office, an accountable officer. Section 340 of the Local Government 
Code (LGC) provides: 
  


 Section 340. Persons Accountable for Local Government Funds. - 
Any officer of the local government unit whose duty permits or requires 
the possession or custody of local government funds shall be accountable
 and responsible for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with the 
provisions of this title. Other local officials, though not accountable 
by the nature of their duties, may likewise be similarly held 
accountable and responsible for local government funds through their 
participation in the use or application thereof. 




 Based on the foregoing provision, local government officials are 
accountable public officers either because of the nature of their 
functions, or on account of their participation in the use or 
application of public funds. In this case, the funds paid to Markbilt 
form part of the internal revenue allotment of the Municipality of Daet 
and are by virtue thereof, "under the collective custody of the 
municipal officials who had to act together to disburse the funds for 
their intended municipal use."
[50]
 Consequently, they are public funds for which the petitioner as Municipal Mayor is accountable.
[51]

 More unequivocal, Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 or the Government
 Auditing Code of the Philippines states that municipal mayors are 
immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and 
property pertaining to their municipality.
[52]
  As a required standard procedure,
[53]

 and evidently from petitioner's own narration, any disbursement or 
release of funds requires his approval as Mayor. In this case, payment 
in favor of Markbilt was released only after petitioner's signature in 
the disbursement voucher and the corresponding Landbank check. This 
signifies that petitioner, in his capacity as Municipal Mayor, had 
control and responsibility over the subject funds
[54]
 and thus satisfies the second and third elements of the offense. 

 Finally, on the last element, the Court agrees with the Sandiganbayan 
that the petitioner, through gross inexcusable negligence, permitted 
Markbilt to receive partial payment of price escalation despite not 
being entitled thereto. A disbursement voucher "shows on what account or
 by what authority a particular payment has been made, or that services 
have been performed which entitle the party to whom it is issued to 
payment."
[55]
 Thus, when 
petitioner signed the disbursement voucher in favor of Markbilt, in 
effect, he certified to the correctness of the entries therein; and 
warranted that the expenses incurred were necessary and lawful, the 
supporting documents were complete, and the availability of cash 
therefor.
[56]
 By approving the
 disbursement voucher and signing the Landbank check payable to 
Markbilt, despite the absence of funding and failure to comply with the 
requirements of Section 61, R.A. No. 9184, he permitted Markbilt to 
receive public funds to which it is not entitled. Otherwise, the 
petitioner's approval and signature in respect facilitated the illegal 
release of funds, constitutive of the act of malversation. 
 Malversation may be committed intentionally (
dolo
) or by means of negligence (
culpa
). The crime is committed by means of 
dolo

 when the act is accompanied by criminal intent as when the offender 
misappropriated or converted public funds of property to one's personal 
use.
[57]
 Malversation may also be committed by means of 
culpa
 or by such negligence or indifference to duty or to consequences as, in law is equivalent to criminal intent;
[58]
 as when the offender knowingly allowed another or others to make use of or misappropriate public funds or property.
[59]
 

 It is a basic principle that no contract involving the expenditure of 
public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation 
therefor which is sufficient to cover the proposed expenditure.
[60]

 Correspondingly, no revenue funds shall be paid out of the public 
treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation law or specific 
statutory authority.
[61]
 The 
act of petitioner in approving Disbursement voucher No. 08041239 and 
signing Landbank check No. 0272388 in violation of the said elementary 
principles is a flagrant and palpable breach of duty tantamount to gross
 negligence.
[62]
 
 In 
this case, as correctly ruled by the Sandiganbayan, the payment of price
 escalation is not supported by an appropriation. Pursuant to the 
Contract Agreement
[63]

 dated December 29, 2003, relative to the Phase II construction of the 
Daet Public Market, petitioner and Markbilt agreed for the construction 
to completed within a period of 365 calendar days for the amount of 
P71,499,875.29. The statement of such amount constitutes the specific 
appropriation required by law for a specific expenditure, that is, the 
entirety of the Daet Public Market (Phase II) construction project. 
 The basis of Markbilt's claim for price escalation is based on the same contract, particularly, clause no. 4, which states: 
  


 4. The Implementing Rules and Guidelines regarding Adjustment of
 contract prices adopted and approved by the Government will be applied 
in this contract.
[64]




 The provision authorizes the claim for price escalation, without 
any reference as to the source of funds for its satisfaction. To the 
Court, it is a vague recognition of Markbilt's right to collect over and
 beyond the contract price. A cursory reading thereof shows that it does
 not provide additional rights in favor of Markbilt. It merely mentions 
what is evident and otherwise impliedly included in the contract, 
i.e.
,
 that pertinent laws and rules apply in the event of the need to adjust 
contract price arises. As the Court sees it, the invocation of this 
clause in the 
Contract Agreement
 is a vain attempt to circumvent the requirement that there be a specific appropriation for any disbursement. 

 What is crucial is that in the absence of appropriation or designation 
of source of funds, the aforestated clause cannot be considered as a 
source of an enforceable right in favor of Markbilt. Section 85 in 
relation to Section 86 of P.D. No. 1445, requires the existence of a 
prior sufficient appropriation, as certified by the proper accounting 
official, before any contract for expenditure of public funds is 
authorized, 
viz.
: 
  


 Section 85. Appropriation before entering into contract. 




 (1) No contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall 
be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor, the 
unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is sufficient to
 cover the proposed expenditure. 


 x x x x


 
Section 86. Certificate showing appropriation to meet contract.

 Except in the case of a contract for personal service, for supplies for
 current consumption or to be carried in stock not exceeding the 
estimated consumption for three months, or banking transactions of 
governmentÂ­ owned or controlled banks, 
no contract involving the 
expenditure of public funds by any government agency shall be entered 
into or authorized unless the proper accounting official of the agency 
concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the 
obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for that the amount 
necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current fiscal year is 
available for expenditure on account thereof,
 subject to verification by the auditor concerned. 
The
 certificate, signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor 
who verified it, shall be attached to and become an integral part of the
 proposed contract,
 and the sum so certified shall not thereafter be
 available for expenditure for any other purpose until the obligation of
 the government agency concerned under the contract is fully 
extinguished. (Underscoring supplied) 




 The only appropriation in this case is the original contract price
 of P71,499,875.29. Consequently, no payment can be made beyond such 
amount. In the same way, as there is no funding to support the price 
escalation clause in the said 
Contract Agreement
, no public funds can be disbursed in payment thereof. The clause is void and of no effect.
[65]

 It cannot be enforced and the public officer who entered into the 
contract without such appropriation and certification shall be liable 
for any resulting damage to the government.
[66]

 For the sake of argument, even assuming the validity of the contract 
clause authorizing price escalation, the Court nonetheless finds that 
the additional budget certified and approved does not provide for 
payment of price escalation in favor of Markbilt. 
 Petitioner 
argues that Supplemental Budget No. 1 signed by the Municipal Budget 
Officer Laborte and approved by Municipal Administrator Nagera, on his 
authority, and of the Sangguniang Bayan, provided for appropriation m 
the amount of P1M in favor of Markbilt Construction.

 Appropriation Ordinance No. 1 passed by the Sangguniang Bayan on March 
6, 2008, which approved Supplemental Budget No. 1, provides:

The Municipal Treasurer, Municipal

SECTION 3.
 This appropriation ordinance shall take effect upon approval.
[68]




 Contrary to the submission of the petitioner, a cursory reading of
 the appropriation ordinance clearly shows that it does not cover the 
payment for price escalation. Understood by its plain and ordinary 
meaning,
[69]
 the supplemental 
budget refers to the further construction of the Daet public market. It 
pertains to future works to be done, and not of past work performed. Had
 it been the intention of the Sangguniang Bayan to pay for the price 
escalation on completed works, it could have employed a more direct 
language than that employed, such as "works done." In the absence of 
evidence showing legislative intent of the Sangguniang Bayan to the 
contrary, the Court cannot stretch the meaning of the law. An 
appropriation may be used only for the specific purpose for which they 
are appropriated.
[70]
 The Court quotes with approval the Sandiganbayan's elucidation: 
  


 Appropriation Ordinance No. 1 contained no appropriation for the
 payment of the amount of Php1,000,000.00 to Markbilt. Appropriation 
Ordinance No. 1 shows that the appropriation was for the construction of
 the public market. There was no appropriation to pay for the contract 
price escalation, an obligation supposedly incurred in the already 
completed construction of the Daet Public Market. 


 Accused Sarion and his witnesses point to the deliberations of 
the Sangguniang Bayan. But the intent to pay the alleged contract price 
escalation allegedly manifested during the deliberations are not 
reflected in Appropriation Ordinance No. 1. Notably, no documentary 
evidence was offered to prove the alleged deliberations.
[71]




 In the herein assailed ruling of the Sandiganbayan, it held that 
despite the issue with respect to funding, the petitioner cannot be held
 culpable as "the Information alleges the absence of, not the infirmity 
in, the certificate of availability of funds."
[72]
 The Court does not agree. 
  
 An Information is sufficient when it states the designation of
 the offense and the acts or omissions which constitute the offense 
charged. The crime must be described in ordinary and concise language 
and with such particularity and reasonable certainty that the accused is
 duly informed of the offense charged and able to adequately prepare for
 his defense.
[73] 
"In 
particular, whether an Information validly charges an offense depends on
 whether the material facts alleged in the complaint or information 
shall establish the essential elements of the offense charged as defined
 in the law."
[74]


 To recapitulate, Section 86 of P.D. No. 1445 requires the 
existence of a prior specific appropriation, as certified by the proper 
accounting official, before any contract for expenditure of public funds
 is authorized. In this sense, therefore, it is the absence of 
certification as to the availability of or source of funds 
pertaining specifically to the payment of price escalation
,
 that rendered the clause void and the subsequent approval by the 
petitioner of the disbursement voucher invalid. It is this irregularity 
which rendered the payment in favor of Markbilt illegal. In tum, it is 
the transgression of the same basic principle in disbursement of public 
funds which translates to gross negligence on the part of the 
petitioner. With this, the elements of the offense sufficiently alleged 
and proven in the Information, there is no obstacle in convicting the 
petitioner of the crime of malversation. 
 At any rate, granting 
for the sake of argument that the failure of the Information to 
specifically employ the word "irregularity" instead of "absence" 
constitutes a violation of the petitioner's right to Information and as 
such may not be considered in determining the offenses charged, the 
petitioner may nonetheless be still be convicted of the crime of 
malversation and for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 "through
 [his] approval of the disbursement voucher x x x even without the 
approval from the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) and the 
determination by the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) as 
to the propriety of the claim for price escalation in violation of the 
GPPB Guidelines for Contract price Escalation,"
[75]

 clearly stated and alleged in the two (2) Informations filed against 
him. As will further be illustrated hereunder, this fact establishes the
 elements of the subject offenses as defined by law. 
 As 
correctly ruled by the Sandiganbayan, in addition to the requirement of 
appropriation and certification of availability of funds, price 
escalation during the implementation of a contract must comply with the 
requirements of R.A. No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act. 
 It is a basic rule that the laws in force at the time the contract was made governs its interpretation and application.
[76]
 In this case, the 
Contract Agreement 
between
 the parties was executed on December 29, 2003. At that time, the law in
 effect is R.A. No. 9184. By express repeal, the Act, which took effect 
on January 26, 2003, superseded P.D. No. 1594.
[77]
 
 Section 61
[78]

 of R.A. No. 9184 explicitly provides that any given scope of work in 
the contract as awarded shall be for the fixed price specified therein. 
Any increase in the contract price is subject to prior determination by 
the NEDA of the existence of an extraordinary circumstance and approval 
of the GPPB. It is only after which that contract price escalation may 
be authorized and paid.
[79]
 
  The provision is clarified by the rules implementing R.A. No. 9184
[80]
 which was then in effect at the time of the contract, 
viz
.: 
  


 
Section 61. Contract Prices 


x x x x 


 61.2. Any request for price escalation under extraordinary 
circumstances shall be submitted by the concerned entity to the National
 Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) with the endorsement of the 
procuring entity. The burden of proving the occurrence of extraordinary 
circumstances that will allow for price escalation shall rest with the 
entity requesting for such escalation. NEDA shall only respond to such 
request after receiving the proof and the necessary documentation. 


 61.3. For purposes of this Section, "extraordinary 
circumstances" shall refer to events that may be determined by the NEDA 
in accordance with the Civil Code of the Philippines, and upon the 
recommendation of the procuring entity concerned. 




 Evidently, price escalation in a contract for public works is not 
immediately executory by mere specification in contract. There is a 
procedure to be followed. A recommendation must first be made by the 
procuring entity of the existence of an extraordinary circumstance. 
Then, the NEDA would make a determination confirming the justification 
offered by the procuring entity. After finding that an extraordinary 
circumstance exists thus justifying the payment of price escalation, the
 request would have to be forwarded to the GPPB for approval.
[81]

 It is only after the GPPB signifies its approval of the price 
escalation claim that the payment can be processed and released by the 
government entity concerned to the contractor. 
 In this case, it 
is not contested that the petitioner failed to observe the foregoing 
procedure prior to his approval of the disbursement voucher and signing 
of the Landbank check in favor of Markbilt. This is supported by a 
Certification
[82]
 dated July 
25, 2012 issued by the NEDA to the effect that it had not received any 
request from the Municipality of Daet for exemption and/or approval for 
the payment of escalation price. 
 In justifying the failure to 
comply with the requirements of R.A. No. 9184, the petitioner posits 
that it had the right to rely upon the legal opinion of Legal Officer 
Deveza that there was no reason to refuse the payment of obligation to 
Markbilt. He argues that the same is complete, adequately supported by 
sufficient legal principles, and has in its favor the presumption of 
regularity which the prosecution herein failed to rebut.
[83]
 

 The petitioner also raised the defense of good faith to negate criminal
 intent in the charge for malversation. Succinctly, he claims that the 
doctrine in 
Arias v. Sandiganbayan
[84]

 is applicable to him. Petitioner claims that in approving the payment 
of price escalation in favor of Markbilt, he merely relied in good faith
 on the opinion of Legal Officer Deveza, the certifications and approval
 of Budget Officer Laborte and other local officials, and the presumed 
validity of Appropriation No. 1.
[85]
 
 The ruling in 
Arias 
does not apply; it cannot exculpate petitioner from liability. In 
Arias
,
 the Court held that "[a]ll heads of offices have to rely to a 
reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those 
who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations."
[86]
 In subsequent cases, it was made clear nonetheless that "the 
Arias

 doctrine is not an absolute rule. It is not a magic cloak that can be 
used as a cover by a public officer to conceal himself in the shadows of
 his subordinates and necessarily escape liability."
[87]

 When there are circumstances that should have alerted heads of offices 
to exercise a higher degree of circumspection in the performance of 
their duties, they cannot invoke the doctrine to escape liability. In 
this scenario, heads of offices are expected to exercise more diligence 
and go beyond what their subordinates have prepared.
[88]

 In the same vein, the presumption of regularity "obtains only when 
there is no deviation from the regular performance of duty. Where the 
official act in question is irregular on its face, no presumption of 
regularity can arise."
[89]
 

 In this case, the Court finds the existence of such circumstances which
 could have alerted the petitioner to inquire further prior to his 
approval of the disbursement voucher, beyond the certifications and 
documents issued by municipal officials. 
 To recall, the 
Contract Agreement

 for the construction of the Daet Public Market (Phase II) was entered 
into on December 29, 2003, during the petitioner's term as Municipal 
Mayor. Actual construction commenced in January 2005.
[90]

 Months thereafter or in December 2005, allegedly on account of 
spiraling costs of materials during the construction period, Markbilt 
filed a claim for the adjustment of contract price pursuant to the price
 escalation clause of the 
Contract Agreement
.

During the intervening period or in May 2004, Mayor Panotes was 
elected as Municipal Mayor of Daet It was sometime in June 2005, during 
his term, that the Phase II construction project was completed. 
Thereafter, Markbilt continued to file several letter-requests 
reiterating its claim for price escalation. However, then Mayor Panotes 
refused to act upon the claims until the end of his term in June 2007. 
It was when the petitioner was re-elected that Markbilt's claim was 
processed and eventually paid in May 2008.
[93]


 Considering that two years had passed since the project's 
completion and more than three years since the first demand for payment 
of price escalation was made by Markbilt, the petitioner could have 
inquired into the circumstances attending the demand and the 
construction project and why the same was unacted upon by his 
predecessor. Instead of immediately instructing Administrator Nagera to 
look for sources of funds, he should have sought the opinion of the 
Municipal Engineer. Petitioner should have at the very least referred 
the documents relative to construction project to the appropriate 
municipal officials for study in order to verify the basis of Markbilt's
 claim. This is particularly relevant as majority of the project was 
undertaken and ultimately completed prior to his term. As well, the 
amount appropriated for the Daet Public Market (Phase II) construction 
project has already been fully released. Markbilt's demand is over and 
beyond the contract price and dependent upon the cost of materials 
almost three years passed. Simply, the propriety of Markbilt's 
additional claim depends upon the prevailing market prices at the time 
they were purchased vis-Ã -vis the costs when the contract was entered 
into. In this regard, prudence dictates that further verification be 
conducted as to the veracity of the amount claimed by Markbilt. The 
amount involved is by no means trivial; it involves millions of pesos of
 public funds. Petitioner, as head of office, should have taken this 
precaution in order to safeguard the government funds for which he is 
responsible
[94]
 and to protect the interests of the municipality. 
  
In this case, after receiving Markbilt's demand, petitioner 
immediately referred the same to Administrator Nageta and instructed him
 to look for sources of funds in order to satisfy the same, without 
taking steps first in order to verify the propriety of Markbilt's 
additional claim for payment. It is this act which set the process in 
motion. Ultimately, it was the petitioner's signature on the 
disbursement voucher and Landbank check that allowed Markbilt to encash 
the P1,000,000.00 partial payment for contract price escalation, despite
 not being entitled thereto. This satisfied the last element of the 
offense and rendered the crime of malversation complete. 
  
 The petitioner was also charged with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019,
[95]
 the elements of which are the following: 
  


 a) The accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions; 


 b) He must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or inexcusable negligence; and


 c) That his action caused any undue injury to any party, 
including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.
[96]




 As defined and applied in this case, the offense has common 
elements with the crime of malversation, in particular, the first and 
second elements. Having previously elucidated on the same, the Court 
need not discuss the same in detail. 
 In approving the release of
 payment in favor of Markbilt, it is no contest that the petitioner 
acted in the performance of his administrative and official functions. 

 Moving on to the second element, for a successful prosecution under 
Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, it is not enough that undue injury was 
caused, the act must be performed through manifest partiality, evident 
bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
[97]
 Pertinent to the issue at hand, "gross inexcusable negligence" has been defined as â
  


 [t]he want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a 
situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully 
and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so 
far as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care 
which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their 
own property.
[98]
 




 The Court affirms that the petitioner is guilty of gross 
inexcusable negligence amounting to bad faith. From the stated 
definition, there is gross inexcusable negligence when a public officer 
commits a breach of duty in a blatant and extremely careless manner; or 
when the violation of law is serious, flagrant, palpable, or there is 
willful indifference in complying with the same. 
 As previously 
discussed, the petitioner was remiss in his duty when he failed to 
exercise diligence in ensuring compliance with basic requirements 
demanded by the law, rules, and regulations in the disbursement of 
public funds. First, as the signatory in the 
Contract Agreement
 
with Markbilt, he is presumed to know the contents thereof. On its face,
 the instrument only provides for a single appropriation for the 
construction project; there is no separate funding to support the 
contract price escalation clause therein. In the statement of the said 
clause, the parties covenant to comply with relevant rules and 
regulations with respect to the same. Albeit unnecessary, they 
explicitly incorporated the relevant guidelines with respect to 
adjustment of contract prices. Thus, 	upon 	receipt 	of 	Markbilt's	
demand 	for price escalation, prudence dictates for the petitioner to 
first verify the propriety of the said claim and whether the said claim 
satisfies the requirements of applicable laws. It is only then that the 
possibility of satisfying the claim can even be entertained. It is 
highly irregular and unusual to rely merely on the representation of the
 contractor as to the amount due, without validating whether the amount 
so claimed is accurate and correct. Likewise, it must be noted that 
petitioner was already confronted with Markbilt's demands for price 
escalation as early as January 21, 2008. Even so, there was no evidence 
on record of any effort on the part of the petitioner to direct 
municipal officials to inquire on the basis of Markbilt's claims 
vis-Ã -vis the Contract Agreement which is cited as basis therefor, when 
he had every opportunity to do so prior to release of Legal Officer 
Deveza's opinion and the preparation of the Supplemental Budget. This 
step could have easily alerted the petitioner or the municipal officials
 of the requirements of price escalation under the law, particularly 
that provided for under Sec. 61 of R.A. No. 9184. 
 Had the 
petitioner undertaken these steps, he would have realized, for reasons 
previously stated in this decision, that Markbilt's claim should be 
denied. The petitioner's failure to observe sufficient diligence under 
these circumstances, which led to violation of the law and the rules 
relating to disbursement of public funds amounts to gross inexcusable 
negligence. 
 Finally, the Court likewise finds that the 
prosecution was able to prove the element of undue injury. Jurisprudence
 defined "undue injury" as actual damage established by evidence as 
caused by the questioned conduct by the offender.
[99]

 The petitioner's approval of the disbursement voucher and signature in 
the Landbank check in favor of Markbilt facilitated the unauthorized 
release of P1,000,000.00 of public funds which belong to the 
Municipality of Daet. As it is established that Markbilt is not entitled
 to such payment, the Sandiganbayan was correct in ruling that the 
petitioner caused undue injury in this amount, which then petitioner 
must return. 
 With respect to the penalty, the Court finds the 
penalties imposed by the Sandiganbayan to be in order and should not be 
disturbed. 
 Article 217 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 10951,
[100]
 provides that a person guilty of malversation shall suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum and medium periods, if the amount involved is more than P40,000.00 but does not exceed P1,200,000.00.
[101]
 Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL),
[102]
 the imposable minimum penalty shall be anywhere within 
prision correccional

 in its medium and maximum periods or 2 years, 4 months and 1 day to 6 
years. In view of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, 
the maximum penalty, on the other hand, shall be within the minimum 
period of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum and medium periods or 6 years and 1 day to 7 years and 4 months.
[103]
 The indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of
 prision correccional
, as minimum, to six (6) years and one (1) day of
 prision mayor
, as maximum; imposed by the 
Sandiganbayan 
which
 is within the stated range, is hereby affirmed. In addition, as 
adjudged, likewise by virtue of Article 217 of the RPC, petitioner must 
also be meted with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification 
from holding public office and ordered to pay a fine equal to the amount
 of funds malversed, herein equivalent to P1,000,000.00 plus interest 
thereon at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
, reckoned from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.
[104]
 Whereas, under Section 9(a)
[105]

 of R.A. No. 3019, a person found guilty of violating Section 3(e) of 
the same law is punishable with imprisonment for not less than six (6) 
years and one (1) month nor more than fifteen (15) years, and perpetual 
disqualification from public office. Applying the ISL, the penalty shall
 not be less than the minimum term nor exceed the maximum term fixed by 
the law.
[106]
 Thus, the 
penalty imposed by the Sandiganbayan which is indeterminate penalty of 
imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight 
(8) years, as maximum, is in accord with law. 
 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition for review on 
certiorari
 is hereby 
DENIED
. The Decision dated September 29, 2017 and the Resolution dated November 8, 2018 of the
 Sandiganbayan

DISSENTING OPINION 




 CAGUIOA, 
J
.:


 I respectfully register my dissent.
 I submit that 
petitioner Tito S. Sarion (petitioner) cannot and should not be 
convicted for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, as
 amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, 
and the crime of Malversation of Public Funds or Property under Article 
217 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). 
 After a careful review of 
the facts of the case, it is crystal clear that petitioner cannot be 
convicted of the two crimes he was charged with. 
 
Brief review of the facts

 Petitioner was charged with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019,
 as amended, and Malversation of Public Funds, in two separate 
Informations, the accusatory portions of which read: 
  


 
SB-11-CRM-0256


 That on 24 April 2008 or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, 
in Daet, a first class municipality in the Province of Camarines Norte, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
accused, 
Tito S. Sarion
, a public officer, being the Mayor of the
 Municipality of Daet, committing the crime in the discharge of his 
official functions, through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or 
gross inexcusable negligence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, 
and criminally cause undue injury to the government in the gross amount 
of One Million Pesos, Philippine Currency (PhP1,000,000.00), by then and
 there approving the disbursement in the 
absence of certificate of availability of funds
,
 of public funds in said gross amount in favor of Markbilt Construction,
 the contractor for the construction of Daet Public Market (Phase II), 
as partial payment for its claim for price escalation which it is not 
entitled to so receive but which it received nevertheless per its 
Official Receipt No. 1156 dated 24 April 2008 through the approval of 
the disbursement voucher by the accused even 
without the approval 
from the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) and the 
determination by the National Economic Deveiopment Authority (NEDA) as 
to the propriety of the claim for price escalation in violation of the 
GPPB Guidelines for Contract price Escalation
 to the prejudice of the Municipality of Daet in said amount. 


 
CONTRARY TO LAW. 


SB-11-CRM-0257


 That on 24 April 2008, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, 
in Daet, a first class municipality in the Province of Camarines Norte, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
accused, 
Tito S. Sarion
, a public officer, being the Mayor of the
 Municipality of Daet, while in the performance of his official 
functions, committing the offense in relation to his office, and taking 
advantage of his official position, and in grave abuse thereof, having 
control of public funds in the gross amount of One Million Pesos, 
Philippine Currency (PhP1,000,000.00), which was placed under his 
administration by reason of the duties of his office, and is accountable
 for said amount of public funds pursuant to Section 340 of the Local 
Government Code, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously consent, 	or through abandonment or negligence, permit 
Markbilt Construction, the contractor for the construction of Daet 
Public Market (Phase II), to take such amount of public funds which it 
is not entitled to receive but which it received nevertheless per its 
Official Receipt No. 1156 dated 24 April 2008, by then and there 
allowing the disbursement through his approval of the disbursement 
voucher 
even in the absence of certificate of availability of funds
 in said gross amount in favor of Markbilt Construction as partial payment for its claim for the price escalation 
even
 without the approval from the Government Procurement Policy Board 
(GPPB) and the determination by the National Economic Development 
Authority (NEDA) as to the propriety of the claim for price escalation 
in violation of the GPPB Guidelines for Contract price Escalation.


 
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[1]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 The instant controversy arose from a 
Contract Agreement
 
entered into on December 29, 2003 by herein petitioner, in his capacity 
as Municipal Mayor for the Municipal Government of Daet, Camarines 
Norte, and Mr. Billy Aceron (Aceron), General Manager of Markbilt 
Construction (Markbilt), represented by his attorney-in-fact, Architect 
Romeo B. Itturalde (Architect Itturalde).The agreement was for the Phase
 II construction of the Daet Public Market for the amount of 
P71,499,875.29, which was to be completed within a period of 365 
calendar days.
[2]
 On January 5, 2005, petitioner approved a 
Notice to Commence Work
 authorizing Markbilt to commence with the construction project on the 10
th

 day from receipt of said Notice. Thereafter, construction works 
proceeded. Meanwhile, petitioner's term ended and Elmer E. Panotes 
(Mayor Panotes) was elected as Municipal Mayor of Daet, Camarines Norte 
during the May 2004 national and local elections.
[3]
 

 The construction of the Daet Public Market was completed sometime in 
2006. On November 13, 2006, the Office of Mayor Panotes received a 
letter from Markbilt, requesting the processing and payment of contract 
price escalation in the amount of P5,222,903.75, in relation to the Daet
 Public Market (Phase II) project. Mayor Panotes refused to act on the 
demand.
[4]
 During the local elections held in 2007, petitioner was re-elected as Mayor of the Municipality of Daet.
[5]

 On January 21, 2008, in a letter addressed to petitioner, Markbilt 
reiterated its demand for payment of the contract price escalation.
[6]

 A similar demand was made by Markbilt in a letter dated February 7, 
2008, this time with the information that it would be imposing a 15% 
interest 
per annum
 on the claim.
[7]

 Because of this demand, petitioner instructed Municipal Administrator 
Elmer Nagera (Administrator Nagera) to look for sources of funds to 
satisfy Markbilt's claim.
[8]
 
This gave rise to the creation of Supplemental Budget No. 1. After the 
same was signed by Municipal Budget Officer Amelia P. Laborte (Budget 
Officer Laborte) and approved by Administrator Nagera, Supplemental 
Budget No. 1 was submitted to the 
Sangguniang Bayan
.
[9]
 On March 6, 2008, the 
Sangguniang Bayan

 passed Resolution No. 063 unanimously approving Supplemental Budget No.
 1 and appropriating the amount of P11,222,088.00 of the municipality's 
internal revenue allotment. Of such amount, designated under the Special
 Account, P4,400,000.00 was allotted for the construction of market. 
Resolution No. 063 was later approved by petitioner.
[10]

 In another letter dated April 14, 2008, Markbilt reiterated its demand 
for payment of contract price escalation. After Budget Officer Laborte 
certified the existence of available appropriation, Administrator Nagera
 prepared Obligation Request No. 100-08-03-402 certifying that "the 
charges to appropriation/allotment are necessary, lawful and under his 
direct supervision" and that "the supporting documents are valid, proper
 and legal."
[11]
 Subsequently,
 Administrator Nagera issued Disbursement Voucher No. 08041239 in the 
amount of P1,000,000.00 payable to Markbilt in partial satisfaction of 
its demand for contract price escalation.
[12]
 

 Concerned with the applicability of R.A. No. 9184, otherwise known as 
the "Government Procurement Reform Act," Municipal Accountant Caroline 
Maisie Robles (Accountant Robles) consulted the Commission on Audit 
(COA) Auditor assigned to the municipality, who in tum, advised her to 
seek the opinion of the Municipal Legal Officer. 
In his opinion, Municipal 
 
Legal Officer Edmundo Deveza II
 (
Legal Officer Deveza
) 
found, on the basis of Presidential Decree
 (
P.D.
) 
No. 1594,
[13]
 
that there was no reason to refuse the payment of obligation in favor of Markbilt
.
 Thus, on April 21, 2008, Accountant Robles certified the supporting 
documents complete and the allotment for partial payment of Markbilt.
[14]

 After Municipal Treasurer Arlyn O. Aberia certified that funds were 
available, petitioner approved the release of the funds for payment.
[15]

 Thus, on April 24, 2008, Markbilt received payment of P1,000,000.00 
made through Landbank Check No. 0272388, and evidenced by Official 
Receipt No. 1156 dated April 24, 2008.
[16]
 
 On June 17, 2008, the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan

 of Camarines Norte, approved Resolution No. 229-2008 declaring as 
operative Supplemental Budget No. 1 of the Municipality of Daet.
[17]
 

 On November 27, 2008, Zenaida Baluca, a resident of Daet, Camarines 
Norte, filed a complaint against petitioner before the Deputy Ombudsman 
for Luzon.
[18]
 The complainant
 charged petitioner with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 
relative to the payment of contract price escalation in the Daet Public 
Market (Phase II) Project.
[19]
 

 After investigation, Graft Investigation and Prosecution officer Judy 
Anne Doctor-Escalona found merit in the complaint and charged petitioner
 with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, as amended, and 
Malversation of Public Funds, in two separate Informations.
[20]
 
 Petitioner was conditionally arraigned on September 2, 2011, and assisted by counsel, entered a plea of "not guilty."
[21]
 
 After trial, the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan rendered on September 29, 2017 the herein assailed Decision
[22]

 finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of 
Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and Malversation of Public Funds.
[23]
 The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
  


 
WHEREFORE
, this Court finds accused 
TITO S. SARION
: 






1.

c.

 	 Accused Sarion shall indemnify the municipality of Daet the 
amount of One Million Pesos (PhP1,000,000.00) as actual damages, plus 
interest at the rate of 6% per annum to be reckoned from the date of 
finality of the Decision until full satisfaction. 


 
SO ORDERED.
[24]
 




 Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was thereafter denied by the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution dated November 8, 2018.
[25]
 
 Thus, this petition for review on 
certiorari
.
[26]


In affirming the conviction of petitioner for the crime of 
Malversation of Public Funds
, the 
ponencia
 rules that the prosecution was able to prove all of the elements of said crime:
[27]

 (1) that petitioner is a public officer, being the then elected 
Municipal Mayor of Daet and that the funds involved are public in 
character, as they belong to the Municipality of Daet;
[28]

 (2) that, by reason of his office, he is an accountable officer based 
on Section 340 of the Local Government Code, as well as P.D. No. 1445 or
 the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines;
[29]

 (3) that the disbursement or release of funds had petitioner's approval
 as Mayor; and that payment in favor of Markbilt was released only after
 petitioner's signature in the disbursement voucher and the 
corresponding Landbank check;
[30]

 and (4) agreeing with the Sandiganbayan, that petitioner was guilty of 
gross inexcusable negligence when he permitted Markbilt to receive 
partial payment of 
price escalation despite not being entitled thereto.
[31]


 The 
ponencia
 reasons that when petitioner signed the 
disbursement voucher in favor of Markbilt, he certified to the 
correctness of the entries therein, warranted that the expenses incurred
 were necessary and lawful, the supporting documents were complete, and 
the availability of cash therefor.
[32]

 By approving the disbursement voucher and signing the Landbank check 
payable to Markbilt, despite the absence of funding and failure to 
comply with the requirements of Section 61,
[33]
 R.A. No. 9184, petitioner permitted Markbilt to take public funds to which it is not entitled to.
[34]
 In affirming petitioner's conviction for violation of 
Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019
, the 
ponencia
 again anchors this on the finding that petitioner is guilty of gross inexcusable negligence "amounting to bad faith."
[35]
 The 
ponencia

 justifies its ruling on the following: (1) petitioner was remiss in his
 duty when he failed to exercise diligence in ensuring compliance with 
basic requirements demanded by the laws, rules, and regulations in the 
disbursement of public funds;
[36]
 (2) as the signatory to the 
Contract Agreement 
with Markbilt, he is presumed to know the contents thereof;
[37]

 thus (3) upon receipt of Markbilt's demand for price escalation, 
petitioner should have first verified the propriety of the said claim 
and whether the said claim satisfied the requirements of applicable 
laws.
[38]
 
 The
 ponencia
 likewise finds that the prosecution was able to prove the element of undue injury, as follows:
[39]

 (1) petitioner's approval of the disbursement voucher and his signature
 in the Landbank check in favor of Markbilt facilitated the unauthorized
 release of P1,000,000.00 worth of public funds which belong to the 
Municipality of Daet,
[40]
 (2) since Markbilt was not entitled to such payment, petitioner thus caused undue injury in this amount.
[41]
 
 I strongly disagree with the foregoing findings of the 
ponencia
. To be sure, a careful review of the records shows that the foregoing findings are all 
belied

 by the evidence presented before the Sandiganbayan. I furthermore 
submit that following established jurisprudence, petitioner cannot be 
held guilty of "gross inexcusable negligence" for an act that was legal 
and fully compliant with the requirements of law. It is simply unjust to
 convict him; he should be acquitted of the crimes he is charged with. 
 While the Sandiganbayan Decision and the
 ponencia 
extensively
 discussed in relation to the crime of Malversation (1) the absence of 
Certificate of Availability of Funds (CAFs); and (2) petitioner's 
violation of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Guidelines 
for Contract Price Escalation, and the absence of a determination by the
 National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) as to the propriety of 
the claim for price escalation, I likewise relate these discussions as 
far as applicable to R.A. No. 3019. 
 I. 

    Republic Act No. 3019


 R.A. No. 3019, Section 3(e) reads: 




 SECTION 3. Corrupt practices of public officers.âIn addition to 
acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, 
the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer 
and are hereby declared to be unlawful: 




 x x x x


 (e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the 
Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, 
advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative 
or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or 
gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and
 employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant 
of licenses or permits or other concessions. 






 In order for an accused to be convicted under Section 3(e) of R.A.
 No. 3019, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the 
following essential elements: (1) the accused must be a public officer 
discharging administrative, judicial or official functions; (2) he must 
have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or inexcusable 
negligence; and (3) his action caused undue injury to any party, 
including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.
[42]
 
 I submit that the last two elements were not established at all. 
  




Under existing case law, petitioner cannot be found to have committed gross inexcusable negligence
 






There are three modes of committing a violation under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, to wit: 
  


 x x x There is "
manifest partiality
" when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. "
Evident bad faith
"
 connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently 
fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious 
wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. "Evident bad faith" 
contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design
 or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior 
purposes. "
Gross inexcusable negligence
" refers to negligence 
characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting
 to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently 
but willfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to 
consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.
[43]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 At the very outset, it should be emphasized that the Sandiganbayan found and held that petitioner 
did 
not
 commit manifest partiality
, to wit. 
  


 Accused Sarion's approval of the payment for price escalation to
 Markbilt, without the requisite approval of the GPPB and NEDA's 
determination of the existence of extraordinary circumstances, 
does not necessarily imply manifest partiality

 on the part of the accused. Records do not show that accused Sarion 
favored Markbilt over another entity when he authorized the subject 
payment.
[44]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The Sandiganbayan likewise held that petitioner 
did 
not
 act in evident bad faith
, to wit: 
  


 
The evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion that accused Sarion was motivated by ill-will or dishonest purpose

 in paying Markbilt's demand for payment of contract price escalation. 
Accused Sarion appears to have relied on the legal opinion issued by the
 municipal legal officer which states: a) that P.D. No. 1594 is the 
applicable law in connection with Markbilt's claim for price escalation;
 b) The escalation prices were allegedly computed in accordance with the
 IRR of P.D. No. 1594; and c) There was no reason to refuse payment for 
price escalation. As concluded above, it appears that accused Sarion did
 not act in bad faith.
[45]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The Sandiganbayan convicted petitioner on the belief that he acted
 with gross inexcusable negligence when he approved the payment of the 
price escalation in favor of Markbilt without confirming that it was 
lawfully entitled thereto.
[46]
 

 To recall, petitioner was charged under the Information for causing 
undue injury to the government because of his having approved the 
payment to Markbilt of P1,000,000.00, as partial payment for its claim 
for contract price escalation: (1) in the absence of CAFs; and (2) in 
violation of the GPPB Guidelines for Contract Price Escalation as the 
payment was made despite the absence of an approval from the GPPB, and 
in the absence of a determination by NEDA as to the propriety of the 
claim for price escalation.
[47]
 
 Thus, the only question is this: Were these acts of petitioner committed with gross inexcusable negligence? 
 The 
ponencia
 answers in the affirmative. The 
ponencia

 rules that petitioner was remiss in his duty when he failed to exercise
 diligence in "ensuring compliance with basic requirements demanded by 
the law, rules, and regulations in the disbursement of public funds."
[48]
 
 I disagree. This is plain manifest error. 
I discuss these points 
ad seriatim
. 
 
First
,
 it should be noted that the Information for violation of Section 3(e) 
of R.A. No. 3019 alleges that petitioner approved the disbursement "in 
the 
absence
 of certificate of availability of funds."
[49]
 However, the Sandiganbayan found as a fact that there were CAFs, ruling only that there was an 
irregularity
 in the CAF: 
  


 The information charges accused Sarion of disbursing 
PhP1,000,000.00 in favor of Markbilt without a certificate of 
availability of funds. Disbursement Voucher No. 08041239 shows that 
Municipal Treasurer Arlyn Aberia certified to the availability of funds.
 Municipal Budget Officer Amelia P. Laborte certified, in the Obligation
 Request, to the existence of available appropriation. 
However, the certifications were irregular.
 Appropriation Ordinance No. 1 contained no appropriation for the payment of the amount of PhP1,000,000.00 to Markbilt.

 Appropriation Ordinance No. 1 shows that the appropriation was for the 
construction of the public market. There was no appropriation to pay for
 the contract price escalation, an obligation supposedly incurred in the
 already completed of the Daet Public Market. 


 Accused Sarion and his witnesses point to the deliberations of 
the Sangguniang Bayan. But the intent to pay the contract price 
escalation allegedly manifested during the deliberations are (sic) not 
reflected in Appropriation Ordinance No. 1. Notably, no documentary 
evidence was offered to prove the alleged deliberations.
[50]
 (Emphasis supplied and underscoring in the original)




 The Sandiganbayan further ruled: 
  


 Accused Sarion cannot blindly rely on the erroneous 
certification of his municipal budget officer that funds are available 
because he was the one who approved the Supplemental Budget Ordinance 
and it was clear that no appropriation for the contract price escalation
 was included therein. 
Nonetheless, the Court notes that the 
Information alleges the absence of, not the infirmity in, the 
certificate of availability of funds. Hence, the court cannot find him 
culpable for said action
.
[51]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 In spite of the Sandiganbayan's ruling that it cannot find 
petitioner culpable for the alleged irregularity in the CAF since "the 
Information alleges the absence of, not infirmity in, the [CAF],"
[52]
 the 
ponencia
 nevertheless rules as follows: 
  


 An Information is sufficient when it states the designation of 
the offense and the acts or omissions which constitute the offense 
charged. The crime must be described in ordinary and concise language 
and with such particularity and reasonable certainty that the accused is
 duly informed of the offense charged and able to adequately prepare for
 his defense. "In particular, whether an Information validly charges an 
offense depends on whether the material facts alleged in the complaint 
or information shall establish the essential elements of the offense 
charged as defined in the law." 


 To recapitulate, Section 86 of P.D. No. 1445 requires the 
existence of a prior specific appropriation, as certified by the proper 
accounting official, before any contract for expenditure of public funds
 is authorized. 
In this sense, therefore, it is the absence of 
certification as to the availability of or source of funds pertaining 
specifically to the payment of price escalation, that rendered the 
clause void and the subsequent approval by the petitioner of the 
disbursement voucher invalid. It is this irregularity which rendered the
 payment in favor of Markbilt illegal.
 In turn, it is the 
transgression of the same basic principle in disbursement of public 
funds which translates to gross negligence on the part of the 
petitioner. With this, the elements of the offense sufficiently alleged 
and proven in the Information, there is no obstacle in convicting the 
petitioner of the crime of malversation. 


 At any rate, granting for the sake of argument that the failure 
of the Information to specifically employ the word "irregularity" 
instead of "absence" constitutes a violation of the petitioner's right 
to Information and as such may not be considered in determining the 
offenses charged, the petitioner may nonetheless be still be convicted 
of the crime of malversation and for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 
No. 3019 "through [his] approval of the disbursement voucher x x x even 
without the approval from the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB)
 and the determination by the National Economic Development Authority 
(NEDA) as to the propriety of the claim for price escalation in 
violation of the GPPB Guidelines for Contract Price Escalation," clearly
 stated and alleged in the two (2) Informations filed against him. x x x
[53]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 The foregoing ruling violates petitioner's right, as an accused, to be properly informed of the charges against him.
[54]
 As correctly pointed out by petitioner, he cannot be found guilty for an 
irregularity

 in the CAFs because this violates his right to be informed of the 
accusation against him under Section 14(1), Article III of the 1987 
Constitution since the Information merely alleged the 
absence
 of CAFs, and 
not irregularity
.
[55]

 Stated differently, petitioner prepared for trial to prove, as he did, 
that there was a CAP. To convict him now on the reasoning that the CAP 
was "
irregular
" unduly deprived him the opportunity to directly traverse this. 

 More importantly, even the finding that there was an "irregularity" is 
wrong â it is completely belied by the evidence. This finding of 
"irregularity" in the CAF is based on the belief that "[t]here was no 
appropriation to pay for the contract price escalation."
[56]
 The Sandiganbayan, as well as the 
ponencia
, holds that Appropriation Ordinance No. 01
[57]
 contained no appropriation for the payment of P1,000,000.00 to Markbilt.
[58]
 At the point of being repetitive, this is just plain error. 
 The plain language of Supplemental Budget No. 1
[59]
 belies this factual finding. To recall, Resolution No. 063 approved Supplemental Budget No. 1 for CY
[60]
 2008 for the Municipality of Daet. It was this Supplemental Budget No. 1
[61]
 that was approved in Appropriation Ordinance No. 01. Stated simply, 
Appropriation
 Ordinance No. 01 approved each and every proposed item in Supplemental 
Budget No. 1, including the payment of P1,000,000.00 for the price 
escalation claim of Markbilt
.
[62]
 As correctly shown by petitioner: 
  


 The title of Resolution No. 063 is revealing as to what was approved by the Sangguniang Bayan, that is, 
Supplemental Budget No. 1
, which contained an appropriation of P1,000,000.00 to partially pay Markbilt Construction's claim for price escalation â




 Resolution Approving the 
Supplemental Budget No. 01 for CY 2008

 for the Municipality of Daet Appropriating the Amount of Six Million 
Eight Hundred Twenty Two Thousand Eighty Eight Pesos (P6,822,088.00) for
 Various Municipal Projects/Expenditures under the General Fund Proper 
and for Special Account (Market) â Construction of Public Market 
Amounting to Four Million Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P4,400,00.00) 
with a Total Amount of Eleven Million Two Hundred Twenty Two Thousand 
Eighty Eight Pesos (P11,222,088.00).
[63]




 Likewise, it is apparent in the title of Appropriation Ordinance No. 01 as to what was approved by the Sangguniang Bayan: 




 An Ordinance Approving the 
Supplemental Budget No. 01 for CY 2008

 for the Municipality of Daet Appropriating the Amount of Six Million 
Eight Hundred Twenty Two Thousand Eighty Eight Pesos (P6,822,088.00) for
 Various Municipal Projects/Expenditures under the General Fund Proper 
and for Special Account (Market) â Construction of Public Market 
Amounting to Four Million Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P4,400,00.00) 
with a Total Amount of Eleven Million Two Hundred Twenty Two Thousand 
Eighty Eight Pesos (P11,222,088.00).
[64]
 




 The portion of Appropriation Ordinance No. 01, which 
appropriated the amount of P4,400,000.00 as "Special Account (Market) 
Construction of Market" exactly corresponded to the appropriated items 
in that portion of Supplemental Budget No. 1 sub-marked as 
Exhibit 21-Q-1
, which to repeat had these components: 








Subsidy to Special Account â Market






Construction of Market


1,500,000.00






Price Escalation


1,000,000.00






Improvement/Repair Market
 


1,900,000.00
[65]
 






 


 








 	These appropriated items would add up to 
P4,400,000.00
, which is Exhibit 
9-A-1
 of the prosecution. 


 A cursory examination of Supplemental Budget No. 1 would show 
that the proposed appropriations therein were all approved and adopted 
in Appropriation Ordinance No. 01, as shown by the fact that 
Supplemental Budget No. 1 proposed a total appropriation of 
P11,222,088.00, which was the same approved amount in Appropriation 
Ordinance No. 01. 


 In other words, Appropriation Ordinance No. 01 approved each and
 every proposed item in Supplemental Budget No. 01, including the 
payment of P1,000,000.00 for the price escalation claim of Markbilt 
Construction.
[66]
 




 In other words, contrary to the findings of the Sandiganbayan and the 
ponencia
, there 
was
 a valid appropriation to pay for the contract price escalation. 

 Accordingly, since there was a regularly issued CAF prior to 
petitioner's approval of the Disbursement Voucher, it is egregious error
 to still rule that petitioner acted with gross inexcusable negligence 
when he approved the Disbursement Vouchers.
[67]
 
Second
,
 on the alleged non-compliance with Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184, the 
evidence shows that: (1) the alleged non-compliance with Section 61 of 
R.A. No. 9184 did not pertain to petitioner; and (2) even assuming that 
compliance with Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184 pertained to petitioner, 
R.A. No. 9184 does not penalize the alleged irregularity.
[68]
 As correctly pointed out by petitioner, in the Notice of Disallowance
[69]

 with ND No. 2010-001-101 (2008) dated March 17, 2010, the obligation to
 secure the documents required under Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184 did not
 pertain to petitioner, but to Architect Itturalde for Aceron â

[70]
 








This is, in turn, fully corroborated by the admission of 
prosecution witnesses Jesus R. Reblora, Jr. (Reblora) and Lourdes G. 
Cribe (Cribe) that the obligation to submit the required documents in 
compliance with Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184 did not pertain to 
petitioner, but to Architect Itturalde for Aceron.
[71]
 


 On cross-examination, the COA Audit Team Leader,
[72]
 Reblora, testified as follows: 
  






Q:


 
Do you confirm that the 
representatives of Markbilt Construction namely: Romeo B. [Itturalde], 
Mr. A[c]eron, also appeared in the Notice of Disallowance?






 


 






A:


Yes, sir. 






 


 






Q:


Now do you confirm also sir that in 
this entry regarding the nature of participation in the transaction of 
Romeo [Itturalde] of Mr. Billy A[c]eron or the representatives of 
Markbilt Construction, reads, "failure to submit the required documents 
in compliance to Section [6]1 of RA 9184," do you confirm that that is 
the nature of participation? (
sic
)






 


 






A:


Yes, sir.






 


 






Q:


Therefore, the alleged irregularity of 
the subject transaction which was [the] absence of that GPP[B] approval 
pertained to the representatives of Markbilt Construction per Notice of 
Disallowance, do you confirm that sir?






 


 






A:


 
That is part of the process. 






 


 






Q:


My question is answerable by yes or no 
regarding this Notice of Disallowance that requirement belong[s] to Mr. 
Romeo [Itturalde] or Billy Aceron?






 


 






A:


Yes, sir.
[73]
 








Cribe, who was the COA State Auditor V and Supervising Auditor who 
issued the Notice of Disallowance, likewise admitted that the failure to
 submit the required documents in compliance with Section 61 of R.A. No.
 9184 did not appear in the line pertaining to petitioner: 








Q:


Now, [I] show this Notice of 
Disallowance[,] do you confirm that this line here which reads and I 
quote, "failure to submit the required documents in compliance with 
Section 61 of R.A. 9184" does not appear in this line pertaining to Tito
 Sarion?














A:


It does not, sir.
[74]
 








Moreover, even assuming that compliance with Section 61 of R.A. No.
 9184 pertained to him, said law does not actually penalize the alleged 
irregularity.
[75]
 R.A. No. 9184 does not contain a penal clause for not securing a GPPB and a NEDA clearance before payment of price escalation.
[76]


 In this relation, the Court held in 
Sabaldan, Jr. v. Ombudsman
,
[77]
 that violations of procurement laws do not 
ipso facto
 give rise to violation of R.A. No. 3019: 




 More importantly, it must be emphasized that the instant case 
involves a finding of probable cause for a criminal case for violation 
of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, and not for violation of R.A. No. 
9184. 
Hence, even granting that there may be violations of the 
applicable procurement laws, the same does not mean that the elements of
 violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 are already present as a 
matter of course. For there to be a violation under Section 3(e) of R.A.
 No. 3019 based on a breach of applicable procurement laws, one cannot 
solely rely on the mere fact that a violation of procurement laws has 
been committed. 
x x x.
[78]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Thus, in the recent case of 
Martel v. People
,
[79]

  (Martel) the Court ruled that in order to successfully prosecute the 
accused under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 based on a violation of 
procurement laws, the prosecution must prove 
beyond reasonable doubt

 that: (1) the violation of procurement laws caused undue injury to any 
party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference, and (2) the accused acted with 
evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence.
 
 However, in the instant case, the Sandiganbayan conceded that 
petitioner did not act with evident bad faith or manifest partiality. 
Also, as previously discussed, the prosecution failed to prove that 
petitioner acted with gross inexcusable negligence. Thus, the second 
element is absent. 
 Further, as I stated in my Concurring Opinion in 
Villarosa v. People
[80]
 (
Villarosa
), an accused should not be punished with imprisonment for violations of non-penal laws: 
  


 While I am in full agreement with the call to hammer the point that "public office is a public trust," 
I cannot, in good conscience, agree to punishing with 
imprisonment
 any and all violations of non-penal laws.

 It is true that public servants have a duty to know the limits of the 
authority granted to them. Yet, I cannot subscribe to the thinking that 
to do an act outside of those limits already constitutes "gross 
inexcusable negligence" that is criminally punishable. If that is the 
case, then we might as well dispense with administrative proceedings â 
whether in the Civil Service Commission or in the Ombudsman â against 
public officials, for what is the sense of having a distinction between 
administrative and criminal cases when every single misstep merits a 
criminal sanction. 


 It is also true that every person is presumed to know the law, 
and that ignorance of the law excuses no one from compliance therewith. 
However, it is likewise true that it is unjust to automatically punish someone with a 
criminal sentence
 by virtue of his non-compliance with a 
non-penal rule
.
[81]
 (Emphasis supplied and underscoring in the original) 




 Again, R.A. No. 9184 and R.A. No. 3019 are distinct laws with 
distinct requisites for their violation. A violation of one does not 
ipso facto
 result in a violation of the other.
[82]

 Thus, even assuming that petitioner committed a violation of some 
provisions of R.A. No. 9184, he cannot and should not be convicted under
 R.A. No. 3019 without proof beyond reasonable doubt that the elements 
of a violation of R.A. No. 3019 are all present. 
 The 
ponencia
 insists that petitioner is "guilty of gross inexcusable negligence 
amounting to bad faith
:"
[83]




 The Court affirms that the petitioner is guilty of gross 
inexcusable negligence amounting to bad faith. From the stated 
definition, there is gross inexcusable negligence when a public officer 
commits a breach of duty in a blatant and extremely careless manner; or 
when the violation of law is serious, flagrant, palpable, or there is 
willful indifference in complying with the same. 


 As previously discussed, the petitioner was remiss in his duty 
when he failed to exercise diligence in ensuring compliance with basic 
requirements demanded by the law, rules, and regulations in the 
disbursement of public funds. First, as the signatory in the 
Contract Agreement

 with Markbilt, he is presumed to know the contents thereof. On its 
face, the instrument only provides for a single appropriation for the 
construction project; there is no separate funding to support the 
contract price escalation clause therein. In the statement of the said 
clause, the parties covenant to comply with relevant rules and 
regulations with respect to the same. Albeit unnecessary, they 
explicitly incorporated the relevant guidelines with respect to 
adjustment of contract prices. Thus, upon receipt of Markbilt's demand 
for price escalation, prudence dictates for the petitioner to first 
verify the propriety of the said claim and whether the said claim 
satisfies the requirements of applicable laws. It is only then that the 
possibility of satisfying the claim can even be entertained. It is 
highly irregular and unusual to rely merely on the representation of the
 contractor as to the amount due, without validating whether the amount 
so claimed is accurate and correct. Likewise, it must be noted that 
petitioner was already confronted with Markbilt's demands for price 
escalation as early as January 21, 2008. Even so, there was no evidence 
on record of any effort on the part of the petitioner to direct 
municipal officials to inquire on the basis of Markbilt's claims 
vis-a-vis the Contract Agreement which is cited as basis therefor, when 
he had every opportunity to do so prior to release of Legal Officer 
Deveza's opinion and the preparation of the Supplemental Budget. This 
step could have easily alerted the petitioner or the municipal officials
 of the requirements of price escalation under the law, particularly 
that provided for under Sec. 61 of R.A. No. 9184. 


Had the petitioner undertaken these steps, he would have 
realized, for reasons previously stated in this decision, that 
Markbilt's claim should be denied. The petitioner's failure to observe 
sufficient diligence under these circumstances which led to violation of
 the law and rules relating to disbursement of public funds amounts to 
gross inexcusable negligence.
[84]
 




 In this relation, it is important to stress first of all that 
gross inexcusable negligence does not mean evident bad faith
. In my Concurring Opinion in Villarosa, I stated: 
  


 x x x "Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 may be committed either by 
dolo
, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by 
culpa
,
 as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence." In simple 
terms, "evident bad faith" entails willfulness to do something wrong, 
whereas "gross inexcusable negligence" entails 
failure to exercise the required diligence
 that either results in a wrong or in the failure to prevent the occurrence of a wrongdoing. 
Thus, "gross inexcusable negligence" and "evident bad faith" are separate and distinct from each other.
 x x x
[85]

 Felonies committed by means of 
dolo
 or deceit are those performed with deliberate intent. On the other hand, felonies committed by means of 
culpa
 are those performed with imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.
[86]

 In intentional felonies, the act or omission of the offender is 
malicious. However, in culpable felonies, the act or omission of the 
offender need not be malicious. The wrongful act results from 
imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight or lack of skill.

 Gross inexcusable negligence under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 does 
not require fraudulent intent or ill-will. A public officer is guilty of
 gross inexcusable negligence when there is a breach of duty that is 
committed 
flagrantly, palpably, and with willful indifference
.
[88]

 Hence, a public officer who seriously breaches his or her duty in a 
blatant and extremely careless manner is guilty of gross inexcusable 
negligence under Section 3(e). 
 To stress anew, as held in 
Martel
: 
  


 The commission of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 through gross 
inexcusable negligence requires more than simple negligence. The 
negligence committed must be both 
gross
 and 
inexcusable
, 
characterized
 by the want of even slight care, wherein the accused was consciously 
indifferent as to the compliance with his or her duty as a public 
officer
. More than committing a breach of a legal duty, it is 
necessary that in committing the said breach, the public officer was 
inattentive, thoughtless, and careless.
[89]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics in the original) 




 On this score, the following arguments of petitioner are well-taken:
  


 The Municipal Legal Officer was competent to determine the 
applicable law insofar as the claim was concerned. The Municipal 
Accountant and the Municipal Mayor were not lawyers. They could not be 
faulted for relying on the legal opinion of the Municipal Legal Officer 
who was presumed to know the correct law.


 Thus, Tito Sarion rightfully and lawfully relied in good faith 
on the acts of the other municipal officers who verified the regularity 
of the transaction. 


 There being no patent irregularity and considering that the 
transaction had gone through the proper procedure as certified by the 
officers concerned, Tito Sarion finally gave his approval to the 
Disbursement Voucher. 


 Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable 
man guided by those considerations, which ordinarily regulate the 
conduct of human affairs, would do, or the doing of something which a 
prudent and reasonable man would do. 


 To convict Tito Sarion for an act which appears to be perfectly 
valid and after due regard to the conduct and performance of duty of 
other municipal officers before him, is patently unjust and arbitrary.
[90]




 The records show that petitioner signed on the basis of the acts 
of the other municipal officers who verified the regularity of the 
transaction.
[91]
 All concerned
 municipal officers, including Accountant Robles and petitioner, relied 
on the legal opinion of Legal Officer Deveza.
[92]

 In fact, petitioner did not only sign on the basis of the legal opinion
 of the Legal Officer, but he also relied on all the certifications and 
approvals of all concerned local officials including the presumed 
validity of Appropriation Ordinance No. 01 that approved the 
Supplemental Budget No. 1, which included a P1,000,000.00 appropriation 
for Markbilt Construction.
[93]
 
Thus, petitioner's actions cannot be characterized as one where he acted without even the slightest care
.
 In this regard, the 
ponencia

 insists that petitioner should have taken steps to verify the propriety
 of the said claim and whether the said claim satisfies the requirements
 of applicable laws.
[94]
 The
 ponencia

 further rules that when there are circumstances that should have 
alerted heads of offices to exercise a higher degree of circumspection 
in the performance of their duties, they cannot invoke the doctrine to 
escape liability.
[95]
 In this scenario, heads of offices are expected to exercise more diligence and go beyond what their subordinates have prepared.
[96]

 With all due respect, under the factual milieu of this case, the 
evidence shows that petitioner did exercise the required diligence. The 
fault ascribed to him by the 
ponencia
 simply does not exist, 
viz
.: 
  


 x x x Even so, there was no evidence on record of any effort on 
the part of the petitioner to direct municipal officials to inquire on 
the basis of Markbilt's claims vis-a-vis the Contract Agreement which is
 cited as basis therefor, when he had every opportunity to do so prior 
to release of Legal Officer Deveza's opinion and the preparation of the 
Supplemental Budget. This step could have easily alerted the petitioner 
or the municipal officials of the requirements of price escalation under
 the law, particularly that provided for under Sec. 61 of R.A. No. 9184.
[97]
 




 The fact remains that Legal Officer Deveza gave his legal opinion 
that the demand of Markbilt should be paid. For petitioner to be 
labelled as negligent for not "direct[ing] municipal officials [to 
direct municipal officers] to inquire on" Markbilt's demands "prior to 
release of" Legal Officer Deveza's opinion is, with respect, 
nonsensical. Again, the fact is that Legal Officer Deveza gave his 
imprimatur to the payment. 
 Moreover, the 
ponencia
 utterly
 fails to even state what circumstances it is referring to that should 
have "alerted [petitioner] to exercise a higher degree of 
circumspection."
[98]
 
 In this regard, petitioner's reliance on 
Arias v. Sandiganbayan
[99]
 is very
 apropos
: 
  


 We would be setting a bad precedent if a head of office plagued 
by all too common problems â dishonest or negligent subordinates, 
overwork, multiple assignments or positions, or plain incompetence â is 
suddenly swept into a conspiracy conviction simply because he did not 
personally examine every single detail, painstakingly trace every step 
from inception, and investigate the motives of every person involved in a
 transaction before affixing his signature as the final approving 
authority. 


 x x x x


 
We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have probed 
records, inspected documents, received procedures, and questioned 
persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly sized office 
could personally
 do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature. 
The
 Court would be asking for the impossible. All heads of offices have to 
rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith 
of those prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations.

 If a department secretary entertains important visitors, the auditor is
 not ordinarily expected to call the restaurant about the amount of the 
bill, question each guest whether he was present at the luncheon, 
inquire whether the correct amount of food was served, and otherwise 
personally

 look into the reimbursement voucher's accuracy, propriety, and 
sufficiency. There has to be some added reason why he should examine 
each voucher in such detail. Any executive head of even
 small
 
government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers 
that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, 
memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through 
his hands. The number in bigger offices or departments is even more 
appalling. 


 There should be other grounds than the mere signature or 
approval appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and 
conviction.
[100]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics in the original) 




Likewise, in 
Sistoza v. Desierto
,
[101]
 the Court held: 
  


 There is no question on the need to ferret out and expel public 
officers whose acts make bureaucracy synonymous with graft in the public
 eye, and to eliminate systems of government acquisition procedures 
which covertly ease corrupt practices. But the remedy is not to indict 
and jail every person who happens to have signed a piece of document or 
had a hand in implementing routine government procurement, nor does the 
solution fester in the indiscriminate use of the conspiracy theory which
 may sweep into jail even the most innocent ones. To say the least, this
 response is excessive and would simply engender catastrophic 
consequences since prosecution will likely not end with just one civil 
servant but must, logically, include like an unsteady streak of dominoes
 the department secretary, bureau chief, commission chairman, agency 
head, and all chief auditors who, if the flawed reasoning were followed,
 are equally culpable for every crime arising from disbursements they 
sanction.


 
Stretching the argument further, 
if a public officer were 
to personally examine every single detail, painstakingly trace every 
step from inception, and investigate the motives of every person 
involved in a transaction before affixing his signature as the final 
approving authority, if only to avoid prosecution, our bureaucracy would
 end up with public managers doing nothing else but superintending 
minute details in the acts of their subordinates
.
 x x x
[102]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 Thus, there being no "irregularity" in the CAF, or any other 
patent irregularity in the transaction that had gone through the proper 
procedure as certified by the officers concerned before petitioner 
signed the disbursement voucher, as well as the fact that petitioner 
relied on a legal opinion, it is erroneous to insist that petitioner is 
guilty of gross inexcusable negligence, more so that he acted in bad 
faith. 
  




There were no unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference given to Markbilt nor any undue injury to the government
 






The 
ponencia
, in upholding the Sandiganbayan ruling that the prosecution was able to prove the element of undue injury to the government,
[103]

 refers solely to the absence of a GPPB approval and the absence of a 
determination by NEDA as to the propriety of the claim for price 
escalation.
[104]


 However, as previously discussed, the evidence unequivocally 
established that: (1) there was indeed an appropriation to pay for the 
contract price escalation; (2) the alleged non-compliance with Section 
61 of R.A. No. 9184 did not pertain to petitioner; and (3) even assuming
 that compliance with Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184 pertained to 
petitioner, the same law does not penalize the alleged irregularity.
[105]
 Finally, there is no question that work was actually done by Markbilt. 

 To still hold that petitioner gave unwarranted benefits, advantage or 
preference to Markbilt is to contradict established jurisprudence 
because 
it was not proven that petitioner acted with corrupt intent
. In 
Martel
, the Court held: 
  


 x x x As its title implies, and as what can be gleaned from the 
deliberations of Congress, R.A. 3019 was crafted as an anti-graft and 
corruption measure. At the heart of the acts punishable under R.A. 3019 
is 
corruption
. As explained by one of the sponsors of the law, Senator Arturo M. Tolentino, "[w]hile we are trying to penalize, 
the main idea of the bill is graft and corrupt practices.
 x x x Well, 
the idea of graft is the one emphasized.
" Graft 	entails 	the 	acquisition 	of 	gain in 
dishonest ways.
[106]
 (Italics and underscoring in the original)




 Further, as I stated in my Concurring Opinion in 
Villarosa
:
  


 
Hence, in saying that a public officer gave "unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference," it is not enough that the benefits, 
advantage, or preference was obtained in transgression of laws, rules, 
and regulations. Such benefits must have been given by the public 
officer to the private party with 
corrupt intent, a dishonest design, or some unethical interest
. This is in alignment with the spirit of RA 3019, which centers on the concept of graft.


 I recognize that this is not the understanding under the current state of jurisprudence. Jurisprudence has defined the term "
unwarranted
" as simply lacking adequate or official support; unjustified; unauthorized or without justification or adequate reason. "
Advantage
"
 means a more favorable or improved position or condition; benefit, 
profit or gain of any kind; benefit from some course of action. "
Preference
"
 signifies priority or higher evaluation or desirability; choice or 
estimation above another. The term "private party" may be used to refer 
to persons other than those holding public office, which may either be a
 private person or a public officer acting in a private capacity to 
protect his personal interest. 


 Thus, under current jurisprudence, in order to be found guilty 
for giving any unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference, it is 
enough that the public officer has given an unauthorized or unjustified 
favor or benefit to another, in the exercise of his official, 
administrative or judicial functions. By giving any private party 
unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference, 
damage is not required
.
 It suffices that the public officer has given unjustified favor or 
benefit to another in the exercise of his official functions. Proof of 
the extent or quantum of damage is not even essential, it being 
sufficient that the injury suffered or benefit received could be 
perceived to be substantial enough and not merely negligible. 


 I respectfully submit, and evidently the majority agrees, that 
it is high time for the Court to revisit this line of reasoning. 


 
The foregoing understanding of "unwarranted benefit, 
advantage, or preference" is too broad that every single misstep 
committed by public officers that result in benefits to private parties 
falls under the definition and would thus possibly be criminally 
punishable. Every little error	no matter how minor- would satisfy the 
fourth element as the threshold is simply that the benefit be 
"unjustified," "unauthorized," or "without justification."
 For 
instance, a contract awarded in good faith based on an interpretation of
 the law that would later on be judicially declared incorrect would be 
sufficient basis for affirming the existence of the fourth element, 
which may lead to the incarceration of a public officer simply because a
 private party received a benefit "without justification," yet was 
revealed to be so only in hindsight. 


 While it is true that public office is a public trust, the Court
 is called upon to likewise play its part in not interpreting the laws 
to effectively be a disincentive to individuals in joining the public 
service. 
It is simply absurd to criminally punish every minute 
mistake that incidentally caused a benefit to private parties even when 
these acts were not done with 
corrupt intent
.
 


 In the instant case, for example, Villarosa's act of issuing the
 extraction permits was motivated, not by any corrupt intent to favor 
one operator over another or to unduly receive any pecuniary benefit. 
Based on the evidence, his actuations were simply based on his honest 
belief that he had the authority to issue the permits. To be sure, the 
evidence in fact shows that all the pertinent taxes and fees in the 
issuance of the said permits were collected, creating revenue for the 
provincial government, the municipality, and the barangay. No pecuniary 
benefit went to the wrong person or entity â
 in other words, the evidence clearly showed that no graft and corruption actually transpired
.
[107]
 (Emphasis supplied and italics in the original) 




 To show that petitioner did not act with corrupt intent, a 
dishonest design, or some unethical interest, the following arguments of
 petitioner are very telling: 
  


 The Contract Agreement between Markbilt Construction and the 
Municipality of Daet x x x contained a provision of price escalation. 


 Invoking such provision, Markbilt Construction sent five (5) 
demand letters, from 2005 to 2008, for the payment of its price 
escalation claim x x x. Plaintiff's witness, Jesus R. Reblora, Jr., 
confirmed the existence of these demand letters. 


 With its previous demand letters being ignored by the 
municipality, Markbilt Construction sent another demand letter dated 7 
February 2008 x x x charging the municipality a fifteen percent (15%) 
interest per annum on its P5.2 million price escalation claim and 
threatening to sue the municipality. 


 
Tito Sarion did not want the municipal government to be 
dragged into an expensive lawsuit so he referred these demand letters to
 the Sangguniang Bayan
. 


 
The Sanggunian acted upon the claim made by Markbilt Construction by enacting an appropriation
. The payment did not even pass through Tito Sarion, who did not receive any benefit or commission from such payment. 


 
His act did not cause undue injury to the Municipality of Daet. In fact, such act redounded to its benefit.
 


 Only then that the Disbursement Voucher x x x was prepared by 
the Municipal Accountant who certified as to the existence of an 
allotment for the purpose and the completeness of supporting documents. 
In same Disbursement Voucher, the Municipal Treasurer certified on the 
availability of funds. Only after such certifications by the said 
municipal officers did Tito Sarion, as Municipal Mayor, sign the 
Disbursement Voucher.
[108]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 Thus, in the instant case, similar to 
Villarosa
 and 
Martel
, it cannot be said that petitioner acted with corrupt intent. 
  
 As previously discussed, petitioner relied in good faith on 
the acts of the other municipal officers who verified the regularity of 
the transaction. 
In fact, the Sandiganbayan concededly admitted that petitioner did 
not
 act in bad faith because the evidence presented by the prosecution was 
not

 sufficient to support a conclusion that petitioner was motivated by 
ill-will or dishonest purpose in paying Markbilt's demand for payment of
 contract price escalation having relied on the legal opinion issued by 
the municipal legal officer
.
[109]


 The Sandiganbayan further held that petitioner relied on the legal
 opinion issued by the municipal legal officer which states: (a) P.D. 
No. 1594 is the applicable law in connection with Markbilt's claim for 
price escalation; (b) the escalation prices were allegedly computed in 
accordance with the Implementing Rules and Regulations of P.D. No. 1594;
 and (c) there was no reason to refuse payment for price escalation.
[110]
 
In
 the face of all these, as recognized by the Sandiganbayan itself, it is
 clear that petitioner was justified in his acts by his honest belief 
that there were no irregularities in the payment of the escalation 
prices to Markbilt
. 
 In sum, the second and third 
elements of a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 do not exist. 
This warrants the acquittal of petitioner for the charge of violation of
 Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. 
 II. 

    Malversation of Public Funds or Property
 
    under Article 217 of the RPC


 Article 217 of the RPC defines and penalizes Malversation of Public Funds as follows: 
  


 Art. 217. 
Malversation of public funds or property
. â 
Presumption of malversation
.âAny
 public officer who, by reason of the duties of his office, is 
accountable for public funds or property, shall appropriate the same, or
 shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, through abandonment or 
negligence, shall permit any other person to take such public funds or 
property, wholly or partially, or shall otherwise be guilty of the 
misappropriation or malversation of such funds or property x x x[.]




 In order to convict an accused for Malversation of Public Funds, 
the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following 
elements: (a) that the offender is a public officer; (b) that he had 
custody or control of funds or property by reason of the duties of his 
office; (c) that those funds or property were public funds or property 
for which he was accountable; and (d) that he appropriated, took, 
misappropriated or consented, or through abandonment or negligence, 
permitted another person to take them. 
 From the earlier disquisition, it is clear that the fourth element was shown to not exist.

 In fine, it simply cannot be said that petitioner permitted Markbilt to
 take the P1,000,000.00 "through abandonment or negligence." 
 In this regard, the 
ponencia

 holds that petitioner, through gross inexcusable negligence, permitted 
Markbilt to receive partial payment of price escalation despite not 
being entitled thereto.
[111]
 The 
ponencia
 rules: 
  


 x x x Thus, when petitioner signed the disbursement voucher in 
favor of Markbilt, in effect, he certified to the correctness of the 
entries therein; and warranted that the expenses incurred were necessary
 and lawful, the supporting documents were complete, and the 
availability of cash therefor. By approving the disbursement voucher and
 signing the Landbank check payable to Markbilt, 
despite the absence of funding and failure to comply with the requirements of Section 61, R.A. No. 9184
,
 he permitted Markbilt to received (sic) public funds to which it is not
 entitled. Otherwise, the petitioner's approval and signature in respect
 facilitated the illegal release of funds, constitutive of the act of 
malversation.
[112]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Again, it is without doubt that there was a CAF; meaning that there was a funding.
[113]
 

 It has also already been shown that the obligation to secure the 
documents required under Section 61 of R.A. No. 9184 did not pertain to 
petitioner, but to Architect Itturalde for Aceron.
[114]
 As well, it was established that the acts of petitioner cannot be said to have been with a total want of care. 
 With the absence of the fourth element of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds, petitioner should be acquitted. 
 
Presumption of Innocence

 On a final note, I would like to stress the constitutionally enshrined 
principle of presumption of innocence, fleshed out by procedural rules 
which place on the prosecution the burden of proving that an accused is 
guilty of the offense charged by proof beyond reasonable doubt.
[115]

 Absolute guarantee of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict a 
person of a criminal charge but there must, at least, be moral certainty
 on each element essential to constitute the offense and on the 
responsibility of the offender.
[116]

 Thus, the prosecution has the primordial duty to present its case with 
clarity and persuasion, to the end that conviction becomes the only 
logical and inevitable conclusion.
[117]
 

 In the instant case, since the prosecution failed to prove beyond 
reasonable doubt the guilt of petitioner for violation of Section 3(e) 
of R.A. No. 3019 and Malversation of Public Funds, the presumption of 
innocence of petitioner must be upheld. 
 Thus, I respectfully dissent. I accordingly vote that petitioner be acquitted of the crimes charged.
