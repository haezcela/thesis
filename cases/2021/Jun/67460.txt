INTER-ISLAND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC., REPRESENTED BY JESSE TAN TING, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, ELEVENTH DIVISION (FORMER TENTH DIVISION) AND CHAM Q. IBAY, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




HERNANDO, J.:


Challenged in this petition
[1]
 are the September 12, 2008
[2]
 and February 6, 2009
[3]

 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 103148 which
 dismissed petitioner Inter-Island Information Systems, Inc. 
(Inter-Island) petition for 
certiorari
 for failing to comply with the CA's June 27, 2008 Resolution
[4]

 directing it to furnish the appellate court the present and complete 
address of both respondent Cham Q. Ibay (Ibay) and his counsel for the 
purpose of sending court notices and processes. 

The Antecedents
 


Inter-Island is an internet service provider which hired Ibay on 
January 20, 2003 as a technical support in its Network Operations Center
 (NOC). Into seven (7) months of his employment, Ibay received 
Memorandum No. 03-08-08 dated August 20, 2003
[5]

 issued by a certain Scott Lam (Lam) informing him of his inclusion in 
the Q Linux Schedule of Training. However, in a revised Memorandum No. 
03-09-01 dated September 2, 2003
[6]

 signed by Lam, Ibay was delisted as one of the trainees. When Ibay 
discussed his exclusion with Marianne Rosellon (Rosellon), NOC's 
Technical Head, Rosellon explained that he was delisted from the said 
training due to the expiration of his contract as would be further 
explained to him by the Human Resource Department.
[7]
 


Two days later, Lam talked to Ibay over the phone urging the latter 
to submit his resignation letter so that Jesse Tan Ting (Ting), the 
Human Resource Manager, would not get angry at him. Lam further said 
that in exchange for his submission of resignation letter, Inter-Island 
would issue a Certificate of Employment which he could use as reference 
for his application in other companies. Lam also threatened to block his
 applications with other companies should he refuse to resign.
[8]
 


On October 3, 2003, Ting allegedly summoned respondent to his office 
and told him to submit his resignation letter. However, when respondent 
refused, Ting told him 
"Kung ayaw na namin sa inyo ay wala kayong magagawa
."
[9]

 On October 31, 2003, respondent was allegedly prevented from entering 
Inter-Island's premises. Hence, respondent filed a complaint for illegal
 dismissal.
[10]
 


On the other hand, Inter-Island alleged that during respondent's 
tenure in the company, he incurred several infractions. He was 
reprimanded for excessive use of company telephone as per Memorandum 
dated March 18, 2003.
[11]
 On 
March 29, 2003, respondent tendered his resignation which was not 
accepted by the company. Petitioner further averred that respondent's 
work continued to deteriorate until he abandoned his work. Respondent 
was not terminated and was, in fact, ordered to return to work.
[12]


Ruling of the Labor Arbiter (LA):
 


On July 29, 2005, the LA rendered a Decision
[13]

 reinstating Ibay to his former position with full payment of his 
backwages which as of July 31, 2005 already amounted to P159,640.00. The
 dispositive portion of the LA judgment reads: 




WHEREFORE, all the foregoing premises being considered, judgment is 
hereby rendered ordering the respondents to reinstate the complainant to
 his former position and to pay his full backwages which as of July 31, 
2005 already amount to P159,640.00.


SO ORDERED.
[14]


The LA found respondent's assertion of facts to be more credible than
 petitioner's. The fact that there was a scheduled training in 2003 
which included respondent was fully substantiated. However, petitioner 
failed to justify why respondent was delisted from joining the training.
 Moreover, although petitioner claimed that it ordered respondent to 
return to work, the company had not seen fit to notify respondent of its
 return-to-work order. Hence, the LA ruled in favor of respondent and 
ordered his reinstatement with full backwages.
[15]


Ruling of the National Labor

Relations Commission (NLRC):


 On October 31, 2007, the NLRC dismissed the company's appeal for lack of merit and affirmed the LA's July 29, 2005 Decision,
[16]
 to wit: 


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISSED 
for lack of merit, and the Decision of Labor Arbiter Jose G. De Vera 
dated July 29, 2005 is hereby AFFIRMED.


 SO ORDERED.
[17]


The NLRC ruled that respondent was illegally dismissed. His filing of
 the complaint barely seven days after he was allegedly dismissed showed
 his intention not to sever the employer-employee relationship. His 
failure to report to work was justified as he was prevented from 
entering Inter-Island's premises. His subsequent filing of a complaint 
for illegal dismissal belied any suggestion that he was abandoning his 
work.
[18]


Moreover, respondent's refusal to return to work after the filing of 
the complaint was justified. The offer to return to work was belatedly 
made by petitioner's counsel in the company's position paper and 
verbally during the mandatory conference without any written document 
signed by any company representative. Also, the offer was premised on 
the respondent's alleged abandonment.
[19]


The NLRC further ruled that the lack of a notice of termination does not 
per se

 prove that there was no actual dismissal. In this case, respondent was 
repeatedly asked to submit a letter of resignation which implied that no
 notice of termination was ever issued. Petitioner failed to comply with
 the substantive and procedural requirements of due process to further 
refute respondent's claim for illegal dismissal.
[20]


Petitioner Inter-Island's motion for reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in its January 30, 2008 Resolution.
[21]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:


Hence, petitioner filed a petition for 
certiorari
 before the CA. On April 30, 2008, the appellate court issued a Resolution
[22]

 directing Ibay to file a comment within ten (10) days from receipt. 
However, the Resolution sent to Ibay's counsel was returned unserved.
[23]


On June 27, 2008, the CA issued a Resolution
[24]

 directing petitioner to furnish the court within ten (10) days from 
notice the present and complete address of both respondent Ibay and his 
counsel. However, petitioner InterÂ­ Island failed to comply.
[25]


Thus, on September 12, 2008, the CA rendered its assailed Resolution
[26]

 dismissing the petition for failure of petitioner to comply with its 
June 27, 2008 Resolution pursuant to Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of 
Court.


A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioner which was denied by the CAin its February 6, 2009 Resolution.
[27]
 


Hence, this petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65. 


Issue


The sole issue raised for resolution of this Court is:


Whether or not the appellate court committed grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in dismissing 
the petition for certiorari due to petitioner's failure to comply with 
the CA's June 27, 2008 Resolution directing petitioner to furnish the 
appellate court with the complete address of both respondent Ibay and 
his counsel as per Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court.
[28]


Petitioner argues that lawyers are obliged to adopt a system whereby 
they can receive judicial notices and to notify the court in case of 
changes in their address. Petitioners maintain that Ibay and his counsel
 failed to notify the NLRC or the LA of their new address. Petitioner's 
counsel exerted effort to comply with the directive of the appellate 
court but to no avail. Petitioner argues that the failure of respondent 
and his counsel to notify the court oftheir new address should not be 
taken against them for it is the duty of the opposing counsel to inform 
the court of any change in his or her address.
[29]


Petitioner maintains that respondent Ibay abandoned his work and was 
not illegally dismissed. His exclusion from the training schedule in 
2003 was not an indication that he was being dismissed. Ibay seriously 
violated the rules and regulations of the company due to his unexplained
 absences on several occasions which constituted abandonment. He 
intentionally abandoned his work and left to work abroad during the 
conciliation conference and prior to the filing of his position paper 
before the LA.
[30]


Petitioner insists that it had no intention to terminate the services
 of respondent Ibay. During the mandatory conference on January 12, 
2004, the company ordered Ibay to report back to work. This offer was 
reiterated in petitioner's position paper dated February 5, 2004 and in 
its Rejoinder dated May 12, 2004. However, respondent did not comply 
with the said orders
[31]
.


 Petitioner claims that respondent did not report back despite 
several directives because he was about to leave for Macau, China in 
January 2004 which had been processed since November 2003. He had all 
the intention to abandon his work as manifested by his overt acts.
[32]
 


On the other hand, respondent Ibay failed to file a comment on the petition. In a December 1, 2010 Resolution,
[33]

 the Court required Ibay to show cause why he should not be held in 
contempt for such failure and to comply with the directive to file 
comment. On June 1, 2011, respondent lbay was fined P1,000 for failure 
to comply with the show cause Resolution dated December 1, 2010.
[34]
 


In a March 12, 2012 Resolution,
[35]

 the Court declared respondent guilty of contempt of court and ordered 
his arrest. However, he was not found in his stated address. On November
 12, 2012, the Court resolved
[36]

 to require the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to submit the 
current and complete address of Atty. David D. Erro (Atty. Erro), 
respondent Ibay's counsel of record. On January 11, 2013, the IBP 
informed the Court of Atty. Erro's complete and current address.
[37]
 However, despite resending the notices and resolutions to Atty. Erro's address, the latter failed to comply.


On October 16, 2018, Atty. Jobert I. Pahilga (Atty. Pahilga) of Erro Pahilga Law Offices filed before this Court a 
Compliance with Notice of New Address and Motion
.
[38]

 He reasoned that Atty. Erro formed the Erro Pahilga Law Offices 
together with him as partner. Atty. Erro is presently the undersecretary
 of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and that his position forced
 him to go on leave from the law offices.


On March 6, 2020, respondent Ibay, through his counsel Atty. Pahilga, filed a 
Manifestation and Comment/Opposition to the Petition with Notice of New Address
.
[39]
 He argues that petitioner availed of the wrong remedy when it filed a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65. He alleges that a petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 is available only when the court or quasi-judicial body 
acted with grave abuse of discretion and that there is no plain, speedy,
 and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. In this case, 
respondent maintains that the appellate court did not commit grave abuse
 of discretion and that petitioner had plain, speedy and adequate remedy
 which is a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45.
[40]

 Respondent claims that petitioner filed the instant petition under Rule
 65 because the period to file the petition for review under Rule 45, 
which is 15 days from receipt of the challenged decision or resolution, 
had already lapsed. Respondent notes that petitioner received the 
February 6, 2009 Resolution of the CA on February 16, 2009. However, it 
filed its petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 only on April 21,
 2009 or 64 days after receipt by its counsel of the assailed CA 
Resolution. Thus, petitioner lost its right to appeal. A 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 is not a remedy or substitute for a lost appeal. Nonetheless, even assuming that petitioner could avail of the 
certiorari

 under Rule 65, the same was filed out of time as it was filed 64 days 
from receipt of the February 6, 2009 Resolution, clearly beyond the 
60-day period within which to file the petition.
[41]


 Moreover, respondent contends that the CA correctly dismissed the 
petition when the petitioner failed to comply with the September 12, 
2008 Resolution of theCA to furnish the court of the present and 
complete address of the respondent and his counsel. The dismissal of the
 petition was due to the neglect and absolute non-compliance for an 
unreasonable length of time by the petitioner with the order or 
resolution of the CA.


Finally, respondent claims that a thorough reading of the instant 
petition would readily show that it is a mere rehash of the arguments 
which were already passed upon by the NLRC. 


Our Ruling


After due consideration, we resolve to dismiss the petition.


Wrong mode of appeal.


 Section 1 of Rule 45 provides that when a party desires to appeal by 
certiorari

 from a judgment, final order or resolution of the CA, he or she may 
file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on 
certiorari

 which shall raise only questions oflaw. Clearly, the assailed September
 12, 2008 and February 6, 2009 Resolutions of the appellate court may be
 elevated to this Court via a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 on pure questions of law. However, as can be gleaned from the records, the petitioner availed of a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 instead. It is settled that an extraordinary remedy of 
certiorari
 will not lie if there is a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
[42]
 as in this case. Petitioner should have availed of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 and not a petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 as its petition was dismissed by the appellate court 
based on Section 3 of Rule 117 which is an adjudication on the merits 
and not merely an interlocutory order.


Nonetheless, it must be clarified that for purposes of discussion, 
the petition was filed within the 60-day reglementary period under Rule 
65, contrary to the contention of the respondent that it was filed out 
of time or 64 days from receipt of the CA's February 6, 2009 Resolution 
on February 16, 2009. The records clearly show that the petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 was filed on April 16, 2009 which is within the 60-day reglementary period to file a petition.


Despite the foregoing, We are inclined to dismiss the petition. The 
right to appeal is a mere statutory privilege and must be exercised only
 in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of law.
[43]

 The perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period 
prescribed by law is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional and 
failure of the party to conform to the rules regarding appeal will 
render the judgment final and executory.
[44]


 Although we have applied a liberal application of the rules of 
procedure in a number of cases, this can be invoked only in proper cases
 and under justifiable causes and circumstances.
[45]

 Petitioner failed to cite any reasonable cause to justify 
non-compliance with the rules for its availment of a wrong remedy. In 
fact, it resorted to a wrong mode of appeal by filing a petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 instead of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule
 45. Whatever may be the reason for taking such option, the petitioner 
failed to apprise this Court. Its petition, invoking grave abuse of 
discretion on the appellate court, unmistakably confirms that it 
intended to file a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 to assail the September 12, 2008 and February 6, 2009 Resolutions. However, one cannot simply substitute 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 for a lost remedy of appeal as they are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive. 


No abandonment on the part of Ibay; he was illegally dismissed

by the company.


Even granting that petitioner availed of the correct remedy and that 
the same was filed within the reglementary period, the petition still 
warrants its dismissal. Although the appellate court's September 12, 
2008 and February 6, 2009 Resolutions did not delve on the issue of 
respondent Ibay's illegal dismissal, we deem it necessary to completely 
resolve and settle this issue considering the duty of the Court to 
consider and give due regard to everything on record relevant and 
material to the resolution of the issues presented. As can be gleaned 
from the records, respondent Ibay did not abandon his work in 
Inter-Island as in fact he immediately filed a complaint for illegal 
dismissal after he was prevented from entering the company premises. 
This only proves that respondent Ibay had no intention to sever his 
employer-employee relationship with Inter-Island.


 The contention that Ibay had applied to work abroad is not supported
 by evidence on record. Even if the same is true, Ibay's intent to earn a
 living during the pendency of the labor case should not be taken 
against him. Besides, even if he indeed applied for a new job abroad in 
November 2003, petitioner's illegal dismissal of respondent Ibay and the
 latter's subsequent filing of a complaint were 
fait accompli
, 
having already been accomplished in October 2003 or way before 
respondent Ibay's alleged application for work abroad.This cannot erase 
the fact that the company illegally dismissed its employee without just 
and authorized cause and prevented the latter from entering the company 
premises.


Further, petitioner's contention that it issued several 
return-to-work orders is without any factual basis. Petitioner's 
allegation that it ordered its worker to return to work during the 
mandatory conference on January 12, 2004, as reiterated in its position 
paper dated February 5, 2004 and in its Rejoinder dated May 12, 2004, 
were substantially refuted by Ibay who claimed non-receipt of 
petitioner's written notice to return to work.


As a final note, the obstinate failure of respondent lbay and his 
counsel of record before the LA and the NLRC, Atty. Erro, to comply with
 the appellate court and this Court's numerous directives has not 
escaped Our notice. While it is true that Ibay's cause was ultimately 
proven to be meritorious, this fact does not excuse nor justify Ibay's 
or Atty. Erro's repeated failure to comply with the orders of the Court.
 In fact, this case has dragged on for 11 years since the filing of the 
petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 before this Court in 2009 
due to the mere fact that Atty. Erro could not be located to be served 
the notices of this Court. Even respondent Ibay was not found in his 
address on record during the service of the warrant of arrest for 
contempt.


Although we recognize Atty. Erro's appointment as undersecretary of 
DAR during the pendency of this case and his inability to continue 
private law practice because of conflict of interest, this does not 
excuse him from complying with his responsibility to update the Court 
and the IBP of his current and complete address and to his clients. 
Clearly, petitioner cannot be faulted when it relied on the information 
of Atty. Erro's address as stated in his pleadings filed before the LA 
and NLRC. His failure to withdraw as counsel of record of respondent 
lbay in this case or even the proper tum-over of the same to his partner
 Atty. Pahilga undoubtedly shows negligence on his part.


As a consequence, this Court imposes upon Atty. Erro an additional 
P5,000 for his non-compliance with this Court's June 10, 2009 Resolution
 and the other Resolutions subsequent thereto. On the other hand, 
respondent Ibay's lack of enthusiasm towards the outcome of this case 
for his failure to inform the court of his counsel of record's 
incapability to represent him warrants the imposition as well of a fine 
of P5,000. 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DISMISSED
. The September 12, 2008 and February 6, 2009 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 103148 are hereby 
AFFIRMED
.


Respondent Cham Q. Ibay and Atty. David D. Erro are 
ORDERED

 to PAY within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision an additional
 fine of P5,000.00 each for their repeated failure to heed the 
directives of this Court and are 
STERNLY WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.
