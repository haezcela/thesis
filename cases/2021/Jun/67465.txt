ARMANDO H. DE JESUS, PETITIONER, VS. INTER-ORIENT MARITIME ENTERPRISES, INC., INTERÂ­ORIENT MARITIME ENT., INC. LIBERIA, GRIGOROUSSA I MARIN'E S.A.-MONROVIA LIBERIA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




HERNANDO, J.:


Before this Court is a 
Petition for Review on Certiorari
[1]
 filed by herein petitioner Armando H. De Jesus (De Jesus) assailing the November 23, 2010
[2]
 and August 8, 2012
[3]
 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB-SP. No. 05114 which dismissed the 
Petition for Certiorari
[4]
 of De Jesus due to several technical infirmities.

Factual Antecedents:


 De Jesus exclusively worked as a seafarer on board the ocean-going 
vessels of Inter-Orient Maritime Enterprises Inc. (Inter-Orient) for 20 
years prior to the present controversy. For every employment contract he
 has entered with Inter-Orient, De Jesus underwent the requisite 
pre-employment medical examination (PEME) and was consistently declared 
"fit for sea service."
[5]
 


On July 4, 2005, De Jesus executed another employment contract
[6]

 withI nter-Orient, on behalf of its principal, Inter-Orient Maritime 
Ent., Inc-Liberia-Grigoroussa I- Maritime S.A, as Second Mate on board 
MIT Grigoroussa I, for nine months.
[7]
 


On his seventh month on board the vessel and while it was docked in 
the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Egypt, De Jesus felt severe chest
 pains and had difficulty breathing. The master of the vessel then 
instructed that De Jesus be brought to the nearest hospital. On March 
28, 2006 he was admitted at the Suez General Hospital in Egypt (United 
Doctors Hospital) where he was diagnosed with Acute Extensive Myocardial
 Infarction.
[8]


On April 7, 2006, Dr. Edward Youssef of United Doctors Hospital 
cleared De Jesus to travel by plane back to the Philippines. However, he
 was declared unfit for physical work and was advised to immediately 
undergo a coronary angiography.
[9]


 Upon his arrival in the Philippines on April 12, 2006, De Jesus 
proceeded directly to the office of the respondent company. He inquired 
about his unpaid salaries and was told that he needed to sign a 
Quitclaim before his salaries could be released. Due to exhaustion and 
desperation brought about by his medical condition, he signed the 
Quitclaim without fully understanding its consequences.
[10]


 On the next day, April 13, 2006, De Jesus had himself examined by a 
specialist from YGEIA Medical Clinic upon the advice and referral of 
respondent company. It was confirmed that he had Myocardial Infarction 
and that he must undergo rehabilitation and continuous medication. No 
medical report was given to him. He then requested to have his treatment
 conducted in Cebu, his hometown, under the supervision of the company's
 accredited doctors. Inter-Orient agreed to the arrangement provided De 
Jesus sign a letter stating that he will hold the company free and 
harmless from any liability.
[11]
 


On April 18, 2006, representatives from Inter-Orient accompanied De 
Jesus to the National Labor Relations Commission in Quezon City to sign a
 number of Inter-Orient-prepared documents as pre-requisite for the 
processing and release of his bonuses and allowances. Among the 
documents which were executed by the parties were: 




a) Computerized NLRC-NCR Complaint form
[12]
 for non-payment of wages, overtime pay, vacation pay and sick leave pay docketed as NLRC NCR OFW Case No. 06-04-011699-00;


 b) Quitclaim and Release submitted before the NLRC;
[13]


 c) Release of All Rights in Filipino and English versions;
[14]
 and


d) A pro-forma Motion to Dismiss. 
[15]




De Jesus received the amount of Five Thousand Seven Hundred FortyÂ­ Nine Dollars (US$5,749.00) upon signing the documents.




Accordingly, Labor Arbiter Jovencio LI. Mayor, Jr. issued an Order 
dated April 19, 2006 dismissing with prejudice the complaint docketed as
 NLRC NCR OFW Case No. 06-04-011699-00.
[16]


 Hence, on April 26, 2006, De Jesus returned to Cebu and continued 
his treatment under the supervision of Dr. Marie Geraldine SJ. Lim of 
Cebu Doctor's University Hospital.
[17]

 All expenses for his treatment were for his own account since 
respondent company informed him that he already received all that was 
due him
[18]
 


On February 12, 2007, De Jesus filed before the NLRC Regional 
Arbitration Branch in Cebu a complaint docketed as NLRC RAB VII OFW Case
 No. 02-0014-2007 for disability benefits and sickness allowance under 
the POEA-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) and for moral and 
exemplary damages.
[19]


 Inter-Orient filed a Motion to Dismiss on grounds of 
res judicata

 in view of the previous dismissal of the similar complaint earlier 
filed by De Jesus against the respondent company. In addition, 
Inter-Orient pointed out that De Jesus had already executed a quitclaim 
and release in the prior case docketed as NCR OFW Case No. 
06-04-0ll699-00.
[20]
 


Ruling of the Labor Arbiter:
 


The Arbiter denied Inter-Orient's Motion to Dismiss on the ground 
that De Jesus signed the release and quitclaim without the aid of a 
counsel and the consideration contained therein was unconscionable. 
Moreover, he found as irregular the filing on the same day of the 
complaint and the Motion to Dismiss in NLRC NCR OFW Case No. 
06-04-011699-00.
[21]
 


The dispositive portion of the Order reads: 




WHEREFORE
, the foregoing considered, the Motion To Dismiss 
is DENIED. This case is therefore, set for another conference on May 23,
 2007 at 2:00 P.M.
[22]


SO ORDERED.
[23]




Inter-Orient appealed the denial of its Motion to Dismiss with the 
NLRC but it was denied by the labor tribunal for being a prohibited 
pleading. The subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was likewise denied 
for the same reason.
[24]




Hence, the parties were required to submit their position papers. De 
Jesus alleged that his illness, i.e. cardiovascular disease, which he 
acquired during his employment with respondent company, was compensable 
considering that it was listed as an occupational disease under Section 
32-A of the POEA SEC.
[25]
 
Also, the Quitclaim was void since the consideration therein was 
unconscionable and it was signed without the assistance of counsel.'

Moreover, the complaint, quitclaim, and the motion to dismiss were all 
executed on the same day, a clear departure from the usual process in 
labor complaints, and proof of the irregularity in the execution of the 
quitclaim. As such, the dismissal of N'LRC NCR OFW Case No. 
06-04-011699-00 should not be considered as bar to his subsequent claim 
of disability benefits from respondent company.
[26]




Meanwhile, Inter-Orient reiterated its arguments in the Motion to 
Dismiss that De Jesus' illness was not compensable because he failed to 
prove that it was work-related or work-aggravated. Furthermore, De Jesus
 executed a Quitclaim with full consent and comprehension, thus he 
cannot renege from its terms. Inter-Orient insisted that the amount of 
Five Thousand Seven Hundred Forty-Nine Dollars (US$5,749.00) can hardly 
be considered unconscionably low.
[27]




In a Decision
[28]
 dated February 25, 2009, the Labor Arbiter found in favor of De Jesus. The dispositive portion of the judgment reads:




WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, judgment is 
hereby rendered directing the Respondents to jointly and solidarily pay 
complainant the following:


 
 
Permanent Disability Benefits 
 
US$60,000.00
 
 
 
Sickness Allowance
 
US$ 3,200.00
 
 
 
Less: Cash Advanced
 
US$ 5,749.00
 
 
 
 
US$57,451.00
 
 
 
Add: 10% Attorney's Fee
 
US$ 5.745.10
 
 
 
Total
 
US$63,196.10
 
 


SO ORDERED.
[29]




The Labor Arbiter found De Jesus' Quitclaim to be invalid since the 
consideration was unconscionably low and was entered by De Jesus without
 the aid of counsel. There was umeasonable, irregular and apparent haste
 in the execution of the complaint, motion to dismiss and quitclaim all 
in one day. The arbiter found it unbelievable for De Jesus to have 
prepared the subject documents all in one day, particularly as they 
pertained to the release of all his rights. Moreover, the Affidavit of 
the Reader/Interpreter/Translator was not acknowledged before a Notary 
Public. Thus, the Quitclaim could not be considered as having validly 
extinguished all ofDe Jesus' claims.


The Arbiter also found that De Jesus' illness is compensable. 
Inasmuch as he suffered a heart attack while on board the vessel, the 
presumption is that it is work-related and the employer has the burden 
of proof to show otherwise.


 The arbiter thus granted De Jesus permanent disability benefits, 
sickness allowance, and attorney's fees. The amount that he earlier 
received from respondents was treated as cash advance.


 Inter-Orient appealed the Decision of the arbiter to the NLRC.


 
Ruling of the National Labor

Relations Commission:
 


The NLRC reversed and set aside the ruling of the Labor Arbiter and 
held that De Jesus' illness was not work-related. It accorded great 
weight to the Medical Report submitted by Inter-Orient.


 The labor tribunal further declared that for his illness to be 
compensable, it was incumbent upon De Jesus to prove that it was 
work-related. Section 20 of the POEA SEC mandates that for the illness 
to be compensable, the employee must be able to prove that the illness 
was acquired during the period of his employment or that it was at least
 aggravated thereat or was workÂ­related.
[30]
 De Jesus failed to present substantial evidence to prove the foregoing.


The dipositive portion of the September 30, 2009 NLRC Decision reads: 




WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the Labor Arbiter 
dated 25 February 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a NEW ONE is 
entered DISMISSING the complaint.


SO ORDERED.
[31]




Aggrieved, De Jesus filed a Motion for Reconsideration bt it was denied by the NLRC.
[32]
 He thus filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
[33]
 before the appellate court assailing the reversal by the NLRC of the LA's ruling.


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:


The appellate court, in its November 23, 2010 Resolution
[34]
 dismissed De Jesus' petition on the following grounds:




1) the petition does not show the date when petitioner received the 
copy of the assailed September 30, 2009 Decision, as well as when the 
motion for reconsideration was filed, in violation of Sec. 3, 2
nd
 paragraph, Rule 46 of the Revised Rules of Court;


 2) petitioner failed to furnish the public respondent, NLRC, with a copy of the petition, in violation of Sec. 3, 3
rd
 paragraph, Rule 46 of the Revised Rules of Court;


 3) the attached copy of the assailed Resolution is neither a 
duplicate original nor certified true copy of the same, in violation of 
Sec. 1, 2
nd
 paragraph, Rule 65, in relation to Sec. 3, 3
rd
 paragraph of Rule 46 of the Revised Rules of Court; and


4) the Verification and Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping does not 
bear the signature of petitioner, and its execution does not conform 
with the 2004 Notarial Rules.
[35]




De Jesus filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[36]

 citing inadvertence and submitted anew supporting documents. The Motion
 for Reconsideration was however denied by the appellate court in its 
August 8, 2012 Resolution.
[37]


Thus, De Jesus filed this Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 assailing the issuances of the CA. He raised the following-


Issues:




I.




The Court of Appeals erred when it dismissed outright petitioner's Petition for 
Certiorari
 and denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration based purely [on] procedural and technical grounds.




II.




The Court of Appeals erred when it failed to resolve the petitioner's Petition for 
Certiorari
 based on the merits thereof and reinstate the Decision of the Regional Arbitration Branch VII of Cebu dated February 25, 2009.
[38]




Petitioner's Arguments:


Petitioner submits that the appellate court erred in dismissing outright his Petition for 
Certiorari

 based purely on procedural and technical grounds. At the same time, he 
attached copies of the following: Certification from Cebu Central Post 
Office of the proof service to the NLRC of the Petition for Certiorari;
[39]
 signed Verification and Certificate of Forum Shopping dated June 4, 2010 notarized by Atty. Charter Antonio L. Tayurang;
[40]
 copy of the Notarial Commission of Atty. Tayurang;
[41]
 and Order dated December 11, 2009 granting Atty. Tayurang's notarial commission up to December 31, 2011.
[42]


Petitioner pleads that the case be resolved based on the merits.
[43]




He prays for the reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter's ruling 
declaring his illness as work-related in accordance with the POEA SEC 
and existing jurisprudence. He argues that the NLRC erred in giving full
 credit to the biased Medical Report of the company-designated doctor. 
Moreover, it was the employer who has the burden to show that his 
illness was not related to his work. Lastly, in cases where the evidence
 of the parties are in conflict with each other, it is incumbent upon 
the court to resolve the case in favor of the employee.
[44]




Respondents' Arguments:




Respondents, in their Comment,
[45]

 maintain that the petition should be dismissed due to the formal 
infirmities contained therein. Bare invocation of interest of justice is
 not a ground to automatically suspend procedural rules. Petitioner 
clearly failed to timely rectify the defects and ignored the 
requirements. Moreover, respondents aver that the case is already barred
 by 
res judicata
 considering the prior quitclaim voluntarily executed by De Jesus in favor of the respondents.
[46]


Our Ruling


Exceptions to Questions of Law:


The issues raised by petitioner are factual. It must be stressed that
 questions of fact are generally beyond the domain of a Petition for 
Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as it is limited to reviewing
 only questions of law. This Court is not a trier of facts and does not 
normally reassess the credibility and probative weight of the evidence 
of the parties and the findings and conclusions of the Arbiter, the NLRC
 and the CA.


 However, this rule admits of exceptions wherein this Court expands 
the coverage of a Petition for Review to include a resolution of 
questions of fact. One of those exceptions is when the lower court 
misapprehended facts or overlooked relevant facts which, if properly 
considered, would justifY a different conclusion.
[47]

 Such exception finds application in the instant case considering that 
the findings of facts and conclusion on relevant facts by the NLRC 
differed from that of the Arbiter. This Court is thus compelled to take a
 second look at the facts of the case to arrive at the correct 
conclusion. 


Substantial compliance to formal


requisites allowed; procedural

rules are mandatory but must

not frustrate the administration

of justice.


Heirs of Deleste v. Land Bank of the Philippines
[48]
 declared that:


 Time and again, this Court has held that a strict and rigid 
application of technicalities must be avoided if it tends to frustrate 
rather than promote substantial justice. As held in 
Sta. Ana v. Spouses Carpo
: 


Rules of procedure are merely tools designed to 
facilitate the attainment of justice. If the application of the Rules 
would tend to frustrate rather than to promote justice, it is always 
within our power to suspend the rules or except a particular case from 
their operation. Law and jurisprudence grant to courts the prerogative 
to relax compliance with the procedural rules, even the most mandatory 
in character, mindful of the duty to reconcile the need to put an end to
 litigation speedily and the parties' right to an opportunity to be 
heard.


 Our recent ruling in 
Tanenglian v. Lorenzo
 is instructive:


We have not been oblivious to or unmindful of the extraordinary 
situations that merit liberal application of the Rules, allowing us, 
depending on the circumstances, to set aside technical infirmities and 
give due course to the appeal. In cases where we dispense with the 
technicalities, we do not mean to undermine the force and effectivity of
 the periods set by law. In those rare cases where we did not 
stringently apply the procedural rules, there always existed a clear 
need to prevent the commission of a grave injustice. Our judicial system
 and the courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between 
the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every 
litigant be given the full opportur.Jty for the just and proper 
disposition of his cause.
[49]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)


In 
Durban Apartments Corporation v. Catacutan
,
[50]

 the appellate court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds for 
failure of the petitioner therein to attach a copy of the assailed 
decision but upon review by this Court, the case was decided on its 
merits. This Court held:


[I]n the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, the Court 
may disregard procedural lapses so that a case may be resolved on its 
merits. Rules of procedure should promote, not defeat, substantial 
justice. Hence, the Court may opt to apply the Rules liberally to 
resolve substantial issues raised by the parties.


It is well to remember that this Court, in not a few cases, has 
consistently held that cases shall be determined on the merits, after 
full opportunity to all parties for ventilation of their causes and 
defense, rather than on technicality or some procedural imperfections. 
In so doing, the ends of justice would be better served
. The 
dismissal of cases purely on technical grounds is frowned upon and the 
rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical 
sense, for they are adopted to help secure, not override, substantial 
justice, and thereby defeat their very ends. Indeed, rules of procedure 
are mere tools designed to expedite the resolution of cases and other 
matters pending in court. A strict and rigid application of the rules 
that would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than 
promote justice must be avoided.
[51]
 (Emphasis Ours; Citations omitted)


Following the above guidelines and upon Our review of the records, 
the outright dismissal of the case based on procedural defects alone was
 not proper.


Contrary to the findings of the appellate court, the petitioner 
attached a Certified True Copy (original stamped) of the NLRC Decision
[52]
 and only the Resolution
[53]

 denying his Motion for Reconsideration was a photocopy of the Certified
 True Copy of the issuance. The photocopied Resolution nonetheless bears
 the notation "Certified True Copy" as that found in the attached NLRC 
Decision. As to the alleged defect in the Affidavit of Service in the 
Petition for 
Certiorari
, although petitioner failed to attach the
 registry receipt as proof of service to NLRC, he nonetheless indicated 
the registry receipt no. in the affidavit.


Moreover, a second perusal of the Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation
[54]

 filed by the petitioner before the appellate court would show that 
there was a genuine attempt to rectify the procedural infirmities in the
 petition. Petitioner subsequently submitted several supporting 
documents together with the motion, to 
wit
: photocopy of the issuances of the NLRC with photocopy stamp of Certified True Copy;
[55]
 original Affidavit of Service indicating the Registry Receipt No.,
[56]

 Certification from Atty. Tayurang stating that the Verification and 
Certification of Non Forum Shopping was signed before him by the 
petitioner exhibiting his SSS ID and Seaman's Book,
[57]
 copies of the identification card,
[58]
 Notarial Commission of Atty. Tayurang including the Order granting his notarial commission; and Affidavit of Merit
[59]

 fully explaining the reason for the formal infirmities. These, taken 
together, should be considered as substantial compliance, enough to 
support the reinstatement of the Petition for 
Certiorari
 filed by the petitioner.


In addition, petitioner submitted before Us additional supporting documents
[60]
 that essentially satisfy the lacking requirements in the Petition for 
Certiorari
.


At this point, however, this Court admonishes petitioner's counsel 
for failing to strictly comply with the formal requirements vital in the
 resolution of the Petition for 
Certiorari
. We thus take this 
opportunity to remind counsel that in seeking a review or reversal of a 
judgment or order, the handling lawyer must fully and scrupulously 
comply with the requisites prescribed by law, with keen awareness that 
any error or imprecision in compliance therewith may well be fatal to 
his client's cause.
[61]
 


Ultimately, this Court finds it proper to decide the case based on 
the merits and brush aside the technicalities considering the 
substantial compliance of the petitioner with the formal requirements 
set out by the rules. 


Compensability of disability:
 


The employment of seafarers is governed by the terms and conditions 
of their employment contract, the law and the relevant regulations of 
the POEA SEC, which are deemed integrated into every employment 
contract, which employers are bound to observe as the minimum 
requirements for the employment of Filipino seafarers.
[62]
 


In this particular case, the 2000 POEA SEC
[63]
 issued pursuant to DOLE Department Order No. 4, and POEA Memorandum Circular No. 9, both series of 2000, apply, 
viz
.: 




Sec. 20 B. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS


 The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers 
work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as 
follows:


 x x x x


 2. If the injury or illness requires medical and/or dental treatment
 in a foreign port, the employer shall be liable for the full cost of 
such medical, serious dental, surgical and hospital treatment as well as
 board and lodging until the seafarer is declared fit to work or to be 
repatriated.


However, if after repatriation; the seafarer still requires medical 
attention arising from said injury or illness, he shall be so provided 
at cost to the employer until such time he is declared fit or the degree
 of his disability has been established by the company-designated 
physician.


x x x x


3. 
Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the 
seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage 
until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability 
has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case 
shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.


For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a 
postÂ­employment medical examination by a company-designated physician 
within three working days upon his return, except when he is physically 
incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency 
within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer 
to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his 
forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.


 If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the 
assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer 
and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be fmal and binding 
on both parties.


 6. In case of permanent total or partial disability of the seafarer 
caused by either injury or illness, the seafarer shall be compensated in
 accordance with the schedule of benefits enumerated in Section 32 of 
this Contract. Computation of his benefits arising from an illness or 
disease shall be governed by the rates and rules of compensation 
applicable at the time the illness or disease was contracted.


For a disability to be compensable under Section 20 (B) of the 2000 
POEA SEC, it must be the result of a work-related injury or a 
work-related or work-aggravated illness. The POEA SEC defines a 
work-related injury as "injuries resulting in disability or death 
arising out of and in the course of employment.'
[64]

 On the other hand, a work-related illness has been defined as "any 
sickness resulting in disability or death as a result of an occupational
 disease listed under Section 32-A of this contract with the conditions 
set therein satisfied."
[65]


Under the same rule, petitioner is obliged to submit himself to a 
postÂ­ employment medical examination by a company-designated physician 
within three working days upon his return, except when he is physically 
incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency 
within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure to comply with 
this mandatory reporting requirement shall result in forfeiture of the 
right to claim disability benefits. It is likewise provided that if a 
doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third 
doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer whose
 decision shall be fmal and binding on both parties.
[66]


In this case, petitioner submitted himselfto a medical examination by
 the company-designated doctor a day after his arrival in Manila. In 
that examination, it was confirmed that he had Myocardial Infarction and
 must undergo rehabilitation and continuous medication. Petitioner then 
requested for his treatment to be continued in Cebu, his hometown under 
the supervision of Inter-Orient's accredited doctors.
[67]
 Evidently, the Medical Report
[68]

 issued by Dr. Donna Delia S. Urlanda (Dr. Urlanda) of YGEIA Medical 
Clinic declared petitioner's illness as not work-related. Although 
petitioner alleged that he did not receive a copy of the said report, 
the same was unsubstantiated by evidence. Indeed, he never questioned 
the findings of Dr. Urlanda and her recommendation. Thus, at that point,
 petitioner clearly forfeited his right to claim any disability benefit.


De Jesus only questioned the company doctor's integrity and the 
correctness of her findings when he filed the complaint against 
respondents before the Arbiter on February 12, 2007, or roughly 10 
months after he was examined by the company-designated doctor. While 
petitioner allegedly consulted his personal doctors since April 26 2006,
 the Medical Certificate issued by Dr. Lim, his own doctor, stating that
 his illness was work-related, was only issued on December 5, 2008, or 
about 30 months after his examination by the company-designated 
physician.


This Court's ruling in 
German Marine Agencies v. National Labor Relations Commission
[69]

 weighs heavily against petitioner's claim for disability benefits. We 
have consistently held that it is the companyÂ­ designated physician who 
should determine the degree of disability of the seafarer or his fitness
 to work, thus: 


... In order to claim disability benefits under the Standard
 Employment Contract, it is the "company-designated" physician who must 
proclaim that the seaman suffered a permanent disability, whether total 
or partial, due to either injury or illness, during the term of the 
latter's employment.... It is a cardinal rule in the interpretation of 
contracts that if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt 
upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of 
its stipulation shall control. There is no ambiguity in the wording of 
the Standard Employment Contract â the only qualification prescribed for
 the physician entrusted with the task of assessing the seaman's 
disability is that he be "company-designated."
[70]


The 2000 POEA SEC provides for the company-designated doctor to 
assess the illness of the seafarer or his fitness to return to sea 
duties. In the event the seafarer disagrees with the assessment of the 
company-designated physician, he ought to consult his doctor of choice. 
Here, instead of consulting his own physician, De Jesus executed a 
release and quitclaim in favor of respondents. In executing this 
document, petitioner thus impliedly admitted the correctness of the 
assessment of the company-designated physician, and acknowledged that he
 could no longer claim for disability benefits.


Requisites for validity and


consequence of Quitclaims.


 While quitclaims are frowned upon for being contrary to public 
policy, this Court has nevertheless recognized legitimate waivers that 
represent a voluntary and reasonable settlement of a worker's claim 
Where the waiver was voluntarily executed with a full understanding 
thereof, and the consideration for the quitclaim is credible and 
reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and binding 
undertaking.
[71]
 


In the instant case, petitioner did not deny signing the documents 
relinquishing all his claims against the respondents. It is not disputed
 that he signed the "Quitclaim and Release"72 submitted before the labor
 tribunal and was subscribed and sworn to before the Labor Arbiter. 
Tellingly, the relevant portion of which states: 


xxx

***kung meron abogado ang naghahabol
[76]


Likewise, the amount of US$5,749.00 which he received in 
consideration of the quitclaim is credible and reasonable. As we held in
 
Periquet v. National Labor Relations Commission
:
[77]


Not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against 
public policy. If the agreement was voluntarily entered into and 
represents a reasonable settlement, it is binding on the parties and 
may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind. 
It is 
only where there is clear proof that the waiver was wangled from an 
unsuspecting or gullible person, or the terms of settlement are 
unconscionable on its face, that the law will step in to annul the 
questionable transaction. 
But where it is shown that the person 
making the waiver did so voluntarily. with full understanding of what he
 was doing, and the consideration for the quitclaim is credible and 
reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and binding 
undertaking. x x x 
[78]
 [Emphasis Ours]


In sum, in order for a deed of release, waiver or quitclaim 
pertaining to an existing right to be valid, it must meet the following 
requirements: (1) that there was no fraud or deceit or coercion on the 
part of any of the parties; (2) that the consideration for the quitclaim
 is sufficient and reasonable; and (3) that the contract is not contrary
 to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or 
prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.
[79]


At this point, petitioner was already aware of his medical condition 
when he signed the waiver as he was examined by the company-designated 
doctor. Moreover, there was no proof that respondents employed fraud, 
malice, force or duress to compel him to sign the quitclaim. "Lack of 
sleep and exhaustion", can hardly be accepted as grounds to invalidate 
the waiver considering that it was signed six days after his arrival. 
For sure, as a seasoned seafarer, petitioner properly considered his 
decision of giving up his rights before signing the quitclaim.


Furthermore, this Court is inclined to sustain the validity of the 
quitclaim considering that it was signed before the Labor Arbiter. 
Article 227 [233]
[80]
 of the Labor Code provides:


Art. 227. Compromise agreements
. Any compromise settlement, including those involving labor standard laws, voluntarily agreed upon by the parties 
with the assistance of the Bureau or the regional office of the Department of Labor, shall be final and binding upon the parties
.
 The National Labor Relations Commission or any court, shall not assume 
jurisdiction over issues involved therein except in case of 
non-compliance thereof or if there is prima facie evidence that the 
settlement was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion.


Hence, the Quitclaim being valid, it legally serves as a bar to the present claim of petitioner for disability benefits.


All told, this Court finds no merit in the supplication of the 
petitioner. He is not entitled to disability benefits for his failure to
 validly and timely question the findings of the company-designated 
physician declaring his disability not work-related or aggravated, and 
in view of the valid quitclaim which he himself executed relinquishing 
all his rights against the respondents.
