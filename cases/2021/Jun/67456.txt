 Resolution

Antecedents



In his Notice to Arbitrate
[3]
 
dated July 24, 2017, petitioner submitted to the Regional Conciliation 
and Mediation Board (RCMB) - National Capital Region his claim for total
 and permanent disability benefits and damages for the lower back injury
 he sustained at Cartagena, Colombia. He essentially alleged:
[4]



Respondent Hoegh Fleet Services Philippines, Inc. initially hired him as ordinary seaman
[5]

 in 2014. In September 2016, respondent directed him anew to undergo 
Pre-Employment Medical Examination at SuperCare Medical Services, Inc. 
for his upcoming December 2016 deployment. By Medical Certificate for 
Service at Sea
[6]
 dated November 3, 2016, he was declared fit for sea duties.



On November 14, 2016, respondent officially engaged him as ordinary 
seaman on behalf of its foreign principal, Hoegh LNG Colombia SAS. His 
employment was covered by a Philippine Overseas Employment 
Administration (POEA) approved contract and PHIL Model LNG 2016 
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).



On December 5, 2016, he left the country for Cartagena, Colombia where he would board 
Hoegh Grace
. Upon his arrival, respondent billeted him at the Holiday Inn Hotel while awaiting embarkation on December 7, 2016.



Unfortunately, on the day of his embarkation, he slipped while taking a 
shower at Holiday Inn and fell on his buttocks. He felt excruciating 
pain and recurring numbness in his lower back and extremity. The 
incident, however, did not hinder him from boarding the vessel. Upon 
embarkation, he reported the accident to the Bosun (ship's officer) and 
requested for pain reliever. The latter relayed the incident to the 
chief mate. Instead of compassionately acting on his request, he was 
ordered to immediately go to work. He was made to carry heavy baggage 
and cans of grease the whole day.



Due to the strenuous work on the first day and lack of medical 
attention, his back pain worsened and he had difficulty getting out of 
bed the next day. Thus, he was sent to a hospital in Cartagena, Colombia
 where he was diagnosed with 
mechanical lumbago
 by the 
company-designated physician Dr. Marlon de Avila (Dr. Avila). He was 
given medication and ordered to rest for five (5) days.





Because of his persistent back pain, he returned for a follow up 
check-up on December 13, 2016 where he was diagnosed, this time, with 
perianal
 abscess. He was also advised to continue his medication for his 
mechanical lumbago
.



In his Medical Report dated December 20, 2016,
[7]
 Dr. Avila prescribed antibiotic and advised him to take a rest for another seven (7) days, 
viz
.:


Patient who consults because two weeks ago[,] he suffered a 
fall from his own weight while bathing, later[,] he [h]as generated 
lumbar pain and today[,] refers appearance of anal lesion and fever for 
24 hours.


During the medical examination, the doctor observes perianal abscess without signs of a systemic inflammatory response.




It was applied [sic] intravenous medication to relieve the pain and recommendations and warning signs are indicated.


It is important to take Antibiotic treatment, anti-inflammatory analgesics, baths with warm water and rest for 7 days.


Best regards,


Dr. Marlon de Avila

Medicos y Auditores




But his condition did not improve. Consequently, he was medically 
repatriated on January 2, 2017 and arrived in the Philippines on January
4, 2017. He immediately reported to respondent's office the following 
day and was referred to Shiphealth, Inc. (Shiphealth) for evaluation. 
Shiphealth advised him to undergo medication and physical therapy which 
commenced on January 17, 2017. On April 15, 2017, respondent 
discontinued petitioner's physical therapy despite lack of any 
improvement on his condition.



Later, he was 
verbally
 assessed to be fit for work. Respondent 
tried to force him to sign a certificate of fitness to work but he 
refused. He patiently waited for a copy of the medical assessment 
instead, but to no avail. Thereafter, he repeatedly demanded for 
respondent to issue any medical assessment but the latter did not.



As he could no longer tolerate his back pain, he consulted orthopedic 
specialist Dr. Renato P. Runas (Dr. Runas) on June 6, 2017. He was 
advised to undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the result of which
 showed 
disk desiccation and mild posterior disk bulge L4-L5
[8]
 so he underwent further monitoring under Dr. Runas' care. In his Medical Evaluation Report
[9]

 dated June 21, 2017, Dr. Runas assessed him to be suffering from total 
and permanent disability and declared him unfit for sea duty in whatever
 capacity, thus:


MEDICAL EVALUATION REPORT


June 21, 2017


This is the case of 
Seaman Christopher C. Calera
, 32 years old, 
male, single, Filipino, and presently residing at 2509 Magsaysay, Tubao,
 La Union with a chief complaint of low back pain.


Present condition apparently started on December 7, 2016 after he 
accidentally slipped in the shower room and landed on his buttocks. He 
experienced lower back pain with numbness. He was able to stand after 
more than a minute. While walking, he felt pain associated with numbness
 at the right lower back and lower extremity. He reported the incident 
to the Bosun who relayed it to the Chief Mate but no immediate response 
was given. He later joined fellow seafarers in loading baggage and heavy
 cans of grease. The pain intensity increased while carrying heavy 
object. On the next day, (December 8, 2016) he was unable to get up 
because of severe low back pain. He was advised to rest by the CM and 
given medications. He was brought to a hospital in Cartagena, Colombia 
for evaluation. He was diagnosed [with] 
mechanical lumbago
 and 
given pain reliever which afforded mil[d] relief. He was also declared 
unfit to work for 5 days and given pain medications. He went back for 
follow-up on December 13, 2016 since no improvement was noted. X-ray of 
the lumbosacral spine was done. Result showed muscle spasm. He was given
 steroid injection, oral pain medications and topical analgesic. He 
consulted again on December 20, 2016 still complaining of low back pain.
 On examination, he was noted to be febrile. Perianal abscess was noted.
 He was given antibiotics and oral medications for pain. He was advised 
to rest for 7 days. After 1 week, he returned to work and given light 
duties. He was eventually repatriated for further evaluation and 
management on January 2, 2017.




Upon arrival, he was referred at Shiphealth Clinic for evaluation, 
XÂ­ray, MRI of the lumbosacral spine, EMG-NCV[,] was done but results 
were unknown to patient. He was given oral medications and referred to 
rehabilitation department. He underwent physical therapy for 4 sessions.
 The treatment was later terminated by the company.


At present, Seaman Calera is still complaining of nagging pain on the 
lower back. Pain is very intense in the morning and with varying degrees
 of intensity during the whole day. Lower extremity numbness is 
experienced during prolonged standing and walking and relieved by rest.


On physical examination, no gross abnormality was noted. He was 
ambulatory with no limp. Tenderness was elicited at the lumbar area. 
Muscle spasm was noted at the lower paraspinal muscles. Trunk flexion 
was limited due to pain from the mid to lower back. SLR is equivocal due
 to hamstring muscles and Achilles tendon tightness. Low back pain is 
aggravated by Valsalva's maneuver (coughing and straining).


Seaman Calera is incapacitated due to persistent moderate lower back 
pain. The clinical manifestation is suggestive of a lumbar disc disease 
and confirmed by MRT by the presence of a posterior disc bulge. It is 
worthy to mention that Seaman Calera is asymptomatic and very active 
prior to the accident. The fall resulted in the development of a disc 
bulge which is causing the chronic low back pain. Due to this 
impediment, he is no longer capable of performing the tasks of an 
Ordinary Seaman. He cannot carry and lift heavy objects because of the 
high probability of progression of the condition. His capacity to work 
is greatly affected and reduced and is not physically fit to return to 
his previous job. He is unfit for sea duty in whatever capacity with a 
permanent disability since he can no longer perform his work which he is
 previously engaged in.

By letter
[11]
 dated July 5, 
2017, he requested a conference with respondent to discuss his 
entitlement to disability benefits under the CBA in view of his 
untreated medical condition and failure to land gainful employment in an
 ocean-going vessel for more than 120 days from repatriation.



Respondent, however, did not bother taking action, prompting him to file
 the Notice to Arbitrate before the RCMB. The parties initially agreed 
to conduct grievance proceedings pursuant to the CBA with Associated 
Marine Officers' and Seamen's Union of the Philippines (AMOSUP) and 
Hoegh LNG Maritime. Consequently, the RCMB held in abeyance the 
selection of voluntary arbitrators.



During the grievance proceedings, he willingly agreed to submit his case
 for disability assessment to a third doctor. He even provided 
respondent with a set of parameters acceptable to him, 
viz

Arellano Ave, Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines


Dear Atty. Cengca,


x x x for the purpose of referring the assessment to a third doctor, the
 following parameters are submitted in view of the conduct of the third 
doctor assessment, to wit:


That the referral shall not be construed as a waiver of any right or
 presumption of law already acquired by the complainant under 
established principles of law and labor code concept of disability;


That the conduct of assessment of fitness or unfitness must be 
done in accordance with the DOH Revised Guidelines for Conducting 
Medical Fitness Examination for Seafarers;


That the failure by the third doctor to strictly comply with 
the DOH Revised Guidelines shall render the third doctor assessment NULL
 and VOID;


That the referral to a third doctor must be made within 15 days from the time of agreement to submit to a third doctor; and


The seafarer suggests Dr. Jason Paul Santiago of the Philippine
 Orthopedic Center to be the one to conduct the assessment and that the 
expenses shall be solely borne by the Company.



We would highly appreciate your response to this letter within five (5) 
days from receipt thereof so that we could proceed with the third doctor
 assessment under the above-mentioned parameters. Otherwise, the 
undersigned will regard the same as failure of the parties to agree on 
the third doctor assessment.


Very truly yours,

Respondent disagreed to the above proposal and the referral to third 
doctor did not proceed. The grievance proceedings were terminated for 
the parties' failure to amicably settle. Meanwhile, the proceedings 
before the RCMB resumed.



During the RCMB proceedings, he demonstrated before the Panel of 
Arbitrators the difficulty of moving his body due to lower back pain 
which required him to use back brace support. He, too, manifested that 
he had been undergoing physical therapy since June 30, 2017. In her 
Medical Report dated April 2, 2018, Physical Therapist Maricar E. 
Basario (PT Basario) noted petitioner's limited trunk movement and lower
 back pain:

 on the other hand, countered that petitioner was engaged as an ordinary seaman for five (5) months on board 
Hoegh Grace

 He boarded the vessel on December 12, 2016. He was referred to a 
medical doctor in Cartagena, Colombia where he was diagnosed with

FINAL MEDICAL REPORT


Mr. Calera is a 33-year-old male from La Union who was referred for the management of perianal abscess and low back pain.


Present illness started on December 6, 2016 when the patient presented 
to the vessel's medical officer with complaints of right-sided low back 
pain of VAS 6-7/10 accompanied by paresthesia on the right lower 
extremity after prolonged sitting. Pain medication was given. On 
December 8, 13 and 19, 2016, patient was referred to a shore side 
facility in [Colombia]. Assessment was 
Mechanical Lumbago
. 
Intravenous medications were given, with temporary relief of symptoms. 
During the course of treatment, patient complained of minimal perianal 
pain after defecation. Possible perianal abscess was considered. Home 
country referral was recommended for further evaluation and management. 
Patient was repatriated on January 4, 2017 and was then referred to our 
facility.


Past Medical History:
 s/p Proctosigmoidoscopy with 
Hemorrhoidectomy for Mixed Hemorrhoids (September 30, 2015); s/p repeat 
proctosigmoidoscopy with Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy for Anal 
Fissure (January 27, 2016); s/p Proctosigmoidoscopy with Lateral 
Internal Sphincterotomy for Anal Fissure (June 22, 2016)


Pertinent Findings on Initial Physical Examination






General 


conscious, coherent, ambulatory, not in cardiorespiratory distress






Back and Spine


No gross bone deformity and intact spine 
curvature; (+) tenderness on paralumbar areas; No pain on trunk flexion;
 (-) straight leg raising and FABERE tests;






Extremities


(+) minimal tenderness on end-range of extension of right shoulder;








Pulses full and equal, no cyanosis, no masses or lesions, MMT 5/5 on all extremities






Rectal 


No perianal abscess, hemorrhoids or anal fissures;








No blood on examining finger






Clinical Course


For perianal abscess:


Patient was examined by General Surgery service on January 5, 2017. At 
that time, patient denied having perianal pain, bloody or purulent 
discharge and irregularities in bowel movement. On examination, no 
perianal abscess, hemorrhoids or anal fissures were identified. No 
treatment intervention was indicated for the referred condition at that 
time. Patient was then discharged by General Surgery service for the 
condition referred.


For low back pain:


On January 6 and 30, 2017, patient was evaluated by Orthopedic Spine 
Surgery service. At that time, he reported intermittent low back pain of
 VAS 3/10 with paresthesia on the right lower extremity. Initial 
consideration was Lumbar Muscle Strain and rule-out Spine Fracture. 
Commencement of rehabilitation therapy was recommended.


X-ray of the cervical spine showed the cervical bodies, pedicles, 
posterior elements and intervertebral disc spaces are intact. X-ray of 
the thoracolumbar spine showed normal findings. Assessment was possible 
Radiculopathy, right probably secondary to Herniated Nucleus Pulposus. 
To facilitate return of full function, continued physical therapy was 
recommended.


 
After completion of 6 sessions of physical therapy (2
nd
 set),
 Mr. Calera was then re-evaluated by Orthopedic Spine Surgery. He 
claimed occasional low back pain of VAS 2110 accompanied by less 
paresthesia on the right lower extremity. EMG-NCV findings were within 
normal limits. Re-assessment was Piriformis Syndrome, right with 
Sciatica. Continuation of physical therapy was advised to alleviate pain
 and to improve range of motion. As needed pain medications were 
continued.


On re-evaluation by Orthopedic Spine Surgery service on March 24, 2017 after completion of 3
rd

 set of physical therapy, patient claimed occasional low back pain and 
paresthesia on the right lower extremity. Medications were revised. 
Another 6 sessions of physical therapy [were] recommended.


Mr. Calera returned for follow up on April 17, 2017 after completion of 4
th

 physiotherapy set. Post rehabilitation, patient claimed of intermittent
 numbness or paresthesia on the right lower leg. He claimed resolution 
of low back pain. He had no other subjective complaints. Objectively, 
physical exam showed no swelling and no tenderness with improved lumbar 
range of motion. There was noted MMT 5/5 on all extremities. Final 
diagnosis was Piriformis Syndrome, right with Sciatica, improving. 
Orthopedic Spine service opined that no further active intervention was 
indicated for the patient at that time except for continued 
self-directed home exercises.


After discussion of case with concerned parties, transfer of care patient's physician of choice was requested on June 13, 2017.


Final Diagnosis:


Piriformis Syndrome, right with Sciatica, improving


s/p 4 sets of physical therapy (6 sessions each)

Petitioner was declared fit to return to work but refused to sign his 
certificate of fitness to work. On July 24, 2018, he filed a Notice to 
Arbitrate before the RCMB. It countered with a Motion to Dismiss
[30]
 to give way to the grievance proceedings before the AMOSUP as provided in the CBA.



During the grievance proceedings, the parties explored the possibility 
of referring petitioner's medical condition to a third doctor. They did 
not, however, arrive at mutually acceptable parameters in the selection 
of the third doctor. Thus, the proceedings before the RCMB resumed. 
Respondents prayed for the denial of petitioner's claim as he was 
claiming compensation for an illness - lumbar disc disease, different 
from that for which he was repatriated - 
perianal abscess
.


The Ruling of the Panel of Arbitrators



By Decision
[31]
 dated November 19, 2018, the Panel of Arbitrators
[32]
 ruled in petitioner's favor, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the 
respondent to pay the complainant the amount of US$60,000.00 as total 
and permanent disability compensation, plus ten percent (10%) thereof as
 attorney's (sic) fees, or in Philippine currency at the rate of 
exchange prevailing on the date of payment.


SO ORDERED.








 


The Panel of Arbitrators held that the POEA approved contract between 
petitioner and respondent was already effective when the former slipped 
in the bathroom of the Holiday Inn. They noted that petitioner had 
principally complained of back pain from the very beginning. It was only
 the cause of such pain that the doctors differed. It was, therefore, 
error for respondent to conclude that petitioner was claiming payment 
for an illness distinct from that for which he was repatriated. Against 
the company-designated physicians' findings, they gave greater weight to
 petitioner's physician of choice who noted that petitioner was 
incapacitated due to persistent lower back pain suggestive of a lumbar 
disc disease.





The Panel of Arbitrators, however, denied petitioner's claim for disability benefits under the CBA on the following grounds; 
first
, slipping on a wet bathroom floor could not be said to have been caused by accident as it cannot be totally unexpected; 
second
, petitioner was neither an officer to be entitled to the US$110,000.00 nor a cadet to be entitled to US$90,000.00; and 
third
,
 petitioner did not even attach a copy of the alleged Model Agreement 
for Non-Norwegian Vessels for Filipino Officers and Ratings to prove his
 entitlement thereto.
[33]



Petitioner's claim for sickness allowance, too, was denied for lack of 
basis. The Panel of Arbitrators, nonetheless, deemed sufficient 
respondent's payment of P80,148.75 to petitioner as sickness allowance.



Lastly, the Panel of Arbitrators denied petitioner's prayer for moral 
and exemplary damages as respondent did not act in a wanton or 
fraudulent manner in refusing petitioner's claims.



Respondent's motion for reconsideration got denied by Resolution
[34]
 dated February 6, 2019.


Proceedings before the Court of Appeals



Respondent elevated the case to the Court of Appeals 
via
 a petition for review
[35]

 under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. It argued that there was 
absolutely no basis for the panel of arbitrator's award of disability 
compensation benefits to petitioner.


For one
, petitioner was claiming payment for an illness different from that for which he was repatriated - 
perianal abscess
 and not lumbar disc disease. More, the illness was not work-related and pre-existing.


For another
, spinal problems do not automatically entitle a 
seafarer to disability benefits. More so in this case where petitioner's
 condition was ageÂ­related.




 


It prayed for the deletion of the award of attorney's fees for want of 
basis. It adopted and reproduced the above allegations in support of its
 prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order and or preliminary
 injunction order.



In his Comment,
[36]
 petitioner
 countered that his entitlement to total and permanent disability 
benefits was by operation of law since there was no final and definitive
 assessment of fitness to work. Petitioner was repatriated on January 2,
 2017, and more than 240 days had passed since then but no medical 
assessment with disability grading was ever issued. More, the lack of 
redeployment proved his unfitness to work and his total and permanent 
disability.





Contrary to respondent's claim, he was repatriated due to 
perianal abscess
 and 
mechanical lumbago
.
 At any rate, he pointed out that he was not suffering from any illness 
or injury prior to embarkation, which proved that his back pain was 
accident and work-related. It was clear from the alleged final medical 
report that he was far from recovery. He insisted on his entitlement to 
attorney's fees.


The Ruling of the Court of Appeals



Through its assailed Decision
[37]
 dated July 12, 2019, the Court of Appeals reversed, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Petition for Review is 
GRANTED
.
 The Decision dated November 19,2018 and Resolution dated February 6, 
2019 of the Philippine Association of Voluntary Arbitrators (PAVA), 
Regional Conciliation and Mediation Board, National Capital Region in 
MVA-034-NCR-044-02-02-2018 are hereby 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.




It held that petitioner's condition was neither accidental nor workÂ­related. 
First
,
 to espouse that the accident was the direct and proximate cause of 
petitioner's disability effectively ruled out the body's wear and tear 
due to prolonged strenuous work. 
Second
, petitioner failed to 
establish his condition's work-relatedness. At the time of the accident,
 he was inside his hotel room and was neither exposed to the perils of 
the sea nor on board 
Hoegh Grace
. His injury, therefore, had nothing to do with his seafarer duties. 
Lastly
,
 the CBA only contemplated the seafarer going to or from his or her 
vessel to be entitled to the benefits thereto. The failure of the 
companyÂ­designated physicians to clear petitioner for sea duty was 
immaterial since the direct and proximate cause of the injury was not 
work-related.



Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the same was denied per Resolution
[38]
 dated November 22, 2019.


The Present Petition



Petitioner now seeks affirmative relief and prays that the assailed 
dispositions of the Court of Appeals be reversed, and the Panel of 
Arbitrators' decision, reinstated.





He asserts that his illness is work-related and, thus, faults the Court 
of Appeals for holding that there were no risk factors associated with 
traveling when the incident happened while he was taking a bath; and 
that the incident had nothing to do with both the nature of his 
employment and the possible risk factor of being in transit.



Meanwhile, the seafarer's contract commenced from actual departure from 
the Philippine ai1 ort, the point of hire. Thus, the injury happened 
during the commencement of the employment contract, in a place where he 
should reasonably be, and engaged in something incidental thereto - 
preparing for embarkation.



In its Comment,
[39]
 respondent
 supports the dispositions of the Court of Appeals. It counters that 
petitioner's illness is not work-related and the accident occurred even 
before he could embark on the vessel. Thus, he was never exposed to the 
perils of the sea and the injury had nothing to do with the nature of 
his seafarer duties. At any rate, the company-designated physicians 
declared him fit to work. Petitioner's basis for his claim for 
disability benefits, lumbar disc disease, is completely different from 
that for which he was repatriated - 
perianal abscess
.


Threshold Issue



Is petitioner entitled to total and permanent disability benefits?


The Court's Ruling



The petition is meritorious.



Preliminarily, the Court notes that the issues presented in this case 
are factual in nature. Ordinarily, this Court is not a trier of facts 
and does not embark in the evaluation of evidence adduced during trial. 
This rule, however, allows for exceptions as when the findings of fact 
of the quasiÂ­judicial agencies concerned are conflicting or 
contradictory with those of the Court of Appeals, as here. When there is
 a variance in the factual findings, it is incumbent upon the Court to 
re-examine the facts once again.
[40]





We proceed to the merits.






Petitioner is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.


 







The seafarers' employment is governed by the contracts they signed at 
the time of engagement. As long as the stipulations therein are not 
contrary to law, morals, public order, or public policy, they have the 
force of law between the parties. Nonetheless, while the seafarer and 
his employer are governed by their mutual agreement, the POEA Rules and 
Regulations require that the POEA-Standard Employment Contract 
(POEA-SEC) be integrated in every seafarer's contract.
[41]





Here, petitioner's employment is governed by the POEA-SEC executed on 
November 14, 2016, the CBA between the AMOSUP and Hoegh LNG Maritime 
Management PTE LTD., and the CBA for Filipino Officers between the 
Norwegian Shipowners' Association and the AMOSUP, the Norwegian Maritime
 Officers' Association, and the Norwegian Union of Marine Engineers.


a. The Holiday Inn incident was not a compensable accident.




Section 1 (4) of the 2010 POEA-SEC mandates the principal employer to 
take precautions to prevent accident and provide safe working 
environment for the seafarer, 
viz
.:


4. To provide a seaworthy ship for the seafarer and take all
 reasonable precautions to prevent accident and injury to the crew 
including provision of safety equipment, fire prevention, safe and 
proper navigation of the ship and such other precautions necessary to 
avoid accident, injury or sickness to the seafarer.
[42]




Black's Law Dictionary defines "accident" as an unintended and 
unforeseen injurious occurrence; something that does not occur in the 
usual course of events or that could not be reasonably anticipated; an 
unforeseen and injurious occurrence not attributable to mistake, 
negligence, neglect, or misconduct. The Philippine Law Dictionary, on 
the other, defines "accident" as that which happens by chance or 
fortuitously, without intention and design, and which is unexpected, 
unusual, and unforeseen. In its commonly accepted meaning, accident has 
been defined as a fortuitous circumstance, event, or happening, an event
 happeni.ng without any human agency, or if happening wholly or partly 
through human agency, an event which under the circumstances, is unusual
 and unexpected by the person to whom it happens. It may denote a 
calamity, casualty, catastrophe, disaster, an undesirable or unfortunate
 happening; any unexpected personal injury resulting from any unlooked 
for mishap or occurrence; any unpleasant or unfortunate occurrence, that
 causes injury, loss, suffering, or death; some untoward occurrence 
aside from the usual course of events.
[43]





On December 5, 2016, petitioner left for Cartagena, Colombia where he would board 
Hoegh Grace
.
 Since he arrived earlier than his embarkation, respondent checked him 
in at the Holiday Inn. On December 7, 2016, the day of his embarkation, 
he slipped and fell on his buttocks while taking a shower, causing him 
excruciating lower back pain.



To our mind, slipping in the bathroom floor is not an unforeseen 
injurious occurrence that could not be reasonably anticipated. For once a
 person enters the bathroom, he knows for a fact that the floor could 
get slippery and cause him bodily injuries. Too, there is no showing of 
any measures petitioner adopted to at least lessen or avoid the injury 
caused by a slippery floor. We cannot therefore consider the incident as
 an "accident" within the contemplation of the POEA-SEC contract.




b. Petitioner's injury was work-aggravated



The Court nevertheless finds that petitioner suffered compensable injury
 under Section 20(A) of the POEA-SEC. For an injury or disability to be 
compensable under this provision, two (2) elements must concur: (1) the 
injury or illness must be work-related; and (2) the work-related injury 
or illness must have existed during the term of the seafarer's 
employment contract.
[44]
 For a
 disability claim to prosper, a seafarer only needs to show that his 
work and contracted illness have a reasonable linkage that must lead a 
rational mind to conclude that his occupation may have contributed or 
aggravated the disease.
[45]





For the first element, the POEA-SEC defines work-related injury as one 
"arising out of and in the course of employment." Jurisprudence further 
teaches that compensable illness or injury cannot be confined to the 
strict interpretation. of the POEA-SEC as pre-existing conditions may be
 compensable if 
aggravated
 by the seafarer's work.
[46]



Here, it is undisputed that before actual boarding of the vessel on 
December 7, 2016, petitioner slipped in the bathroom of Holiday Inn and 
suffered injury. To reiterate, this, by itself, is not compensable. But 
when petitioner boarded his assigned vessel, he immediately reported the
 incident to the Bosun, as well as the excruciating pain and recurring 
numbness he had been experiencing on his lower back and extremity after 
said incident. Apparently, he was already suffering from 
mechanical lumbago
 and 
perianal abscess

 at this point. He requested for pain reliever but was not given any. 
And instead of showing compassion, his superiors ordered him to 
immediately get to work, making him carry heavy baggage and cans of 
grease.



These circumstances show that the injury petitioner suffered at Holiday Inn which would have otherwise been not compensable was 
aggravated

 by his work on board the vessel. Indeed, due to the strenuous work on 
the first day and lack of medical attention, petitioner's condition 
worsened, and he even had difficulty getting out of bed the next day. In
 view of the factual backdrop, we rule that petitioner's injury was 
work-related or more specifically, 
work-aggravated
.



In 
Centennial Transmarine, Inc. v. Quiambao
,
[47]

 therein respondent Â­ seafarer Quiambao figured in an accident while 
carrying heavy food provisions which caused him excruciating pain in his
 upper back. The labor arbiter, NLRC, and the Court of Appeals uniformly
 found petitioner to be suffering from osteoarthritis. Quiambao was able
 to prove the conditions necessary for osteoarthritis to be considered 
as having arisen in the course of his employment either by direct 
causation or aggravation due to the nature of his work. According to the
 Court, it was also plain from his duties and responsibilities that his 
work involved carrying heavy loads and the performance of other 
strenuous activities such that it can reasonably be concluded that his 
work caused or at least aggravated his illness.



It is of no moment that petitioner suffered the injury at Holiday Inn. 
For it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole 
and only reason for the illness or injury suffered by the seafarer.
[48]
 In 
Heirs of Licuanan v. Singa Ship Management, Inc.
,
 the Court categorically held that it is not required that the 
employment be the sole factor in the growth, development, or 
acceleration of the illness to entitle the claimant to the benefits 
incident thereto. It is enough that the employment had contributed, even
 in a small measure, to the development of the disease.
[49]



As for the second requisite of a compensable injury, suffice it to state
 that petitioner's condition was aggravated by his work during the term 
of his employment contract.



So must it be.


Petitioner's disability is total and permanent



Having established the compensability of petitioner's injury, we proceed
 to determine his disability rating and respondent's corresponding 
liability.








 


Under the 2010 POEA-SEC, the company-designated physician is primarily 
vested with responsibility to determine the seafarer's disability 
grading or fitness to work.
[50]
 In 
Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr.
,
[51]
 the Court set forth the following guidelines in determining whether a medical report was timely issued, 
viz
.:


1. The company-designated physician must issue a final 
medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period 
of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him;


2. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment 
within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the 
seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total;


3. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment 
within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (
e.g.

 seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was 
uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be 
extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the 
company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the 
period; and




4. If the company-designated physician still fails to give his 
assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's 
disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.




Verily, two (2) requisites must concur: 1) an assessment must be issued 
within the 120/240-day window, and 2) the assessment must be final and 
definitive.
[52]


a. The assessment was timely issued.



Here, petitioner was medically repatriated on January 2, 2017 and 
arrived in the Philippines on January 4, 2017. After series of medical 
procedure, the company-designated physicians issued an interim medical 
report which assessed petitioner's condition as a grade 8 disability. 
This interim report was issued on April 10, 2017, or 96 days from 
repatriation and within the 120-day window prescribed by law. Since 
petitioner still required further medical treatment as evidenced by the 
several medical reports that followed, the period of diagnosis and 
treatment was extended to 240 days. The company-designated physicians 
issued the alleged final medical assessment on June 13, 2017, or 160 
days from repatriation, and within the 240-day period.



Verily, the medical reports were timely issued by the companyÂ­designated
 physicians. As will be discussed, the timeliness of the issuance of the
 medical reports is of no moment since the alleged final medical report 
was not at all final.






b.


 
The company-designated physicians failed to issue a final and definitive assessment of petitioner's condition


 









A 
final and definite disability assessment
 is necessary in order 
to reflect the true extent of the seafarer's sickness or injuries and 
his or her capacity to resume work as such. Otherwise, the corresponding
 disability benefits awarded might not be commensurate with the 
prolonged effects of the injuries suffered.
[53]
 Before the disability ratings from the companyÂ­designated physician may be considered, 
they should first be properly established and contained in a valid and timely medical report
.
 Thus, the foremost consideration of the courts should be to determine 
whether the company-designated physician's medical assessment or report 
was 
complete and appropriately issued
; otherwise, the medical 
report shall be set aside, and the disability grading contained therein 
cannot be seriously appreciated.
[54]



To be conclusive, the company-designated physicians' medical assessments
 or reports must be complete and definite to give the proper disability 
benefits to seafarers.
[55]
 Guided by jurisprudence, the following are the characteristics of a final and complete medical report:


One.
 It must be 
complete
. In 
Hanseatic Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. Ballon
,
[56]

 the Court treated the undated medical report as incomplete because it 
only discussed the treatment of Ballon's myofascial pain dysfunction, 
but not his cervical myelopathy in his right C5-C6.




Two.
 It must be 
definite
. The definiteness of a medical 
report pertains to the company-designated physicians' assessment of the 
seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the period of 
120 or 240 days. The company doctor must declare the seaman fit to work 
or assess the degree of his permanent disability. Without which, the 
characterization of a seafarer's condition as permanent and total will 
ensue because the ability to return to one's accustomed work before the 
applicable periods elapse cannot be shown.
[57]



Here, the company-designated physicians, Shiphealth, issued the alleged final medical report dated June 13, 2017, 
viz
.:


FINAL MEDICAL REPORT


Mr. Calera is a 33-year-old male from La Union who was referred for the management of perianal abscess and low back pain.


Present illness started on December 6, 2016 when the patient presented 
to the vessel 's medical officer with complaints of right-sided low back
 pain of VAS 6-7/10 accompanied by paresthesia on the right lower 
extremity after prolonged sitting. Pain medication was given. On 
December 8, 13 and 19, 2016, patient was referred to a shore side 
facility in Columbia. Assessment was 
Mechanical Lumbago
. 
Intravenous medications were given, with temporary relief of symptoms. 
During the course of treatment, patient complained of minimal perianal 
pain after defecation. Possible perianal abscess was considered. Home 
country referral was recommended for further evaluation and management. 
Patient was repatriated on January 4, 2017 and was then referred to our 
facility.




x x x x


Final Diagnosis:


Piriformis Syndrome, right with Sciatica, improving s/p 4 sets of physical therapy (6 sessions each)


Prepared by:


Shiphealth Medical Team/JRA
[58]




As worded, the medical report was far from final. For one, the 
company-designated physicians made no mention of any disability rating 
nor any declaration as to petitioner's fitness or unfitness for further 
sea duty. For another, the alleged finality of the medical report was 
negated by the fact that petitioner needed further medical treatment, 
i.e.
,
 he was referred for four (4) sets of physical therapy with six (6) 
sessions each. That he was not reÂ­deployed after the incident at the 
Holiday Inn lends credence to the fact that he still needed further 
medical attention and far from healed.





The Court, therefore, finds the June 13, 2017 medical report to have 
fallen short of the parameters for a final and definite medical report. 
Even if the company-designated physicians were justified in extending 
petitioner's medical treatment to more than 120 days, yet, as earlier 
stated, the alleged final medical report is far from final.



Sans a valid final and definite assessment from the company-designated 
physicians within the 120/240-day period, the law already steps in to 
consider, petitioner's disability as total and permanent.
[59]
 By operation of law, therefore, petitioner is deemed totally and permanently disabled.





In 
Magsaysay Mol Marine, Inc. v. Atraje
,
[60]

 the Court held that respondent's inability to perform his customary sea
 duties, coupled with the company-designated physicians' abdication of 
their primary duty to declare his fitness or unfitness to work within 
the prescribed period, transformed his disability to permanent and total
 by operation of law. There, the companyÂ­ designated physicians, 
Shiphealth, clearly breached their duty to provide a definite assessment
 of respondent's condition. Despite medication and physical therapy, 
respondent was not restored to his pre-injury health status.



In the same vein, 
Carcedo v. Maine Marine Philippines
[61]

 teaches that the company-designated physician's failure to give a 
definitive impediment rating of Carcedo's disability beyond the extended
 temporary disability period, after the 120-day period but less than 240
 days transformed Carcedo's total and temporary disability into a total 
and permanent disability by operation of law.


Monetary Awards



Contrary to petitioner's claim, he is not entitled to USD90,000.00 
disability benefits under the CBA. Article 12 thereof provides:


If an 
officer
[,] due to no fault of his own, suffers 
an occupational injury as a result of an accident or an occupational 
disease, while serving on board or while travelling to or from the 
vessel on Company's business or due to marine peril, and as a result[,] 
his ability to work is permanently reduced, totally or partially, and 
never to be declared fit. The Company shall pay him a disability 
compensation which including the amounts stipulated by the POEA's rules 
and regulations shall be the maximum USD110.000 for officers and 
USD90.000 for 
cadets
.
[62]
 (Emphases added)





As the panel of voluntary arbitrators observed, petitioner is neither an
 officer nor cadet, but an ordinary seafarer. Thus, we apply the 
POEA-SEC under which petitioner is entitled to USD60,000.00.
[63]



Meanwhile, petitioner's prayer for moral and exemplary damages should be
 denied for failure to show that respondent acted in a wanton, 
fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner in dealing with 
him for medical treatment.
[64]

 On the contrary, respondent attended to petitioner's medical needs 
after he continued complaining of his injury as shown by the numerous 
medical reports.



An award of attorney's fees of 10% of the total monetary award is 
warranted, considering that petitioner was compelled to litigate to 
satisfy his claim for disability benefits.
[65]



Lastly, the monetary awards shall earn six percent (6%) legal interest 
per annum
 from finality of this decision until fully paid.
[66]


ACCORDINGLY
, the petition is 
GRANTED
 and the Decision dated July 12, 2019 and Resolution dated November 22, 2019, 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
. Petitioner Christopher C. Calera is declared
