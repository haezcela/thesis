PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 are the Decision
[2]
 dated September 27, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated March 1, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 134259, which affirmed the Decision
[4]
 dated October 30, 2013 and the Resolution
[5]

 dated December 26, 2013 of the National Labor Relations Commission 
(NLRC) in LAC No. 07- 000700-13, dismissing petitioner Antonio D. 
Orlanes' (Orlanes) money claims.


The Facts



On July 24, 2012, Orlanes filed a complaint
[6]
 (
second

 complaint) before the Labor Arbiter (LA) for non-payment of salary, 
travel allowance, and leave pay, as well as for payment of damages plus 
attorney's fees against his 
foreign principal employer Fairport Shipping Co., Ltd. (Fairport)
, its current local manning agency 
Stella Marris Shipmanagement, Inc. (Stella Marris)
,
[7]
 and officer 
Danilo Navarro (Navarro)

 (collectively, respondents). Orlanes alleged that Fairport employed him
 as Master on board the vessel M/V Orionis from August 4, 2009 to July 
24, 2010. Fairport, however, did not pay his salary, although they 
assured him that this will be paid in full upon disembarkation. Thus, he
 agreed to disembark from the vessel on July 27, 2010 without receiving 
his unpaid salary in the amount of US$8,819.73, travel allowance in the 
amount of US$59.57, and leave pay in the amount of US$5,680.26, or a 
total of US$14,559.56.
[8]
 Despite his demand, respondents refused to make the payment. Hence, his complaint.



In response,
[9]
 Stella Marris 
argued that it cannot be held liable for the aforementioned claims of 
Orlanes. While it had executed an Affidavit of Assumption of 
Responsibility, the same only pertained to the assumption of full and 
complete responsibility for all contractual obligations to the seafarers
 originally processed and recruited by its immediate predecessor, 
Global Gateway Crewing Services, Inc. (Global)
. Thus, since Orlanes was originally hired by 
Skippers United Pacific Inc. (Skippers)
,
 and that the obligations under his contract were transferred to Global 
and not assumed by Stella Marris, the latter cannot be held liable.



Notably, prior to the filing of the 
second
 complaint as aboveÂ­described, records show that Orlanes had earlier filed a complaint
[10]
 against Skippers, Fairport, and Jerosalem P. Fernandez (
first

 complaint). During the pendency thereof, Skippers filed a Motion to 
Implead and Substitute Global instead as the latter had executed an 
Affidavit of Assumption of Responsibilities
[11]

 dated May 9, 2011 in favor of Skippers, which was a requirement for the
 transfer of the accreditation of the vessel. A few months later, or on 
December 6, 2011, Global, however, filed an Urgent Motion to Re-Open and
 to Implead Stella Marris as the latter had executed its own Affidavit 
of Assumption of Responsibilities
[12]
 dated November 17, 2011 in favor of Global to facilitate the second transfer of the accreditation.
[13]
 Records fail to show if the said motion was acted upon.



Nonetheless, in view of the succeeding transfers of Fairport's manning 
agent from Skippers to Global, and Global to Stella Marris, the LA 
rendered a Decision
[14]
 dated December 29, 2011 dismissing the 
first
 complaint, without prejudice to Orlanes' refiling of the case against the alleged proper parties, 
i.e.
, Global, Fairport, and Stella Marris.



Aggrieved, Orlanes filed an appeal before the NLRC which was likewise dismissed in a Resolution
[15]

 dated March 20, 2012 due to his failure to sign the certificate of 
non-forum shopping. Orlanes no longer moved for reconsideration of the 
said Resolution.
[16]
 Thus, as the 
first
 complaint was dismissed without prejudice, Orlanes filed the 
second
 complaint before the LA against Fairport, Stella Marris, and/or Navarro, as respondents.
[17]


The LA Ruling



In a Decision
[18]
 dated May 31, 2013 (LA Decision), the LA granted the 
second

 complaint filed against herein respondents Fairport, Stella Marris, and
 Navarro. Accordingly, the LA held the three manning agencies, 
i.e.
,
 Skippers, Global, and Stella Marris, solidarily liable with Fairport to
 pay Orlanes the sum of US$14,559.56. Notably, while Skippers and Global
 were not impleaded as parties in the 
second
 complaint, the LA 
nonetheless found them liable. In particular, the LA found Skippers 
liable as signatory to the employment contract and Global as substitute 
manning agent which assumed full and complete responsibility for all 
contractual obligations to the seafarers originally recruited and 
processed by Skippers.
[19]



Dissatisfied, Stella Marris appealed
[20]
 to the NLRC.
[21]


The NLRC Ruling



In a Decision
[22]
 dated October 30, 2013, the NLRC set aside the LA Decision and instead dismissed the 
second

 complaint. It ruled that the LA erred in holding Skippers and Global 
solidarily liable with Fairport since they were not impleaded as parties
 in the 
second
 complaint. On the other hand, it found no basis to
 hold Stella Marris liable, considering that the latter was not the 
local manning agency which originally deployed Orlanes and it did not 
assume the liability of Skippers as the deploying agency. Rather, 
according to the NLRC, it was Skippers which should have been held 
liable pursuant to Section 10
[23]

 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8042, otherwise known as the "Migrant Workers 
and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995," as amended by RA 10022, which 
provides that the liability of the original manning agency continues 
during the entire period of the employment contract and is not affected 
by the transfers or substitutions of manning agencies. Finally, it 
observed that the liability assumed by Stella Marris under its Affidavit
 of Assumption of Responsibility pe11ained only to those employees 
originally recruited by Global, and not of Skippers, as Orlanes is in 
this case.
[24]



Unperturbed, Orlanes Inoved for reconsideration but was denied in a Resolution
[25]
 dated December 26, 2013. Thus, he filed a petition for 
certiorari
[26]
 before the CA, averring that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the 
second
 complaint.
[27]


The CA Ruling



In a Decision
[28]
 dated 
September 27, 2018, the CA agreed with the NLRC that it was Skippers, as
 Fairport's original manning agent, which should be held solidarily 
liable with Fairport for Orlanes' claims pursuant to Section 1 (e) (8), 
Rule II, Part II
[29]
 of the 
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) Rules and 
Regulations Governing the Recruitment and Employment of Seafarers (2003 
POEA Rules and Regulations) since its liability continued during the 
entire period of the employment contract and was not affected by the 
transfers or substitutions of manning agencies.
[30]
 Thus, although Fairport was a party in the 
second
 complaint, it proceeded to dismiss the 
certiorari
 petition.







 


Undaunted, Orlanes moved for reconsideration, which the CA denied in a Resolution
[31]
 dated March 1, 2019. Hence, this petition.


The Issue Before the Court




The issue before the Court is whether or not the CA erred in upholding 
the NLRC rulings dismissing Orlanes' monetary claims against 
respondents.


The Court's Ruling




The petition is partly meritorious.



Under Section 1 (e) (8), Rule II, Part II
[32]
 of the 2003 POEA Rules and Regulations, in relation to Section 10
[33]
 of RA 8042,
[34]
 otherwise known as the "Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995," as amended by RA 10022,
[35]

 the local manning agency assumes "joint and solidary liability with the
 employer for all claims and liabilities which may arise in connection 
with the implementation of the employment contract." This liability 
remains intact and extends up to and until the expiration of the 
employment contracts of the employees recruited and employed pursuant to
 the said agreement and covers any and all claims arising therefrom.



Section 10 of RA 8042 states that the solidary liability of the foreign principal and the recruitment agency to the employees "
shall not be affected by any substitution, amendment or modification made locally or in a foreign country of the said contract
." The rationale behind the rule was explicated in the case of 
Catan v. National Labor Relations Commission
,
[36]
 
viz
.:


This must be so, because the obligations covenanted in the 
recruitment agreement entered into by and between the local agent and 
its foreign principal are not coterminus with the term of such agreement
 so that if either or both of the parties decide to end the agreement, 
the responsibilities of such parties towards the contracted employees 
under the agreement do not at all end, but the same extends up to and 
until the expiration of the employment contracts of the employees 
recruited and employed pursuant to the said recruitment agreement. 
Otherwise, this will render nugatory the very purpose for which the law 
governing the employment of workers for foreign jobs abroad was enacted.
[37]



Thus, in 
Powerhouse Staffbuilders International, Inc. v. Rey
,
[38]

 the Court ruled that even if an Affidavit of Assumption of 
Responsibility was validly executed by the transferee agent assuming the
 full and complete responsibility over all contractual obligations of 
the principal to the seafarers originally recruited and processed by 
therein original manning agent, the latter's liability to its recruited 
workers remained intact because the said workers were not privy to such 
contract of transfer. Further, the Court pointed out that the original 
manning agent was the recruitment agency of the foreign principal that 
was stated in the seafarers' POEA-approved employment contracts, and 
hence, was contractually bound to fulfill its obligations to the 
seafarer.



Likewise, in 
Skippers United Pacific, Inc. v. Maguad
[39]

 - which notably involved the same Skippers manning agency in this case -
 the Court held that while the Affidavits of Assumption of 
Responsibility executed between Skippers, as the original manning 
agency, and the two other succeeding manning agencies were valid, said 
affidavits are not enforceable against the seafarers because they are 
not parties thereto. As such, citing Section 1 of Rule II of the 2003 
POEA Rules and Regulations, Skippers cannot exempt itself from all the 
seafarers' claims and liabilities arising from the implementation of the
 contract executed between them. Further, in view of the verified 
undertaking Skippers submitted to the POEA stating that it "shall assume
 joint and solidary liability with the employer for all claims and 
liabilities which may arise in connection with the implementation of the
 contract," it assured the aggrieved seafarers of immediate and 
sufficient payment of what is due them.



While the 2003 POEA Rules and Regulations allow the transfer of the 
registration and/or accreditation of the foreign principal to another 
local manning agency, which includes the transfer of the full and 
complete responsibility over all contractual obligations of the 
principal to the seafarers, the said transfer, however, covers only 
those contractual obligations to seafarers "
originally recruited and processed by the former agency
."
 This limitation is pursuant to the governing rule provided under 
Section 8, Rule I, Part III of the 2003 POEA Rules and Regulations on 
transfer of registration of principal and Section 7, Rule II, Part III 
of the same Rules on transfer of registration, which states:

 of the principal to the seafarers 
originally recruited and processed by the former agency
.
 Prior to the transfer of registration, the Administration shall notify 
the previous agency and principal of such application for transfer.

 The accreditation of a principal and/or enrolment of vessel may be

previous agency; and provided further that the transferee agency shall 
assume full and complete responsibility to all contractual obligations 
of the principals to its workers 
originally recruited and processed by the former agency
.
 Prior to the transfer of accreditation, the Administration shall notify
 the previous agency and principal of such application for transfer." 
(Emphases supplied)






In this case, there is no dispute that Skippers was the original manning
 agent of Fairport which recruited Orlanes and processed his employment 
with the former. As the accredited local manning agency for Fairport, 
Skippers assumed joint and solidary liability with the latter under the 
contract of employment of Orlanes as mandated by law.




However, pending Orlanes' 
first
 complaint against Skippers and 
Fairport before the NLRC, Fairport transferred its 
accreditation/registration to Global on May 9, 2011 in accordance with 
Section 8, Rule I, and Section 7, Rule II, Part III of the 2003 POEA 
Rules and Regulations. By virtue of the Affidavit of Assumption of 
Responsibilities that was executed by the Operations Manager of Global, 
Global assumed full and complete responsibility and without 
qualification all contractual obligations to the seafarers originally 
recruited and processed by Skippers for the vessel M/V Orionis. For this
 reason, Orlanes was therefore correct in impleading Global as party 
respondent in the 
first
 complaint together with Skippers, the original manning agent, and Fairport, as foreign principal.



However, in this case, there was a second transfer, which resulted (albeit erroneously) into the filing of a 
second

 complaint. In particular, Fairport once again changed and transferred 
its registration/accreditation, as well as the manning of its vessels to
 Stella Marris on November 17, 2011. Accordingly, an Affidavit of 
Assumption of Responsibilities was executed by Stella Marris covering 
those contractual obligations of Fairport that were "
originally processed and recruited by Global
."
 Notably, the limitation to Stella Marris' assumption of liability is 
consistent with the 2003 POEA Rules and Regulations which, as earlier 
mentioned, pertains only to the liability of the substitute manning 
agent to those contracts originally recruited by the transferor. Hence, 
considering that it was Skippers who originally recruited and processed 
Orlanes' employment and not Global, Stella Marris did not assume 
liability for Orlanes' claims under his contract with Skippers. In 
Abosta Ship Management v. Hilario
,
[40]

 the Court ruled that since it was the original manning agent which 
entered into the contract of employment with the worker for and in 
behalf of the foreign principal, it has the primary obligation to ensure
 the implementation of that contract in line with the policy of the 
state to protect and alleviate the plight of the working class,
[41]
 as Skippers in this case.



At this juncture, it should be pointed out that both Skippers and Global
[42]
 were not impleaded in the 
second

 complaint; hence, the Court cannot adjudge their respective liabilities
 to Orlanes in this case. While records show that Skippers and Global 
were impleaded in the 
first
 complaint, the same was unfortunately dismissed without prejudice by the LA. 
Indeed,
 in light of the discussions above, the LA gravely erred in dismissing 
the first complaint where Skippers, Global, and Fairport were already 
impleaded due to their respective legal/labilities with respect to his 
claim.
 Thus, considering the LA's mistake in dismissing the 
first

 complaint and so as not to cause Orlanes serious injustice absent any 
fault or wrongdoing, the Court deems it proper to remand the present 
case back to the LA in order to further implead both Skippers and Global
 as respondents together with Fairport, the original respondent.




To clarify, the foregoing course of action finds bearing in Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court,
[43]
 which provides that 
parties may be added by order of the court on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just
.
 In this relation, Section 3, Rule I of the 2011 NLRC Rules of 
Procedure, as amended, states that in the absence of any applicable 
provision in the Rules, the Rules of Court may, in the interest of 
expeditious dispensation of labor justice and whenever practicable and 
convenient, be applied in a suppletory character and effect.
[44]

 Since the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure is silent on the misjoinder and 
non-joinder of parties, and under the Rules of Court, such is 
not a ground for dismissal
 of the complaint but rather acknowledges the power of the court to add a party upon motion or 
on its own initiative at any stage of the action

 and/or such times as are just, the inclusion of Skippers and Global as 
party respondents in the present case is only just and appropriate. Once
 Skippers and Global, together with Fairport, are properly impleaded, 
the LA is directed to resolve Orlanes' monetary claim in the second 
complaint with utmost dispatch on its merits.

 Note that in a Resolution
 dated March 9, 2015, the CA ruled that Global was a party to the 
present case. However, the CA erred as mere participation in the first 
complaint before the LA should not be considered as participation in the
 present case. Records show that Global and Skippers were (
a
) not impleaded in the complaint; (
b
) not served summons; and, (
c
)
 not given an opportunity to be heard before the LA or the NLRC. 
Further, Global's participation in this case was limited to the filing 
of the Manifestation and Motion dated March 27, 2014 to the CA's Order 
to Comment on the Petition, its Comment dated March 15, 2015 to the 
petition, and its Memorandum dated September 8, 2015 before the CA.
