HERMINIO T. DISINI, PETITIONER, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the April 11, 2012 Decision
[2]
 and the October 24, 2012 Resolution
[3]
 of the 
Sandiganbayan

 in Civil Case No. 0013 which declared as ill-gotten the commissions 
received by Herminio T. Disini (Disini) relative to the Bataan Nuclear 
Power Plant (BNPP) project, and ordered him to account for and reconvey 
the total amount of $50,562,500.00, with interest until fully paid.
[4]

 In its assailed Resolution, the anti-graft court denied the Republic's 
Motion for Partial Reconsideration and Disini's Partial Motion for 
Reconsideration and Motion to Strike Out for lack of merit.
[5]


The Antecedents:


 This case involves the recovery of ill-gotten wealth against Disini,
 a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos (President 
Marcos), in relation to the BNPP project.
[6]

 The BNPP project is a nuclear power plant project awarded to 
Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Westinghouse) and Burns & Roe, 
Inc. (B&R), as main contract6r and architect-engineer, respectively,
 in 1976.
[7]
 The BNPP remains inoperable to this day.
[8]
 


On July 23, 1987, the Republic, through the Presidential Commission 
on Good Government (PCGG), filed a complaint for reconveyance, 
reversion, accounting, restitution and damages against Disini, President
 Marcos and Imelda Marcos (Imelda), for amassing ill-gotten wealth 
during President Marcos' term.
[9]

 Among others, the Republic alleged that Disini received special 
concessions from President Marcos in relation to the award of the BNPP 
contract to Westinghouse and B&R, for a scandalously exorbitant 
amount.
[10]
 Allegedly, Disini 
received substantial commissions from Westinghouse and B&R for the 
award of the contract and its execution.
[11]


 During trial, only the Republic presented evidence since Disini was a party in default:
[12]
 after summons to him remained unserved and after summons by publication against him was completed.
[13]

 The default order was sustained by this Court in a Decision rendered on
 July 5, 2010 which became final and executory on November 18, 2010.
[14]
 


The Republic presented the following witnesses 
ex parte
, 
namely: (a) Lourdes Magno, Information Technology Officer III of the 
PCGG; (b) Rodolfo B. Jacob (Jacob), former President of Herdis Group, 
Inc. (Herdis); (c) Danilo Richard V. Daniel, Director IV of the PCGG 
Research Department; (d) Angelo Manahan (Manahan), former Executive 
Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer of Herdis; (e) Rafael Sison, 
former member of the Board of Governors of the Development Bank of the 
Philippines (DBP); (f) Cristina A. Beranilla, PCGG Legal Assistant; (g) 
Ricardo Paras III, Chief State Counsel; (h) Atty. Jesus P. Disini 
(Jesus), second cousin of Disini and former Senior Vice-President of 
Herdis; and (i) Jesus Vergara (Vergara), former President of Asia 
Industries, Inc. (AII).
[15]
 
The Republic also presented the deposition of Rolando C. Gapud (Gapud), 
former officer of Bancom Development Corporation, former President of 
the Security Bank and Trust Company, and President Marcos and Imelda's 
financial advisor.
[16]


 However, Jesus' testimony was not given any probative value in view 
of his immunity agreement with the Republic that his affidavits were to 
be used solely for the New JerseyÂ· District Court (NJDC) case and the 
International Court of Arbitration (ICA) proceedings involving 
Westinghouse and B&R's claims against the Republic. This Court 
upheld the said immunity agreement in 
Disini v. Sandiganbayan
[17]

 which clearly prohibited the Republic from using him as a witness in 
anyÂ· claim brought by the Republic against Herminio Disini."


 The Republic also offered documentary evidence, such as Exhibits A 
to Z and series; AA to ZZ and series; AAA to ZZZ and series; and AAAA to
 DDDD and series.
[18]


Version of the Republic:
 


The Republic claimed that Westinghouse solicited the influence of 
Disini, a known close associate of President Marcos, to become its 
Special Sales Representative (SSR) to ensure its appointment as the main
 contractor for the BNPP project, for a fee of 3% of the contract price 
as commission.
[19]
 The 
Republic also alleged that Disini unduly took advantage of his close 
association with President Marcos to obtain favorable terms for 
Westinghouse by requesting President Marcos to issue orders or 
directives to the National Power Corporation (NPC) to accept 
Westinghouse's proposals in relation with the BNPP project.


Meanwhile, AII and Westinghouse entered into an agreement wherein the
 former would act as the latter's SSR in the Philippines for a fee of 
$3,000,000.
[20]
 Thereafter, 
Power Contractors, Inc. (PCI); a consortium entered into by Onofre B. 
Banson, Antonio P. Chanco, Vergara, Jose P. Dans, Jr., Rufino M. Asi, 
Ventura 0. Ducut, Claudio B. Altura, Lucio C. Torres, and Jacob, as 
stockholders, Monark International Inc., Vinnell-Belvoir Corporation, 
and Engineering Equipment, Inc., was formed to undertake the civil and 
other related works of the BNPP project.
[21]
 PCI was 40% owned by AII.
[22]
 


Thereafter, Disini, through his company Herdis, acquired Ail's 40% 
interest in PCI to gain and benefit from PCI's contract with 
Westinghouse.
[23]
 Also, he acquired AII to benefit from the latter's SSR agreement with Westinghouse.
[24]

 The Republic claimed that all commissions due to AII was directly paid 
by Westinghouse to Disini, through Herdis, and not to All which resulted
 in the latter's financial distress.


On the other hand, B&R had a written agreement with Technosphere 
Consultant Group, Inc. (TCI), a company owned by Herdis. Pursuant to 
their agreement, TCI would receive a commission of 10% of the contract 
price of B&R as the architect-engineer in the BNPP project. This 
commission was for the services rendered by Disini in influencing 
President Marcos to award the BNPP project to B&R as 
architect-engineer.


Both Westinghouse and B&R made their payments to Disini beginning
 1976. However, these commissions were not recorded in the books of 
Herdis, Ail or TCL Instead, they were remitted by Westinghouse and 
B&R to a certain Rene Pasche in Switzerland who deposited the money 
in Disini's Switzerland bank accounts. However, inÂ· 1978, Westinghouse 
started to remit the commissions through the International Corporate 
Bank (Interbank) in the Philippines in which Disini and Jacob were the 
authorized signatories. A substantial portion of the Interbank account 
was then deposited in the overseas bank accounts in Switzerland under 
the account names "965 Summa" and "735 Phil" with Disini's wife, 
Pacencia, and Jacob as the authorized signatories.
[25]


Sandigan
 Decision


 On April 11, 2012, the 
Sandiganbayan
 rendered its assailed 
Decision declaring the commissions in the amount of $50,562,500.00 
received by Disini to be ill-gotten wealth
[26]
 and ordering him to account for and reconvey the said amount to the Republic.
[27]
 The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads: 


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, judgment is hereby 
rendered DECLARING ILL-GOTTEN the commissions received by defendant 
HERMINIO T. DISINI in connection with the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant 
transaction. Defendant Disini is ordered to ACCOUNT for these 
commissions and to RECONVEY the total amount of $50,562,500.00 he 
received by virtue of this transaction to the Plaintiff, with interest 
until fully paid. Plaintiff's claims for actual, moral, temperate, 
nominal, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and 
treble judicial costs are DISMISSED for not being established by a 
preponderance of evidence.
[28]


Notably, only Disini was found liable by the 
Sandiganbayan
 of 
having amassed ill-gotten wealth by way of substantial commissions 
totaling $50,562,500.00 which he received from Westinghouse and B&R 
in connection with the BNPP project. The 
Sandiganbayan
 found 
Disini to be a close personal and business associate of President Marcos
 based on the following: his appearances in MalacaÃ±ang to play golf 
together with a select group of people, several phone calls from 
President Marcos himself, submission of 
aide memoires
 to 
President Marcos which contained information relating to the business 
development of Herdis, and various requests to President Marcos for the 
approval of his loans from government banks and other requests for the 
benefit of his companies.
[29]


In ruling for the Republic, the 
Sandiganbayan
 relied on the testimonies of witnesses Manahan, Vergara, and Jacob, all of whom were privy to the BNPP project.
[30]
 It held that the evidence presented by the Republic established the following:


 Disini, as the owner of Herdis and a known close associate and 
family friend of President Marcos, served as an SSR of Westinghouse
[31]
 and B&R
[32]
 in exchange for substantial commissions totaling $50,562,500.00.
[33]

 As Westinghouse and B&R's SSR, Disini used his personal and close 
association with President Marcos to ensure that the BNPP project would 
be awarded to Westinghouse and B&R.
[34]

 In addition, Disini sought private concessions from President Marcos in
 the form of orders which favored and allowed Westinghouse and B&R to continue with the BNPP project despite unfavorable terms against the 
Philippines.
[35]


In arriving at the total amount of commissions received by Disini from Westinghouse and B&R, the 
Sandiganbayan
 primarily relied on Exhibit E-9,
[36]

 Disini's purported summary of the total commissions from Westinghouse 
and B&R in relation to the BNPP project. The Anti-Graft Court found 
no probative value on the documentary evidence relating to the existence
 of Disini's Switzerland bank accounts to prove receipt of commissions 
as they were mere photocopies, unauthenticated and not properly 
translated.


Nonetheless, the 
Sandiganbayan
 ruled that even if most of the 
documentary evidence were photocopies with no probative value, the 
testimonies of Manahan, Vergara, Jacob and Sison constituted 
preponderant evidence that: (a) Disini and President Marcos were close 
associates, or relatives by affinity; (b) President Marcos acquiesced 
to Disini's representation as the exclusive agent for Westinghouse and 
B&R with respect to the BNPP project; (c) Westinghouse and B&R 
agreed to pay commission to Disini for the latter to influence President
 Marcos to award the contracts to them; and (d) Disini, did in fact, 
receive these commissions.


 However, while the 
Sandiganbayan
 found, Disini liable, it held that there was no evidence of President Marcos' and Imelda's receipt of the commissions.
[37]
 Thus, they were not held liable.
[38]
 


Both parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration. The 
Republic argued that it sufficiently proved that anop1alous grants of 
loans and guarantees were given to the companies owned by President 
Marcos and Disini through Presidential Decree (P.D.) Nos. 550 and 750; 
and Letter of Instruction (LOI) Nos. 658 and 1132. It insisted that 
President Marcos and Disini misappropriated, embezzled and converted 
funds of government financial institutions by granting unwarranted 
favors to Herdis. It likewise alleged that President Marcos accumulated 
ill-gotten wealth in conspiracy with Disini, thus, he should also be 
held liable for the receipt of commissions from Westinghouse and B&R
 in relation to the BNPP project. Lastly, it claimed that it is entitled
 to actual, temperate, nominal and exemplary damages, attorney's fees 
and other judicial costs.


 On the other hand, Disini opined that the Republic had no cause of 
action against him as there was no contract or quasi-contract violated. 
Also, he alleged that witnesses Manahan, Vergara and Jacob had no 
personal knowledge of the allegations in their affidavits. Specifically,
 he cited Manahan's Transcripts of Stenographic Notes (TSN) in Criminal 
Case No. 28001-02
[39]
 filed before the 
Sandiganbayan

 which showed his lack of personal knowledge on matters alleged in his 
affidavit. Also, he insisted that he did not take undue advantage of his
 alleged close relationship with President Marcos for personal gain or 
benefit. Lastly, no evidence was adduced to prove the amount of 
commissions he allegedly received from Westinghouse and B&R.


On October 24, 2012, the Sandiganbayan denied both the Republic's 
Motion for Partial Reconsideration and Disini's Partial Motion for 
Reconsideration and Motion to Strike Out for lack of merit.
[40]

 It ruled that Disini, having been declared in default, cannot present 
as evidence Manahan's TSN in Criminal Case Nos. 28001-02 in a motion for
 reconsideration.


 As a party in default, Disini lost his right to present evidence and
 to participate in the trial by filing a Motion to Strike Out. Thus, the
 
Sandiganbayan
 ruled that it is not bound to recognize the said Motion to Strike Out filed by Disini or to act on it.


As to the Republic's motion for partial reconsideration, the 
Sandiganbayan

 held that i:t failed to present credible evidence to prove the 
accumulation of ill-gotten wealth by President Marcos, Imelda and Disini
 based on P.D.s and LOI issued by President Marcos. The anti-graft court
 noted that the Republic did not offer any evidence to prove the 
specific amounts of loans or other accommodations granted by President 
Marcos to Disini.


 It opined that the Republic; should not expect the 
Sandiganbayan

 to make its own investigation to determine the particular loan amounts 
or accommodations and favorable treatment granted to Disini by President
 Marcos based on P.D. Nos. 550 and 750 as well as LOI Nos. 658 and 1132.
 As to the damages claimed by the Republic, the 
Sandiganbayan
 ruled that there was no factual basis for the award of moral, temperate, nominal and exemplary damages.
[41]
 


As to Disini's motion for partial reconsideration, the Sandiganbayan
 ruled that Jacob's testimony proved that Disini indeed received 
commissions from Westinghouse and B&R for his services rendered 
regarding the award of the BNPP project to them. Absent any 
countervailing evidence, Jacob's testimony deserved probative weight 
despite the lack of documentary proof. However, the Sandiganbayan 
maintained its ruling that there was no sufficient evidence to show that
 President Marcos and Imelda received any commissions from Westinghouse 
and B&R.
[42]
 


Hence, Disini filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari 
under Rule 45. Meanwhile, on June 3, 2014, Disini died and was 
substituted in the suit by his heir Herminio Angel E. Disini, Jr.
[43]


Issues


Disini raised the following issues
[44]
 in his Petition:


1. Whether the 
Sandiganbayan
 violated the rule on 
authentication of documents under Section 120 of Ru1e 132 of the Rules 
of Court when it admitted and relied on Republic's Exhibit E-9. x x x


2. Whether there [was] a civil law cause of action that justifie[d] the 
Sandiganbayan
's [order] to account for and reconvey,to the Republic the sum of $50,562,500.00. x x x 


3. Whether the 
Sandiganbayan
 violated Section 14 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution when it concluded that the Westinghouse contract exist[ed]. x x x


4. Whether the 
Sandiganbayan
 violated Section 14 of Article 
VIII of the [1987 Constitution] when it concluded that [Disini] received
 the sum of $50,562,500.00. x x x


First
, Disini claims that the 
Sandiganbayan
 disregarded
 the rule on authentication of documents when it admitted and relied on 
Exhibit E-9, a private document attached to Manahan's affidavit, to 
arrive at the amount of $50,562,500.00.
[45]
 According to Disini, no one authenticated, signed, nor identified Exhibit E-9.
[46]
 Further, Exhibit E-9 was allegedly disowned by Manahan during the taking of his deposition in separate criminal cases.
[47]
 


However, the Sandiganbayan refused to consider Manahan's deposition 
on the ground that Disini was a party in default. Disini contends that 
the antiÂ­-graft court should not have ignored evidence which was 
presented in a related case lest it violate the fundamental rule of 
fairness and deny the defaulting party due process of law.


Moreover, Disini argues that the 
Sandiganbayan
 simply cannot 
infer from or use the amounts indicated in Exhibit E-9 as there was 
nothing in the said document which would suggest that the amounts 
represented the commissions paid to Disini. No other evidence was 
presented to prove that actual payments were made.


Besides, the Republic did not offer as evidence the Westinghouse and 
B&R contracts which would be the best evidence to prove the amount 
of commissions. The 
Sandiganbayan
 cannot take judicial notice of 
the: (1) contracts of the BNPP project; (2) consideration therefor; (3) 
commission agreements related thereto; and (4) payments to Westinghouse 
by the Republic or the commissions actually received by Disini.


Also, the witnesses presented had no personal knowledge of the 
Westinghouse and B&R contracts. In fact, Vergara testified that he 
was not present during the negotiation of the final draft of the 
contract and the signing thereof. Even Jacob did not categorically 
testify that the amounts he remitted pertained to commissions from 
certain contract as he had no personal knowledge that the said 
commissions were related to particular transactions. 


Second
, Disini alleges that there was no civil law cause of action that justified the 
Sandiganbayan
's directive to account for and reconvey to the Republic the sum of $50,562,500.00.
[48]

 Disini claims that he was never a public official, hence, he ould not 
be held liable for breach of public trust. There was also no evidence to
 prove that the alleged commissions he received were part of the 
purchase price paid by the Republic to Westinghouse and B&R relating
 to the BNPP project.


Disini cites the rulings' of the two (2) foreign tribunals, namely, 
the NJDC and the ICA, which found that no bribery attended the execution
 of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts, respectively. Both the NJDC 
and the ICA found no evidence that Disini acted as agent to secure the 
award of the BNPP project to Westinghouse and B&R; neither was there
 any evidence to prove that President Marcos received commissions from 
the said contracts.


Furthermore, Disini asserts that he could not be held liable for 
breach of trust without a public officer being also held liable as a 
conspirator. The reliance of the 
Sandiganbayan
 on Executive Order
 (EO) Nos. 1, 2 and 14-A was misplaced as these EOs did not create a 
civil cause of action but merely authorized the PCGG to undertake the 
recovery of ill-gotten wealth and vest the 
Sandiganbayan
 with jurisdiction thereon. No law was mentioned upon which to base the cause of action for the reconveyance of $50,562,500.00. 


Third
, Disini maintains that the 
Sandiganbayan
 violated
 Section 14 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution when it concluded 
that the Westinghouse contract existed even though it was never 
produced, presented nor seen by any witnesses.
[49]
 The 
Sandiganbayan

 accepted as a fact the existence of the Westinghouse and B&R 
contracts without any documentary proof presented by the Republic.


Disini also insists that the Republic can no longer assail the 
validity of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts as the ICA and NJDC 
decisions found no illegalities in their procurement, award, negotiation
 and execution. The Republic cannot relitigate the same issue as it is 
bound by the foreign decisions.


Finally
, Disini avers that the 
Sandiganbayan
 violated 
Section 14 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution when it concluded 
that he received the sum of $50,562,500.00, despite lack of proof 
thereof.
[50]
 He contends that 
Jacob did not specifically quantify the total commissions he allegedly 
received. The absence of the specific amount precludes a conclusion that
 he actually received commissions from Westinghouse and B&R.


Also, Jacob did not identify all the documents attached to his 
affidavit. He merely mentioned Exhibit 3 as an example, but the said 
document pertained to Herdis and TCI and did not indicate Disini as the 
recipient or payee of the alleged remittance. No bank documents were 
presented by the Republic to show the remittances to his accounts 
Interbank, as well as the subsequent transfers to his accounts in 
Switzerland and other places. Disini argues that the 
Sandiganbayan

 failed to explicitly state the facts upon which its conclusion that he 
received $50,562,500.00 were based in violation of due process and 
Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution.

In its July 29, 2013 Comment,
[51]
 the Republic argued that it has valid civil causes of action against Disini
[52]
 Since the complaint was for recovery of illÂ­-gotten wealth, it was founded on EO Nos. 1, 2 and -14-A (1986).
[53]

 The PCGG was tasked to recover ill-gotten wealth amassed by President 
Marcos, his close relatives, subordinates, business associates, dummies,
 agents, or nominees. Under EO No. 14-A, the PCGG, with the assistance 
of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and other government 
agencies, is empowered to file and prosecute all ill-gotten wealth cases
 investigated by it under EO Nos. 1 and 2.


The Republic further argued that despite the fact that Disini was not
 a public official or fiduciary agent of the government, his receipt of 
substantial commissions by reason of his influence and close relationship
 with President Marcos constitutes grave abuse of right and power 
resulting in unjust enrichment and causing grave damage and prejudice to
 the Republic and the Filipinos.


The Republic also maintains that the 
Sandiganbayan
 correctly relied on Exhibit E-9 in arriving at the amount of $50,562,500.00 since Manahan attested to its veracity.
[54]

 Exhibit E-9, a one-page tabulation of commissions received by Disini 
typed on his stationery, forms part of Manahan's affidavit. While the 
amount of $50,562,500.00 is not expressly stated in Exhibit E-9, a 
simple addition of the amounts listed in Items I to IV would sum up to 
$50,562,500.00. Exhibit E-9 was identified by Manahan in his direct 
examination where he declared that he fully understood the contents of 
his affidavit and attested to the veracity of all its annexes attached 
thereto.


Further, considering that Disini was in default, heis barred from 
presenting evidence such as witness Manahan's alleged disavowal of 
Exhibit E-9 in Criminal Case Nos. 28001-02.
[55]

 As a consequence of the default order, Disini can no longer present his
 own evidence and therefore cannot invoke Manahan's deposition in 
Criminal Case Nos. 28001 and 28002 pending before the 
Sandiganbayan
.


As to the existence of the Westinghouse contract and Disini's receipt
 of the commissions, the Republic argues that both were satisfactorily 
established by the testimonies of witnesses Jacob, Manahan and Vergara.
[56]

 In particular, the testimonies of Manahan and Vergara as to the 
existence of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts are entitled to 
great weight because of their credibility and close business 
relationship with Disini. Also, Disini is estopped from questioning the 
existence of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts as he himself 
invoked the decisions of the NJDC and ICA. In effect, he admitted the 
existence of the said contracts.


Lastly, the Republic alleges that Disini's petition should be dismissed as it was filed out of time.
[57]
 Disini received a copy of the 
Sandiganbayan
's
 Resolution dated October 24, 2012 on November 7, 2012. Under Section 2,
 Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, Disini had only 15 days from November 7,
 2012, or until November 22, 2013 within which to file a petition for 
review on 
certiorari
. However, Disini filed his petition more 
than two (2) months from November 22, 2012. Hence, this petition was 
clearly filed out of time or as a mere afterthought.


In his January 21, 014 Reply,
[58]

 Disini reiterates the following: (a) Exhibit E-9 is unreliable, 
incompetent and unauthenticated which should not have been relied upon 
by the 
Sandiganbayan
 in computing his alleged commissions; (b) 
the Republic has no legal basis to account for the amount of 
$50,562,500.00 as he did not violate any of its rights under EO Nos. 1, 2
 and 14-A; (c) the 
Sandiganbayan
 should not have ignored witness Manahan's disavowal of Exhibit E-9 in Criminal Case Nos. 28001-02;
[59]
 and (d) the 
Sandiganbayan

 should have required the Republic to present the Westinghouse and 
B&R contracts and Disini's alleged SSR agreements. Lastly, he opined
 that procedural rules should be liberally applied and that the instant 
petition should be given due course as it is of transcendental 
importance.


After the parties' submission of their respective memoranda, the case was submitted for resolution.
[60]


Our Ruling


We grant the Petition in part.


The issues raised by Disini will be discussed into two (2) parts, 
viz
.:
 (I) whether the Republic, through the PCGG and the assistance of the 
OSG, has a cause of action against Disini in relation to the recovery of
 substantial commissions he received from Westinghouse and B&R; and 
(II) whether there is preponderance of evidence to prove that Disini is 
liable to account for and reconvey the ill-gotten wealth he acquired 
from Westinghouse and B&R in relation with the BNPP project.


I
           
The case is founded on EO Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A (1986).
 
 
Section 1(d) of the Freedom Constitution
[61]

 mandates the President to continue the exercise of legislative power 
until a legislature is elected and convened under a New Constitution. It
 vests in the President the power and duty to enact measures to achieve 
the mandate of the people, among others, "the [recovery] of ill-gotten 
properties amassed by the leaders and supporters of the previous regime 
and protect the interest of the people through orders of sequestration 
or freezing of assets of accounts."
[62]

 Hence, then President Corazon C. Aquino (Pres. Aquino) issued EO No. 1 
creating the PCGG with the task of assisting the President in regard to:


(a) The recovery of all ill-gotten wealth accumulated
 by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, 
relatives, subordinates and close associates, whether located in the 
Philippines or abroad, including the takeover or sequestration of all 
business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by them, during 
his administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue 
advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, 
influence, connections or relationship.

(b) The investigation of such cases of graft and corruption as the President may assign to the Commission from time to time.


(c) The adoption of safeguards to ensure that the above practices 
shall not be repeated in any manner under the new government, and the 
institution of adequate measures to prevent the occurrence of 
corruption.
[63]


Further, EO No. 2
[64]
 was issued enjoining the following:


(1) Freeze all assets and properties in the Philippines 
in which former President Marcos and/or his wife, Mrs. Imelda Romualdez 
Marcos, their close relatives, subordinates, business associates, 
dummies,' agents, or nominees have any interest or participation.


(2) Prohibit any person from transferring, conveying, encumbering or 
otherwise depleting or concealing such assets and properties or from 
assisting or taking part in their transfer, encumbrance, concealment, or
 dissipation under pain of such penalties as are Prescribed by law.


(3) Require all persons in the Philippines holding such assets or 
properties, whether located in the Philippines or abroad, in their names 
as nominees, agents or trustees, to make full disclosure of the same to 
the Presidential Commission on Good Government within (30) days from 
publication of this Executive Order, or the substance thereof, in at 
least two (2) newspapers of general circulation in the Philippines.


(4) Prohibit former President Ferdinand Marcos and/or his wife, 
Imelda Romualdez Marcos, their close relatives, subordinates, business 
associates, dummies, agents, or nominees from transferring, conveying, 
encumbering, concealing or dissipating said assets or properties in the 
Philippines and abroad, pending the outcome of appropriate proceedings 
in the Philippines to determine whether any such assets or properties 
were acquired by them through or as a result of improper or illegal use 
of or the conversion of funds belonging to the Government of the 
Philippines or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, 
banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of their 
official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to 
unjustly enrich themselves at the expense and to the grave damage and 
prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.
[65]


Thereafter, EO No. 14 was issued directing the PCGG to file all such cases, whether civil or criminal, with the 
Sandiganbayan

 to recover all assets and properties illegally acquired or 
misappropriated by President Marcos, Imelda, their close relatives, 
subordinates, business associates, dummies, agents or nominees. Further,
 EO No. 14-A decreed that civil suits to recover unlawfully acquired 
property under Republic Act No. 1379 or for the restitution, reparation 
of damages, or indemnification for consequential and other damages or 
any other civil actions under the Civil Code or other existing laws 
filed with the Sandiganbayan against President Marcos, Imelda, their 
close relatives and associates, may proceed independently of any 
criminal proceedings and may be proved by preponderance of evidence.
[66]


Verily, the Freedom Constitution and EO Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A 
confirm the authority and duty given to the PCGG to file the instant 
action against Disini for recovery of his alleged ill-gotten wealth 
relative to the BNPP project. Thus, contrary to Disini's contention the
 Republic, through the PCGG, has a valid cause of action against him. EO
 No. 1, founded on the Freedom Constitution, explicitly tasked the PCGG 
to assist in the recovery of ill-gotten wealth. EO Nos. 2, 14 and 14-A 
further defined and bolstered the duties of the PCGG in the exercise of 
its mandate. There is no doubt, therefore, that the Republic, through 
the PCGG, has a clear-cut cause to file the present suit against Disini 
in view of his alleged involvement in the BNPP project through receipt 
of substantial commissions from Westinghouse and B&R for influencing
 President Marcos in their favor.


Furthermore, it is clear from the Amended Complaint
[67]
 that the action is one for 
recovery of ill-gotten wealth
:




I. NATURE OF THE ACTION


1. This is a civil action against Defendants Herminia T. Disini, 
Rodolfo Jacob, Rafael A. Sison, Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos
 
to recover from them ill-gotten wealth consisting of funds and other property

 which they, in unlawful concert with one another, had acquired and 
accumulated in flagrant breach of trust and of their fiduciary as public
 officers, with grave abuse of right and power and in brazen violation 
of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines, thus 
resulting in their unjust enrichment during Defendant Ferdinand E. 
Marcos' 20 years of rule from December 30, 1965 to February 25, 1986, 
first as President of the Philippines under the 1935 Constitution and, 
thereafter, as one-man ruler under martial law and Dictator under the 
1973 Marcos-promulgated Constitution.

[68]
 (Emphases supplied)


The allegations in the Amended Complaint clearly show that Disini is 
being sued for amassing ill-gotten wealth. Indeed, as will be further 
discussed hereafter, the commissions received by Disini from 
Westinghouse and B&R are ill-gotten wealth which necessitate the 
filing of this action.


The PCGG Rules and Regulations define ill-gotten wealth as follows:


SECTION 1. Definition. - (A) 
"Ill-gotten wealth"
 is hereby defined as 
any
 asset, property, business enterprise or material possession of persons
 within the purview of Executive Orders Nos. 1 and 2, acquired by them 
directly, or indirectly thru dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates 
and/or business associates by any of the following means or similar 
schemes:


(1) Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;


(2) Through the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any 
commission, gift, share, percentage, kickbacks or any other form of 
pecuniary benefit from any person and/or entity in connection with any 
government contract or project or by reason of the office or position of
 the official concerned.


(3) By the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets 
belonging to the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 
instrumentalities or government-owned or controlled corporations;


(4) By obtaining, receiving or accepting directly or indirectly any 
shares of stock, equity, or any other form of interest or participation 
in any business enterprise or undertaking;


(5) Through the establishment of agricultural, industrial or 
commercial monopolies or other combination and/or by the issuance, 
promulgation and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to 
benefit particular persons or special interests; and


(6) By taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship or influence for personal gain or benefit
.
[69]
 (Emphasis supplied)


In 
Republic v. Sandiganbayan
,
[70]

 ill-gotten wealth is defined as the "vast resources of the government" 
amassed by President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives and close 
associates, to wit:


Although E.O. No. 1 and the other issuances dealing with ill-Â­gotten wealth (
i.e
.,
 E.O. No. 2, E.O. No. 14, and E.O. No. 14-A) only identified the subject 
matter of ill-gotten wealth and the persons who could amass illÂ­-gotten 
wealth and did not include an explicit definition of 
ill-gotten wealth, we can still discern the meaning and concept of ill-gotten wealth
 from the WHEREAS Clauses themselves of E.O. No. 1, in that 
illÂ­-gotten wealth consisted of the "
vast resources of the government
"
 amassed by "former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family,
 relatives and close associates both here and abroad." It is clear, 
therefore, that 
ill-gotten wealth
 would not include all the 
properties of President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and 
close associates but only the part that originated from the "vast 
resources Â·of the government
."
[71]
 (Emphasis supplied)


In 
Bataan Shipyard & Engineering Co., Inc. v. Presidential Commission on Good Government
[72]
 and P
residential Commission on Good Government v. Tan
,
[73]

 We defined ill-gotten wealth as those "acquired through or as a result 
of improper or illegal use of or the conversion of funds belonging to 
the Government or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, 
banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of 
official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence, 
resulting in unjust enrichment of the ostensible owner and grave damage 
and prejudice to the State."
[74]


Furthermore, in 
Chavez v. Presidential Commission on Good Government
,
[75]

 ill-gotten wealth is defined as those "assets and properties 
purportedly acquired, directly or indirectly, by former President 
Marcos, his immediate family, relatives and close associates through or 
as a result of their improper or illegal use of government funds or 
properties; or their having taken undue advantage of their public 
office; or their use of powers, influence or relationships, resulting in
 their unjust enrichment and causing grave damage and prejudice to the 
Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines."
[76]


In sum, in order to be considered as ill-gotten wealth, they must 
have: (a) originated from the government; and (b) been taken by former 
President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates 
by illegal means.
[77]


 Evidently, the BNPP is a government project the construction of 
which was awarded to Westinghouse as the main contractor and B&R as 
the architect-engineer, allegedly through undue advantage of Disini's 
influence and close association with President Marcos. In exchange, 
Disini allegedly received substantial commissions based on 3% and 10% of
 the total contract price from Westinghouse and B&R, respectively. 
Obviously, the payment of the alleged commissions would be coming from 
Westinghouse and B&R, which are private corporations, and not 
directly from the government.


However, contrary to the contention of Disini, ill-gotten wealth also
 encompasses those that are derived indirectly from government funds or 
properties through the use of power, influence, or relationship 
resulting in unjust enrichment and causing grave damage and prejudice to
 the Filipino people and the Republic. The alleged subject commissions 
may not have been sourced directly from the public funds but it is 
beyond cavil that Disini would not have amassed these commissions had he
 not exerted undue influence on President Marcos.


 Disini indirectly and unjustly enriched himself through his 
influence and close association with President Marcos by ensuring that 
the BNPP project would be awarded to Westinghouse and B&R. Besides, 
his alleged receipt of commissions from Westinghouse and B&R is 
clearly within the definition of ill-gotten wealth under the PCGG Rules 
and Regulations, that is, the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any 
commission from an entity in connection with any government contract or 
project.


Disini's argument that he may not be held liable since he was not a 
public officer, or that there was no finding of conspiracy between him 
and President Marcos, deserves scant consideration. Suffice it to say 
that EO Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A (1986) clearly provide that ill-gotten 
wealth may be recovered from President Marcos' immediate family, 
relatives, subordinates and close associates, notwithstanding their 
private status. Undoubtedly, the Republic may recover ill-gotten wealth 
not only from President Marcos, Imelda and his immediate family but also
 from his dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates and/or business 
associates whether or not President Marcos is also found liable together
 with them.


In light of the above issuances authorizing the recovery of 
ill-gotten wealth, there is no doubt that the Republic has a valid cause
 of action founded in EO Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A (1986). 




II


We now come to the issue of whether the Republic has proved by 
preponderance of evidence its allegations that Disini should be held 
liable and made to account for and reconvey his ill-gotten wealth 
consisting of the substantial commissions he received from Westinghouse 
and B&R relative to the BNPP project. To resolve this matter, the 
Court needs to review and evaluate the evidence presented by the 
Republic which is generally not allowed in a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45.


Procedural matters:


As a general rule, the Court's jurisdiction in a, Rule 45 petition is limited to the review of pure questions of law.
[78]
 Rule 45 does not allow the review of questions of fact because the Court is not a trier of facts.
[79]
 


A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on
 a certain state of facts, while a question of fact exists when there is
 doubt as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.
[80]

 The test in determining whether a question is one of law or of fact is 
whether the appellate court can resolve the issue raised without 
reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of
 law.
[81]
 Any question that 
invites evaluation of the whole evidence, as well as their relation to 
each other and to the whole, is a question of fact and thus proscribed 
in a Rule 45 petition.
[82]
 


The rule however admits of exceptions: 


(1) [W]hen the findings are grounded entirely on 
speculations, surmises, or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is 
manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; (3) when there is a grave 
abuse of discretion; 
(4) when the judgment is based on misappreciation of facts
;
 (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when in making its 
findings, the same are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and 
appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to those of the trial 
court; 
(8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based
;
 (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the 
petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; 
and 
(10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record
.
[83]
 (Emphases supplied)


Here, Disini raised the issues on the authenticity of Exhibit E-9, 
the existence or absence of Westinghouse and B&R contracts, and the 
actual receipt and amount of commissions from Westinghouse and B&R. 
Clearly, these issues involve questions of facts. They relate to the 
probative weight of Exhibit E-9, the existence of the Westinghouse and 
B&R contracts, and the commission agreements, and Disini's receipt 
of the sum of $50,562,500.00.
[84]

 Precisely, these issues require a judicious review of all the evidence 
presented in this case. Thus, these issues are not proper in a Rule 45 
petition.


 Nevertheless, We find that the circumstances in the instant case 
warrant the application of the exception rather than the general rule, 
as will be discussed below.           
Existence of Westinghouse and B&R contracts and commission agreements.
 
 
The alleged commissions received by Disini, 
i.e.
, 3% and 10%, 
were supposedly based on the total contract price of the Westinghouse 
and B&R contracts, respectively. However, Disini avers that the 
records are bereft of any evidence as to the existence of these 
contracts and their corresponding commission agreements. In fact, the 
Sandiganbayan

 anchored its decision as to existence of these contracts and commission
 agreements on the testimonies of Vergara and Jacob who narrated how the
 BNPP contract was awarded to Westinghouse and B&R and how Disini 
used his close personal relationship with President Marcos to obtain 
substantial concessions.


Under the Best Evidence Rule under Section 3, Rule 130 of the Rules 
of Court, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original 
document when the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, to 
wit: 


Section 3. 
Original document must be produced, exceptions
.
 - When the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no 
evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself, 
except in the following cases:


(a) When the original has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, without bad faith on the part of the offeror;


(b) When the original is in the custody or under control of the party
 against whom the evidence is offered, and the latter fails to produce 
it after reasonable notice;


 (c) When the original consists of numerous accounts or other 
documents which cannot be examined in court without great loss of time 
and the fact sought to be established from them is only the general 
result of the whole; and


 (d) When the original is a public record in the custody of a public officer or is recorded in a public office.


The rule's purpose is to ensure that the exact contents of a writing are brought before the court,
[85]
 to act as an insurance against fraud
[86]

 and to protect against misleading inferences resulting from the 
intentional or unintentional introduction of selected portions of a 
larger set of writings.
[87]
 
However, when the evidence sought to be introduced concerns external 
facts, such as the existence, execution or delivery of the writing, 
without reference to its terms, the Best Evidence Rule cannot be 
invoked.
[88]
 In such case, secondary evidence may be admitted even without presenting the original.


 In the present case, the Republic claims to have proved the 
existence of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts in relation to the 
BNPP project as well as the existence of their corresponding commission 
agreements with Disini.


We agree with the Republic. As to the proof of the existence of the 
Westinghouse and B&R contracts in relation to the BNPP project as 
well as the existence of their corresponding commission agreements with 
Disini, We hold that it was-sufficiently established by the testimonies 
of Vergara and Jacob. Despite the non-presentation of the original 
contracts themselves, the Republic has duly proved their execution, to 
wit: 


Affidavit of Vergara dated November 15, 1988

2. Approximately in 1973, at about the time of the oil embargo, 
Westinghouse saw the opportunity to promote nuclear power in the 
Philippines. I discussed the subject on many occasions with Mr. L.P. 
Sabol, the Westinghouse Power Systems District Manager stationed in 
Manila, and later with Mr. L.C. Saunders, the Westinghouse 
Vice-President, Power Systems-Far East, stationed in Hongkong. 
Westinghouse was very anxious to obtain a contract for the first nuclear
 plant project in the Philippines. However, Westinghouse had recently 
lost in the bidding for the Malaya II power plant project in the 
Philippines, and they suspected that they lost because Westinghouse 
lacked influence with President Marcos. 
We decided not to make the
 same mistake in connection with the nuclear project, and we therefore 
set about recruiting someone close to President Marcos to serve as our 
"Special Sales Representative" (SSR)
.


 3. Mr. Sabol and I spent some time considering who should be 
approached to act as the westinghouse SSR. I first contacted Dr. 
Pacifico Marcos, the brother of President Marcos. Dr. Marcos declined to
 act as SSR because he knew nothing about electric power plants or the 
nuclear project and believed that the President might question his 
involvement. 
Sometime later I was having breakfast at Wack-Wack 
golf club when I saw Herminio T. Disini. I knew that Disini was a close 
family friend of President Marcos and that his wife was the personal 
physician and cousin of Imelda Marcos. I therefore decided to approach 
Disini to see if he would serve as SSR.
 


4. Herminio Disini was initially unenthusiastic about my proposal 
because he, like Pacifico Marcos, knew nothing about nuclear power. 
Disini's attitude seemed to change, however, when I reminded him that 
the project could cost as much as $600 million, yielding a commission in
 the range of $30 million. Disini suggested a meeting, and I brought Mr.
 Sabol to Disini's office that same day. Mr. Sabol gave Disini some 
Westinghouse brochures and explained the nuclear project. 
The 
meeting ended with Disini promising to give us an answer within one 
week. Less than a week later Disini called to say that he would be 
interested in acting as the Westinghouse SSR for the nuclear project. 
When he accepted appointment as SSR, I knew that the project would be 
awarded to Westinghouse. Mr. Disini would not have accepted appointment 
unless it had been cleared with Mr. Marcos. I told this to Mr. Sabol. It
 then became necessary to secure Westinghouse management approval of 
Disini's appointment as SSR and to set the financial arrangement with 
him
. Mr. Saunders came to Manila for that purpose and met with 
Disini, Sabol and myself at the Hyatt Hotel. Later I went to San 
Francisco with Disini and Sabol to meet with other Westinghouse 
officials at the Airport Hilton. There were approximately five people 
present from Westinghouse. 
The agenda was to answer the question -
 why would Westinghouse appoint Mr. Disini. At first, Westinghouse 
seemed skeptical about Disini's abilities but I assured them that once 
Disini accepted appointment as SSR it meant that Westinghouse had 
already received the nuclear project. I explained Mr. Disini's close 
relationship with the President. I also mentioned the fact that Burns 
& Roe had been appointed consultant to NPC. This was very important 
to Westinghouse because it demonstrated Mr. Disini's influence with the 
President. This information satisfied Westinghouse and they agreed to 
retain Disini as SSR.
 


5. 
Prior to mv trip to San Francisco, Mr. Saunders introduced 
me to representatives of Burns & Roe, Inc., an Am:erican engineering
 firm interested in a consulting arrangement with NPC. I arranged a 
meeting between Mr. Disini and Mr. Ketterer of Burns & Roe. The 
meeting was for Mr. Ketterer to understand how Mr. Disini might help 
Burns & Roe secure the consultancv contract. Later I arranged a 
meeting between Mr. Hull of Burns & Roe and Mr. Disini. During this 
meetitig Mr. Disini agreed to assist Burns & Roe and Burns & Roe
 agreed to pay commissions to Disini in exchange for his influence with 
President Marcos
.


 6. Westinghouse agreed to the basic terms of the SSR arrangement in San Francisco. 
Later,
 Westinghouse entered into a written SSR agreement with Disini and 
agreed to pay him substantial "commissions" if he succeeded in obtaining
 the nuclear plant contract for Westinghouse
. It was my 
perception that Westinghouse did not want to spend the money and time 
necessary to prepare a detailed proposal without some tangible evidence 
they would get the job. Mr. Sabol prepared and submitted draft letter of
 intent to be issued by NPC, a copy of which is attached hereto as 
Exhibit A.


7. 
The SSR agreement with Westinghouse listed as many services 
as possible to attempt to justify the size of the fee involved, even 
though a number of the services were not to be performed. When 
Westinghouse encountered any difficulties with NPC during the contact 
negotiations, we could call upon Disini to visit the President and 
arrange to have the President intervene on behalf of Westinghouse.

 One such Westinghouse request to Disini is attached hereto as Exhibit 
B. Another such request is in the form of a Westinghouse "Aide Memoire" 
(attached as Exhibit C), which is the format we often used to 
communicate through Disini with the President. The Aide Memoire bears 
the President's directives to NPC in accordance with the views expressed
 by Westinghouse.

Supplemental Affidavit of Vergara dated December 9, 1988
:
[91]


8. 
Although we reached a general agreement on the 
SSR terms, the implementing details remained to be worked out and were 
not finalized until later. The agreement contained certain general 
terms. It would be effective on March 15, 1974. Disini would receive 
three percent (3%) of the total contract price (firm plus 
reimbursables). Payments would not be due until the prime contract for 
the plant had been signed and Westinghouse had started to draw funds 
against it.


9. It was clearly understood and agreed by Disini and Westinghouse that 
the
 main service to be provided by Disini was to influence President Marcos
 to award the contract to Westinghouse. In fact, during the entire term 
of the SSR contract (which extended for over ten years), Disini rendered
 no substantial services of any kind to Westinghouse, beyond securing 
the prime contract itself
.


10. Another aspect of the deal that Disini and I 
discussed with
 Westinghouse in Manila was the necessity for a commitment to engage 
Burns & Roe to become the architect-engineer for the project. Disini
 had a parallel SSR agreement with Burns & Roe under which he would 
receive commissions from Burns & Roe if that company was selected to
 perform design work during the project's execution
. Therefore, 
he needed to ensure that Burns & Roe received the 
architect/engineering subcontract on the project from Westinghouse. 
Saunders and Sabol had agreed to this aspect of the deal in order to 
preserve the role of Westinghouse as prime contractor. Westinghouse PSPD
 personnel who had to make the decision were opposed to Burns & Roe.
 This issue was only resolved two months later, as further discussed 
below.


 x x x x


15. 
As discussed above, the deal with Burns & Roe would 
result in commission payments to Disini. Therefore, it was in 
everybody's interest that Westinghouse honor Sabol's and Saunders' 
recommendation and engage Burns & Roe. In late April 1974, Mr. 
Kenneth Roe came to the Philippines to sign Burns & Roe's Phase I 
consulting contract with NPC
 and, while in Manila, met with 
Disini and confirmed the SSR agreement that Mr. Hull had negotiated ith 
Disini. We now needed to have a deal between Westinghouse and Burns 
& Roe finalized so that all parties would be bound to each other.


x x x x


 20. The following day, President Marcos met with the Westinghouse 
delegation (Wallace, Keogh, Sabol, myself and others (for a formal 
presentation). Wallace led the presentation. 
The President 
jokingly commented that "you people know how to choose your 
representative" - referring to H. Disini. There is no doubt in my mind 
that Westinghouse executives understood that their SSR payments were 
providing the. inducement to President Marcos to award the contract to 
Westinghouse
.

Affidavit of Jacob dated October 31, 1990:
[93]


11. 
I was aware that Herdis was acting as the 
Special Sales Representative ("SSR") for Westinghouse and Burns & 
Roe in [not readable]. Westinghouse had a written agreement with Herdis 
providing that Herdis would receive commissions in the amount of 3% of 
the Westhighouse contract price. Burns & Roe had a written agreement
 with Technosphere Consultants Group, Inc. ("Technosphere"), a Herdis 
company, pursuant to which Technosphere would receive about 10% of the 
Burns & Roe contract price as commissions. During the course of the 
BNPP project, I was responsible for invoicing and arranging payments 
from Westinghouse and Burns & Roe under these agreements
. See Exhibit

2. Aside from Mr. Disini's efforts in obtaining the award of the 
project to Westinghouse and Burns & Roe, I am not aware of any other
 material services rendered by Herdis or Technosphere under their 
respective agreements.
[94]
 (Emphases supplied)


Vergara's and Jacob's affidavits satisfactorily' proved the due 
execution of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts and their 
corresponding commission agreements with Disini. Vergara narrated in 
detail how Disini was appointed as Westinghouse's SSR and how he exerted
 influence on President Marcos to appoint it as the BNPP project main 
contractor. Also, Vergara clearly testified on how he arranged a meeting
 between Disini and B&R for the former to also become the latter's 
SSR to President Marcos with respect to the BNPP project.


These transactions with Westinghouse and B&R were corroborated by
 Jacob in his affidavit. As deduced from Vergara's and Jacob's 
affidavits, the BNPP project was successfully awarded to Westinghouse as
 the main contractor and to B&R as the architect-engineer because of
 Disini's influence and close association with President Marcos. 
Certainly, the existence of the Westinghouse and B&Rs contracts had 
been duly proved.


As to Disini's commission agreements with Westinghouse and B&R, 
Vergara and Jacob positively affirmed the existence thereof as they had 
the opportunity to personally witness and participate in these 
transactions. Vergara was the President of AII, which acted as the SSR 
of Westinghouse in the Philippines. He was present at the start of the 
negotiation between Westinghouse and Disini until the award of the BNPP 
project to Westinghouse.


Certainly, his testimony as to the existence of Disini's commission 
agreement with Westinghouse is credible and highly probable under the 
circumstances. In addition, Vergara was also present during the 
negotiation between Disini and B&R as he, himself, brokered and 
arranged the meeting between Westinghouse and B&R for the former to 
engage the services of the latter as architect-engineer, pursuant to 
Disini's agreement with B&R.


Jacob corroborated Vergara's declarations when he, as the President 
of Herdis, confirmed the existence of these commission agreements. He 
specifically testified that: (a) Herdis and Westinghouse had a written 
agreement wherein the former would receive 3% of the latter's total 
contract price in the BNPP project; and (b) TCP, a subsidiary of Herdis,
 and B&R also had a written agreement wherein the former would 
receive 10% of the total contract price of the latter in the BNPP 
project.


These testimonies sufficiently prove the existence of the 
Westinghouse and B&R contracts and their corresponding commission 
agreements. Contrary to Disini's contention, the Best Evidence Rule is 
not applicable in the present case. The Republic presented the 
affidavits of both Vergara and Jacob to prove the existence and 
execution of these contracts and the corresponding commission agreements
 without inference as to the contents or terms thereof. Hence, We rule 
in favor of the Republic.


However, for Disini to be held liable to return and account for the 
commissions he allegedly received, the Republic must prove by 
preponderance of evidence not only the existence of these contracts and 
commission agreements but the receipt of these substantial commissions 
by Disini from Westinghouse and B&R as well.           
Disini received commissions from Westinghouse and B&R:
 
 
 The evidence on record shows that Disini received commissions from 
Westinghouse and B&R despite the non-presentation by the Republic of
 the Westinghouse and B&R contracts and their respective commission 
agreements. The sworn testimonies and affidavits of Vergara and Jacob 
are categorical, credible and corroborative, sufficiently proving that 
Disini, through Herdis and its subsidiaries, acquired ill-gotten wealth 
in relation to the BNPP project.


Vergara's Affidavits:


 Vergara testified as to his participation in the negotiation and 
execution of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts and Disini's 
commission agreements. He declared that Disini received millions of 
dollars in commissions from Westinghouse and B&R relative to the 
BNPP project as well as additional compensation through contracts 
entered into by Herdis and its subsidiaries, to wit: 


8. 
Disini received "commission" payments 
from Westinghouse and Burns & Roe amounting to many millions of 
dollars. He received additional compensation through contracts and 
subcontracts awarded to companies he owned to provide goods or services 
for the nuclear project. I formed Power Contractors, Inc., for example, 
to perform the civil/structural construction work for the project. Asia 
Industries owned 40% of PCI at the outset. This 40% was acquired almost 
immediately by Mr. Disini. Mr. Jacob acquired [FOR HERDIS] an existing 
insurance company, and renamed it Summa Insurance, Inc., to provide the 
insurance coverage for the project
. By virtue of his 
relationship with President Marcos and his agreements with Westinghouse 
and Burns & Roe, Disini could obtain virtually any lucrative 
contract or subcontract for the nuclear project that he wished.
[95]
 (Emphases supplied)


Vergara testified as to Disini's participation in the BNPP project by
 facilitating the award of the BNPP project to Westinghouse and B&R 
and through acquisition of companies involved in the BNPP project. 
Vergara participated in the incorporation of PCI, a consortium which 
performed civil or constructional work for te BNPP project. Thereafter, 
PCI, which was 40% owned by AII, was subsequently acquired by Disini. 
He also declared that Herdis acquired an insurance company and renamed 
it as Summa Insurance, Inc. (SII) which provided insurance coverage for 
the BNPP project. Vergara claimed that these companies, PCI and SII, 
gave lucrative compensation to Disini in view of his involvement in the 
BNPP project.


 He also confirmed that Disini received these substantial commissions through Herdis and AII, thus: 


28. 
Pursuant to the respective SSR agreements 
Westinghouse entered into with Asia Industries and Herdis, commissions 
were paid to Asia Industries and Herdis
. Exhibit 4 is a July 14,
 1975 revision of the SSR Agreement between Asia Industries and 
Westinghouse, which I signed for Asia Industries.


29.
 
Many of the commission payments ostensibly made to Asia Industries were actually credited but never received by Asia Industries
.
 Rodolfo Jacob and Jerry Orlina, who were Disini's righthand financial 
advisors, would know the disposition, transfer and distribution of the 
commission payments and the actual amount involved.
[96]
 (Emphases supplied)


In his Supplemental Affidavit dated January 5, 1989,
[97]

 Vergara further elucidated on what happened to AII's commissions due 
from Westinghouse which were not received by or transferred to the 
company, 
viz
.:


7. The Westinghouse-NPC contract was signed in February 1976 and 
Westinghouse was released to start work a few months later, whereupon 
the SSR commissions began to accrue. 
Even though commissions were 
paid Herdis by Westinghouse as they became due, Asia Industries did not 
receive any commission payments and was not even notified that the first
 two payments had been made until much later, when I asked Westinghouse 
for an accounting
.


x x x x


11. I was head of Asia Industries from 1975 until its acquisition by 
the National Development Company in April 1982. During this period, I 
served as Asia Industries' President and also as a member of its Board 
of Directors. I managed the company in all respects except the financial
 one, for HGI controlled our treasury and finances.


12. 
Westinghouse's SSR agreement with Asia Industries (Exhibit 4
 to the Supplemental Affidavit) committed Westinghouse to paying Asia 
Industries over $6 million in commissions
. We used that 
commitment in July 1977, when Asia Industries sought to acquire Usiphil, Inc. ("Usiphil"), a former sister company. We applied for a $25 
million standby letter of credit from the Philippine National Bank 
("PNB"), a Philippine Government-owned bank, to finance the acquisition.
 Our application was supported by Usiphil's business prospects, and was 
backed in part by our anticipated; receipt of nuclear power plant 
commissions from Westinghouse. We did succeed in acquiring Usiphil, but 
it apparently took President Marcos' personal involvement to overcome 
the opposition of PNB to the transactions.


 x x x x


14. It was my understanding and expectation that Asia Industries 
would receive and avail itself of the Westinghouse commissions. 
Starting
 in 1978, as a result of the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation 
of illegal payments in connection with the nuclear power plant project, 
Westinghouse stopped sending commission payments to Switzerland and 
began to remit the payments directly to the Philippines. After this 
switch, Asia Industries commissions still ended up in the hands of HGI
.
 In most cases, the transfers of funds were reflected in the company's 
books as "shortÂ­-term investments" or "other current assets." Exhibit 4 
is a copy of Asia Industries' financial statements for the years 1979 
and 1980. As Exhibit 4 shows, by the end of 1980 Asia Industries had 
booked 47.3 million pesos in "short term investments" and 1.5 million 
pesos as "other assets." The transfer of Westinghouse commissions to HGI
 accounts for the vast majority of the amounts covered by those entries.


15. 
In some cases, the commission pavments were transferred 
directly to HGI without even entering them in Asia Industries' books. 
For example, in January 1979 Westinghouse forwarded to Asia Industries a
 commission payment of $579,619.27, and gave notice of this transfer by a
 January 30, 1979 telex from its Export Treasury Department to our 
General Manager V.B. Mimbras (Exhibit 5 hereto is a copy of that telex).
 Upon receipt of the funds, Mr. Jacob requested that we turn the 
$579,000 commission over to him immediately, and this was done
. 
Exhibit 6 memorializes the transaction; it is a May 8, 1980 memorandum 
to me from Asia Industries' treasurer, Mr. Gutierrez, indicating the 
disposition given to the check. Mr. Jacob never reimbursed Asia 
Industries for this check.
[98]
(Emphases supplied)


In addition to the existence of Westinghouse's commission agreement 
with Herdis, Vergara also confirmed the existence of Westinghouse's 
agreement with AII Vergara declared that AII and Westinghouse had an SSR
 agreement wherein the former would receive commissions from the latter 
in exchange for its service as SSR. However, Vergara deposed that no 
commissions were ever received by the company from Westinghouse as these
 commissions were directly paid or transferred to Herdis, AII's owner.
[99]

 This clearly demonstrated how Disini utilized companies such as AII and
 Herdis in his scheme of amassing ill-gotten wealth. He merely procured 
AII to facilitate his receipt of the commissions thereby unjustly 
enriching himself to the detriment of the Republic. This fact was 
confirmed by Vergara when Disini purchased AII because of its SSR 
agreement with. Westinghouse and the certainty that the BNPP project 
would be awarded to Westinghouse, to wit:


5.
 
Aware of the large amounts in commissions 
that Westinghouse would pay Asia Industries once the nuclear power plant
 project was initiated, Mr. Disini offered to buy Asia Industries from 
its corporate parent, and was able to purchase it for approximately $2.5
 million. This deal was indicative of Mr. Disini's complete confidence 
that he would be able to secure a contract for the nuclear power plant
.
 This confidence was further evidenced by the fact that Mr. Disini had 
to borrow from a Swiss bank the purchase price of Asia Industries, and 
offered the upcoming commissions on the nuclear power plant as proof of 
his ability to pay back the loan. Mr. Disini, his chief assistant 
Rodolfo Jacob, and I travelled to Basel, Switzerland to arrange for the 
bank loan and close on the sale with U.S. Industries, Inc.
[100]
 (Emphasis supplied.)


The existence and due execution of these contracts and commission 
agreements, the successful award of the BNPP project to Westinghouse and
 B&R and the construction of the still inoperable BNPP strengthened 
the fact that commissions due to Disini already accrued, and were 
credited and received by the latter. Disini would not have bought AII if
 he was not confident that Westinghouse would be awarded the BNPP 
project. Thus, when the Westinghouse contract was signed and thereafter 
implemented, the commissions due Disini also accrued. Vergara's 
affidavits affirmed Disini's receipt of commissions, thus: 


Supplemental Affidavit of Vergara dated December 9, 1988:


8. Although we reached a general agreement on the SSR 
terms, the implementing details remained to be worked out and were not 
finalized until later. The agreement contained certain general terms. It
 would be effective on March 15, 1974. Disini would receive three 
percent (3%) of the total contract price (firm plus reimbursables). 
Payments
 would not be due until the prime contract for the plant had been signed
 and Westinghouse had started to draw funds against it.


9. It was clearly understood and agreed by Disini and Westinghouse 
that the main service to be provided by Disini was to influence 
President Marcos to award the contract to Westinghouse. 
In fact, 
during the entire term of the SSR contract (which extended for over ten 
years), Disini rendered no substantial services of any kind to 
Westinghouse, beyond securing the prime contract itself
.
[101]
 (Emphasis supplied)


Affidavit of Vergara dated January 25, 1989:


7. 
The Westinghouse-NPC contract was signed in
 February 1976 and Westinghouse was released to start work for a few 
months later, whereupon the SSR commissions began to accrue
.
 Even though commissions were paid Herdis by Westinghouse as they become
 due, Asia Industries did not receive any commission payments and was 
not even notified that the first two payments had been made until much 
later, when I asked Westinghouse for an accounting.
[102]
 (Emphasis supplied)


Although Vergara testified that he had no personal knowledge as to 
the transfer of these commissions to Disini, his testimonies and sworn
 affidavits are relevant in laying the foundation of Disini's receipt 
thereof by categorically declaring the existence of these Westinghouse 
and B&R contracts and their respective commission agreements and the
 time of accrual of these commissions. Also, Vergara demonstrated the 
extent of Disini's participation in the BNPP project through his company
 Herdis and its subsidiaries, and his further acquisition of other 
companies involved in the project. This reveals Disini's considerable 
interest in a government project which he obviously attained due to his 
influence and close association with President Marcos. 


Jacob's Affidavits:


 For his part, Jacob was equally candid in his testimony and sworn 
affidavits which firmly established Disini's receipt of these 
commissions. Based on his personal knowledge as President of Herdis, he 
declared that he participated in the transfer of these commissions from 
Westinghouse and B&R to Disini's accounts, to wit:


Affidavit dated October 31, 1990: 


11. I was aware that Herdis was acting as the Special 
Sales Representative ("SSR") for Westinghouse and Burns & Roe in 
[not readable]. Westinghouse had a written agreement with Herdis 
providing that Herdis would receive commissions in the amount of 3% of 
the Westinghouse contract price. Burns & Roe had a written agreement
 with Technosphere Consultants Group, Inc. ("Technosphere"), Herdis 
company, pursuant to which Technosphere would receive about 10% of the 
Burns & Roe contract price as commissions. 
During the course 
of the PNPP project, I was responsible for invoicing and arranging 
payments from Westinghouse and Burns & Roe under these agreements
.
 See Exhibit 2. Aside from Mr. Disini's efforts in obtaining the award 
of the project to Westinghouse and Burns & Roe, I am not aware of 
any other material services rendered by Herdis or Technosphere under 
their respective agreements.


 x x x x


13. 
I was aware that Westinghouse and Burns & Roe made 
commission payments beginning 1976. Upon Mr. Disini's instructions, the 
commission payments were not recorded on the books of Herdis and 
Technosphere. Upon Mr. Disini's further instructions, I directed 
Westinghouse and Burns & Roe to remit the commissions directly to 
Mr. Rene Pasche in Switzerland who deposited them in Swiss banks. This 
was the arrangement until the U.S. Department of Justice Investigation 
in 1978, when Westinghouse advised us that henceforth payments would be 
remitted straight to Manila
. On the basis of my dealings with 
Westinghouse officials and my examination of their internal memos and 
other documentary evidence, I believe that Westinghouse knew that 
President Marcos was getting financial benefits from the contract.


 14. 
To receive the Westinghouse commission payments in the 
Philippines, Foreign currency Deposit Unit accounts were opened at 
International Corporate Bank ("Interbank"). Mr. Disini and I were 
the signatories for the accounts. A substantial portion of the funds in 
this Interbank account were remitted to overseas accounts in Switzerland
 and elsewhere.
 Exhibit 3 is an example of a remittance that I 
ordered transferring commission payments from Interbank to the Swiss 
Volks Bank for the account 20529 Santa Clara.
[103]
 (Emphases supplied)


Supplemental Affidavit dated June 16, 1994




1. 
Moreover, Mr. Disini had opened bank accounts in Switzerland
 under the account names "965 Summa" and "735 Phil", where Pacencia 
Disini and I were authorized signatories
.
 I surmise that I
 was made a signatory to these accounts because Mr. Disini trusted me to
 give Mrs. Disini the necessary assistance in any transactions regarding
 the funds deposited in such accounts although I do not recall having 
personally made withdrawals from such accounts. I confirm the 
authenticity from such accounts. I confirm the authenticity of my 
signatures in the aforementioned accounts as evidenced by the Swiss bank
 documents attached hereto as Annexes "A", "B", "C", "D", "E" and "F". 


x x x x


8. 
Anent the commission payments made by Westinghouse in 
connection with the contract for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear 
Power Plant, since Mr. Disini owns HERDIS, he personally received the 
commissions due HERDIS and such payments were kept off the books of 
HERDIS. However, while as I stated in my previous affidavit, I had a 
role in transmitting some of these commissions, upon Mr. Disini's 
instructions, to his bank accounts in Switzerland and Singapore
.
 I was not involved in the international operations of Mr. Disini's 
personal businesses abroad. Mr. Disini hired foreign officers and 
personnel to manage his businesses abroad. One of this trusted men, a 
finance man by the name of Rene Pasche, was in charge of his Swiss bank 
accounts and in fact, the name of one of Mr. Disini's company, PADIS SA,
 stands for Pasche and Disini. 
[104]
 (Emphases supplied)


A review of Jacob's affidavits, identified and duly authenticated by 
him, reveals that as President of Herdis, he had personal knowledge of 
Herdis' transactions, especially with respect to the BNPP project as 
well as other circumstances surrounding it. For a testimonial evidence 
to be believed, it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible 
witness but must also be credible in itself such that common experience 
and observation of mankind lead to the inference of its probability 
under the circumstances.
[105]


Jacob's credibility to testify on the matter of Disini's receipt of 
commissions stemmed from Disini's trust and confidence in him as he 
was personally invited by Disini to work for his company Herdis, to wit:


Affidavit dated October 31, 1990:


4. 
Sometime in mid-1974, Mr. Disini visited 
me at my office and first broached the idea of my joining Herdis as 
President. In subsequent talks, he persistently tried to convince me to 
do so
. He explained the expansion plans of Herdis and that he' 
needed me to set up and run a professional organization to implement 
these plans. He assured me that as Herdis President I would have a free 
hand in major decisions and policies. He also offered to guarantee me a 
compensation package at least equivalent to what I was receiving at SGV.
 These discussions went on for several months.

5. 
After some serious thought, I accepted Mr. Disini's 
offer sometime in late 1974. About March, 1975, Mr. Disini began 
introducing me to the officers and staff of Herdis and its subsidiaries
. Occasionally, I was given informal briefings on Herdis' business corporations. 
I
 likewise was invited by Mr. Disini to be present in two or three 
meetings with Westinghouse officers, wherein I was introduced. I recall 
that in one meeting with Westinghouse officers in April, 1975, the 
matter of commissions and contract price were discussed
 (as reflected in Mr. Sabol's April 15, 1975 letter to me. See Exhibit 1.)
[106]
 (Emphases supplied)


Undoubtedly, Disini trusted Jacob as he hired him as President of 
Herdis and even allowed him to join in his meetings with Westinghouse. 
Disini also entrusted to Jacob the task of transferring his commissions 
from Westinghouse and B&R to his overseas personal bank accounts. In
 fact, Jacob declared that he was even made a signatory to some of these
 overseas bank accounts, as well as in a Philippine foreign currency 
deposit unit account.


Despite the fact that the Republic offered mere photocopies of the 
bank documents, this does not affect the admissibility and probative 
value of Jacob's sworn statement as to the existence of the bank accounts 
and Disini's receipt of commissions, 'especially since these statements 
came from a credible witness such as Jacob. To stress, when the evidence
 presented concerns the existence, execution or delivery of the writing,
 without inference to its terms, the Best Evidence Rule cannot be 
invoked. Clearly, Jacob is credible to testify on matters regarding 
Disini's receipt of commissions from Westinghouse and B&R and the 
manner of his participation as well as that of Herdis and its 
subsidiaries. Hence, his testimony and sworn affidavits must be accorded 
probative value.


Moreover, Jacob corroborated Vergara's testimony that Herdis and its 
subsidiary TCI received. commissions from Westinghouse and B&R, 
respectively, even when these companies did not render any service in 
relation to the BNPP project. As part of his affidavit, the Republic 
attached certain transmittal letters, invoice and bank documents the 
contents of which may not be admissible in evidence as they are mere 
photocopies and not properly authenticated. However, these may be 
considered part of Jacob's testimony as he, himself, was the recipient 
and/or author no less of these transmittal letters and invoice, and the 
signatory to the bank documents.


 Also, Jacob explained that Herdis received the commissions from 
Westinghouse but they were not recorded in its books and were instead 
remitted directly to Disini's overseas bank accounts and later to a 
Philippine fiduciary deposit unit account which were then transferred by
 Jacob himself to Disini's overseas bank accounts. As part of Jacob's 
testimony, the Republic offered a sample remittance made by Jacob to 
Disipi's overseas bank account. Again, the document and the contents 
thereof are not 
per se
 considered as admissible under the Rules, 
but is only part of the narration of the witness that he effected the 
transfer of these commissions to Disini.


We are cognizant of the fact that the Republic presented "certified 
xerox copies" of most, if not all, of its documentary evidence. In the 
assailed Decision, the 
Sandiganbayan
 gave no probative value to 
these documents tending to prove Disini's overseas bank accounts as they 
were not properly authenticated or translated, to wit: 


We, however, cannot give probative weight to the 
documents relating to the existence of the so-called Disini Swiss 
accounts considering that these documents are foreign private documents 
in the German and French language. x x x


x x x x


The evidence consisting of Exhibits "HHH," "HHH-TR," "III," "III-TR," 
"JJJ" and sub-markings, "JJJ-TR," "KKK" and sub-markings, "KKK-TR," "LLL" 
and sub-markings, "LLL-TR," "MMM," "MMM-TR," "NNN," "NNN-TR," "NNN-1,"

respective translations, "SSS" and sub-markings and their respective 
translations, "TTT," "TTT(TR)," "UUU," "UUU(TR)," "VVV," and "VVV(TR)" 
presented by the plaintiff were unauthenticated and not properly 
translated. 
All the documents relating to these accounts were 
photocopies. As stated in the Rules of Court, for a private document to 
be proven, due execution and authenticity must be proven. This was not 
fulfilled by the plaintiff as what was presented were mere photocopies 
of supposed bank statements/records received by the Philippine Embassy 
in Switzerland and those which a PCGG employee had received here in the 
Philippines
. No evidence established why the originals of the 
documents could not be produced. At the very least, the plaintiff should
 have presented the records as received by the Philippine Embassy. 
Furthermore, the documentary evidence given were also photocopies of the translations, which ere done here in the Philippines
.
 There was no explanation as to why this was done. Thus, the translation
 of French and German texts into English is unacceptable. There was no 
opportunity for the Court to scrutinize the translations as the supposed
 translator was not even presented.


Additionally, majority of the other documentary evidence offered by 
the plaintiff are mere photocopies. Some were even photocopies of 
photocopies, and bad copies at that. x x x
[107]
 (Emphasis supplied)


Nonetheless, the absence of these documents is not fatal to the 
Republic's cause especially since the testimonial evidence offered 
contained positive declarations of witnesses based on their personal 
knowledge. We thus hold that the Republic has duly proved by 
preponderance of evidence through the affidavits of Vergara and Jacob, 
the fact of receipt by Disini of these commissions from Westinghouse and
 B&R. 


Preponderance of Evidence:
 


In cases involving ill-gotten wealth, EO No. 14-A clearly requires preponderance of evidence.
[108]

 Section 1, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides for the quantum of 
evidence for civil actions, and delineates how preponderance of evidence
 is determined, 
viz
.: 


Section 1. 
Preponderance of evidence, how determined.
 -
 In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his
 case by a preponderance of evidence. In determining where the 
preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the issues involved 
lies,
 the court may consider all the facts and circumstances 
of the case, the witnesses' manner of testifying. their intelligence, 
their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are 
testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the 
probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want 
of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may 
legitimately appear upon the trial.
 The court may also consider the number of witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greater number.
[109]
 (Emphasis supplied)


Preponderance of evidence means that the evidence adduced by one side is, as a whole, superior to that of the other side.
[110]
 Essentially, preponderance of evidence refers to the comparative weight of the evidence presented by the opposing parties.
[111]

 As such, it has been defined as "the weight, credit, and value of the 
aggregate evidence on either side," and is usually considered to be 
synonymous with the term greater weight of the evidence or greater 
weight of the credible evidence.
[112]
 It is proof that is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto.
[113]
 


In this case, Disini was declared in default and failed to adduce 
evidence in his behalf. However, the Republic must still abide by the 
principles of due process which require that there be preponderant 
evidence of Disini's acquisition of ill-gotten wealth. Hence, the 
Republic carries the heavy burden of proof and must discharge such 
burden satisfactorily; otherwise, the action would fail.




Applying said principle, the factual circumstances established by the
 Republic through testimonial evidence are sufficient and convincing 
enough to prove that Disini received substantial commissions from 
Westinghouse and B&R in relation to the BNPP project despite lack of
 documentary proof of his receipt thereof. It bears noting that these 
commissions were ill-gotten wealth acquired by Disini through illegal or
 clever means to disguise and hide the illicit nature of its 
acquisition.


Hence, original copies of documentary evidence showing actual receipt
 by Disini of these commissions would surely be arduous, if not 
impossible, to retrieve. In fact, Jacob affirmed that these commissions 
were not even recorded in Herdis' company books which means that Disini 
intended to conceal receipt of these commissions to avoid any trace of 
his illegal involvement with the BNPP project by leaving no proof of 
receipt thereof by Herdis.


 The narrations of Vergara and Jacob which duly established the 
existence of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts and their 
corresponding commission agreements, and the transfer of these 
commissions to Disini's overseas bank accounts, convince this Court that
 Disini indeed received substantial commissions constituting ill-gotten 
wealth. In addition, the testimonies and sworn affidavits of Vergara and
 Jacob, as President of All and Herdis, respectively, deserve greater 
consideration since they had the opportunity to personally witness these
 factual circumstances because of their respective positions in the 
companies owned by Disini.


Also, the corroborative testimonies of Vergara and Jacob are worthy 
of belief as they are neither improbable nor impossible. Both Vergara 
and Jacob have no reason to lie and would gain no benefit from doing so.
 As witnesses who have sworn under oath, they may be held liable for 
perjury for giving false statements or failing to comply with the order 
to testify or provide information.
[114]
 


Further, their act of testifying for the Republic is specifically 
enjoined by Executive Order No. 2 which requires all persons holding 
assets or properties in their names as nominees, agents or trustees, to 
make full disclosure of the same to the Republic. Indeed, Jacob's own 
admission that he was made a signatory to Disini's overseas bank 
accounts and Philippine fiduciary deposit unit account is a duty 
required under the law. Consequently, Vergara and Jacob were obliged to 
fully disclose these illegal contracts and their participation thereto. 
Hence, there is no reason to doubt their testimonies and sworn 
affidavits. They are straightforward, candid, and in some respect, 
supported by their own admissions against interest.


 Contrary to Disini's contention, the lack of a definite amount in 
Vergara's and Jacob's testimonies, except the statement that Disini 
received 3% and 10% of Westinghouse's and B&R's total contract 
price, respectively, does not refute or negate the operative fact of 
Disini's acquisition of ill-gotten wealth through concealment of his 
commissions behind the facade of Herdis and its subsidiaries. In fine, 
We find that the Republic has duly proved by preponderance of evidence 
that Disini acquired ill-gotten wealth in the form of commissions from 
Westinghouse and B&R by acting as their SSR for the BNPP project.


In ruling for the Republic, the 
Sandiganbayan
 relied on 
Yuchengco v. Sandiganbayan (Yuchengco)
[115]

 when it held that the affidavits of Manahan, Vergara and Jacob are 
sufficient to hold Disini liable to reconvey ill-gotten wealth, 
i.e.
 U$50,562,500.00, even without documentary proof. In the assailed Decision, the Sandiganbayan stated: 


As in Yuchengco, this Court chooses to place its
 belief on the testimonies of Jacob, Vergara and Manahan because of 
their credibility and the inherent corroborative nature of their 
testimonies
.
 There is not a
 shred of evidence to controvert their statements, not only because 
defendants were declared in default, but also because there is no reason
 to doubt their credibility. These witnesses occupied very special loci 
of trust and confidence within the Disini circle, and also observed from
 a privileged point of view the dealings with Marcos, and vice versa. 
Their affidavits were sworn to and also affirmed through their 
testimonies before the Court. There is no doubt in Our mind that their 
statements should be given utmost weight
. The testimonial 
evidence presented by the plaintiff remained unrebutted and 
uncontradicted and therefore, amounts to preponderant evidence. 
[116]
 (Emphasis supplied)


In 
Yuchengco
, this Court gave credence to the testimonial 
evidence offered by the Republic even if almost all documents it offered
 were mere photocopies. The issue in Yuchengco centered on the recovery 
of the Marcoses' shares of stock in the Philippine Telecommunications 
Investment Corporation (PTIC): 76,779 shares in the name of Ramon U. 
Cojuangco, 21,525 shares in the name of Imelda O. Cojuangco, and 111,415
 shares in the name of Prime Holdings Incorporated (PHI).
[117]


Consequently, as to the true owner of PHI, Witness Jose Yao Campos' 
(Campos) testimony was categorical when he declared that in all of the 
corporations he organized, the certificates indorsed in blank or deed of
 trust or assignment in favor of an unnamed beneficiary were delivered 
to President Marcos. Even without presenting these deeds of trust or 
assignment, his testimony proved the existence and the delivery thereof 
to President Marcos. His testimony, therefore, supported the Republic's 
contention that PHI was a dummy corporation for President Marcos.
[118]
 


Here, the Republic offered the affidavits of Vergara and Jacob to 
prove that Disini received substantial commissions from Westinghouse and
 B&R. Similarly, their testimonies proved the existence of the 
Westinghouse and B&R contracts and their respective commission agreements and Disini 's receipt of these substantial commissions.


Moreover, in 
Yuchengco
, Campos' testimony was corroborated by 
witness Rolando Gapud who testified that he did not own the 400 shares 
of stock in Pill but only held it in trust for President Marcos. He also
 affirmed, based on his personal knowledge, that the certificates 
indorsed in blank deed of trust or assignment were delivered to 
President Marcos. Another witness, Francisco de Guzman, confirmed that 
Campos organized PHI with his associates and that they held their shares
 as mere nominees. Thus, the issue of who owned PHI was well-supported 
by the testimonies of Campos, Gapud and de Guzman even without the 
purported deeds of assignment.
[119]
 


In the present case, Vergara's sworn affidavits corroborated that of 
Jacob. Vergara testified as to the negotiation of, contracts by Disini 
with Westinghouse and B&R as well as the existence of these 
contracts and commission agreements. These facts were confirmed by Jacob
 when he categorically admitted his participation in the transfer of 
these commissions to Disini's overseas bank accounts as per the existing
 commission agreements of Herdis and TCI with Westinghouse and B&R, 
respectively. Both witnesses also declared that Herdis and TCI did not 
render any service for the BNPP project that would justify the payment 
of these commissions. Clearly, the commissions were paid for the service
 of Disini as Westinghouse and B&R's SSR to President Marcos.


However, unlike in 
Yuchengco
 where the specific shares of 
Marcos' dummy corporations were identified and undisputed, here the 
amount of commissions received by Disini is being contested. The 
Republic's witnesses did not specifically quantify the amount of 
commissions but referred to certain documents which were not only mere 
photocopies but were also not properly authenticated. Hence, these 
documents are inadmissible and have no probative value.


Also, Vergara and Jacob's testimony that Disini was paid 3% and 10% 
of the Westinghouse and B&R contracts as commissions clearly 
warrants the review of the terms of the contract which is covered by the
 Best Evidence Rule. Hence, We cannot give credit to these declarations 
without violating a basic evidentiary rule.


 While it is true that 
Yuchengco
 was not intended as a 
precedent with respect to giving weight and credence to testimonial 
evidence despite lack of documentary proof in future cases involving 
actions for recovery of ill-gotten wealth, Yuchengco did not state nor 
in any way imply, that testimonial evidence is superior over documentary
 evidence and sufficient to establish proof of ill-gotten wealth.


What the ruling in 
Yuchengco
 teaches is that testimonial 
evidence when credible, categorical and corroborated is given credence 
and weight to prove acquisition of ill-gotten wealth. This is not a 
justification, however, for any party to merely submit photocopies of 
documents without properly authenticating the same in violation of 
evidentiary rules and confidently expect its claims to be granted based 
on testimonial evidence, especially when the contents of a documentary 
evidence are put in issue and necessary for adjudication on the merits.


Nonetheless, We ruled in 
Republic v. Spouses Gimenez
[120]

 that the court may consider testimonial evidence and exhibits offered 
as part of the witnesses' testimonies in an action for acquisition of 
ill-gotten wealth, thus: 




Notably, the Sandiganbayan's evaluation of the evidence presented by

petitioner was cursory. main reason for granting the Motion to Dismiss 
on Demurrer to Evidence was that there was no evidence to consider due 
to petitioner's failure to file its Formal Offer of Evidence. It brushed
 off the totality of evidence on which petitioner built its case.


Even assuming that no documentary evidence was properly 
offered, this court finds it clear from the second assailed Resolution 
that the 
Sandiganbayan
 did not even consider other evidence presented by petitioner during the 19 years of trial. The 
Sandiganbavan

 erred in ignoring petitioner's testimonial evidence without any basis 
or justification. Numerous exhibits were offered as part of the 
testimonies of petitioner's witnesses
.


Petitioner presented both testimonial and documentary evidence that 
tended to establish a presumption that respondents acquired ill-Â­gotten 
wealth during respondent Fe Roa Gimenez's incumbency as public officer 
and which total amount or value was manifestly out of proportion to her 
and her husband's salaries and to their other lawful income or 
properties.
[121]
 (Emphasis supplied)


While We recognize that the defendant's right to due process of law 
must always be protected and upheld, We also acknowledge the Republic's 
tedious job, through the PCGG, in gathering evidence of ill-gotten 
wealth which is mostly cleverly concealed and not easily apparent and 
accessible given the nature of its illegality. We cannot just ignore the
 credible, candid and corroborated testimonial evidence on the pretext 
of lack of documentary evidence. Neither should We place superiority on 
the documentary evidence over the sworn testimonies of witnesses and 
vice versa
.
 All admissible evidence should be weighed, considered and scrutinized 
by the court for and/or against parties to arrive at a judgment taking 
into consideration the quantum of evidence required.


Hence, We affirm the 
Sandiganbayan
' s ruling that Disini 
acquired ill-Â­gotten wealth by receiving substantial commissions from 
Westinghouse and B&R in connection with the BNPP project by giving 
credence to Jacob and Vergara's testimonial evidence and the exhibits 
offered as part of their testimonies which are credible, categorical and
 corroborative. However, We cannot subscribe to the 
Sandiganbayan
's conclusion that Disini is liable to reconvey the amount of $50,562,500.00.           
No sufficient proof of the amount of $50,562,500.00:
 
 
 To prove the amount of the total commissions received by Disini, the
 best evidence would be the Westinghouse and B&R contracts and their
 corresponding commission agreements, especially considering the 
Republic's claim that the commissions received by Disini were based on 
3% and 10% of the total contract price of the Westinghouse and B&R 
contracts, respectively, which clearly requires an inquiry into the 
specific terms and contents of the contracts. However, the Republic 
offered no justification as to their non-Â­presentation thereof. As to the
 secondary evidence,
 i.e
. Exhibit E-9 and the affidavits of 
Manahan, Vergara and Jacob, the Republic offered no explanation why they
 should fall under any of the exceptions to the Best Evidence Rule.


The 
Sandiganbayan
 nevertheless accorded great weight to 
Exhibit E-9 or a tabulation of commissions allegedly typewritten on 
Disini's stationery, which was attached to Manahan's affidavit, to 
arrive at the amount of 50,562,500.00. We reproduce Exhibit E-9 below.
[122]


(see image p. 39)


Patently, Exhibit E-9 is a certified xerox copy. The Republic intends
 to prove the total amount of Commissions received by Disini by 
presenting his typewritten tabulation of commissions on his stationery.
 However, under the Best Evidence Rule, when the subject of inquiry is 
the content of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than 
the original document itself subject to certain exceptions. Here; the 
Republic failed to offer any plausible reason or justification why it 
presented a mere photocopy instead of the original.


 Mere attestation by the affiant that he saw the original copies of 
the documents and that the photocopies are faithful reproductions of the
 original will not suffice without the Republic offering proof that the 
presentation of the secondary evidence is within the exceptions 
contemplated under Section 5, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court. Absent such
 justification, the certified xerox copy of Exhibit E-9 attached to 
Manahan's affidavits cannot be given any evidentiary value for the 
purpose for which it was offered, 
i.e
., to establish the amount of commissions received by Disini.


Further, in offering documents as evidence before the court, such are
 classified as either public or private. Rule 132, Section 19 of the 
Rules of Court provides: 


SEC. 19. 
Classes of Documents.
 â For the purpose of their presentation in evidence, documents are either public or private.


Public documents are:


(a) The written official acts, or records of the official acts of the
 sovereign authority, official bodies and tribunals, and public 
officers, whether of the Philippines, or of a foreign country;


(b) Documents acknowledge before a notary public except last wills and testaments; and


(c) Public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein.


All other writings are private.


The importance of classifying documents into public or private is explained in 
Patula v. People
,
[123]
 to wit:


The nature of documents as either public or private 
determines how the documents may be presented as evidence in court. A 
public document, by virtue of its official or sovereign character, or 
because it has been acknowledged before a notary public (except a 
notarial will) or a competent public official with the formalities 
required by law, or because it is a public record of a private writing 
authorized by law, 
is self-authenticating and requires no further authentication in order to be presented as evidence in court
.
 In contrast, a private document is any other writing, deed, or instrument executed by a private person without the intervention of a 
notary or other person legally authorized by which some disposition or 
agreement is proved or set forth. Lacking the official or sovereign 
character of a public document, or the solemnities prescribed by law, a 
private document requires authentication in the manner allowed by law or
 the Rules of Court before its acceptance as evidence in court.
[124]


Whether a document is public or private is relevant in determining 
its admissibility as evidence. Public documents are admissible in 
evidence even without further proof of their due execution and 
genuineness. On the other hand, private documents are inadmissible in 
evidence unless they are properly authenticated.
[125]
 Clearly, Exhibit E-9 is a private document, thus it must be properly authenticated to be admissible and given probative value. 
Admissibility is different from probative value:
 
 
Disini assails both the admissibility and probative value of Exhibit E-9. He claims that the 
Sandiganbayan
 violated the rule on authentication of documents under Section 20 of Rule 132
[126]
 when it 
admitted
 and 
relied
 on Exhibit E-9.
[127]


 "[A]dmissibility of evidence should not be confused with its 
probative value. Admissibility refers to the question of whether certain
 pieces of evidence are to be considered at all, while probative value 
refers to the question of whether the admitted evidence proves an 
issue."
[128]
 "Thus, a 
particular evidence may be admissible, but its evidentiary weight 
depends on judicial evaluation within the guidelines provided by the 
rules of evidence."
[129]


 Evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is not excluded by the law or the rules on evidence.
[130]
 Before any 
private

 document offered as authentic, such as Exhibit E-9, is received in 
evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved by anyone 
who saw the document executed or written, or by evidence of the 
genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.
[131]

 "During authentication in court, a witness positively testifies that a 
document presented as evidence is genuine and has been duly executed or 
that the document is neither spurious nor counterfeit nor executed by 
mistake or under duress."
[132]


Disini argues that sine Exhibit E-9 was not authenticated, it should not have been admitted by the 
Sandiganbayan
.
[133]
           
Exhibit E-9 was not authenticated:
 
 
A review of the records shows that Exhibit E-9 was indeed not 
authenticated. Its due execution and genuineness were not proved by the 
Republic in accordance with Section 20 of Rule 131.


Notably, during the presentation of Manahan, he only authenticated 
his affidavit, and not Exhibit E-9. The transcript of stenographic notes
 taken during his presentation reflect as much: 


 
 
Q 
 
Do
 you recall having executed on January 26, 1989 an Affidavit which we 
have previously marked as Exhibit "E", consisting of twelve pages, and 
which was subscribed and sworn to before Notary Public Estella' Regina 
Q. Bernad, which annexes were marked as Exhibits "E-1" to "E-11"? 
 
 
 
A
 
 
Yes, Ma'am. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
I
 am showing you this Exhibit "E" entitled Affidavit dated January 26, 
1989 together with all its annexes. What is the relation of this 
document to the one that you mentioned?
 
 
 
A
 
 
It is the same, Ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Do
 you confirm that you affixed your signature on the bottom portion on 
each and every page of this Affidavit and above the typewritten name 
Angelo V. Manahan found on page eleven of the said Affidavit?
 
 
 
A 
 
Yes, Ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Mr.
 Manahan, do you affirm the truthfulness of your statement in the said 
affidavit, and do you understand fully its contents and the annexes 
described as Exhibits "E-1" to "E-11"?
 
 
 
A 
 
Y
es, Ma'am
.
[134]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 


The only testimony on Exhibit E-9 was the one provided by Manahan in his affidavit:


16. Exhibit 9 (Document 00727) is a one-page tabulation of nuclear power plant commissions, typed in Mr. Disini's stationery
.
 Although I was HGI's chief financial officer, I was not informed of the
 details of the arrangement under which HGI [received] commissions from 
Westinghouse Electric Corporation ("Westinghouse") in connection with 
the Philippine Nuclear Power Plant ("PNPP"). Anything that related to 
BNPP was treated as secret by Mr. Disini and his close advisors. The 
Westinghouse commission payments were handled by Mr. Jerry Orlina, who 
was Mr. Disini's personal finance officer. The Westinghouse commission 
payments were never received by HGI in the Philippines, and my 
understanding is that they were paid directly into foreign bank 
accounts. The funds from the commissions never entered HGI's treasury.
[135]
 (Emphasis supplied)


Such one-sentence description does not suffice to authenticate the 
document. There was no statement that Exhibit E-9 was genuine and had 
been duly executed or that it was neither spurious nor counterfeit, or 
executed by mistake or under duress.


Notably, the 
Sandiganbayan
 stated in the assailed Decision that Exhibit E-9 was only 
admitted as part of Manahan's testimony
:
[136]


This Court resolved plaintiffs Formal Offer of Evidence in the following manner:


 To 
ADMIT the affidavits marked as Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, XX, 
YY, ZZ and their sub-markings in so far as they were testified on by 
witnesses Rodolfo Jacob, Jesus Vergara, Angelo Manahan and Rafael Sison
, the affiants in the said affidavits. 


x x x x


The documentary evidence presented by the plaintiff were only admitted as part of the testimony of the witnesses
.
 Therefore, these pieces of evidence do not have independent status. Its
 probative force depends entirely on the credibility of the testimony of
 the witness who identified the documents. Nevertheless, the contents of
 the document will be considered part of the narration of the witness.
[137]
 (Emphases supplied)


A document admitted as part of the testimony of a witness does 
not
 constitute proof of the facts stated therein.
[138]

 It merely forms part of the testimony of the witness and does not have 
an independent status. Its probative force depends entirely on the 
credibility of the testimony of which it is a part of.
[139]


Thus, when the 
Sandiganbayan
 admitted Exhibit E-9 as part of 
Manahan's testimony, it ws not supposed to consider Exhibit E-9 as proof
 of the fact stated therein, 
i.e.
, the amount of commissions. The
 Anti-Graft Tribunal was supposed to treat Exhibit E-9 only as part of 
Manahan's testimony. Contrary to its express statement, the 
Sandiganbayan
 actually 
relied
 on Exhibit E-9 to determine the amount of commissions.


In the assailed Decision, the 
Sandiganbayan
 found that the 
total amount of commissions received by Disini in connection with the 
BNPP project supposedly amounted to $50,562,500.00:


According to the testimonies of Manahan and Vergara, Westinghouse 
agreed to pay a commission of 5% of the total contract amount. Asia 
Industries was entitled to get a commission of Â½% of the value of the 
Westinghouse components sold on the nuclear project. Herdis Management 
and Investment Corporation were entitled to a 3% transaction, as 
commission. Technosphere Consultants, Inc. (sic) a Herdis company, 
supposedly obtained a 10% commission from Burns & Roe because of 
Disini's involvement. According to Vergara, the project cost was as much
 as $600 million, and basing on Jacob's testimony, these commissions 
were deposited in the Swiss bank accounts in the name of Disini and his 
immediate family. It appears, however, that the amounts deposited in the
 Swiss bank accounts in the names of Liliana and Herminia Angel Disini 
were already withdrawn as a consequence of the Swiss Federal Court's 
Partial Decision dated August 18, 2006 unblocking the same. This makes 
the issue of the Swiss accounts being held in 
custodia legis
 moot and academic. Disini's own summary of the total commissions generated by this transaction amounting to 
$50,562,500.00
 is as follows: 
[140]
 (Emphasis supplied)

[141]
 
 
 
 
 


Significantly, the amount of $50,562,500.00 does not appear in any of
 the pleadings filed by the parties or in the witnesses' testimonies. It
 appeared for the first time in the assailed Decision. The 
Sandiganbayan
 explained that such amount was arrived at after adding items I to IV bf Exhibit E-9. By adding items I to IV, the 
Sandiganbayan
 clearly relied on Exhibit E-9 to determine the amount of commissions received by Disini.           
The 
Sandiganbayan
 etred in relying on Exhibit E-9:
 
 
 Since Exhibit E-9 was unauthenticated, and thus inadmissible in evidence as proof of the fact stated therein, the 
Sandiganbayan

 should not have relied thereon in determining the exact amount of 
commissions received by Disini. By doing so, it relied on a documentary 
evidence whose due execution and genuineness were not established.


 In addition, We also doubt the use of Exhibit E-9 in the 
determination of the amount of the commissions received by Disini for 
the following reasons: 


First
, Exhibit E-9 is patently vague. It lacks significant 
details such as the date of writing and the author. It uses acronyms 
which meanings were not explained by Manahan nor the Republic. Again, 
the only statement provided by Manahan, 
i.e
., "16. Exhibit 9 
(Document 00727) is a one-page tabulation of nuclear power plant 
commissions, typed in Mr. Disini's stationery," reveals no details as to
 its source nor ownership.


 
Second
, when the 
Sandiganbayan
 reproduced Exhibit E-9 
in the assailed Decision, it omitted the phrase "1/3 Share" amounting to
 "$2.67". It did not explain why the omission was made. 


Third
 there is evident disparity between the amount indicated 
in Exhibit E-9 as the Westinghouse commission, compared to the amount 
cited by the 
Sandiganbayan
 in its assailed Decision: 


According to the testimonies of Manahan and Vergara, Westinghouse agreed to pay a commission of 
5% of the total contract amount
.
 Asia Industries was entitled to get a commission of 1/2% of the value 
of the Westinghouse components sold on the nuclear project. Herdis 
Management and Investment Corporation, were entitled to a 3% 
transaction, as commission. Technosphere Consultants, Inc. (sic) a 
Herdis company, supposedly obtained a 10% commission from Burns & 
Roe because of Disini's involvement. 
According to Vergara, the project cost was as much as $600 million
,
 and basing on Jacob's testimony, these commissions were deposited in 
the Swiss bank accounts in the name of Disini and his immediate family. x
 x x 
[142]
 (Emphases supplied)


Certainly, 5% of the $600,000,000.00, 
i.e.
 US$30,000.00, is 
substantially far from the amount of $19,562,500.00 indicated in Exhibit
 E-9 as the "W Commission", assuming "W" refers to Westinghouse. Indeed,
 the 
Sandiganbayan
 erred when it relied on Exhibit E-9 in arriving at the amount of $50,562,500.00.           
Criminal Cases Nos. 28001-02:
 
 
To further assail Exhibit E-9, Disini points to the existence of 
Manahan's deposition in Criminal Case Nos. 28001-02, where he allegedly 
disowned knowledge of Exhibit E-9.
[143]
 Disini cites the following stenographic notes taken during Manahan's deposition: 


 
 
 
Q: 
 
Thank you. Is it your intention Mr. Manahan to specify that Exhibit "9" is an authentic and accurate tabulation?
 
 
 
A: 
 
I cannot say so because I did not see the originals, Sir. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
And neither did you have any participation in its preparation.
 
 
 
A: 
 
No, Sir, I did not have any participation in its preparation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
May
 I refer you to Exhibit "9" Mr. Manahan, of your Affidavit, which 
according to your affidavit, is one-page tabulation of nuclear power 
plant commissions, typed in Mr. Disini's stationery. My question to you
 Mr. Manahan is, did you have any participation in preparing this 
tabulation? 
 
 
 
A: 
 
No, Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
When for the first time did you see Exhibit"9" 
 
 
 
A:
 
When it was shown to me by the PCGG, Sir
.
[144]
 (Emphases supplied)
 
 
 


In response, the Republic argues that Disini is barred from invoking 
the deposition considering that he was already declared in default.
[145]
 As a consequence of the default order, Disini had lost his standing in court and can no longer present his own evidence.
[146]


We agree with the Republic.           
A party in default may not present its own evidence:
 
 
"A party in default loses [its] right to present evidence, control the proceedings, and examine or cross-examine witnesses."
[147]

 Such party has "no right to expect that [its] pleadings would be acted 
upon by the court nor may be object to or refute evidence or motions 
filed against [it]."
[148]
 


However, while a party in default loses the right to present 
evidence, it retains the right to appeal as part of the remedies 
available to a party in default.
[149]
 The grounds that may be raised in such an appeal are restricted to any of the following: 


Indeed, a defending party declared in default retains the 
right to appeal from the judgment by default. However, the grounds that 
may be raised in such an appeal are restricted to any of the following: 
first,
 the failure of the plaintiff to prove the material allegations of the 
complaint; second, the decision is contrary to law; and third, the 
amount of judgment is excessive or different in kind from that prayed 
for
. x x x
[150]
 (Emphasis supplied)


A party in default is precluded from raising any other ground in its 
appeal from the judgment by default since, otherwise, it would then be 
allowed to adduce evidence in its defense, which right it had lost after
 it was declared in default.
[151]


Here, when Disini was declared in default, he lost his right to 
present evidence. While he retained his right to appeal, which he 
exercised when he filed the Petition, he was proscribed from pleading 
the existence of the deposition in Criminal Case Nos. 28001-02. Thus, we
 do not find any error with the 
Sandiganbayan
's refusal to consider Manahan's deposition in Criminal Case Nos. 28001-02.


 In the same vein, We reject Disini's invocation of the ICA award 
dated December 19, 1991 and the NJDC decision dated July 15, 1993, which
 supposedly cleared him of bribery charges in relation to the 
Westinghouse and B&R contracts. By introducing these new matters, 
Disini is effectively adducing evidence in his defense, which right he 
had lost after he was declared in default.


Nevertheless, it should be noted that while a party in default loses 
its right to present evidence, the court is still supposed to protect 
its right by rendering judgment in accordance with the evidence required
 by law.
[152]
 It may not admit nor rely on incompetent evidence:
[153]


While it may be said that by defaulting, the defendant leaves himself at the mercy of the court, 
the
 rules nevertheless see to it that any judgment against him must be in 
accordance with the evidence required by law. The evidence of the 
plaintiff, presented in the defendant's absence, cannot be admitted if 
it is basically incompetent
. Although the defendant would not be
 in a position to object, elementary justice requires that only legal 
evidence should be considered against him. If the same should prove 
insufficient to justify a judgment for the plaintiff, the complaint must
 be dismissed. And if a favorable judgment is justifiable, it cannot 
exceed in amount or be different in kind from what is prayed for in the 
complaint.
[154]
 (Emphasis supplied)

This is why We overturn the 
Sandiganbayan
's reliance on Exhibit 
E-9, which is inadmissible in evidence to determine the amount of 
commissions received by Disini for being unauthenticated and in 
violation of the Best Evidence Rule. Nonetheless, We recognize that the 
Republic preponderantly proved that Disini indeed received substantial 
commissions and thus, it is entitled to recover even without a definite 
proof of its total amount. In lieu thereof, We grant Republic's claim 
for temperate and exemplary damages.
             
Republic is entitled to temperate and exemplary damages:
 
 
The Republic, in its Amended Complaint,
[155]
 claimed actual, moral, nominal and exemplary damages, to wit: 


19. Fifth Cause of Action LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES - (a) By 
reason of the unlawful acts set forth above, Plaintiff and the Filipino 
people have suffered actual damages in an amount representing the 
pecuniary loss sustained by the latter as a result of Defendants' 
Unlawful acts, the approximate value and interest on which, from the 
time of their wrongful acquisition, plus expenses which Plaintiff has been
 compelled to in4ur and shall continue to incur in its effort to recover
 Defendants' ill-gotten wealth all over the world. Defendants are, 
therefore, jointly and severally liable to Plaintiff for actual damages 
and for expenses incurred in the recovery of Defendants' ill-gotten 
wealth.



(b) As a result of Defendants' unlawful, malicious, immoral and 
wanton acts described above, Plaintiff and the Filipino people had 
painfully endured and suffered for more than twenty long years, and 
still continue to endure and suffer anguish, fright, sleepless nights, 
serious anxiety, wounded feelings and moral shock, as well as besmirched
 reputation and social humiliation before the international community, 
for which Defendants are jointly and severally liable to Plaintiff and 
the Filipino people for moral damages.


(c) In addition, Plaintiff and the Filipino people are entitled to 
temperate damages for their sufferings which, by their very nature, are 
incapable of pecuniary estimation, but which this Honorable Court may 
determine in the exercise of its sound discretion;


 (d) Defendants, by reason of the above described unlawful acts, have
 violated and invaded the inalienable right of Plaintiff and the 
Filipino people to a fair and decent way of life befitting a Nation with
 rich natural and human resources. This basic and fundamental right of 
Plaintiff and the Filipino people should be recognized and vindicated by
 awarding nominal damages in an amount to be determined by the Honorable
 Court in the exercise of its sound discretion.


(e) By way of example and correction for the public good and in order
 to ensure that Defendants' unlawful, malicious, immoral and wanton acts
 are not repeated, said Defendants are jointly and severally liable to 
Plaintiff for exemplary damages.
[156]
 
 


Despite the failure of the Republic to prove the total amount of 
commissions received by Disini, the Court fully recognizes its right to 
recover the ill-gotten wealth. Disini is not at all entitled to these 
commissions as he illegally acquired them through the use of his 
influence and close relationship with President Marcos without rendering
 any service for the benefit of the Republic's BNPP project.


Evidently, Disini unjustly enriched himself by receiving substantial 
commissions from Westinghouse and B&R and acting as the SSR in order
 to ensure the award of the BP project to the said companies by taking 
undue advantage of his close relationship with President Marcos. Article
 22 of the Civil Code provides that "[e]very person who through an 
act or performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes 
into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just 
or legal ground, shall return the same to him."


There is unjust enrichment when a person unjustly retains a benefit 
to the loss of another, or when a person retains money or property of 
another against the fundamental principals of justice, equity and good 
conscience. The principle of unjust enrichment essentially contemplates 
payment when there is no duty to pay, and the person who receives the 
payment has no right to receive it.
[157]


 We further elucidated on the concept of enrichment in 
University of the Philippines v. PHILAB Industries, Inc.
:
[158]


Unjust enrichment is a term used to depict result or 
effect of failure to make remuneration of or for property or benefits 
received under circumstances that give rise to legal or equitable 
obligation to account for them; to be entitled to remuneration, one must
 confer benefit by mistake, fraud, coercion, or request. Unjust 
enrichment is not itself a theory of reconvey. Rather, it is a 
prerequisite for the enforcement of the doctrine of restitution.
[159]


Also, in 
Reyes v. Lim
,
[160]

 the court may, in the exercise of equity jurisdiction, make a ruling 
despite the "silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws," thus: 


The instant case, however, is precisely one where there is a 
hiatus
 in the law and in the Rules of Court. If left alone, the 
hiatus

 will result in unjust enrichment to Reyes at the expense of Lim. The 
hiatus may also imperil restitution, which is a precondition to the 
rescission of the Contract to Sell that Reyes himself seeks. This is not
 a case of equity overruling a positive provision of law or judicial 
rule for there is none that governs this particular case. This is a case
 of silence or insufficiency of the law and the Rules of Court. 
In
 this case, Article 9 of the Civil Code expressly mandates the courts to
 make a ruling despite the "silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the 
laws." This calls for the application of equity, which "fills the open 
spaces in the law.
" 


Thus, the trial court in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction may 
validly order the deposit of the P10 million down payment in court. 
The
 purpose of the exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case is to 
prevent unjust enrichment and to ensure restitution. Equity jurisdiction
 aims to do complete justice in cases where a court of law is unable to 
adapt its judgments to the special circumstances of a case because of 
the inflexibility of its statutory or legal jurisdiction. Equity is the 
principle by which substantial justice may be attained in cases where 
the prescribed or customary forms of ordinary law are inadequate
.
[161]
 (Emphasis supplied.)


In fine, the Republic's failure to particularly prove the actual 
amount of commissions received by Disini should not override its right 
to recover the illegally-acquired commissions considering the fact that 
it has satisfactorily established, by preponderance of evidence, 
Disini's receipt thereof. Necessarily, public funds were released for 
the construction of the BNPP project. Disini indirectly amassed a 
portion of these public funds through commissions paid by Westinghouse 
and B&R. These commissions or "kickbacks" are not only illegal or 
fraudulent but detrimental to the Republic and highly unfair and 
prejudicial to ordinary Filipino taxpayers.


However, actual damages to be recoverable must be supported by 
evidence on record and cannot be left merely to the discretion of the 
court. While We affirm the Republic's entitlement to recover Disini's 
ill-gotten wealth, no other evidence was presented to show the definite 
amount thereof. The Republic failed to substantiate its claim for actual
 pecuniary loss or damages sustained by reason of Disini's acquisition of
 ill-gotten wealth.


While it is true that the Republic failed to prove the amount of 
commissions received, this does not mean, however, that Disini is free 
from any liability under this civil action for reconveyance, reversion, 
accounting, restitution and damages. Thus, under the principle of unjust
 enrichment, We uphold the Republic's right to recover these commissions
 in favor of the Filipino people. No one should unjustly enrich himself 
by receiving commissions in connection with a government project when 
clearly he has no right for it nor entitled to retain the same.


 Nonetheless, since recovery thereof cannot be effected due to the 
absence of a definite amount, We deem it proper to award the Republic 
temperate damages for the pecuniary loss and the Filipino people 
suffered on account of Disini's illegal acquisitions of substantial 
commissions from Westinghouse and B&R, albeit the amount thereof not
 being proven with certainty. Under Article 2224 of the Civil Code, 
temperate or moderate damages, which are more than nominal but less than
 compensatory damages, may be recovered when the court finds that some 
pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature 
of: the case, be determined with certainty. In 
Araneta v. Bank of America
,
[162]
 the concept of temperate damages is explained thus: 


The Code commission, in explaining the concept of temperate damages under Article 2224, makes the following comment:


"In some States of the American Union, temperate d ages are allowed. 
There
 are cases where from the nature of the case, definite proof of 
pecuniary loss cannot be offered although the court is convinced that 
there has been such loss.
 For instance, injury to one's 
commercial credit or to the goodwill of a business firm is often hard to
 show with certainty in terms of money. Should damages be denied for 
that reason? The judge should be empowered to calculate moderate damages
 in such cases, rather than that the plaintiff should suffer, without 
redress from the defendant's wrongful act."
[163]
 (Emphasis supplied)




In 
Seven Brothers Shipping Corp. v. DMC-Construction Resources, Inc.
,
[164]

 the Court enumerated the cases where temperate damages were rightly 
granted and awarded when proof of the actual amount was not duly proved,
 to wit:


In contrast, under Article 2224, temperate or moderate 
damages may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss 
has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be
 provided with certainty. This principle was thoroughly explained in
 Araneta v. Bank of America
, which cited the Code Commission, to wit:

The Code Commission, in explaining the concept of temperate damages under Article 2224, makes the following comment:


 In some States of the American Union, temperate damages are 
allowed. There are cases where from the nature of the case, definite 
proof of pecuniary loss cannot be offered, although the court is 
convinced that there has been such loss. For instance, injury to one's 
commercial credit or to the goodwill of a business firm is often hard to
 show with certainty in terms of money. Should damages be denied for 
that reason? The judge should be empowered to calculate moderate damages
 in such cases, rather than that the plaintiff should suffer, without 
redress from the defendant's wrongful act.


Thus, in 
Tan v. OMC Carriers, Inc.
, temperate damages were 
rightly awarded because plaintiff suffered a loss, although definitive 
proof of its amount cannot be presented as the photographs produced as 
evidence were deemed insufficient. Established in that case, however, 
was the fact that respondent's truck was responsible for the damage to 
petitioner's property and that petitioner suffered some form of 
pecuniary loss. In 
Canada v. All Commodities Marketing Corporation
,
 temperate damages were also awarded wherein respondent's goods did not 
reach the Pepsi Cola Plant at Muntinlupa City as a result of the 
negligence of petitioner in conducting its trucking and hauling 
services, even if the amount of the pecuniary loss had not been proven. 
In 
Philtranco Services Enterprises, Inc. v. Paras
, the respondent
 was likewise awarded temperate damages in an action for breach of 
contract of carriage, even if his medical expenses had not been 
established with certainty. In 
People v. Briones
, in which the 
accused was found guilty of murder, temperate damages were given even if
 the funeral expenses for the victim had not been sufficiently proven.
[165]
 (Citations omitted)


Here, the Republic is entitled to recover temperate damages as there 
is no doubt that Disini trampled on the rights of the Filipino people to
 benefit from, and make good use of, these ill-gotten wealth, 
i.e
.,
 substantial commissions or kickbacks he acquired; and that the whole 
nation significantly suffered pecuniary loss due to Disini's illegal 
acquisition of these public funds.


 In assessing the amount of such damages, Article 2216 of the Civil Code provides: 


Art. 2216. No proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order 
that moral, nominal, temperate, liquidated or exemplary damages, may be 
adjudicated. The assessment of such damages, except liquidated ones, is 
left to the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances 
of each case.


Considering the relevant circumstances of this case, the amount of 
One Billion Pesos (P1,000,000,000.00) as temperate damages is reasonable
 and justified. It bears stressing that this is not just an ordinary 
civil action for recovery of property and damages. This is an action 
for recovery of ill-gotten wealth which is imbued Â·with public interest 
and concerns not only the government but every Filipino citizen, then 
and now. As part of the healing process of this nation, the Freedom 
Constitution specifically mandates the President to prioritize the 
recovery of these ill-gotten wealth. Hence, the loss or injury suffered 
by every Filipino due to Disini's acquisition of ill-gotten wealth must 
be duly recognized and compensated.


Further, We note that the Filipino people have not at all benefitted 
from the BNPP as it has remained inoperable as of this writing, a 
proverbial White Elephant. Obviously, a considerable amount of public 
funds had been invested and allocated for the construction of the BNPP, 
which funds came from the blood, sweat and tears of the Filipino 
taxpayers. The ill-gotten wealth should have been used and spent or and 
by the rightful owner thereof and not just by one person or a select 
group of people in power.


Also, the Republic was unduly deprived of its rights over these 
substantial commissions as part of public funds, and was compelled to 
litigate for their recovery for more than three decades. We cannot 
overemphasize that Disini received these ill-gotten wealth starting in 
1976 when the construction of the BNPP began. Consequently, he had 
profited immensely from these commissions for a significant portion of 
his lifetime at the expense of the Filipinos.


 Taking into consideration the inflation rate and the Philippine 
Peso's purchasing power at that time, these substantial commissions, if 
recovered, would have been greatly valued now and could have been used 
for the betterment of the Philippines. In addition, the Republic would 
have been entitled to recover legal interest on the total amount of 
commissions received had it proved such.


 Undeniably, the recovery of these illegally acquired public funds, 
properties and assets has great impact on every Filipino's life. Hence, 
the award of One Billion Pesos (P1,000,000,000.00) temperate damages is 
reasonable under the circumstances taking into consideration the rights 
of all Filipino citizens encroached upon by Disini's acquisition of 
ill-gotten wealth and the damage caused to the Republic for its failure 
to make good use of the same.


With the grant of temperate damages, this allows the imposition of 
exemplary damages by way of example or correction for the public good.
[166]
 Exemplary damages cannot be recovered as a matter of right
[167]
 and are only considered when moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages are granted.
[168]

 "Exemplary damages are designed by our civil law to permit the courts 
to reshape behavior that is socially deleterious in its consequence by 
creating negative incentives or deterrents against such behavior."
[169]

 Its purpose is to serve as a deterrent to serious wrong doings and as a
 vindication of undue sufferings and wanton invasion of the rights of an
 injured or a punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct.
[170]


 There is no doubt that Disini's receipt of thee substantial 
commissions from Westinghouse and B&R is illegal and despicable 
which is no less than abhorred by our Freedom Constitution as its 
mandate includes eradication of graft and corruption, punishment of 
those guilty thereof and recovery of illÂ­-gotten wealth. Verily, Disini's
 conduct should be corrected and deterred as his use of influence or 
power for his own personal benefit to the detriment of the Republic 
caused substantial injury not only to public funds but to the morale, 
trust and confidence of Filipinos in the government and its projects. 
Hence, this Court finds it reasonable under the circumstances to award 
One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) as exemplary damages.


Nevertheless, the Republic is not entitled to nominal damages as it 
is incompatible with the award of temperate damages. Nominal damages are
 recoverable where a legal right is technically violated and must be 
vindicated against an invasion that has produced no actual present loss 
of any kind or where there has been a breach of contract but no 
substantial injury or actual damages whatsoever have been or can be 
shown.
[171]
 Clearly, Disini's 
illegal acquisition of substantial commissions from Westinghouse and 
B&R produces injury or damage to the Republic which has been 
deprived the use of these public funds in the interest of the Filipinos.


In the same manner, moral damages cannot be awarded in favor of the 
Republic as it failed to convince this Court that it suffered any form 
of physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, 
besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, 
social-humiliation, or any other similar circumstance because of 
Disini's acquisition of ill-gotten wealth.
[172]
 


Finally, the monetary awards shall earn the legal interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from the finality of this Decision until their satisfaction.
[173]


III


In summary, We find that the 
Sandiganbayan
 did not err in 
finding Disini liable for the commissions he received from Westinghouse 
and B&R in relation to the BNPP project. The Republic had 
preponderantly proved the: (a) existence of the Westinghouse and B&R
 commissions and their respective commission agreements; and (b) 
Disini's receipt thereof based on the testimonies of Jacob and Vergara. 
However, the 
Sandiganbayan
 erred in relying on Exhibit E-9 to 
determine the exact amount of commissions the Republic is entitled to 
recover. Nonetheless, We deem it proper to grant the Republic: (a) 
temperate damages in the amount of One Billion Pesos (P1,000,000,000.00)
 to compensate for the Republic's pecuniary loss by reason of Disini's 
acquisition of ill-gotten wealth; and (b) exemplary damages in the 
amount of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) to set an example and to 
serve as a deterrent to socially deleterious actions, such as 
acquisition of illÂ­-gotten wealth. The Court further validates the 
express findings of the 
Sandiganbayan
 that former President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos and former First Lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos had no
 participation whatsoever with regard to Disini's illicit dealings in 
the BNPP Project.


 Lastly, We sternly remind Disini's counsel of record, Bernas Law 
Offices, to strictly observe court deadlines. The Petition was filed 
almost two (2) months late.
[174]

 On this ground alone, We could have already dismissed it, if not only 
for the importance of the issues involved. But this case has 
unfortunately gone on for too long; its definitive resolution is long 
overdue. We therefore remind all the parties that any further perceived 
attempt to delay its resolution shall not merit this Court's liberality.
 


WHEREFORE
, the Petition is 
GRANTED in PART
. The assailed April 11, 2012 Decision and October 24, 2012 Resolution of the 
Sandiganbayan
 in Civil Case No. 0013 are hereby 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
. The order to account and reconvey $50,562,500.00 is 
DELETED
 for lack of basis. Instead, petitioner is 
DIRECTED to PAY

 the Republic of the Philippines temperate damages in the amount of One 
Billion Pesos (P1,000,000,000.00), and exemplary damages in the amount 
of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00). These monetary awards shall earn 
legal interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from the finality of this Decision until their full satisfaction.

 See 
Tiburcio v. Castro
,
 244 Phil. 599,602 (1988), where the following remedies were enumerated:


Under the Rules of Court, there are several remedies available to a 
defaulted party, namely:


a) The defendant in default may, at any time after discovery thereof and
 before judgment, file a motion, under oath, to set aside the order of 
default on the ground that his failure to answer was due to fraud, 
accident, mistake or excusable neglect, and that he has meritorious 
defenses; (Sec. 3, Rule 18)


b) If the judgment has already been rendered when the defendant 
discovered the default, but before the same has become final and 
executory, he may file a motion for new trial under Section 1(a) of Rule
 37;


c) If the defendant discovered the default after the judgment has become
 final and executory, he may file a petition for relief under Section 2 
of Rule 38; and


d) He may also appeal from the judgment rendered against him as contrary
 to the evidence or to the law, even if no petition to set aside the 
order of default has been presented by him. (Sec. 2, Rule 41) (

, 135 SCRA 637, 642).
