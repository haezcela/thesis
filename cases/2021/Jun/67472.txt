SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM (SSS), PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT (COA), RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




ROSARIO, J.:




This is a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 64 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking to reverse and set aside the 8 May 2014 Decision
[1]
 and the 20 November 2014 Resolution
[2]
 of the Commission on Audit (COA) in Decision No. 2014-069. 

The Facts


On 6 July 2005, the Social Security Commission (SSC) issued Resolution No. 259, Series of 2005,
[3]
 granting the following:


 1. P20,000.00 Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) incentive to 
each Social Security System (SSS) employee covered within the collective
 negotiating unit as of 31 December 2004 and who had at least three (3) 
months prior service in the SSS; and


 2. Counterpart benefit to the CNA Incentive of equivalent amount to 
SSS personnel who are not covered by the collective negotiating unit, 
which include confidential, coterminous and contractual employees, 
lawyers and executives.


On post-audit, the SSS Supervising Auditor, under Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. SSS-2007-001 (2005),
[4]

 dated 9 January 2007, disallowed the above second category benefit 
(counterpart CNA benefit) in the aggregate amount of P6,180,000.00 for 
violation of Section 3(b) of Administrative Order No. 103, dated 31 
August 2004,
[5]
 and Section 3 of Executive Order No. 180, dated June 1, 1987.
[6]

 These provisions prohibit the grant of CNA benefits to high-level and 
confidential employees, and to those who are not eligible to join the 
organization of rank-and-file government employees for purposes of 
collective negotiation since collective negotiation (CN) benefits arise 
out of membership in the collective negotiation unit.


Citing the contributions of confidential, coterminous and contractual
 employees, lawyers and executives to the overall efficiency of their 
agency, the SSS appealed the disallowance to the Legal Services Sector 
(LSS) of the COA. However, the latter denied the same in LSS Decision 
No. 2010-025, dated 5 August 2010. The LSS held, 
inter alia
, that
 only rank-and-file employees are entitled to the benefits and/or 
incentives arising from the execution of the CNA, and high-level 
employees, who are not considered party-in-interest to the CNA, are not 
entitled thereto.


Aggrieved, the SSS filed a petition for review before the COA Commission Proper 
En Banc
 on 3 January 2011. On 8 May 2014, the COA Commission Proper 
En Banc

 rendered the assailed Decision No. 2014-069, denying SSS' petition for 
lack of merit and affirming the decision of the LSS. SSS received the 
decision on 15 May 2014.


 The dispositive portion ofCOA Decision No. 2014-069 reads: 


"WHEREFORE
, this Commission hereby 
DENIES
 the Petition for Review for lack of merit and 
AFFIRMS

 Legal Services Sector Decision No. 2010-025 dated August 2010 and 
Notice of Disallowance No. SSS-2007-001 (2005) dated January 9, 2007 
disallowing the payment of Counterpart Collective Negotiation Agreement 
Benefits to Social Security System employees who are not covered by the 
collective negotiating unit in the total amount of P6,180,000.00."
[7]


From this decision, the SSS filed a motion for reconsideration on 11 
June 2014, but the same was denied by the COA Commission Proper En Banc,
 as shown in the Notice, dated 4 February 2015 and received by SSS on 
the same date.
[8]
 The Notice states thatâ


"Please take notice that the Commission Proper (CP) 
en banc
 issued a Resolution on November 20, 2014, which reads as follows: 


xxxx


The CP denied the Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit. The 
movant failed to raise a new matter or show sufficient ground to justify
 a reconsideration of COA Decision No. 2014-069 dated May 8, 2014."'


On 13 February 2015, the SSS filed a 
Manifestation with Motion for
 Clarification and Disclosure of Resolution, dated 20 November 2014, and
 Minutes of the Meeting of the Commission Proper
,
[9]

 requesting that it be provided with a certified true copy of the 
purported minutes "categorically and squarely addressing and clarifying"
 how the issues raised in its motion for reconsideration were evaluated 
and specifically resolved.
[10]


On 12 March 2015, the COA responded with a Letter
[11]

 stating that the resolution of the Commission Proper is copied verbatim
 in the Notice. Further, the COA explained that the format of the Notice
 denying the motion for reconsideration is expressly allowed by 
COAResolution No. 2013-018, dated 30 September 2013, amending Section 
12, Rule X of the 2009 Revised Rules ofProcedure of the COA.


The Petition and Comment


On 20 March 2015, the SSS filed the instant petition under Rule 64, citing the following grounds for its allowance:


I. RESPONDENT'S DECISION AFFIRMING ND NO. 2007-001 (2005)
 DATED 9 JANUARY 2007 AND ITS PURPORTED RESOLUTION DISMISSING 
PETITIONER'S MR MENTIONED IN THE UNDATED NOTICE OF RESPONDENT'S 
COMMISSION SECRETARY ARE CONTRARY TO FACTS, LAWS AND THE BASIC NOTION OF
 FAIR PLAY;


 II. RESPONDENT'S DECISION NOT TO DISCLOSE AND FURNISH PETITIONER 
WITH ITS PURPORTED RESOLUTION DATED 20 NOVEMBER 2014 AND THE MINUTES OF 
THE MEETING SUPPOSEDLY SIGNED BY THE MEMBERS OF RESPONDENT IS VIOLATIVE 
OF DUE PROCESS AND AMOUNTS TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO 
LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION.
[12]


In its Comment,
[13]
 filed on 2 November 2015, the COA Commission Proper, through the Office of the Solicitor General, countered that:


I. THE INSTANT PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WAS FILED OUT OF 
TIME IN VIOLATION OF THE PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF THE RULES OF COURT AND 
THE 2009 REVISED RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT (RRPC);


II. COA DID NOT COMMIT GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR
 EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN RENDERING THE ASSAILED DECISIONS SINCE THEY 
ARE IN CONSONANCE WITH PREVAILING LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND 
ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE;


III. COA DID NOT COMMIT GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK 
OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN RENDERING THE ASSAILED DECISIONS SINCE 
THERE IS LACK OF LEGAL AND FACTUAL BASES FOR PETITIONER TO GRANT 
COUNTERPART CNA BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES NOT COVERED BY THE COLLECTIVE 
NEGOTIATING UNIT;


 IV. COA DID NOT COM1vfiT GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK
 OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION SINCE COA VALIDLY RENDERED ITS DECISION ON 
PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND THAT PETITIONER RECEIVED A 
COPY OF THE COMMISSION PROPER EN BANC RESOLUTION DATED NOVEMBER 20, 
2014.


The Issues


Presented, thus, for Our consideration are the following issues: (1) 
whether the instant petition was timely filed; (2) whether the COA 
committed grave abuse of discretion in denying SSS' motion for 
reconsideration through the assailed Notice; and (3) whether the COA 
committed grave abuse of discretion in upholding the disallowance of the
 grant of CNA incentives to non-members of the negotiating unit.


The Court's Ruling


 


The instant petition was

filed beyond the 30-day

reglementary period


provided in Rule 64; thus,

COA's 8 May 2014

Decision had already

become final and

executory when this


petition was filed on 20

March 2015.


At the outset, the Court notes that the instant petition was filed 
out of time. Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court provides:


"S
EC. 3.
 
T
ime to file petition
. 
The petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days from notice of the 
judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed. The filing 
of a motion for new trial or reconsideration of said judgment or final 
order or resolution, if allowed under the procedural rules of the 
Commission concerned, shall interrupt the period herein fixed. If the 
motion is denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the 
remaining period, but which 
shall not be less than five (5) days
 in any event, reckoned from notice of denial."


Petitioner admits that the COA Decision was promulgated on 8 May 2014
 and it received a copy thereof on 15 May 2014. Thus, the 30 day-period 
should have ended on 14 June 2014. However, following Section 3, Rule 
64, the period was interrupted when petitioner filed a motion for 
reconsideration on 11 June 2014, leaving 3 days extended to 5 days by 
the same Rule - within which to file this petition.


Since petitioner received a copy of the Notice denying its motion for
 reconsideration on 4 February 2015, it had 5 more days from said date, 
or until 9 February 2015 to file its petition before the Court. However,
 the record shows that petitioner filed its petition only on 20 March 
2015 or 
39 days after the last day of filing
. Thus, there is no dispute that petitioner belatedly filed the instant petition before the Court.


 
COA correctly denied

SSS' motion for


reconsideration through

the Notice, dated 4


February 2015.


 Petitioner mistakenly posits that the Notice of denial of its motion
 for reconsideration, dated and received on 4 February 2015, did not 
restart the running of its 30-day period to file the instant petition 
because it was not presented in the format of a resolution. We do not 
agree.


 COA Resolution No. 2013-018 dated 30 September 2013, amending 
Section 12, Rule X of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA,
[14]
 prescribes the format of the Notice when the COA Commission Proper denies a motion for reconsideration, to wit: 


"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, as it is hereby RESOLVED, to modify Section 12, Rule X of the RRPC to read as follows: 


'Section 12. Effect of Motion for Reconsideration and How It is Disposed Of.- xxx xxx xxx


In case the Commission Proper denies a Motion for 
Reconsideration for having been filed out of time, or for failure to 
raise any new matter or other sufficient ground to }ustifY a 
reconsideration thereof, the Secretary of the Commission shall issue a 
Notice to the parties, within five (5) days from the time the relevant 
Minutes of Meeting of the Commission Proper are signed, informing them 
of the Resolution of the Commission Proper. The Notice shall be in the 
form herewith attached as Annex 'A'."


The above-stated Annex "A" reads: 


"[COA Letterhead]

ENBANC

NOTICE



Sirs/Mesdames: 


"Please take notice that the Commission Proper en banc issued a Resolution dated
 

 which reads as follows:

'[Cite Case No.] (Cite Title of the Case).- The Commission Proper 
Resolved to DISMISS the Motion for Reconsideration on [CITE GROUND]


Very truly yours,





Secretary of the Commission'"


We note that this is the very format assumed by the Notice of denial 
of SSS' motion for reconsideration received by petitioner on 4 February 
2015; hence, there is no doubt as to its validity. Petitioner's stance -
 rejecting this Notice officially prescribed by the COA Rules of 
Procedure, yet conveniently adopting a mere letter, dated 12 March 2015,
[15]

 as the reckoning point of the period to file a petition before the 
Court highlights its awareness that when it filed the instant petition 
on 20 March 2015, the petition was filed beyond the 30-day reglementary 
period prescribed in Rule 64.


At any rate, even if the Court were to adopt 12 March 2015 as the 
date when SSS' period to file this petition restarted, SSS would still 
have only 5 more days to file the instant petition, or until 17 March 
2015. Thus, the filing of the instant petition on 20 March 2015 would 
still be late.


Assuming arguendo that


the petition was timely

filed, COA did not commit


grave abuse of discretion

in affirming the denial of


SSS' grant of counterpart

CNA benefits to high-

ranking officers,

managers, lawyers,

coterminous and highly

confidential employees

who are not members of

the negotiating unit.
 


In 
Madera vs. Commission on Audit et al
.,
[16]

 this Court, speaking through the Honorable Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. 
Caguioa, had occasion to explain why judicial review of COA decisions is
 limited to errors of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Said this Court in that 
case: 


"The Constitution vests the broadest latitude in the COA 
in discharging its role as the guardian of public funds and properties. 
In recognition of such constitutional empowerment, the Court has 
generally sustained the COA's decisions or resolutions in deference to 
its expertise in the implementation of the laws it has been entrusted to
 enforce. 
Thus, the Constitution and the Rules of Court provide 
the remedy of a petition for certiorari in order to restrict the scope 
of inquiry to errors of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the COA
.
 For this purpose, grave abuse of discretion means that there is, on the
 part ofthe COA, an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to 
perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such 
as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law
 and the evidence but on caprice, whim and despotism." (emphasis 
supplied)


In this case, the COA committed no such abuse. Petitioner SSS failed 
to show that in affirming the subject notices of denial, the COA 
rendered a decision that was not based on law and evidence.


 On the contrary, in ruling that only rank-and-file employees are 
entitled to the benefits and/or incentives arising from the execution of
 the CNA, and that high-level employees - such as lavvyers, managers, 
executives, coterminous and highly confidential employees, who are not 
parties-inÂ­interest to the CNA- are not entitled thereto, the COA 
applied the following laws and regulations: (1) Presidential Decree No. 
1597; (2) Executive Order No. 180; (3) Administrative Order No. 103 s. 
2004; (4) PSLMC Resolution No.4 s. 2002 and PSLMC Resolution No.2 s. 
2003; (5) Administrative Order No. 135; and (6) DBM Budget Circular 
2006-1. We tackle each legal basis below.


 Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 1597 (1978) states that 
allowances, honoraria and other fringe benefits which may be granted to 
government employees, whether payable by their respective offices or by 
other agencies of government, shall be 
subject to the approval of the President

 upon recommendation of the Commissioner of the Budget. Stated 
otherwise, only those allowances and incentives specifically authorized 
by the President may be given.


 In turn, Section 3 of Executive Order No. 180, issued by Former 
President Corazon C. Aquino on 1 June 1987, specifically states that 
highÂ­level employees, whose functions are nonnally considered as 
policy-making
 or 
managerial
 or whose duties are of a 
highly confidential
 nature shall not be eligible to join the organization of rank-and-file government employees
.


Further, Section 3(b) of Administrative Order No. 103, issued on 31 
August 2004 by Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, suspends the 
grant of new or additional benefits to full-time officials and employees
 and officials, except for CNA Benefits, which are to be given only upon
 
strict compliance
 with PSLMC Resolution No. 4, s. 2002, and PSLMC Resolution No.2, s. 2003.


In turn, the above-mentioned PSLMC Resolutions 4 and 2 provide for the grant of CNA Benefits 
only to rank-and-file employees

 of governmentÂ­ owned and controlled corporations, government financial 
institutions, national government agencies, local government units, and 
state universities and colleges.


 Section 2 of Administrative Order No. 135, issued on 27 December 
2005 by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, reiterates the limit 
of the 
grant of CNA Benefits only to rank-and-file employees of the government.


 Section 4.2 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget 
Circular 2006-1, dated 1 February 2006, defines rank-and-file employees 
as 
those who are 
not managerial
 employees; 
not coterminous
 employees; and not highly confidential employees.
 


Taking all the foregoing provisions together, the inescapable 
conclusion is that high-level managerial and confidential employees are 
not entitled to CNA benefits because they cannot become members of the 
negotiating unit. It is of no moment that high-level managerial and 
confidential employees also contributed to the efficiency of the agency.
 The laws are very clear in stating that only rank-and-file employees 
who are members of the negotiating unit are entitled to CNA benefits.


Moreover, the Court tinds that the grant of "counterpart" CNA incentives in 
the fixed amount of P20.000.00 is contrary to Section 5.6 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-1

 insofar as the same prescribes that no incentive amount shall be 
predetermined in the CNAs since the amount of incentive ought to be 
dependent on the cost-cutting measures specified under the CNA or its 
supplements.


For all the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the COA committed
 no grave abuse of discretion in upholding the disallowance of the grant
 of CNA "counterpart" incentives to highly confidential and cotenninous 
employees of the SSS who are not members of the negotiating unit, 
including lawyers and executives.


 The certifying and

approving

officers and the

individual employees

are all liable to return

the disallowed

amounts.


In the 2020 case of 
SSS vs. COA
[17]
 (
SSS 2020
),
 the Court, speaking through the Honorable Associate Justice C. Amy 
Lazaro-Javier, enumerated the statutory provisions that identify the 
persons liable to return the disallowed amounts. Thus:


 1. Section 43, Chapter V, Book VI of the 1987Achninistrative Code: 


Section 43.
 
Liability for Illegal Expenditures
.
 - Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in violation 
of the provisions of this Code or of the general and special provisions 
contained in the annual General or other Appropriations Act shall be 
void. 
Every payment made in violation of said provisions shall be 
illegal and every official or employee authorizing or making such 
payment, or taking part therein, and every person receiving such payment
 shall be jointly and severally liable to the Government for the full 
amount so paid or received
.


 xxx xxx xxx


2. Sections 38 and 39, Chapter 9, book I, of the 1987 Administrative Code.


Section 38.
 
Liability of Superior Officers
. -


(1) A public officer shall not be civilly liable for acts done in the
 performance of his official duties, unless there is a clear showing of 
bad faith, malice or gross negligence.


 (2) Any public officer who, without just cause, neglects to perform a
 duty within a period fixed by law or regulation, or within a reasonable
 period if none is fixed, shall be liable for damages to the private 
party concerned without prejudice to such other liability as may be 
prescribed by law.


 (3) A head of a department or a superior officer shall not be 
civilly liable for the wrongful acts, omissions of duty, negligence, or 
misfeasance of his subordinates, unless he has actually authorized by 
written order the specific act or misconduct complained of.


 
Section 39.
 
Liability of Subordinate Officers
. - No 
subordinate officer or employee shall be civilly liable for acts done by
 him in good faith in the performance of his duties. However, he shall 
be liable for willful or negligent acts done by him which are contrary 
to law, morals, public policy and good customs even if he acted under 
orders or instructions of his superiors.


3. Section 52, Chapter 9, Title I-B, Book V of the 1987 Administrative


Section 52.
 General Liability for Unlawful Expenditures
. - Expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations 
shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor


4. Sections 102 and 103, Ordaining and Instituting a Government Auditing Code of the Philippines:


Section 102
.

1. The head of any agency of the government is immediately and 
primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining 
to his agency.


2. Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or

without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.


 
Section 103
. 
General liability for unlawful expenditures
.
 Expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in 
violation of law or regulations shall be a personal liability of the 
official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor.


5. Section 49 of Presidential Decree 1177 (PD 1177) or the Budget Reform Decree of 1977:


Section 49. 
Liability for Illegal Expenditure
. 
Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in violation of 
the provisions of this Decree or of the general and special provisions 
contained in the annual General or other Appropriations Act shall be 
void. Every payment made in violation of said provisions shall be 
illegal and every official or employee authorizing or making such 
payment, or taking part therein, and 
every person receiving such 
payment shall be jointly and severally liable to the Government for the 
full amount so paid or received
.


xxx xxx xxx 


6. Section 19 of the Manual of Certificate of Settlement and Balances:


19.1 The liability of public officers and other persons 
for audit disallowances shall be determined on the basis of: (a) the 
nature of the disallowance; (b) the duties, responsibilities or 
obligations of the officers/persons concerned; (c) the extent of their 
participation or involvement in the disallowed transaction; and (d) the 
amount of losses or damages suffered by the government thereby. The 
following are illustrative examples:


 19.1.1 Public officers who are custodians of government funds and/or
 properties shall be liable for their failure to ensure that such funds 
and properties are safely guarded against loss or damage; that they are 
expended, utilized, disposed of or transferred in accordance with law 
and regulations, and on the basis of prescribed documents and necessary 
records.


19.1.2 Public officers who certify to the necessity, legality and 
availability of funds/budgetary allotments, adequacy of documents, etc. 
involving the expenditure of funds or uses of government property shall 
be liable according to their respective certifications.


 19.1.3 Public officers who approve or authorize transactions 
involving the expenditure of government funds and uses of government 
properties shall be liable for all losses arising out of their 
negligence or failure to exercise the diligence of a good father of a 
family. (emphasis supplied)

On the other hand, in 
Madera, et. al v. COA
[18]
 (
Madera
),
 the Court summarized the rules regarding the liability of the 
certifying and approving officers and recipient employees, as follows:

"1. If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the 
Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable 
therein.


2. If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:


a) Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in 
regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a 
good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent 
with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.


b) Approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have 
acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section
 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarity liable to return only
 the net disallowed amount which, as discussed herein, excludes amounts 
excused under the following Sections 2c and 2d.


c) Recipients - whether approving or certifying officers or mere 
passive recipients - are liable to return the disallowed amounts 
respectively received by them, unless they are able to show that the 
amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of services 
rendered.


d) The Court may likewise excuse the return of recipients based on 
undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other bona fide 
exceptions as it may determine on a case to case basis."


Applying the law, and the cases of SSS 2020 and Madera to the instant case, the Court finds that 
the
 approving and certifying officers of SSS who authorized the payment of 
the disallowed amounts and the employees who received the same are 
liable to return them.


While there is a presumption that the approving and certifying 
officers granted the disallowed benefits acted in good faith in the 
performance of their official duties, this 
presumption of goodfaith fails when an explicit law, rule, or regulation has been violated
.
[19]


As the Court has previously stated, in granting the CNA to high 
ranking officials and non rank-and-file employees, the approving and 
certifying officers violated the following laws and regulations: (1) 
Presidential Decree No. 1597; (2) Executive Order No. 180; (3) 
Administrative Order No. 103 s. 2004; (4) PSLMC Resolution No. 4 s. 2002
 and PSLMC Resolution No. 2 s. 2003; (5) Administrative Order No. 135; 
and (6) DBM Budget Circular 2006-1. These laws were already in force at 
the time when the officials concerned wrongfully and willfully granted 
the CNA benefits. Thus, good faith cannot be appreciated on their part 
and they must be made to return the disallowed amounts.


The SSS 2020 and 
Madera
 cases also support our conclusion that the recipient employees are liable to return the disallowed payments on ground of 
solutio indebiti
,
 as a result of the mistake in payment. The recipient employees are 
clearly disqualified from receiving the disallowed CNA incentives and 
prejudice to the government would result if they do not return what they
 unduly received. 


WHEREFORE, 
the petition is 
DISMISSED
. The 8 May 2014 
Decision and the 20 November 2014 Resolution of the Commission on Audit 
in Decision No. 2014-069, respectively, are 
AFFIRMED
