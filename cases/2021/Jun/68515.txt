INTING, J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 

Certiorari
[1]
 of the Decision

 dated June 28, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated March 5, 2019 of
 the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 103874. The CA affirmed 
with modification only as to the payment of legal interest the 
Decision
[4]
 dated 
September 18, 2014 of Branch 172, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Valenzuela
 City in Civil Case No. 
248-V-07.
The 
Antecedents
On December 7, 
2007, the Republic of the Philippines (petitioner) filed a verified 
Complaint
[5]
 for 
the expropriation of portions of the three parcels of land (subject 
properties) located at 
Brgy.
 Ugong, Valenzuela City 
allegedly owned by spouses Luis J. Dela Cruz (Luis) and Imelda Reyes 
(Imelda) (collectively, Spouses Dela Cruz). The subject properties were 
described as follows:

[7]
Petitioner
 alleged in the complaint the purpose of the expropriation, to 
wit:
Pursuant to Sec. 7 of E.O. 1035, the 
DPWH is implementing the construction of C-5 Northern Link Road Project,
 Segment 8.1 from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to the Northern Luzon 
Expressway, Valenzuela City, to provide faster and comfortable travel to
 the motoring public going to, or coming from. Northern Luzon, thru 
Metro Manila.
[8]
Petitioner 
manifested its willingness to pay the amount of P495,200.07 as just 
compensation for the affected areas based on the zonal value of the 
subject lots at P2,750.00 per square meter, as certified by the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue (BIR).
[9]
In their Answer,
[10]
 Spouses Dela Cruz 
admitted ownership of the subject properties to be expropriated and 
manifested support for the C-5 subject properties to be expropriated and
 manifested support for the C-5 Northern Link Road Project. However, 
while they conceded in the BIR's setting of the zonal value of the 
subject properties, they prayed that petitioner should pay them the fair
 market value instead of the zonal value considering that the subject 
properties "
are already situated in the industrial site apart 
from the fact that some nearby lots have been devoted to good business 
ventures such as construction of warehouses
."
[11]
Spouses Dela Cruz further 
alleged that the prevailing market value of similar properties within 
the same location ranges from P8,000.00 to P10,000.00 per square 
meter.
[12]
 Thus, 
they reserved their right to recover the fair market value of the 
subject properties before duly appointed commissioners pursuant to Rule 
67 of the Rules of Court.
[13]
On November 12, 2008, absent
 any objection to petitioner's right of eminent domain, the RTC issued 
the order of expropriation and writ of possession.
[14]
The deposit of 
P495,200.07 and transfer of possession of the subject properties were 
successfully made.
[15]
After ordering the 
expropriation of the subject properties, the RTC proceeded to the second
 stage of an action for expropriation, 
i.e.
, the 
determination of just compensation for the property sought to be taken. 
It then constituted a Board of Commissioners (BOC) for that 
purpose.
[16]
In the meantime, Spouses 
Dela Cruz were substituted by their heirs (respondents) as parties to 
the case after the deaths of Imelda and Luis on July 10, 2005 and July 
19, 2007, respectively.
[17]
On February 21, 2014, the 
BOC opined that the estimated value of the land was P15,000.00 per 
square meter.
[18]
 
It explained that it could no longer conduct an ocular inspection of the
 C-5 Northern Link Road Expressway, Valenzuela City because the project 
already commenced; thus it used other bases for appraising the subject 
properties.
[19]
 
The BOC explained:
Since we are no longer 
conducted [
sic
] an ocular inspection, we have 
considered the physical, functional and external value influences of the
 neighborhood, and have noted and considered an approach of value and 
analysis, taking into accounts [
sic
] the public use 
and the value of allowable damages or enhancements to any remaining 
property for determination of just compensation, if any. Also, taking 
into account other properties previously subject of expropriation within
 the immediate vicinity, which can be used as a precedent for this 
particular case.
[20]
The BOC further 
explained that in determining just compensation, it took into 
consideration the "sales comparison and cost approach" which is founded 
on the principle of substitution where the value of a property is 
indicative of the value of other similar properties.
[21]
 The BOC then based 
its appraisal on the following factors: (a) the highest and best use of 
the property in relation to the prevailing usage of the neighborhood and
 immediate use at the time of taking, 
i.e.
, mixed 
residential and industrial; (b) the BIR zonal valuation, 

i.e.
, P2,750.00 per square meter; (c) consequential 
benefits which the owner may derive from the remainder of the 
expropriated property; and (d) the analysis made in the Hobart case 
under Civil Case No. 15-V-08-an expropriation case involving properties 
within the same vicinity which was previously settled with finality and 
which was determined as the one most similar to the instant case because
 they involve properties near each other.
[22]
After the parties filed 
their respective Comments,
[23]
 the RTC rendered a 
Decision.
RTC 
Ruling
In the 
Decision
[24]
 dated
 September 18, 2014, the RTC ordered petitioner to pay Spouses Dela Cruz
 just compensation fixed at P9,000.00 per square meter, less the 
provisional deposit the petitioner previously made. The RTC also awarded
 in favor of Spouses Dela Cruz interest on the unpaid balance of just 
compensation at the rate of 12% 
per annum
 from the 
time of filing of the complaint until fully paid by petitioner.
[25]
The dispositive portion of 
the Decision provides:
WHEREFORE, Judgment is
 hereby rendered condemning the following lots of the 
defendants:

NO.

all
 located at Barangay Ugong, Valenzuela City, free from all liens and 
encumbrances whatsoever, for the construction of C-5 Northern Link Road 
Project Segment 8.1 from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to the North 
Luzon Expressway, Valenzuela City, a public purpose, in favor of the 
plaintiff, Republic of the Philippines, upon payment of just 
compensation which is fixed at Php9,000.00/square meter or in the total 
amount of Php9,000.00 (
sic
) (NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PESOS) (100 sq. m. x Php9,000.00) deducting the provisional deposit of 
P275,000.00 previously made and subject to the payment of all unpaid 
taxes and other relevant taxes by the defendants up to the filing of the
 complaint, if there be any.
The plaintiff is ordered
 to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the unpaid balance of 
just compensation of Php625,000.00 (SIX HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND) 
(Php900,000.00-Php275,000.00) computed from the time of the filing of 
the complaint until plaintiff fully pays the 
balance.
No additional amount for the improvement of 
lot covered by TCT No. 68373 is awarded as the court considers the 
amount of Php220,200.07 already paid by plaintiff to the defendants as 
enough just compensation for the improvement.
Let a 
certified true copy of this decision be forwarded to the Office of the 
Register of Deeds of Valenzuela City for the latter to annotate this 
decision in the Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. V-70921 (now 
V-94768); V-68375 (now V-97473); and V-68373 (now V-947772) of the 
Registry of Deeds of Valenzuela City.
SO 
ORDERED.
[26]
Aggrieved, 
petitioner, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), appealed 
the RTC Decision to the CA.
[27]
CA 
Ruling
In the 
Decision
[28]
 dated
 June 28, 2018, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the ruling of the 
RTC with modification only as to the payment of interest.
[29]
The CA first noted that the 
directive of the RTC for the government to deposit the amount equivalent
 to the zonal value of the subject properties and the value of the 
improvements therein before the Acting Branch Clerk of Court runs 
counter to Republic Act No. (RA) 8974.
[30]
 It explained that the Court, looking into the 
Senate deliberations, construed that the intent of RA 8974 was to 
supersede the system of deposit under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court with
 the scheme of immediate payment in cases involving national government 
infrastructure projects.
[31]
As to the determination of 
just compensation, the CA ruled that the RTC validly lowered the BOC's 
recommended market value of P15,000.00 to P9,000.00.
[32]
The CA refused to set the 
just compensation at P2,750.00 per square meter. It explained that zonal
 value could not be the lone basis for the determination of just 
compensation as it is only one of the factors which should be considered
 in computing just compensation under RA 8974.
[33]
The CA further 
ruled that courts are not strictly bound to mechanically follow each of 
the standards in Section 5 of RA 8974 as the factors have been held to 
be recommendatory in nature. Nevertheless, contrary to the OSG's claim, 
the RTC referred to several factors enumerated in RA 8974 for the 
assessment of the value of the land subject of expropriation 
proceedings. The CA specifically explained that based on the records, 
the RTC used the following relevant factors: (a) the BIR zonal 
valuation; (b) the value declared by Spouses Dela Cruz, as owners, in 
their Answer before the RTC; (c) the recommended value of the BOC which 
was ultimately based on the value of the Hobart property which is a land
 in the same general vicinity also expropriated for the similar purpose;
 and (d) evidence describing the location, shape, and classification of 
the subject properties. The CA further explained that while the RTC did 
not assign values based on the location, shape, and classification of 
the subject properties, the factors were nonetheless considered by both 
the BIR zonal value and the BOC recommended value.
[34]
In affirming the
 RTC's determination of just compensation of P9,000.00 per square meter,
 the CA emphasized the rule under Section 4, Rule 67 of the Rules of 
Court that just compensation should be based on the value of the 
property at the time of taking or filing of the complaint, whichever 
came first. As in the case, the CA found that both the zonal and the 
recommended values were pegged at, or near the time of the filing of the
 complaint for expropriation in 2007 which preceded the taking of the 
subject properties in 2008. The CA then considered the following: (1) 
the zonal value of P2,750.00 per square meter which was based on the 
schedule of zonal values issued by the Department of Finance in Order 
No. 22-2003 that was certified by the BIR as applicable for the year 
2007; and (2) the BOC recommended value of P15,000.00 per square meter 
based on the Hobart case that was decided wit finality in 2010. Applying
 by analogy the mode of computation by the Court in 
Evergreen 
Manufacturing Corp. v. Rep. of the Phils.
[35]
 (
Evergreen
), 
the CA ruled that the mean of the zonal value and the BOC recommended 
value will qualify as a full and fair equivalent of the subject 
properties. The CA then determined the mean of the two values at 
P8,875.00, which is approximately the same value determined by the RTC 
and within the range of the owner's declared value at P8,000.00 to 
P10,000.00.
[36]
Thus, the CA found 
petitioner liable to pay respondents the remaining balance of 
P625,000.00 as just compensation which shall earn interest at: (1) 12% 

per annum
 from the time of filing of the complaint 
until June 30, 2013; and(2) 6% 
per annum
 from July 1,
 2013 until full payment of the remaining balance, in accordance with 
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Circular No. 799.
[37]
The dispositive
 portion of the Decision provides:
WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the appeal of plaintiffÂ­-appellant Republic of the
 Philippines is DENIED.
The Decision dated September 
18, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, Branch 172, 
National Capital Judicial Region in Civil Case No. 248-V-07 is AFFIRMED 
with MODIFICATION on the payment of 
interest.
Plaintiff-Appellant Republic of the 
Philippines is ordered to pay interest at the rate of: (1) twelve 

per centum
 (12%) 
per annum
 on the 
unpaid balance of Six Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P625,000.00) 
from the date of filing of the instant complaint until June 30, 2013; 
and (2) six 
per centum
 (6%) 
per 
annum
 from July 1, 2013 until full payment of said unpaid 
balance.
SO ORDERED.
[38]
Petitioner filed a
 Motion for Reconsideration,
[39]
 but the CA denied it in its Resolution dated 
March 5, 2019.
[40]

 The CA ruled: (1) that the conduct of an ocular inspection is not 
mandatory before the BOC can make a recommendation as it is merely a 
factor to guide the commissioners in arriving at a just value for the 
expropriated property; (2) that the OSG is correct in stating that the 
BOC should not use the valuation awarded in previous expropriation cases
 considering the valuation awarded in previous expropnat1on cases 
considering the differences in the nature and condition of the 
properties involved; thus the RTC, for that reason, precisely reduced 
the BOC's recommended value, being well aware that there are other 
factors which affect the proper valuation of the expropriated properties
 other than the value of similarly situated properties; (3) that the 
alleged presence of informal settlers near or within the vicinity of the
 subject properties could not have reduced the RTC's determination of 
just compensation, 
i.e.
, P9,000.00 because of the 
fact that the area was also devoted to commercial and industrial uses; 
and (4) that zonal value cannot be the sole basis in determining just 
compensation, but the RTC nevertheless considered zonal value as one of 
the factors in determining the fair and full equivalent of the subject 
properties.
[41]
Hence, this Petition for 
Review on 

Certiorari
.
The
 Petition
Petitioner argues 
that: (1) the CA erred in affirming the RTCs determination of the just 
compensation award at P9,000.00 per square meter as it is excessive; (2)
 the CA Decision is not supported by applicable laws and jurisprudence; 
and (3) the CA Decision is contrary to the evidence presented.
[42]
Specifically, petitioner 
asserts that the CA accorded respect to the RTC Decision without due 
ascertainment of the requirements set forth under Section 5 of RA 8974. 
It maintains that the BIR zonal valuation is reflective of the fair 
market value of real properties within a given area; thus, given the 
significant process of arriving at the values indicated in the BIR Zonal
 valuation, it should not be taken lightly and it would be highly 
suspicious if the recommended just compensation is more than double the 
BIR valuation.
[43]
Petitioner further argues 
that the RTC did not take into consideration its evidence showing the 
actual use of the subject properties as undisputably residential and the
 classification, size, area, and condition of the subject property; that
 the BOC did not conduct an ocular inspection of the subject properties,
 thereby gravely limiting their knowledge on the actual use, 
classification, size, area, and condition of the subject property; and 
on the contrary, it was able to present witnesses who were able to 
accurately testify as to the actual condition of the properties, 

i.e.
, the depressed and substandard state of the area
 which was near or within the vicinity of the areas with colonies of 
informal settler families.
[44]
Petitioner furthermore 
maintains that the RTC purportedly erred in relying on the 
recommendation of the BOC considering that the latter's valuation took 
into consideration as one of its factors the value of the properties 
involved in the other expropriation cases; and that the value of the 
other properties may have appreciated through the years instead of its 
character and price at the time of taking.
[45]
In their Comment to the 
Petition,
[46]
 
respondents argue that the CA duly considered the factors enumerated in 
Section 5 of RA 8974 in determining the just compensation for the 
subject properties;
[47]
 that petitioner failed to present evidence that
 the subject properties are found in the location where the informal 
settlers are located;
[48]
 and that the appraisal of respondents' 
expropriated lots is not limited to the zonal value by the BIR, but also
 on the location, accessibility, selling prices of comparable 
properties, the amenities present, and other factors which were duly 
considered by the BOC and the RTC.
[49]
 However, they pray that because the petition is
 intended for delay, the just compensation for the subject properties 
should be valued at P15,000.00 per square meter.
[50]
Petitioner then 
manifested that it will no longer file a Reply as it had already 
exhaustively discussed all issues and arguments in support of its 
position.
[51]
The 
Issue
The main issue to be 
resolved in this case is whether the CA erred in affirming the just 
compensation award of the RTC at P9,000.00 per square 
meter.
The Court's 
Ruling
 
No modification of judgment can be granted 
to respondents who did not appeal the RTC Decision as affirmed by the 
CA.
 
At
 the outset, the Court cannot entertain respondents' contention and 
prayer in their Comment that the payment of just compensation should be 
increased from P9,000.00 to P15,000.00. This is consistent with the well
 settled procedural rule that no modification of judgment can be granted
 to a party who did not appeal.
[52]
 Without a doubt, respondents are seeking a 
modification not only of the CA Decision, but also of the RTC Decision 
without filing the proper appeal.
The Court explained
 in 
Yano v. Sanchez
:
[53]
The 
entrenched procedural rule in this jurisdiction is that a party who did 
not appeal cannot assign such errors as are designed to have the 
judgment modified. All that said appellee can do is to make a 
counter-assignment of errors or to argue on issues raised at the trial 
only for the purpose of sustaining the judgment in his favor, even on 
grounds not included in the decision of the court a quo or raised in the
 appellant's assignment of errors or 
arguments.
This tenet is enshrined as one 
of the basic principles in our rules of procedure, specifically to avoid
 ambiguity in the presentation of issues, facilitate the setting forth 
of arguments by the parties, and aid the court in making its 
determinations. 
A party who fails to acquire complete relief 
from a decision of the court has various remedies to correct an omission
 by the court. He may move for a correction or clarification of 
judgment, or even seek its modification through ordinary 
appeal.
 There is thus no basis for the Court to skip the rule 
and excuse herein respondents for failure to properly avail themselves 
of the remedies in the face of the parties' contentions that have 
remained disputed.
[54]
 (Italics 
supplied.)
Admittedly, the rule is subject 
to exceptions. However, the established exceptions to this rule such as 
"(1) errors affecting the lower court's jurisdiction over the subject 
matter, (2) plain errors not specified, and (3) clerical errors" are not
 present in the case.
[55]
Thus, in the absence of any 
of the exceptions which would warrant a relaxation of the rule, the 
Court cannot address respondent's prayer to increase the valuation of 
the subject properties to P15,000.00 per square 
meter.
The Court now resolves the petition. 
 
 
The Court affirms 
the award of just compensation for the taking of the subject properties 
valued at P9,000.00 per square 
meter.
 
The
 well settled rule is that only questions of law should be raised in a 
petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of 
the Rules of Court.
[56]
 The Court is not a trier of facts and it is not
 the Court's function to examine, review, or evaluate evidence all over 
again.
[57]
 Thus, 
as in expropriation cases, the Court may not delve into factual issues 
pertaining to the value of the property expropriated.
[58]
 Further, the factual 
findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are final and 
conclusive and cannot be reviewed by the Court.
[59]
While the Court 
has recognized exceptions
[60]
 to this rule, the Court finds none which would 
warrant the Court's deviation from the findings of fact of the RTC and 
the CA.
The Court finds that the only legal issues 
presented by petitioner are: (1) whether the RTC's determination of just
 compensation is in accordance with Section 5 of RA 8974; and (2) 
whether the RTC should have given weight to the BIR zonal value in 
determining just compensation.
[61]
The Court has defined just 
compensation in this wise:
Constitutionally, 
"just compensation" is the sum equivalent to the market value of the 
property, broadly described as the price fixed by the seller in open 
market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition,
 or the fair value of the property as between the one who receives and 
the one who desires to sell, it being fixed at the time of the actual 
taking by the government. Just compensation is defined as the full and 
fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the propriator. 
It has been repeatedly stressed by this Court that the true measure is 
not the taker's gain but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to 
modify the meaning of the word "compensation" to convey the idea that 
the equivalent to be given for the property to be taken shall be real, 
substantial, full and ample.
[62]
 (Emphasis 
omitted.)
Section 5 of RA 8974 provides for 
the standards that may be considered by the courts in determining just 
compensation, 

viz.
:
SECTION 5. 

Standards for the Assessment of the Value of the Land Subject 
of Expropriation Proceedings or Negotiated Sale
. - In order to
 facilitate the determination of just compensation, the court may 
consider, among other well-established factors, the following relevant 
standards:
 
(a)
The classification and use for
 which the property is suited;
(b)
The developmental costs for improving the 
land;
(c)
The value declared by the 
owners;
(d)
 
The current selling price of similar lands in the 
vicinity;
(e)
The reasonable disturbance compensation for the 
removal and/or demolition of certain improvement on the land and for the
 value of improvements thereon;
(f)
 
This size, shape or location, tax declaration and 
zonal valuation of the land;
(g)
The price of the land as manifested in the ocular 
findings, oral as well as documentary evidence presented; 
and
(h)
Such facts and events as to enable the affected 
property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly Â­situated 
lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government
 and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as 
possible.
It
 must be emphasized however that the determination of just compensation 
in eminent domain cases is a judicial function. As such, legislative 
enactments, as well as executive issuances, which fix or provide for the
 method of computing just compensation are tantamount to impermissible 
encroachment on judicial prerogatives.
[63]
 Hence, any valuation for just compensation 
provided in statutes may serve only as a guiding principle but may not 
supplant the court's own determination as to the amount that should be 
awarded and how to arrive at such amount.
[64]
Consistent with the 
aforesaid principle, the CA aptly discussed that the courts are not 
strictly bound to mechanically follow each of the standards enumerated 
in Section 5 of RA 8974 as the factors have been held to be merely 
recommendatory in nature.
[65]
Specifically, in 

Rep. of the Phils. v. Heirs of Sps. Pedro Bautista and 
Valentina Malabanan
,
[66]
 the Court ruled that the courts are not bound 
to consider the standards under Section 5 of RA 8974 considering the 
exact wording of the provision, 
i.e.
, "in order to 
facilitate the determination of just compensation, the courts may 
consider" them. The Court explained that the use of the word "may" in 
the provision is construed as permissive and operating to confer 
discretion.
[67]
Nevertheless, contrary to 
petitioner's assertion, and as aptly observed by the CA, the RTC 
considered the factors enumerated in Section 5 of RA 8974 in arriving at
 the just compensation to be paid to respondents. Notably, the RTC, 
while giving weight to the findings of the BOC, adjusted the latter's 
recommended valuation and lowered the amount from P15,000.00 per square 
meter to P9,000.00 per square meter.
The RTC's 
consideration of the factors in Section 5 of RA 8974 is evident in its 
Decision dated September 18, 2014, 
thus:
There is no dispute that the subject 
lots were classified as residential by the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR). The lots are located at Barangay Ugong, Valenzuela City. All the 
lots are irregular in shape. They are however, located in high intensity
 commercial zone. The place where the lots are located has amenities 
like water, electricity, transportation and communication. Per BIR zonal
 valuation, the lots have a zonal valuation of Php2,750.00 per square 
meter.
The subject property is 442.14 meters more or 
less away from the property (residential) of Hobart Realty Development 
Corporation, which was expropriated by the plaintiff and in which the 
just compensation was pegged by this court in the amount of 
Php15.000.00/sq.m. The Hobart property is located near Mindanao Avenue, 
Quezon City. The expropriation case involving Hobart Realty Development 
Corporation had long become final and executory. The property subject of
 expropriation is considered within high intensity commercial zone as it
 is located near the industrial and commercial zone in Valenzuela City 
were several business establishments and warehouses had increased 
considerably by virtue of its proximity to C-5 Road, North Luzon 
Expressway and Mindanao Ave., Quezon City.
Plaintiff 
tried to lower the value of the subject property by claiming that the 
subject property is near or within the vicinity of the areas with 
colonies of informal settlers, which were relocated. Plaintiff, however,
 failed to prove that the properties of the defendants were occupied by 
squatters or near the vicinity occupied by the alleged 
squatters.
x x x x
Taking the 
average [of] the BIR zonal valuation recommended as appearing in the 
complaint of P2,750.00 per square meter, the value declared by the 
defendants in their answer in the amount between 
Php8,000.00-Php10,000.00 per square meter, the recommendation of the 
Board of Commissioners and this court's observations on the location, 
the shape, the classification of the lots, the Court rules that the just
 compensation for the defendants' lots sought to be taken in this case 
is fixed at Php9,000.00 per square meter.
The 
construction of C-5 Northern Link Road Project, Segment 8.1 from 
Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to the North Luzon Expressway, Valenzuela
 City could not be said to have benefited the defendants for it is 
common knowledge that expressways are being fenced, so that inhabitants 
could not just cross over the highway to go to the other side or to 
utilize the said highway as pedestrian, as the highway was made 
precisely for the motoring public who has to pass through the toll 
gates. In short, defendants were actually isolated because of the fence 
made on the sides of the highways.
[68]
 (citations 
omitted)
Evidently, in pegging the just 
compensation that should be awarded to respondents at P9,000.00 per 
square meter, the RTC considered the following factors: (a) the BIR 
zonal valuation; (b) the value declared by Spouses Dela Cruz, as owners,
 in their Answer before the trial court; (c) the recommended value of 
the BOC which was ultimately based on the value of the Hobart property, a
 land in the same general vicinity also expropriated for the similar 
purpose;
[69]
 and 
(d) evidence describing the location, shape, and classification of the 
subject properties. Specifically, the RTC noted that the subject 
properties were irregular in shape and were classified as residential, 
but were located in a high-intensity commercial zone.
[70]
As
 to the absence of an ocular inspection, there is nothing anomalous in 
the process by which the BOC and subsequently, the RTC adjusted the 
BOC's recommendation and arrived at the full and fair equivalent of the 
subject properties. Ocular inspection is only one of the means in the 
ascertainment of just compensation. The BOC and the courts are not 
precluded from relying on other evidence to arrive at a full and fair 
value of the property subject of expropriation 
proceedings.
Further, it must be emphasized that RA 
8974, in relation to Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, creates a possible 
scenario wherein the government has already taken possession of the 
property 
and
 commenced works on it even before the 
commissioners were appointed and allowed to conduct an ocular inspection
 of the property sought to be taken. Specifically, under Section 
4
[71]
 of RA 8974, 
the court shall issue to the implementing agency of the government an 
order to take possession of the property and start the implementation of
 the project upon the filing of the complaint with due notice to the 
defendant and payment of 100% of the value of the property based on the 
current relevant BIR zonal valuation. At this stage, the government may 
already commence works on the property even if there is yet no 
appointment of commissioners under Section 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of 
Court.
Here, as explained by the BOC, they had no 
opportunity to inspect the subject properties considering that at the 
time of the appointment of the commissioners, the C-5 Northern Link Road
 Project, Segment 8.1 from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to the North 
Luzon Expressway Valenzuela City Project had already commenced. Thus, as
 already discussed, the BOC and thereafter, the RTC, considered other 
factors in determining the full and fair equivalent of the subject 
properties.
On the other hand, the issue of whether 
the subject properties are near, or within the vicinity of the areas 
occupied by informal settlers is factual in nature. Notably, petitioner 
explained that it presented evidence as to the actual condition of the 
subject properties and that it presented Ms. Fe Pesebere and Ms. Zenaida
 Galvez, both of the National Housing Authority (NHA) to prove that: (1)
 based on the NHA's census and tagging operations from November 2006 to 
January 2007, informal settlers were found in 
scattered 
areas
 of Brgy. Ugong and in concentrated areas in Brgy. Gen. 
T. de Leon; and (2) from November 29, 2007 to February 16, 2010, the NHA
 relocated all the informal settlers located in the areas affected by 
the C-5 Northern Link Road Project, Segment 8.1, including those found 
in Brgy. Ugong and Brgy. Gen. T. de Leon.
[72]
 However, this is not sufficient to 
contravene the RTC's finding that petitioner failed to prove its 
allegation that the subject properties were occupied or 

near
 the vicinity occupied by the alleged informal 
settlers. Nevertheless, the Court finds that petitioner failed to 
provide a compelling reason for the Court to deviate from the CA's 
conclusion that even if the alleged presence of informal settlers is 
factored in, it cannot reduce the RTC's recommended valuation. To 
reiterate, the CA considered that the area is also devoted to commercial
 and industrial uses. Notably, the valuation at P9,000.00 per square 
meter for the subject properties is substantially lower than the 
recommended value of the BOC at P15,000.00 per square 
meter.
Petitioner submits that the BIR zonal 
valuation reflects the fair market value of real property within a given
 area and must not be taken lightly given the tedious process by which 
the government determines it and that it is highly suspicious if the 
recommended just compensation is more than double the BIR 
valuation.
Petitioner's contention is without 
merit.
It is well settled in jurisprudence that the 
zonal valuation is just one of the indices of the fair market value of 
real estate.
[73]
 
It cannot be the sole basis of just compensation in expropriation cases 
since the standard is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss.
[74]
Also, the courts are not to 
be limited by a certain numerical threshold relative to the BIR zonal 
value in the determination of just compensation. Ultimately, in arriving
 at the full and fair equivalent of the property subject of 
expropriation, the courts are guided by certain standards for valuation 
such as those mentioned in Section 5 of RA 8974. Thus, the Court will 
sustain the lower courts determination of just compensation even if it 
is higher than, or more specifically, as in this case, double the BIR 
zonal value as long as such determination is justified as the full and 
fair equivalent of the property.
As in the case, the 
Court finds as reasonable the RTC's determination of just compensation 
that was affirmed by the CA. This is considering that as already 
discussed, the RTC referred to several factors in Section 5 of RA 8974 
in making such determination.  

 
The award of legal 
interest on just compensation must be modified such that legal interest 
must accrue from the time the Government took possession of the 
property.
 
The
 Court deems it proper to modify the award of interest by the CA. To 
recall, the CA modified the RTC's award of interest in favor of 
respondents and ordered petitioner to pay interest "at the rate of (1) 
twelve 
per centum
 (12%) 
per annum
 
on the unpaid balance of P625,000.00 from the date of filing of the 
instant complaint until June 30, 2013; and (2) six 
per 
centum
 (6%) 
per annum
 from July 1, 2013 
until full payment of said unpaid balance."
[75]
It must be 
emphasized that expropriation proceedings for national infrastructure 
projects are governed by Rule 67 of the Rules of Court and RA 
8974.
[76]
 
Particularly, Section 10, Rule 67 provides that the legal interest on 
the just compensation shall run from the time of taking of possession of
 the property. Section 10, Rule 67 
provides:
Section 10. 
Rights of 
plaintiff after judgment and payment
. - 
Upon payment 
by the plaintiff to the defendant of the compensation fixed by the 
judgment, with legal interest thereon from the taking of the possession 
of the property
, or after tender to him of the amount so fixed
 and payment of the costs, the plaintiff shall have the right to enter 
upon the property expropriated and to appropriate it for the public use 
or purpose defined in the judgment, or to retain it should he have taken
 immediate possession thereof under the provisions of section 2 hereof. 
If the defendant and his counsel absent themselves from the court, or 
decline to receive the amount tendered, the same shall be ordered to be 
deposited in court and such deposit shall have the same effect as actual
 payment thereof to the defendant or the person ultimately adjudged 
entitled thereto. (Italics supplied.)
In 

Evergreen
, the Court explained that just compensation
 should be made at the time of taking; and the rationale for imposing 
interest on just compensation is to compensate the property owners for 
the income that they would have made if they had been properly 
compensated, 
i.e.
, they had been paid the full amount
 of just compensation, at the time of taking when they were deprived of 
their property.
[77]
Thus, premised on the facts 
in 
Evergreen
, the Court ruled that while the just 
compensation shall be appraised as of the date of filing of the 
expropriation complaint as it preceded the actual taking of the 
property, the legal interest shall run from the time that the government
 took possession of the property and not from the time of filing of the 
expropriation complaint.
[78]
It also bears emphasis that 
the Court had already recognized that the just compensation due to the 
landowners for their expropriated property amounts to an effective 
forbearance.
[79]
 
Thus, pursuant to the Court's pronouncement in 
Eastern Shipping
 Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
,
[80]
 the imposable interest on the 
difference between the final amount adjudged by the Court and the 
initial payment made shall be 12% 
per annum
 from the 
time of taking of the property. However, consistent with the Court's 
ruling in 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.
,
[81]
 such interest rate 
shall apply only until June 30, 2013 in view of BSP Circular No. 799 
which took effect on July 1, 2013 and which reduced the legal interest 
on loans and forbearance of money from 12% to 6% 
per 
annum
. Thus, from July 1, 2013 onwards, the legal interest on 
the difference between the final amount adjudged by the Court and the 
initial payment made shall be 6% 
per annum
.
[82]
As
 in the case, the date of taking of the subject properties is November 
12, 2008 when the RTC issued a writ of possession in favor of 
petitioner.
[83]
 
Thus, a legal interest of 12% 
per annum
 on the 
difference between the final amount adjudged by the Court and the 
initial payment made shall accrue from November 12, 2008 until June 30, 
2013. From July 1, 2013 until the finality of the Decision of the Court,
 the difference between the final amount adjudged by the Court and the 
initial payment made shall earn interest at the rate of 6% 
per 
annum
. Thereafter, the total amount of just compensation shall
 earn legal interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from
 the finality of this Decision until full 
payment.
WHEREFORE
, the petition 
is 
DENIED
 The Decision dated June 28, 2018 and the 
Resolution dated March 5, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No.
 103874 are 
AFFIRMED
 with 

MODIFICATION
 only as to the reckoning period of the 
payment of legal interest.

 Philippines is ordered to pay interest at the rate of: (1) 12% 

per annum
 on the unpaid balance of P625,000.00 from

2013; and (2) 6% 
per annum
 from July 1, 2013 until 
full payment of the unpaid 
balance.

 Section 4 of Republic Act No. 8974 
provides:
SECTION 4. 
Guidelines for 
Expropriation Proceedings
. - Whenever it is necessary to 
acquire real property for the right-of-way or location for any national 
government infrastructure project through expropriation, the appropriate
 implementing agency shall initiate the expropriation proceedings before
 the proper court under the following 
guidelines:
(a) Upon the filing of the 
complaint, and after due notice to the defendant, the implementing 
agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property the amount 
equivalent to the sum of (1) one hundred percent (100%) of the value of 
the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau
 of Internal Revenue (BIR); and (2) the value of the improvements and/or
 structures as determined under Section 7 
hereof;
(b) In provinces, cities, 
municipalities and other areas where there is no zonal valuation, the 
BIR is hereby mandated within the period of sixty (60) days from the 
date of the expropriation case, to come up with a zonal valuation for 
said area; and
(c) In case the completion of a 
government infrastructure project is of utmost urgency and importance, 
and there is no existing valuation of the area concerned, the 
implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property its 
proffered value taking into consideration the standards prescribed in 
Section 5 hereof.
Upon compliance with the 
guidelines abovementioned, the court shall immediately issue to the 
implementing agency an order to take possession of the property and 
start the implementation of the 
project.
Before the court can issue a Writ 
of Possession, the implementing agency shall present to the court a 
certificate of availability of funds from the proper official 
concerned.
In the event that the owner of the 
property contests the implementing agency's proffered value, the court 
shall determine the just compensation to be paid the owner within sixty 
(60) days from the date of filing of the expropriation case. When the 
decision of the court becomes final and executory, the implementing 
agency shall pay the owner the difference between the amount already 
paid and the just compensation as determined by the court. (italics
