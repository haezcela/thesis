[ G.R. No. 200658, June 23, 2021 ]


SALVACION A. LAMADRID, PETITIONER, VS. CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED AND VIVIAN LO, RESPONDENTS.
DECISION




HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the September 16, 2011 Decision
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 114964, which reversed and set aside the February 24, 2010 Decision
[3]
 and the April 20, 2010 Resolution
[4]
 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 07-001814-09.



The appellate court found petitioner's dismissal from employment as 
valid and thus, dismissed her complaint for illegal dismissal lodged 
against respondents Cathay Pacific Airways Limited (Cathay) and Vivian 
Lo (Lo).


The Antecedents:



In 1990, Cathay hired Salvacion A. Lamadrid (Lamadrid) as a cabin crew. Cathay's Conditions of Service
[5]

 stipulated that all its cabin crew shall be based in Hong Kong. Prior 
to her termination in 2007, Lamadrid had rendered about 17 years of 
service in Cathay, and held the position of Senior Purser with a monthly
 salary of HK$26,613.00.
[6]
 Her duties as a flight attendant consisted as follows:








(a)


 [Providing] support to the In-flight Service Manager.














(b)


 Ensuring that in-flight information received 
during the Section leaders' briefing is fully conveyed to the Cabin Crew
 working in their assigned area.














(c)


 Ensuring that the service provided to 
passengers is carried out in accordance with the service plan and is 
consistent with the company service philosophy of Service Straight from 
the Heart.














(d)


 Ensuring that the Cabin Crew in their 
assigned area are competent in safety, security and service procedure 
since Senior Pursers are responsible for the performance and behavior of
 crew in their respective area.














(e) 


Ensuring that the In-flight Service Manager is
 informed of any crew or passenger related problems, irregularities, 
cabin defects, defective or missing equipment.
[7]






On May 19, 2007, Donald Lal (Lal), Airport Services Officer of Cathay in
 Sydney Airport, received a report from Customer Officer Mary Greiss 
(Mary) that some crew members of Cathay flight CX 139, including 
Lamadrid, were caught in possession of goods after alighting from the 
aircraft. Mary handed to Lal a plastic bag containing a 1.5 liter Evian 
water bottle and a pile of magazines confiscated from Lamadrid as well 
as the photocopy of the latter's passport. The confiscated items were 
turned over to Cindy Lowe (Lowe), the Airport Services Supervisor, who 
then finally surrendered the items to Brian Davis (Davis), Cathay's 
Airport Services Manager in Sydney Airport, after Lowe recorded the 
confiscated items on Lamadrid's passport.
[8]



On May 21, 2007, Lamadrid and a certain Yvette Tsang (Tsang) met with 
Davis and pleaded him not to report the incident to their Hong Kong 
office. They also mentioned their 17 years of service with Cathay. 
Davis, however, responded that a report was already relayed and the 
confiscated items had already been sent to Hongkong via flight CX 100.
[9]





 


In a letter
[10]
 dated May 22, 
2007, Cathay requested Lamadrid to submit a written explanation 
regarding the May 19, 2007 incident aboard flight CX 139 and to show 
cause why no disciplinary action should be imposed against her since 
removal of company property without authorization is considered a 
serious misconduct. On May 28, 2007, Lamadrid submitted her reply-letter
[11]

 denying the allegations against her. She claimed that the Hello 
magazine which was confiscated from her was not Cathay's property. As 
regards the other items, she claimed that another cabin crew already 
admitted having taken those items.



In another letter
[12]
 dated 
June 21, 2007, Cathay once again informed Lamadrid that it received 
reports that she was found to have taken a large bottle of Evian water 
and a pile of magazines during flight CX 139 on May 19, 2007. She was 
again requested to explain her side. Consequently, Lamadrid sent a 
reply-letter
[13]
 dated June 
23, 2007 clarifying that she brought and declared the bottle of Evian 
water as her own. She denied having committed serious misconduct, and 
demanded that the items taken from her be preserved following a fair and
 transparent investigation.





On July 10, 2007, Cathay informed Lamadrid of the termination of her 
services effective immediately for committing serious misconduct by 
removing company property without authorization.
[14]

 According to Cathay, it could no longer repose its trust and confidence
 on petitioner considering the seriousness of her violation.



Hence, Lamadrid instituted a complaint for illegal dismissal and money claims against Cathay and Lo.



In her Position Paper,
[15]
 
Lamadrid insisted that her termination was without just cause because 
she bought the Evian water from Hong Kong. Granting that she took the 
bottle, the act was not prohibited by Cathay. She also contended that 
the penalty of termination was too harsh considering her 17 years of 
service and her clean record. Lamadrid prayed for reinstatement, payment
 of backwages, damages and attorney's fees.





In their Position Paper,
[16]
 
Cathay and Lo initially asserted that the Labor Arbiter had no 
jurisdiction to hear the dispute since the incident occurred in a 
foreign jurisdiction involving foreign nationals. Also, they maintained 
that Lamadrid had no cause of action against them because they complied 
with the requirements of substantive and procedural due process in labor
 cases. They further insisted that petitioner's position was imbued with
 trust and confidence, and her violation justified the termination of 
her services on the basis of loss of trust and confidence.




Ruling of the Labor Arbiter:



In a Decision
[17]
 dated April 
29, 2009, the Arbiter ruled that it has jurisdiction over the case since
 Cathay, even if a foreign corporation, is licensed and is actually 
doing business in the Philippines. Moreover, the employment contract 
between Lamadrid and Cathay was executed in the Philippines as well. It 
was also resolved that Lamadrid could not be considered a managerial 
employee based on her duties and responsibilities. Thus, there was no 
sufficient basis for the airline to terminate the worker's employment on
 the ground of loss of trust or confidence. It was also emphasized that 
the employee's outright dismissal was too harsh a penalty in view of her
 untarnished service record of 17 years. Finally, the Arbiter deemed it 
proper that separation pay be awarded in lieu of reinstatement in view 
of the parties' strained relations.



The 
fallo
 of the Decision reads in this wise:


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered declaring respondents guilty of illegal dismissal.



Respondent CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED is hereby ordered to pay 
complainant, as per attached computation from Computation and 
Examination Unit of this office.



All other claims herein sought and prayed for are hereby denied for lack of legal and factual bases.



SO ORDERED.
[18]



Both Lamadrid and Cathay elevated the case to the NLRC by filing their 
Partial Appeal Memorandum and Memorandum of Appeal, respectively.



Lamadrid argued that there was no showing of strained relationship 
between her and Cathay, and that she was entitled to damages since her 
termination was attended with bad faith.
[19]

 On the other hand, respondents maintained that the Arbiter had no 
jurisdiction over the case. They argued that the Arbiter erred in ruling
 that Lamadrid was not a managerial employee and in finding that the 
termination was a harsh penalty. They alleged that the amount received 
by Lamadrid in the course of her separation should have been taken into 
consideration.
[20]






Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission:


 






In its Decision
[21]
 dated 
February 24, 2010, the NLRC sustained the jurisdiction of the Labor 
Arbiter over the case. It anchored its ruling on Section 10 of the 
Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 or Republic Act No. 
8042 (RA 8042). It declared that the Arbiter has jurisdiction over 
claims arising from employer-employee relationship of Overseas Filipino 
Workers (OFW) deployed abroad. Lamadrid never became a permanent 
resident of Hong Kong.
[22]
 The
 NLRC likewise did not give credence to Cathay's position that 
Lamadrid's employment did not pass through any Philippine placement 
agency. Hence, as she was an OFW based in Hong Kong at the time, the 
Arbiter properly took cognizance of her complaint.


The NLRC concurred as well with the arbiter that the penalty of 
dismissal was too harsh considering the worker's untarnished record of 
17 years, the value of property stolen, and Cathay's failure to 
establish that Lamadrid was holding a managerial or a position of trust.
[23]




Finding no strained relations between Lamadrid and her employer, the 
NLRC ruled for the reinstatement of Lamadrid to her previous position as
 Senior Purser instead of payment of separation pay.
[24]

 Lastly, it held that Lamadrid is not entitled to damages since there 
was no showing of bad faith on the part of the respondents. However, the
 benefits and bonuses she received during her separation amounting to 
HK$622,077.54 should be deducted from the final monetary award that 
would be given to her.
[25]


The decretal portion of the NLRC's Decision reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision is AFFIRMED with modification as follows:


(1) Respondent CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED is ordered to immediately 
reinstate complainant Salvacion Lamadrid to her former position without 
loss of seniority rights within ten (10) days from receipt hereof; and



(2) Respondent CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS LIMITED is ordered to pay 
complainant Sa1vacion Lamadrid the amount of Six Thousand Six Hundred 
Seventy[-]Five and 41/100 Hong Kong Dollars, or its Peso equivalent at 
the time of payment, plus ten percent (10%) thereof as attorney's fees.


SO ORDERED.
[26]



Cathay's Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in its Resolution
[27]
 dated April 20, 2010. Thus, Cathay filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
 (With Urgent Application for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction)
[28]
 before the CA raising the following issues, to wit:


I.

PUBLIC RESPONDENT NLRC ACTED WITHOUT JURISDICTION. UNDER REPUBLIC ACT 
8042[.] THE NLRC HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER LABOR CLAIMS BY OVERSEAS 
WORKERS WHO ARE PERMANENT RESIDENTS OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY.


II.

PUBLIC RESPONDENT NLRC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO 
LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DISMISSED THE APPEAL FILED BY 
CATHAY. PRIVATE RESPONDENT LAMADRID WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF ILLEGAL 
DISMISSAL. THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT FAILED TO CONSIDER PETITIONER CATHAY'S 
EVIDENCE IN THE PROCEEDINGS A QUO, WHICH WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT:


1.) LAMADRID'S PILFERAGE AND SUBSEQUENT UNTRUSTWORTHY 
BEHAVIOR WERE PROVEN BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. THUS, PETITIONER CATHAY 
WAS WELL WITHIN ITS RIGHTS WHEN IT DECIDED TO TERMINATE HER EMPLOYMENT.


2.) HER JOB DESCRIPTION, DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES CLEARLY SHOW THAT 
SHE WAS AT LEAST A CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEE, WHOSE POSITION WAS VESTED WITH
 TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. SHE WAS NOT A MERE RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEE.


3.) CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACT SHE PERPETRATED, PILFERAGE, IS INHERENTLY 
PUNISHABLE AND REPREHENSIBLE REGARDLESS OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR 
THE LENGTH OF SERVICE OF THE EMPLOYEE.


4.) THE DIRECTIVE TO REINSTATE LAMADRID TO HER FORMER POSITION IS NOT 
JUSTIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES 
IS SO STRAINED AS TO FORECLOSE REINSTATEMENT. THE NLRC HAD ABSOLUTELY NO
 BASIS FOR REVERSING THE LABOR ARBITER'S FINDING OF STRAINED RELATIONS.
[29]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:



In its September 16, 2011 Decision,
[30]
 the appellate court granted Cathay's petition and dismissed the illegal dismissal complaint filed against it.



The appellate court sustained the jurisdiction of both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC in hearing the case based on Article 217 
[224]
 of the Labor Code of the Philippines,
[31]
 Section 10 of RA 8042,
[32]
 and the Omnibus Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 8042.
[33]


As regards the issue of illegal dismissal, the appellate court ruled 
that the airline validly terminated the employment of Lamadrid on 
grounds of theft and dishonesty. Regardless of the value of the property
 pilfered, Cathay had the right to dismiss erring employees as a measure
 of protection against actions inimical to its interest.
[34]



The dispositive portion of the appellate court's Decision reads:


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is 
hereby rendered by us REVERSING and SETTING ASIDE the Decision dated 
February 24, 2010 and the Resolution dated April 20, 2010 issued by the 
Seventh Division of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC 
No. 07-001814-09. Consequently, the Decision of Labor Arbiter Lutricia 
F. Quitevis-Alconcel on April 29, 2009 in NLRC NCR Case No. 03-04048-08 
is likewise REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Complaint filed by 
the private respondent Salvacion Lamadrid against herein petitioner for 
illegal dismissal is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.



SO ORDERED.
[35]








 



The appellate court denied Lamadrid's Motion for Reconsideration in a Resolution
[36]
 dated February 17, 2012.


Issue



Thus, Lamadrid brought the case before Us via this Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[37]
 on the sole ground that -


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN REVERSING THE 
DECISIONS OF BOTH THE LABOR ARBITER AND THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 
COMMISSION (NLRC) FINDING THE PETITIONER TO HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY 
DISMISSED.
[38]


Otherwise stated, the principal issue before Us is whether or not Lamadrid was illegally dismissed.


Contentions of the petitioner:


Lamadrid argues that Cathay failed to substantiate its allegation that 
she committed pilferage of company property. She claims that there was 
no proof that flight attendants are prohibited from bringing water 
during long-haul flights. The burden of proving theft of company 
property rests with Cathay, and the same should be proven by clear and 
convincing evidence. Petitioner also emphasizes that Cathay deviated 
from procedural due process because she was denied the opportunity to 
confront or refute the evidence against her.
[39]


Also, loss of trust or confidence as ground for dismissal applies only 
to managerial employees or those employees charged with the care and 
custody of employer's money or property. Lamadrid insists that her 
position as a Senior Purser is not a position imbued with trust and 
confidence.
[40]


Arguments of the respondents:


Respondents, in their Comment,
[41]

 counter that Lamadrid already attained a permanent residency status in 
Hong Kong on the strength of the Affirmation of Virginia Ho Mi Han 
(Virginia) dated September 9, 2008.
[42]

 Moreover, she was entrusted with and had custody of company properties 
in her assigned section in the aircraft such as chinaware, glassware, 
cutlery, champagne, wine, amenity kits, and in-flight reading materials,
 among others. These company properties were under her exclusive control
 and safekeeping. Cathay stressed that its Uniform Disciplinary and 
Grievance Policy disclosed that removal of company property may be meted
 with the penalty of summary dismissal.
[43]



Furthermore, respondents maintain that they discharged their burden of 
proof and the termination was supported by substantial evidence pointing
 to the employee's pilferage of company property and dishonesty which 
eroded Cathay's trust and confidence reposed on her.
[44]

 The bottle of Evian water could not have been bought from Hong Kong as 
the production code showed that it was part of those exclusively 
distributed to Cathay.
[45]
 
Virginia's Affirmation belied Lamadrid's protestation that Tsang already
 admitted to have taken the enumerated items indicated in the letters 
addressed to Lamadrid. In fact, Tsang, in her conversation with 
Lamadrid, did not itemize the things she admitted to have taken.
[46]



Respondents insist that Lamadrid was afforded due process.
[47]

 Based on the Affirmation of Ip Tak Chau (Kevin), Lamadrid was routinely
 in-charge of company properties in-flight and supervises two to four 
cabin crew whose performances are under her appraisal rating for 
promotion purposes. This points to her position as one impressed with 
trust and confidence; that her employment was chiefly based on Cathay's 
continuing confidence in her, and once tainted, the reason for her 
employment ceased to exist. In fine, they posit that based on Lamadrid's
 commission of serious misconduct, the company lost its trust and 
confidence leading to her termination.
[48]



Incidentally, respondents aver that despite Lamadrid's abuse of their 
trust and confidence, she was still paid her full retirement benefits 
and long service payment which amounted to HK$622,077.50.
[49]


Our Ruling



The Petition is impressed with merit.



We sustain both the Labor Arbiter's and the NLRC's jurisdiction over the
 illegal dismissal case of Lamadrid. Article 224 [217] of the Labor Code
 provides that the Labor Arbiter has original and exclusive jurisdiction
 to hear and decide termination disputes involving all workers. This 
provision must be read together with Section 10 of RA 8042 as amended by
 RA 10022,
[50]
 as well as Section 3 of RA 10022.
[51]


SECTION 2. Section 3, paragraph (a) of Republic Act No. 8042, as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:


(a) "Overseas Filipino worker" refers to a person who is to be engaged, 
is engaged or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a state of 
which he or she is not a citizen or on board a vessel navigating the 
foreign seas other than a government ship used for military or 
non-commercial purposes or on an installation located offshore or on the
 high seas; to be used interchangeably with migrant worker.


Under the foregoing definition, Lamadrid is considered an Overseas 
Filipino Worker (OFW). She had been engaged in a remunerated activity in
 a state where she is not a citizen. Cathay's cabin crew are all based 
in Hong Kong, and in fact Lamadrid resided and leased an apartment in 
Hong Kong during her stint with Cathay. As an OFW faced with a 
termination dispute, Lamadrid's case may be heard and decided by the 
Arbiter under Article 224 [217] of the Labor Code in relation to RA 8042
 as amended by RA 10022.






Lamadrid's position as a Senior Purser is imbued with trust and confidence.


 







Jurisprudence classify positions of trust and confidence into two 
categories. The first consists of those managerial employees or those 
"vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and execute management 
policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, 
assign or discipline employees" as defined under Article 219 [212] (m) 
of the Labor Code.
[52]
 By the 
nature of their position, managerial employees are expected to exhibit 
utmost fidelity to the employer as they are entrusted with confidential 
and sensitive matters.
[53]
 The
 second category involves those who in the normal and routine exercise 
of their functions regularly handle significant amounts of the 
employer's money or property, such as but not limited to cashiers, 
auditors, and property custodians.
[54]




 
Based on the Affirmation
[55]
 
of Kevin, the Cabin Crew Line Manager of Cathay, the nature of 
Lamadrid's duties and obligations required the highest degree of trust 
and confidence because she had in her control properties of Cathay. The 
Affirmation specifically demonstrates in detail, 
viz
.:


12. In the management of the section of aircraft she 
[Lamadrid] is responsible for, she is basically unsupervised as she is 
empowered by the ISM to assist by overseeing the service and ensuring 
the Company's property is protected that no items of Company property 
are removed from the aircraft without authorization. She has custody of 
various company properties in her section of aircraft such as all 
service equipment including chinaware, glassware, cutlery and linenware,
 expensive items of Champagne, wine and liquor, amenity kits for 
passenger and inflight reading materials for passengers such as 
newspaper and magazines. There are long intervals of time inflight 
during which these company properties are under her exclusive 
safekeeping and control.


13. Sally's position and duties required that the company have the highest degree of trust and confidence in her.
[56]



Taking this Affirmation into consideration, together with the declared duties and responsibilities of a flight attendant,
[57]

 We hold that indeed the nature of Lamadrid's position was imbued with 
trust and confidence. She had in her custody and control company 
properties which are of significant value, and she also had the 
responsibility of informing the In-flight Service Manager whether there 
was defective or missing equipment. Moreover, she had oversight over two
 to four cabin crew members assigned in her section of the aircraft and 
rated their performance for promotion purposes.
[58]

 She had been entrusted with the custody and control of valuable company
 properties in the normal and routine exercise of her duties.






Lamadrid's termination was not commensurate to the infraction committed.


 






 
Employees can be terminated only for just or authorized cause.
[59]
 Article 297 [282] of the Labor Code enumerates the just causes for dismissal, to wit:


ARTICLE 297. [282] 
Termination by Employer
. - An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:


(a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the 
lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his 
work;


(b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;


(c) Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;




 




(d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person 
of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly 
authorized representatives; and


(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing. (Emphasis Supplied)



There is loss of trust and confidence when an employee fraudulently and 
willfully committed acts or omission in breach of the trust reposed in 
her/him by the employer. Two requisites must be complied with to justify
 this ground for termination. First, the employee must be holding a 
position of trust, and second, the employer shall sufficiently establish
 the employee's act that would justify loss of trust and confidence. The
 act must be characterized as real wherein the facts that brought about 
such act were clearly established, and that the employee committed the 
same without any justifiable reason.
[60]



Cathay has complied with the two aforementioned requisites for loss of 
trust and confidence. We have already settled that Lamadrid's position 
was imbued with trust and confidence. Likewise, the airline clearly 
demonstrated that she committed an infraction of company policy that 
breached its trust and confidence on her.



Pilferage of company property is an act characterized by fraud or 
dishonesty which may be meted with summary dismissal as specifically 
provided in Cathay's 
Disciplinary & Grievance Policy
,
[61]
 
viz
.:


9.4 Examples of misconduct in which a Cabin Crew member may be summarily dismissed include, but not limited to, the following:


x x x x


x x x x


* 
Is found guilty of fraud or dishonesty, e.g. removing Company property
,
 selling travel benefit for advantage, intentionally divulging 
confidential information or personal data, forged medical certificate, 
illegal amendment of medical certificate.
[62]
 (Emphasis Supplied)


Cathay attached a confirmation from Danone Imported Water Asia that the 
batch number of the Evian water confiscated from Lamadrid belonged to 
the batch of Evian water that was exclusively shipped to Cathay.
[63]

 This certainly established that the bottle of water confiscated from 
her was Cathay's property. Admittedly, Lamadrid transgressed Cathay's 
Disciplinary and Grievance Policy by taking out the bottle of water 
without authorization.




 




Lamadrid's infraction was clearly a case of misconduct considering that 
it is "a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a
 forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies
 wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment."
[64]
 It evidently eroded Cathay's trust and confidence in her.



However, while the weight of evidence points to Lamadrid's infraction of
 company policy, We should also consider that this is Lamadrid's first 
infraction in her 17 years of service in the airline which involved a 
mere bottle of water. Concededly, the company laid down the penalties 
for violation of its policies; however, the evaluation of an employee's 
infraction should be dealt with fairness and reason. Simply put, all 
surrounding circumstances must be considered and the penalty must be 
commensurate to the violation committed by an employee. Termination of 
the services of an employee should be the employer's last resort 
especially when other disciplinary actions may be imposed, considering 
the employee's long years of service in the company, devoting time, 
effort and invaluable service in line with the employer's goals and 
mission, as in Lamadrid's case. Thus, We emphasize the principle of 
totality of infractions, 
viz
.:


x x x . It is here that totality of infractions may be 
considered to determine the imposable sanction for her current 
infraction. In 
Merin v. National Labor Relations Commission
, the Court explained the principle of "totality of infractions" in this wise:


The totality of infractions or the number of violations committed during
 the period of employment shall be considered in determining the penalty
 to be imposed upon an erring employee. x x x.
[65]
 (Citation Omitted)



During Lamadrid's span of employment, she did not commit any infraction 
or was ever sanctioned except in the incident subject of the present 
controversy. To impose a penalty as grave as dismissal for a first 
offense and considering the value of the property allegedly taken would 
be too harsh under the circumstances. Therefore, Lamadrid was illegally 
dismissed from service.



In the recent case of 
Foodbev International v. Ferrer
,
[66]
 We held that:


x x x A less severe penalty of suspension should have been 
imposed considering that the respondents have been in the service for 
several years. The Court also observes that this is the first time in 
the long years of service that respondents failed to follow the cleaning
 procedure. Thus, a more compassionate penalty of suspension is deemed 
appropriate.





 



In 
Philippine Long Distance Company v. Teves
, the Court 
stressed that while it is the prerogative of the management to 
discipline its employees, it should not be indiscriminate in imposing 
the ultimate penalty of dismissal as it not only affects the employee 
concerned, but also those who depend on his livelihood.


While management has the prerogative to discipline its 
employees and to impose appropriate penalties on erring workers, 
pursuant to company 
rules
 and regulations, however, such 
management prerogatives must be exercised in good faith for the 
advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of 
defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special 
laws and valid agreements. 
The Court is wont to reiterate that while 
an employer has its own interest to protect, and pursuant thereto, it 
may terminate an employee for a just cause, such prerogative to dismiss 
or lay off an employee must be exercised without abuse of discretion.

 Its implementation should be tempered with compassion and 
understanding. The employer should bear in mind that, in the execution 
of said prerogative, what is at stake is not only the employee's 
position, but his very livelihood, his very breadbasket.


Dismissal is the ultimate penalty that can be meted to an employee. 
Even where a worker has committed an infraction, a penalty less punitive
 may suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not to 
be visited with a consequence so severe.
 This is not only the laws 
concern for the workingman. There is, in addition, his or her family to 
consider. Unemployment brings untold hardships and sorrows upon those 
dependent on the wage-earner. (Emphases in the original; citations 
omitted)


As consequences of Lamadrid's illegal dismissal, she is entitled to the 
payment of full backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement 
since the latter is no longer feasible considering the time that has 
lapsed and the strained relations between the parties.
