ZALAMEDA, J.:


Before the Court is a petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated 19 June 2012 and Resolution
[3]
 31 July 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 107977, which affirmed the Order
[4]

  dated 15 August 2008 of the Secretary of respondent Department of 
Agrarian Reform (DAR). In its Order dated 15 August 2008, DAR partially 
revoked a previous Order
[5]
 
issued on 04 September 1975 which converted twenty-three (23) parcels of
 agricultural land into land suitable for residential, commercial, 
industrial and other urban purposes.

Antecedents


Central Azucarera de Tarlac, the predecessor-in-interest of 
petitioner CAT Realty Corporation (CAT Realty), filed a petition for 
conversion of 23 parcels of agricultural land, with an aggregate area of
 386.7992 hectares, located in Bayambang, Pangasinan (subject property).
 After conducting an investigation of the parcels of land, then DAR 
Secretary Conrado Estrella (Sec. Estrella) issued the Order dated 04 
September 1975 (Conversion Order), granting the conversion and declaring
 the subject property as land suitable for residential, commercial, 
industrial, and other urban purposes.
[6]

The Order, in part, read:


In view of the foregoing, and considering the parcels of 
land subject hereof to be suitable for residential, commercial, 
industrial or for other urban purposes as found and recommended by the 
Agrarian Reform Team, the Agrarian Reform District Office and the 
Department of Local Government and Community Development, and 
considering also, that the tenant-farmers, the occupant-tillers and/or 
squatters in the subject land are amenable to the conversion as herein 
stated and the petitioner is likewise in conformity to their terms and 
conditions as afore-stated, the request of the petitioner is hereby 
given due course and the parcels of land subject hereof are hereby 
declared suitable for residential, commercial, industrial or other urban
 purposes, subject however, to the provisions of R.A. No. 3844:as 
amended by R.A. No. 6389, P.D. 316, P.D. 553 and G.R. No. 53.


Moreover, so as not to create any conflict and/or misunderstanding in
 . the future between the herein petitioner and the alleged tenants, 
occupant-tillers and squatters or occupants in the residential portions 
of the property, the following conditions are hereby incorporated as 
part of this Order: 


That the petitioner shall pay the bonafide tenants the disturbance compensation provided for by law;
 


That the bonafide tenants, occupant-tillers and/or squatters 
shall continuously worked on the untenanted landholdings until such time
 that the herein petitioner-owner shall developed and/or convert such 
areas to non-agricultural or agro-urban purposes;



That in addition to the payment of the disturbance compensation
 to the bonafide tenants, the herein petitioner-owner shall likewise 
allocate to the said tenants including however, the 
occupant-tillers-squatters a homelot of not less than 300 square meters 
which will be sold to them at minimum cost which homelots shall be 
within the residential portions of the subject property or in portions 
thereof which will not be affected by the urban or agro-urban 
development of the whole property to be determined by the 
petitioner-owner; and



That the displaced tenants, occupant-tillers or squatters or 
their sons shall be given the priority of employment in any 
agro-industrial project which the petitioner, the Central Azucarera de 
Tarlac, may established in the land in question.


So Ordered.
[7]


On 15 December 2004, respondents Center for Agrarian Reform 
Empowerment & Transformation, Inc. (CARET), Alternative CommunityÂ­ 
Centered Organization for Rural Development (ACCORD), Benjamin C. De 
Vera, Jr., and Tenario Garcia (private respopdents) filed a petition for
 revocation of the Conversion Order. According to private respondents, 
the conversion of the subject property should be revoked on the 
following grounds: (1) CAT Realty and its predecessor-in-interest failed
 to develop the subject property and (2) the same remains agricultural 
in use.
[8]
 Thereafter, Â·then 
DAR Secretary Nasser Pangandaman (Sec. Pangandaman) issued an Order 
dated 02 August 2006 partially revoking the Conversion Order and 
directing the municipal agrarian reform officer to proceed with the 
acquisition of the portions of the subject property that were still 
agriculturally viable under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program 
(CARP), 
viz
:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition for 
Revocation of the Conversion Order dated 04 September 1975 issued by 
then DAR Secretary Conrado Estrella involving the twenty three (23) 
parcels of land with an aggregate area of 386.7992 hectares located in 
Bayambang, Pangasinan is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED as to the areas which 
are undeveloped. Accordingly, the Conversion Order dated 04 September 
1975 is hereby PARTIALLY REVOKED.


The Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer and the Provincial Agrarian 
Refonn Officer concerned are hereby DIRECTED to immediately pmceed with 
the acquisition of subject properties which are still agriculturally 
viable under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.


SO ORDERED.
[9]
 [Emphases removed]


According to the Sec. Pangandaman, there was failure to comply with the conditions set by the Conversion Order.
[10]

 In particular, CAT Realty failed to convert and develop portions of the
 subject property, noting that the same still remained agricultural in 
nature.
[11]


CAT Realty moved for reconsideration of the partial revocation order.
 DAR granted the motion and reinstated the Conversion Order in an Order
[12]
 dated 11 October 2006:


WHEREFORE premises considered, the Motion for 
Reconsideration filed by the CAT Realty is hereby GRANTED. The Order 
dated 02 August 2006 partially revoking the Order dated 04 September 
1975 issued by former DAR Secretary Conrado Estrella is hereby SET 
ASIDE. The Order dated 04 September 1975 issued by former DAR Secretary 
Conrado Estrella is hereby AFFIRMED IN TOTO.


SO ORDERED.
[13]


DAR found that CAT Realty was able to comply with the condition to 
pay disturbance compensation by giving the tenants a subdivision. It 
also found there was no specific period within which CAT Realty had to 
develop the subject property. Moreover, DAR held that private 
respondents slept on their rights and were estopped from questioning the
 non-development of the subject property.
[14]


Consequently, private respondents moved for reconsideration. Sec. 
Pangandaman again reconsidered and reinstated the partial revocation of 
the Conversion Order. In his Order15 dated 06 September 2007, Sec. 
Pangandaman disposed:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Motion for 
Reconsideration dated 06 November 2006, from the Order dated 11 October 
2006, filed by CARET and ACCORD, represented by Ms. Beth Cagmayo, Mr. 
Benjamin C. de Vera, and Mr. Tenario Garcia, et al., involving twenty 
three (23) parcels of land owned by the Central Azucarrera de Tarlac 
(CAT), with an aggregate area of 386.7992 hectares located in Barangay 
Bayambang, Pangasinan, is hereby GRANTED and the Order dated 02 August 
2006, is hereby AFFIRMED 
in toto
.


SO ORDERED.
[16]


Sec. Pangandaman reiterated that CAT Realty did not substantially 
carry out its purpose to convert the land to commercial, industrial and 
residential uses.
[17]


CAT Realty again sought reconsideration but the same was denied by Sec. Pangandaman in an Order
[18]

 dated 15 August 2008. He ruled that majority of the subject property 
was still agricultural and no substantial development was introduced by 
petitioner.
[19]
 The dispositive portion of said Order reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, Motion for 
Reconsideration and/or Supplemental Opposition and Manifestation dated 
24 September 2007, from the Order dated 06 September 2007, filed by 
Central Azucarrera de Tarlac Realty Corporation through its Counsel, 
Dominic G. Mendoza, involving twenty three (23) parcels of. land owned 
by the Central Azucarrera de Tarlac (CAT), with an aggregate area of 
386.7992 hectares located in Barangay Bayambang, Pangasinan, is hereby 
DENIED. The Order dated 02 August 2006 and the Order dated 06 September 
2007 are hereby. FIR.MED IN TOTO.


SO ORDERED.
[20]


Aggrieved, CAT Realty filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court before the CA.
[21]


Ruling of the CA


The CA denied CAT Realty's petition in tlie assailed Decision
[22]
 dated 19 June 2012, the dispositive portion of which provides:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is 
hereby DENIED. The August 15, 2008 Order of the Secretary of the public 
respondent Department of Agrarian Reform is AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
[23]


The CA accorded respect and finality to the DAR's factual fmdings 
that there was no substantial development on the subject property, 
noting that the same was still used for agricultural purposes. Thus, 
there was nonÂ­ compliance with the Conversion Order.
[24]
 CAT Realty moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion through the assailed Resolution dated 31 July 2013.
[25]


Hence, the petition for review on 
certiorari
.


Issue


CAT Realty raised the sole issue of whether the CA erred in 
sustaining the DAR's partial revocation of the Conversion Order, 
effectively allowing DAR to put the undeveloped areas of the subject 
property under the coverage of agrarian reform.
[26]


Ruling of the Court


We find merit in the petition.


In 
Hacienda Luisita, Inc. v. Presidential Agrarian Reform Council
,
[27]

 the Court had occasion to discuss the legislative history of agrarian 
reform in the Philippines, beginning from the 1935 Constitution until 
the effectivity of Republic Act (RA) No. 6577, or the Comprehensive 
Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), on 15 June 1988: 


Land reform, or the broader term _"agrarian reform," has 
been a government policy even before the Commonwealth era. In fact, at 
the onset of the A merican regime, initial steps toward land reform were
 already taken to address social unrest. Then, under the 1935 
Constitution, specific provisions on social justice and expropriation of
 landed estates for distribution to tenants as a solution to land 
ownership and tenancy issues were incorporated.


In 1955, the Land Reforrn Act (Republic Act No. [RA..] 1400) was 
passed, setting in motion the expropriation of all tenanted estates.


On August 8, 1963, the Agricultural Land Reform Code (RA 3844) was 
enacted, abolishing share tenancy and converting all instances of share 
tenancy into leasehold tenancy. RA 3844 created the Land Bank of the 
Philippines (LBP) to provide support in all phases of agrarian reform.


As its major thrust, RA 3844 aimed to create a system of 
ownerÂ­cultivatorship in 1ice and corn, supposedly to be accomplished by 
expropriating lands in excess of 75 hectares for their eventual resale 
to tenants. The law, however, had this restricting feature: its 
operations were confined mainly to areas in Central Luzon, and its 
implementation at any level of intensity limited to the pilot project in
 Nueva Ecija.


 Subsequently, Congress passed the Code of Agrarian Reform (RA 6389) 
declaring the entire country a land reform area, and providing for the 
automatic conversion of tenancy to leasehold tenancy in all areas. From 
75 hectares, the retention limit was cut down to seven hectares.


Barely a month after declaring martial law in September 1972, then 
President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27) for
 the "emancipation of the tiller from the bondage of the soil." Based on
 this issuance, tenant-farmers, depending on the size of the landholding
 worked on, can either purchase the land they tilled or shift from share
 to fixed-rent leasehold tenancy. While touted as "revolutionary," the 
scope of the agrarian reform program PD 27 enunciated covered only 
tenanted, privately-owned rice and corn lands.


Then came the revolutionary government of then President Corazon C. 
Aquino and the drafting and eventual ratification of the 1987 
Constitution. Its provisions foreshadowed the establishment of a legal 
framework for the formulation of an expansive approach to land reform, 
affecting all agricultural lands and covering both tenant-fanners and 
regular farmworkers.


So it was that Proclamation No. 131, Series of 1987, was issued 
instituting a comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) to cover all 
agriculturallands, regardless of tenurial arrangement and comniodity 
produced, as provided in the Constitution.


On July 22, 1987, Executive Order No. 229 (EO 229) was issued 
providing, as its title indicates, the mechanisms for CARP 
implementation.


It created the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) as the 
highest policy-making body that formulates all policies, rules, and 
regulations necessary Jfor the implementation of CARP.


 On June 15, 1988, RA 6657 or the 
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988
,
 also known as CARL orÂ·Â· the CARP Law, took effect, ushering in a new 
process of land classification, acquisition, and distribution.
[28]


Notably, the Conversion Order dated 04 September 1975 of then DAR 
Sec. Estrella declaring the subject property "suitable for residential, 
commercial, industrial or other urban purposes"
[29]
 was issued pursuant to the prevailing law during that time, which was RA 3844,
[30]
 as amended by RA63 89.
[31]
 The department head's authority to declare the suitable purpose of landholdings was provided under Section 36(1) thereof:


(1) The landholding is declared by the department head upon 
recommendation of the National Planning Commission to be suited for 
residential, commercial, industrial or some other urban purposes: 
Provided, That the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to disturbance 
compensation equivalent to five times the average of the gross harvests 
on his landholding during the last five preceding calendar years (2)


As discussed hereafter, . the Court upholds the Order dated 04 
September 1975 considering that: (1) the Conversion Order has long 
attained finality; thus, parties are now estopped from questioning the 
final and executory conversion order, (2) CAT Realty and its 
predecessor-in-interest complied with the conditions stated under the 
conversion order; as such, there was noÂ· sufficient ground to cause its 
partial revocation, and (3) the subject property cannot be subject to 
agrarian reform since the same was already declared suitable for 
non-agricultural use prior to. the effectivity of RA 6657 on 15 June 
1988. 


The Order dated 04 September 1975,

declaring the conversion of the subject

property as suitable for nonÂ­

agricultural purposes, has long

attained finality.


At the outset, the Court notes that the Conversion Order dated 04 September 1975 had already attained finality.


 In 
Berboso v. Court ofAppeals
,
[32]

 the Court decreed that once final and executory, an order for land 
conversion can no longer be questioned. Significantly, Berborso also 
involved a similar conversion order issued by Sec. Estrella in 1975, 
which was sought to be cancelled only in 1992 or seventeen (17) years 
after its issuance. The Court ruled that the parties were already barred
 from questioning the final and executory conversion order, 
viz
:


x x x It was only on 9 December 1992, or after 17 years 
from the issuance of the 22 January 1975 Conversion Order that they 
questioned the validity of the said Conversion Order when they filed a 
Petition with the Office of the DAR Secretary for the cancellation of 
the same. By then, the period for petitioners Berbosos to question the 
Conversion Order had long since expired. Hence, they are now barred from
 assailing the said Order under the doctrine of estoppel. Estoppel by 
laches arises from the negligence or omission to assert a right within a
 reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to 
assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it. Once final and 
executory, the Conversion Order can no longer be questioned.
[33]


Indubitably, the conversion order of the DAR was a final order, 
because it res.olved the issue of whether the subject property may be 
converted to non-agricultural use. Once final and executory, the 
conversion order can no longer be questioned. It can no1onger be 
modified or reversed. Parties carmot assail said order without running 
afoul of the doctrine of estoppel.
[34]


Further, Section 46 Article VIII of the 2002 Comprehensive Rules on 
Land Use Conversion provides that a petition for revocation must be 
filed within ninety (90) days from discovery of the facts which warrant 
the revocation or Withdrawal, but not more that one (1) year from 
issuance of the Conversion Order.
[35]


Clearly, private respondents failed to file the petition for 
revocation within the 90-day period. Likewise, more than one (1) year 
had already lapsed since issuance of the Conversion Order in 1975. At 
any rate, private respondents cannot assert that they belatedly 
discovered the facts to warrant revocation only in 2004. Since private 
respondents claimed to be the legitimate tenants who have long been 
occupying the subject property,
[36]

 they cannot simply feign ignorance of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the subject property just for the purpose of circumventing 
the 90-day prescriptive period.


 In this case, it is undisputed that private respondents or their 
predecessors-in-interest failed to question the Conversion Order 
immediately or soon after its issuance. Aside from the petition for 
revocation filed only on 15 December 2004, they did not avail of any 
remedy to assail the Conversion Order. Applying 
Berboso
, the 
Conversion Order has long become final and executory and thus, can no 
longer be questioned, modified, or reversed. Considering it took them 
almost thirty (30) years to assail said order, private respondents are 
barred by estoppel from seeking its revocation.


CAT Realty complied with the

conditions under the Conversion

Order
 


Even assuming that private respondents may still question the 
conversion order, CAT Realty has already sufficiently complied with the 
conditions stated therein. Hence, there was no valid cause for its 
revocation.


 To reiterate, the Conversion Order was issued pursuant to RA 3844, 
as amended by RA 6389. Prior to its amendment, Section 36(1) of R.A. No.
 3844 originally specified a period for conversion by the landholder:


SEC. 36. 
Possession of Landholding; Exceptions
.- 
Notwithstanding any agreement as to the period or future surrender, of 
the land, an agricultural lessee shall continue in the enjoyment and 
possession of his landholding except when his dispossession has been 
authorized by the Court in a judgment that is final and executory if 
after due hearing it is shown that:


 (1) The agricultural lessor-owner or a member of his immediate 
family will personally cultivate the landholding or will convert the 
landholding, if suitably located, into residential, factory, hospital or
 school site or other useful non-agricultural purposes: Provided; That 
the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to di turbance compensation 
equivalent to five years rental on his landholding in addition to his 
rights under Sections twenty-five and thirty-four, except when the land 
owned and leased by the agricultural lessor, is not more than five 
hectares, in which case instead of disturbance compensation tbe lessee 
may be entitled to an advanced notice of at least one agricultural year 
before ejectment proceedings are filed against him: 
Provided, 
further, That sh uld the landholder not cultivate the land himself for 
three years or fail to substantially carry out such conversion within 
one year after the dispossession of the tenant, it shall be presumed 
that he acted in bad faith and the tenant shall have the right to demand
 possession of the land and recover damages for any loss incurred by him
 because of said dispossessions
. (Emphasis supplied.)


However, the above-quoted provision of RA 3844 was later amended by RA 6389 on 10 September 197l, to read:


SEC. 36. 
Possession of Landholding; Exceptions.
 
-Notwithstanding any agreement as to the period or future surrender, of 
the land, an agricultural lessee shall continue in the enjoyment and 
possession of his landholding except when his dispossession has been 
authorized by the Court in a judgment that is final and executory if 
after due hearing it is shown that:


(1) The landholding is declared by the department head upon 
recommendation of the National Planning Commission to be suited for 
residential, commercial, industrial or some other urban purposes: 
Provided, That the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to disturbance 
compensation equivalent to five times the average of the gross harvests 
on his landholding during the last five preceding calendar years;


Significantly, the condition imposed on the landowner to implement 
the conversion of the agricultural land to non-agricultural purposes 
within a certain period was deleted in RA 6389. With the enactment of 
the amendatory law, the remedy left available to the tenant is to claim 
disturbance corripensation.
[37]
 The same conditions are explicitly found under the terms ofthe Conversion Order, to wit:


x x x the following conditions are hereby incorporated as part of this Order:


1. That the 
petitioner shall pay the bonafide tenants the disturbance compensation provided for by law
;


 2. That the 
bonafide tenants, occupant-tillers and/or squatters 
shall continuously "worked on the untenanted landholdings until such 
time that the herein petitioner-owner shall developed and/or convert 
such areas to non-agricultural or agro-urban purposes
;


3. That in addition to the payment of the disturbance compensation to
 the bonafide tenants, the herein petitioner-owner shall likewise 
allocate to the said tenants including however. the 
occupant-tillers-squatters a homelot of not less than 300 square meters 
which will be sold to them at minimum cost which homelots shall be 
within the residential portions of the subject property or in portions 
thereof which will not be affected by the urban or agro-urban 
development of the whole property to be determined by the 
petitioner-owner; and


4. That the displaced tenants, occupant-tillers or squatters or their
 sons shall be given the priority of employment in any agro-industrial 
project which the petitioner, the Central Azucarera de Tarlac,- may 
established in the land in question.
[38]
 (Emphasis supplied.)


Thus, under the prevailing law at the time, i.e., RA 6389, there was 
no requirement for the landowner to develop the subject property within a
 certain period. The only requisite under the law was payment of 
disturbance compensation. In this case, through the Order dated 11 
October 2006, then DAR Sec. Pangandarnan recognized there was indeed 
payment of disturbance compensation:


Records would show that the case was filed pursuant to 
the provisions of Section 36 (1) of Republic Act No. 3844 as amended by 
Section 7 of RA 6389. Under said rule, it was explicit that the only 
condition that the landowner has to comply with is to pay disturbance 
compensation as mentioned in the Order dated 04 September 1975. Such 
compliance by the applicant was mentioned in the Ocular Inspection 
Report that a Tenant's subdivision was given to the tenants thus, 
applicant is deemed to have complied with the sole condition provided 
for in the questioned Order.


As to the issue raised by the Petitioners that five (5) years have 
lapsed, yet the landowner failed to fully develop the subject property, 
the same cannot be used against herein applicant since the Order itself 
does no mention a period within which to develop the property.
[39]


The foregoing findings were never disturbed in the subsequent 
issuances of Sec. Pangandarnan. In revoking the Conversion Order, the 
Secretary merely reiterated that majority of the subject property was 
still agricultural and that no substantial development was introduced by
 CAT Realty.
[40]
 However, the 
Court cannot countenance the subsequent revocation because, aside from 
being final and executory, the conditions provided under the Conversion 
Order were sufficiently fulfilled by CAT Realty. Pursuant to RA 6389, 
the disturbance compensation was already paid to the bonafide tenants of
 the subject property.


Likewise, the Conversion Order itself does not specify a period for 
the full and complete development of the subject property. The 
conversion order simply states the tenants shall be allowed to 
"continuously wor[k] on the untenanted landholdings until such time that
 the herein petitioner-owner shall develo[p]and/or convert such areas to
 non-agricultural or agro-urban purposes."
[41]
 Again, even the DAR Secretary recognized there was partial development made on one-third (1/3) of the subject property.
[42]
 Among the improvements introduced in the subject property were:


1. A two (2) hectare portion of the subject property has 
been allotted and approved by the Municipal Government of Bayarnbang to 
be the relocation of its site;


 2. A conunercial district surrounding the new local government site is already planned;


3. The Palm Core Realty and Development, Inc. has transformed twelve (12) hectares of and into the Hands of Haven Memorial Park;


 4. Ground has already been broken for the construction of the Northern Plains High End Subdivision;


5. The Central Pangasinan Electric Corporation or CENPELCO . has established a power plant inthe propertY is question;


6. Petitioner also built two (2) residential subdivisions;


7. The expansion of municipal cemetery has also been set aside;


 8. Petitioner also donated the site of the Bayarnbang Water District and the Bani Elementary School;


9. Petitioner has constructed four (4) Tenant Subdivisions.
[43]


Applying the express conditions of the Conversion Order, the 
unfinished development of the subject property means that tenants may 
still continue to work on undeveloped portions of the subject property. 
Clearly, CAT Realty cannot be deemed as non-compliant with the 
conditions of the Conversion Order because the order itself, as well as 
the prevailing law at the time of its issuance, did not set a period 
within which the owner should completely develop the subject property.


The subject property cannot be subject

to agrarian reform since the same was

already declared suitable for non-

agricultural use prior to the effectivity

of RA 6657 on 15 June 1988


When the DAR Secretary partially revoked the Conversion Order, he 
likewise erred in directing the agrarian reform officer to proceed with 
the acquisition of the portions of the subject property that are still 
agriculturally viable under the CARP.


 In 
Hermosa v. Court of Appeals
,
[44]

 the Court ruled that lands not devoted to agricultural activity and 
those that were previously converted to non-agricultural uses are 
outside the coverage of the CARL.
[45]

 For lands converted prior to 15 June 1988 or the date when CARL took 
effect, DAR is bound by such conversion. It was therefore error to 
include the undeveloped portions of subject property within the coverage
 of the CARL.
[46]
 Moreover, 
the CARL does not specify which specific government agency should have 
done the reclassification. To be exempt from CARP, all that is needed is
 one valid reclassification of the land from agricultural to 
non-agricultural by a duly authorized government agency before the 
effectivity of the CARL on 15 June 1988.
[47]
 


Further, in 
Kasamaka-Canlubang, Inc. -v. Laguna Estate Development Corp.
,
[48]

 lands already classified as commercial, industrial, or residential 
before 15 June 1988, are outside the coverage of the CARL. 
Significantly, 
Kasamaka-Canlubang
, inc. involved similar factual circumstances and antecedents to the case at bar.


In 
Kasamaka-Canlubang, Inc.
, petitioner therein also sought 
the revocation of a conversion order issued on 04 June 1979 by Sec. 
Estrella. A petition for revocation was filed on 04 July 2004, or around
 twenty-five (25) years after conversion. Similarly, said 1979 
conversion order was also partially revoked by Sec. Pangandaman on 25 
September 2006. However, the partial revocation was reversed upon appeal
 to the Office of the President (OP). The OP likewise declared the 
parcels of land exempt from the coverage of CARP. Consequently, the OP 
reinstated Sec. Estrella's conversion order dated 04 June 1979. 
Thereafter, theCA affirmed the OP's ruling. Eventually, a petition under
 Rule 45 was filed before the Court; the Court then upheld the uniform 
decisions of the CA and OP in the following manner: 


In view of the foregoing, this Court had, in multiple 
occasions, ruled that lands already classified as commercial, industrial
 or residential before the effectivity of the CARL, or June 15, 1988, 
are outside the coverage thereof. In 
Natalia Realty, Inc. v. Department of Agrarian Reform,

 for instance, we held that the DAR committed grave abuse of discretion 
when it placed undeveloped portions of land intended for residential use
 under the ambit of the CARL. Similarly, in 
Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
, we nullified the decision of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (
DARAB
)
 declaring the land in dispute as agricultural and, thus, within the 
coverage of the CARL, when the same had already been reclassified as 
residential by several government agencies prior to the effectivity of 
the law. We likewise held in 
Junio v. Garilao
 that properties 
identified as zonal areas not for agricultural use prior on June 15, 
1988 are exempted from CARL coverage, even without confirmation or 
clearance from the DAR.
[49]


Applying these doctrines, it cannot be denied that the subject 
property is likewise beyond the coverage of the CARL. The subject 
property has long been declared suitable for residential, commercial, 
industrial, and other urban purposes under the Conversion Order dated 04
 September 1975. The subject property was converted long before 15 June 
1988, or before effectivity of the CARL. Furthermore, the Conversion 
Order had already attained finality and its conditions were duly 
complied with. Thus, the DAR is bound by such conversion.
[50]
 It bears repeating that once final and executory, a conversion order can no longer be questioned.
