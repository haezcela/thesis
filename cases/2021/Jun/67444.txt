[6]






Prosecution's Version



SPO2 Noel Antillon, Jr. (SPO2 Antillon, Jr.), SPO2 Ernesto Sanchez (SPO2
 Sanchez), PO3 Vergelio Del Rosario (PO3 Del Rosario), PO2 Elmar Manuel 
(PO2 Manuel), members of the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Task Force, 
Taguig City, and Forensic Chemist P/Chief Inspector Abraham Tecson (P/CI
 Tecson) testified for the prosecution. Their testimonies may be 
summarized, in this wise:



On July 28, 2010, a confidential informant reported to their office 
about illegal drug activities on Camachile Street, Western Bicutan, 
Taguig City. Police Chief Major Porfirio Calagan briefed SPO2 Sanchez, 
PO1 Balbin,
[7]
 PO3 Brion,
[8]

 and SPO2 Antillon, Jr. on a buy-bust operation to be launched in the 
target area. SPO2 Antillon, Jr. was assigned as poseur buyer while the 
rest, as back-up members. He was also handed ten (10) pieces of P100.00 
bills as buy-bust money.
[9]










After coordinating with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), 
the buy-bust team proceeded to the target area. There, SPO2 Antillon, 
Jr. and the confidential informant saw Garbo in front of her house. The 
confidential informant greeted her and introduced SPO2 Antillon, Jr. as 
someone who wanted to buy 
shabu
. The confidential informant then 
asked Garbo where Andanar was. She said that Andanar was fetching 
something and then invited them inside her house to wait. Inside the 
house, they met Gutierrez, who was also waiting for Andanar.
[10]





After about thirty (30) minutes, Andanar arrived. He asked SPO2 Antillon, Jr. how much 
shabu

 he wanted to buy. The latter answered P1,000.00 worth. Since he only 
had two (2) plastic sachets with him, Andanar agreed to sell P500 worth 
of 
shabu
 to SPO2 Antillon, Jr. while the other, to Gutierrez. 
SPO2 Antillon, Jr. handed the P500.00 buy-bust money to Andanar while 
the latter, in turn, gave him a plastic sachet with white crystalline 
substance. Garbo told SPO2 Antillon, Jr. that he could already use the 
drug for an additional P20.00. He declined, saying he had his own pipe 
in the car.
[11]



Since SPO2 Antillon, Jr. was inside Garbo's house, he could not signal 
the other team members that the sale had been consummated. Thus, he 
instructed the confidential informant to go outside and signal the team.
 When the rest of the team arrived, SPO2 Antillon, Jr. arrested Andanar 
while SPO2 Sanchez arrested Garbo and Gutierrez. SPO2 Antillon, Jr. 
frisked Andanar and recovered from the latter the buy-bust money. He 
also frisked Gutierrez and recovered an aluminum foil and a lighter.
[12]



The team brought appellants and Gutierrez to the police station where 
the marking, inventory, and photographing were done. The team had to 
leave the 
situs criminis
 because a crowd had already gathered around.
[13]



SPO2 Antillon, Jr. handed the seized items to the case investigator PO3 
Vergelio Del Rosario (PO3 Del Rosario) who prepared the following 
documents: affidavit of arrest, inventory report, spot report, booking 
sheets, and request for laboratory examination.
[14]
 SPO2 Antillon, Jr. and PO3 Del Rosario brought the specimen to the crime laboratory where it was received by PO2 Manuel.
[15]



Both the defense and the prosecution stipulated on the qualifications of
 Forensic Chemist P/CI Tecson and the fact that he received subject 
specimens which he tested and found positive for methamphetamine 
hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. They also stipulated that he reduced 
his findings in Physical Science Report No. D-260-105, stating thus:


x x x x

One (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet with markings "NOA-1-280710" containing 0.07 gram of white crystalline substance.

[O]ne (1) aluminum foil strip with markings "NOA-2-280710" containing white crystalline substance.

[O]ne (1) rolled aluminum foil with markings "NOA-3-280710" containing residue.

x x x x
[16]




Finally, the parties stipulate that P/CI Tecson had no personal knowledge of the source of the drugs.


Defense's Version



Garbo testified that on July 28, 2010, she was watching a game near her 
house on Camachile Street, Western Bicutan, Taguig City when SPO2 
Antillon, Jr. suddenly approached her, placed his arm around her, and 
told her to walk with him quietly towards a vehicle. She was made to 
board the vehicle and brought to the police station where she saw 
Andanar and Gutierrez. She admitted that she met Andanar once before, 
but not Gutierrez.
[17]



On the other hand, Andanar testified that on the day in question, he was
 at home sleeping. Three (3) men wearing civilian clothes suddenly 
barged in, introduced themselves as police officers, and asked him to 
bring out the supposed illegal drugs he was hiding. They also searched 
his house but they did not find any illegal drugs. He was placed in 
handcuffs and brought to the police station. There, he saw Garbo and 
Gutierrez.
[18]


The Ruling of the Regional Trial Court



By Decision
[19]
 dated May 19, 2016, the trial court found appellants guilty as charged, thus:


WHEREFORE
, in the premises, the accused 
MICHAEL ANDANAR
 is hereby found 
GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT

 of selling without any authority 0.07 gram of Methylamphetamine 
Hydrochloride or "shabu", a dangerous drug in violation of Sec. 5, 1
st
 par., Article II of R.A. 9165 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a FINE of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (PHP500,000.00)
 for Criminal Case Nos. 17220-D and 17221-D; and 
MARY JANE GARBO
 is hereby found 
GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT
 of Violation of Section 6 of Article II of R.A. 9165 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
TWELVE (12) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY OF IMPRISONMENT
 and a fine of 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (PHP100,000.00)
 in Criminal Case No. 17222-D.




x x x x


SO ORDERED.
[20]




The trial court gave full credence to the testimonies of the prosecution
 witnesses who were police officers performing their official functions.
 The trial court found the chain of custody to have been duly 
established and, thus, rejected appellants' denial and theory of frame 
up.
[21]


The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals



On appeal, appellants faulted the trial court for rendering the verdict 
of conviction allegedly despite 1) the prosecution's failure to prove 
the elements of illegal sale of drugs and illegal maintenance of a drug 
den and 2) the alleged procedural omissions during the buy-bust 
operation: a) the absence of any insulating witnesses during the 
inventory and photographing of the seized items; b) the fact that the 
inventory and photographing were done at the police station, not at the 
place of arrest; and, c) the prosecution's failure to present the 
testimony of the person who received the confiscated 
shabu
 from the crime laboratory.
[22]


For its part, the People, through the Office of the Solicitor General 
(OSG), countered, in the main: 1) the elements of illegal sale of drugs 
and illegal maintenance of den were all proven; 2) there was substantial
 compliance with the chain of custody rule. Besides, the parties 
stipulated on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, thus, the 
defense had impliedly admitted that there was no break in the chain of 
custody; 3) the presumption of regularity in the performance of the 
police officers' official functions prevails over appellants' bare 
denial and theory of frame up.
[23]


The Ruling of the Court of Appeals



In its assailed Decision
[24]
 dated June 23, 2017, the Court of Appeals affirmed.


The Present Appeal



Appellants now seek affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for
 their acquittal. For the purpose of this appeal, the OSG
[25]
 and appellants
[26]
 both manifested that in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs in the Court of Appeals.


Core Issue



Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial court's verdict of 
conviction against Andanar for illegal sale of dangerous drugs and Garbo
 for illegal maintenance of drug den, respectively?


Ruling


Sale of dangerous drugs



Andanar was charged with illegal sale of dangerous drugs allegedly 
committed on July 28, 2010. The governing law is RA 9165, before its 
amendment in 2014.



Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 reads:


Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, 
and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, 
Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia
 and/or Laboratory Equipment. - The PDEA shall take charge and have 
custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, 
controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as 
instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, 
seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following 
manner:


(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the 
drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically 
inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the 
person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her
 representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall 
be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy 
thereof; x x x




Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002, 
implementing the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, defines 
"chain of custody," as follows:


"Chain of Custody" means the duly recorded authorized 
movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant 
sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from 
the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory 
to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction. Such record of 
movements and custody of the seized item shall include the identity and 
signature of the person who held temporary custody of seized item, the 
date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course of 
safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.




In illegal drugs cases, the drug itself constitutes the 
corpus delicti

 of the offense. The prosecution is, therefore, tasked to establish that
 the substance illegally sold by the accused is the same substance 
eventually presented in court.
[27]



To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody: 
first
, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; 
second
, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; 
third
, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and 
fourth
, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.
[28]



Here, the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody. Consider:


One
, the venue for making the inventory and photograph was not 
properly complied with. Section 21(a) of the Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (IRR) requires that the inventory and photograph be 
conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation, thus, it must be 
done at the place of the arrest.
[29]



Here, SPO2 Antillon, Jr. testified that upon appellants' arrest, they 
were immediately brought to the police station where an inventory and 
photographing of the seized items were conducted. He explained, however,
 that a crowd had already gathered at the 
situs criminis
, thus, they had to go back to the police station.



In 
People v. Dumanjug
,
[30]

 the Court rejected the buy-bust team's argument that it failed to 
conduct the marking, inventory, photography of the seized drug 
immediately at the place of arrest because a crowd of two hundred (200) 
people have gathered creating a dangerous environment. Indeed, bare 
invocation of inconvenience does not translate to compliance with the 
chain of custody rule.


Two
, the physical inventory and photography were not done in the 
presence of a Department of Justice (DOJ) representative, a media 
representative, and a local elected official.




People v. Lim
[31]

 stressed the importance of the presence of the three (3) insulating 
witnesses or in the alternative, the prosecution must allege and prove 
the reasons for their absence and show that earnest efforts were made to
 secure their attendance. The Court ratiocinated:


It must be alleged and proved that the presence of the three
 witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug 
seized was not obtained due to reason/s such as:


(1) their attendance was impossible because the place of 
arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and 
photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate 
retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in 
his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the
 punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure
 the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public 
official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised 
Penal Code prove[d] futile through no fault of the arresting officers, 
who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) 
time constraints and urgency of the antiÂ­ drug operations, which often 
rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from 
obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the 
offenders could escape.



Earnest effort to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses must be proven. 
People v. Ramos
 teaches:


It is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not 
per se
 render the confiscated items inadmissible. However, a justifiable reason for such failure or a 
showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses
 under Section 21 of RA 9165 must be adduced. In 
People v. Umipang
, the Court held that the prosecution must show that 
earnest efforts

 were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the 
law for "a sheer statement that representatives were unavailable without
 so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to 
look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to be 
regarded as a flimsy excuse." Verily, mere statements of unavailability,
 absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are 
unacceptable as justified grounds for noncompliance. These 
considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily 
given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the
 information about the activities of the accused until the time of his 
arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the 
necessary arrangements beforehand knowing full well that they would have
 to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21 of 
RA 9165. As such, police officers are compelled not only to [the] state 
reasons for their non-compliance, but must in fact, also convince the 
Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated 
procedure, and that under the given circumstances, their actions were 
reasonable.
[32]




Here, while the prosecution admitted that marking, inventory, and 
photographing were not made in the presence of a DOJ representative, a 
media representative, and a local elected official, it made no effort, 
at all, to explain or justify why these required witnesses were absent 
nor did it show that earnest efforts were exerted to secure their 
attendance.


Three
, what happened to the confiscated drugs after SPO2 
Antillon, Jr. and PO3 Del Rosario delivered them to the crime 
laboratory? The prosecution was conspicuously silent on this point.



We note that a certain PO2 Manuel received the specimen from PO3 Del 
Rosario. There was, however, a break in the chain of custody of the 
seized drug because PO2 Manuel who handled the specimen was not 
presented as witness.



In 
People v. Burdeos
,
[33]

 the prosecution failed to show how the specimen was handled while under
 the custody of the officer who received it and how the same was 
subsequently turned over to the forensic chemist who conducted the 
examination. The Court, thus, declared that such glaring gap in the 
chain of custody tainted the integrity of the 
corpus delicti
.


Four
, there was nothing in the records regarding the custody of 
the seized drug from the time it was turned over to the laboratory up to
 its presentation in court.




In 
People v. Baltazar
,
[34]

 the accused was acquitted of illegal sale of dangerous drugs because 
the records were bereft of any evidence as to how the illegal drugs were
 brought to court. There was no showing how the alleged seized item was 
stored after it was examined by the forensic chemist, who handled the 
specimen after examination, and where the same was kept until it was 
retrieved and presented in court.






 



Notably, the parties agreed to dispense with the testimony of Forensic 
Chemist P/CI Tecson and instead stipulated that he was a qualified 
forensic chemist and that he had no personal knowledge about the source 
of the drug items but only conducted laboratory examination thereon. 
People v. Miranda
[35]
 citing 
People v. Cabuhay
[36]
 ordained that the stipulation to dispense with the testimony of the forensic chemist should include:


(1) that the forensic chemist received the seized article as
 marked, properly sealed, and intact; (2) that he resealed it after 
examination of the content; and (3) that he placed his own marking on 
the same to ensure that it could not be tampered with pending trial.
[37]





Here, the stipulation to dispense with the testimony of the Forensic 
Chemist P/CI Tecson did not contain the vital pieces of information 
required, 
i.e.
, he received the seized drugs as marked, properly 
sealed, and intact; he resealed the drug items after examination of the 
content; and, he placed his own marking on the drug items. Absent any 
testimony regarding the management, storage, and preservation of the 
illegal drug allegedly seized herein after its qualitative examination, 
the fourth link in the chain of custody of the said illegal drug could 
not be reasonably established.
[38]





In light of the prosecution's failure to establish with moral certainty 
the identity and the unbroken chain of custody of the dangerous drugs 
seized from Andanar, a verdict of acquittal here is in order.
[39]


Maintenance of a drug den



For Garbo's part, she was charged with illegal maintenance of a drug den
 under Section 6 of RA 9165. The offense requires the following 
elements: a) that the place is a den - a place where any dangerous drug 
and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical is administered, 
delivered, stored for illegal purposes, distributed, sold, or used in 
any form; and b) that the accused maintains the said place. It is not 
enough that dangerous drugs or drug paraphernalias were found in the 
place. More than a finding that the dangerous drug is being used there, 
it must also be clearly shown that the accused is the maintainer or 
operator or the owner of the place where the dangerous drug is used or 
sold.
[40]





Here, the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Garbo is maintaining a drug den. Consider:


First
, a drug den is a lair or hideaway where prohibited or 
regulated drugs are used in any form or are found. Its existence may be 
proved not only by direct evidence but may also be established by proof 
of facts and circumstances, including evidence of the general reputation
 of the house, or its general reputation among police officers.
[41]


People v. Galicia
[42]
 ordained that the prosecution must establish that the alleged drug den is a place where dangerous drugs are 
regularly

 sold to and/or used by customers of the maintainer of the den. The word
 "regular" means doing the same thing in uniform intervals, or something
 that is a common occurrence.



Here, PO2 Antillon, Jr. testified that Garbo invited him inside her 
house where the sale of illegal drugs between him and Andanar took 
place. Thereafter, Garbo offered PO2 Antillon, Jr. that he could already
 use the drug he just bought for an additional fee of P20.00. If at all,
 this only proves an isolated illegal drug transaction involving SPO2 
Antillon, Jr., Andanar, and Garbo. There was nothing on record, however,
 showing that Garbo's house was frequently used as a drug den. Neither 
did the prosecution prove that Garbo's house had a general reputation as
 such. Surely, the prosecution had only presented a singular occurrence 
of the so-called illegal drug activity in Garbo's house. The same does 
not satisfy the requirement in 
Galicia
. Garbo, therefore, cannot be considered a maintainer of drug den. Besides, the supposed 
corpus delicti
 was not even established in view of the clear violation of the chain of custody rule, compromising its integrity.


Second
, SPO2 Antillon, Jr. testified that while inside Garbo's house, he saw Gutierrez using 
shabu
, thus, making Garbo's house a drug den.


We disagree. At the moment .SPO2 Antillon, Jr. saw Gutierrez allegedly sniffing something, he only assumed it was 
shabu
.
 More, nothing in the records show that Gutierrez underwent a laboratory
 examination and was found positive for drug use. Thus, the Court will 
not convict an accused, 
sans
 any supporting evidence. Mere 
assumptions or conjectures cannot substitute the required quantum of 
evidence in criminal prosecution.
[43]
 In any case, a single isolated occasion where one sees another person sniffing 
shabu

 inside a residence, even if true, does not automatically convert that 
residence into a den. The element of regularity is conspicuously absent.


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
GRANTED
. The assailed Decision dated June 23, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08364 is 
REVERSED
