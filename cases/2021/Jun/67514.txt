LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case


Petitioner Sally Go-Bangayan
 assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 88214 entitled 
SALLY GO-BANGAYAN, represented by SIXTA L. GO v. SPOUSES LEONCIO HO AND JUDY CHAM HO:


 
 
1) 
 
Decision
[1]
 dated May 11, 2012 
dismissing petitioner's complaint for failure to prove her cause of 
action for sum of money against respondent Spouses Leoncio and Judy Cham
 Ho, by preponderance of evidence; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)
 
Resolution
[2]
 dated July 30, 2012 denying reconsideration.
 
 


Antecedents


By 
Complaint
[3]
 dated 
October 3,2001, petitioner, through her sister-in-law Sixta L. Go sued 
respondents Spouses Leoncio Ho and Judy Cham Ho for sum money and 
damages. She essentially alleged: 

In October 1997, respondents obtained a P700,000.00 loan from her for 
three percent (3%) monthly interest. Though respondents were able to pay
 the monthly interest, they failed to promptly settle the principal 
loan. Eventually, after a series of verbal demands for payment, 
respondent Judy issued two (2) 
crossed checks
 from her joint 
account with Leoncio at Philippine Bank of Communications: A336519 dated
 October 6, 1997 and A336520 dated October 30, 1997 for P200,000.00 and 
P500,000.00, respectively. Sixta personally received these checks at 
respondents' office in Dimasalang, Manila.


Before the respective maturity dates of the checks, respondents pleaded 
with her not to deposit the checks as they planned to redeem them in 
cash. She accommodated their request. A month later, she followed up 
with respondents on their promise but to no avail. Meantime, she 
entrusted the collection to Sixta as she had to go to Canada. 
When she returned to the Philippines in August 2001, she and Sixta 
demanded payment from respondents anew. But still, respondents failed to
 settle their obligation.


Finally losing temper and patience, she had Sixta's husband Alan S. Go 
personally deliver a final demand letter dated September 20, 2001 to 
respondents. Despite Judy's receipt of the letter, however, respondents 
just continued to ignore her. Thus, she sued respondents and prayed that
 they be ordered to jointly and severally pay the following:


 
 
(a)
 
P700,000.00 as principal obligation;
 
 
 
(b) 
 
P329,000.00
 as accrued interest of P700,000.00 for four (4) years reckoned from 
October 1997 until October 2001 at the rate of 12% per 

annum
 plus accruing interests;
 
 
 
(c)
 
P140,000.00 as attorney's fees at the rate of 20% on the principal obligation of P700,000.00; and
 
 
 
(d)
 
P50,000.00 as actual damages.
 
 


The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court - Branch 217, Quezon City and summonses were issued as a matter of course.


In their 
Answer
,
[4]
 
respondents sought the outright dismissal of the complaint for alleged 
lack of jurisdiction since there was supposedly no loan agreement to 
begin with. They denied ever obtaining a loan from petitioner who 
allegedly failed to prove that they received the P700,000.00 loan. 
Petitioner's claim, therefore, was unfounded pursuant to the Statute of 
Frauds which provided that no suit or action shall be maintained unless 
there shall be a note or memorandum in writing signed by the party to be
 charged. 

They further countered that petitioner requested Judy to issue the 
subject checks for discounting by financiers known to petitioner. 
Failing to find one, petitioner returned and requested that Judy write 
her (petitioner's) name in the checks. Despite their agreement to have 
the checks discounted, petitioner suddenly made herself scarce. They 
were surprised when they received summons relative to the present case. 

As for the subject checks, they were already stale by the year 2001, 
hence, it was fraudulent to revive them as evidence of petitioner's 
false claim of indebtedness. Leoncio, on the other hand, was never privy
 to the discounting arrangement between petitioner and Judy. 
By way of counterclaim, respondents sought:


(a) Moral damages of P2,000,000.00;

(b) Exemplary damages of P1,000,000.00;
(c) Attorney's fees of P150,000.00;
 (d) Litigation expenses of P50,000.00; and
 (e) P2,000.00 per court appearance.


In her 
Reply
,
[5]
 
petitioner maintained that the trial court correctly assumed 
jurisdiction over the complaint. Too, the Statute of Frauds was not 
applicable to respondents' obligation.

During the pre-trial,
[6]
 the parties stipulated on the following:


 
 
1)
 
The
 due execution and issuance of Philippine Bank of Communications Checks 
Nos. A336519 dated October 6, 1997 and A336520 dated October 30, 1997, 
for Php200,000.00 and Php500,000.00, respectively; and
 
 
 
2)
 
The subject checks were crossed checks.
 
 


At the trial proper, 
petitioner
 essentially affirmed the 
allegations in her complaint: She handed respondents P700,000.00 in 
October 1997 and respondents, in turn, issued the subject checks. The 
exchange of loan proceeds and the subject checks was not simultaneous as
 the checks were issued for the pre-existing debt of P700,000.00. 

In response to the court's clarificatory questions, petitioner testified
 that she personally granted respondents the P200,000.00 loan on July 6,
 1997 and another P500,000.00 loan on July 30, 1997. In exchange, 
respondents issued the subject post-dated checks - October 6, 1997 for 
P200,000.00 and October 30, 1997 for P500,000.00. She entrusted the 
collection thereof to Sixta.
[7]
 


Sixta
 corroborated petitioner's testimony. She testified that 
respondents received P200,000.00 and P500,000.00 cash loans on July 6 
and 30, 1997, respectively. In exchange, respondents issued the subject 
checks. She added that she even accompanied petitioner sometime in 
September 1997 to collect interest on respondents' loans.
[8]


Respondent 
Leoncio
 stood firm in his position that he and Judy 
never obtained any loan from petitioner and that the checks were issued 
for rediscounting purposes.
[9]


Ruling of the Trial Court


By Decision 
[10]
 dated October 27, 2006, the trial court ruled in petitioner's favor:


WHEREFORE,
 judgment is hereby rendered in favor of 
the plaintiff and against the defendant spouses Leoncio Ho and Judy Cham
 Ho[,] ordering said spouses[,] jointly and severally[,l to pay the 
plaintiff:


1. the amount of P700,000.00 with interest thereon at the 
rate of 12% per annum starting October 04, 2001 (when the complaint was 
filed) and until paid; and[,]

2. the amount of P70,000.00 as and for attorney's fees.


Cost as[sic] against[the] defendants.


SO ORDERED.
[11]


The trial court held that petitioner sufficiently established her cause of action. Under Section 24
[12]

 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, a party to an instrument like herein
 petitioner was presumed to have acquired the same for a consideration 
or for value, which, in this case, was a pre-existing debt. The fact 
that the subject checks were crossed checks negated any supposed 
rediscounting arrangement.

The trial court awarded attorney's fees of P70,000.00 only.


Proceedings before the Court of Appeals


On appeal,
[13]
 respondents 
faulted the trial court for granting petitioner's complaint despite her 
purported failure to support her cause of action. They insisted that the
 trial court had no jurisdiction over the case because there never was a
 loan agreement between them and petitioner. Too, they faulted the trial
 court for not applying the Statute of Frauds and for holding that a 
crossed check cannot be rediscounted. 
On the other hand,
[14]
 
petitioner supported the trial court's dispositions. She averred that 
respondents' admission that the checks were genuine and duly executed 
was sufficient proof of their indebtedness. 


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


Through its assailed Decision
[15]

 dated May 11, 2012, the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that 
petitioner failed to prove the existence of the loan, let alone, that 
the checks were issued in payment thereof. The appellate court hinged 
such conclusion on the following supposed inconsistencies: 


One.
 Petitioner failed to establish the exact date the loan was 
given to respondents. On direct, petitioner testified that respondents 
obtained the loan from her sometime in October 1997. On cross, however, 
she stated that respondents did not issue the subject checks on the same
 date the loan was obtained. To the court's clarificatory question, she 
said that respondents obtained the loan on July 6 and 30, 1997. 


Two.
 In the complaint, petitioner alleged that respondents 
obtained the loan first, paid interest for a few months, then issued the
 subject checks after they were unable to settle the obligation. During 
the trial, however, petitioner categorically stated the checks were 
issued on the same day she gave them the loan.


Three.
 In the complaint, petitioner allegedly made several 
demands a month before the maturity dates of the checks and before she 
left for Canada. But during the clarificatory hearings, she said she was
 already in Canada at the time the checks became due and demandable in 
October 1997. 
The Present Petition


Petitioner
[16]
 now seeks 
affirmative relief from the Court, claiming she sufficiently established
 respondents' indebtedness to her. She points out that respondents 
admitted the authenticity and due execution of the checks during the 
pre-trial conference which served as indubitable proof of their 
indebtedness. Under the Negotiable Instruments Law, such admission 
entitles her to collect payment of the amount indicated therein.

In their Comment,
[17]
 
respondents defend the dispositions of the Court of Appeals. They 
counter that petitioner failed to prove her cause of action against them
 by preponderance of evidence. This is bolstered by the absence of a 
written agreement to establish petitioner's claim as required under the 
Statute of Frauds.


Threshold Issue


Was petitioner able to establish her cause of action for sum of money against respondents by preponderance of evidence?


Ruling


Preliminarily, the Court finds that the issue presented for resolution 
is a question of fact which, as a general rule, cannot be entertained. 
For this Court is not a trier of facts; only errors of law are generally
 reviewed in petitions for review on 
certiorari
 criticizing decisions of the Court of Appeals.
[18]

 This rule, however, admits of exceptions as when the inference made is 
manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; when the judgment is based on
 a misapprehension of facts; and when the findings of fact by the Court 
of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court, as in here.
[19]

 In all these instances, the Court will review the factual findings of 
the tribunals and make its own factual appreciation relevant to the 
issue at hand to prevent grave injustice.


Here, petitioner alleged that respondents obtained from her two (2) 
separate loans, 
i.e.
, P200,000.00 on July 6, 1997 and for 
P500,000.00 on July 30, 1997, or a total of P700,000.00. As proof of 
their indebtedness, respondents issued and delivered to petitioner two 
(2) Philippine Bank of Communications crossed checks, A336519 dated 
October 6, 1997 and A336520 dated October 30, 1997 for P200,000.00 and 
P500,000.00, respectively. Both crossed checks were in the name of 
petitioner as payee. On their respective maturity dates, respondents 
requested that petitioner hold the encashment or deposit of the checks 
as they planned to redeem them in cash. As it was though, respondents 
never again communicated with her, ignored her subsequent demands to 
pay, and never paid their indebtedness. 

Respondents, however, denied that they incurred the loans in question. 
For although they issued and delivered the crossed checks to petitioner,
 the same were meant only to be discounted supposedly by financiers 
known to petitioner.

We find for petitioner.


First.
 Section 24 of the Negotiable Instruments Law embodies the 
presumption that when negotiable instruments such as checks are 
delivered to their intended payees, such instruments have been issued 
for value, 
viz
.:


Sec. 24.
 
Presumption of consideration
. - Every
 negotiable instrument is deemed prima facie to have been issued for a 
valuable consideration; and every person whose signature appears thereon
 to have become a party thereto for value.


Meanwhile, Section 25 of the same law expressly recognizes a 
preÂ­existing debt as valid consideration to support the issuance of a 
negotiable instrument like a check:


Sec. 25.
 
Value, what constitutes
. â Value is any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. 
An antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes value
; and is deemed such whether the instrument is payable on demand or at a future time.


Here, respondents admitted the genuineness and due execution of the 
crossed checks they issued in petitioner's name. As such, the 
presumption that said checks were for valuable consideration comes into 
play. Notably, respondents failed to rebut this presumption. All they 
offered was a bare denial that they incurred the loans in exchange for 
their checks. Surely, bare denial, without more, is not sufficient to 
overthrow the presumption under Section 24 of the Negotiable Instruments
 Law. We therefore give credence to petitioner's claim that the checks 
were issued and delivered to her by respondents in payment of their 
indebtedness to her.


At any rate; it is contrary to human experience for a person to issue 
checks without receiving valuable consideration, even in rediscounting 
agreements. It is also contrary to human experience for respondents to 
sit on their right to retrieve or at least issue a stop payment order 
for the subject checks which remained with petitioner for four (4) 
years, especially so if they did not receive anything in exchange as 
they claim. For the indiscriminate issuance of checks could have exposed
 them to possible criminal liability for violation of Batas Pambansa 
Blg. 22.


Second.
 The fact that the subject checks are crossed checks in 
the name of petitioner, by itself, negates respondents' theory of a 
rediscounting arrangement.

Under accepted banking practice, crossing a check is done by writing two
 parallel lines diagonally on the left top portion of the checks. It has
 the following effects:


(a) the check may not be encashed but only deposited in the bank;
(b) the check may be negotiated 
only once
 â to one who has an account with a bank; and
(c) the act of crossing the check serves as 
warning
 to the holder that the check has been issued 
for a definite purpose
 so that he must inquire if he has received the check pursuant to that purpose, otherwise, he is 
not a holder in due course
.
[20]


In 
Bank of America, NT & SA v. Associated Citizens Bank
,
[21]

 the Court has taken judicial cognizance of the practice that a check 
with two (2) parallel lines in the upper left-hand corner means that it 
could only be deposited and could not be converted into cash. Thus, the 
effect of crossing a check relates to the mode of payment, meaning that 
the drawer had intended the check for deposit only by the rightful 
person, 
i.e.
, the payee named therein.


Here, respondents do not deny, as they in fact admitted during the 
preÂ­trial, that the subject checks in the name of petitioner were 
crossed. Respondents claim, though, that said checks were issued solely 
for purposes of rediscounting. 
But it is not possible to rediscount a crossed check in the name of a particular payee.

 For check rediscounting requires the re-indorsement of the negotiable 
instrument; an act precluded by the crossing of a check. No financier in
 his or her right mind would part with his or her money for a crossed 
check in the name of another.


Third.
 Respondents did not deny, much less, protest the demand letter dated September 20, 2001 which respondent Judy received, 
viz
.:


 
 
ATTY. RIVERA:
 
Can
 you recall sometime on September 20, 2001, the brother of the plaintiff
 Sally Bangayan went to your residence and delivered a demand letter and
 likewise you having signed and acknowledged receipt in relation to that
 demand letter?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. ESLAO: 
 
You show the demand letter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
I did receive the demand letter but I didn't sign, but it seems this is not my signature, Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
The question is, do you admit having received that demand letter?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
I received a demand letter, yes but. (interrupted)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
Don't qualify. If you are admitting that you received it?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
Yes, your Honor.
[22]
 
 


If there was never a loan agreement to begin with as respondents would 
have this Court believe, reason and experience dictates that they should
 have disputed or at least protested the alleged indebtedness. But 
respondents did not. They even claimed surprise when they received 
summonses from the trial court relative to this case. 


Finally.
 Respondents' invocation of the Statute of Frauds is 
misplaced. Contrary to their claim, the checks themselves serve as the 
written note or memorandum they were looking for. That the checks 
themselves are the evidence of indebtedness and no separate document is 
required as proof. 

In 
Ubas, Sr. v. Chan
,
[23]

 the Court held that where the plaintiff-creditor possesses and submits 
in evidence an instrument showing indebtedness, a presumption that the 
credit has not been satisfied arises in his or her favor. Thus, the 
defendant-debtor is required to overcome the said presumption and 
present countervailing evidence to prove the fact of payment so that no 
judgment will be entered against him or her.


In accordance with 
Ubas
, petitioner herein is deemed to 
have substantiated her cause of action by a preponderance of evidence by
 simply being the holder and named payee of respondents' crossed checks 
which are presumed to have been issued for a valuable consideration.


The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, ruled otherwise. It made much ado of
 the inconsistencies in petitioner's testimony pertaining to the date 
when the loan was obtained, whether the checks were issued upon 
turn-over of the cash loan, and when demands for payment were made.


But these inconsistencies did not diminish petitioner's credibility. For
 they pertain wholly to trivial matters and are irrelevant in 
determining whether respondents actually took out a loan from 
petitioner. Whether the P700,000.00 loan was released in its entirety in
 October 1997 or in two tranches in July 1997, the fact remains that 
respondents received the entire amount. Petitioner's previous demands 
for payment, too, became immaterial in light of the final demand letter 
dated September 20, 2001 personally delivered to respondents by her 
husband Alan S. Go. 
At any rate, the factual findings of the trial court on the credibility 
of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect and the
 highest consideration. Deviation from the rule is allowed only when the
 circumstances of the case show that the trial court has overlooked 
facts which will substantially alter the results of its adjudication. 
Corollary to this, it has likewise been consistently ruled that 
credibility is a matter that is peculiarly within the province of the 
trial judge, who had first-hand opportunity to watch and observe the 
demeanor and behavior of the witnesses at the time of their testimony.
[24]


Thus, as with the trial court, we find that the evidence on record and 
the attendant circumstances preponderates in favor of petitioner. 
Respondents, therefore, are ordered to jointly and severally settle 
their principal obligation of P700,000.00.


As for petitioner's claim of stipulated interest of three percent (3%) 
per month, we are constrained to deny the same. Article 1956 ordains 
that No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in
 writing. Thus, in the absence of any written proof of the supposed 
stipulation, petitioner's claim of interest has no factual basis. At any
 rate, even if proved, the Court would have just struck it down for 
being unconscionable.
[25]


Instead, we impose the legal interest rates in accordance with pertinent
 jurisprudence. Consequently, legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per
 
annum
 is imposed pursuant to 
Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
[26]

 from extrajudicial demand on September 21, 2001 until June 30, 2013. 
Thereafter, the legal interest rate is reduced to six percent (6%) per 
annum
 from July 1, 2013 until finality of this decision pursuant to 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
.
[27]
 
Meanwhile, since respondents' act has compelled petitioner to litigate and incur expenses to protect her interest,
[28]
 the Court deems it proper to award attorney's fees of P30,000.00 as shown by the cash voucher issued by Rivera Law Office.
[29]
 

All monetary awards further shall earn six percent (6%) interest per 
annum
 from finality of this decision until fully paid.
[30]
 


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
GRANTED
, the Decision dated May 11, 2012 and Resolution dated July 30, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA- G.R. CV No. 88214,
