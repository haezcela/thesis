PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE (PCSO), PETITIONER, VS. DFNN, INC. (DFNNI), RESPONDENT.




LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Cases


In 
G.R. No. 232801
, the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) assails the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in 
CAâG.R. SP No. 145462
 entitled 
DFNN,
 Inc. v. Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), Hon. Judge 
Rizalina T. Capco-Umali (in her capacity as Presiding Judge of Branch 
212, Regional Trial Court of Mandaluyong City)
:


Decision
[1]

 dated February 20, 2017 reversing the Order dated April 11, 2016 of the
 Regional Trial Court-Branch 212, Mandaluyong City (RTC-Mandaluyong) and
 ordering the consolidation of Civil Case No. MCI5-9557 with Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844 before the Regional Trial Court-Branch 66, Makati
 City (RTC-Makati); and


Resolution
[2]
 dated July 10, 2017 denying the motion for reconsideration of PCSO.


On the other hand, in 
G.R. No. 234193
, PCSO assails the dispositions of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 145983
 entitled 
Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) v. DFNN, Inc., viz
.:


Decision
[3]
 
dated November 17, 2016 affirming the Decision dated February 17, 2016 
and Order dated May 18, 2016 of the RTC-Makati in Special Proceedings 
No. M-7844 which increased the award of damages decreed in the subject 
Arbitral Award in favor of DFNNI; and


Resolution
[4]
 dated August 31, 2017 denying the motion for reconsideration of PCSO.


Antecedents


On April 9,2003, petitioner PCSO and respondent DFNNI
[5]
 entered into an Equipment Lease Agreement (ELA) for systems design and development and upgrade of a lotto betting platform 
via
 Personal Communication Devices (PCD)
[6]
.
 Under the ELA, PCSO agreed to exclusively lease from DFNNI all 
hardware, software and technical skills to design and develop the 
application of PCD for the acceptance and processing of bets from PCD 
users in the Philippines. The ELA contained an arbitration clause 
mandating that any dispute or controversy shall be settled through 
arbitration.
[7]



On March 9, 2005, prior to the launch of the System, PCSO issued Board 
Resolution No. 080, series of 2005 unilaterally rescinding the ELA for 
DFNNI's supposed failure to comply with its obligations and commitment, 
including the implementation of the project within six (6) months from 
the execution of the contract, 
viz
.:


"WHEREAS,
 DFN[N]I, in a letter to GM Rosario Uriarte,
 dated January 18, 2005, admitted and confirmed its failure to secure 
the conformity and cooperation of Smart and Globe and instead (sic) 
argued that "the signed contracts were the obligations of the 
PCSO[,]"(sic) despite the clear agreement between the parties that it 
should be DFN[N]I that should procure the conformity of the telecoms 
w[h]ile conceding that the final contract should be signed by PCSO[;]


WHEREAS,
 to date, only minor telecom players, namely, Sun 
Cellular and Nextel, has expressed their intention to cooperate in 
implementing the proposed project. Considering the limited number of 
subscribers of the Sun Cellular and Nextel, the text betting project is 
no longer feasible, as it will not generate the projected income, as 
proposed;



WHEREAS,
 PGMC, in its letter dated July 20,2004, from Mr. Kenny 
Low, Vice President for Operations, cited the potentially grave risks to
 the integrity of the PCSO online lottery central system due to the 
interconnection. Thus, PCSO and its lottery system runs a grave risk in 
incurring problems relating to technical glitches, validation and 
claiming of winnings due to the proposed interface of systems;


WHEREAS,
 in light of the foregoing, it appears that the System 
built by DFNN[I] cannot interface into the PGMC's system in a seamless 
manner, thereby putting grave risks in the PCSO's betting systems, which
 could generate controversies and negative publicity that will adversely
 affect the integrity of the lotto project as well as the established 
trust of the playing public in PCSO's lotto game;


WHEREFORE,
 for all the foregoing reasons, to wit: non-fulfillment
 of a suspensive condition relative to the interconnection cooperation 
with PGMC and ILTS as well as the non-conformity of Globe and/or Smart 
making the text betting project no longer feasible, doubts against the 
legality of the ELA as being contrary to laws, morals and public policy;
 lack of authority of DFN[N]I to engage in the proposed undertaking; 
absence of public bidding, as well as doubts arising from the unsigned 
Minutes of the Meetings where the authority to enter into the ELA was 
allegedly given, 
RESOLVED, THAT THE BOARD NOW RESCIND, AS IT HEREBY 
RESCINDS, THE ELA DATED APRIL 9, 2003 BETWEEN THE PCSO AND DFN[N]I, COPY
 OF WHICH IS ATTACHED HERETO AND MADE AN INTEGRAL PART HEREOF;"
[8]
 (Emphasis retained.)


By letter dated April 5, 2005, PCSO informed DFNNI of the rescission. On
 December 12, 2005, DFNNI replied, asking for a possible solution 
acceptable to all parties concerned.


On December 14, 2007, DFNNI wrote to PCSO requesting, this time, for 
voluntary proceedings to resolve the issues which led to the 
cancellation of the ELA. PCSO denied the request.
[9]

 Thus, DFNNI subsequently filed a Request for Arbitration against PCSO 
where it claimed PhP1,913,948,850.00 as liquidated damages based on the 
estimated revenue of the project, inclusive of temperate damages, 
attorney's fees, and litigation costs.


Proceedings before the 
Ad Hoc
 Arbitration Panel


An 
Ad Hoc
 Arbitration Panel was consequently constituted, chaired
 by Atty. Victor N. Alimurung, with members Atty. Fulgencio S. Factoran,
 Jr. and Atty. Jose Tomas C. Syquia.

During the arbitration proceedings,
[10]

 DFNNI claimed that PCSO had no legitimate ground to rescind the ELA. 
Since the rescission was void, the ELA should be reinstated and it 
(DFNNI) should be awarded temperate damages of P2,000,000.00 and 
attorney's fees of P1,000,000.00. Should reinstatement no longer be 
feasible, PCSO should pay P1,913,948,850.00 as liquidated damages.


PCSO countered that the rescission was valid because DFNNI failed to: 
(a) integrate its system with PCSO's existing lessors, Philippine Gaming
 Management Corporation (PGMC) and Pacific On-line System Corporation; 
(b) elicit the conformity and cooperation of Globe and Smart to 
implement PCD betting; and (c) deliver the system within six (6) months 
from execution of ELA.
[11]



In sum, the parties asked the Arbitration Panel to: (a) rule on the 
validity of the rescission of the ELA; and (b) should the rescission be 
found invalid, determine the award of damages due DFNNI, if any.
[12]


The Arbitral Award


By Arbitral Award dated May 21, 2015,
[13]

 the rescission was declared to be improper, and DFNNI, consequently 
entitled to liquidated damages of P27,000,000.00 and the return of its 
equipment, 
viz
.:


Claimant DFNNI is entitled to
Liquidated damages as provided 
in the
ELA.



As the defaulting party, PCSO's liability for damages is governed by Section 13.2(i) of the ELA, which provides as follows:


 
 
(i)
 
PCSO,
 if it is the party in default, shall pay DFNN[I] liquidated damages in 
the amount (sic) equal to the market value of the System plus rental 
payments for the unexpired term of this Agreement as provided under 
Section 10.2 and 10.3 hereof, inclusive of a penalty charge of two 
percent (2%) per month on the amount due computed from the date of 
termination or cancellation of the Agreement to the actual date of 
payment. For the purposes of this provision, 
"market value" shall be stipulated at Twenty Seven Million Pesos (P27,000.000)

 less depreciation of twelve and one half percent (12.5%) per year 
beginning from execution of this Agreement. "Unexpired term of rental 
payments" shall be computed based on the lease charge of five percent 
(5%) of the total value of bets placed through this System provided by 
DFNN[I] or the amount of Five Pesos (P5.00) per successful registrant 
under the System, whichever is higher, at the time such default shall 
have occurred multiplied by the remaining period of the term of this 
Agreement. PCSO shall also return the System to DFNN[I] in accordance 
with Section 9.2 hereof.
 
 


x x x x


In addition to liquidated damages, the parties likewise agreed that 
PCSO, if the defaulting party, shall pay DFNN[I] for rental for the 
unexpired term of the ELA.
 
The Arbitration Panel holds that the award of the stipulated liquidated 
damages as set forth in the ELA is just and reasonable. PCSO did not 
present any evidence to prove that the market value of the system as 
defined in the ELA is excessive, or is iniquitous or unconscionable.


The provision on depreciation cannot be considered (or deducted) since 
the ELA was terminated even before the System could be launched on a 
commercial basis. For the same reason, rental payments for the unexpired
 term of the rental payment cannot be granted since the said rental 
payments axe to be "computed based on the lease charge of five percent 
(5%) of the total value of bets placed through this system provided by 
DFNN[I] or the amount of Five pesos (5.00) per successful registrant 
under the system, whichever is higher, at the time such default shall 
have occurred multiplied by the remaining period of the term of this 
Agreement." Since the System was never commercially launched, any claim 
for the unexpired term of rental payments would be purely speculative.

x x x x


DFNN[I] did submit a feasibility study on projected lotto bettings using
 DFNN[I]'s System. Since there was no commercial launch of the System, 
however, there obviously were no successful registrants or total value 
of bets that could serve as a basis for computing the rental payments 
for the unexpired term of the ELA. Projections are plainly speculative 
and based on conjecture. Significantly, DFNN[I] did not present any 
witness to substantiate or validate its projections. Thus, in the 
absence of competent/reliable evidence, DFNN[I]'s claim for the rental 
payments on a System which was never commercially launched cannot be 
granted.


On the two percent interest, it is evident that the interest referred to
 unpaid lease rentals. As there are no lease rentals due, neither can 
there be any interest thereon.


WHEREFORE, ALL ABOVE PREMISES CONSIDERED
, the Arbitration Panel 
rules that respondent Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office improperly 
terminated its Equipment Lease Agreement with DFNN[I], Inc. Accordingly,
 PCSO is hereby ordered to pay DFNN[I], Inc. the amount of Twenty Seven 
Million Pesos (PhP27,000,000.00) as liquidated damages, in accordance 
with the terms of the Equipment Lease Agreement."
 
SO ORDERED
[14]


Several cases had since ensued between the parties. 
Judicial Proceedings


On June 25, 2015, 
PCSO filed a 
Petition for Confirmation
[15]
 of the Arbitral Award before the 
RTC-Mandaluyong
 via 
Civil Case No. MC15Â­9557
. A day after, 
DFNNI filed a 
Petition for Correction
 of the same Arbitral Award with the RTC-Makati, docketed as 
Special Proceedings No. M- 7844
.
[16]
 Both petitions were found to be sufficient in form and substance. 


Petition for Correction
 
Special Proceedings No. M-7844 
CA-G.R. SPNos. 145983 and 150401

G.R. No. 234193


a. Special Proceedings No. M-7844


DFNNI alleged that there was evident miscalculation of the award of 
damages in the Arbitral Award. It was entitled to P310,095,149.70, 
taking into account the two percent (2%) penalty interest per month on 
the amount due in accordance with Par. 13.2(i) of the ELA. The 
Arbitration Panel also failed to award temperate damages and attorney's 
fees.
[17]
 In fine, DFNNI 
prayed for "correction" of the arbitral award to include the 2% 
interest, temperate damages and attorney's fees. 
PCSO riposted that DFNNI is not entitled to penalty interest as the same
 only applies to rental payments. Since there is no rental payment 
involved here, Par. 13.2(i) of the ELA is inapplicable. As for DFNNI's 
claim for temperate damages and attorney's fees, the same cannot be 
granted for lack of basis.
[18]
 


As borne in its Decision
[19]
 
dated February 17, 2016, the RTC-Makati granted DFNNI's Petition for Correction
,
 increasing the award of liquidated damages to P310,095,149.70, plus six
 percent (6%) interest per annum from finality until fully paid: 

WHEREFORE, premises considered, in accordance with the authority granted
 by Section 11.4(C) of the ADR Rules to this Court to correct arbitral 
awards, the award for liquidated damages in the Arbitral Award dated May
 21, 2015[,] is hereby corrected to Php310,095,149.70, plus 6% interest 
from [date] of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction 
thereof.


It ruled that based on Par. 13.2(i) of the ELA, the 2% penalty charge 
per month is computed based on "the amount due" which refers to the 
"market value of System plus rental payments for the unexpired term of 
this Agreement, inclusive of a penalty charge of two percent (2%) per 
month on the amount due computed from the date of termination or 
cancellation of the Agreement to the actual date of payment." 
Consequently, the RTC-Makati imposed the penalty charge on the 
P27,000,000.00, resulting in liquidated damages of P310,095,149.70.
[20]
 

The RTC-Makati denied reconsideration on May 18, 2016. Hence, PCSO went to the Court of Appeals 
via

 petition for review under Rule 19.12 of A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC or the 
Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (Special ADR 
Rules). The petition was docketed as CA- G.R. SP No. 145983.


b. CA-G.R. SP No. 145983
 
PCSO alleged in the main that the RTC-Makati gravely erred in 
correcting/modifying the Arbitral Award considering that (a) DFNNI was 
guilty of forum shopping; (b) the RTC-Makati had no jurisdiction to act 
on the petition for correction in view of the doctrines of judicial 
stability and nonÂ­interference of co-equal courts; and (c) there was no 
evident miscalculation of figures in the Arbitral Award.
[21]
 
DFNNI argued: (a) there was no intent to commit forum shopping because 
it filed the petition for correction a day after the petition for 
confirmation; (b) when the RTC-Makati issued the order taking cognizance
 of the petition for correction, it had no knowledge of Civil Case No. 
MC15Â­9557; and (c) based on Par. 13.2(i) of the ELA, the 2% penalty 
charge on rental payments should also be imposed on the P27,000,000.00 
liquidated damages.
[22]


By Decision
[23]
 
dated November 17, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed
, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE,
 all the above premises considered, the petition is 
DISMISSED
.
 Accordingly, the assailed Decision dated February 17, 2016 of the 
Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 66, in SP PROC. NO. M-7844 
as well as the Order dated May 18, 2016 are hereby 
AFFIRMED
.

SO ORDERED.


It ruled that DFNNI was not guilty of forum shopping as it could not 
have known PCSO's filing of its petition for confirmation before the 
RTC-Mandaluyong when it filed its own petition for correction before the
 RTC-Makati a day after. For the same reason, the RTC-Makati could not 
be deemed to have violated the doctrines of judicial stability and 
non-interference. Finally, on the alleged evident miscalculation, the 
Court of Appeals adopted the position of the RTC-Makati.
[24]
 PCSO's motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied on August 31, 2017. 
Dissatisfied, PCSO appealed to the Court via 
G.R. No. 234193
 under Rule 19.36 of the Special ADR Rules. 


c. CA-G.R. SP No. 150401
 
Meantime, by Order dated December 7, 2016, the RTC-Makati granted 
DFNNI's motion for writ of execution and promptly issued the writ on 
December 9, 2016. 
Aggrieved once again, PCSO went back to the Court of Appeals under Rule 
9.26 of the Special ADR Rules through
 CA-G.R. SP No. 150401
. It 
sought to nullify on ground of grave abuse of discretion the Order dated
 December 7, 2016, Writ of Execution dated December 9, 2016 and Order 
dated March 10, 2017, all issued by the RTC-Makati in Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844.


Petition for Confirmation
 
Civil Case No. MCI5-9557 
CA-GR SP No. 145462

G.R. No. 232801


a. Civil Case No. MC15-9557
 
In the interim, on July 16, 2015, DFNNI "filed with the RTC-Mandaluyong,
 a motion for consolidation of Civil Case No. MCI5-9557 with Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844 before the RTC-Makati. It invoked Rule 11.5 of 
the Special ADR Rules on consolidation of cases. 

PCSO opposed on the ground that the RTC-Mandaluyong had already acquired
 jurisdiction over the case upon its declaration that the petition for 
confirmation is sufficient in form and substance. More, DFNNI was guilty
 of forum shopping.
[25]
 


Under Order dated April 11, 2016, the RTC-Mandaluyong denied the
 
motion for consolidation. It noted that Rule 11.5 of the Special ADR 
Rules uses the word "may" which is permissive and operates to confer 
discretion.
[26]


The RTC-Mandaluyong, thus, proceeded to hear the main petition for 
confirmation. On the one hand, PCSO invoked Section 23, Republic Act No.
 876 (RA 876) to support its petition for confirmation of the 
Arbitration Award. On the other hand, DFNNI, through its comment 
ad cautelam
, manifested that it already filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 145462

 assailing the denial of the motion for consolidation. At any rate, it 
claimed that it was not questioning the Arbitral Award, only the 
so-called evident miscalculation of the amount of damages granted 
therein. It reiterated that the RTC-Makati had already resolved Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844, rendering Civil Case No. MC15-9557 moot. In 
reply, PCSO countered that the supposed miscalculation was unfounded and
 that the ruling of the RTC-Makati did not render Civil Case No. 
MC15-9557 moot.

As borne in its 
Decision
[27]
 
dated January 5, 2017,

 the RTC-Mandaluyong confirmed the Arbitral Award. It held that contrary
 to DFNNI's assertion, there was no evident miscalculation in the 
amounts granted in the Arbitral Award, thus:


x x x x

Examining carefully the 
Ad Hoc
 Arbitration Panel's Arbitral Award
 dated May 21, 2015, particularly on the discussion on the award of 
liquidated damages in favor of the Respondent, the latter's claim of 
evident miscalculation is clearly unfounded. On the contrary, the Panel 
even painstakingly elaborated on the proper application of the pertinent
 provision of the ELA, specifically, Section 13.2 (i) thereof and made a
 detailed discussion as to the proper interpretation of the same as 
appearing on pages 18 to 20 of subject Arbitral Award. Even the 
application of the penalty charge of two percent (2%) upon which the 
Respondent bases its claim of evident miscalculation was clearly 
interpreted by the 
Ad Hoc
 Panel as follows:

"On the two percent interest, it is evident that the interest 
referred to unpaid lease rentals. As there are no lease rentals due, 
neither can there be any interest thereon."
Nothing more can get any clearer than the foregoing disquisition made by
 the Panel relative to the penalty charge of two percent (2%). 
Concededly, the claim of miscalculation, much less an "evident" one, is 
completely baseless and therefore must necessarily fail. Therefore, the 
court must strictly apply the provision of Rule 11.9 of the Special ADR 
Rules which mandates that the court shall not disturb the arbitral 
tribunal's determination of facts and/or interpretation of law.

x x x x

In sum, to warrant any correction or modification or even vacation of an
 arbitral award, the arbiter's findings must clearly, convincingly and 
unequivocally show that the grounds enumerated in the Special ADR Rule 
are indeed present. Thus, the settled is that 
"courts are without 
power to amend or overrule merely because of disagreement with matters 
of law or facts determined by the arbitrators. They will not review the 
findings of law and fact contained in an award, and will not undertake 
to substitute their judgement for that of the arbitrators, since any 
other rule would make an award the commencement, not the end, of 
litigation. Errors of law and fact, or an erroneous decision of matters 
submitted to the judgment of the arbitrators, are insufficient to 
invalidate an award fairly and honestly made.

WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the instant Petition is

CONFIRMED
.

SO ORDERED.


b. CA-G.R. SP No. 145462
 

Exactly forty-six (46) days following the promulgation of the foregoing decision, the Court of Appeals, by 
Decision
[28]
 
dated February 20, 2017,

 granted the petition of DFNNI and ordered the RTC-Mandaluyong to 
consolidate Civil Case No. MC15-9557 with Special Proceedings No. M-7844
 before the RTC-Makati, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the instant petition is hereby 
GRANTED
. The Order dated 11 April 2016 is hereby 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. The Regional Trial Court, Branch 212, Mandaluyong City is hereby 
ORDERED

 to consolidated Civil Case No. MC15-9557 with that of Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844 before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 66, 
Makati City.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.


In ordering the consolidation, the Court of Appeals cited two reasons. 
One
,
 the RTC-Mandaluyong did not acquire jurisdiction over the case as 
PCSO's petition for confirmation was prematurely filed on the 29
th
 day from receipt of the Arbitral Award. Under the Special ADR Rules, such petition may only be filed 
after
 the lapse of 30 days from receipt of the Arbitral Award. 
Two
,
 the RTC-Mandaluyong should have granted the consolidation. Two cases 
involving the same parties and affecting closely related subject matters
 must be ordered consolidated and jointly tried. 
The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration on July 10, 2017.


PCSO, thus, filed yet another petition for review on certiorari
[29]
 before the Court 
via
 
G.R. No. 232801
 where it seeks to reverse and set aside the dispositions of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 145462
.


Meantime, in compliance with the order of consolidation in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 145462, the RTC-Mandaluyong forwarded the case to the RTC- Makati 
which, in turn, directed that the case be archived pending resolution of
 G.R. No. 232801.
[30]


The Present Petitions for Review on Certiorari


In 
G.R. No. 232801,
 PCSO seeks to reverse and set aside the dispositions of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 145462
 ordering the consolidation of Civil Case No. MCI 5-9557 with Special Proceedings No. M-7844 before the RTC-Makati. 
We sum up the supporting arguments of PCSO. 
First,
 a party 
seeking to correct an award may only seek such relief from the court 
where a petition for confirmation is pending. Since the petition for 
confirmation before the RTC-Mandaluyong came first, DFNNI should have 
requested relief in the same proceeding. If at all, it should be DFNNI's
 petition before the RTC-Makati which should have been consolidated with
 the petition before the RTC-Mandaluyong; 
Second
, Rule 11.5 of the Special ADR Rules allowing consolidation rests upon the discretion of the courts; 
Third
,
 the confirmation of a domestic arbitral award is governed by Section 
23, RA 876 and Section 40, Republic Act No. 9285, both stating that the 
confirmation shall be filed at any time 
within
 one month after the arbitral award is made. Accordingly, the petition for confirmation was not prematurely filed; and 
Finally
, consolidation is no longer feasible because the RTC-Makati had already issued a decision completely disposing of the case.

In its Comment,
[31]
 DFNNI 
posits that an appeal by certiorari to this Court under Rule 19.36 of 
the Special ADRRules is a special remedy intended only for serious and 
compelling reasons resulting in grave prejudice to the aggrieved party. 
Here, PCSO failed to establish that the Court of Appeals acted in a 
capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of 
its jurisdiction in rendering the decision and resolution. In any event,
 the RTC-Mandaluyong never acquired jurisdiction over the petition for 
confirmation as it was filed prematurely based on the Special ADR Rules.
 Also, it did not willfully or deliberately engage in forum shopping as 
it filed the petition for correction without knowing that the petition 
for confirmation had already been commenced. As it was though, the fact 
that the RTC-Mandaluyong had already forwarded the case to the 
RTC-Makati is a clear act of deference to the ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 
145462. 
In its Reply
[32]
 with leave of court, PCSO reiterates the arguments raised in its petition.


On the other hand, in 
G.R. No. 234193,
 PCSO faults the Court of 
Appeals for (a) declaring that DFNNI did not violate the rule against 
forum shopping under Rule 11.5 of the Special ADR Rules; (b) ruling that
 the RTC-Makati did not fail to observe the doctrine of judicial 
stability though it had knowledge of the petition before the 
RTC-Mandaluyong when it rendered its decision; and (c) adopting the 
decision of the RTC-Makati despite the fact that there was no evident 
miscalculation in the Arbitral Award requiring correction under Section 
25(a), RA 876. 
In its Comment,
[33]
 DFNNI 
reiterates that an appeal by certiorari under Rule 19.36 of the Special 
ADR Rules is a special remedy intended only for serious and compelling 
reasons resulting in grave prejudice, to the aggrieved party which PCSO 
failed to establish here. Assuming there was indeed substantial error in
 the assailed dispositions of the Court of Appeals, petitioner failed to
 indicate the same with specificity. It did not commit forum shopping. 
PCSO prematurely filed its case before the RTC-Mandaluyong. There was 
also no violation of the doctrine, of judicial stability for when 
RTC-Makati assumed jurisdiction over the petition for correction; it did
 not have knowledge of the petition for confirmation before the 
RTC-Mandaluyong. Finally, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the 
decision of the RTC- Makati as the miscalculation in the Arbitral Award 
was clear and evident. 

In its Reply
[34]
 with leave of court, PCSO echoes the arguments in its petition. 
Issues


In 
G.R. No. 232801
, did the Court of Appeals commit grave reversible error when it issued the order of consolidation in CA-G.R. SP No. 145462?


In 
G.R. No. 234193
, did the Court of Appeals commit grave 
reversible error when it affirmed the increase in the amount of the 
Arbitral Award as decreed by the RTC-Makati in Special Proceedings No. 
M-7844? 
Our Ruling


The Court of Appeals erred in 
ordering the consolidation of 
Civil
Case No. MC15-9557 with 
Special
Proceedings No. M-7844 
before
RTC-Makati


To briefly recount the events, PCSO filed a Petition for Confirmation of
 the Arbitral Award before the RTC-Mandaluyong on June 25, 2015. A day 
after, DFNNI filed a Petition for Correction of the same award with 
RTC-Makati. 

Subsequently, DFNNI filed a Motion for Consolidation dated July 16, 2015
 before the RTC-Mandaluyong for the consolidation of Civil Case No. 
MC15-9557 with Special Proceedings No. M-7844 before RTC-Makati. While 
said motion was pending, the RTC-Makati rendered its Decision dated 
February 17, 2016 granting DFNNI's Petition for Correction in Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844.


RTC-Mandaluyong then issued its Order dated April 11, 2016 denying the 
motion for consolidation in Civil Case No. MC15-9557. The proceedings 
eventually culminated in Decision dated January 5, 2017, confirming the 
arbitral award. 
As keenly observed by Senior Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas- Bernabe
 during deliberations, the trajectory of events precludes the 
consolidation of Civil Case No. MC15-9557 with Special Proceedings No. 
M-7844 before either court the RTC-Mandaluyong or RTC-Makati.


In 
Puncia v. Toyota Shaw/Pasig, Inc.
,
[35]

 the Court clarified that the rationale for consolidation is to have all
 cases, which are intimately related, acted upon by one branch of the 
court to avoid the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered 
and in effect, prevent confusion, unnecessary costs, and delay. 
An essential requisite of consolidation, however, is that the actions to be consolidated are 
pending
 before the court.
 
Here, when RTC-Mandaluyong resolved DFNNI's motion for consolidation in 
Civil Case No. MC15-9557 On April 11, 2016, RTC-Makati had already 
rendered its Decision dated February 17, 2016 in Special Proceedings No.
 M-7844. Hence, there was no more pending case before the RTC-Makati 
which could be consolidated with Civil Case No. MC15-9557. 
The Court of Appeals nevertheless granted consolidation citing two 
reasons. 
One
, the RTC-Mandaluyong did not acquire jurisdiction 
over the case as PCSO's petition for confirmation was prematurely filed 
on the 29
th
 day from receipt of the Arbitral Award; and 
Two
,
 the RTC-Mandaluyong should have granted the consolidation since the two
 cases involving the same parties and affecting closely related subject 
matters must be ordered consolidated and jointly tried. 
But whether the RTC-Mandaluyong properly acquired jurisdiction over 
Civil Case No. MC15-9557 and whether the parties and issues involved 
before the RTC-Mandaluyong and RTC-Makati are similar, have become 
wholly irrelevant in the issue of consolidation since Special 
Proceedings No. M-7844 was no longer pending and, hence, could no longer
 be consolidated with another case. 
Verily, the Court of Appeals erred when it ordered the consolidation of 
both cases before the RTC-Makati. The Order dated April 11, 2016 of the 
RTC-Mandaluyong in Civil Case No. MC15-9557 denying the consolidation 
and the Decision dated January 5, 2017 confirming the Arbitral Award 
should therefore be reinstated.


The Court of Appeals erred when it 
affirmed the increase of the arbitral 
award in favor of DFNNI
 
Under the Special ADR Rules, review by the Supreme Court of an appeal by
 certiorari, while not a matter of right, may nevertheless be permitted 
under very limited and specific grounds, thus:


RULE 19.36. Review Discretionary. - A review by the Supreme 
Court is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, which 
will be granted only for 
serious and compelling reasons resulting in grave prejudice to the aggrieved party
. The following, while neither controlling nor fully measuring the court's discretion, indicate the serious and compelling, and
necessarily, restrictive nature of the grounds that will warrant the exercise of the Supreme Court's discretionary powers, 
when the Court of Appeals
:


Failed to apply the applicable standard or test for judicial review prescribed in these Special ADK Rules
 in arriving at its decision resulting in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party;


Erred in upholding a final order or decision despite the lack 
of jurisdiction of the court that rendered such final order or decision;


Failed to apply any provision, principle, policy or rule 
contained in these Special ADR Rules resulting in substantial prejudice 
to the aggrieved party; and


Committed an error so egregious and harmful to a party as to amount to an undeniable excess of jurisdiction.


The mere fact that the petitioner disagrees with the Court of Appeals' 
determination of questions of fact, of law or both questions of fact and
 law, shall not warrant the exercise of the Supreme Court's 
discretionary power. 
The error imputed to the Court of Appeals 
must be grounded upon any of the above prescribed grounds for review or 
be closely analogous thereto
.


A mere general allegation that the Court of Appeals has committed 
serious and substantial error or that it has acted with grave abuse of 
discretion resulting in substantial prejudice to the petitioner without 
indicating with specificity the nature of such error or abuse of 
discretion and the serious prejudice suffered by the petitioner on 
account thereof, shall constitute sufficient ground for the Supreme 
Court to dismiss outright the petition. (Emphasis and italics supplied)


The first ground applies here.


To recall, 
G.R. No. 234193
 originated from Special Proceedings 
No. M-7844, which DFNNI filed pursuant to Section 25(a), RA 876 for 
purposes of correcting purported miscalculations in the Arbitral Award. 
The provision ordains:


Section 25. Grounds for modifying or correcting award. - In 
any one of the following cases, the court must make an order modifying 
or correcting the award, upon the application of any party to the 
controversy which was arbitrated:


 
 
(a)
 
Where 
there was an evident miscalculation of figures
, or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award; or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
 
Where
 the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, not 
affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted; or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)
 
Where
 the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of 
the controversy, and if it had been a commissioner's-report, the defect 
could have been amended or disregarded by the court.
 
 


The order may modify and correct the award so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.


The alleged: miscalculated figure DFNNI seeks to correct is the refusal 
of the Arbitration Panel to impose the 2% monthly interest provided in 
Par. 13.2(1) of the ELA, 
viz
.:


On the two percent interest, it is evident that the interest
 referred to unpaid lease rentals. As there are no lease rentals due, 
neither can there be any interest thereon.
[36]


DFNNI, too, seeks an award of temperate damages and attorney's fees. 
We clarify though that the supposed refusal of the Arbitration Panel to 
impose the 2% penalty and DFNNI's claim for the award of temperate 
damages and attorney's fees is not the 
evident miscalculation of figures

 contemplated under Section 25(a), RA 876. To be sure, the provision is 
cut from the same fabric as 9 U.S.C. Â§ 11(a) of the US Federal 
Arbitration Act (FAA):


Section 11, Same; modification or correction; grounds; order, U.S. Federal Arbitration Act.

 In either of the following cases the United States court in and for the
 district wherein the award was made may make an order modifying or 
correcting the award upon the application of any party to the 
arbitration:
 
 
(a)
 
Where there was 
an evident material miscalculation of figures 
or an evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
 
Where
 the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, 
unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the 
matter submitted.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)
 
Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.
 
 


The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.


From a recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals Tenth Circuit,
[37]
 we quote the discussion of the common meaning of 
"evident miscalculation of figures"
 which embodied the so called 
"face-of-the-award limitation"
:
[38]


Let's start with Â§ 11(a)'s plain meaning. See 
Jones v. Comm'r
,
 560 F.3d 196, 1200 (10th Cir. 2009). That section says, in relevant 
part, that a court may modify an award if it contains "an evident 
material miscalculation of figures." 9 U.S.C. Â§ 11(a). 
In ordinarily English, a "miscalculation of figures" refers to mathematical, not legal, errors.
 
See Calculate
,
 NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 242 (2d ed. 2005) ("Determine (the 
amount or number of something) mathematically."); Figure, id. at 626 
(defining "figures" as "arithmetical calculations"). Likewise, 
"material" in this context takes its ordinary meaning of "important; 
essential; relevant." Material, id. at 1045. 
The word "evident," too, takes its ordinary meaning of "plain or obvious.
" 
Evident, id.
 at 585.5 The parties do not appear to dispute the ordinary meaning of these terms. 
See, e.g.
, Mid Atlantic's Opening Br. at 19-21; Ms. Bien & Mr. Wellman's Resp. & Principal Br. at 17. 
Putting these definitions together, we read Â§ 11(a) to allow courts to correct obvious, significant mathematical errors.


But even with these dictionary definitions, the meaning of Â§ 11 (a) â 
particularly the word "evident" â is not clear. Must a miscalculation be
 obvious on the face of the award or must it be obvious after one looks 
to the arbitration record? x x x

x x x x
 
Consider the FAA's purposes.
 
See Abramski v. United States
,
 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (noting the importance of considering a 
statute's textually derived purpose in interpreting a provision). 
Its "'principal purpose' ... is to 'ensur[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms.
'"x x x

x
x x x


Reading this statutory term "evident" as relating to a material 
miscalculation that appears on the face of the award furthers the FAA's 
purposes. A face-of-the-award limitation preserves the integrity of the 
parties' bargain.
 Specifically, it preserves the parties' deal for an arbitrator's, rather than a court's, resolution of their dispute. 
This
 bargain essentially negates the risk that a court may substitute its 
judgment (inadvertently or otherwise) for that of the arbitrator when it
 goes beyond the award's face in search of obvious, material 
mathematical errors. Further, a face-of-the-award approach also ensures 
that arbitration remains an efficient means to resolve disputes rather 
than "merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial 
review process."
 x x x


x x x x


"Evident miscalculation of figures,"
 therefore, 
means obvious mathematical errors that relates to miscalculation that appears on the face of the award
.
 It does not pertain to any allegation of fraud, corruption, or grave 
abuse. It is limited to clerical errors and honest mistake and are, 
thus, correctible insofar as they do not affect the merits of the 
controversy. Such is the restrained attitude that courts were intended 
to maintain with respect to arbitral awards. 
Here, under the guise of correcting an 
"evident miscalculation of figures"
 the RTC-Makati 
reviewed the findings
 of the Arbitration Panel, thus:
[39]


The Court agrees with DFNN[I] that there was an evident 
miscalculation of the figures in the award of damages in favor of 
DFNN[I] contained in the Arbitral A ward. Thus, the Court resolves to 
GRANT the instant Petition.

Section 13.2 of the ELA prescribes the proper computation of liquidated 
damages in case an event of default should occur. Section 13.2 of the 
ELA states:


"(i) PCSO, if it is the party in default, shall pay DFNN[I] 
liquidated
 damages uithe amount (sic) equal to the market value of the System pirn
 rental payments for the unexpired term of this Agreement as provided 
under Section 10.2 and 10.3 hereof, inclusive of a penalty charge of two
 percent (2%) per month on the amount due computed from the date of 
termination or cancellation of the Agreement to the actual date of 
payment.


For the purposes of this provision, "market value" shall be stipulated 
at Twenty Seven Million Pesos (P27,000,000) less depreciation of twelve 
and one half percent (12.5%) per year beginning from execution of this 
Agreement. "Unexpired term of rental payments" shall be computed based 
on the lease charge of five percent (5%) of the total value of bets 
placed through this System provided by DFNN[I] or the amount of Five 
Pesos (P5.00) per successful registrant under the System, whichever is 
higher, at the time such default shall have occurred multiplied by the 
remaining period of the term of this Agreement. PCSO shall also return 
the System to DFNN[I] in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof."


Based on the foregoing-quoted Seetion of the ELA, DFNN[I] claims a total
 amount of Php310,095,149.70 in liquidated damages. The Court agrees 
with this claim.


A reading of the controlling provision in the ELA shows that the two 
percent (2%) penalty charge per month is computed based on "the amount 
due." The amount due in this case refers to the "market value of the 
System plus rental payments for the unexpired term of this Agreement, 
inclusive of a penalty charge of two percent (2%) per month on the 
amount due computed from the date of termination or cancellation of the 
Agreement to the actual date of payment." The Arbitral Tribunal 
determined the amount due to be Php27,000,000.00. 
The 2% penalty charge 
per month should therefore be imposed on the Php27,000,000.00 initially.
 Thereafter, the 2% penalty charge should be computed based on the 
Php27,000,000.00 plus the previously incurred penalty charges. The 
Court[,] therefore[,] corrects the computation of liquidated damages 
(sic) to Php310,095,149.70.
 As to the legal interest that must be imposed on the award, it must be 
noted that the case of 
Nacar vs. Gallery Frames
 (G.R. No. 189871, August 13, 2013) already modified the rates stated in 
Eastern Shipping Lines vs. Court of Appeals

 (G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994) and now prescribes the uniform rate of 
6% legal interest per annum from date of finality of this Decision until
 full satisfaction thereof.


WHEREFORE, premises considered, in accordance with the authority granted
 by Section 11.4(C) of the ADR Rules to this. Court to correct arbitral 
awards, the award for liquidated damages in the Arbitral Award dated May
 21, 2015 is hereby corrected to Php310,095149.70, plus 6% interest from
 [date] of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction thereof.

SO ORDERED."


Clearly, the-RTC-Makati passed off its decision as mere correction of 
the Arbitral Award. But in truth, it reversed and set aside the findings
 of the Arbitration Panel with respect to the 2% penalty provided in 
Par. 13.2(i) of the ELA, substituting its decision for that of the 
Arbitration Panel. 

In 
Fruehauf Electronics Philippines Corporation v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation
,
[40]
 this Court explained the basic principles surrounding an arbitral award:


Arbitration is an alternative mode of dispute resolution 
outside of the regular court system
.
 Although adversarial in character, arbitration is technically not 
litigation. It is a voluntary process in which one or more arbitrators â
 appointed according to the parties' agreement or according to the 
applicable rules of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Law â 
resolve a dispute by rendering an award.
[41]

 While arbitration carries many advantages over court litigation, in 
many ways these advantages also translate into its disadvantages.

Resort to arbitration is voluntary. It requires 
consent from both parties
 in the form of an arbitration clause that 
pre-existed the dispute or a subsequent submission agreement
.
 This written arbitration agreement is an independent and legally 
enforceable contract that must be complied with in good faith. By 
entering into an arbitration agreement, the parties agree to submit 
their dispute to an arbitrator (or tribunal) of their own choosing and 
be bound by the latter's resolution.

However, this 
contractual
 and 
consensual
 character means 
that the parties cannot implead a third-party in the proceedings even if
 the latter's participation is necessary for a complete settlement of 
the dispute. The tribunal does not have the power to compel a person to 
participate in the arbitration proceedings without that person's 
consent. It also has no authority to decide on issues that the parties 
did not submit (or agree to submit) for its resolution.

As a 
purely private mode of dispute resolution
, arbitration 
proceedings, including the records, the evidence, and the arbitral 
award, are confidential unlike court proceedings which are generally 
public. This allows the parties to avoid negative publicity and protect 
their privacy. Our law highly regards the confidentiality of arbitration
 proceedings that it devised a judicial remedy to prevent or prohibit 
the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information obtained 
therefrom.

The contractual nature of arbitral proceedings affords the parties 
substantial 
autonomy over the proceedings
. 
The parties are free to agree 
on the procedure to be observed

 during the proceedings. This lends considerable flexibility to 
arbitration proceedings as compared to court litigation governed by the 
Rules of Court.

The parties likewise 
appoint the arbitrators
 based on agreement. 
There are no other legal requirements as to the competence or technical 
qualifications of an arbitrator. Their only legal qualifications are: 
(1) being of legal age: (2) full-enjoyment of their civil rights; and 
(3) the ability to read and write. The parties can tailor-fit the 
tribunal's composition to the nature of their dispute. Thus, a 
specialized dispute can be resolved by experts on the subject.

However, because arbitrators do not necessarily have a background in 
law, they cannot be expected to have the legal mastery of a magistrate. 
There is a greater risk that an arbitrator might misapply the law or 
misappreciate the facts 
en route
 erroneous decision.


This 
risk of error
 is compounded by the absence of an effective appeal mechanism. 
The errors of an arbitral tribunal are not subject to correction by the judiciary.

 As a private alternative to court proceedings, arbitration is meant to 
be an end, not the beginning, of litigation. Thus, the arbitral award is
 final and binding on the parties by reason of their contract the 
arbitration agreement.
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)


In other words, a party may not invoke the grounds for correction of 
arbitral awards under Section 25(a), RA 876, including the correction of
 "evident miscalculation of figures", as a ruse to ask for a review of 
the substantive findings of an arbitral tribunal. The mere fact that a 
party disagrees with the arbitral tribunal's factual findings and legal 
conclusions does not warrant the modification or correction of the 
arbitral award, much less a review thereof. 
All told, the Court of Appeals gravely erred when it affirmed the ruling
 of the RTC-Makati which granted DFNNI's petition for correction. PCSO's
 liability to DFNNI must be set at P27,000,000.00 of liquidated damages 
in accordance with the Arbitral Award.

York's arbitration statute.... The New York Arbitration Law incorporated
 pre-existing provisions of the New York Code of Civil Procedure."). 
Section 11(a)'s text, in particular, was "virtually identical" to New 
York's provision in effect in 1925.

AIG Baker
,
 508 F.3d at 1000 ("The language of section 11 (a) of the federal Act 
matched almost verbatim the language of section 2375 of the New York 
Code of Civil Procedure, which had long been a part of New York law and 
the New York Arbitration Law incorporated by reference,"). That 
provision allowed courts to modify an arbitration award to correct "an 
evident miscalculation of figures." N.Y. CODE CIV. P. Â§ 2375 (Frank B. 
Gilbert & Austin B. Griffin 1920).

By the time Congress transplanted that language into Â§11(a), New York 
courts had long interpreted the language "an evident miscalculation of 
figures" to mean a miscalculation that appeared in the award "on its 
face."

would have been different" (quoting

276, 280 (N.Y. 1889))); see also AIG Baker, 508 F.3d at 1001 (collecting
 New York cases showing that this reading has "been part of New York 
jurisprudence for many years").

The face-of-the-award limitation therefore "was part of the 'old soil'" 
that Â§ 11(a) brought with it from New York law. 
AIG Baker
, 508 F.3d at 1001. Over the intervening decades, Congress has left the "evident material miscalculation" language untouched. "

been old soil attached to Â§ 11(a).

CONCURRING OPINION


PERLAS-BERNABE, 
J
.:


I concur.

The petition in 
G.R. No. 234193
 should be granted since the Court
 of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. SP No. 145983, erred in affirming the 
Makati Regional Trial Court's
[1]

 (RTC) increase of the Arbitral Award dated May 21, 2015 (Arbitral 
Award) on the ground of "evident miscalculation of figures." As the 
ponencia

 correctly observed, such ground must relate to obvious mathematical 
errors and miscalculation appearing on the face of the awardâa situation
 that does not obtain here as the RTC effectively used this ground to 
amend the Arbitration Panel's substantive findings.
[2]
 

In the same vein, the petition in 
G.R. No. 232801
 should likewise be 
granted since the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 145462, erred in ordering the 
Mandaluyong RTC
[3]
 to 
consolidate petitioner Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office's (PCSO) 
Petition for Confirmation with respondent DFNN, Inc.'s (DFNNI) Petition 
for Correction filed before the Makati RTC.

To expound, the rationale for consolidation is to have all intimately 
related cases acted upon by one branch of the court to avoid the 
possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered, and in effect, 
prevent confusion, unnecessary costs, and delay. However, an essential 
requisite of consolidation is that the actions to be consolidated are 
pending before the court
.
[4]
 

In this case, records show that at the time that the Mandaluyong RTC 
resolved DFNNI's motion seeking to consolidate the Petition for 
Confirmation filed before it with the Petition for Correction filed by 
DFNNI in the Makati RTC, the Makati RTC had already rendered a judgment 
in the petition before it. Hence, there was no more pending case before 
the Makati RTC which could be consolidated.


To briefly recount the events, on June 25, 2015, PCSO filed a Petition 
for Confirmation of the Arbitral Award before the Mandaluyong RTC, while
 DFNNI filed a Petition for Correction of the same award with the Makati
 RTC a day after.
[5]
 
DFNNI subsequently filed a Motion for Consolidation
[6]

 dated July 16, 2015 under Rule 11.5 of the Special Rules of Court on 
Alternative Dispute Resolution before the Mandaluyong RTC seeking to 
consolidate both petitions in the Makati RTC. 


While this motion was pending, the Makati RTC already rendered a Decision
[7]
 dated February 17, 2016
, granting 
DFNNI's petition and increasing the arbitral award
 as above-stated. The ruling of the Makati RTC was then elevated to
[8]
 and, thereupon, affirmed by the CA,
[9]
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 145983. The CA's ruling, in turn, was elevated to this Court, via the present petition in 
G.R. No. 234193
. 
Considering the ruling of the Makati RTC at that time, the Mandaluyong RTC thus issued an Order
[10]
 dated April 11, 2016 
denying DFNNI's Motion for Consolidation
.
 Aside from ruling that the use of the word "may" in Rule 11.5 indicates
 the permissive and discretionary nature of consolidation, it found that
 since the Makati RTC had already rendered a decision in the Petition 
for Correction, consolidation will unduly delay the disposition of the 
cases and burden the court.
[11]
 The proceedings continued, culminating in a Decision
[12]

 dated January 5, 2017, rendered by the Mandaluyong RTC confirming the 
Arbitral Award. 

The foregoing notwithstanding, the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 145462, granted
 DFFNI's appeal against the denial of its motion for consolidation. In a
 Decision
[13]
 dated February 
20, 2017, the CA held that consolidation was proper, and thus, ordered 
the Mandaluyong RTC to consolidate its case with the petition before the
 Makati RTC.
[14]
 Glaringly, however, the CA ruling was silent as to the ground that prompted the Mandaluyong RTC to deny consolidation, 
i.e.
,
 that the Makati RTC had already rendered a judgment in
the correction case. Moreover, it should be pointed out that at the time
 that the CA ordered consolidation in CA-G.R. SP No. 145462, the 
Mandaluyong RTC had already rendered a Decision
[15]
 dated January 5, 2017, granting PCSO's petition for confirmation of Arbitral Award. 

Given the trajectory of events, the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 145462, erred in still ordering consolidation despite the fact that 
(a)

 during the pendency of the motion for consolidation before the 
Mandaluyong RTC, the Makati RTC had already rendered judgment in the 
correction case; and 
(b)
 during the pendency of the petition 
before it, the Mandaluyong RTC had also rendered a judgment in the 
confirmation case. Accordingly, the purpose sought to be achieved by 
consolidating the petitions would not be any more subserved since the 
proceedings before the Makati RTC had already been terminated, leaving 
no avenue for both petitions to be jointly tried in an effort to 
abbreviate and simplify the proceedings. Thus, considering the 
circumstances under which the Mandaluyong RTC disposed of DFNNTs motion 
for consolidation, the said court had no other choice but to deny the 
motion filed before it.


In fine, as ruled by the 
ponencia
, the petitions in 
G.R. No. 232801 and G.R. No. 234193
 should be both granted. The foregoing dispositions will thus yield the following practical result: pursuant to the Decision
[16]
 dated January 5, 2017 of the Mandaluyong RTC granting the petition for confirmation and pursuant to this Court's holding in 
G.R. No. 234193
 that correction is improper, 
the Arbitral Award between the parties will therefore stand confirmed
. Meanwhile, since the only issue involving the Mandaluyong RTC, as elevated in 
G.R. No. 232801
,
 is the propriety of consolidation and no other, DFNNI is free to pursue
 any other remedy available to it under the law against the arbitral 
award's confirmation.
