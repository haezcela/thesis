THE CASES
 

In their separate petitions for review on 
certiorari
, Ronald O. Martinez and twenty-seven (27) others
[1]
 (Martinez, 
et al.
) on the one hand, 
and


Magnolia Poultry Processing Plant, now named San Miguel Foods, Inc. 
(SMFI-MPPP), on the other, assail the following dispositions of the 
Court of Appeals in CA â G.R. SP No. 129575
[2]
 entitled 
"Ronald O. Martinez, et al. v. National Labor Relations Commission (5
th

 Division), Magnolia Poultry Processing Plant (MPPP) now named San 
Miguel Foods, Inc., (SMFI) â MPPP, and ROMAC Services and Trading Co., 
Inc."
:


 
 
1) 
 
Decision
[3]
 dated April 29, 2016 
declaring Romac as a labor-only contractor, and Martinez, 
et 
al
. as regular employees of SMFI-MPPP, but denying their claim
 for CBA benefits and damages; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)
 
Resolution
[4]
 dated May 9, 2017 
denying the respective motions for reconsideration of Martinez, 

et al.
, SMFI-MPPP, and Romac.
 
 


Antecedents


In their Amended Complaint
[5]
 dated August 23, 2010, Ronald O. Martinez and the initial twenty-five (25) other employees
[6]
 filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with other monetary claims
[7]

 against SMFI-MPPP and Romac Services and Trading Co. Inc. (Romac). On 
September 30, 2010, two (2) others, namely: Roel M. Gutierrez and 
Ernesto IÃ±osa filed a similar complaint.
[8]
 The two (2) cases were subsequently consolidated per Order
[9]
dated October 15, 2010. 


Martinez, et al.
 alleged that on separate dates, they were
 hired by Romac as daily paid rank and file employees assigned at the 
production department of SMFI-MPPP in Quebiawan, San Fernando City, 
Pampanga. Romac though did not have a business distinct and separate 
from that of SMFI-MPPP. 
As members of the sanitation crew assigned at the production department,
 they performed tasks necessary and desirable to the poultry business of
 SMFI-MPPP 
i.e.
, receiving-dressing, packaging, slitter, stunner,
 blood vat, scalder, head puller, deboning, chicken fat remover, crates 
sanitizer, crates cleaner, filer, stocker, hanger, inspector, feeder, 
and transporter. The sanitation aspect though only accounted for 30% of 
their tasks as they were mainly utilized at the production line of 
SMFI-MPPP.


In the performance of these tasks, they were closely monitored by 
regular supervisory employees of SMFI-MPPP such as Gilbert Espino, Caloy
 Castor, Danilo Aguilar, Noel Guerrero, and Joseph Zapata. To ensure the
 quality of its products, SMFI-MPPP periodically trained them through 
seminars on Basic Poultry Operations, Good Manufacturing Practices, 
Sanitation, and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
Overview.


They regularly reported for work until January 4, 2010, when most of 
them were no longer allowed inside the premises of SMFI-MPPP because it 
had ceased operations preparatory to its intended outsourcing of 
services. Thus, they got constrained to file the case for illegal 
dismissal with monetary claims against SMFI-MPPP and Romac. 
As regular employees of SMFI-MPPP, they are entitled to the benefits 
under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between SMFI-MPPP and 
SMFI-MPPP Workers Union (SMFI-MPPPWU-Daily).

Records show that Edgardo Villavicencio
[10]
 died on September 19, 2010 while Jannel Lord Bondoc
[11]
 died on June 21, 2011. 


SMFI-MPPP
,
[12]
 on the 
other hand, countered that it is engaged in the business of poultry, 
meat, animal feeds, and veterinary medicines. To maximize efficiency and
 cost-effectiveness, beginning December 1, 1994, it entered into a 
contract of services with Romac for the performance of peripheral and 
ancillary tasks pertaining to its poultry business, 
i.e.
, 
sanitation, maintenance, janitorial, housekeeping, and reliever services
 in times of demand upsurge. Romac, thus, deployed its own employees to 
perform these contracted services at the company's processing plant in 
San Fernando, Pampanga. 

As early as 2007, it already contemplated on the closure of its Pampanga
 Plant in anticipation of its plan to cede the same to a third party. 
But in consideration of the numerous employees who would be affected by 
the closure, the same was deferred for some time and got implemented 
only in December of 2009.


Contrary to the position of Martinez, 
et al.
, the fact that 
SMFI-MPPP required them to attend seminars on Basic Poultry Operations, 
Good Manufacturing Practices, Sanitation, and HACCP Overview did not 
prove the existence of an employer-employee relationship between them. 
It required attendance to these seminars as part of its accreditation 
requirements. As Romac's regular employees, Martinez, 
et al
. had no right to claim benefits under the CBA between SMFI-MPPP and SMFI-MPPPWU-Daily.
[13]
 

For its part, 
Romac
[14]
 acknowledged that it had a 
contractual
 (fixed period) employer-employee relationship with Martinez, 
et al
.
 It was initially registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC) on June 26, 1989 to engage and operate in the business of 
contracting for general building maintenance and cleaning services, 
furnishing skilled and semi-skilled manpower services which include 
janitorial, messengerial, and driver services.
[15]
 

In compliance with Department Order No. (DO) 10, series of 1997, it 
registered as a legitimate job contractor with the Department of Labor 
and Employment (DOLE) per Certificate of Registration No. R03-9709-006; 
and under DO 18-02, series of 2002 per Certificate of Registration No. 
III-O93-0502-006. It had substantial capital and investment in the form 
of tools, equipment, work premises, and other materials necessary for 
the conduct of its business as legitimate job contractor.


In 1994, it entered into two (2) service contracts with SMFI-MPPP - 
Contract for Sanitation, Maintenance, Janitorial, and Housekeeping 
Services and a Contract for Substitute or Reliever Services. Pursuant to
 these contracts, it designated Martinez, 
et al
. to work at the SMFI-MPPP plant in San Fernando City, Pampanga. There, Martinez, 
et al
. worked under the direct control and supervision of Licerio Araza, supervisory personnel of Romac.


As fixed period employees, Martinez, 
et al
. should not be 
accorded regular or permanent status either by Romac or SMFI-MPPP. Upon 
the termination of its service contracts with SMFI-MPPP, it offered to 
transfer Martinez, 
et al.
, to other assignments, but they 
refused, insisting they were SMFI-MPPP's regular employees. There could 
be no illegal dismissal to speak of simply because what took place was a
 mere expiration of the service contracts for which Martinez, 
et al
., got employed.
[16]


Ruling of the Labor Arbiter


By Decision
[17]
 dated August 4, 2011, Labor Arbiter Reynaldo V. Abdon declared that Martinez, 
et al
. were illegally dismissed, Romac was a labor-only contractor, and that the actual employer of Martinez, 
et al
. was SMFI-MPPP, thus:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered 
DECLARING that respondent ROMAC SERVICES AND TRADING, INC. is a 
labor-only contractor and that respondent SAN MIGUEL FOODS, INC. 
(MAGNOLIA POULTRY PROCESSING PLANT) is the true employer of the 
complainants.
It is also DECLARED that complainants are deemed regular employees of 
the respondent San Miguel Foods, Inc. Consequently, complainants are 
within the scope of coverage of Magnolia Poultry Processing Plant Daily 
Union (PTGWO) Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with SMFI.

IT IS FURTHER DECLARED that complainants were illegally dismissed by 
respondents. Accordingly, respondent SAN MIGUEL FOODS, INC. (MAGNOLIA 
PROCESSING PLANT) is hereby ORDERED to reinstate the complainants to 
their former job positions without loss of seniority rights and 
benefits.

Moreover, respondents ROMAC SERVICES AND TRADING, INC. and SAN MIGUEL 
CORPORATION, INC. are jointly and severally DIRECTED [to] pay the 
complainants their full backwages and other benefits from the date of 
dismissal until they are reinstated, the grand total amount at present 
is Four Million Six Hundred Eighty One Thousand Seven Hundred Seventy 
Two and Seventy Six Centavos (Php4,681,772.76).

Additionally, respondents are jointly and severally ORDERED to pay the 
complainants ten percent (10%) of their monetary award as attorney's 
fees, in the sum of Four Hundred Sixty Eight Thousand One Hundred 
Seventy Seven and Twenty Seven Centavos (Php 468,177.27).
The Report of the Fiscal Examiner on the computation of the 
complainants' monetary awards is hereto attached as Annex "A" and made 
an integral part of this decision.


Finally, the reinstatement aspect of this Decision is immediately 
executory. Hence, respondent San Miguel Foods, Inc. is DIRECTED to 
submit Compliance Report to this Office as regards the reinstatement of 
complainants within twenty (20) days from receipt of this decision.

Claims for moral and exemplary damages are dismissed for lack of merit.

Claims for monetary benefits under the present CBA is also denied for 
lack of basis.
 
SO ORDERED.


Appeals to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)


Martinez, 
et al.
, SMFI-MPPP, and Romac filed their respective appeals before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).


Martinez, 
et al.
, faulted the labor arbiter for denying their claims for CBA benefits and damages.
[18]


SMFI-MPPP, on the other hand, faulted the labor arbiter for holding that Romac was a labor-only contractor and that Martinez, 
et al
. were regular employees of SMFI-MPPP. It emphasized that Martinez, 
et al
.
 did not perform acts necessary and desirable to its main business of 
poultry supply. For lack of employer-employee relationship between the 
company and these individuals, it cannot be held liable for Martinez, 
et al.'s
 complaint for illegal dismissal and money claims.
[19]
 

Romac, for its part, reiterated that it is a legitimate labor contractor
 and that it had an employment contract with SMFI-MPPP for a specific 
period which already expired. There could be no illegal dismissal to 
speak of when what took place was a mere expiration of the service 
contracts for which Martinez, 
et al
. were employed.
[20]


Dispositions of the NLRC


By Resolution dated December 15, 2011, the NLRC initially dismissed the 
respective appeals of SMFI-MPPP and Romac. It noted that the joint 
declaration attached to the appeal bond of SMFI-MPPP was not signed by 
the bonding company while the appeal of Romac did not bear any bond at 
all in violation of Section 6, Rule VI of the NLRC Rules of Procedure.
[21]


SMFI-MPPP, thus, promptly submitted the required joint declaration duly 
signed by Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc. Vice-President Guia 
Laguio-Flaminiano. As for Romac, it submitted a manifestation that the 
common bond attached to the memorandum of appeal of SMFI-MPPP actually 
pertained to both of them.
[22]
 Finding these submissions to be in order, the NLRC reinstated their respective appeals.

By Decision
[23]
 dated September 13, 2012, the NLRC reversed in this wise, 
viz
.:


x x x Romac x x x is a legitimate labor contractor. 
Respondent Romac is the complainants' employer, and not San Miguel.


Complainants were assigned to San Miguel pursuant to two contracts of: 
1) Sanitation[,] Maintenance[,] Janitorial[,] and Housekeeping Services,
 and 2) Reliever Services. The services they rendered were maintenance 
and janitorial services, a job not necessary or desirable to the poultry
 business of San Miguel. x x x

Considering that there is absence of employer-employee relationship, San
 Miguel cannot be held guilty of illegal dismissal. Neither can it 
accord regular employment status to complainants, nor pay their 
backwages and attorney's fees.

Complainants are the contractual employees of Romac, as shown in the 
employment contracts for fixed periods. When the contracts of services 
entered in by and between San Miguel and Romac expired, the assignment 
of the complainants to San Miguel also ended.

x x x x

Thus, there is no illegal dismissal to speak of. The complainants are 
not entitled to backwages, damages[,] nor attorney's fees. Romac was 
transferring them to CCPI-SFD, but complainants refused.

x x x x

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeals of San Miguel and Romac 
Services are 
GRANTED.
 The appeal of the complainants is 
DISMISSED.


The Decision appealed from is 
VACATED
, and a new one issued 
DISMISSING
 the complaint.

SO ORDERED.
[24]


The motion for reconsideration of Martinez, 
et al
., was subsequently denied per Resolution
[25]
 dated January 25, 2013.


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


On a petition for 
certiorari
 initiated by Martinez, 
et al
. in CA â G.R. SP No. 129575, the Court of Appeals, by Decision
[26]
 dated April 29, 2016, nullified the dispositions of the NLRC and reinstated the ruling of the labor arbiter, 
viz
.:


x x x As correctly found by the Labor Arbiter, respondent Romac was a labor-only contractor.

x x x x


First
, respondent Romac had no substantial capital.

x x x x


Second
, respondent Romac supplied petitioners to respondent SMFI,
 to perform activities which were directly related to respondent SMFI's 
main business.

Petitioners' work in ensuring the sanitation and maintenance of the 
equipment, was directly related to the chicken poultry business of 
respondent SMFI. Petitioners' jobs of sanitation and maintenance, were 
necessary and desirable in the day-to-day operations of respondent 
SMFI's business. Notably, petitioners had been performing the same tasks
 regularly, within respondent SMFI's plant, for long periods of time. 
This was sufficient evidence of the indispensability of petitioners' 
jobs to respondent SMFI's business.


Third
, respondent Romac did not exercise the right to control 
over the performance of work of the petitioners. Rather, it was 
respondent SMFI that exercised the power of control over the petitioners
 in the performance of their work.

x x x x

With respect to the final issue, we rule in the affirmative. Petitioners
 were entitled to their money claims.

x x x x

We 
SET ASIDE
 the Decision dated 13 September 2012, and the 
Resolution dated 25 January 2013, both issued by the National Labor 
Relations Commission, and we 
REINSTATE
 the Decision dated 4 August 2011 issued by the Labor Arbiter.


IT IS SO ORDERED.
[27]


The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration on May 9, 2017.
[28]


The Present Petitions


Both Martinez, 
et al
. and SMFI-MPPP now seek affirmative relief through their respective petitions for review on 
certiorari
.

In G.R. No. 231579, 
Martinez, 
et al
.
 assert anew that they
 are entitled to backwages and differential benefits pursuant to the CBA
 of the regular rank-and-file employees of SMFI-MPPP for three (3) years
 prior to their illegal dismissal, plus damages.
[29]


In G.R. No. 231636, 
SMFI-MPPP
[30]

 maintains that the contracts of service it entered into with Romac were
 valid and that the latter is a legitimate job contractor with 
substantial capitalization and investment. In 2001 alone, Romac had an 
authorized capital stock of P20,000,000.00. Romac hired and paid the 
salaries and benefits of Martinez, 
et al
., and held the power to discipline and fire them. While performing their duties within the premises of SMFI-MPPP, Martinez, 
et al
.
 were under the direct control and supervision of Licerio Araza, a 
supervisory employee of Romac. SMFI-MPPP, therefore, could not have 
illegally dismissed Martinez, 
et al
., who are, in fact, employees
 of Romac, nor could be made liable for the reinstatement of these 
employees and payment of their money claims.

Both petitioners, thereafter, filed their respective comments, 
reiterating the arguments in their petitions.


Core Issue


Is Romac a legitimate labor contractor or a labor-only contractor?


Ruling


Preliminarily, the Court notes that the core issue is a purely factual 
issue which the Court does not generally entertain. For the Court is not
 a trier of facts and does not normally embark in the evaluation of 
evidence adduced during the trial. This rule, however, admits of 
exceptions. One of them is when the factual findings of the 
quasi-judicial agencies concerned are conflicting or contradictory with 
those of the Court of Appeals, as here. Under this circumstance, it 
becomes the duty of the Court to re-examine the records and draw its own
 factual findings.
[31]


We now resolve the cases on the merits.

Article 106 of the Labor Code proscribes the practice of labor-only contracting, 
viz
.:


ARTICLE 106.
 
Contractor or Subcontractor
. â 
Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the 
performance of the former's work, the employees of the contractor and of
 the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with 
the provisions of this Code.

In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages
 of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be 
jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to 
such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, 
in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly 
employed by him.

The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, 
restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights 
of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or 
restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only 
contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these
 types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall
 be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any 
violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.

There is "labor-only" contracting where the person supplying workers to 
an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form 
of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the 
workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities 
which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. 
In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as 
an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the 
same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him.
[32]


As a general rule, a contractor is presumed to be a labor-only 
contractor, unless such contractor overcomes the burden of proving that 
it has substantial capital, investment, tools, and the like.
[33]

 As a regulated industry, the law requires registration of labor 
contractors with the DOLE. Failure to register shall give rise to the 
presumption that the contractor is engaged in labor-only contracting.

Section 5 in relation to Section 11 of DO 18-02
[34]
 governed the registration of labor contractors at the time material to the cases at bar, thus:


SECTION 5. 
Prohibition against labor-only contracting
.
 â Labor-only contracting is hereby declared prohibited. For this 
purpose, labor-only contracting shall refer to an arrangement where the 
contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers 
to perform a job, work or service for a principal, and any of the 
following elements are present:

i) The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or 
investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and
 the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or 
subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to 
the main business of the principal; or

ii) the contractor does not exercise the right to control over the 
performance of the work of the contractual employee.

The foregoing provisions shall be without prejudice to the application 
of Article 248 (c) of the Labor Code, as amended.

"Substantial capital or investment" refers to capital stocks and 
subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, tools, equipment,
 implements, machineries and work premises, actually and directly used 
by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of 
the job, work or service contracted out.

The "right to control" shall refer to the right reserved to the person 
for whom the services of the contractual workers are performed, to 
determine not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means
 to be used in reaching that end.
[35]


x x x x


SECTION 11.
 
Registration of Contractors or Subcontractors
.
 â Consistent with the authority of the Secretary of Labor and 
Employment to restrict or prohibit the contracting out of labor through 
appropriate regulations, a registration system to govern contracting 
arrangements and to be implemented by the Regional Offices is hereby 
established.

The registration of contractors and subcontractors shall be necessary 
for purposes of establishing an effective labor market information and 
monitoring.


Failure to register shall give rise to the presumption that the contractor is engaged in labor-only contracting.
[36]
 (Emphases supplied)


Here, there is no dispute that Romac held the Certificate of Registration No. III-O93-0502-006
[37]
 as a legitimate and independent labor contractor per DO 18-02, 
viz
.:


Republic of the Philippines

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT

City of San Fernando, Pampanga


This

CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION

No. III-O93-0502-006

TIN: 
000-267-578-000


is issued to


ROMAC SERVICES & TRADING CO., INC.

776 Sto. Rosario St., Sto. Domingo, Angeles City


For having complied with the requirements as provided in the Labor Code,
 as amended, and its Implementing Rules and having paid the registration
 fee in the amount of ONE HUNDRED PESOS (P 100.00) per Official Receipt 
No. 5226437 dated 23 May 2008.
In witness whereof, and by the authority vested in me by the Labor Code,
 as amended, its Implementing Rules[,] specifically Department Order No.
 18-02, Series of 2002 entitled Rules Implementing Articles 106 to 109 
of the Labor Code[,] as amended, I have hereto set my hand and affixed 
the Official Seal of Department of Labor and Employment, Regional Office
 No. Ill, City of San Fernando, Pampanga on this 23
rd
 day of 
May 2008.

This Certificate of Registration shall be valid until 07 May 2011 
subject for renewal every three (3) years pursuant to Section 17 of DO 
18Â­02, Series of 2002 unless, sooner cancelled by the Regional Director.

Signed

NATHANIEL V. LACAMBRA

Regional Director


As the primary agency tasked to regulate job contracting, DOLE is 
presumed to have regularly performed its official duty when it declared 
that Romac had complied with the requirements of the Labor Code and its 
implementing rules, and based thereon, conferred upon it the 
corresponding certificate of registration as a legitimate and 
independent labor contractor.
[38]


We keenly note that the aforesaid certification was not the first but 
already the second certification issued by the DOLE conferring Romac the
 status of a legitimate labor contractor. The first was issued by the 
DOLE pursuant to DO 10, series of 1997.
[39]
 Further, since 1989, Romac has been in the roster of duly registered corporations with the SEC, bearing SEC Reg. No. 165092.
[40]
 
The Court though recognizes that the presumption of legitimacy arising 
from one's registration as an independent and legitimate labor 
contractor may be defeated whenever it is shown that:


i) The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial
 capital or investment which relates to the job, work, or service to be 
performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such 
contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly
 related to the main business of the principal; or

ii) the contractor does not exercise the right to control over the 
performance of the work of the contractual employee.
[41]


Substantial capital or investment refers to "capital stocks and 
subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, tools, equipment,
 implements, machineries, and work premises, actually and directly used 
by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of 
the job, work, or service contracted out."
[42]

 As to how much or what constitutes substantial capital, DO 18-A, series
 of 2011 dated November 14,2011 defines substantial capital as paid-up 
capital stocks/shares of at least P3,000,000.00 in the case of 
corporations.


Here, in 2001 alone, Romac already had on record a capital stock of 
P20,000,000.00
[43]
 and 
ownership of an office building, a commercial lot, various office 
equipment, furniture and fixtures, communication equipment, various 
service vehicles, and janitorial tools and equipment.
[44]

 Verily, Romac had sufficient capital to carry on its independent 
on-going business as a legitimate contractor or provider of services to 
its various clients, including SMFI-MPPP pursuant to the standard of 
substantial capital under DO 18-A.


Another. It is a matter of record that apart from SMFI-MPPP, Romac also 
supplies services to its several other A-list clients such as Jollibee 
Foods Corporation, GMA Network â Regional TV, University of Santo Tomas 
Hospital, Philamlife Insurance Company, Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, 
Inc., and Cosmos Bottling Corporation. In 
San Miguel Foods, Inc. v. Rivera
,
[45]

 the Court held that the A-list clients listed in the roster of the 
labor contractor apart from petitioner, which incidentally is the same 
company involved here, strongly indicates that the concerned labor 
contractor carried on a legitimate and independent business operations 
distinct from the operations of petitioner itself.


As for the element of control, we shall discuss it in light of the 
fourÂ­fold test: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) 
the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) 
the power of control.


First. 
On different dates, Romac engaged Martinez, 
et al
. as evidenced by the latter's respective Personnel Appointments/Employment Contracts printed on Romac's own letterhead.
[46]


Second.
 In both contracts for Sanitation, Maintenance, 
Janitorial, and Housekeeping Services and for Substitute or Reliever 
Services which Romac entered into with SMFI-MPPP, Romac unconditionally 
assumed the obligation to pay the salaries and other statutory benefits 
of Martinez, 
et al., viz
.:


SECTION 5. CONTRACTOR'S COVENANTS â
 CONTRACTOR further covenants and agrees to:


x x x x
 
 
(i) 
 
While
 this Agreement, or any extension thereof, is in effect, pay the wages 
or salaries of its employees, personnel[,] and agents, as well as all 
benefits, premiums [,] and protection, in accordance with all applicable
 laws, rules[,] and regulations, and DOLE DO's, and furnish CLIENT, on 
or before the tenth (10
th
) day of every month, a 
sworn certification stating that: (i) CONTRACTOR has paid all wages and 
salaries due to the workers for all services rendered by them during the
 immediately preceding month, including overtime, if any, and such other
 payments and benefits as are required under the Labor Code of the 
Philippines, SSS Law [sic], and other laws or regulations relating to 
the Home Development Mutual Fund, PhilHealth, [sic] Employees 
Compensation Commission, and the like, (ii) that such payments were all 
in accordance with the requirements of law, and (iii) that remittances 
required to be made to the Bureau of Internal Revenue on behalf of its 
employees have been made for the subject reporting period; x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 


True to its undertaking, Romac paid the monthly salary and labor standard benefits to Martinez, 
et al
. and effected the statutory deductions on their salaries, as shown by the employees' payslips bearing the logo of Romac. 
Third.
 The power of Romac to hire included its inherent power to discipline Martinez, 
et al
.
[47]

 In one instance, Romac found Benedicto Miranda guilty of simple 
negligence in the performance of his janitorial task inside the premises
 of SMFI-MPPP, 
viz
.:


Romac Services & Trading Company, Inc.

Disciplinary Action Form


Violator's Name: Benedicto O. Miranda
 Dept./Project: SMFI-MPPP

x x x x


Nature of Offense: Negligence

Date of Commission: October 16, 2007

Date Served: October 19, 2007

Due to your violation of the company Rules & Regulations x x x : 
Acts of Negligence in the performance of duties or in the care and use 
of the company property, equipment[,] or device. (Simple Negligence: 
Failure to observe diligence demand[ed] by the situation thereby 
exposing the company to unnecessary risk.)


In his explanation letter. Miranda denied the charge:


"Ako po si Benedicto Miranda, janitor[-]sweeper sa 
[building] B. Kinuha ko yung basura sa holding return na nasa anim na 
crates po [ijyon itinaob ko langpo sa drum. Hindi ko po alam na may 
manokpo yung mga basura na nasa crates. Itinapon ko na po sa may 
basurahan. Ang mali ko lang po[J hindi ako nakapag[-]log book

Signed

Benedicto Miranda
[
48]


Romac eventually suspended Miranda for fourteen (14) working days.

In another instance, Bienvenido Millan, Jr. was caught punching in another employee's timecard. He reasoned out:


Ako si Bienvenido Millan, Jr., sumulat po ako para 
humingi ng tawad sa nagawa kong kamalian. [H]indi na po mauulit [i]yon. 
Sa totoo lang p[o, napag-utusan lang po ako ng [l]eadman ko na i-[punch]
 ang time card nya. [S}umunod naman ako dahil siya ang leadman ko at 
saka baka pag-initan niya ako kung hindi ako susunod sa kanya. [M]ahal 
ko po ang trabaho ko. [D]ito ko po binubuhay ang pamilya ko. Kaya lang 
nagkamali ako sa pagsunod sa leadman ko. Pero ipangako ko sa inyo na 
hindi na mauulit [i]yon. Pagbutihan ko ang trabaho ko hanggang sa 
makakaya ko.


Signed

Bienvenido Millan
[49]


Romac, too, eventually suspended Bienvenido and even instructed him to 
first report to Romac Corporate Office after serving his suspension for 
further instruction:


The ROMAC GROUP

Romac Services & Trading Co., Inc.


To: Bienvenido D. Millan, Jr.

Utility

From: Human Resources Department

Date: June 10, 2009

Re: Suspension


We would like to inform you that in relation to your suspension 
regarding the punching log in of other employees[,] we would extend your
 suspension starting June 8 up to June 14, 2009.

We would also like to inform you that after the exclusive dates of your 
suspension, you should first report to Romac Corporate office on june 
15, 2009 for farther instruction.

For your strict compliance.
 Received

Bienvenido Millan, Jr.
 June 11, 20 09
[50]


Significantly, Martinez, 
et al
. invariably recognized and 
respected the authority of Romac to impose disciplinary sanctions on 
them for their individual infractions for the entire duration of their 
employment with the latter, specifically during their assignment at 
SMFI-MPPP. 


Fourth.
 Among the four-fold test, 
control
 is the most 
important. Under the control test, an employer-employee relationship 
exists if the "employer" has reserved the right to control the 
"employee" not only as to the result of the work done but also as to the
 means and methods by which the same is to be accomplished. Otherwise, 
no such relationship exists.
[51]


Records show that it was Romac which exercised control over Martinez, 
et al
.
 To recall, these employees applied with and were hired by Romac, as 
evidenced by their individual employment contracts printed on the 
letterhead of Romac. It was Romac which paid the wages and other labor 
standard benefits of these employees, as shown by their payrolls and 
disbursement vouchers. More, it was Romac which reported them as its 
employees to the Social Security System (SSS), Employees Compensation 
Commission (ECC), and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation 
(PhilHealth), among others. It was also Romac which made the necessary 
deductions on their salaries and the proper remittance thereof to these 
agencies. Further, Romac exercised the power to dismiss and discipline 
as heretofore shown. Finally, it was Romac through its supervisory 
personnel Licerio Araza which gave the employees their work schedule, 
monitored their attendance, determined the end result of their assigned 
tasks, as well as the methods and means by which the end result was to 
be accomplished.


The fact alone that Martinez, 
et. al
. were required by SMFI-MPPP 
to attend its company-sponsored seminars on Basic Poultry Operations, 
Good Manufacturing Practices, Sanitation, and HACCP Overview do not in 
any way equate to control. 
Non sequitur
. In any case, the Court 
finds the compelling reason behind this initiative: to minimize risks of
 exposure to possible violations of sanitation requirements in the food 
industry, for any deviation from the sanitation standards prescribed by 
law would open SMFI-MPPP to possible closure of business under the Meat 
Inspection Code of the Philippines.
[52]

 In the final analysis, this initiative is truly intended to ensure the 
safety and protection of the consuming public who buys the food products
 of SMFI-MPPP. Thus, instead of being criticized or suspected of 
circumventing the law, SMFI-MPPP should be commended for its corporate 
and social sense of responsibility in this regard. 
In the same vein, we do not find anything wrong or suspicious about the 
itemized billings sent by Romac to SMFI-MPPP, reflecting the employer's 
share of Romac to the employees' mandatory contributions to SSS, ECC, 
PhilHealth, and Pag-Ibig, and the amounts corresponding to agency fee, 
supplies and equipment allowance, and other labor standard benefits such
 as overtime pay, night shift differential, and holiday pay.


For one,
 the style or manner of billing by Romac as well as the 
style or manner of paying by SMFI-MPPP, be it itemized or lump-sum, is 
perfectly within their discretion. 
For another,
 Romac's itemized,
 billings and SMFI-MPPP's payments thereof readily reflect, on their 
face, whether Romac is indeed compliant with labor standard laws. This 
is a legitimate concern of SMFI-MPPP since under Section 19
[53]

 of DO 18-02 it can be held solidarily liable for the monetary claims of
 the contractual employees against the contractor arising from any 
violation of their rights. 

As for the fact that under the Contract for Sanitation, Maintenance, 
Janitorial, and Housekeeping Services and Contract for Substitute or 
Reliever Services, Martinez, 
et al
. performed their respective 
tasks in the premises of SMFI-MPPP, we curtly ask â where else should 
they perform these tasks? Precisely, Romac was engaged to keep the 
premises of SMFI-MPPP clean, safe, and sanitary at all times; hence, 
doing it elsewhere simply does not make sense.

In 
Manila Electric Co. v. Quisumbing
,
[54]
 the Court recognized that contracting out of services is an exercise of business judgment or management prerogative.


The management cannot be denied the faculty of promoting 
efficiency and attaining economy by a study of what units are essential 
for its operation. It has the ultimate determination of whether services
 should be performed by its personnel or contracted to outside agencies.
 While there should be mutual consultation, eventually deference is to 
be paid to what management decides. 
Contracting out of services is an exercise of business judgment or management prerogative.

 Absent proof that management acted in a malicious or arbitrary manner, 
the Court will not interfere with the exercise of judgment by an 
employer. x x x (Emphasis added)

x x x x


We further clarified in 
BPI Employees Union-Davao City-FUBU v. Bank of the Philippine Islands
[55]
 that it is within the prerogative of management to farm out any of its activities, 
regardless whether such activity is peripheral or core in nature.

 What is primordially important is that the service agreement does not 
violate the employee's right to security of tenure and payment of 
benefits to which he or she is entitled under the law.

So long as the outsourcing does not fall squarely as labor-only 
contracting, the arrangement does not ripen into an employer-employee 
relationship between the principal and the employees of the legitimate 
labor contractor. 

In closing, we refer back to the three (3) year old case of 
San Miguel Foods, Inc. v. Rivera,
[56]
 
viz
.:


In the case under consideration, it was sufficiently found 
by both the LA and the NLRC that the respondents applied with and were 
hired by ICSI, as evidenced by their individual Personal Information 
Sheets, employment contracts and Letters of Appointment. Concomitantly, 
ICSI issued them their individual identification cards asborne by the 
records. Even the payment of respondents' wages and other labor standard
 benefits were also made by ICSI, as shown by their payrolls and 
disbursement vouchers. More so, ICSI itself reported the respondents as 
its employees with the SSS, Philhealth, PAG-IBIG, and BIR. Also, ICSI 
was the one that made the necessary deductions on the respondents' 
salaries for their contributions (their premium share) thereto, which 
were all; properly remitted to the said agencies. As to the power of 
dismissal and to discipline, it was also ICSI that exercised the same. 
This is evident from the Notice to Explain and Memorandum it issued to 
its erring employees who violated its rules and regulations. Contrary to
 the claim of the respondents, which the CA affirmed, this Court holds 
that the controverted letter dated May 22, 2009 issued by the petitioner
 to ICSI contained no instruction from the former for the latter to 
transfer or even terminate the respondents. This Court finds 
satisfactory the petitioner's explanation that such letter merely 
informed ICSI of the changes in their agreement regarding the invoicing 
services that the invoicing operations at its head office would be 
discontinued and would be transferred to San Fernando, Pampanga. At the 
same time, the petitioner was just reminding ICSI to ensure that in the 
event there will be employees un willing to comply with the new ternis 
and conditions of their agreement, they should be properly dealt with in
 accordance with law. Stated differently, the petitioner only wanted to 
make sure that ICSI would not renege on its obligations to its 
employees. Lastly, the power of control similarly rests upon ICSI. As 
previously stated, it was ICSI's officers who have direct supervision 
over the respondents. ICSI's Base Controller and OIC were the ones who 
gave the respondents their work schedule and monitored their attendance,
 respectively.

It is worthy to note this Court's pronouncement in 
Royale Homes Marketing Corporation v. Alcantara,
 citing 
Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. National Labor Relations Commission, viz
.:


Not every form of control, is indicative of 
employer-employee relationship. A person wrho performs work for another 
and is subjected to its rules, regulations, and code of ethics does not 
necessarily become an employee. 
As long as the level of control does 
not interfere with the means and methods of accomplishing the assigned 
tasks, the rules imposed by the hiring party on the hired party do not 
amount to the labor law concept of control that is indicative of 
employer-employee relationship
. x x x


x x x x

With all the foregoing, this Court holds that no employer-employee 
relationship exists between the petitioner and the respondents. It is an
 error, therefore, on the part of the CA to order the petitioner to 
reinstate the respondents and to grant them all the benefits and 
privileges of regular employees. Not being petitioner's employees, thus,
 they cannot attain the regular status. Along side, the petitioner 
cannot be charged of constructive illegal dismissal for it is beyond its
 power to dismiss the respondents as they were never its employees.

x x x x


While 
Rivera
 involves a different contractor in the person
 of ICSI and a different kind of contracted service (invoicing), there 
appears to be a uniform corporate standard or set of rules followed by 
SMFI in contracting out the invoicing service in 
Rivera
 
and the janitorial services here, to wit: in both cases, the company 
chose only those legitimate contractors duly registered with SEC and 
DOLE, substantially capitalized, and servicing other A-list clients, as 
well; clothed with the power to hire and fire and discipline employees 
and most importantly, the power of control over the result of the tasks 
performed and the means and methods used to accomplish the same; and 
required the tasks to be performed in the company premises.


As it was, in 
Rivera,
 the Court found ICSI to be a 
legitimate labor contractor and the real employer of employees Rivera, 
et al. There is no rhyme or reason to rule otherwise in the present case
 considering that 
Rivera
 and this case are substantially analogous. 
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.


All told, the Court finds and holds that Romac is a legitimate labor contractor and truly the employer of Martinez, 
et al
. Romac could not be said to have dismissed Martinez, 
et al
.
 just because of its service contracts with SMFI-MPPP had expired. In 
fact, there is no question that Romac offered to reassign Martinez, 
et al
.
 to its other clients, but the latter declined because they erroneously 
believed that they had become the regular employees of SMFI-MPPP.


ACCORDINGLY,
 the petition of 
Martinez, 
et al
.
 in G.R. No. 231579 is 
DENIED
. On the other hand, the petition of 
San Miguel Foods, Inc., formerly Magnolia Poultry Processing Plant (SMFI-MPPP)
 in G.R. No. 231636 is 
GRANTED.
 

The Decision dated April 29, 2016 and Resolution dated May 9, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA â G.R. SP No. 129575 are 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE,
 and the Decision dated September 13, 2012 of the National Labor Relations Commission, 
REINSTATED.
 No costs.
