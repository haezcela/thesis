THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 206667, June 23, 2021 ]


GUILLERMA S. SILVA, PETITIONER, VS. CONCHITA S. LO, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




HERNANDO, J.:


Challenged in this petition for review
[1]
 on 
certiorari
 are the November 8, 2012 Decision
[2]
 and April 11, 2013 Resolution
[3]

 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 116979 which annulled 
and set aside the February 9, 2010 and August 27, 2010 Orders
[4]

 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 82, Quezon City in Civil Case
 No. Q-89-3137, an action for partition, accounting, delivery of shares 
and damages among the compulsory heirs of decedent Carlos Sandico, Jr. 
(Carlos Jr.).


The Facts:



On May 20, 1975, Carlos, Jr. died intestate leaving behind a sizeable 
estate to his compulsory heirs: the surviving spouse, Concepcion 
LimÂ­Sandico (Concepcion), and their children, Ma. Enrica Sandico-Pascual
 (Enrica), Carlos L. Sandico III (Carlos III), petitioner Guillerma 
SandicoÂ­Silva (Guillerma), Lily Sandico-Brown (Lily), Pamela S. Zapanta 
(Pamela), respondent Conchita S. Lo (Conchita) and Teodoro L. Sandico 
(Teodoro).



Sometime in 1976, the heirs of Carlos Jr. executed an Extrajudicial 
Settlement of Estate which provided that all properties of the decedent 
shall be owned in common, 
pro indiviso
, by his heirs.
[5]
 In September 1988, Carlos, Jr.'s heirs executed a Memorandum of Agreement for the physical division of the estate.
[6]
 However, both agreements were never implemented and the heirs remained 
pro indiviso
 co-owners of the estate's properties.



On August 3, 1989, Enrica, one of the heirs, filed Civil Case No. 
Q-89-3137 before the RTC impleading all the other heirs, her mother and 
siblings, as defendants. Eventually, Teodoro withdrew as defendant and 
joined suit as plaintiff-in-intervention.
[7]



Opposing the physical division of the properties, defendants therein 
primarily asserted Concepcion's usufructuary rights over the estate's 
real properties. They further alleged a diminished value and use of the 
properties should these be physically divided. Given the unanimity of 
their defense against the complaint, Conchita and two other heirs 
residing abroad, Lily and Pamela, executed a Special Power of Attorney 
(SPA) in favor of their mother Concepcion and their sister, Guillerma, 
respectively.
[8]



At the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following:


1. That this case is between members of the same family involving the mother and her children, all of whom are already of age;


2. That Carlos Sandico, Jr., husband of defendant [Concepcion] 
Lim-Sandico and father of the plaintiff [Enrica] and other defendants, 
died intestate on May 20, 1975, leaving as forced heirs the plaintiff 
and other defendants herein, that is, as legitimate spouse and seven (7)
 legitimate children;






 




3. That at the time of his death, the said deceased left the conjugal 
properties x x xx, one half (l/2) of which conjugal properties 
constituted his intestate estate;


4. That after the death of said Carlos Sandico, Jr., the parties herein 
executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate dated November 18, 1976 
distributing the intestate estate of the deceased, comprising of one 
half (1/2) of the aforesaid conjugal properties, pro indiviso among the 
parties herein in the proportions and manner stated in the said 
Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate;


5. That after the death of the deceased on May 20, 1975, the defendant 
Concepcion Sandico took over actual administration of the said intestate
 estate, jointly with defendant Carlos Sandico III as contended by the 
plaintiff but denied by the defendant; and


6. That the fruits or proceeds from the said intestate estate were not 
distributed by the [defendant Concepcion] among the [co-heirs, the 
decedent's legitimate children], from that time up to the present, in 
accordance with the proportionate distribution agreed upon in the 
Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate, because of an alleged grant of 
usufruct supposedly executed by the plaintiff [Enrica] and the other 
defendants in [their mother's] favor, the existence and validity of 
which the plaintiff [Enrica] questions or contests.
[9]



Thereafter, the RTC issued numerous orders reflecting the negotiations 
during court hearings for the distribution and partition of the estate 
among the heirs. The trial court encouraged the heirs to arrive at a 
mutually acceptable partition and distribution of the estate's 
properties. The contentious matters among the heirs were the inventory 
and classification of the estate's properties and their respective 
proposals for settlement and division thereof.



Significantly, on September 1, 1994, the Registry of Deeds of Pampanga issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 377745-R
[10]

 covering the subject property, a 103,024-square meter tract of 
agricultural land located at Talimundok, San Agustin, Magalang, 
Pampanga. The title was issued in the names of Concepcion and Carlos III
 subject to the encumbrances of the decedent's estate which listed the 
names of the other compulsory heirs, including herein petitioner and 
respondent, Guillerma and Conchita, respectively. The title's Memorandum
 of Encumbrances likewise noted Enrica's 
lis pendens
 in connection with Civil Case No. Q-89-3137.
[11]











 




In the course of the trial, the heirs agreed on the manner of division of each property-
via
 raffle conducted by the trial court. The heirs drew lots for an 
aliquot

 of each property of the estate, with Concepcion drawing first. For the 
heirs who failed to attend the hearing and the scheduled raffle, their 
respective counsels or their appointed attorney-in-fact, either 
Concepcion or Guillerma, in the case of Conchita, Lily and Pamela, drew 
the lot on their behalf.



For ease of reference, we reproduce some of the RTC's Orders:


On several dates, this Court issued the following Orders 
containing the stipulations agreed upon by the parties toward the 
settlement of this long delayed case:


(1) x x x As indicated in the previous Order of this Court, the only 
obstacle remaining in the way of the parties reaching a compromise 
agreement is the delivery of the Amorsolo paintings designated to the 
plaintiff [Enrica] and the plaintiff-in-intervention [Teodoro]. The 
defendants finally agreed to deliver the same; provided, this will be 
the last act that will be done to completely effectuate the compromise 
agreement. After discussion of the modes to be followed in connection 
with finalizing the compromise agreement and implementing the same, 
defendants' counsel agreed to prepare a final draft of a compromise 
agreement according to what have been agreed upon by the parties, 
without prejudice to the immediate physical division of the properties 
to be subdivided among the parties." (Court Order dated November 14, 
1996)




(2) x x x Pursuant to the Order of this Court dated December 12, 1996, 
the disposition of the lots referred to as Items No. 1 to 16 were taken 
up one after the other. The lot designated as Item 1 was accordingly 
first identified by clarifying its location, boundaries and character 
(conjugal). Counsel of record for all the parties agreed that defendant 
Concepcion Lim-Sandico draw ahead to determine which portion thereof 
(whether left or the right) should go to her as her conjugal share, as 
well as her share as one of the heirs together with her children. The 
Court accordingly conducted the drawing of lots. Defendant Concepcion 
Lim-Sandico drew the left portion or the lots designated as L-1 to 8 and
 R-8. The lots designated as R-1 to R-7 shall appertain to the seven 
children or heirs of the deceased. Under the personal supervision of the
 Presiding Judge, counsel for the plaintiff [Enrica] drew lot R-6; 
counsel for the plaintiff-inÂ­intervention drew lot R-7; defendant 
Guillerma Silva drew lot R-5 for herself and lot R-2 for defendant Lily 
S. Brown and Lot R-4 for defendant Pamela S. Zapanta; while Concepcion 
Lim-Sandico drew Lot R-1 for defendants Carlos Sandico III and Lot R-3 
for Conchita S. Lo.
[12]












 




For three years, under the supervision of the RTC, the heirs negotiated 
the terms of the estate's partition to be embodied in a compromise 
agreement. Not surprisingly, a flurry of drafts (of the compromise 
agreement) containing proposals for the distribution of the estate's 
properties were exchanged among the heirs.



After the plaintiffs, Enrica and Teodoro, signed the final draft of the 
compromise agreement, the defendants, Concepcion and the rest of her 
children, tarried signing thereof. Primarily, Concepcion continued to 
object to the division of the properties as it would purportedly reduce 
the value and utility thereof. This sparked another set of discussion 
among the opposing heirs culminating in the plaintiffs' (Enrica's and 
Teodoro's) motion for the RTC to "decide the case on the basis of the 
stipulations entered into by the parties embodied in the various orders 
of the Court."
[13]



On January 11, 2000, the RTC issued an Order of Partition:
[14]


After a careful and conscientious consideration of the 
foregoing submission of the plaintiffs and the defendants, this Court 
concluded that it is the better part of discretion to grant the former's
 Motion and decide the present case in accordance with their aforestated
 submissions and contentions.


x x x x


[T]his Court cannot set at naught what the parties and their lawyers 
have agreed upon by allowing them, or any of them, to repudiate, disown 
or disregard the Compromise Agreement that resulted from the 
negotiations they carried out and concluded under the aegis and 
supervision of this Court. In fact, the plaintiff and the 
plaintiff-in-intervention, with the assistance of their respective 
counsel, have already signed the final Compromise Agreement. Sad to say,
 the defendants balked at affixing their signatures when the plaintiff 
and the plaintiff-in-intervention refused to accede to the last minute 
change proposed by defendant Concepcion Lim-Sandico.


As a result, both plaintiff and plaintiff-in-intervention in effect 
moved and pray that this Court consider this case submitted for decision
 on the basis of the agreements reached by the parties during the 
arduous negotiations for the amicable settlement thereof, as embodied in
 the various relevant Orders of this Court aforequoted and on the basis 
of the terms and conditions of the Compromise Agreement already signed 
by them notwithstanding the refusal of the defendants to do the same.













While it is inclined to deem defendants' eleventh hour stand not to be without logical basis, 
this Court
 nonetheless is of the considered opinion, and it so 
holds
,
 that the defendants are legally bound by their previous acts and 
admissions and by the previous Orders of this Court as above-enumerated,
 and 
that the final Compromise Agreement
 already signed by the plaintiff and the plaintiff-in-intervention 
is
 sufficient evidence of the extent and composition of the estate of the 
late Carlos Sandico, Jr. and constitutes a valid and proper project for 
its partition
.


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring
 and ordering the partition of the intestate estate of the late Carlos 
Sandico, Jr. among his surviving spouse and children (parties herein) in
 accordance with and pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in 
the final Compromise Agreement already signed by the plaintiff and the 
plaintiff-in-intervention, dated September 17, 1998, which is hereby 
incorporated to and made part of this Order disposing of the present 
case by way of reference.
 All other reliefs prayed for by the parties in their respective relevant pleadings are hereby DENIED/DISMISSED.

On June 26, 2000, Conchita executed a Revocation of the SPA. Conchita 
filed a copy of the Revocation with the RTC but failed to furnish her 
agent, Concepcion, a copy thereof. The latest SPA dated June 8, 1999 
issued by Conchita in favor of Concepcion provided, thus:


That I have named, constituted and appointed, and by these 
presents do name, constitute and appoint my mother CONCEPCION 
LIM-SANDICO, x x x, to be my true and lawful attorney-in-fact, for me 
and in my name, place and stead, to do or perform any or all of the 
following acts and things, to wit:


1. To represent me in all the hearings of the above-mentioned case;


2. To enter into any compromise, settlement or any agreement with 
respect to the said case in any manner and under such terms and 
conditions as she may consider appropriate and acceptable;


3. To enter into any stipulation of facts and to make any admission in 
connection with the said case as she may consider acceptable and 
appropriate;


4. To enter into any partition agreement involving the properties 
subject of the said case of which I have an interest or participation;


5. To make, sign, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all documents
 or writing of whatever nature in connection with, or in relation to, 
the powers or authority herein given. x x x
[16]










Notably, Conchita continued to retain the same counsel, Atty. Danilo Tuason, as that of the other defendants in the case.



Despite the RTC's January 11, 2000 Order of Partition, various 
properties of the estate remained undivided and were not distributed 
among the heirs. Thus, on August 29, 2003, Enrica filed a Motion to 
Appoint Commissioners to Make Partition.
[17]



On September 10, 2003, Atty. Tuason, counsel for the defendants, filed a
 Manifestation opposing the appointment of commissioners on the ground 
that the agricultural land tenants have already agreed to the 
subdivision of the agricultural lands. Apparently, some of the estate's 
agricultural lands, including the herein subject property, were covered 
by Republic Act No. 6657, The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), 
for distribution to tenant-farmers. Thus, in compliance with the law, 
the heirs, represented by Concepcion, executed a 
Kasunduan
 dated May 19, 1999 (1999 
Kasunduan
)
[18]
 with the tenants. The 1999 
Kasunduan
, a voluntary land transfer arrangement allowed by the CARL, provided for a 50-50 sharing of the subject property, 
i.e.
, Carlos, Jr.'s heirs retained half thereof, and the other half will be distributed to the qualified beneficiaries, the tenants.



Thereafter, on October 17, 2003, the RTC granted the Motion to Appoint 
Commissioners. Yet again, the appointment of commissioners did not 
happen as plaintiffs appeared to have acquiesced to the defendants' 
proposed subdivision of the agricultural lands, including the herein 
subject property.



Sometime in 2006, Concepcion, representing herself and the other 
defendants-heirs, Carlos III, petitioner Guillerma, Lily, Pamela and 
respondent Conchita, executed a second agreement with the tenants of the
 subject property designated as "
Kasunduan sa Pagwawakas/Pagtatapos ng Relasyon bilang May-ari ng Lupa at mga Ortilano/Kasama ng Lupa
" (2006 
Kasunduan
).
[19]
 The 2006 
Kasunduan
, similar to the 1999 
Kasunduan
,
 likewise covered the partition of the subject property and the transfer
 of ownership of half thereof to the eight tenants while the other half 
remained with the heirs of Carlos, Jr.



Thereafter, the defendants filed a Motion for Approval of New Agreement 
and New Subdivision Plan of certain agricultural properties, including 
the subject property, which motion the plaintiffs no longer opposed. On 
March 2, 2007, the RTC issued an Order noting the agreement among the 
parties to undertake a raffle for the distribution of the subject 
property.
[20]
 Through their 
respective counsels, the parties filed a Minutes of the Raffle for the 
Distribution of the Property covered by TCT No. 377745-R.
[21]


Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:



On April 13, 2007, the trial court granted defendants' motions: it 
approved the New Agreement and Subdivision Plan and ordered the 
plaintiffs Enrica and Teodoro to sign the document. The 
fallo
 of the April 13, 2007 Order reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Approval of 
New Agreement and Subdivision Plan dated May 24, 2006 is hereby GRANTED.


Accordingly, said new agreement and subdivision plan are hereby approved
 subject to the distribution of the property as agreed upon in the 
raffle done by the parties on March 30, 2007. Plaintiffs Maria Enrica S.
 Pascual and Teodoro Sandico are therefore, hereby ordered to sign the 
same. x x x
[22]



Curiously, Conchita did not question the March 2 and April 13, 2007 Orders of the RTC.



On May 26, 2009, to execute the RTC's April 13, 2007 Order and 
facilitate the issuance of new titles over the subject property, 
Concepcion filed a Motion to Order Register of Deeds to Enter New 
Titles.



At this point, Conchita actively participated in the proceedings. On 
November 6, 2009, through a different counsel, Conchita opposed 
Concepcion's May 26, 2009 Motion on the ground that the 2006 
Kasunduan
 is void.
[23]
 As per Conchita, the 2006 
Kasunduan

 lacked her signature since she had already revoked the agency 
relationship with her mother, Concepcion. In addition, the signatories 
thereto, specifically the tenants, are not real parties in interest to 
the partition of the subject property forming part of the decedent's 
estate. In all, absent the signatures of all the heirs, the 2006 
Kasundaan
 cannot be the basis for the issuance of new titles covering the subject property.











 




On February 9, 2010, the RTC granted Concepcion's motion and ordered the
 Register of Deeds of Pampanga to enter new titles in the names of the 
tenants and the heirs of Carlos, Jr.
[24]
 It ruled that its April 13, 2007 Order approving the subdivision of the subject property and its distribution 
via

 raffle, had already become final and executory after the affected 
parties, including respondent Conchita, did not file the appropriate 
remedy therefrom.



The RTC affirmed its February 9, 2010 Order by denying Conchita's motion
 for reconsideration thereof. Thus, the twin Orders were assailed by 
Conchita before the appellate court in CA-G.R SP No. 116979.



Meanwhile, the Register of Deeds of Pampanga cancelled TCT No. 377745-R 
and issued TCT Nos. 1105, 1107, 1108, 1109, 1111 and 1112 in the names 
of the tenants.
[25]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:



In her petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of 
Court, Conchita alleged grave abuse of discretion in the RTC's February 
9, 2010 and August 27, 2010 Orders. In the main, Conchita contended 
that: (1) the RTC effectively partitioned and distributed the decedent's
 estate to parties who are neither heirs nor successors-in-interest of 
the decedent; and (2) the April 13, 2007 Order did not attain finality 
as it was a void judgment based, in turn, on a void agreement-the 2006 
Kasunduan
.



During the pendency of the petition for 
certiorari
, Concepcion and Carlos III died and were subsequently substituted by their heirs as respondents in the case.
[26]



As previously adverted to, the appellate court annulled and set aside 
the Orders of the RTC. In its November 8, 2012 Decision, the CA 
invalidated the 2006 
Kasunduan
 because it lacked the signature of
 all the heirs: Enrica's, Teodoro's and Conchita's who now repudiates 
her mother's, Concepcion's, signature on her behalf. The appellate court
 ruled that the 2006 
Kasunduan
 did not conform with the procedure
 laid down in Rule 69 of the Rules of Court on Partition. It concluded 
that a void agreement could not have validly partitioned the subject 
property nor could it have validly transferred subsequent title over 
half of the land to the tenants.





 




Only Guillerma filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the appellate court in its April 11, 2013 Resolution.



Hence, this appeal by 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court impugning grave error in the CA's ruling.


Issues


I. The Court of Appeals committed a reversible error when it
 ruled that the tenants, parties to the Kasunduan, are not indispensable
 parties to the Petition for 
Certiorari
.



II. The Court of Appeals seriously erred when it did not find the Petition for 
Certiorari
 to be an improper remedy.



III. The Court of Appeals committed a grave error when it held that the 
lower court committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction.
[27]


The threshold issue is procedural and lies in the propriety of a petition for 
certiorari
 to ultimately assail the issuance of new titles to the subject property.

 The assailed 2010 Orders of the RTC are traced to its April 13, 2007 
Order which approved the partition agreement for the subject property 
based on the 2006 Kasunduan. 
Thus, the main and substantive issues 
before us delve into: (1) the stage of the action for partition, Civil 
Case No. Q-89-3137, (2) the nature of the heirs' ownership over the 
estate's properties, and (3) the validity of the 2006 
Kasunduan
 to partition and divide the subject property.



To obviate confusion and considering the sparseness of the issues 
presented by the petitioner, we state the issues for adjudication of the
 Court:



I. Procedural



1. Whether the petition for 
certiorari
 filed by Conchita is the proper remedy to assail the February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders of the RTC;



2. Whether the tenants of the subject property should have been impleaded as indispensable parties to Conchita's petition for 
certiorari
; and



3. Whether the RTC's April 13, 2007 Order already attained finality.



 




II. Substantive



1. Whether the Orders of the RTC issued on April 13, 2007, February 9 
and August 27, 2010 are void, in violation of Rule 69 of the Rules of 
Court;



1.1 Corollary thereto, whether the RTC effectively distributed the 
estate to persons who are not heirs of the decedent by approving the 
transfer of, and title to, half of the subject property to the tenants;



2. Whether the 2006 Kasunduan partitioning the subject property is void 
because it was not signed by all the heirs of the decedent;



2.1 In the alternative, whether the 2006 Kasunduan is unenforceable as against Conchita.





At the outset, we note that the CA glossed over significant factual 
antecedents in the proceedings before the RTC. The matter on appeal, the
 questioned incident which reaches us, involves the partition of a 
specific property (the subject property) forming part of the decedent's 
estate-the main subject matter of the action for partition before the 
trial court. We emphasize that Civil Case No. Q-89-3137 is already at 
the second stageÂ­partition of the estate's properties by agreement of 
the parties.
[28]
 In fact, the RTC has long terminated the first stage in its January 11, 2000 Order for Partition.
[29]


Our Ruling


I. Procedural



In the main, petitioner asserts that the CA erred in annulling and 
setting aside the RTC's February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders as well as
 the April 13, 2007 Order approving the 2006 
Kasunduan
-the agreement of partition of the subject property. Petitioner posits that respondent ostensibly assailed, 
via
 a petition for 
certiorari

 before the appellate court, the February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders 
directing the Registry of Deeds of Pampanga to enter the new titles 
covering the subject property. According to petitioner, respondent was 
actually assailing the RTC's April 13, 2007 Order approving the 2006 
Kasunduan's

 partition of the subject property. Petitioner points out that 
respondent belatedly questioned the April 13, 2007 Order which had 
already attained finality, and thus resorted to the incorrect remedy of 
an extraordinary writ of 
certiorari
 before the CA. In addition, 
petitioner argues that respondent should have impleaded the tenants as 
indispensable parties to the petition for 
certiorari
.



The contentions of petitioner are correct: the CA erred in taking cognizance of the petition for 
certiorari

 which failed to implead indispensable parties and is an improper remedy
 to question the assailed orders of the RTC. The (1) April 13, 2007, (2)
 February 9, 2010, and (3) August 27, 2010 Orders of the RTC are final 
orders decreeing partition.



Section 2, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court on Partition provides:


Section 2.
 
Order for partition and partition by agreement thereunder
.
 - If after the trial the court finds that the plaintiff has the right 
thereto, it shall order the partition of the real estate among all the 
parties in interest. Thereupon the parties may, if they are able to 
agree, make the partition among themselves by proper instruments of 
conveyance, and the court shall confirm the partition so agreed upon by 
all the parties, and such partition, together with the order of the 
court confirming the same, shall be recorded in the registry of deeds of
 the place in which the property is situated.



A final order decreeing partition and accounting may be appealed by any party aggrieved thereby.



In connection thereto, Section 1, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court could not be any clearer on what may the subject of an appeal:


SECTION 1.
 
Subject of appeal
. - An appeal may 
be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the 
case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by these Rules to 
be appealable.


x x x x



In our jurisdiction, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court have laid down two phases of an action for partition: 
first
,
 the trial court, after determining that a co-ownership in fact exists 
and that partition is proper, issues an order for partition; and, 
second
,
 the trial court promulgates a decision confirming the sketch and 
subdivision of the properties submitted by the parties (if the parties 
reach an agreement) or by the appointed commissioners (if the parties 
fail to agree), as the case may be.
[30]





 




In this case, while the property to be partitioned is the entirety of 
Carlos, Jr.'s estate, only one of the properties thereof, the subject 
property, is the subject matter of the controversy before us.



The CA overlooked the fact that the first stage of the partition has 
long been terminated by the RTC. In fact, the status of the parties as 
the compulsory heirs of Carlos, Jr. was immediately stipulated among 
them.
[31]
 As early as January 
11, 2000, the trial court had already issued an Order of Partition of 
the Estate among the heirs pursuant to a compromise agreement. Notably, 
none of the parties appeared to have appealed this final order of 
partition.



We have had occasion to delineate the two phases of a judicial partition in several cases, to wit:


The first phase of a partition and/or accounting suit is 
taken up with the determination of whether or not a co-ownership in fact
 exists, (
i.e.
, not otherwise legally proscribed) and may be made
 by voluntary agreement of all the parties interested in the property. 
This phase may end with a declaration that plaintiff is not entitled to 
have a partition either because a co-ownership does not exist, or 
partition is legally prohibited. It may end, upon the other hand, with 
an adjudgment that a co-ownership does in truth exist, partition is 
proper in the premises and an accounting of rents and profits received 
by the defendant from the real estate in question is in order. In the 
latter case, the parties may, if they are able to agree, make partition 
among themselves by proper instruments of conveyance, and the court 
shall confirm the partition so agreed upon. 
In either case - 
i.e.
,
 either the action is dismissed or partition and/or accounting is 
decreed - the order is a final one, and may be appealed by any party 
aggrieved thereby.


The second phase commences when it appears that "the parties are unable 
to agree upon the partition" directed by the court. In that event, 
partition shall be done for the parties by the court with the assistance
 of not more than three (3) commissioners. This second stage may well 
also deal with the rendition of the accounting itself and its approval 
by the court after the parties have been accorded opportunity to be 
heard thereon, and an award for the recovery by the party or parties 
thereto entitled of their just share in the rents and profits of the 
real estate in question. Such an order is, to be sure, final and 
appealable.

Considering that the case is among family members, the RTC could not be 
faulted for giving the heirs a wide latitude to reach a compromise 
agreement for the partition of their patriarch's estate long after its 
January 11, 2000 Order for Partition. We note that in separate 
instances, the parties have agreed to settle the decedent's 
properties-the 1976 Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate and the 1988 MOA.
 As we have noted, none of these partition agreements materialized or 
were executed by the parties. Thus, the litigious action for partition 
and accounting filed by one of the heirs, plaintiff Enrica.



Since Carlos, Jr.'s estate is sizeable, consisting in numerous 
properties, each property may be the subject of separate agreements for 
its partition. The parties may also agree to a project of partition 
which covers the entire estate of the decedent. These various partition 
agreements must all be approved by court order which are considered 
final orders decreeing partition appealable by an aggrieved party under 
the second paragraph of Section 2, Rule 69.



In this case, the issue arose during the course of the second phase, 
i.e.
 during the individual partition of the estate's properties, specifically the subject property, contained in the 2006 
Kasunduan

 which was approved by the RTC in its April 13, 2007 Order. The RTC's 
April 13, 2007 Order is a final order which respondent failed to appeal 
before the CA following Section 2, Rule 69 in relation to Section 1, 
Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. Ineluctably, the April 13, 2007 Order had
 attained finality prompting the RTC's subsequent orders granting the 
entry of new titles to "the resulting subdivision of [the subject 
property] x x x embraced under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 377745 x
 x x in the names of the tenants and parties to whom they are allocated 
as indicated in the Kasunduan approved by this Court in its Order dated 
April 13, 2007."



We find that the RTC's February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders pertain to 
the requirement in Section 2, Rule 69 for the recording of the partition
 agreed upon by all the parties and the order of the court confirming 
the deed of partition in the registry of deeds of the place where the 
property is situated.
[33]



It is therefore plainly apparent that respondent sought to obliquely 
assail a final order of partition of the trial court when she questioned
 the RTC's subsequent final orders of partition, i.e. the February 9 and
 August 27, 2010 Orders, in a petition for 
certiorari
 before the 
CA. Contrary to the rule laid down in Section 2 of Rule 69, respondent 
circumvented the procedure to question the partition of the subject 
property 
via
 a record on appeal
[34]
 by treating the February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders as interlocutory orders which could not be the subject of an appeal.



We have defined an interlocutory order as referring to something between
 the commencement and end of the suit which decides some point or matter
 but it is not the final decision on the whole controversy.
[35]

 It does not terminate or finally dismiss or finally dispose of the 
case, but leaves something to be done by the court before the case is 
finally decided on the merits.
[36]
 On the other hand, a final order is one which leaves to the court nothing more to do to resolve the case.
[37]



On more than one occasion, we laid down the test to ascertain whether an order is interlocutory or final 
i.e.
,
 "Does it leave something to be done in the trial court with respect to 
the merits of the case? If it does, it is interlocutory; if it does not,
 it is final. The key test to what is interlocutory is when there is 
something more to be done on the merits of the case.
[38]



The February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders are not interlocutory as there
 is nothing more to be done as regards the partition of the subject 
property. What remains to be done is the partition of the rest of the 
estate's properties and the accounting for the fruits, profits and 
rentals thereof. Clearly, respondent filed an incorrect remedy to assail
 several final orders of the RTC.



Since ownership of half of the subject property was already transferred 
and registered to new owners, respondent should have filed a separate 
action and directly annul the new titles of the tenants alleging the 
purported void partition, the 2006 
Kasunduan
. But she did not.


Next
. Corollary to the foregoing, respondent should have 
impleaded the new title holders, the tenants, as indispensable or 
necessary parties to the petition for 
certiorari
 before the CA.



The tenants are not strangers or third parties to the subject property. 
Prior to being transferees of half of the subject property, they were 
the agricultural tenants thereof. We note, however, that the subject 
property is private agricultural compulsorily covered for distribution 
to qualified beneficiaries such as the tenants under the CARL. Hence, 
the heirs entered a voluntary transfer arrangement, offering to sell 
half of the subject property pursuant to the CARL. Notably, the parties 
have known, consented and acquiesced to the voluntary sale of the 
subject property as contained in the 1999 
Kasunduan
 executed prior to the 2006 
Kasunduan
 and the respondent's revocation of the agency relationship with her mother, Concepcion, in 2000.



Concededly, the tenants are not heirs and are thus strangers to the 
estate of the decedent, the subject matter of the action for partition. 
However, in relation to the subject property, as tenants who are 
qualified beneficiaries thereof under the CARL and to whom new titles 
had been issued, they are palpably real parties-in-interest.
[39]

 While the validity of the partition of the subject property and 
consequent distribution thereof can still be finally determined in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 116979, a complete relief for those already parties or 
the complete determination of the claim could not be had since the 
tenants were not impleaded. In short, the tenants are not indispensable 
parties
[40]
 but, at the least, are necessary parties
[41]
 in the determination of the partition of the subject property.



In 
Reyes v. Mauricio
[42]

 we ruled that a tenancy relationship carmot be extinguished by the 
sale, alienation or the transfer of legal possession of the landholding.
 Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199 or the Agricultural Tenancy Act 
provides:


SECTION 9. 
Severance of Relationship
. - The tenancy 
relationship is extinguished by the voluntary surrender of the land by, 
or the death or incapacity of, the tenant, but his heirs or the members 
of his immediate farm household may continue to work the land until the 
close of the agricultural year. 
The expiration of the period of the 
contract as fixed by the parties, and the sale or alienation of the land
 does not of themselves extinguish the relationship. In the latter case,
 the purchaser or transferee shall assume the rights and obligations of 
the former landholder in relation to the tenant. In case of death of the
 landholder, his heir or heirs shall likewise assume his rights and 
obligations.
 (Emphasis supplied)



In addition, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 3844 (Code of Agrarian Reforms of the Philippines) likewise provides:


SEC. 10. 
Agricultural Leasehold Relation Not Extinguished by Expiration of Period, etc
.
 - The agricultural leasehold relation under this Code shall not be 
extinguished by mere expiration of the term or period in a leasehold 
contract nor by the sale, alienation or transfer of the legal possession
 of the landholding. 
In case the agricultural lessor
 sells, alienates or 
transfers
 the legal possession of the landholding, the purchaser or transferee 
thereof shall be subrogated to the rights and substituted to the 
obligations of the agricultural lessor
. (Emphasis supplied)



By operation of law, the tenancy relationship between the tenants on one
 hand, and the co-owners of the subject property, the heirs of the 
decedent, on the other hand, subsisted even after the death of one of 
the landholders. Under the CARL, the tenants are deemed qualified 
beneficiaries to ownership of a portion of their tilled land. 
Ultimately, the tenants cannot be cursorily excluded from a court 
determination of the validity of the partition, and consequent change in
 ownership, of the subject property.


II. Substantive



In annulling the RTC's February 9 and August 27, 2010 Orders, the CA 
ruled that these emanated from the trial court's April 13, 2007 Order 
which, in tum, was based on a void partition agreement-the 2006 
Kasunduan
. The CA makes much of the fact that not all the heirs signed the 2006 
Kasunduan
 in violation of Rule 69 of the Rules of Court, buttressed by our holding in 
Dadizon v. Bernadas
[43]

 that the partition of property should be agreed upon by all parties who
 signified their assent by signing the partition agreement.





We do not agree. Despite the lack of signatures of specifically three 
(3) heirs of the decedent, Enrica, Teodoro and respondent Conchita, the 
2006 
Kasunduan
 is a valid partition of the subject property which
 was correctly confirmed by the RTC in its April 13, 2007 Order. Even 
without going into the finality of the April 13, 2007 Order, the 
antecedents herein which we have painstakingly outlined will bear out 
that all the heirs have assented to the partition of the subject 
property.



Before we proceed further, we find it imperative to lay down the Civil Code framework of our discussion.



1. The subject property was conjugal partnership property of the Spouses Carlos, Jr. and Concepcion Sandico.
[44]

 Thus, half thereof is part of Carlos, Jr.'s estate while the other half
 pertained to that of Concepcion's, who could validly alienate her 
share.



2. From the moment of death of the decedent, the heirs' rights to the succession all vested
[45]
 and resulted in their co-ownership of the decedent's estate.
[46]



3. The parties in this case are all compulsory heirs, with the surviving
 spouse, Concepcion, inheriting equivalent to the share of a legitimate 
child, all her children.
[47]
 For the subject property, Concepcion owned 9/16
th
 thereof, as conjugal owner of half plus 1/8
th
 portion as her inheritance from the decedent.



4. Each co-owner has full ownership of his part of the property, even if held 
pro indiviso
, which he can alienate, assign or mortgage.
[48]
 Corollary thereto, a co-owner may demand at any time the partition of the thing owned in common;
[49]
 no co-owner shall be obliged to remain in one.
[50]



5. The binding force of a contract must be recognized as far as it is legally possible to do so.
[51]
 (mutuality of contracts)



6. Unenforceable contracts which are ratified by the person in whose name it was entered into are effective.
[52]


First
. We sustain the RTC's confirmation of the 2006 Kasunduan. 
As correctly ruled by the trial court, albeit plaintiffs Enrica and 
Teodoro did not sign the 
Kasunduan
, they acquiesced to the 
partition and distribution of the subject property, the qualified 
tenants receiving half thereof. In fact, Enrica filed a Manifestation 
dated December 18, 2006 that she and Teodoro will not object to the 2006
 
Kasunduan
 as long as they will be given their preferred portion 
of the subject property. Truly indicative of Enrica's and Teodoro's 
acquiescence to the 2006 
Kasunduan
 is the fact that neither of them have questioned it nor have they intervened in CA-G.R. SP No. 116979 and in this appeal.








 




As regards the absence of Conchita's signature to the 2006 
Kasunduan
 after she has purportedly repudiated the agency relationship with her mother in 2000, we rule that the 2006 
Kasunduan
 is effective as against Conchita.



Even without going into the validity of Concepcion signing the 2006 
Kasunduan

 on Conchita's behalf, the appellate court could not void the sale and 
transfer of half of the subject property to its qualified beneficiaries 
under a voluntary transfer arrangement provided in the CARL. We 
reproduce herein the pertinent provisions of the law:


CHAPTER II

Coverage


Section 4. 
Scope
. - The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 
1989 shall cover, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity 
produced, all public and private agricultural lands, as provided in 
Proclamation No. 131 and Executive Order No. 229, including other lands 
of the public domain suitable for agriculture.


More specifically the following lands are covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:






(a) 


All alienable and disposable lands
 of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture. No 
reclassification of forest or mineral lands to agricultural lands shall 
be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking into
 account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have
 determined by law, the specific limits of the public domain.














(b) 


All lands of the public domain in excess of the specific limits as determined by Congress in the preceding paragraph;














(c)


 All other lands owned by the Government devoted to or suitable for agriculture; and














(d)


 All private lands devoted to or 
suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised 
or that can be raised thereon.






CHAPTER V

Land Acquisition


Section 16. 
Procedure for Acquisition of Private Lands
.
 - For purposes of acquisition of private lands, the following procedures shall be followed:






(a)


After having identified 
the land, the landowners and the beneficiaries, the DAR shall send its 
notice to acquire the land to the owners thereof, by personal delivery 
or registered mail, and post the same in a conspicuous place in the 
municipal building and barangay hall of the place where the property is 
located. Said notice shall contain the offer of the DAR to pay a 
corresponding value in accordance with the valuation set forth in 
Sections 17, 18, and other pertinent provisions hereof.














(b) 


Within thirty (30) days from the date of 
receipt of written notice by personal delivery or registered mail, the 
landowner, his administrator or representative shall inform the DAR of 
his acceptance or rejection of the offer.














(c)


 
If the landowner accepts the offer of the 
DAR, the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) shall pay the landowner the 
purchase price of the land within thirty (30) days after he executes and
 delivers a deed of transfer in favor of the government and surrenders 
the Certificate of Title and other muniments of title.














(d) 


In case of rejection or failure to reply, the 
DAR shall conduct summary administrative proceedings to determine the 
compensation for the land requiring the landowner, the LBP and other 
interested parties to submit evidence as to the just compensation for 
the land, within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the notice. After
 the expiration of the above period, the matter is deemed submitted for 
decision. The DAR shall decide the case within thirty (30) days after it
 is submitted for decision.














(e)


 
Upon receipt by the landowner of the 
corresponding payment or, in case of rejection or no response from the 
landowner, upon the deposit with an accessible bank designated by the 
DAR of the compensation in cash or in LBP bonds in accordance with this 
Act, the DAR shall take immediate possession of the land and shall 
request the proper Register of Deeds to issue a Transfer Certificate of 
Title (TCT) in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. The DAR 
shall thereafter proceed with the redistribution of the land to the 
qualified beneficiaries.














(f) 


Any party who disagrees with the decision may 
bring the matter to the court of proper jurisdiction for final 
determination of just compensation.








CHAPTER VI

Compensation






Section 20. 
Voluntary Land Transfer
. - Landowners of 
agricultural lands subject to acquisition under this Act may enter into a
 voluntary arrangement for direct transfer of their lands to qualified 
beneficiaries subject to the following guidelines:






(a)


All notices for voluntary 
land transfer must be submitted to the DAR within the first year of the 
implementation of the CARP. Negotiations between the landowners and 
qualified beneficiaries covering any voluntary land transfer which 
remain unresolved after one (1) year shall not be recognized and such 
land shall instead be acquired by the government and transferred 
pursuant to this Act.














(b) 


The terms and conditions of such transfer 
shall not be less favorable to the transferee than those of the 
government's standing offer to purchase from the landowner and to resell
 to the beneficiaries, if such offers have been made and are fully known
 to both parties.














(c) 


The voluntary agreement shall include 
sanctions for non-compliance by either party and shall be duly recorded 
and its implementation monitored by the DAR.
 (Emphasis supplied).







We find no equivocation in the requirements listed above. The transfer of half of the subject property was under the 
aegis

 of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) pursuant to the law which 
the heirs cannot ignore or circumvent by their claim that the 2006 
Kasunduan was not validly executed. Given the compulsory requirement of 
the law, there is no validity to respondent's assertion which was 
sustained by the CA, that property of the decedent was distributed to 
non-heirs. Plainly, the partition of the subject property, and the 
consequent transfer and titling of half thereof to qualified 
beneficiaries, is valid, just and binding on all the heirs of the 
decedent, including Conchita.


Second
. The transfer and distribution of half of the subject 
property can be considered as the share of Concepcion in the conjugal 
partnership property regime during her marriage to the decedent. The 
legitimate children's share in the subject property pertains to only 7/8
th
 of 1/2 thereof, the half covering Carlos, Jr.'s share in the property regime. From that, Conchita's share is 1/8
th
 of 1/2, amounting to 1/16
th
 of the entire property as opposed to her mother whose total share is 9/16
th
.
 Conchita's right to the subject property is by virtue of succession, 
but even that pertains to only to a portion of one half thereof. 
Conchita's full rights as co-owner does not pertain to Concepcion's half
 of the subject property.


Third
. The CA mistakenly annulled the entire partition, and sale 
of half, of the subject property to the tenants contrary to Articles 
493-495 and 498 of the Civil Code which, in sum, allow for alienation by
 a co-owner of his or her share in the co-owned property, termination of
 the co-ownership, and partition of the property. The provisions read:


Article 493.
 Each co-owner shall have the full 
ownership of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto,
 and he may therefore alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even 
substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights 
are involved. But the effect of the alienation or the mortgage, with 
respect to the co-owners, shall be limited to the portion which may be 
allotted to him in the division upon the termination of the 
co-ownership.


Article 494.
 No co-owner shall be obliged to remain in the 
coÂ­ownership. Each co-owner may demand at any time the partition of the 
thing owned in common, insofar as his share is concerned.


x x xx


Article 495.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding 
article, the co-owners cannot demand a physical division of the thing 
owned in common, when to do so would render it unserviceable for the use
 for which it is intended. But the co-ownership may be terminated in 
accordance with article 498.


Article 498.
 Whenever the thing is essentially indivisible and 
the coÂ­owners cannot agree that it be allotted to one of them who shall 
indemnify the others, it shall be sold and its proceeds distributed.



We are not unaware of the basic principle in the law of co-ownership, 
both under the present Civil Code as in the Code of 1889, that no 
individual co-owner can claim title to any definite portion of the land 
or thing owned in common until the partition thereof. Prior to that 
time, all that the co-owner has is an ideal, or abstract, quota or 
proportionate share in the entire thing owned in common by all the 
co-owners.



As a co-owner 
pro indiviso
, Conchita exercises her right to the entire coÂ­owned property. In 
Quijano v. Amante
,
[53]
 we ruled that each of the co-owners holds the property 
pro indiviso

 and exercises his or her rights with the entire property; thus, each 
co-owner may use and enjoy the property with no other limitation than 
that he shall not injure the interests of his co-owners. Until a 
division is actually made, the respective share of each cannot be 
determined, and every co-owner exercises, together with his 
co-participants, joint ownership of the pro indiviso property, in 
addition to his use and enjoyment of it. However, as we have previously 
discussed, Conchita's share pertains to only 1/8
th
 of 1/2 of the subject property which belongs to the estate of the decedent, Carlos, Jr.



In 
Tabasondra v. Spouses Constantino
,
[54]

 we upheld the right of coÂ­owners (Valentina and Valeriana) to alienate 
their pro indiviso shares to (Sebastian and Tarcila) even without the 
knowledge or consent of their coÂ­owner (Cornelio) because the alienation
 covered the disposition of only their respective interests in the 
common property. We ruled pursuant to Article 493 of the Civil Code that
 each co-owner "shall have the full ownership of his part and of the 
fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may therefore alienate, 
assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its 
enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved," but "the effect of
 the alienation or the mortgage, with respect to the co-owners, shall be
 limited to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division 
upon the termination of the co-ownership." Hence, the petitioners 
therein, as the successors-inÂ­interest of Cornelio, could not validly 
assail the alienation by Valentina and Valeriana of their shares in 
favor of the respondents.



Hewing closely to the foregoing is our ruling in the case of 
Heirs of the Late Gerry Ecarma v. Court of Appeals
[55]
 where we sustained the right of an heir to ask for a partition of co-owned properties inherited from the decedent therein:


Their objection to the actual partition notwithstanding, 
herein petitioners and even Rodolfo Ecarma cannot compel the other 
co-heirs to remain in perpetual co-ownership over the subject 
properties. Article 494, in relation to Article 1083, of the Civil Code 
provides:


Art. 494. No co-owner shall be obliged to remain in the co-ownership. 
Each co-owner may demand at any time the partition of the thing owned in
 common, insofar as his share is concerned.


Nevertheless, an agreement to keep the thing undivided for a certain 
period of time, not exceeding ten years, shall be valid. This term may 
be extended by a new agreement.


A donor or testator may prohibit partition for a period which shall not exceed twenty years.


Neither shall there be any partition when it is prohibited by law.



No prescription shall run in favor of a co-owner or co-heir against his 
coÂ­owners or co-heirs so long as he expressly or impliedly recognizes 
the coÂ­ownership.


Art. 1083. Every co-heir has a right to demand the division of the 
estate unless the testator should have expressly forbidden its 
partition, in which case the period of indivision shall not exceed 
twenty years as provided in Article 494. This power of the testator to 
prohibit division applies to the legitime.



Even though forbidden by the testator, the co-ownership terminates when 
any of the causes for which partnership is dissolved takes place, or 
when the court finds for compelling reasons that division should be 
ordered, upon petition of one of the co-heirs.


The impasse between the parties is due to herein petitioners' persistent
 objection to proposals for the partition of the subject properties. The
 deceased Gerry Ecarma, Rodolfo Ecarma and herein petitioners 
consistently opposed the proposed partition of the administrator, 
respondent Renato, since such is ostensibly "not feasible, impractical 
and renders detrimental use of the Kitanlad property." However, it is 
apparent that Gerry Ecarma and his heirs (herein petitioners) completely
 object to any kind of partition of the subject properties, contravening
 even the proposed sale thereof.


We note that petitioners have been careful not to proffer that the 
subject properties are indivisible or that physical division of thereof 
would render such unserviceable since Article 495 of the Civil Code 
provides the remedy of termination of co-ownership in accordance with 
Article 498 of the same Code, i.e., sale of the property and 
distribution of the proceeds. Ineluctably, therefore, herein 
petitioners' absolute opposition to the partition of the subject 
properties which are co-owned has no basis in law. As mere co-owners, 
herein petitioners, representing the share of the deceased Gerry Ecarma,
 cannot preclude the other owners likewise compulsory heirs of the 
deceased spouses Natalio and Arrninda, from exercising all incidences of
 their full ownership.



Clearly in this case, the partition and alienation of half of the subject property, through the 2006 
Kasunduan
, is not completely void and cannot be annulled as to the share of Concepcion and the other heirs, including Enrica and Teodoro.


Fourth
. The CA makes much of the fact that Conchita revoked the 
SPA she had given to her mother, Concepcion, who therefore no longer had
 authority to represent her and sign the 2006 
Kasunduan
 on her behalf.



To begin with, Conchita failed to inform her agent, Concepcion, of the 
fact of revocation. She continued to clothe her mother, Concepcion, with
 apparent authority to act on her behalf in Civil Case No. Q-893137. 
Moreover, Conchita's counsel, Atty. Tuason, who was likewise the counsel
 of the other defendants in the case, validly represented her in the 
proceedings before the RTC until his withdrawal as counsel for Conchita 
in 2009.



Law and jurisprudence recognize actual authority and apparent authority.
[56]
 Apparent authority is based on the principle of estoppel. The Civil Code provides:


Article 1431. Through estoppel an admission or 
representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and 
cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon.


x x x x








 




Article 1869. Agency may be express, or implied from the acts of the 
principal, from his silence or lack of action, or his failure to 
repudiate the agency, knowing that another person is acting on his 
behalf without authority.


Agency may be oral, unless the law requires a specific form.



Conchita failed to give her mother notice of the revocation and belatedly repudiated her assent to the 2006 
Kasunduan

 which was signed by her mother on her behalf despite her full and 
complete knowledge that Civil Case No. Q-89-3137 was ongoing and that 
the partition of her father's estate's properties was underway. Conchita
 could not feign ignorance of the action for partition and what it 
sought, and the consequence of failing to inform her mother that she had
 revoked the SPA which she had previously given her.



The various Orders of the RTC partitioning different properties of the 
estate clearly show that Concepcion or Atty. Tuason repeatedly and 
consistently drew the lot on Conchita's behalf in the numerous raffles 
conducted by the trial court to determine which portion of the property 
to be divided will go to which heir.



The second paragraph of Article 1317 of the Civil Code provides that "a 
contract entered into in the name of another by one who has no authority
 x x x shall be unenforceable, unless it is ratified, expressly or 
impliedly, by the person on whose behalf it has been executed x x x."



In this case, Conchita has impliedly ratified her mother's assent to the
 partition on her behalf by failing to assail the RTC's April 13, 2007 
Order and the conduct of the raffle for distribution of the property 
even after she had obtained a copy of the Order and the Minutes of 
Raffle.
[57]



We thus sustain petitioner's assertion that:


31. The new TCTs in favor of the tenants were issued in 
2009. Therefore, respondent Conchita could have prevented the 
cancellation of TCT No. 377745 and the actual distribution of the land 
had she taken action as early as 2008, when she obtained a copy of the 
Minutes of the Raffle.
[58]



On the whole, we abide by the principle that the binding force of a 
contract must be recognized as far as it is legally possible to do so. 
Quando res not valet ut ago, valeat quantum valere patest.


Last
. The Rules of Court was designed to aid in the proper and 
efficient dispensation of justice. Technical rules of procedure are not 
ends in themselves but are primarily devised for a just and speedy 
disposition of every action and proceedings.
[59]



As previously noted, throughout the proceedings, the RTC extended a wide
 latitude to enable the parties to reach a partition agreement 
acceptable to all parties. However, for one reason or another, the 
physical division of the estate's properties has not progressed.



At the point when Enrica already moved for the appointment of 
commissioners, defendants therein suddenly manifested that there was no 
need therefor since they had a proposal for the partition of the 
agricultural lands of the estate. Yet again, the actual partition was 
stalled.



When the herein subject property was eventually partitioned in the 2006 
Kasunduan and confirmed by the RTC in its April 13, 2007 Order, 
respondent Conchita sought to annul the partition which had already 
resulted in the cancellation of TCT No. 37745 and the issuance of new 
titles.



Quite apparent from all the foregoing is that a partition of the estate 
by agreement of the parties will never happen. Other heirs of the 
decedent have already died and are represented in the partition of the 
estate by their own heirs. Thus, we direct the RTC, Branch 82, Quezon 
City in Civil Case No. Q-89-3137 to appoint commissioners to make the 
partition pursuant to Section 3, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court.
