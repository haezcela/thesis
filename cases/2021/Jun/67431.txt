LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case



This petition
[1]
 seeks to reverse the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109103, entitled 
In
 Re: Application for Registration of Original Title; Science Park of the
 Philippines, Inc., herein represented by its Executive Vice President 
and General Manager, Mr. Richard Albert I. Osmond v. Republic of the 
Philippines
:


Decision
[2]
 dated 
March 28, 2019 affirming the Decision dated April 12, 2017 of the 
Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Malvar-Balete, Batangas in Land 
Registration Case No. N-138 which granted respondent's application for 
original registration of title; and




Resolution
[3]
 dated July 9, 2019, denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.



Antecedents



On September 3, 2015, respondent Science Park of the Philippines, Inc. 
filed an application for original registration of title with the 
Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tanauan City, Batangas under Section 14(1)
 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (PD 1529).
[4]

 In its Order dated September 10, 2015, the RTC delegated the hearing 
and disposition of the application to the MCTC, Malvar-Balete.
[5]





Respondent essentially alleged that it is the owner in fee simple of a 
5,255-square meter parcel of land designated as Lot No. 3394, Psc-47, 
Malvar Cadastre,
[6]
 situated in Brgy. Luta Sur, Malvar, Batangas.
[7]

 It acquired the property from one Antonio Aranda through a Deed of 
Absolute Sale dated January 6, 2014. It has been, by itself or through 
its predecessors-in-interest, in open, continuous, exclusive, and 
notorious possession of the property since June 12, 1945 or earlier. 
Finally, the property is within the alienable and disposable portion of 
the public domain.





On the other hand, petitioner Republic of the Philippines entered its 
appearance through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). The MCTC, 
however, issued an Order of general default dated April 26, 2016 as no 
oppositor allegedly objected to respondent's application.
[8]



During the trial, respondent sought to establish the history of the ownership of the land, 
viz
:








January 29, 1944:


 


Segunda Kalaw sold the land to her sister Micaela Kalaw


 






 


 




 






November 5, 1953: 


 


After Micaela passed, her heirs sold the land to Crisanto Laydia and his wife Agrifina Arcillas through a 
Kasulatan ng Bilihang Patuluyan ng Lupa


 








 




 






June 26, 1996: 


 


Antonio A. Aranda bought the land from Crisanto through a deed of absolute sale.


 








 




 






January 6, 2014: 


 


Respondent bought the land form Antonio A. Aranda
[9]


 








A 
representative of the Office of Municipal Assessor
 of Malvar 
confirmed this sequence based on the tax declarations issued in relation
 to the property. The oldest tax declaration on file was dated 1955 in 
the name of Segunda Kalaw.



Meanwhile, witnesses from the 
Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR), DENR-City Environment and Natural Resources 
(DENR-CENRO), Batangas City and the National Mapping and Resource 
Information Authority (NAMRIA)
 all testified that the property was 
within the alienable and disposable portion of the public domain based 
on Land Classification Map No. 3601 and DENR Administrative Order No. 
97-37 issued by then Secretary Victor O. Ramos on December 22, 1997.
[10]





Finally, respondent's immediate predecessor-in-interest 
Antonio Aranda
 and one 
Eliseo Garcia
 (born on June 4, 1933), both residents of Malvar, Batangas, gave their personal accounts relating to the property.
[11]


Eliseo Garcia
 testified that as a resident of Brgy. Luta Sur since birth, he had sufficient knowledge of the property.
[12]

 In fact, he lived just one (1) kilometer away from Lot No. 3394 and 
three (3) houses from the house of Segunda's sister Micaela.
[13]

 When he was about seven (7) years old, he and his friends used to play 
and gather fruits from the property and its surroundings as children of 
his age casually did at that time. It was of public knowledge that the 
Kalaws owned several parcels of land adjoining each other, including Lot
 No. 3394. Segunda, in particular, was the owner of Lot No. 3394 until 
she sold it to her sister Micaela before the Second World War erupted.
[14]

 Not long after, Micaela sold the subject property in favor of Agrifina 
Arcillas and Crisanto Laydia who occupied and exercised all acts of 
possession and ownership thereon. Subsequently, the property got sold to
 Antonio Aranda who also cultivated the same. No on e made an adverse 
claim of ownership over the property.
[15]




Antonio Aranda
 admitted that he bought Lot No. 3394 from Crisanto Laydia and later sold it to respondent via Deed of Absolute Sale,
[16]

 dated January 6, 2014.While he was still owner of the property, he 
cultivated it with agricultural plants, harvested its fruits, and also 
paid realty taxes thereon.



Respondent offered the following documentary evidence: Technical Description for Lot 3394;
[17]
 Sepia copy of Plan, Lot No. 3394, Psc-47, Malvar Cadastre;
[18]
 Land Classification Map No. 3601,
[19]
 and tax declarations, among others. The Sepia copy of Plan of Lot No. 3394
[20]
 bears the technical description and sketch of the boundaries of Lot No. 3394 and an annotation indicating, thus:


x x x x


Lot 3394, Psc-47, Malvar Cadastre 
is inside alienable and disposable zone

 as per Project No. 39, L.C. Map No. 3601 certified on December 22, 1007
 as per CERTIFICATION approved by Laudemir S. Salac, OIC, CENR Officer 
of Batangas City on Jul 21, 2014.

The Ruling of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court



By Decision
[21]
 dated April 12, 2017, the MCTC granted respondent's application, 
viz
.:
[22]


WHEREFORE, the foregoing discussion considered, upon 
confirmation of the Order of General Default, this Court resolves to 
adjudicate and decree Lot No. 3394, Psc-47, Malvar Cadastre, 
Ap-04-016437 with an area of FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE 
(5,255) SQUARE METERS in favor of and in the name of SCIENCE PARK OF THE
 PHILIPPINES, INC, with office address at 17th Floor, Robinsons Summit 
Center, 6783 Ayala Avenue, Makati, Metro Manila, in accordance with 
Presidential Decree No. 1529 otherwise known as the Property 
Registration Decree.


SO ORDERED.



It found respondent's evidence to have sufficiently proved that it has 
been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and 
occupation of a parcel of land classified to be within the alienable and
 disposable zone of the public domain since June 12, 1945 or earlier.
[23]




Proceedings before the Court of Appeals



On appeal
[24]
 the OSG faulted 
the MCTC for granting the application despite respondent's alleged 
failure to prove a registrable title under Section 14, PD 1529.
[25]


For one
, respondent did not adduce evidence that it has been in 
open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the property 
since June 12, 1945 or earlier.
[26]
 Although respondent 's claim of ownership dates back to the 1940s, the earliest tax declaration presented was dated 1955.
[27]


For another
, respondent could not have acquired the property through prescription.
[28]

 For there had been no manifestation from the government that the 
property was already declared patrimonial or no longer retained for 
public service or for the development of national wealth pursuant to 
Article 422 of the New Civil Code.
[29]



Respondent riposted
[30]
 that 
it had successfully proven its registrable title over the property. 
Curiously, the OSG anchored its opposition on its purported failure to 
comply with Section 14(2), PD 1529. As it was, however, its application 
was based on Section 14(1), PD 1529. The two provisions have two 
different sets of requirements.
[31]





At any rate, it complied with Section 1 4(1), thus: 
first
,
 Land Classification Map No. 3601 and DENR Administrative Order No. 
97-37 proved the alienable and disposable character of Lot No. 3394; 
second
,
 Eliseo Garcia, an octogenarian resident of Malvar, Batangas, testified 
on how respondent's predecessors-in-interest enjoyed open, exclusive, 
adverse, continuous and notorious possession of the property; 
finally
,
 the transfer of ownership of the property from Segunda Kalaw in 1944 to
 the present was traced through documents kept intact at the Assessor's 
Office of Malvar, Batangas.
[32]




The Ruling of the Court of Appeals



By Decision
[33]
 dated March 
28, 2019, the Court of Appeals affirmed. It noted that contrary to the 
submission of the OSG, the requirements under Article 422 of the New 
Civil Code
[34]
 are inapplicable here. For the provision comes into play only when the applicant invokes Section 14(2) of PD 1529
[35]
 to support its application for registration of title.
[36]





As for respondent's compliance with the requirements of Section 14(1) of
 PD 1529, the Court of Appeals held that the totality of respondent's 
evidence sufficiently established its continuous, exclusive, and 
notorious possession and occupation of the property since June 12, 1945 
or earlier.
[37]



The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration on July 9, 2019.


The Present Petition



The Republic, through the OSG now asks the Court to exercise its 
discretionary appellate jurisdiction to review and reverse the assailed 
issuances of the Court of Appeals.
[38]



It brings to fore the two (2) ways by which to acquire and register 
property under PD 1529, viz.: through (1) open, continuous, exclusive 
and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable 
lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since 
June 12, 1945 under Section 14(1) of PD 1529; and, (2) acquisition of 
private lands by prescription under Section 14(2) of the same law. 
Regardless of the ground invoked, however, respondent failed to comply 
with the requirements of law for registration of property.





Respondent failed to establish that it has been, by itself or through 
its predecessors-in-interest, in open, continuous, exclusive, and 
notorious possession of the property since June 12, 1945 or earlier. 
Based on its own declarations, respondent and its 
predecessors-in-interest could only trace its ownership of Lot No. 3394 
beginning 
1940s
 - a timeframe too ambiguous to even deserve any credibility.
[39]



Further, under the second mode, it is not sufficient for respondent to 
offer various certifications from appropriate government agencies 
describing the property as alienable and disposable. Before lands in the
 public domain are converted to patrimonial property, there must also be
 an express government manifestation that the property is no longer 
retained for public service or the development of national wealth under 
Article 422 of the New Civil Code. It is only upon such declaration that
 a property has become patrimonial can the prescriptive period for the 
acquisition of such property of the public dominion begin to run.
[40]
 Here, respondent offered no proof of such government declaration.




In its 
Comment
,
[41]
 
respondent counters that the OSG has merely reiterated its arguments in 
its petition which the Court of Appeals had already passed upon in full.
 In any event, it anchors its application for original registration of 
title on Section 14(1), PD 1529. Thus, it is only required to prove 
that: (1) the land forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of 
the public domain; (2) the applicant by itself and its 
predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and 
notorious possession and occupation thereof; and (3) it has been in 
possession of the property under a bona fide claim of ownership since 
June 12, 1945 or earlier.
[42]
 
Notably, it was able to duly establish these requirements through 
competent evidence, among them the Land Classification Map No. 3601 
issued by the NAMRIA; DENR Administrative Order No. 97-37; CENRO 
Certification which verified the classification of the property as 
within alienable and disposable zone of the public domain; and the 
testimonies of its witnesses.
[43]



As for the OSG's argument that it was only able to produce tax 
declarations for 1949, 1966, 1974, 1980, 1985, 1994-1999 and 2004, 
respondent argues that tax declarations are not conclusive evidence of 
ownership. Hence, other pieces of evidence may be presented to establish
 actual possession and occupation, as it did here. Any prior 
irregularity in the payment of real property taxes should not be taken 
against its cause.
[44]

Respondent, thus, maintains that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled in its favor.


Issues



Under which framework in Section 14 of PD 1529 should the Court evaluate respondent's application for registration of title?



Did respondent sufficiently establish the requisites for land registration under the governing provision?


Ruling



We reverse.






Respondent applied for registration of title under Section 14(1) of PD 1529


 







Section 14, PD 1529 enumerates the valid grounds for registration of title to land, 
viz
.:


Section 14. Who may apply. The following persons may tile in
 the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of 
title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized 
representatives:








(1)


Those who by themselves or
 through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, 
exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and 
disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of 
ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.














(2)


Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provision of existing laws.














(3) 


Those who have acquired ownership of private 
lands or abandoned river beds by right of accession or accretion under 
the existing laws.














(4) 


Those who have acquired ownership of land in any other manner provided for by law. (emphases added)






Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic of the Philippines
[45]
 aptly drew the distinctions between the first and the second grounds, thus:


(1) In connection with Section 14(1) of the Property 
Registration Decree, Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act recognizes and
 confirms that "
those who by themselves or through their predecessors
 in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious 
possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the 
public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership, 
since June 12, 1945
" have acquired ownership of, and registrable title to, such lands based on the length and quality of their possession.


(a) Since Section 48(b) merely requires possession since 12 
June 1945 and does not require that the lands should have been alienable
 and disposable during the entire period of possession, the possessor is
 entitled to secure judicial confirmation of his title thereto as soon 
as it is declared alienable and disposable, subject to the timeframe 
imposed by Section 47 of the Public Land Act.


(b) The right to register granted under Section 48(b) of the Public Land
 Act is further confirmed by Section 14(1) of the Property Registration 
Decree.


(2) In complying with Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree, consider that under the Civil Code, 
prescription is recognized as a mode of acquiring ownership of patrimonial property
. However, public domain lands become 
only patrimonial property not only with a declaration that these are alienable or disposable
. 
There must 
also be an express government manifestation

 that the property is already patrimonial or no longer retained for 
public service or the development of national wealth, under Article 422 
of the Civil Code.
 And only when the property has become patrimonial
 can the prescriptive period for the acquisition of property of the 
public dominion begin to run.


(a) Patrimonial property is private proper1y of the 
government. The person acquires ownership of patrimonial property by 
prescription under the Civil Code is entitled to secure registration 
thereof under Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree.




(b) There are two kinds of prescription by which patrimonial property 
may be acquired, one ordinary and other extraordinary. Under ordinary 
acquisitive prescription, a person acquires ownership of a patrimonial 
property through possession for at least ten (10) years, in good faith 
and with just title. Under extraordinary acquisitive prescription, a 
person's uninterrupted adverse possession of patrimonial property for at
 least thirty (30) years, regardless of good faith or just title, ripens
 into ownership. (emphases and underscoring added)



In fine, an applicant invoking Section 14(1) of PD 1529 needs to prove 
the following elements: (a) the property forms part of the disposable 
and alienable lands of the public domain at the time of the filing of 
the application for registration; (b) it has been, by itself or through 
its predecessors-inÂ­interest, in open, continuous, exclusive, and 
notorious possession and occupation of the property; and (c) the 
possession is under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, 
or earlier.
[46]





On the other hand, an application for registration based on Section 
14(2) of PD 1529 must establish the following requisites: (a) the land 
is an alienable and disposable, and patrimonial property of the public 
domain; (b) the applicant and its predecessors-in-interest have been in 
possession of the land for at least 10 years, in good faith and with 
just title, or for at least 30 years, regardless of good faith or just 
title; and 
(c) the land had already been converted to or declared as 
patrimonial property of the State at the beginning of the said 10-year 
or 30-year period of possession
.
[47]













 
 


Here, the OSG claims that respondent failed to offer proof of an express
 government manifestation that the subject property is no longer 
retained for public service or the development of national wealth in 
accordance with Article 422 of the New Civil Code. Notably though, this 
is required for applications under 
Section 14(2) of PD 1529
 only.



As stated, respondent filed its application under 
Section 14(1) of PD 1529
.
 It consistently claimed that by itself or through its 
predecessors-in-interest, it had been in open, continuous, exclusive, 
and notorious possession and occupation of the subject property since 
June 12, 1945 or even earlier. It never alleged acquiring the subject 
property through acquisitive prescription. Thus, Article 422 of the 
Civil Code does not come into play here.








Respondent failed to 
establish that it has been, by itself or through its 
predecessors-inÂ­interest, in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious 
possession of the property since June 12, 1945 or earlier


 







To reiterate, respondent is tasked to establish three requisites: (a) 
the property forms part of the disposable and alienable lands of the 
public domain at the time of the filing of the application for 
registration; (b) it has been, by itself or through its 
predecessors-in-interest, in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious 
possession and occupation of the property; and (c) the possession is 
under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.





Here, the OSG essentially asserts that respondent failed to establish the second and third requisites in the present case.



We agree.



Preliminarily, the OSG's main argument - that respondent's documentary 
and testimonial evidence failed to establish ifs supposed right to a 
registrable title, involves a purely factual issue requiring 
recalibration of evidence which is generally beyond the purview of the 
Court. This rule, however, admits of exceptions
[48]

 which obtain here. Specifically, the assailed dispositions of the Court
 of Appeals were based on misapprehension of facts, if not contrary to 
law and prevailing jurisprudence.








 


The case is by no means novel. In fact, it is on all fours with 
Republic v. Science Park of the Philippines, Inc.
, G.R. No. 237714 dated November 12, 2018.
[49]

 That case involved the same parties, issues, attendant circumstances, 
and pieces of documentary and testimonial evidence. The only distinction
 between the two cases hinges on the identity of the subject properties 
which nevertheless are both situated in Malvar, Batangas, and the 
persons from whom respondent bought these properties.



The predecessors-in-interest here and in G.R. No. 237714 were armed with
 tax declarations from the Municipal Assessor's Office in Malvar, 
Batangas. In both cases, the earliest tax declaration presented 
pertained to year 
1955
. Too, for the purpose of proving 
possession of the subject property in the concept of owner since June 
12, 1945 or earlier, respondent offered the testimony of octogenarian 
Nelia Linatoc-Cabalda in G.R. 237714, just as how he presented the 
testimony of octogenarian Eliseo Garcia in the present case. Both Nelia 
and Eliseo gave similar testimonies: they personally knew of the subject
 properties and their respective owners; and when they were about seven 
(7) years old, they played and gathered fruits from the subject 
properties together with their friends.




 



 
In evaluating these pieces of evidence in G.R. No. 237714, the Court ruled:


For purposes of land registration under Section 14(1) of PD 
1529 proof of specific acts of ownership must be presented to 
substantiate the claim of open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious 
possession and occupation of the land subject of the application. Actual
 possession consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of
 such a nature as a party would actually exercise over his own property.
 Possession is: (
a
) 
open
 when it is patent visible, apparent, notorious, and not clandestine; (
b
) 
continuous
 when uninterrupted, unbroken, and not intermittent or occasional; (
c
) 
exclusive

 when the adverse possessor can show exclusive dominion over the land 
and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit; and (
d
) 
notorious
 when it is so conspicuous that it is generally known and talked of by the public or the people in the neighborhood.




To prove that it and its predecessors-in-interest have been in 
possession and occupation of the subject land since June 12, 1945 or 
earlier, SPPI presented, among others, 
the testimony of Nelia 
Linatoc-Cabalda (Nelia). Nelia, who was born in 1936, claimed to have 
known of Gervacio's ownership and cultivation of the subject land when 
she was about seven (7) years old
, xxx However, such testimony 
was 
insufficient
 to establish possession in the nature and character required by law that would give right to ownership
.
 In a number of cases, the Court has repeatedly held that to prove open,
 continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation in the 
concept of owner, the claimant must show the nature and extent of 
cultivation on the subject land, or the number of crops planted or the 
volume of the produce harvested from the crops supposedly planted 
thereon; 
failing in which, the supposed planting and harvesting of 
crops in the land being claimed only amounted to mere casual cultivation
 which is 
not
 the nature of possession and occupation required by law.
 Consequently, SPPI 
failed
 to satisfy the requisite exclusivity and notoriety of its claimed 
possession and occupation of the subject land because exclusive dominion
 and conspicuous possession thereof were not established
.




Furthermore, SPPI's evidence were 
insufficient to prove that its possession and occupation were for the duration required by law
. The 
earliest tax declaration
 in Gervacio's name presented by SPPI, i.e., Tax Declaration (TD) No. 6243, dates back to 
1955

 only, short of the requirement that possession and occupation under a 
bona tide claim of ownership should be since June 12, 1945 or earlier. 
xxx The payment of realty taxes and declaration of the subject land in 
the name of Gervacio in 1955 gives rise to the presumption that 
he claimed ownership and possession thereof only in that year
.


ln sum, the Court finds that SPPI's 
unsubstantiated and selfÂ­serving assertions of possession and occupation

 do not constitute the well-nigh incontrovertible evidence of possession
 and occupation of the subject land of the nature and duration required 
by Section 14(1) of PD 1529
. Accordingly, the CA erred in affirming 
the MCTC's grant of SPPI's application for original registration of its 
imperfect title over the subject land. (Emphases supplied; citations 
omitted)



Verily, the Court deemed Nelia's testimony 
insufficient
 for 
purposes of establishing the nature and extent of possession required by
 law. For she testified on events which supposedly happened when she was
 only about seven (7) years old. At any rate, the planting and 
harvesting of crops she allegedly witnessed merely amounted to casual 
cultivation and did not rise to the level of exclusivity and notoriety 
of possession required by law. Notably, too, the earliest tax 
declarations offered by respondent in G.R. No. 237714 was dated 
1955
 - short of the reckoning point required under Section 14(1) of PD 1529.



Here, the same respondent also seeks to register another parcel of land 
in Malvar, Batangas. As in G.R. No. 237714, respondent presented an 
octogenarian witness, albeit a different one, in the person of Eliseo 
Garcia who nonetheless gave a strikingly similar story as Nelia's in 
G.R. No. 237714. Finally, respondent also offered intermittent tax 
declarations, the earliest of which was dated 1955, as in G.R. No. 
237714.



In light of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds no reason to 
deviate from its ruling in G.R. No. 237714. Stare decisis et non quieta 
movere. When a court has laid down a principle of law applicable to a 
certain set of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to 
all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same.
[50]
 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. The Insular Life Assurance Co Ltd.
[51]
 elucidates:


Stare decisis simply means that for the sake of certainty, 
a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same
, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, 
absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike
. Thus, where the 
same questions
 relating to the 
same event
 have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, 
the rule of stare decisis is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue
. (Emphases supplied)


In fine, the present application for land registration should also be dismissed.


ACCORDINGLY
 the petition is 
GRANTED
. The Decision

"From the aforesaid provisions of the Property Registration Decree, we

application for registration of title under the first category, to wit: 
(1) that the property in question is alienable and disposable land of 
the public domain; (2) that the applicants by themselves or through 
their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive

 under a bona fide claim of ownership since 12 June 1945 or earlier. The
 second classification relates to the acquisition of private lands by 
prescription."
