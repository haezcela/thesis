HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the December 22, 2010 Decision
[2]

 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 103349, which reversed 
and set aside the February 18, 2008 Decision[3 and September 24, 2002 
Resolution
[4]
 of the National 
Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) finding that respondents were not 
illegally dismissed. In a September 26, 2011 Resolution,
[5]
 the CA did not reconsider its earlier Decision. 

Antecedent Facts:
 


Respondents Rogelio Ceria, Jesus Alburo, Jr., Gil Clavecillas, 
Domingo Zepeda, Raul Clerigo, Domingo Cantes, Marcelino Copino, Ceazar 
CaÃ±ezo, Levy Legazpi, Eustaquio Rangasa, Elmar Convencido, and Achiles 
Dycoco (respondents) were hired on various dates by Sigma Construction 
and Supply (Sigma), an independent contractor owned by Eduardo G. Jovero
 (Jovero). As cement cutters, respondents were assigned to work at the 
drilling site of Philippine Geothermal Inc. (PGI), beginning in April 
1990. However, PGI preterminated one of its contracts with Sigma on 
April 1, 1993, which was initially supposed to end on October 31, 1993. 
Due to such termination, the project manager of Sigma issued a notice
[6]
 to all cement cutters, informing them that the contract with PGI will be effective only until April 30, 1993.


Sometime in August 1993, respondents filed a complaint
[7]

 for illegal dismissal, underpayment of wages and non-payment oflabor 
standard benefits against Sigma and PGI. Their case was later on 
consolidated with the cases of Job Capis, 
et al
. and Crispino Miguel, 
et. al
. Thereafter, Executive Labor Arbiter Vito C. Bote (Executive Labor Arbiter Bote) rendered a March 30, 1994 Decision
[8]

 dismissing the complaints for lack of merit. However, Jovero was 
ordered to pay each of the respondents P1,000.00 as indemnity. The 
complainants in the Capis,
 et. al
. and Miguel et. al. cases filed an appeal to the Commission on April 27, 1994, while the complainants in the Ceria 
et. al
. case appealed on May 4, 1994. Hence, all records of the three (3) cases were forwarded to the Commission.


On March 31, 1995, the Third Division of the Commission rendered a Decision
[9]

 remanding the cases to the Arbitration Branch of origin for the 
determination of the legality of complainants' dismissal and their 
nature of employment. It also pointed out in its dispositive portion 
that only Capis 
et. al
. and Miguel 
et. al
. filed an 
appeal. After remand of the records of the said cases to the branch of 
origin, Executive Labor Arbiter Bote rendered a Decision and restated 
his earlier findings and conclusion in his March 1994 Decision. On the 
other hand, it was only in 1996 when the Cerio 
et. al
. case was 
remanded to the then new Executive Labor Arbiter Gelacio L. Rivera Jr. 
(Executive Labor Arbiter Rivera). He called the parties to a hearing, 
but they still failed to reach an amicable settlement.


Jovero alleged that Sigma is an independent contractor that hired 
respondents as project employees to work on the former's projects with 
PGI.


Necessarily, when PGI preterminated its latest contract with Sigma, 
the latter was forced to terminate the employment of respondents seeing 
that the need for their services was dependent on its contract with PGI.
 Simply put, respondents' services were coterminous with Sigma's 
projects with PGI. Therefore, they were hired and rehired in accordance 
with the duration of Sigma's contracts with PGI. Consequently, Jovero 
averred that it would be unjust to require Sigma to retain respondents 
in its employ in the absence of projects with PGI. Nevertheless, he 
claimed that the respondents were paid wages and benefits in accordance 
with the law.


 On the other hand, respondents argued that they were not just 
project employees because they were continuously hired and assigned to 
different PGI projects from the beginning of their employment in 1990 
until their recent termination in 1993. In fact, respondents were even 
transferred to other projects prior to the completion of a previously 
assigned project. They also claimed that they were not limited to 
performing work as cement cutters, but they also cleaned canals and 
pipes, fixed tools, and other related work at PGI.

On July 31, 2011, Executive Labor Arbiter Rivera rendered a Decision,
[10]

SO ORDERED.
[11]




The arbiter held that herein respondents were regular employees of 
Sigma considering that they: (1) were continuously hired and employed 
for more than a year; (2) were transferred to various projects even 
prior to the completion of a previously assigned project; and (3) 
performed tasks not limited to being cement cutters. Moreover, 
petitioner did not submit any evidence to controvert these allegations. 
Petitioner should have submitted employment records such as appointment 
papers or contracts of employment for a specific project to show that 
respondents were only hired for such specific purpose or phase of a 
project. Furthermore, it held that petitioner should have adduced in 
evidence the termination report submitted to the Department of Labor and
 Employment (DOLE) every time its employees' services were terminated 
upon the completion or termination of the project they were assigned to.
 As regular employees, the Labor Arbiter found that they were illegally 
dismissed due to petitioner's failure to abide by the notice and just 
cause requirements under the Labor Code. As such, they were entitled to 
separation pay instead of reinstatement, as well as backwages. Anent the
 issue on labor standard benefits, the same was denied for respondents' 
failure to substantiate its claim.


Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission:


 In its September 21, 2001 Memorandum on Appeal
[12]

 to the NLRC, petitioner averred that the Labor Arbiter abused his 
discretion in finding that respondents were regular employees of Sigma 
and that they were illegally dismissed. He attached Sigma's contracts
[13]

 with PGI and reiterated that the hiring and rehiring of respondents 
were based on the duration of the contracts (1) from May 1, 1990 
-December 31, 1990; (2) August 1, 1991 - October 31, 1991; (3) May 1, 
1992- April 30, 1993; and (4) January 1, 1993 -October 31, 1993. As 
project employees, he posited that their employment may be terminated 
upon completion or expiration of the project for which they have been 
engaged in. Accordingly, PGI's pretermination of the contract with Sigma
 entailed respondents' termination as well. He also added that the tasks
 performed by respondents did not pertain to different kinds of work. As
 shown in PGI's contract with Sigma, cleaning canals and pipes and 
fixing tools are under the latter's Scope of Work.
[14]


 In their Opposition to Memorandum on Appeal,
[15]

 respondents averred that the arbiter's Decision had already become 
final and executory considering that the ten-day period within which to 
appeal had already lapsed before petitioner filed his appeal.


 In its September 24, 2002 Resolution,
[16]

 the labor tribunal granted the appeal and dismissed the cases for lack 
of merit. However, it ordered the payment of P 1,000.00 to each 
complainant for petitioner's failure to submit a termination report to 
the DOLE. The dispositive portion of the Resolution states: 


WHEREFORE, the appeal of respondent Sigma Construction and Supply is hereby 
GRANTED
. Accordingly, the decision of the Executive Labor Arbiter dated July 31,2001 is hereby 
VACATED
 and 
SET ASIDE
 and another judgment entered 
DISMISSING

 the above-entitled cases for lack of merit. However, Sigma Construction
 and Supply is hereby ordered to pay each of the complainants the sum of
 P 1,000.00 by way of penalty imposed on it for failure to observe the 
requirements of the Labor Code.


SO ORDERED.
[17]


The NLRC noted that Executive Labor Arbiter Bote made a general 
finding that upon expiration of a Service Contract with PGI, the 
employment of workers is deemed terminated since there was no evidence 
showing that they belong to a work pool from which the petitioner could 
utilize them in another project. On the other hand, Executive Labor 
Arbiter Rivera found that in the absence of a specific Service Contract 
with specific duration, the employment of respondents is deemed to be 
continuous and regular.


However, the NLRC noted that in his Memorandum of Appeal, petitioner 
has attached these service contracts. Thus, in the interest of 
substantial justice and prevailing jurisprudence on the matter, it 
admitted the evidence, though belatedly submitted. Moreover, it pointed 
out that respondents failed to dispute the genuineness and authenticity 
of such contracts, despite having the opportunity to do so. Therefore, 
the contracts indubitably proved that respondents' employment is 
coterminous with the completion or termination of each project.


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
 


Aggrieved, respondents filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
[18]

 before the CA alleging grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
in excess of jurisdiction on the part of the labor tribunal when it gave
 due course to Jovero's appeal despite filing it beyond the reglementary
 period, and holding that respondents were project employees who were 
legally terminated.


 In his Comment
[19]
 to respondents' Petition for 
Certiorari
,
 petitioner averred that the NLRC aptly decided the case on the merits 
rather than mere technicality, in the higher interest of substantial 
justice. He also maintained that respondents were project employees. 
Thus, the award of backwages and separation pay was without basis.


 In compliance with its July 3, 2009 Resolution,
[20]
 the respective parties filed their respective memoranda
[21]
 with the CA.


On December 22, 2010, the CA rendered its assailed Decision
[22]
 granting respondents' Petition for 
Certiorari

 and setting aside the September 24, 2002 Resolution and February 18, 
2008 Decision of the NLRC. The dispositive portion of the Decision 
states: 


WHEREFORE
, the Petition is 
GRANTED
. The assailed Resolution and Decision of NLRC, promulgated on September 24, 2002 and February 18, 2008, respectively, are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. The Decision, dated July 31, 2001 by Executive Labor Arbiter Gelacio L. Rivera, Jr., is hereby ordered 
REINSTATED
.


SO ORDERED.
[23]


The CA found that the petitioner's appeal to the NLRC was belatedly filed. It gave credence to the Bailiff Proof of Service
[24]
 and Notice of Judgment/Final Order
[25]

 attached to respondents' Opposition to Memorandum on Appeal, showing 
that petitioner's counsel, through his employee, received the Decision 
on August 21, 2001 and not on September 11, 2001 as stated in 
petitioner's Memorandum on Appeal. Thus, the last day to file the appeal
 fell on August 31, 2001. Additionally, even if the CA brushes aside 
this procedural lapse, it concluded that respondents were regular 
employees and concurred with Executive Labor Arbiter Rivera's findings, 
to wit:


As complainant's assertion that they continuously worked 
with respondent assigned at PGI in its different projects and were in 
fact transferred to other projects even before its completion or were 
also assigned to work other than their original assignment were not 
disproved by respondent by way of evidence, complainants, clearly are 
not project employees by regular employees of respondent.
[26]


Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[27]
 but the CA denied the same in its September 26, 2011 Resolution.
[28]
 Hence, the instant Petition.



Issues


Petitioner raised the following issues: (1) whether the appeal 
belatedly filed by the petitioner before the NLRC can be given due 
course; and (2) whether respondents were regular employees and illegally
 dismissed by the petitioner.


Our Ruling


We find no merit in the petition.


To begin with, it is clear that the present petition was filed out of
 time. There is no dispute that petitioner received the copy of the CA 
Resolution dated September 26, 2011 on October 5, 2011. The period 
within which to file a petition for review under Rule 45 is fifteen (15)
 days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed 
from. Thus, petitioner had until October 20, 2011 to file his petition. 
However, records show that the present petition was filed only on July 
19, 2012, or about nine (9) months after the lapse of the reglementary 
period. Petitioner claims that he was working abroad as an OFW and 
returned only on July 6, 2012. During the interim, petitioner was not 
able to communicate to his counsel his intention to file a Petition for 
Review on 
Certiorari
. This Court finds petitioner's justification
 unsubstantiated, as no travel records were even provided by petitioner 
to support his claim. Notwithstanding the technical infirmities, this 
Court deems it judicious to take cognizance of the case to put the 
issues to rest.
[29]
 


The question on whether respondents are project employees is a 
question of fact. As general rule, a petition for review under Rule 45 
should only raise questions of law, as this Court is not a trier of 
facts.
[30]
 However, this Court
 may exercise its equity jurisdiction when the findings of facts and 
conclusions of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA are conflicting with each
 other.
[31]
 In the present 
case, the findings of the Labor Arbiter and CA on one hand, and the NLRC
 on the other, differ from each other. Consequently, the conflicting 
verdicts of the lower tribunals constrain this Court to invoke its 
equity jurisdiction and review the records of the case to arrive at its 
own conclusion.
[32]


According to the CA, the NLRC gravely abused its discretion when it 
gave due course to Jovero's appeal, which was filed twenty-one (21) days
 after the lapse of the reglementary period for filing an appeal. 
Moreover, the circumstances did not warrant the liberal application of 
rules since Jovero did not provide any explanation which would justify 
his belated filing.


We agree.


When a party is represented by counsel of record, service of orders and notices must be made upon such counsel.
[33]
 As a well-settled rule, such notice to counsel is tantamount to notice to the client.
[34]

 Similarly, the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure (NLRC Rules) governing the 
issuance and service of notices and resolutions provides: 


Section 4. 
Service of Notices, Resolutions, Orders and Decisions
.-
 a) Notices and copies of resolutions or orders, shall be served 
personally upon the parties by the bailiff or duly authorized public 
officer within three (3) days from his/her receipt thereof or by 
registered mail or by private courier;


 b) In case of decisions and final awards, copies thereof shall be 
served on both parties and their counsel or representative by registered
 mail or by private courier; Provided that, in cases where a party to a 
case or his/her counsel on record personally seeks service of the 
decision upon inquiry thereon, service to said party shall be deemed 
effected as herein provided. Where parties are numerous, service shall 
be made on counsel and upon such number of complainants, as may be 
practicable and shall be considered substantial compliance with Article 
224 (a) of the Labor Code, as amended. 
For purposes of appeal, the 
period shall be counted from receipt of such decisions, resolutions, or 
orders by the counsel or representative of record.
 


c) 
The bailiff or officer serving the notice, order, or resolution
 shall submit his/her return within two (2) days from date of service 
thereof, stating legibly in his/her return his/her name, the names of 
the persons served and the date of receipt, which return shall be 
immediately attached and shall form part of the records of the case
.
 In case of service by registered mail or by private courier, the name 
of the addressee and the date of receipt of the notice, order or 
resolution shall be written in the return card or in the proof of 
service issued by the private courier. If no service was effected, the 
reason thereof shall be so stated.
[35]
 (Emphasis ours)


Consideringthat the Bailiff Proof of Service and Notice of 
Judgment/Final Order show that Jovero's counsel received Labor Arbiter 
Rivera's Decision on August 21, 2001, and that the reglementary period 
indubitably lapsed before he filed his appeal, the CA correctly held 
that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion when it took cognizance of 
and even granted Jovero's appeal. Lest we forget, perfection of an 
appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is not a 
mere technicality, but jurisdictional.
[36]
 Hence, failure to perfect an appeal as required by the Rules renders the judgment final and executory.
[37]
 The case of 
Paramount Vinyl Products Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission
[38]
 is instructive:


Well-settled rule that the perfection of an appeal within
 the statutory or reglementary period is not only mandatory, but 
jurisdictional. Failure to interpose a timely appeal (or a motion for 
reconsideration) renders the assailed decision, order or award final and
 executory that deprives the appellate body of any jurisdiction to alter
 the final judgment. x x x The rule is 'applicable indiscriminately to 
one and all since the rule is grounded on fundamental consideration of 
public policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional error, 
the judgment of courts and award of quasi-judicial agencies must become 
final at some definite date fixed by law.'
[39]


Thus, in 
Mai Philippines Inc., v. National Labor Relations Commission
,
[40]
 We held:


So, too, it was clearly wrong, and in grave abuse of 
discretion, for the Commission to fail or refuse to take account of the 
fact-clearly shown by the record and to which its attention had 
repeatedly been drawn -that the appeal taken by Nolasco from the 
decision of Arbiter Lasquite of August 2, 1984, dismissing his 
complaint, was late, because perfected on September 24, 1984, twelve 
(12) days after service on him of notice of the decision on September 
12, 1984, the reglementary period for appeal being fixed by the Labor 
Code at ten (10) days. No acceptable reason has been advanced by 
Nolasco, and none appears upon the record, to excuse his tardiness in 
the taking of the appeal. MAI's opposition to the appeal should have 
been sustained, and the NLRC should never have taken cognizance of the 
appeal. In doing so, and in resolving the appeal adversely to MAI, it 
acted so whimsically, capriciously and arbitrarily as to call for this 
Court's correcting hand.
[41]
 (Citations omitted)


While this Court is mindful that procedural lapses have been 
previously disregarded and appeals filed beyond the reglementary period 
have been given due course, it necessitates strong and compelling 
reasons to do so.
[42]
 In the 
present case, the CA correctly held that the absence of such exceptional
 circumstances to justify the belated filing of an appeal with the NLRC 
rendered Labor Arbiter Rivera's Decision final and executory.


 Nevertheless, even setting aside the issue on filing an appeal 
beyond the reglementary period, this Court concurs with the findings and
 conclusions of the Labor Arbiter and the appellate court that 
respondents were regular employees of Sigma.


Petitioner supports his argument that respondents are only project 
employees by attaching Sigma's Service contracts with PGI in its 
Memorandum of Appeal filed with the NLRC. Petitioner cites the case of 
Cartagenas v. Romago Electric Co., Inc.
[43]
 (
Cartegenas
)
 as a similar factual milieu, which held that the employees were not 
permanent or regular employees since the duration of their employment 
was coterminous with the projects they were assigned to. However, 
Cartagenas is strikingly different from the present case.


In 
Cartagenas
, the employer was able to present documentary 
exhibits which showed that the employees were assigned to various 
projects over a period of time. The documents also proved that they were
 temporarily laid off when the project was suspended, and subsequently 
rehired once it resumed. In that case, they were able to present the 
project employment contracts between the employer and its employees. 
Contrastingly, Jovero only presented Sigma's Service Contracts with PGL 
Nowhere in the contracts did it show that respondents were parties to 
such contract. More importantly, it did not prove that respondents were 
hired for the projects with PGI.


 The case of 
Olongapo Maintenance Services, Inc. v. Chantengco
[44]
 is more applicable: 


The principal test in determining whether an employee is a
 project employee is whether he/she is assigned to carry out a "specific
 project or undertaking," the duration and scope of which are specified 
at the time the employee is engaged in the project, or where the work or
 service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for
 the duration of the season. A true project employee should be assigned 
to a project which begins and ends at determined or determinable times, 
and be informed thereof at the time of hiring.

In the instant case, the record is bereft of proof that the respondents'
 engagement as project employees has been predetermined, as required by 
law. 
We agree with the Court of Appeals that OMSI did not provide 
convincing evidence that respondents were informed that they were to be 
assigned to a "specific project or undertaking" when OMSI hired them. 
Notably, the employment contracts for the specific project signed by the
 respondents were never presented. All that OMSI submitted in the 
proceedings a quo are the service contracts between OMSI and the MIAA. 
Clearly, OMSI utterly failed to establish by substantial evidence that, 
indeed, respondents were project employees and their employment was 
coterminous with the MIAA contract
.
[45]
 (Citations omitted; Emphasis ours)


Clearly, the presentation of service contracts between the employer 
and their client (even if it shows the duration of the project), in lieu
 of the employees' individual employment contracts, does not establish 
that the latter are project employees. There was no other substantial 
evidence offered to prove that respondents were informed at the time of 
their hiring, that they were project employees. Moreover, petitioner's 
failure to file termination reports at the end of each project was an 
indication that respondents were regular employees.
[46]


In view of all the foregoing, petitioner failed to prove through 
substantial evidence that respondents are project employees. It is 
evident that respondents were illegally dismissed due to petitioner's 
failure to comply with the substantive and procedural due process tenets
 under the Labor Code.
