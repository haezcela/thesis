LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case

 


This petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 seeks to reverse and set aside the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 139311:








a)


 Decision
[2]

 dated July 12, 2018, affirming the pronouncement of the National Labor 
and Relations Commission (NLRC) that petitioner Philippine National 
Construction Corporation (PNCC) is not a government-owned and controlled
 corporation (GOCC) and its consequent directive for PNCC to release the
 2013 mid-year bonus of its employees; and
 














b) 


Resolution
[3]
 dated July 15, 2019, denying PNCC's motion for reconsideration.






Antecedents



ln 1966, PNCC was originally incorporated pursuant to the Corporation 
Code of the Philippines under the name Construction Development 
Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP). On March 31, 1977, Presidential 
Decre No. 1113
[4]
 (PD 1113) 
granted CDCP a thirty (30) year franchise to construct, operate, and 
maintain toll facilities in the North and South Luzon Tollways. In 
December 1983, Presidential Decree No. 1894
[5]
 (PD 1894) amended PD 1113 to include the Metro Manila Expressway into the CDCP's franchise.





In the course of its operations, CDCP obtained loans from various 
Government Financing Institutions (GFIs). On February 23, 1983, 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Letter of Instruction No. 1295 (LOI
 1295), directing the GFIs to convert all CDCP's unpaid obligations to 
them into shares of stock.
[6]
 
The implementation of said LOI thus made the GFIs majority stockholders 
of PNCC. By virtue of the debt-to-equity conversion of CDCP loans, 
CDCP's Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws were later amended to 
change its corporate name from CDCP to PNCC to reflect the extent of the
 Government's equity investment in the company.
[7]



In 1986, pursuant to the government's privatization program, President 
Corazon C. Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation No. 50 (PP50) 
creating the Asset Privatization Trust (APT), now known as the 
Privatization and Management Office (PMO), as trustee of the equity 
shares of the GFIs in PNCC. Subsequently, President Gloria 
Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive Order No. 331 (EO 331), placing PNCC 
under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
[8]




In 1992, PNCC started giving mid-year bonuses to its employees every fifteenth (15
th
)
 of May pursuant to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with its 
then employees' union. Long after the CBA expired though, the grant of 
mid-year bonus to the employees continued until 2012.
[9]





Meantime, on April 30, 2013, petitioner Atty. Luis F. Sison, then PNCC 
President and Chief Executive Officer sought the opinion of PNCC's 
statutory counsel , the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel 
(OGCC) on the release of mid-year bonus for the year 2013
[10]
 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1597 (PD 1597).
[11]



By Letter dated May 10, 2013, the OGCC advised PNCC to secure the 
approval of the Governance Commission for Government Owned or Controlled
 Corporations (GCG), citing Section 8 of Republic Act No. 10149 (RA 
10149).
[12]



Consequently, under Letter dated May 29, 2013, PNCC sought GCG's approval for the grant of mid-year bonus to is employees.
[13]



In its Letter-Reply dated June 20, 2013, the GCG advised PNCC that it 
was not forwarding the request for approval to then President Benigno 
Aquino III because the grant was legally infirm and its abrogation does 
not violate the non-diminution rule.
[14]



Pursuant thereto, Atty. Sison circulated a memorandum to all PNCC 
employees informing them that the 2013 Mid-year Bonus shall not be 
released.
[15]



Acting thereon, the PNCC employees filed before the NLRC Arbitration 
Branch a complaint for non-payment of mid-year bonus and diminution of 
wages and benefits.
[16]


The Ruling of the Labor Arbiter



By Decision
[17]
 dated January 
29, 2014, Labor Arbiter Romelita Rioflorido ordered PNCC to give 
respondents their mid-year bonus for 2013, and every year thereafter in 
the amount equivalent to one month of their respective salaries, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE, a decision is hereby rendered finding the 
respondent Philippine National Construction Corporation to have violated
 the nonÂ­diminution clause under Article 100 of the Labor Code of the 
Philippines and hereby ordered to give all complainants their annual 
mid-year bonus for the year 2013, and every year thereafter, in the 
amount equivalent to one (1) month of their respective salaries.




SO ORDERED.
[18]


The labor arbiter held that the practice of granting mid-year bonus to 
PNCC employees since 1992 had ripened into a benefit or supplement which
 may not be reduced, diminished, discontinued, or eliminated in 
accordance with Article 100 of the Labor Code on non-diminution of 
benefits.
[19]


The Ruling of the NLRC



In its Decision
[20]
 dated June
 6, 2014, the NLRC affirmed. It held that PNCC is not a GOCC since - it 
was created under the Corporation Code of the Philippines. Too, PNCC 
remains to be a private corporation despite the fact that the government
 is its majority stockholder. As such, it is covered by the provisions 
of the Labor Code, not by the Civil Service laws. Too, the grant need 
not be subject to the approval by the President as required under PD 
1567 and RA 10149.
[21]



PNCC moved for reconsideration
[22]
 which was denied under Resolution
[23]
 dated December 19, 2014.



PNCC, thereafter, filed a petition for 
certiorari
 against the foregoing dispositions of the NLRC through CA-G.R. SP No. 139311.
[24]



Meantime, the employees moved for execution pending appeal which the labor arbiter granted
[25]
 and the NLRC subsequently affirmed by Resolution
[26]

 dated March 30, 2015. Thus, PNCC went back to the Court of Appeals 
through CA-G.R. SP No. 140997 questioning the grant of the motion for 
execution pending appeal.


Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals



CA-G.R. SP No. 139311 and CA-G.R. SP No. 140997 got consolidated, albeit
 subsequently, the cases were separately disposed of by the appellate 
court.



In CA-G.R. SP No. 140997, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition on
 the ground that PNCC failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the
 assailed ruling of the NLRC.
[27]
 PNCC moved for reconsideration which was denied under Resolution
[28]
 dated March 31, 2016. In G.R. Nos. 223867-68, the Court affirmed the foregoing dispositions, with finality under Resolution
[29]
 dated October 12, 2016.



Meantime, in CA-G.R. SP No. 139311, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision
[30]

 dated July 12, 2018, affirming the status of PNCC as a private 
corporation. It further pronounced that even assuming PNCC to be a GOCC,
 PD 1597 and RA 10149 are inapplicable to GOCCs without original 
charter, like PNCC.
[31]



Citing 
PNCC v. Pabion
[32]
 and 
Cuenca v. Hon. Altas
,
[33]

 the Court of Appeals held that PNCC is an acquired asset corporation 
and not a GOCC. Notwithstanding the fact that the government is the 
majority stockholder of PNCC, the latter remains to be a private 
corporation within the coverage of the Labor Code, not the Civil Service
 Law.
[34]



Further, the Couti of Appeals ruled that the failure of PNCC to release 
the employees' 2013 mid-year bonus violated the non-diminution clause 
under Article 100 of the Labor Code.
[35]



By Resolution
[36]
 dated July 15, 2019, PNCC's motion for reconsideration
[37]
 was denied.


The Present Petition



PNCC now asks the Court to reverse and set aside the questioned rulings 
of the Court of Appeals. PNCC posits that the 1999 case of 
PNCC v. Pabion
 is no longer relevant in determining the real status of PNCC.



For while PNCC was organized under the Corporation Code, it is a GOCC, as ordained by Section 3 (o) and (p) of RA 10149.
[38]

 As such, it is not governed by the Labor Code, hence, it may validly 
refuse to grant the mid-year bonus without violating the non-diminution 
clause under the Labor Code.


 
In their Comment
[39]
 dated January 29, 2021, respondents riposte that as enunciated in 
Pabion
,
 PNCC remains to be a private corporation notwithstanding that majority 
of its shares of stock is owned by the government. As a private entity, 
its expenditures and disbursements are not subject to the guidelines and
 requirements under PD 1597 and RA 10149; and PNCC employees are covered
 by the provisions of the Labor Code.
[40]



Granting for the sake of argument that PNCC is not contractually bound 
to give the bonus in question, the fact that for no less than twenty 
(20) uninterrupted years, it was granted to the employees as part of an 
established company practice; the same has become part of the employees'
 salary or wage. To cease this grant amounts to diminution of benefits 
in violation of Article 100 of the Labor Code.
[41]


Issues


Is PNCC a private corporation or a government owned and controlled corporation (GOCC)?




Are PNCC employees covered by the provisions of the Labor Code or by the Civil Service Law?




Is PNCC governed by RA 10149?



Ruling






PNCC is a non-chartered government owned and controlled corporation


 







In 
Strategic Alliance v. Radstock Securities
,
[42]
 the Court pronounced with finality that PNCC is a GOCC, 
viz
.:


The PNCC is not 'just like any other private corporation 
precisely because it is not a private corporation' but indisputably 
government owned corporation.
 Neither is PNCC 
"an autonomous entity"

 considering that PNCC is under the Department of Trade and Industry, 
over which the President exercises control. To claim that PNCC is an 
"autonomous entity" is to say that it is a lost command in the Executive
 branch, a concept that violates the President's constitutional power or
 control over the entire Executive branch of government. (Emphasis 
supplied)





The Court emphasized that PNCC is 90.3% owned by the government and may 
not be considered an autonomous entity just because it got incorporated 
under the Corporation Code.











Additionally, Executive Order No. 331, series of 2014 has placed the 
PNCC under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), thus, confirming 
its character as a GOCC, 
viz
.:


WHEREAS
, the Department of Trade and industry (DTI) 
is the primary coordinative, promotive, facilitative and regulatory arm 
of the Executive Branch of government in the area of trade, industry and
 investment;


WHEREAS
, the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) 
holds the franchise to operate the North Luzon and South Luzon 
Expressways;


WHEREAS
, the development of expressways requires huge investments, and it is necessary to place the PNCC under the DTI;


WHEREAS
, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and/or
 government financial institutions have majority ownership of the PNCC, 
which pursuant to PNCC vs. Pabion (320 SCRA 188), may be considered as a
 government owned and/or controlled corporation;


x x x x



Further, Section 6 of PD 1597 ordains that GOCCs are subject to such 
guidelines and policies as may be issued by the President governing 
position classifications, salary rates, levels of allowances, project 
and other honoraria, overtime rates, and other forms of compensation and
 fringe benefits. GOCCs organized under the Corporation Code like PNCC 
are not excluded from the coverage of PD 1597, thus:


SECTION 6. 
Exemptions from OCPC Rules and Regulations
.
 - Agencies positions, or groups of officials and employees of the 
national government, including government owned or controlled 
corporations, who are hereafter exempted by law from OCPC coverage, 
shall observe such guidelines and policies as may be issued by the 
President governing position classification, salary rates, levels of 
allowances, project and other honoraria, overtime rates, and other forms
 of compensation and fringe benefits. Exemptions notwithstanding, 
agencies shall report to the President, through the Budget Commission, 
on their position classification and compensation plans, policies, rates
 and other related details following such specifications as may be 
prescribed by the President.




Verily, therefore, the status of PNCC as a GOCC should now be put to rest.






Being a GOCC without original charter, PNCC is covered by the Labor Code


 







The next question: As a GOCC without original charter, is PNCC governed by the Labor Code or the Civil Service Law?

 


Under Article IX-B, Section 2, paragraph 1 of the 1987 Constitution, 
only GOCCs with original charters are covered by civil service laws, 
viz
.:


SECTION 2. (1) The civil service embraces all branches, 
subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, 
including government-owned or controlled corporations 
with original charters
. (emphasis supplied)





Where a statute, by its terms, is expressly limited to certain matters, 
it may not, by interpretation or construction, be extended to others.
[43]

 Since PNCC is a non-chartered GOCC, incorporated under the Corporation 
Code, it is governed by the Labor Code, not by the Civil Service Law.





In 
Paloma v. Philippine Airlines Inc.
,
[44]

 the Court pronounced that prior to the privatization of the Philippine 
Airlines Inc. (PAL), it was a non-chartered GOCC in the sense that the 
GSIS owned majority of its stockholdings. Consequently, PAL personnel 
were covered by the Labor Code, not by the Civil Service Law. The same 
rule applies to PNCC employees.








But PNCC is not exempt
 from the National Position Classification and Compensation Plan 
approved by the President, as well as the Compensation and Position 
Classification System


 








Although governed by the Labor Code, as a GOCC, PNCC is not exempt from 
the coverage of the National Position Classification and Compensation 
Plan approved by the President. Sections 1 and 4 of RA 10149 state:


Section 1.
 
Statement of Policy
. It is hereby 
declared policy that the officials and employees of the national 
government, including the Judiciary, the Career Executive Service, the 
Foreign Service, the Armed Forces, subordinate officials of 
Constitutional Commissions, 
government owned or controlled corporations
,
 and state colleges and universities, shall be compensated in accordance
 with a National Position Classification and Compensation Plan approved 
by the President. (emphasis supplied.)




x x x x


Section 4.
 
Coverage
. - This Act shall be applicable to 
all GOCCs
,
 GICPs/GCEs, and government financial institutions, including their 
subsidiaries; but excluding the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, state 
universities and colleges, cooperatives, local water districts, economic
 zone authorities and research institutions: 
Provided
, That in economic zone authorities and 
research

 institutions, the President shall appoint oneÂ­third (1/3) of the board 
members from the list submitted by the GCG. (emphasis supplied)




Further, Section 9 of the same law ordains that no GOCC shall be exempt 
from the coverage of the Compensation and Position Classification 
System, thus:


SEC. 9. 
Position Titles and Salary Grades
. - All 
positions in the Positions Classification System, as determine by the 
GCG and as approved by the President, shall be allocated to their proper
 position titles and salary grades in accordance within Index of 
Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades of the 
Compensation and Position Classification System, which shall be prepared
 by the GCG and approved by the President.


x x x x



Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, no GOCC shall be exempt from 
the coverage of the Compensation and Position Classification System 
developed by the GCG under this Act.



Notably, Section 32 of RA 10149 expressly repeals all decrees and issuances inconsistent with its provisions, thus:


SEC. 32. 
Repealing Clause
. - The charters of the 
GOCCs under existing laws and all other laws, executive orders including
 Executive Order No. 323, Series of 2000, administrative orders, rules, 
regulations, decrees and other issuances or parts thereof which are 
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby revoked, 
repealed or modified accordingly.





In 
GSIS Family Bank Employees Union v. Villanueva
,
[45]

 the Court had the occasion to illustrate the interplay between the 
provisions of the Labor Code and the provisions of RA 10149 on the life 
of a non-chattered GOCC.



In that case, employees of GSIS Family Bank demanded for the payment of 
their Christmas bonus which had been annually given them pursuant to 
their CBA with GSIS Family Bank, a non-chartered GOCC. GSIS Family Bank 
was advised by the Governance Commission that in view of the enactment 
of RA 10149, GSIS Family Bank should no longer grant any additional 
benefits to its employees without the requisite authority from the 
President. Thenceforth, GSIS Family Bank stopped granting Christmas 
bonus to its employees. The Court ruled that while GOCCs without 
original chatters are covered by the Labor Code, employees of GOCCs are 
bereft of any right to negotiate the economic terms of their employment,
 
i.e.
 salaries, emoluments, incentives and other benefits, with 
their employers since these matters are covered by compensation and 
position standards issued by the Department of Budget and Management and
 applicable laws. 
GSIS
 clarified that RA 10149 applies to both chartered and non-chartered GOCCs.



More, citing 
PCSO vs. Pulido-Tan
,
[46]
 
GSIS

 reiterated that the power of a government-owned or controlled 
corporation to fix salaries or allowances of its employees is subject to
 and must conform to the compensation and classification standards laid 
down by applicable laws. For RA l 0149 does not differentiate between 
chartered and non-chartered government-owned or controlled corporations;
 hence, the provisions of this law equally apply to 
all GOCCs
.



Consequently, therefore, PNCC did not violate the non-diminution rule 
when it desisted from granting mid-year bonus to its employees starting
2013. True, between 1992 and 2011, PNCC invariably granted this benefit 
to its employees and never before revoked this grant in strict adherence
 to the non-diminution rule under Article 100 of the Labor Code. 
Nonetheless, with the subsequent enactment of RA 10149 in 2011, PNCC may
 no longer grant this benefit without first securing the requisite 
authority from the President. As borne by the records, PNCC failed to 
obtain this authority in view of the position taken by the GCG not to 
forward the request to the President. GCG cited as reasons the infirmity
 of the grant and the extraneous application of the non-diminution rule 
thereto.





All told, the labor arbiter, the NLRC, and the Court of Appeals each 
gravely erred when they peremptorily compelled PNCC to release the 
questioned mid-year bonus to the employees.




ACCORDINGLY
, the petition for review is 
GRANTED
. The Decision dated July 12, 2018 and Resolution dated July 15, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 139311 are 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
. The complaint in NLRC NCR Case No. 07-10180-13 is 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit.

 Section 3. x x x


x x x x


(o) 
Government-Owned or -Controlled Corporation (GOCC)
 refers to 
any agency organized as a stock or nonstock corporation, vested with
