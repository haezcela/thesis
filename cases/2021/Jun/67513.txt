GAERLAN, J.:


The Case
 
This petition for 
certiorari
[1]

 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assails the following issuances of 
the Office of the Ombudsman in Case No. OMB-C-C-09-0465-I: 1) February 
9, 2011 Resolution dismissing the complaint filed by the Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas (BSP) against private respondent Benjamin M. Jamorabo 
(Jamorabo) for lack of probable cause;
[2]
 and 2) July 28, 2011 Order denying the motion for reconsideration filed by the BSP.
[3]


The Facts


Petitioner BSP is the constitutionally mandated
[4]
 central monetary authority of the Philippines, created through Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653.
[5]
Jamorabo
 was a former Bank Officer I in the BSP's Supervision and Examination 
Sector (SES). As earlier mentioned, BSP filed a complaint dated August 
11, 2009,
[6]
 against Jamorabo 
before the Office of the Ombudsman for violation of Section 27(d) of 
R.A. No. 7653 and BSP Office Order No. 423, series of 2002, for 
obtaining a loan with the Rural Bank of Kiamba, Sarangani, Inc. (RBKSI) 
while he was conducting the regular examination of said bank from July 6
 to 22, 2006. The complaint alleged the following:


3. The investigation of the OSI revealed that, during the 
RBKSI examination, specifically on 17 July 2006, Mr. Jamorabo took out 
an unsecured loan in the amount of P200,000 with RBKSI. He promised 
RBKSI's president Cornelio T. Falgui [Falgui], and manager, William C. 
Nero [Nero] (Affidavit, attached as Annex _____ together with all the 
supporting documents), that he would settle the loan prior to the next 
BSP general examination of RBKSI, which is conducted every two-year 
interval, so that the loan would no longer be in RBKSFs books. According
 to Mr. Nero, Mr. Falgui had wanted to turn down the application, but 
could not do so because he feared he might offend Mr. Jamorabo.

4. For a loan of such amount, RBKSI would normally require from the 
borrower a collateral, presentation of documentary proof of income, and 
credit investigation. Mr. Jamorabo's loan, however, did not undergo the 
ordinary processes and was approved without him offering a collateral. 
He convinced Mr. Nero that he would just issue post-dated checks payable
 to RBKSI.

5. Mr. Jamorabo issued a total of eight personal post-dated checks, six 
in the amount of P30,000 and two in blank, drawable against his checking
 account maintained at the Philippine National Bank ("PNB")-Central Bank
 ("CB") Service Unit-Manila, representing eight payments for his 
quarterly amortizations of P30,000. The first amortization was due 17 
October 2006.

6. It must be emphasized that in the loan documents, Mr. Jamorabo did 
not indicate his name as the principal borrower but the name of his 
wife, Marites B. Jamorabo (Marites). He made himself as her co-maker. 
He, however, was the one who filled out and signed the loan documents, 
including signing in the name of his wife. Ms. Marites B. Jamorabo 
neither went to the bank nor signed any loan documents.

7. On 18 July 2006, Mr. Nero deposited, through inter-bank transaction 
at PNB-Santiago Boulevard Branch, General Santos City, the net proceeds 
of the loan in the amount of P198,000 into the savings account of Mr. 
Jamorabo maintained at PNB-CB Service Unit-Manila.

8. When the loan became due, he was able to pay only the first and 
second amortizations and only after his first check had already 
"bounced" for the reason that it was drawn against insufficient funds 
("DAIF"). His first and second amortizations were due on 17 October 2006
 and 17 January 2007, respectively, but he remitted his loan payment 
only on 9 February 2007 to RBKSI's depositary bank ("Equitable-PCI 
Bank") via inter-bank deposit at Equitable-PCI Bank in Bacoor, Cavite, 
and after requesting RBKSI not to deposit his second check.

9. When his third amortization became due, Mr. Jamorabo began calling 
RBKSI's cashier, Aurora Cagas, advising her not to deposit his check 
dated 17 April 2007 representing payment for his third amortization. His
 communication with the bank, however, suddenly stopped even after his 
check dated 17 July 2007 representing payment for his fourth 
amortization became due.

10. In September 2007, Mr. Nero decided to deposit in RBKSI's depositary
 bank Mr. Jamorabo's check dated 17 April 2007 representing payment for 
his third amortization. The check was dishonored for the reason that 
Jamorabo's checking account was already closed as of 17 September 2007. 
Mr. Nero sent a text message to Mr. Jamorabo urging him to pay his loan 
but Mr. Nero did not receive any reply. Mr. Nero also tried calling Mr. 
Jamorabo's cellular phone but the same could no longer be contacted. 
Considering that Mr. Jamorabo's checking account was already closed, Mr.
 Nero decided not to deposit the rest of Mr. Jamorabo's checks. Mr. 
Falgui thought of suing Mr. Jamorabo, but he died in July 2008 without a
 case having been filed.

11. Sometime in December 2008, Mr. Nero received a cell phone call from 
Mr. Jamorabo using a different number. Mr. Jamorabo informed the manager
 that he would settle his loan account with RBKSI and instructed the 
Manager to text to him the outstanding balance of his loan. Mr. Jamorabo
 also reasoned out that he failed to make good his checks because he was
 sent for further studies by the BSP to Malaysia.

12. Despite the promise, Mr. Jamorabo did not pay his loan.

13. On 14 to 29 April 2009, the Anti-Money Laundering Specialist Group, 
SES, conducted a regular examination of RBKSI. Taking this as an 
opportunity, Mr. Nero divulged Mr. Jamorabo's loan to the 
examiner-in-charge. The examiner-in-charge informed the manager that Mr.
 Jamorabo had just retired from the BSP and advised the manager to write
 a letter to Mr. Willie Asto, Managing Director of Financial Accounting 
Department of the BSP, requesting assistance in deducting from Mr. 
Jamorabo's retirement benefits the outstanding balance of his loan 
amounting to P210,829.49 as of 23 April 2009.

14. The loan is undeniably Mr. Jamorabo's loan even if he deceptively 
misrepresented that the principal borrower was his wife. As positively 
disclosed by Mr. Nero, there was no Ms. Marites Jamorabo who appeared in
 the bank and signed the loan documents. Be that as it may,  having 
signed as a co-maker, in the eyes of the law, he is also considered a 
principal borrower being jointly and severally liable for payment of the
 loan.

15. Thus, when he took out the loan on 17 July 2006, during which period
 the RBKSI was under his examination, he clearly committed a violation 
of Section 27(d) of R.A. No. 7653. x x x
[7]


The complaint was docketed as a criminal case
[8]

 and preliminary investigation was conducted thereon. On November 17, 
2009, the Ombudsman ordered Jamorabo to submit his counter-affidavit.
[9]

 On December 10, 2009, Jamorabo complied with the anti-graft agency's 
order by submitting his own affidavit together with the affidavits of 
his witnesses, his wife Marites, and his sister-in-law, Honeyve 
Montecalvo.
[10]


In dismissing the complaint, the Ombudsman ruled that a violation of 
R.A. No. 7653, Section 27(d) and BSP Office Order No. 423, series of 
2002 does not entail criminal liability; hence Jamorabo can only be held
 administratively liable. However, since Jamorabo had already retired 
from government service on December 31, 2008,
[11]
 before the complaint was filed, he cannot be sanctioned anymore.
[12]

 The anti-graft agency also ruled that Jamorabo cannot be held liable 
for violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 because the BSP failed to 
prove any injury, loss or damage to the government caused by Jamorabo's 
acts, since he was able to pay the loan in full.
[13]

 Finally, the Ombudsman held that the officers of RBKSI were also at 
fault for approving Jamorabo's loan application. Given the high 
standards of diligence expected from banks, RBKSI's officers should have
 exercised extreme caution in processing Jamorabo's loan application. 
Furthermore, they reported the incident only in 2009; almost three years
 after Jamorabo availed of the loan.
[14]
 

The BSP sought reconsideration
[15]

 but the Ombudsman rendered the assailed July 28, 2011 order affirming 
the dismissal of the complaint. The Ombudsman maintained that Jamorabo 
can no longer be administratively sanctioned because the case against 
him was filed 
after
 he had retired from government service and that full payment of the loan in question negated the existence of undue injury. 
On April 3, 2012, the BSP filed the present petition for 
certiorari
.
[16]
 On June 18, 2012, this Court ordered respondents to file their respective comments on the petition;
[17]
 however, only the Office of Ombudsman complied.
[18]

 During the pendency of the case, it was discovered that Jamorabo had 
migrated to Canada with his family on April 14, 2010, with no intention 
of returning to the Philippines;
[19]
 hence, the Court dispensed with his comment.
[20]

 On April 24, 2013, the BSP filed its reply. The issues having been 
joined, the Court now resolves the following questions posed by the 
pleadings: 

1) What liabilities arise from a violation of R.A. No. 7653, Section 
27(d)? 

2) Can Jamorabo still be held administratively liable even if the 
present complaint was filed after his retirement from government 
service? 

3) Is there a 
prima facie
 case for Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 against Jamorabo? 
The Court's Ruling


The petition is partially meritorious. While this Court respects the 
wide latitude given to the Office of the Ombudsman in the exercise of 
its investigatory and prosecutorial powers,
[21]

 it is likewise this Court's power and duty to set aside the rulings of 
the Ombudsman if such rulings are tainted with grave abuse of 
discretion.
[22]


Violation of R.A. No. 7653, Section 
27(d) gives rise to both administrative

and criminal liability.
 

Section 27(d) of R.A. No. 7653 is composed of two parts: a general rule 
and a proviso. The first part of the provision states the general rule: 
BSP personnel are not allowed to 
"[borrow] from any institution 
subject to supervision or examination by the Bangko Sentral x x x unless
 said borrowings are adequately secured, fully disclosed to the Monetary
 Board, and x x x subject[ed] to such further rules and regulations as 
the Monetary Board may prescribe."
 The second part, or the proviso, further qualifies this rule with a second, more specific prohibition: 
"That
 personnel of the supervising and examining departments are prohibited 
from borrowing from a bank under their supervision or examination."

 This qualification to the general rule is specifically targeted at the 
BSP personnel who do the actual work of supervising and examining banks,
 and who are absolutely prohibited from borrowing from banks under their
 supervision or examination. 

The absolute and unqualified ban on borrowings by the BSP's supervision 
and examination personnel was removed by R.A. No. 11211,
[23]
 which amended Section 27(d) as follows:


SEC. 27. 
Prohibitions
. â In addition to the 
prohibitions found in Republic Act Nos. 3019 and 6713, personnel of the 
Bangko Sentral are hereby prohibited from:
 x x x x

(d) borrowing from any institution subject to supervision or examination
 by the Bangko Sentral unless said borrowing is transacted on an arm's 
length basis, fully disclosed to the Monetary Board, and shall be 
subject to such rules and regulations as the Monetary Board may 
prescribe.


Nevertheless, the provision, as amended, maintains the general rule in 
R.A. No. 7653: BSP personnel cannot borrow loans from entities that are 
subject to the BSP's supervision or examination, unless the conditions 
set forth in the provision are met.

To penalize violations thereof, R.A. No. 7653 contains a general penal 
clause, which is essentially retained in R.A. No. 11211, 
viz
.: 
 
 
 Original text
 
 As amended
 
 
 

 Section 36. Proceedings Upon Violation of This Act and Other Banking 
Laws, Rules, Regulations, Orders or Instructions. â Whenever a bank or 
quasi-bank, or 
whenever any person or entity willfully violates 
this Act

 or other pertinent banking laws being enforced or implemented by the 
Bangko Sentral or any order, instruction, rule or regulation issued by 
the Monetary Board, 
the person or persons responsible for such violation shall unless otherwise provided in this Act be punished

 by a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) nor more 
than Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00) or by imprisonment of not 
less than two (2) years nor more than ten (10) years, or both, at the 
discretion of the court.
 

 SEC. 36. Proceedings upon Violation of This Act and Other Banking Laws,
 Rules, Regulations, Orders or Instructions. â Whenever a bank, 
quasi-bank, including their subsidiaries and affiliates engaged in 
allied activities or other entity which under this Act or special laws 
is subject to Bangko Sentral supervision or 
whenever anv person or entity willfully violates this Act

 or other pertinent banking laws being enforced or implemented by the 
Bangko Sentral or any order, instruction, rule or regulation issued by 
the Monetary Board, 
the person or persons responsible for such violation shall unless otherwise provided in this Act be punished

 by a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) nor more 
than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) or by imprisonment of not less 
than two (2) years nor more than ten (10) years, or both, at the 
discretion of the court.
 


Read together, Sections 27(d) and 36 categorically provide that BSP 
personnel who borrow from institutions under BSP supervision or 
examination without complying with the requisite former provision shall 
be penalized by a fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of 
the court. Thus, the Ombudsman committed a glaring mistake amounting to 
grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that a violation of R.A. No. 
7653, Section 27(d) entails administrative liability only. A cursory 
reading of the statute 
in its entirety
 clearly shows that Section 27(d) is a penal provision, a violation of which gives rise to criminal liability,
[24]
 apart from the administrative liability imposed by BSP Office Orders No. 423,
[25]
 series of 2002; and No. 860, series of 2007;
[26]
 and the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
[27]

 Settled is the rule that wrongful acts or omissions of public officers 
may give rise to civil, criminal, and administrative liability, each of 
which is separate and distinct from the other.
[28]


In the case at bar, there is no dispute that: 1) Jamorabo was one of the
 BSP personnel assigned to conduct the examination of RBKSI from July 5 
to 22, 2006; and 2) Jamorabo, as co-maker
[29]
 for his wife, took out a 200,000-peso loan from RBKSI during the examination period thereof.
[30]

 However, in view of our finding that Section 27(d) is a penal 
provision, the repeal by R.A. No. 11211 of the absolute prohibition on 
borrowings by BSP supervision and examination personnel should be given 
retroactive effect in favor of Jamorabo, pursuant to Article 22 of the 
Revised Penal Code.
[31]
 Consequently, Jamorabo's loan with RBKSI can no longer be considered a 
per se
 violation of Section 27(d); rather, its compliance with the requisites of Section 27(d), as amended, must be ascertained. 


Jamorabo's loan does not meet the 
requisites of Section 27(d), as
amended.


As earlier mentioned, to be permissible under Section 27(d), loans taken
 out by BSP personnel with institutions undergoing BSP examination must 
now satisfy three requisites: 1) conduct of the transaction on arm's 
length basis; 2) full disclosure to the Monetary Board; and 3) 
compliance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Monetary Board. 
Jamorabo's transaction with RBKSI does not meet any of these requisites. 
An arm's-length transaction is defined as follows: 
"one between two 
parties, however closely related they may be, conducted as if the 
parties were strangers, so that no conflict of interest arises;"
[32]
 one made 
"in
 good faith in the ordinary course of business by parties with 
independent interests.... The standard under which unrelated parties, 
each acting in his or her own best interest, would carry out a 
particular transaction;"
[33]
 or 
"dealings
 between two parties who are not related or not on close terms and who 
are presumed to have roughly equal bargaining power; not involving a 
confidential relationship."
[34]
 The principle is closely related to the concept of undue influence, 
viz
.:


The notion of dealings at arm's length featured in the 
somewhat related doctrine of "undue influence" that was developed in the
 courts of equity. A description of this doctrine is given by Lord 
Penzance in Parfitt v. Lawless where he says:


In equity persons standing in certain relations to one 
another-such as parent and child, man and wife, doctor and patient, 
attorney and client, confessor and penitent, guardian and ward-are 
subject to certain presumptions when transactions between them are 
brought in question; and if a gift or contract made in favour of him who
 holds the position of influence is impeached by him who is subject to 
that influence, the Courts of equity cast upon the former the burthen of
 proving that the transaction was fairly conducted as if between 
strangers.


The courts of equity have refused to limit the relationships from which 
the presumption of abuse of position or confidence might arise. The 
doctrine of undue influence in equity also applies to situations 
involving strangers outside any special relationship. For instance, 
where a mortgagor of property has conveyed to a mortgagee and is infirm 
and illiterate and has no independent legal advice "the onus of 
justifying the transaction, and shewing that it was a right and fair 
transaction, is thrown upon the mortgagee." The noteworthy point about 
the use of the phrase "not at arm's length" in equity was that it 
referred to a straight tug-of-war between one subject and another and 
was not a three-way affair between two subjects and the state itself. 
The
 purpose of equitable intervention into these transactions was to 
prevent one subject from taking unfair advantage of another subject. 
Where transactions were tainted with the suggestion of undue influence 
the party on whom the onus was cast might bring in adequate evidence to 
the contrary in order to support the transaction.
[35]


Clearly, the arm's length standard adopted in Section 27(d) means that 
BSP personnel must transact with BSP-examined institutions in such a way
 that they will not be able to utilize their position to gain undue 
influence with, or more favorable terms from, the target institution.
[36]
 In this case, there is 
prima facie

 evidence of Jamorabo's violation of the arm's-length standard in his 
dealing with RBKSI. RBKSI's general manager, Nero, positively identified
 Jamorabo as the prime mover behind the loan. Jamorabo approached Nero 
during RBKSI's examination period
 and told the latter that he wanted to 
"avail for himself"
 a loan of P200,000.00.
[37]

 Since the amount was beyond Nero's authority to approve, he accompanied
 Jamorabo to meet with RBKSI's president, Falgui, who wanted to deny the
 loan application but was afraid to do so, for fear of offending 
Jamorabo.
[38]
 Jamorabo 
personally filled out and signed the loan documents, but wrote in his 
wife's name as principal borrower. Jamorabo's wife, the supposed 
principal borrower, never went to RBKSI to personally process her 
supposed application.
[39]
 Nero
 suggested that Jamorabo designate one of his co-examiners as a 
co-maker, but Jamorabo flatly stated that his colleagues will not agree 
to do so.
[40]
 Jamorabo admits that he took out the loan 
during RBKSI's examination period

 but claims that his team had already finished the examination when he 
approached Nero to inquire about availing a loan with RBKSI.
[41]

 Furthermore, the loan did not undergo the bank's standard credit 
investigation and security procedure, for it was not backed by real 
security;
[42]
 and was hastily 
approved. Per Jamorabo's narration, he approached Nero about taking out a
 loan with RBKSI after the actual examination of RBKSI had ended on July
 16, 2006,
[43]
and the loan was approved the next day, on July 17, 2006.
[44]

 Taken together, the timing and the circumstances surrounding the loan 
transaction indicate that Jamorabo's position as examiner-in-charge of 
RBKSI unduly influenced the speedy facilitation thereof, in violation of
 the arm's-length principle. 

Furthermore, Jamorabo did not disclose the loan to the BSP, in violation
 of the express provision of Section 27(d) and BSP regulations. As 
stated in the BSP's complaint, it discovered the loan only in April 
2009, during the succeeding periodic examination of RBKSI, after Nero 
divulged the loan to the examiner-in-charge
[45]

 and to the Managing Director of the BSP's Financial Accounting 
Department, and after the spouses Jamorabo defaulted on the loan 
[46]

 Tellingly, Jamorabo's affidavit is completely silent on whether he 
disclosed the loan to the BSP. His complete silence on the matter 
betrays his awareness of the illegality of the transaction he entered 
into with RBKSI. Had he disclosed the loan in any manner to his 
superiors, he could have very easily said so in his affidavit; but he 
did not, since he knew full well that the transaction was absolutely 
prohibited under the then-prevailing law. The foregoing facts clearly 
make out a prima facie case for violation of Section 27(d) in relation 
to Section 36 of R.A. No. 7653 against Jamorabo; and the Ombudsman 
committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling that Jamorabo cannot be 
held criminally liable therefor.


Jamorabo can still be held 
administratively liable even if the

charge against him was filed after
 his
retirement.


The BSP argues that Jamorabo can still be held administratively liable 
for his loan transaction with RBKSI even if the complaint was filed 
before the Ombudsman almost eight months after Jamorabo's retirement 
from government service. It cites the cases of 
Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr.
 
[47]
 
(Pagano)
, 
Baquerfo v. Sanchez
[48]
 
(Baquerfo)
, and 
Office of the Ombudsman v. Andutan
[49]
 
(Andutan)

 in support of the proposition that "the crux of administrative 
liability is not only the incumbency of a government official but also 
that: first, the act complained of must have been done during one's 
stint in the government; and second, administrative sanctions, other 
than dismissal, may still be meted out despite separation from service."
[50]


The BSP's contentions have been passed upon and expressly rejected in one of the very cases it cited in support thereof. In 
Andutan
 the Court held:


To recall, we have held in the past that a public official's
 resignation does not render moot an administrative case that was filed 
prior to the official's resignation. In 
Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr.
, we held that:


In 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Juan
 x x x, 
this Court categorically ruled that the precipitate resignation of a 
government employee charged with an offense punishable by dismissal from
 the service does not render moot the administrative case against him. 
Resignation is not a way out to evade administrative liability when 
facing administrative sanction. The resignation of a public servant does
 not preclude the finding of any administrative liability to which he or
 she shall still be answerable x x x.


Likewise, in Baquerfo v. Sanchez, we held:


Cessation from office of respondent by resignation x x x or 
retirement x x x neither warrants the dismissal of the administrative 
complaint filed against him while he was still in the service x x x nor 
does it render said administrative case moot and academic x x x. The 
jurisdiction that was this Court's at the time of the filing of the 
administrative complaint was not lost by the mere fact that the 
respondent public official had ceased in office during the pendency of 
his case x x x. Respondent's resignation does not preclude the finding 
of any administrative liability to which he shall still be answerable x x
 x.


However, the facts of those cases are not entirely applicable to the present case. In the above-cited cases, 
the
 Court found that the public officials - subject of the administrative 
cases - resigned, either to prevent the continuation of a case already 
filed or to pre-empt the imminent filing of one. Here, neither situation
 obtains.


The Ombudsman's general assertion that Andutan pre-empted the filing of a
 case against him by resigning, since he "knew for certain that the 
investigative and disciplinary arms of the State would eventually reach 
him" is unfounded. First, Andutan's resignation was neither his choice 
nor of his own doing; he was forced to resign. Second, Andutan resigned 
from his DOF post on July 1, 1998, while the administrative case was 
filed on September 1, 1999, exactly one (1) year and two (2) months 
after his resignation. The Court struggles to find reason in the 
Ombudsman's sweeping assertions in light of these facts.


What is clear from the records is that Andutan was forced to resign more
 than a year before the Ombudsman filed the administrative case against 
him. Additionally, even if we were to accept the Ombudsman's position 
that Andutan foresaw the filing of the case against him, his forced 
resignation negates the claim that he tried to prevent the filing of the
 administrative case.


Having established the inapplicability of prevailing jurisprudence, we 
turn our attention to the provisions of Section VI of CSC Memorandum 
Circular No. 38. 
We disagree with the Ombudsman's interpretation 
that "[a]s long as the breach of conduct was committed while the public 
official or employee was still in the service x x x a public servant's 
resignation is not a bar to his administrative investigation, 
prosecution and adjudication." If we agree with this interpretation, any
 official - even if he has been separated from the service for a long 
time - may still be subject to the disciplinary authority of his 
superiors, ad infinitum.
 
We believe that this interpretation 
is inconsistent with the principal motivation of the law - which is to 
improve public service and to preserve the public's faith and confidence
 in the government, and not the punishment of the public official 
concerned. Likewise, if the act committed by the public official is 
indeed inimical to the interests of the State, other legal mechanisms 
are available to redress the same.


The possibility of imposing
 accessory penalties does no
t
negate the Ombudsman's
 lack of jurisdiction.


The Ombudsman suggests that although the issue of Andutan's removal from
 the service is moot, there is an "irresistible justification" to 
"determine whether or not there remains penalties capable of imposition,
 like bar from re-entering the public service and forfeiture of 
benefits." Otherwise stated, since accessory penalties may still be 
imposed against Andutan, the administrative case itself is not moot and 
may proceed despite the inapplicability of the principal penalty of 
removal from office.


We find several reasons that militate against this position.

First, 
although we have held that the resignation of an official 
does not render an administrative case moot and academic because 
accessory penalties may still be imposed, this holding must be read in 
its proper context.
 In 
Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr.
, indeed, we held:


A case becomes moot and academic only when there is no more 
actual controversy between the parties or no useful purpose can be 
served in passing upon the merits of the case x x x. The instant case is
 not moot and academic, despite the petitioner's separation from 
government service. Even if the most severe of administrative sanctions -
 that of separation from service - may no longer be imposed on the 
petitioner, there are other penalties which may be imposed on her if she
 is later found guilty of administrative offenses charged against her, 
namely, the disqualification to hold any government office and the 
forfeiture of benefits. x x x


Reading the quoted passage in a vacuum, one could be led to the 
conclusion that the mere availability of accessory penalties justifies 
the continuation of an administrative case. This is a misplaced reading 
of the case and its ruling.

Esther S. Pagano - who was serving as Cashier IV at the Office of the 
Provincial Treasurer of Benguet - filed her certificate of candidacy for
 councilor four days after the Provincial Treasurer directed her to 
explain why no administrative case should be filed against her. The 
directive arose from allegations that her accountabilities included a 
cash shortage of P1,424,289.99. She filed her certificate of candidacy 
under the pretext that since she was deemed ipso facto resigned from 
office, she was no longer under the administrative jurisdiction of her 
superiors. Thus, according to Pagano, the administrative complaint had 
become moot.


We rejected Pagano's position on the principal ground "that the 
precipitate resignation of a government employee charged with an offense
 punishable by dismissal from the service does not render moot the 
administrative case against him. Resignation is not a way out to evade 
administrative liability when facing administrative sanction." 
Our
 position that accessory penalties are still imposable - thereby 
negating the mootness of the administrative complaint - merely flows 
from the fact that Pagano preÂ­empted the filing of the administrative 
case against her.
 It was neither intended to be a stand-alone 
argument nor would it have justified the continuation of the 
administrative complaint if Pagano's filing of candidacy/resignation did
 not reek of irregularities. Our factual findings in Pagano confirm 
this, viz.:


At the time petitioner filed her certificate of candidacy, 
petitioner was already notified by the Provincial Treasurer that she 
needed to explain why no administrative charge should be filed against 
her, after it discovered the cash shortage of P1,424,289.99 in her 
accountabilities. Moreover, she had already filed her answer. To all 
intents and purposes, the administrative proceedings had already been 
commenced at the time she was considered separated from service through 
her precipitate filing of her certificate of candidacy. Petitioner's bad
 faith was manifest when she filed it, fully knowing that administrative
 proceedings were being instituted against her as part of the procedural
 due process in laying the foundation for an administrative case. x x x


Plainly, 
our justification for the continuation of the 
administrative case - notwithstanding Pagano's resignation - was her 
"bad faith" in filing the certificate of candidacy, and 
not the availability of accessory penalties.
[51]


As clearly illustrated by the foregoing passage, 
Andutan
 upholds 
the general rule that the separation of a public officer from the 
government service forecloses the filing of administrative charges 
against such public officer.
[52]

 The continuing validity and binding effect of administrative 
proceedings after the resignation or voluntary separation of the 
respondent public officer is based not on the availability of accessory 
penalties but on the bad faith attendant to such resignation or 
voluntary separation. Contrary to the BSP's assertion, 
Pagano
 and 
Baquerfo
 do not depart from these principles. In 
Pagano
 and 
Baquerfo

 the administrative charges were filed before the erring public officers
 resigned, and this Court held that their resignation did not serve as a
 bar to the continuation of administrative proceedings against them, 
since the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal had already 
attached even 
before
 the respondents were separated from the service.
[53]
 In 
Andutan
, the administrative case against Andutan was filed more than one year 
after
 his separation from the service; hence, the Court ruled that he can no longer be administratively charged.


However, the holding in 
Andutan
 is premised on the finding that 
Andutan was involuntarily separated from the service by virtue of a 
directive from the Executive Secretary.
[54]
 Based on the aforequoted passage in 
Andutan
,
 separation from the service is not an absolute bar to the filing of an 
administrative charge if the public officer voluntarily separated from 
the service to "pre-empt the imminent filing" thereof.
[55]
 That is precisely what happened in Office of the 
Court Administrator v. Juan
,
[56]

 where the public officer tendered his resignation a day after 
confessing to the commission of an administrative offense. The 
administrative proceedings were formally initiated two months after he 
tendered his resignation, which this Court did not accept, 
viz
.:


The CZ Pistol was discovered missing during the hearing on 7
 May 2003 in the criminal case for Parricide when the defense counsel 
requested the production of the CZ Pistol. It was only on 19 May 2003 
that respondent confessed that he took the CZ Pistol with its magazine 
and cartridges. During the investigation on the missing CZ Pistol, 
respondent failed to appear despite notices sent to him. Respondent's 
refusal to appear before the investigating judge, and his precipitate 
resignation from the service, are clear indicia of guilt. Respondent's 
act of taking the CZ Pistol constitutes dishonesty and grave misconduct.

Under Section 22, Rule IV of the Civil Service Rules, dishonesty and 
grave misconduct are grave offenses punishable by dismissal from the 
service even if it is the first offense. 
Respondents resignation 
does not render the case moot. Resignation is not a way out to evade 
administrative liability when a court personnel is facing administrative
 sanction.
[57]


In the present case, it is undisputed that Jamorabo voluntarily retired from government service effective December 31, 2008,
[58]
 or a mere four (4) months before RBKSI's next regular examination on April 2009.
[59]

 Having failed to fulfill his personal promise to RBKSI president Falgui
 that the loan would be settled prior to the next regular examination of
 RBKSI, Jamorabo suddenly separated himself from government service 
before the said examination. Having been a bank examiner for 21 years,
[60]

 it is reasonable to presume that Jamorabo knew of RBKSI's upcoming 
regular examination, and that he was wise to the possibility of RBKSI 
reporting the still unpaid loan to the BSP in the course thereof. This 
is bolstered by the report of the BSP's Investigation and Intelligence 
Division finding that Jamorabo had started applying for a Canadian 
Permanent Resident Visa as early as June 2008.
[61]
Given the suspicious timing and the circumstances surrounding his 
voluntary
 retirement from the service, coupled with his actual departure from the Philippines in April 2010,
[62]
 barely four months after the loan was finally settled by his wife and sister-in-law,
[63]

 this Court finds that Jamorabo's voluntary separation from government 
service was calculated to pre-empt the charges that will inevitably 
result from the discovery of the illicit loan he entered into. As it 
turned out, RBKSI did report the loan to the BSP in the very next 
examination period; and the complaint against Jamorabo was filed shortly
 thereafter. All told, the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion
 in ruling that Jamorabo could no longer be held administratively 
liable. Likewise, the Ombudsman also committed grave abuse of discretion
 when it docketed Jamorabo's case as a purely criminal investigation, 
without pursuing the administrative aspect thereof. The Ombudsman must 
therefore proceed with the determination of Jamorabo's administrative 
liability for violation of the Central Bank Act and other pertinent 
government regulations in connection with the loan he contracted with 
RBKSI.


There is no prima facie case for

violation of R.A. No. 3019, Section
3(e) 
against Jamorabo.
 
Section 3 of R.A. No. 3019 enumerates and defines the corrupt practices 
of public officers which are outlawed and penalized by said law. 
Paragraph (e) of said provision embraces two different acts: "causing 
any undue injury to any party", and "giving any private party any 
unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his 
official administrative or judicial functions through manifest 
partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence." 
Jurisprudence treats these two different acts as two different modes of 
committing the same offense; therefore, an accused violates Section 3(e)
 by committing either one or both of the said acts.
[64]


In the case at bar, the Ombudsman correctly found that Jamorabo could 
not be held liable for violating Section 3(e) through the first mode 
because the loan had been paid in full. Well settled is the rule that in
 a prosecution for violation of Section 3(e) through causing undue 
injury, proof of actual injury or damage must be shown.
[65]
 Contrary to the BSP's position,
[66]
 
"undue injury in Sec. 3(e) cannot be presumed even after a wrong or a violation of a right has been established ,"
[67]

 While Jamorabo's loan is indeed a violation of R.A. No. 7653, the BSP 
was unable to show how such violation caused actual damage or injury to 
any party, much less to RBKSI.


The BSP argues that Jamorabo should still be charged with violating 
Section 3(e) through the second mode. It argues that Jamorabo's loan 
arrangement with RBKSI conferred the latter with the unwarranted benefit
 of escaping BSP detection and sanction for the unauthorized loan, 
specifically by deliberately designating his wife as the principal 
borrower and scheduling the loan payments before the next scheduled 
regular examination of RBKSI.
[68]
 On this point, We approvingly cite the Ombudsman's findings:


As for the alleged giving of unwarranted benefits to the 
bank, this Office finds the same unmeritorious. There was no showing of 
any concrete benefit given to the Rural Bank of Kiamba, Inc. at the time
 respondent's loan was granted. The bank officers' silence or inaction 
over the matter resulting in the non-discovery of the loan, cannot be 
considered an unwarranted benefit but rather an irregular act or lapse 
of judgment on their part.
[69]


It bears repeating that both Nero and Falgui â who were the general 
manager and the president of RBKSI, respectively â objected to 
Jamorabo's loan application.
[70]
 As alleged in Nero's affidavit, Falgui only approved the loan out of fear of offending Jamorabo.
[71]

 Furthermore, RBKSI did not really gain the benefit of escaping 
detection since it reported the loan to the BSP in the course of its 
next regular examination.
