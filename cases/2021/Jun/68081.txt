THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. Nos. 251306-07, June 16, 2021 ]


COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. NORKIS TRADING COMPANY, INC., RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




INTING, J.:


 This resolves the Petition for 
Certiorari
[1]
 filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assailing the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) 
En Banc
 Resolutions dated May 29, 2019
[2]
 and January 16, 2020
[3]
 which dismissed the CIR's petitions for review docketed as CTA 
En Banc
 Nos. 1766 and 1845,
[4]
 respectively.
The Antecedents
The present case stemmed from an assessment
[5]
 issued by the CIR against Norkis Trading Company, Inc. (Norkis) involving alleged deficiency income taxes amounting to P285,927,070.68, inclusive of interest and penalties, for the taxable year ending June 30, 2007.
[6]
Norkis filed a judicial protest before the CTA which was docketed as CTA Case No. 8862.
Ruling of the CTA Division
On August 16, 2017, the CTA Second Division (CTA Division) rendered a Decision (Main Decision)
[7]
 canceling the aforementioned assessment for two reasons. 
First
, the CIR failed to prove that Norkis entered into an Indemnity Agreement with, or that it received an indemnity fee from Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd. (Yamaha) amounting to $6 Million.
[8]
 Consequently, it failed to establish a substantial underÂ­declaration of gross sales on the part of Norkis which would have allowed the application of the 10-year prescriptive period in issuing an assessment. 
Second
, the tax authorities only had three years to assess Norkis, or until October 14, 2010. However, Norkis received the assessment only on April 11, 2014. Therefore, the assessment is void for having been issued beyond the three-year prescriptive period.
[9]
Aggrieved, the CIR filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[10]
 dated August 31, 2017, insisting that it sufficiently established the fact of Norkis' underdeclaration of sales, and thus, the 10-year prescriptive period applies to the assessment.
[11]
Subsequently, the CIR also filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration
[12]
 dated October 2, 2017 requesting the CTA Division to consider and admit copies of the following documents: (a) agreement between Norkis and Yamaha and (b) letter from the National Tax Agency of Japan. According to the CIR, the documents are 
prima facie
 evidence of an Indemnity Agreement between the parties
[13]
 from which Norkis received, but did not declare a fee as part of their gross sales. Alternatively, the CIR sought to reopen the proceedings for purposes of identifying the aforementioned documents, if necessary.
[14]
However, in a Resolution dated December 12, 2017, the CTA Division denied both motions for lack of merit.
[15]
Undaunted, the CIR filed another Motion for Reconsideration
[16]
 dated January 19, 2018 of the Resolution dated December 12, 2017, specifically the denial of its request to admit additional documents and the alternative prayer to reopen the proceedings.
Pending the CTA Division's resolution on the most recent motion, the CIR filed a Petition for Review 
Ad Cautelam
,
[17]
 dated February 7, 2018 before the CTA 
En Banc
 docketed as CTA EB No. 1766 assailing the Main Decision and the Resolution dated December 12, 2017, 
viz.
:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed of the Honorable Court that the 
assailed Decision promulgated on 16 August 2017 and Resolution dated 12 December 2017
 denying petitioner's Molon for Reconsideration be REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and judgment be rendered ordering the respondent to pay the deficiency income taxes in the amount to P285,927,070.68, inclusive of interest and penalties, for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, as well as the corresponding penalty and deficiency and delinquency interest, pursuant to Sections 248 and 249 of the [National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)] of 1997.
Any other relief just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.
[18]
 (Underscoring supplied.)
Eventually, in a Resolution dated April 4, 2018, the CTA Division denied the CIR's Motion for Reconsideration filed on January 19, 2018 for being a second motion for reconsideration, and thus, prohibited under the rules.
[19]
The denial prompted the CIR to file another Petition for Review
[20]
 dated May 11, 2018 before the CTA 
En Banc
 docketed as CTA EB Case No. 1845 seeking to reverse the Main Decision and the Resolutions dated August 16, 2017 and April 4, 2018, 
viz.
:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed of the Honorable Court that the 
assailed Decision dated 16 August 2017, Resolution dated 12 December 2017
, and Resolution dated 4 April 2018 be REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and that judgment be rendered holding that the Agreement (between Yamaha and Norkis) and the Letter from the National Tax Agency of Japan are CONSIDERED and ADMITTED as evidence for petitioner, and/or that the Honorable Court REOPEN and REMAND the case to the Honorable CTA. Second Division to allow petitioner to present a witness who will identify the Agreement (between Yamaha and Norkis) and the Letter from the National Tax Agency of Japan.
Any other relief just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.
[21]
 (Underscoring supplied.)
Norkis filed its comment on the CIR's petition in CTA EB No. 1766 on April 27, 2018.
The court 
a quo
 later resolved
[22]
 to consolidate CTA EB Nos. 1766 and 1845 in view of the factual relation between the two proceedings.
[23]
Despite consolidation, Norkis sought the CTA 
En Banc
's permission to file a separate comment on the petition in CTA EB No. 1845.
Ruling of the CTA En Banc
In its assailed resolution, the CTA 
En Banc
 dismissed the CIR's petitions in CTA EB No. 1766 and 1845 on the ground of 
litis pendentia
. It explained that "x x x both petitions assail the [CTA] Division's Decision promulgated on August 16, 2017 and its Resolution promulgated on December 12, 2017."
[24]
 Inasmuch as the two cases involved the same parties, rights, reliefs, as well as factual foundation, "the resolution in one petition would amount to 
res judicata
 in the other."
[25]
 Thus, the CIR's simultaneous petitions amounted to forum shopping.
[26]
As a result, the CTA 
En Banc
 also denied Norkis's request because the petitions' dismissal would render the filing of a comment unnecessary.
[27]
The CIR moved to reconsider. However, the court 
a quo
 denied
[28]
 the motion.
Hence, the CIR filed the present petition.
Issue
The lone issue for the Court's resolution is whether the CTA 
En Banc
 erred in dismissing both petitions in CTA EB No. 1766 and 1845 for violating the rule against forum shopping.
The Court's Ruling
The petition is meritorious.
The Court agrees with the court 
a quo
 in that the CIR's petitions amounted to forum shopping. However, only the petition in CTA EB No. 1845 should have been dismissed, not both.  
 
The CIR is guilty of forum shopping.
 
When the CIR filed the petitions in CTA 
En Banc
 Nos. 1766 and 1845, it invoked the CTA 
En Banc
's 
exclusive appellate jurisdiction
 to review by appeal "[d]ecisions or resolutions on motions for reconsideration or new trial of the Court in Divisions in the exercise of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction over x x x [c]ases arising from the x x x Bureau of Internal Revenue."
[29]
A careful review of the subject petitions reveals that the CIR prayed for one and the same relief: that the CTA 
En Banc
 reverse and set aside the CTA Division's ruling consisting of its Main Decision and the subsequent resolutions denying the CIR's motion for reconsideration, as well as its supplement, which cancelled the subject assessment and disallowed the CIR to submit additional documents, or reopen trial. Stated differently, the CIR's main thrust in both appeals is that it be given the opportunity to reestablish the timeliness of its assessment.
To be sure, the petitions both stemmed from one assessment. That the focal point in petition in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1845 was the CIR's request to admit additional documents and/or reopen the proceedings, as it argues, did not create another matter that may be litigated independently of the assessment case.
Thus, the petitions have 
identical causes of action and subject matter
 inasmuch as both were appeals from the CTA Division's cancellation of the CIR's assessment against Norkis. Due to the two petitions' same identity in the 
parties, relief sought, cause of action
, and 
subject matter
, a favorable judgment in either CTA 
En Banc
 case would have remanded the proceedings to the CTA Division (
i.e.
, for the admission of documents or reopening of trial) and, effectively, resulted in 
res judicata
 in the other case.
The foregoing are the requisites of 
litis pendentia
.
[30]
 Thus, as correctly ruled by the court 
a quo
, the CIR's filing of the petition in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1845 despite the pendency of the proceedings in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1766 amounted to forum shopping.
[31]
Certainly, the CIR's two separate appeals before the CTA 
En Banc
 rendered the court 
a quo
 vulnerable to the possibility of rendering conflicting decisions upon the same issues-precisely the vexatious situation that the rule against forum shopping seeks to avoid.
[32]
  
 
Only the petition in CTA En Banc No. 1845 should have been dismissed.
 
The Court takes 
litis pendentia
 literally to mean "a pending suit." It may be invoked to dismiss
[33]
 
another pending action
 between the same parties involving the same cause of action because "the 
second action
 becomes unnecessary and vexatious."
[34]
 The dismissal of any one of the two pending actions would logically lead to the cessation of 
litis pendentia
. When the parties finally confine themselves to 
one suit
 in litigating similar issues between them, the former evil caused by a multiplicity of suits ceases to exist.
To reiterate, the CIR is guilty of forum shopping. However, the dismissal of 
both
 of its appeals is a harsh penalty. It may be prohibited to lodge multiple appeals, but the law certainly affords him an opportunity to seek redress from an unfavorable judgment. Thus, upon the dismissal of the petition in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1845, the CIR must still be allowed to pursue and maintain the petition in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1766.
WHEREFORE
, the Court 
GRANTS
 the instant petition and 
SETS ASIDE
 the Resolutions dated May 29, 2019 and January 16, 2020 of the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 in CTA 
En Banc
 Nos. 1766 and 1845. The Court 
DIRECTS
 the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 to reinstate the petition in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1766 and proceed with the case. On the other hand, the Court 
AFFIRMS
 the dismissal of the petition in CTA 
En Banc
 No. 1845.
