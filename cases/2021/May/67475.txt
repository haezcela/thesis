CARANDANG, J.:


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Rules) assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated April 26, 2013 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated August 14, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CAÂ­G.R. SP. No. 00014 filed by petitioner Cynthia A. Villar (Villar).


Antecedents



In 2009, respondent Alltech Contractors, Inc. (Alltech) submitted 
unsolicited proposals to respondent cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque 
for the development, financing, engineering, design, and reclamation of 
381.26 hectares of land in Las PiÃ±as and 174.88 hectares of land in 
ParaÃ±aque, which were both along the coast of Manila Bay.
[4]
 Consequently, the city councils of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque issued the corresponding resolutions
[5]

 authorizing their respective city mayors to explore the proposal under a
 Joint Venture Agreement (JVA), and to negotiate with the appropriate 
government agencies and other local government units.
[6]
 The cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque eventually accepted Alltech's proposal and the parties executed their respective JVAs.
[7]



Thereafter, respondent Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA), the 
agency authorized to approve reclamation projects in the country, 
approved the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project (proposed 
project) through Resolution No. 4088, Series of 2010
[8]
 and Resolution No. 4091, Series of 2010.
[9]
 The approval is subject to full compliance with existing laws, rules, and regulations in relation to the environment.
[10]



In March 2010, the PRA entered into separate Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with the cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque.
[11]

 On the other hand, Alltech, as directed by respondent Environmental 
Management Bureau (EMB), submitted an Environmental Performance Report 
Management Plan (EPRMP), for the proposed reclamation project to the 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
[12]





 

In October 2010, the Environmental Impact Assessment Review Committee 
(EIARC), composed of Agerico de Villa, Benjamin Francisco, and Renato 
Cruz of the DENR-EMB, met for a preliminary review of the EPRMP 
submitted. This meeting was also attended by Alltech representatives, 
consultants of Mediatrix Business Consultancy who were commissioned by 
Alltech to prepare its EPRMP, EMB case handlers, and resource persons 
from the PRA.
[13]



In December 2010, Alltech submitted its final EPRMP
[14]

 which now involved the reclamation of an estimated 203.43 hectares 
along the coast of Paranaque and 431.71 hectares along the coast of Las 
PiÃ±as. The proposed project area lies within the 750-hectare project 
site known as the Amari Coastal Bay Development Corporation (Amari) and 
covered by Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) No. 
CO-9602-002-208C which the Public Estates Authority (PEA; now PRA) 
initially issued in September 1996.
[15]



After reviewing the biophysical, social, and economic impact of the 
proposed project, the EIARC recommended the issuance of the ECC. On 
March 24, 2011, the EMB issued ECC No. CO-1101-0001
[16]
 stating the following conditions:


I. CONDITIONS

[17]



Fcaring that the proposed project will impede the flow of rivers of Las 
PiÃ±as-Zapote and ParaÃ±aque which may expose several adjacent 
barangays

 to flooding and endanger its residents, then Representative Villar, now
 Senator, conducted an information drive regarding the proposed project 
and gathered 315,849 signatures of Las PiÃ±as residents opposing the 
proposed project. On March 16, 2012, Villar, representing the 315,849 
Las PiÃ±as residents opposing the proposed project, filed a petition for 
the issuance of a writ of 
kalikasan
 before the Court. In asking 
the Court to enjoin the implementation of the proposed project, Villar 
invoked her constituents' right to a balanced and healthful ecology.



On April 24, 2012, the Court rendered a Resolution issuing the writ 
against respondents Alltech, PRA, DENR-EMB, and the cities of Las PiÃ±as,
 ParaÃ±aque, and Bacoor. On June 19, 2012, the Court remanded the case to
 the CA to accept the return of the writ, and to conduct the necessary 
hearing, reception of evidence, and rendition of judgment.
[18]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals



On April 26, 2013, the CA rendered its Decision,
[19]
 the dispositive portion of which states:


WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.


IT IS SO ORDERED.
[20]
 (Emphasis in the original)



In denying the petition for the issuance of a writ of 
kalikasan
, 
the CA declared that the totality of the evidence proved that the 
proposed reclamation project underwent the required EIA review process 
in compliance with the requirements of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 
1586
[21]
 and that the submission of the EPRMP was proper and lawful.
[22]

 The CA found the claim of Villar that Alltech did not undergo the 
proper EIA review inaccurate because it submitted its EPRMP, a 
recognized form of EIA study.
[23]

 The CA held that Alltech's submission of its EPRMP was proper as it 
belongs to the project category that requires such kind of EIA study. 
The CA added that it was the DENR-EMB which instructed the submission of
 an EPRMP.
[24]
 The CA pointed 
out that in requiring an EPRMP, Alltech was even required to meet a 
higher standard. This standard was to preserve the environmental 
condition in the vicinity of the proposed project using as basis the 
higher quality of environment in 1990.
[25]



The CA also ruled that a public consultation was conducted on November 
25, 2010 between representatives of Alltech, the cities of Las PiÃ±as and
 ParaÃ±aque, the PRA, the EIA consultant and other identified 
stakeholders in the direct and indirect impact areas of the proposed 
project.
[26]
 The CA also 
clarified that the nature of the proposed project does not require 
conducting a public hearing. It is mandatory only in projects falling 
under Category A-1 (new environmentally critical projects) pursuant to 
DENR Administrative Order (DAO) No. 2003-30.
[27]





The CA ruled that Villar, though motivated by good faith, failed to 
support her claim by any competent, credible, and reliable evidence that
 the proposed reclamation project will expose Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque 
residents to catastrophic environmental damage. For the CA, Tricore 
Solutions, Inc. (Tricore) and Center for Environmental 
Concerns-Philippines (CEC-P), the companies commissioned by Villar, 
failed to conduct a comprehensive and objective assessment of the 
proposed project and lacked the expertise necessary in the field of 
hydrology and hydraulics to competently conclude that the proposed 
project will cause environmental damage.
[28]



The CA did not give credence to Tricore's report wherein it was 
concluded that the proposed project would cause an increase in flood 
depth and inundate two-thirds of Las PiÃ±as, ParaÃ±aque, and Bacoor for 
lack of sufficient basis.
[29]
 
For the CA, the findings in Tricore's report were refuted by Alltech who
 was able to establish that measures were designed to mitigate the 
dreaded negative impacts of the proposed project.
[30]



The CA also did not give credence to CEC-P's study. The CA noted that 
CEC-P already had a conclusion in mind when it conducted its study at 
Villar's behest as it deliberately ignored the ECC and the studies 
conducted by DCCD Engineering Corp. (DCCD), Surbana International 
Consultants PTE Ltd. (Surbana), and DHI Water & Environment (S) Pte.
 Ltd. (DHI). The CA also noted that CEC-P relied on the EPRMP submitted 
in August 2010 and not the final EPRMP Alltech submitted in December 
2010, making its findings inaccurate and unreliable.
[31]





The CA also held that the precautionary principle, which shifts the 
burden of proof to the project proponent to prove that the threat to the
 environment does not exist, cannot be favorably applied to Villar's 
cause. The CA explained that the threat was not established and that the
 volumes of data generated by objective and expert analyses ruled out 
the scientific uncertainty of the nature and scope of the anticipated 
threat.
[32]
 Thus, the CA was not convinced that sufficient ground exists to grant the privilege of the writ of 
kalikasan
.
[33]





In a Resolution
[34]
 dated August 14, 2013, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration Villar filed.
[35]



In the present petition,
[36]
 
Villar argued that the issuance of an ECC for the proposed coastal bay 
project is illegal and unlawful because: (1) Alltech did not prepare the
 appropriate EIA study;
[37]
 (2) the meeting that was conducted supposedly as public consultation failed to satisfy the strict requirements of the law;
[38]
 (3) public hearings are mandatory for the proposed project;
[39]
 (4) a detailed statement of project alternative to the proposed reclamation project is a requirement under the law;
[40]

 and (5) questions relating to financial and technical capabilities of a
 proponent are relevant and material to the issue relating to its 
ability to implement the proposed project.
[41]



Villar insists that the proposed project impinges on the viability and 
sustainability of the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and 
Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA).
[42]

 Villar also maintains that the proposed project will cause 
environmental damage so as to prejudice the life, health or property of 
Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque residents because: (1) it will aggravate 
flooding;
[43]
 (2) the 
mitigation measures will impede the ecological functions of the LPPCHEA 
as these will require giving up 4.35 hectares of the LPPCHEA;
[44]
 and (3) the claim that reclamation 
per se
 may be pursued for its supposed positive impact and restorative qualities lacks basis.
[45]



In their Comment,
[46]
 Alltech 
countered that the proposed project underwent the required EIA process 
for environmentally critical projects and that they submitted a detailed
 and exhaustive EPRMP for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
study.
[47]
 It also maintained 
that an EPRMP, and not an EIS, was the appropriate report for the 
proposed project pursuant to DAO No. 2003-30. Since it is an EPRMP that 
is the proper form of study for the proposed project, Alltech posited 
that public hearing and project alternative are not required to secure 
an ECC.
[48]



The PRA manifested that it is adopting the Comment of Alltech.
[49]


The DENR-EMB, in its Comment,
[50]

 explained that the EPRMP is the proper EIA report pursuant to DAO No. 
2003-30 and that the absence of a public hearing and project alternative
 is of no consequence as it is not required in an EPRMP. Moreover, the 
DENR-EMB emphasized that the ECC, as a planning tool, did not trigger 
the actual implementation of the proposed project.
[51]





In their Comment, the cities of Las PiÃ±as
[52]
 and ParaÃ±aque insisted that the subject ECC was lawfully issued in accordance with the applicable laws and rules.
[53]






 


In her Manifestation and Motion filed on September 7, 2020, Villar urged
 the Court to take judicial notice of Republic Act No. (R.A.) 11038,
[54]

 otherwise known as the "Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas 
System Act of 2018" (ENIPAS). Section 4 of the ENIPAS lists among the 
protected areas under its coverage the LPPCHEA.
[55]

 Villar also asked the Court to take judicial notice of the Ramsar 
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as 
Waterfowl Habitat (Convention on Wetlands), an international treaty for 
the conservation and sustainable use of wetland where the Philippines is
 a signatory. On March 15, 2013, the Convention on Wetlands certified 
LLPCHEA as a "Wetland of National Importance."
[56]



Thereafter, Alltech filed a Motion for Leave to File Motion to Strike 
Out Petitioner's Manifestation and Motion with Counter-Manifestation 
Ad Cautelam
. Alltech clarified that: (1) LPPCHEA is outside the scope of the proposed project;
[57]

 (2) R.A. No. 11038 and the Convention on Wetlands do not prohibit 
reclamation on works in the periphery or surrounding areas of the 
LPPCHEA;
[58]
 (3) mitigating 
measures are designed to ensure that the proposed project will have no 
negative impact on the LPPCHEA during the construction and operation 
stages;
[59]
 and (4) not only can the project co-exist with the LPPCHEA, it can even assist in enhancing or improving it.
[60]



In their Motion for Leave to File Incorporated Rejoinder,
[61]
 Villar argued 
inter alia
 that the ECC issued in favor of Alltech is already 
functus officio

 as it had already been more than five years from the date of its 
issuance without the proposed project being implemented. Villar claimed 
that the baseline characteristics have significantly changed to the 
extent that the impact assessment is no longer appropriate.
[62]

 Villar also added that the concepts of Buffer Zone and Demarcation in 
the ENIPAS finds application as around 4.35 hectares of the LPPCHEA will
 have to be given up if the uniform 160-meter channel width of the 
ParaÃ±aque River will be built.
[63]


Issues



The issues to be resolved in this case are:


Whether the extraordinary remedy of filing a petition for writ of 
kalikasan
 is proper to assail the issuance of ECC No. CO-1101-0001 for Alltech's proposed project;




Whether the proposed project will cause environmental damage of
 such magnitude so as to prejudice the life, health, or property of 
residents of the cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque; and




Whether the proposed project impinges on the viability and sustainability of the LPPCHEA.



Ruling of the Court



The petition is not meritorious.






Villar failed to 
establish the causal link between the alleged irregularities in the 
issuance of Alltech's ECC to justify resorting to the extraordinary 
remedy of filing a petition for a writ of kalikasan.


 







To promote the government's environmental protection programs, P.D. No. 1586 was enacted declaring 
inter alia
 that:


No person, partnership or corporation shall undertake or 
operate any such declared environmentally critical project or area 
without first securing an 
Environmental Compliance Certificate
 issued by the President or his duly authorized representative. x x x
[64]
 (Emphasis supplied)



In the current structure of the government, it is the DENR-EMB, under 
the authority of the DENR Secretary, that is authorized to issue ECCs.



DAO No. 2003-30 delineates the rules and regulations to obtain an ECC 
under the Philippine EIS System (EIS System) established in P.D. No. 
1586. Through the EIS System, it is the government's objective to 
achieve a rational balance between the exigencies of socio-economic 
development and the requirements of environment protection for the 
benefit of present and future generations.
[65]



A petition for writ of 
kalikasan
 is an extraordinary remedy classified as a special civil action under the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases
[66]
 (RPEC). Under Section 1, Rule 7 of the RPEC:


Section 1. 
Nature of the Writ
. - The writ is a remedy
 available to a natural or juridical person, entity authorized by law, 
people's organization, non-governmental organization, or any public 
interest group accredited by or registered with any government agency, 
on behalf of persons whose constitutional right to a balanced and 
healthful ecology is violated, or threatened with violation by an 
unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or private 
individual or entity, involving environmental damage of such magnitude 
as to prejudice the life, health or property of inhabitants in two or 
more cities or provinces.



The essential requisites for the issuance of a writ of 
kalikasan
 
are: (1) there is an actual or threatened violation of the 
constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology; (2) the actual
 or threatened violation arises from an unlawful act or omission of a 
public official or employee, or private individual or entity; and (3) 
the actual or threatened violation involves or will lead to an 
environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health 
or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces. As a 
rule, the party claiming the privilege bears the 
onus
 of proving the requisites listed above.
[67]





In filing a petition for writ of 
kalikasan
, Villar argued at 
length the alleged irregularities in the issuance by the EMB of the ECC 
for the proposed project. However, it must be clarified that in 
assailing the issuance of an ECC, the proper remedy is to file an 
appeal. Section 6 of DAO No. 2003-30 provides:


Any party aggrieved by the final decision on the ECC/CNC 
applications may, within 15 days from receipt of such decision, file an 
appeal on the following grounds:


Grave abuse of discretion on the part of the deciding authority, or


Serious errors in the review findings.



The DENR may adopt alternative conflict/dispute resolution procedures as
 a means to settle grievances between proponents and aggrieved parties 
to avert unnecessary legal action. Frivolous appeals shall not be 
countenanced.


The proponent or any stakeholder may file an appeal to the following:






Deciding Authority


Where to file Appeal







EMB Regional Office Director



Office of the EMB Director






EMB General Office Director


Office of the DENR Secretary






DENR Secretary



Office of the President






Therefore, as a rule, any of the perceived irregularities in the 
issuance of the proposed project's ECC should be the subject of an 
appeal to the proper reviewing authority instead of a petition for writ 
of 
kalikasan
. Any alleged irregularity in the process undertaken 
to obtain the ECC should be threshed out in the proper forum before the 
appropriate reviewing authorities.



Nevertheless, in 
Paje v. CasiÃ±o
,
[68]
 the Court already recognized that the validity of an ECC may be challenged 
via
 a writ of 
kalikasan
. The Court, speaking through the 
ponencia
 of former Associate Justice Mariano C. Del Castillo, explained that:


The 
writ of kalikasan
 is principally predicated on an
 actual or threatened violation of the constitutional right to a 
balanced and healthful ecology, which involves environmental damage of a
 magnitude that transcends political and territorial boundaries. 
A 
party, therefore, who invokes the writ based on alleged defects or 
irregularities in the issuance of an ECC must not only allege and prove 
such defects or irregularities, but must also provide 
a causal link or, at least, a reasonable connection

 between the defects or irregularities in the issuance of an ECC and the
 actual or threatened violation of the constitutional right to a 
balanced and healthful ecology of the magnitude contemplated under the 
Rules.
 Otherwise, the petition should be dismissed outright and the 
action re-filed before the proper forum with due regard to the doctrine 
of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Otherwise, the petition should
 be dismissed outright and the action re-filed before the proper forum 
with due regard to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative 
remedies. This must be so if we are to preserve the noble and laudable 
purposes of the writ against those who seek to abuse it.
[69]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics in the original)


Unfortunately, while petitioners raised alleged irregularities in the issuance of the ECC (
i.e.
,
 the use of an improper form of assessment study, lack of public hearing
 and consultation, and absence of a project alternative), these are not 
material and necessary due to the nature of the proposed project. 
Therefore, no compelling reason was presented to warrant the 
intervention of the Court.






Alltech submitted the proper form of study required for the proposed project.


 







In securing an ECC, the proponent is required to submit a form of study 
depending on the classification of the proposed project under the EIS 
System. These reports include: (1) EIS; (2) Programmatic EIS; (3) 
Initial Environmental Examination Report; (4) Initial Environmental 
Examination Checklist; (5) Project Description Report (PDR); (6) EPRMP; 
and (7) Programmatic EPRMP (PEPRMP).







 


In Alltech's application, the DENR-EMB required an EPRMP which refers to
 a "documentation of the actual cumulative environmental impacts and 
effectiveness of current measures for single projects that are already 
operating but without ECCs."
[70]

 On the other hand, EIS pertains to a "document, prepared and submitted 
by the project proponent and/or EIA Consultant that serves as an 
application for an ECC. It is a comprehensive study of the significant 
impacts of a project on the environment. It includes an Environmental 
Management Plan/Program that the Proponent will fund and implement to 
protect the environment."
[71]
 
Based on this definition, an EIS is wider in scope than an EPRMP. 
However, it does not automatically mean that an EIS is the appropriate 
EIA report to be submitted in all projects. DAO No. 2003-30 provides for
 the conditions to consider in requiring the submission of a specific 
EIA report.



In paragraph (b), subsection 8, Section 1 of the Revised Procedural 
Manual for DAO No. 2003-30, the project contemplated for the use of 
EPRMP was explained as follows:


b) For operating projects with previous ECCs but planning or applying for clearance to modify/expand or 
re-start operations
,
 or for projects operating without an ECC but applying to secure one to 
comply with PD 1586 regulations, the appropriate document is not an EIS 
but an EIA Report incorporating the project's environmental performance 
and its current Environmental Management Plan. This report is either an (

Table 1-4, DAO No. 2003-30, states that an EPRMP is required for "Item 
I-B: Existing Projects for Modification or Re-start up (subject to 
conditions in Annex 2-1c) and I-C: Operating without ECC." From these 
definitions and tables, an EPRMP is the required EIA document type for 
an ECP-single project which is:


 Existing and to be expanded (including undertakings that have 
stopped operations for more than 5 years and plan to re-start with or 
without expansion);


Operating but without ECCs;


Operating projects with previous ECCs but planning or applying for clearance to modify/expand or re-start operations; and


Existing projects for modification or re-start up.




In 
Paje v. CasiÃ±o
,
[72]
 the Court noted that DAO No. 2003-30 and the Revised Manual appear to use the terms "operating" and "existing" interchangeably.





 


In the present case, the EPRMP that Alltech submitted was the proper 
form of study. As pointed out by the DENR-EMB, the proposed project is 
premised on the existence of a reclamation project covered by an ECC 
previously issued to the PEA, now PRA, and Amari (ECC No. 
CO-9602-002-208C) issued in September 1996. In the ECC issued to Alltech
 (ECC No. CO-1101-0001
[73]
) on March 24, 2011, it is clearly written that:


SUBJECT to the conditions and restrictions set out herein labeled as Annex A and Annex B. 
This Certificate supersedes/cancels ECC CO-9602-002-208C issued on September 16, 1996 by this Office.
 (Emphasis supplied)



The statement accentuated above is a recognition of an existing ECC 
superseded by the ECC issued in favor of Alltech. This also bolsters the
 view that operations are intended to be restarted as contemplated in 
paragraph (b), subsection 8, section 1 of the Revised Procedural Manual 
DAO 03-30. Under the Revised Procedural Manual for DAO No. 2003-30, the 
type of EIA report for a project which had previously operated or 
existing with previous ECCs intended to be modified, expanded or restart
 operations is not an EIS but an EPRMP or PEPRMP.
[74]

 As explained by the DENR-EMB, the entire area of the proposed project 
was within the area of the previous ECC issued in favor of the PEA and 
Amari on September 16, 1996 covering 750 hectares.
[75]



It is worthy to add that although the ECC in the PEA-Amari project failed to be completed, 
at
 the time the JVA between PEA and Amari was nullified by the Court, 
157.84 hectares of the 750-hectare project (which now comprises the 
Freedom Islands) had already been reclaimed
.
[76]

 Considering that partial operations had been conducted under the 
superseded ECC of the PEA-Amari project, the submission of the EPRMP by 
the project proponent who took over and replaced the original project 
was proper.



In 
Paje v. CasiÃ±o
,
[77]
 the Court ruled that the enumeration in DAO No. 2003-30 of what projects may be required to submit an EPRMP is 
not an exclusive list
. In 
Paje
,
 the Court upheld the EPRMP despite the seeming contradiction of the 
proposed coal fire plant of RP Energy to the definition of what projects
 may be covered by an EPRMP. The Court explained that:


x x x The definitions in DAO 2003-30 and the Revised Manual,
 stating that the EPM1P is applicable to (1) operating/existing projects
 with a previous ECC but planning or applying for modification or 
expansion, or (2) operating projects but without an ECC, were 
not
 an exclusive list.









 



The afore-discussed provisions of Figure 2-4, in relation to Annex 2-1c,
 plainly show that the EPRMP can, likewise, be used as an appropriate 
EIA document type for a single, non-implemented project applying for a 
major amendment to its ECC, involving an increase in capacity or 
auxiliary component, which will exceed PDR (non-covered project) 
thresholds, or result in the inability of the EMP and ERA to address the
 impacts and risks arising from the modification, such as the subject 
project.


That the proposed modifications in the subject project fall under this 
class or type of amendment was a determination made by the DENR-EMB and,
 
absent a showing of grave abuse of discretion, the DENR-EMB's 
findings are entitled to great respect because it is the administrative 
agency with the special competence or expertise to administer or 
implement the EIS System
.


The apparent confusion of the CasiÃ±o Group and the appellate court is 
understandable. They had approached the issue with a legal training 
mindset or background. As a general proposition, the definition of terms
 in a statute or rule is controlling as to its nature and scope within 
the context of legal or judicial proceedings. Thus, since the procedure 
adopted by the DENR-EMB seemed to contradict or go beyond the definition
 of terms in the relevant issuances, the CasiÃ±o Group and the appellate 
court concluded that the procedure was infirm.


However, a holistic reading of DAO 2003-30 and the Revised Manual will 
show that such a legalistic approach in its interpretation and 
application is unwarranted. This is primarily because 
the EIA process
 is a system, not a set of rigid rules and definitions. In the EIA 
process, there is much room for flexibility in the determination and use
 of the appropriate EIA document type as the foregoing discussion has 
shown. To our mind, what should be controlling is the guiding principle 
set in DAO 2003-30 in the evaluation of applications for amendments to 
ECCs, as stated in Section 8.3 thereof: "[r]equirements for processing 
ECC amendments shall depend on the 
nature of the request
 but shall be focused on the 
information necessary
 to assess the environmental impact of such changes.
"




This brings us to the next logical question, did the EPRMP provide the 
necessary information in order for the DENR-EMB to assess the 
environmental impact of RP Energy's request relative to the first 
amendment?




We answer in the affirmative.


x x x x



At any rate, we have examined the contents of the voluminous EPRMP 
submitted by RP Energy and we find therein substantial sections 
explaining the proposed changes as well as the adjustments that will be 
made in the environmental management plan in order to address the 
potential environmental impacts of the proposed modifications to the 
original project design. These are summarized in the "Project Fact 
Sheet" of the EPRMP and extensively discussed in Section 4 thereof. 
Absent
 any claim or proof to the contrary, we have no bases to conclude that 
these data were insufficient to assess the environmental impact of the 
proposed modifications. In accordance with the presumption of regularity
 in the performance of official duties, the DENR-EMB must be deemed to 
have adequately assessed the environmental impact of the proposed 
changes, before granting the request under the first amendment to the 
subject ECC.


In sum, 
the Revised Manual permits the use of an EPRMP, as the appropriate EIA document type, for major amendments to an ECC, 
even for an unimplemented or non-implemented project with a previous ECC
,
 such as the subject project. Consequently, we find that the procedure 
adopted by the DENR, in requiring RP Energy to submit an EPRMP in order 
to undertake the environmental impact assessment of the planned 
modifications to the original project design, relative to the first 
amendment to the ECC, suffers from no infirmity.




We apply the same framework of analysis in determining the propriety of a
 PDR, as the appropriate EIA document type, relative to the second 
amendment to the subject ECC.
[78]
 (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted; underscoring supplied)


In the present case, no grave abuse of discretion was proven to be 
attributed to the DENR-EMB in instructing the project proponent to file 
an EPRMP. Hence, it enjoys the presumption of regularity in the 
performance of its official duties. Based on its technical expertise, it
 found that the information provided in an EPRMP sufficiently addressed 
the environmental concerns of the government.





It is within the DENR-EMB's function and expertise to determine the 
category or classification of a proposed project as it is equipped with 
the knowledge and competence to resolve issues involving the highly 
technical field of EIS System. Alltech merely complied with the 
instruction of the DENR-EMB to submit an EPRMP. The project proponent 
should not be faulted for this as it is not in the position to 
substitute the assessment or technical opinion of the DENR-EMB with its 
own judgment. It is within the sphere of the technical knowledge and 
expertise of the DENR-EMB, and not the Court nor the project proponent, 
to determine the appropriate EIA report to submit for a particular 
project.



Moreover, the original PEA-Amari project and the current proposed 
project are similar in nature. Both projects involve reclamation and 
horizontal development of the project site intended for commercial, 
industrial and residential use in the future. It would have been 
different if the project proponent proposed to develop reclamation works
 and infrastructure intended for a totally foreign or different purpose 
from the superseded of PEA-Amari project such as a nuclear power plant 
or an airport. Here, the proposed project remained consistent with the 
objective of the superseded PEA-Amari project.



As correctly determined by the CA, the EPRMP Alltech submitted is a 
technical EIS due to its comprehensiveness. The EIARC took into 
consideration important issues such as flooding, the critical habitat, 
and the plight of fisherfolk who are residents within the project site 
itself.






A public hearing is not mandatory for the proposed project.


 







Section 5.3 of DAO No. 2003-30 provides:


5.3 Public Hearing / Consultation Requirements


For projects under Category A-1, the conduct of public hearing as part 
of the EIS review is mandatory unless otherwise determined by EMB. 
For all other undertakings, a public hearing is not mandatory unless specifically required by EMB.


Proponents should initiate public consultations early in order to ensure
 that environmentally relevant concerns of stakeholders are taken into 
consideration in the EIA study and the formulation of the management 
plan. All public consultations and public hearings conducted during the 
EIA process are to be documented. The public hearing/ consultation 
Process report shall be validated by the EMB/EMB RD and shall constitute
 part of the records of the EIA process.
[79]
 (Emphasis supplied)


In this case, the records disclosed that despite not being mandated to 
conduct a public hearing, Alltech held a consultation on November 25, 
2010 with representatives of concerned sectors such as the cities of 
ParaÃ±aque and Las PiÃ±as, PRA, the EIA consultants, the EIA case handler 
and Review Committee.
[80]
 
Identified stakeholders in the direct and indirect impact areas of the 
proposed project such as the Department of Tourism, the Partnerships for
 the Environmental Management of the Sea of Asia, and the United 
Cooperative Association of the Bulungan Fish Landing Site/Fisherman's 
Wharf likewise participated during the public consultation.
[81]








The CA determined 
that there is no actual or imminent threat that can be attributed to the
 proposed project that would prejudice the life, health, or property of 
residents of the cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque.


 







It must be understood that an ECC is not a permit to implement a 
project. Paragraph (d), Section 3 of the DAO No. 2003-30 defined ECC as:


d. Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC)-document 
issued by the DENR/EMB after a positive review of an ECC application, 
certifying that based on the representations of the proponent, the 
proposed project or undertaking will not cause significant negative 
environmental impact. The ECC also certifies that the proponent has 
complied with all the requirements of the EIS System and has committed 
to implement its approved Environmental Management Plan. The ECC 
contains specific measures and conditions that the project proponent has
 to undertake before and during the operation of a project, and in some 
cases, during the project's abandonment phase to mitigate identified 
environmental impacts.
[82]



Clearly, an ECC does not authorize the implementation of the proposed 
project. It is a planning tool that imposes restrictions that the 
proponent must diligently observe and duties that it must undertake to 
ensure that the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is protected. 
The proponent is expected to secure the pertinent permits and clearances
 from all concerned government agencies, such as those listed in Annex 
"B" of the ECC issued to Alltech, prior to the implementation of the 
project. The proponent will have to ensure compliance with all the 
conditions and requirements outlined in the ECC before it may commence 
the implementation of the proposed project.



Noticeably, the conditions in the ECC issued to Alltech require securing
 other permits and clearances that cannot be obtained without the 
participation of other stakeholders such as the cities of ParaÃ±aque and 
Las PiÃ±as and PRA. The concurrence of the listed government agencies in 
Annex "B" of the ECC such as the Department of Health, Department of 
Labor and Employment, Department of Public Works and Highways, 
Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, 
and Department of Social Welfare and Development must also be obtained. 
Considering that the proposed project still has to meet the conditions 
listed in its ECC before commencing construction, there is no actual or 
imminent threat of danger demonstrable at this stage of the proposed 
project. Thus, the petition of Villar is premature.




Furthermore, the perceived dangers posed by the proposed project were 
not established by Villar who bears the onus of proving her case. As 
properly determined by the CA, the companies commissioned by Villar, 
CEC-P and Tricore, failed to conduct a comprehensive and objective 
assessment of the proposed project and lacked the expertise necessary in
 the field of hydrology and hydraulics to competently conclude that the 
proposed project will cause environmental damage.
[83]


In referring the petition to the CA for hearing and reception of 
evidence, the CA made an exhaustive evaluation of the evidence 
presented, particularly the reports submitted reflecting the studies 
conducted to determine the impact of the project to the flooding 
conditions in the affected areas and its effect to LPPCHEA. We accord 
weight to the factual findings of the CA in identifying that no actual 
or imminent threat can be attributed to the proposed project that would 
prejudice the life, health, or property of residents of the cities of 
Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque.






According to the Tricore report, "the construction for the reclamation 
project will change the hydrodynamic characteristics of Manila bay that 
includes current wave actions, tidal fluctuations, and transport of 
sediments along the coasts that would restrict circulation of coastal 
water resulting to degradation of its water quality and environmental 
ecosystems."
[84]
 However, the 
Tricore report, which concluded that the proposed reclamation project 
would cause an increase in flood depth and inundate two-thirds of Las 
PiÃ±as, ParaÃ±aque and Bacoor, lacked sufficient basis.
[85]



The claim that the proposed project will cause flooding in the cities of
 Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque was already addressed in Alltech's EPRMP, the 
pertinent portion of which states:


As discussed during the Public Consultation, floodings are 
attributable to impairment in the flow of the ParaÃ±aque and Las PiÃ±as 
rivers 
due to cloggings from garbage
. There are no aspects of the construction and operations that would affect the rivers. 
Discharge channels are sufficiently provided to serve as the drainage outfalls
,
 as indicated in Figures 2.1 and 2.6. The ECC specifically contains the 
following conditions which are being integrated in the [ongoing] 
engineering works, "
8. The construction of two outlet channels for 
the Paranaque River Basin and Las PiÃ±as, Zapote River basin shall be 
implemented and maintained to improve drainage of the said rivers. 
Inland channel separating the reclamation and the mainland shall also be
 constructed and maintained to serve as reservoir and drainage of flood 
waters and high/low tide from the two rivers;
 "
[86]
 (Italics in the original; emphases and underscoring supplied)









 


Based on the Conceptual Drainage System Plan shown in Figure 3.4 of the EPRMP,
[87]
 no stream or river volumetric flows are affected since the outflow is Manila Bay.
[88]
 The drainage outfall of treated water is Manila Bay itself.
[89]
 Flooding will not be caused by the proposed project because:


Major impacts from reclamation activities would arise if a 
river system or a drainage system would be restricted or blocked. This 
is not the case with this particular project. As may be seen from 
Project Development Plan Map in Figure 2.4, pages 2-10, the final 
outflow ParaÃ±aque River to Manila Bay all remain unimpeded due to the 
provision of a River outlet fall while that of Las PiÃ±as River will be 
unobstructed. Further the drainage outfalls of the project will be the 
Manila Bay and away from these Rivers.


Also since only 635.14 hectares of the bay, portion of which had been 
previously reclaimed will be reclaimed out of a total 180,000 hectares 
of Manila Bay surface area (or 0.3%) the impacts are minimal. The 
incremental impact arising from the reduction of the reclamation area 
further reduces flooding concerns arising from the project.
[90]



In addition, the findings in Tricore's report were refuted by the 
measures that Alltech intends to adopt in order to avoid or reduce 
potential adverse impact of the proposed project. Among the engineering 
interventions proposed by Alltech are river flood control and drainage 
improvement works. These measures have been designed to anticipate a 
fully-urbanized ParaÃ±aque and Las PiÃ±as in year 2020.

Bulkhead structures will also be installed. In order to prevent

system will be installed behind the bulkhead walls. This measure will 
eliminate underground water pressure.
[95]



We agree with the observation of the CA that the study of CEC-P is 
inaccurate and unreliable as it depended on the EPRMP submitted in 
August 2010 and not the final EPRMP that the Alltech submitted in 
December 2010.
[96]
 This fact 
was revealed in the Judicial Affidavit of Frances Q. Quimpo, Executive 
Director of CEC-P, the pertinent portion of which is reproduced below:


QUESTION#14:
 Of the documents you spoke of a while 
ago, which of these did you use to form the basis for saying that the 
project proceeds from inadequate study?


ANSWER#14:
 The 
main document
 scrutinized in the course of 
this study is the Environmental Performance Report Management Plan 
(EPRMP) submitted by Alltech to the DENR on (sic) August 2010.


QUESTION#15:
 Why base your study on Alltech's EPRMP?


ANSWER#15:
 There were other materials that we relied on as data for our study. 
However,
 as the final report on Alltech's proposed management of the 
environmental impacts before the granting of the March 2011 ECC, the 
EPRMP is the source document on how the proponent expects its project to
 affect the landscape and ecology of the project site and what measures 
it has taken or will take to minimize the adverse effects that may be 
brought by this change.
[97]
 (Underscoring supplied; emphasis in the original)



It must be clarified that the Final EPRMP of Alltech was submitted in 
December 2010, and not in August 2010. Therefore, the study of CEC-P, 
that was based on wrong and inaccurate data, cannot be considered a 
reliable reference in concluding that the proposed project lacked clear 
scientific study on the flooding hazards of reclamation and the 
appropriate mitigation measures to be adopted by the project proponent.



In the determination of potential adverse effects of the proposed 
project on flooding and flushing, the CA heard and received evidence 
reflecting the Flooding Impact Assessment and Flushing Impact Assessment
 conducted. Various circumstances, including the potential worst-case 
scenarios, were simulated and recreated by experts contracted to 
identify possible flooding and flushing issues and to recommend 
mitigating measures to address these. The technical findings of the CA, 
which We reproduced below, explain the data-gathering method employed 
and the results of the hydraulics studies the DHI conducted:


The 
Flooding Impact Assessment
 looked at how the 
proposed reclamation would affect the existing flooding risks in the 
ParaÃ±aque, Las PiÃ±as and Zapote areas. In conducting the Flooding Impact
 Assessment, the following main factors of flooding were used: (a) 
rainfall runoff, or flooding caused by heavy rains running off into 
low-lying areas and rivers; and (b) coastal flooding, or flooding caused
 by storm surges. The water levels at the river mouth were compared 
between the predevelopment (baseline) and postÂ­development (reclamation)
 situation. The differences in water levels between the two scenarios 
were considered to be the incremental impact caused by the proposed 
reclan1ation. If the proposed reclamation does not cause any rise in the
 downstream water level during flood compared to the existing situation,
 there would not be any increased flooding further upstream. Computer 
models reflecting the present condition of the entire Manila Bay, 
including the site for the proposed reclamation, were set-up to 
establish the baseline condition. DHI used the available data on the 
frequency and maximum level of flooding in the area, as well as the data
 on rainfall levels. The effects of the proposed reclamation were 
evaluated using a computer model simulating the extreme rainfall runoff 
and extreme storm surge scenarios. A 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model of
 the entire Manila Bay was setup. Bathymetry information was taken from 
the electronic navigation chart with reference to the Philippines Chart 
Datum at Mean Low Low Water ("MLLW"). In order to establish the maximum 
water level conditions for the baseline situation, DHI obtained 
historical rainfall data for the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque area from the 
Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services 
Administration (PAGASA). DHI also used the data obtained by DCCD from 
the flood assessment survey it conducted in August 2011 regarding the 
frequency and maximum flood levels within a 1-km radius from the mouths 
of the ParaÃ±aque, Las PiÃ±as, and Zapote Rivers. Secondary data from the 
local governments of ParaÃ±aque and Las PiÃ±as were also incorporated in 
the DCCD data. Given that the Study was concerned with continuous 
simulation of the rainfall runoff response, it was necessary to generate
 rainfall time-series data. Rather than simply calculating peak 
discharge values as DCCD had done, DHI used a full rainfall-runoff 
time-series. 
The flood risk assessments were simulated using the worst case scenarios, 
i.e.
 with the highest astronomical tide coupled with an extreme storm surge or rainfall runoff event.


The results of the assessment showed that for each of the rivers, the 
proposed reclamation, without any mitigating measure, would result in 
increases in the maximum water levels at the river mouths, particularly 
the Las PiÃ±as-Zapote rivers, which would increase the risk of flooding 
during the heavy rainfall runoff event. In terms of flood risk during a 
storm surge, the proposed reclamation would act as a storm surge barrier
 for the ParaÃ±aque area. However, it has a funneling effect in the Las 
PiÃ±as and Zapote areas, resulting in higher water levels in the northern
 end of the southern lagoon. Based on the results of the modeling, DHI 
proposed mitigation measures to avoid increasing the water levels or 
backwater impact between the predevelopment and postÂ­development 
conditions at the river mouths. Various combinations of the following 
mitigation measures were simulated in order to test their effectiveness:


"1) Removal of the sandbar at the confluence of the Las PiÃ±as and Zapote Rivers;

2) Dredging of the channel in front of ParaÃ±aque River to -6 meters MLLW;

3) Dredging the area between the Las PiÃ±as and Zapote Rivers to -4 meters MLLW;

4) Building a flood or sluice gate at the ParaÃ±aque causeway joining the islands; and

5) Building a 100-meter buffer zone and lagoon infill."


Based on the results of the computer simulations of the effects of the 
proposed reclamation and of the possible mitigation measures, it was 
found that if the following mitigation measures were implemented, all 
the negative impacts are removed:


"Maintaining a minimum width of 160 meters in the ParaÃ±aque 
River extension, and dredging to deepen it by an average of 2 to 3 
meters in order to improve drainage of the ParaÃ±aque River;

Dredging to deepen the entrance to the southern lagoon by an average of 1
 meters, and removing the sandbar immediately offshore from the mouth of
 the Las PiÃ±as River in order to improve the drainage of the Las PiÃ±as 
and Zapote Rivers; and

Installation of a sluice gate, approximately 35 meters wide, in the 
causeway separating the two lagoons, in order to allow improved drainage
 and flushing of the lagoons."


According to DHI, if all the foregoing mitigation measures were 
implemented, including the removal of the sandbar, deepening and 
widening of the ParaÃ±aque river extension and the entrance to the 
southern lagoon, the proposed reclamation would significantly improve 
the drainage in the rivers, and remove all the potential negative impact
 of the proposed reclamation. The modeling simulations predicted that if
 all the mitigation measures were taken, there would be a positive 
impact for ParaÃ±aque and Zapote and no impact at Las PiÃ±as in case of 
heavy rainfall. The positive impact indicates that the river mouth 
discharge condition would be improved, potentially reducing upstream 
flood risk. In the case of storm surges, the mitigating measures would 
have a positive effect on the ParaÃ±aque area, with reduced surge 
effects. While there would still be a small residual increase in water 
level at Las PiÃ±as and Zapote areas, this would not be measurable in the
 field, resulting in zero impact, particularly since the Las 
PiÃ±as/Zapote area is protected by the elevated Manila-Cavite expressway,
 which also acts as a storm surge flood barrier. The reclamation would 
also have a positive impact in protecting the western side of the lagoon
 which is presently eroding.


In conclusion, the flooding impact assessment indicates that the 
proposed reclamation, with the recommended mitigation measures 
implemented, has negligible to positive impact for the ParaÃ±aque, Las 
PiÃ±as and Zapote areas. The proposed reclamation, with the recommended 
mitigation measures, can bring positive impact to the river mouth 
passage conditions, and potentially reduce the risk of upstream 
flooding. During storm surge, the reclamation has a positive impact at 
the ParaÃ±aque area, protecting it and reducing the surge effects. At the
 Las PiÃ±as site, the model showed the storm surge to increase the water 
level by 2 to 3 cm. However, this would not be detectable in the field 
and has zero impact towards coastal flooding as the area is protected by
 the elevated Manila-Cavite expressway. In addition, the reclamation 
will have positive impact in terms of protecting the western side of the
 lagoon which is presently eroding.




The DHI 
Flushing Impact Assessment
 looked into the potential 
changes to the flushing of the lagoons as a result of the proposed 
reclamation. Flushing time is a measure of water mass retention within 
the defined boundary, and provides a description of mass balance and 
transport dynamics in the lagoons. This is a good indicator of 
conditions in the lagoon, especially with regard to variations to 
salinity, suspended sediments, and contaminant transport. In other words
 flushing can be used to evaluate changes in water quality, such as 
salinity, nutrients, and even sediment exchange in the lagoons. The 
Flushing Impact Assessment was conducted to determine whether the 
proposed reclamation would have any negative impact on the residence or 
flushing time or water exchange rate in the lagoon system which may 
adversely affect the habitat, specifically the mangroves. Considering 
that the flushing is very sensitive to rainfall as well as to tidal 
conditions, two flushing scenarios were studied: (a) the wet season 
during the monsoon, with peak river runoffs; and (b) the dry season 
during the non-monsoon, with no discharges from the rivers. After the 
assessment, it was found that under the present conditions, during the 
dry season, both the lagoons are currently, poorly flushed due to the 
relatively weak tidal regime and shallow inter-tidal area. Under the 
present conditions, during the wet season, flushing is improved due to 
stronger tidal forcing and additional discharge into the lagoon from the
 rivers.


Based on the flushing model, the following mitigation measures were 
recommended to remove the negative impacts of the proposed reclamation, 
and to improve the current flushing condition in the lagoons:


a. Dredging and maintaining the extension of the ParaÃ±aque river to a depth of -6 meters;

b. Dredging and maintaining the Las PiÃ±as/Zapote river mouths to a depth of -4meters;

c. Removal of the sand bar at the Las PiÃ±as mouth; and

d. Provision of a 35-meter wide sluice gate and operational procedure for the causeway.


During the dry season, if the suggested mitigating measure of installing
 a sluice gate is taken and it is kept open at all times, there is a 
slight negative impact in the lagoon due to the generally poor flushing 
during the dry season. However, if the suggested sluice gate is operated
 only during flood events or during optimal tide conditions and kept 
closed during the rest of the time, a positive effect could be achieved.
 During the wet season, the addition of the sluice gate significantly 
improves the flushing during the wet season. Provided the sluice gate 
and other mitigating measures are implemented, a positive overall impact
 on flushing can be expected from the proposed reclamation. The sluice 
gate can be operated to improve the flushing beyond the present day 
environmental condition of the lagoons.


In conclusion, DHI's hydraulic studies show that, at worst, the proposed
 reclamation will have no flooding and flushing impacts provided the 
recommended mitigation measures are implemented. On the other hand, the 
proposed reclamation can improve the existing situation provided the 
recommended mitigation measures are taken. The DHI documented their 
study by preparing a Final Report on the Model Setups, Results, and 
Impacts Assessment of the Flooding and Flushing Study, entitled "Manila 
Bay Coastal 21 Flooding and Flushing Study Model Setups, Results and 
Impacts Assessment."
[98]
 (Emphasis supplied)


DHI presented a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of the 
implementation of the proposed project. The findings of DHI is supported
 by the Flooding Impact Assessment and a Flushing Impact Assessment 
conducted that adds credibility and persuasive value to the proposed 
project.







 


DCCD also presented its flood assessment survey entitled Coastal 21 
Hydrologic and Flood Study, wherein it was determined that the current 
flooding problems in the Las PiÃ±as/ParaÃ±aque areas were largely due to 
the fact that the existing drainage system cannot adequately drain the 
low lying areas. DCCD explained that:


[I]n case of extreme events, no significant difference in 
flood levels between the scenario with the reclamation and the existing 
conditions is expected, if the uniform width of 160 meters up to the 
existing bridge for the ParaÃ±aque channel will be implemented adjacent 
to the reclamation project. The construction of the uniform 160-meter 
channel, however, entails giving up around 4.35 hectares of the Critical
 Habitat. 
The widening of the existing channel will actually prevent flooding.
 This is because the bird sanctuary/critical habitat constricts the channel flow from the ParaÃ±aque River. However, 
even
 by excluding entirely the Critical Habitat from the reclamation 
project, the local flooding being experienced can still be alleviated by
 freeing the rivers of garbage, debris, silt, informal settlers along 
the banks and other obstructions in the rivers. The street drainage 
system also needs to be improved especially in the low-lying areas where
 ponding occur. 
A major factor to the local flooding is the Manila 
Coastal Road, which is a road on reclaimed land along the coast and acts
 as a dike preventing the runoff from freely draining towards the bay.

 The adequacy of the culverts and widths of the existing bridges to the 
bay need to be evaluated as well. Forecasts on water elevations at the 
outlets of the Las PiÃ±as-Zapote rivers were generated in case of extreme
 events.
[99]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)



Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the proposed project will not 
aggravate flooding as DCCD had already identified the factors that cause
 flooding in the areas affected. It is worthy to point out that a major 
factor to the local flooding is the Manila Coastal Road, which is a road
 on reclaimed land along the coast and acts as a dike preventing the 
runoff from freely draining towards Manila Bay. Poor drainage system, 
obstructions in rivers, and the geographical layout of the Manila 
Coastal Road are the identified contributing factors in the flooding 
problems in Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque. With the implementation of the 
proposed project, and adopting the mitigating measures included in the 
proposed project. The communities will actually benefit as engineering 
interventions will be introduced to address the flooding issues.





Between the study conducted by CEC-P and those produced by DCCD, 
Surbana, and DHI, We are inclined to give more weight to the studies 
commissioned by Alltech which appear to be duly supported by scientific 
research. Unlike CEC-P, Surbana has amassed over 45 years of experience 
in planning and managing land reclamation and coastal development.
[100]

 It has undertaken various reclamation and coastal development projects 
worldwide, including the Tanjong Rhu and the East Coast reclamation 
projects in Singapore.
[101]



In its Closing Report,
[102]
 
Surbana highlighted its reclamation project next to the Kota Kinabalu 
City Bird Sanctuary, the only remaining patch of mangrove forest found 
in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. Surbana opined that the success of this 
project proves that a bird sanctuary can coexist alongside a land 
reclamation project.
[103]
 
Surbana also mentioned the Pulau Ular Reclamation Project in Singapore 
which was developed approximately 200 meters from a critical habitat, 
Singapore's only public access recreational dive area with good quality 
coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove habitats.
[104]
 Surbana recommended conducting a flood and flushing study
[105]
 and made the following conclusion:


The development of the Project, with a commitment to 
minimizing negative physical, biological and social environmental 
impacts at the design stage, and a wellÂ­considered EMMP during 
construction and operation can be expected to improve the environmental 
status of the LPPCHEA area when benchmarked against experience from 
similar international sites.
[106]



As have been already discussed, following the recommendation of Surbana,
 Alltech engaged the services of DHI to carry out hydrologic and 
hydrodynamic study to evaluate the potential flooding and t1ushing 
impacts of the proposed project.
[107]
 The flood risk assessments made by DHI were simulated using projected worst-case scenarios; 
i.e.
,
 with the highest astronomical tide coupled with an extreme storm surge 
or rainfall runoff event, extreme wind conditions, and climate change.
[108]





While Villar's intention in taking a proactive role in advancing her 
constituents' right to a balanced and healthful ecology is laudable, the
 Court cmmot simply apply the extraordinary remedy of a Writ of 
Kalikasan
 to all environmental issues elevated to Us. In 
Paje v. CasiÃ±o
,
[109]
 the Court clarified that:


The function of the extraordinary and equitable remedy of a Writ of 
Kalikasan
 should not supplant other available remedies and the nature of the forums that they provide. 
The Writ of 
Kalikasan

 is a highly prerogative writ that issues only when there is a showing 
of actual or imminent threat and when there is such inaction on the part
 of the relevant administrative bodies that will make an environmental 
catastrophe inevitable.
 It is not a remedy that is availing when there is no actual threat or when imminence of danger is not demonstrable. 
The Writ of 
Kalikasan

 thus is not an excuse to invoke judicial remedies when there still 
remain administrative forums to properly address the common concern to 
protect and advance ecological rights.
 After all, 
we cannot presume that only the Supreme Court can conscientiously fulfill the ecological duties required of the entire state.
[110]
 (Emphases supplied)


The writ of 
kalikasan
 is not a remedy that may be availed when 
there is no actual threat or when the imminence of danger is not 
apparent to justify judicial intervention. To Our mind, the writ of 
kalikasan

 should only be availed in extraordinary circumstances that require the 
immediate attention of the Court and cannot be arbitrarily invoked when 
remedies are available in administrative agencies to properly address 
and resolve concerns involving protection of ecological rights.






The precautionary principle is not applicable to the present case.


 







The precautionary principle is one of the key features introduced in the
 RPEC wherein the burden of proof is shifted to the proponent of a 
project to dispel concerns regarding potential harmful impacts of a 
project to the environment. Section 1, Rule 20 of the RPEC states:




Section 1. 
Applicability
. - When there is a lack of 
full scientific certainty in establishing a causal link between human 
activity and environmental effect, the court shall apply the 
precautionary principle in resolving the case before it.


The constitutional right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology shall be given the benefit of the doubt.
[111]


It is not meant to apply to all environmental cases. Essential to the 
application of the precautionary principle is the presence of scientific
 uncertainty.



In the present case, We find no reason to apply the precautionary 
principle to favor Villar as the proponent had sought the assistance of 
experts to allay the concerns of stakeholders who will be affected by 
the implementation of the proposed project. As explained by the CA, the 
threat was not established and the volumes of data generated by 
objective and expert analyses ruled out the scientific uncertainty of 
the nature and scope of the anticipated threat.
[112]






There is no sufficient basis to hold that the proposed project will impinge on the viability and sustainability of LPPCHEA.


 






The State's primary framework for biodiversity conservation is found in 
the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1992.
[113]
 Thereafter, the Congress enacted the ENIPAS
[114]

 to enlarge the scope of the original list of identified protected areas
 in NIPAS and add 94 more critical habitats nationwide. Section 4 of 
R.A. No. 11038 establishes LPPCHEA as a "protected area" or a portion of
 land and/or water set aside by reason of its "unique physical and 
biological significance, manages to enhance biological diversity and 
protected against destructive human exploitation."
[115]

 Nevertheless, this development does not substantially alter Our 
decision to affirm the ruling of the CA denying Villar's petition for 
the issuance of a writ of 
kalikasan
 due to the reasons discussed 
above. It must be clarified that the classification of LPPCHEA as a 
"protected area" under the ENIPAS does not automatically result to a 
prohibition of reclamation activities within the area, or alongside it. 
There is nothing in the NIPAS and ENIPAS expressly declaring that 
reclamation activities within or alongside a critical habitat is an 
incompatible activity that is not allowed.





Moreover, the metes and bounds of the LPPCHEA remain intact. No portion 
of the LPPCHEA will be utilized for the proposed project, as shown in 
the geographical illustrations
[116]

 submitted by Alltech and its consultants. Even the Tricore report 
Villar commissioned acknowledged that LPPCHEA was located adjacent to 
the project site.
[117]
 This 
recognition is critical in validating the assertion of Alltech that no 
portion of the proposed project will traverse the LPPCHEA.



Out of the 175-hectare area of LPPCHEA, the alleged 4.3 hectares of the 
critical habitat mentioned by DHI that would be utilized in the event 
that the ParaÃ±aque river channel with a width of 160 meters is developed
 is not final and remains a proposal and will still be subject to the 
approval of the government through the appropriate agencies. Even 
assuming that the 4.3 hectares of the critical habitat will be utilized,
 reclamation activities within or alongside a critical habitat is not 
prohibited under the NIPAS and ENIPAS. Therefore, the perceived negative
 impact of the proposed project to LPPCHEA's viability and 
sustainability remains unsubstantiated.






ECC No. CO-1101-0001 is not rendered functus officio despite the lapse of five years from its issuance.


 







With regard to the validity and expiry of Alltech's ECC, paragraph (d), 
item no. 10, chapter 1.0 of the Revised Procedural Manual for DAO No. 
2003-30 provides that:


d) 
ECC Validity and Expiry:
 Once a project is 
implemented, the ECC remains valid and active for the lifetime of the 
project ECC conditions and commitments are permanently relieved from 
compliance by the Proponent only upon validation by the EMB of the 
successful implementation of the environmental aspects/component of the 
Proponent's Abandonment/ Rehabilitation/ Decommissioning Plan. This 
pre-condition for ECC validity applies to all projects including those 
wherein ECC expiry dates have been specified in the ECC. However, the 
ECC automatically expires if a project has not been implemented within 
five (5) years from ECC issuance, or if the ECC was not requested for 
extension within three (3) months from the expiration of its validity. 
If
 the baseline characteristics have significantly changed to the extent 
that the impact assessment as embodied in the Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) is no longer appropriate, the EMB office concerned shall 
require the Proponent to submit a new application. The EIA Report on the
 new application shall focus only on the assessment of the environmental
 component which significantly changed.
 (Emphasis in the original, underscoring supplied)




In the present case, the ECC of Alltech is not automatically rendered 
functus officio

 simply because the proposed project was not executed within five years 
from March 24, 2011, the date the EMB issued ECC No. CO-1101-0001. It 
must be highlighted that the project proponent was not the reason that 
the immediate implementation of the proposed project was forestalled. It
 was the filing of the petition for writ of 
kalikasan
 that led to
 the delay in carrying out the proposed project. Any revision to the ECC
 because of the lapse of time is for the DENR-EMB to decide.






Participation of the country as a contracting party in the Convention on Wetlands does not proscribe the proposed project.


 







Lastly, while the Court acknowledges the international responsibilities 
of the Philippines, as a Contracting Party of the Convention on 
Wetlands, for the wise use of all designated wetlands of international 
importance in the country, this does not mean that a reclamation project
 alongside or adjacent a designated wetland is absolutely prohibited. 
Paragraph 3, Article 2 of the Convention on Wetlands of International 
Importance especially Waterfowl Habitat
[118]
 states:


3. The inclusion of a wetland in the List does not prejudice
 the exclusive sovereign rights of the Contracting Party in whose 
territory the wetland is situated.
[119]



It is clear that the classification of an area as a wetland of 
international importance does not diminish the control the government 
exercises over the wetlands and adjacent areas within its territory. The
 government may continue to utilize these areas as it may deem 
beneficial for all its stakeholders. Here, the government, through the 
DENR, found Alltech's proposal and studies conducted sufficient to allay
 the concerns of the stakeholders.

DISSENTING OPINION


LEONEN, J.:


Regretfully but with great respect to the majority, I dissent.



The Department of Environment and Natural Resources should have required
 the proponent to submit an environmental impact statement, and not 
merely the Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan, as part
 of the Environmental Impact Assessment. The Court of Appeals should not
 have merely relied on the Department's findings to conclude that an 
environmental impact statement was not required. It should always take a
 harder look at the parties' submissions.



This case involves a reclamation project near a protected bird sanctuary
 and mangrove forest. Nearby residents have expressed concerns that the 
reclamation project may cause flooding in their neighborhoods. This must
 be weighed in a petition for the issuance of a writ of kalikasan.



In 2009, Alltech Contractors, Inc. (Alltech) submitted unsolicited 
proposals to Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque for the development, financing, 
engineering, design, and reclamation of 381.26 hectares of land in Las 
PiÃ±as and 174.88 hectares of land for ParaÃ±aque, both along the coast of
 the Manila Bay. Each city's Sangguniang Panlungsod later issued a 
resolution authorizing its mayor to explore the proposal under a Joint 
Venture Agreement. Later on, Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque accepted the 
proposal and executed their respective Joint Venture Agreements.
[1]









In 2010, the Philippine Reclamation Authority approved the Las PiÃ±as and
 ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project, subject to full compliance with laws, 
rules, and regulations. Alltech was then directed to submit an 
environmental performance report management plan, instead of an 
environmental impact statement, as basis for the issuance of an 
environmental compliance certificate.
[2]





In December 2010, Alltech submitted its final Environmental Performance 
Report Management Plan, which involved the reclamation of around 203.43 
hectares along the coast of ParaÃ±aque and 431.171 hectares along the 
coast of Las PiÃ±as. This area was also within the 750-hectare site known
 as the Amari Coastal Bay Development Corporation, covered by ECC No. 
CO-9602-002-208C.
[3]



On March 24, 2011, the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources-Environmental Management Bureau issued ECC No. CO-1101-0001 
covering the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project.
[4]



On March 16, 2012, then Las PiÃ±as Representative Cynthia A. Villar 
(Villar), representing 315,849 residents, filed a Petition for a writ of
 kalikasan before this Court. She prayed that the project be enjoined as
 it will, among others, cause massive Hooding to the residents in the 
area.
[5]



On April 24, 2012, this Court issued the writ against Alltech, 
Philippine Reclamation Authority, Environmental Management Bureau, and 
the cities of Las PiÃ±as, ParaÃ±aque, and Bacoor, Cavite. The case was 
remanded to the Court of Appeals for the necessary hearings, reception 
of evidence, and rendition of judgment.
[6]



On April 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision
[7]

 denying the Petition for lack of merit. It found that the Environmental
 Performance Report Management Plan was also a form of environmental 
impact assessment and that an environmental impact statement was 
required only for new projects. Since the current reclamation project 
was already within the Amari Coastal Bay Development Project, the Court 
of Appeals found that the statement was unnecessary. It likewise noted 
that the submission of the Environmental Performance Report Management 
Plan, in lieu of an environmental impact statement, was the 
Environmental Management Bureau's decision, and not Alltech's. It 
pointed out that baseline data gathered in 1996 as basis for the 
Environmental Performance Report Management Plan did not make the data 
inaccurate or outdated, but instead required Alltech to meet a higher 
standard, since the basis would be the better quality of environment in 
1990.
[8]





After her Motion for Reconsideration had been denied, Villar filed this 
Petition. She argues, among others, that the issuance of the Environment
 Compliance Certificate for Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project 
was illegal since respondent Alltech did not submit the appropriate 
Environment Impact Assessment study. She likewise contends that the 
project impinges on the viability and sustainability of the Las 
PiÃ±asÂ­ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area, which was 
certified as a Wetland of National Importance in 2013.
[9]





The majority, however, upheld the Court of Appeals Decision, finding:


In the present case, the EPRMP Alltech submitted was the 
proper form of study. As pointed out by the DENR-EMB, the proposed 
project is premised on the existence of a reclamation project covered by
 an ECC previously issued to the Philippine Estates Authority (PEA), now
 PRA, and Amari (ECC No. CO-9602-002-208C) issued in September 1996....


....



... Under the Revised Procedural Manual for DAO No. 2003-30, the type of
 EIA report for a project which had previously operated or existing with
 previous ECCs intended to be modified, expanded or re-start operations 
is not an EIS but an EPRMP or PEPRMP. As explained by the DENR-EMB, the 
entire area of the proposed project was within the area of the previous 
ECC issued in favor of the PEA and Amari on September 16, 1996 covering 
750 hectares.



....



It is within the DENR-EMB's function and expertise to determine the 
category or classification of a proposed project as it is equipped with 
the knowledge and competence to resolve issues involving the highly 
technical field of EIS system....



....



As correctly determined by the CA, the EPRMP Alltech submitted is a 
technical EIS due to its comprehensiveness. The EIARC took .into 
consideration important issues such as flooding, the critical habitat, 
and the plight of fisherfolk who are residents within the project site 
itself.
[10]
 (Citations omitted)












The majority likewise found that the classification of the Las 
PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area as a "protected 
area" did not result in the prohibition of reclamation activities since 
there was nothing in the law that expressly disallowed it.
[11]





I disagree.



Respondent Alltech should have been ordered to submit an environmental 
impact statement. This is the appropriate environmental impact 
assessment study necessary to issue an environmental compliance 
certificate for the Coastal Bay Project.


I



For every project or undertaking that may significantly affect the environment's quality, Presidential Decree No. 1586
[12]

 requires an environmental impact statement under an Environmental 
Impact Statement System to be established by the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources.
[13]

 This system "is concerned primarily with assessing the direct and 
indirect impacts of a project on the biophysical and human environment 
and ensuring that these impacts are addressed by appropriate 
environmental protection and enhancement measures."
[14]



An environmental impact assessment, meanwhile, is a "process that 
involves predicting and evaluating the likely impacts of a project 
(including cumulative impacts) on the environment during construction, 
commissioning, operation and abandonment. It also includes designing 
appropriate preventive, mitigating and enhancement measures addressing 
these consequences to protect the environment and the community's 
welfare."
[15]



Under the Revised Manual for Department of Environment and Natural Resources Administrative Order No. 2003-30:


There are seven (7) major EIA Report types for which 
preparation and application procedures have been provided in this 
Manual. Table 1-4 presents the report type per project sub-group.














a) For new projects: EIA-covered projects in Groups I, II and IV are 
required either an (1) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), (2) 
Programmatic EIS (PEIS), (3) Initial Environmental Examination Report 
(IEER) or (4), IEE Checklist (IEEC), depending on project type, 
location, magnitude of potential impacts and project threshold. For 
non-covered projects in Groups II and III, a (5) Project Description 
Report (PDR) is the appropriate document to secure a decision from 
DENR/EMB. The PDR is a "must" requirement for environmental enhancement 
and mitigation projects in both ECAs (Group II) and NECAs (Group III) to
 allow EMB to confirm the benign nature of proposed operations for 
eventual issuance of a Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC). All other 
Group III (non-covered) projects do not need to submit PDRs - 
application is at the option of the Proponent should it need a CNC for 
its own purposes, e.g. financing prerequisite. For Group V projects, a 
PDR is required to ensure new processes/technologies or any new unlisted
 project does not pose harm to the environment. The Group V PDR is a 
basis for either issuance of a CNC or classification of the project into
 its proper project group.





b) For operating projects with previous ECCs but planning for applying 
for clearance to modify/expand or re-start operations, or for projects 
operating without an ECC but applying to secure one to comply with PD 
1586 regulations, the appropriate document is not an EIS but an EIA 
Report incorporating the project's environmental performance and its 
current Environmental Management Plan. This report is either an (6) 
Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan (EPRMP) for single 
project applications or a (7) Programmatic EPRMP (PEPRMP) for co-located
 project applications. However, for small project modifications, an 
updating of the project description or the Environmental Management Plan
 with the use of the proponent's historical performance and monitoring 
records may suffice.
[16]





Under these regulations, an environmental impact statement is required 
for new projects. For "operating projects with previous ECCs but 
planning or applying for clearance to modify/expand or re-start 
operations, or for projects operating without an ECC but applying to 
secure one to comply with PD 1586 regulations," an environmental 
performance report and management plan will be submitted.





The difference is obvious: An environmental impact statement is a new 
and in-depth environmental impact assessment study on a specific project
 site, while an environmental performance report and management plan is a
 mere update a prior environmental impact assessment study already made 
on the same site. As petitioner correctly pointed out:


138. The rationale behind requiring only an EPRMP for 
projects that have operated initially is to dispense with needless 
submissions of new studies as there presumably exists a number of useful
 data about the actual environmental impacts of a project as observed. 
Of course, there is no need to duplicate the tedious processes of an 
Environmental Impact Statement when the effects of a project have been 
recorded upon its implementation and where historical environmental 
performance and status of the project and its management plan are 
already known.




139. Given a project that had operated but stopped for a period of more 
than five (5) years, what is required is an environmental impact report 
on how well the mitigation and enhancement measures worked, using its 
environmental management plan ("EMP") as a yardstick. The convenience of
 preparing an EPRMP leaves the proponent to focus on ways to enact 
improvements on a project that has been implemented and has operated 
with plans for modification, expansion or a restart. This shortcut 
allows the proponent to suggest modifications and changes in the 
original plan to augment environmental performance without the costly 
distraction of undertaking a comprehensive environmental impact 
statement study.
[17]



The Court of Appeals found that the Environmental Performance Report and
 Management Plan's submission was appropriate since a prior 
Environmental Compliance Certificate had already been issued for Amari 
Coastal Bay Project in 1996.



This Project, however, 
was never implemented
.
[18]

 Thus, there would be no basis for any historical environmental impact 
data. There would be no viable report or update on the effect of prior 
mitigation measures and environmental plans already implemented. Amari 
Coastal Bay Project's ECC No. CO-9602-002-208C required, among others:


8. The construction of two outlet channels for the ParaÃ±aque
 River Basin and Las PiÃ±as, Zapote River Basin shall be implemented and 
maintained to improve drainage of the said rivers. Inland channel 
separating the reclamation and the mainland shall also be constructed 
and maintained to serve as reservoir and drainage of flood waters and 
high/low tide from the two rivers.
[19]
 (Citation omitted)



No evidence was presented showing that these two outlet channels had 
already been constructed, and that these continue to improve drainage 
among the identified rivers. In contrast, respondent Alltech appears to 
have tacitly recognizing that such outlet channels were ever 
implemented, since the outlet channels were part of their proposed 
engineering works:




As discussed during the Public Consultation, floodings are 
attributable to impairment in the flow of the ParaÃ±aque and Las Pi[Ã±]as 
rivers due to cloggings from garbage. There are no aspects of the 
construction and operations that would affect the rivers. Discharge 
channels are sufficiently provided to serve as the drainage outfalls, as
 indicated in Figures 2.1 and 2.6. The EC specifically contains the 
following conditions which are being integrated in the ongoing 
engineering works, "8. The construction of two outlet channels for the 
ParaÃ±aque River Basin and Las Pi[Ã±]as, Zapote River basin shall be 
implemented and maintained to improve drainage of the said rivers. 
Inland channel separating the reclamation and the mainland shall also be
 constructed and maintained to serve as reservoir and drainage of flood 
waters and high/low tide from the two rivers[.]"
[20]





The proposed construction, based on their Conceptual Drainage System 
Plan, appears to also expand or modify the requirement of an inland 
channel separating the reclamation and the mainland:


Major impact from reclamation activities would arise if a 
river system or a drainage system would be restricted or block[ed]. This
 is not the case with this particular project. As may be seen from 
Project Development Plan Map in Figure 2.4, page 2-10, the final outflow
 Paranaque River to Manila Bay all remain unimpeded due to the provision
 of a River outlet fall while that of Las Pi[Ã±]as River will be 
unobstructed. Further the drainage outfalls of the project will be the 
Manila Bay and away from these rivers.




Also since only 635.14 hectares of the bay, portion of which had been 
previously reclaimed will be reclaimed out of a total 180,000 hectares 
of Manila Bay surface area (or 0.3%) the impacts are minimal. The 
incremental impact arising from the reduction of the reclamation area 
further reduces flooding concerns arising from the project.
[21]



Amari Coastal Bay Project's ECC No. CO-9602-002-208C, however, provides:


20. Any expansion or modification of the original plans not identified in the approved EIS shall undergo the EIS process.
[22]



The Environmental Impact Assessment Review Committee's Comments and Chairman's Report
[23]

 should have also placed the Court of Appeals on guard as to the scope 
of review undertaken. In particular, it states the following unresolved 
issues:






Issues, Concerns, Problems 


Response or Remarks 






1. Nature of the ECC being applied for, 
whether it is for expansion of coverage of the old ECC earlier issued or
 application for a new one


Has not been resolved. The committee at the 
onset has been appraised both by the accounts of the EIS, the 
proponents, and the case handler that the ECC being applied for is an 
expansion of coverage of the earlier ECC earlier [sic] issued by the 
EMB; this was during the first meeting. The new case handler who has 
taken over the work of the earlier case handler, however, has said that 
the ECC being 
applied for is being treated as a new one.






2. Need for new data


Has only been resolved partly. All the 
members of the committee have noted that almost all of the data included
 in the draft EIS involve secondary material from the earlier EIS 
submitted; there has been explicit recommendation from Mr. Ben 
Francisco, member of the Rev Com and a fisheries expert, that data on 
the municipal fisheries be updated to at least 5 years or later. 






 
3. Sea level rise due to climate change effect on the project


Has not been resolved. It has been noted by 
at least two member of the Rev Com that sea level rise due to climate 
change is expected; it has been noted that it would be unfair for 
project proponents not to consider this at the onset of the project and 
at the same time to rely on the local government units involved to 
mitigate the effects later when these are already significantly 
affecting prospective locators. The proponents have been required to do a
 modeling on the matter but have only responded with the assurance that 
the Public Estates Authority is now preparing a master plan for all such
 projects in the entire Philippines with precisely this issue in view.












The experts tasked to assess the environmental impact of respondent 
Alltech's Project noted that it was unclear whether the coverage of ECC 
No. CO-9602-002-208C would be expanded. They also acknowledged that all 
prior data may be outdated and would not accurately reflect the expected
 environmental impact of the Project. Despite the presence of these 
important, but unresolved, issues, the Environmental Management Bureau 
issued the Environmental Compliance Certificate. It is baffling how the 
Court of Appeals failed to address these unresolved issues.



Admittedly, environmental cases are highly technical in nature. Courts, 
not having the required expertise, place great weight on the assessments
 of the administrative agencies tasked to assess these issues.



The highly technical nature of the case, however, is no excuse for the Court of Appeals to be remiss in its duty to review 
all

 the evidence presented in a case for the issuance of a writ of 
kalikasan and merely rely on the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources' findings.

 



In 
Cordillera Global Network v. Paje
,
[24]

 this Court had encountered a similar issue. There, the proponent 
submitted an Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan, 
claiming that its prior Environmental Impact Statement had already 
contemplated its tree-cutting proposal:


Private respondents do not deny that they did not apply for a
 new environmental compliance certificate prior to cutting or 
earth-balling the affected trees. Nonetheless, they argue that a 
separate environmental compliance certificate was not needed because 
their amended Environmental Compliance Certificate already covered the 
planned treeÂ­cutting and earth-balling. What was required, they claim, 
was a treeÂ­cutting and/or earth-balling permit, which they secured prior
 to the operations.


Private respondents are mistaken.


In the Environmental Impact Statement, submitted to support private 
respondents' application for an environmental compliance certificate for
 the SM Pines Resort Project, the project's construction phase saw the 
removal "of about 112 trees or 16.54% of the total number of major 
trees" from the proposed building site. Private respondents admitted 
that the removal of these trees will have "[m]edium, negative[,] and 
long term" impact and proposed the following mitigation measures[.]



....


On April 5, 2011, in relation to the application for an amended 
environmental compliance certificate, the Environmental Management 
Bureau-Cordillera Administrative Region requested additional information
 on the trees that would be affected by the Expansion Project[.]





....


Private respondent SM Investments Corporation complied by submitting a 
revised Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan. However, 
while the document contained a detailed inventory of the trees that 
would be affected by the Expansion Project, it did not provide relevant 
information as to whether the trees were planted or naturally grown.


The missing information is crucial to determine if the affected trees 
were part of a natural and residual forest, which means it was "composed
 of indigenous trees, not planted by man[,]" putting them under the 
coverage of Executive Order No. 23, series of 2011.


....



The necessity of a separate environmental compliance certificate is 
evident as the original Environmental Compliance Certificate only 
contemplated the removal of 112 trees for the entire SM Pines Resort 
Project. Meanwhile, the amended Environmental Compliance Certificate 
issued for the Expansion Project considered the environmental impact of 
the "additional parking levels, retail shops[,] and restaurants; and 
construction of a new 1,200 m3/day capacity Sewage Treatment Plant" but 
did not account for removing an additional 182 Benguet pine and Alnus 
trees.




Notably, the plan on the affected trees in the revised Environmental 
Performance Report and Management Plan, in support of the application 
for an amended environmental compliance certificate, seemed to be a mere
 afterthought, as shown by the lack of a solid strategy in place[.]
[25]
 (Citations omitted)



Despite glaring omissions in the proponent's application, this Court in 
Cordillera

 noted that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals had failed to 
notice that a separate Environmental Compliance Certificate was 
necessary, having merely relied on the technical reports submitted by 
the proponent and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources' 
findings on the matter:


It does not escape this Court's attention that both the 
Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals missed private 
respondents' application for the cutting of 182 trees - in addition to 
112 already allowed in the earlier Environmental Compliance Certificate -
 merely through an amended Environmental Compliance Certificate and 
almost nine (9) years after the original had been used. This Court also 
notes the lower court's nonchalant attitude when it failed to notice the
 Department of Environment and Natural Resources failure to distinguish 
indigenous long-standing pine trees from those recently planted when it 
issued	the amended Environmental Compliance Certificate despite the 
existence of Executive Order No. 23.
[26]





In this case, the Environmental Impact Assessment Review Committee 
reported that there were unresolved issues, particularly in the data 
submitted or in the data further required. These alone should have 
alerted the Court of Appeals that despite the barrage of technical 
reports by both parties, the matter required further thoughtful 
assessment, rather than a mere reliance on the Department's 
recommendation.




II



An environmental impact statement was also necessary because there were 
factors that would not have been addressed in the assessment of the 
Amari Coastal Bay Project. Amari Coastal Bay Project's ECC No. 
CO-9602-002-208C provided:




3. The eight-hectare mangrove plantation/research project 
area by the Ecosystems and Research Development Bureau (ERDB) shall be 
maintained and protected as stipulated under the Memorandum of Agreement
 (MOA) between the DENR and the Public Estates Authority (PEA) dated 
December 19, 1991. The reclamation project shall not impede its 
ecological function as breeding place for marine life including 
wildlife. It shall enhance the goal of the Livelihood Plan to ensure 
food security and self-sufficiency.
[27]



This Environmental Compliance Certificate has already recognized parts 
of what would be the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism
 Area. However, certain environmental protection areas had not yet been 
established in 1996, when the Certificate was issued.



The Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area was 
established on April 22, 2007 through Presidential Proclamation No. 
1412,
[28]
 which required that a
 biodiversity impact assessment of such critical habitats "be integrated
 into the Environmental Impact Assessment and the Environmental Risk 
Assessment Processes, taking into consideration guidelines adopted under
 the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity."
[29]
 Presidential Proclamation No. 1412-A
[30]

 further required that "any reclamation in the periphery of the Las 
PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area shall not impede 
the ecological function of the lagoon and its small Islands' mangroves, 
salt marshes and tidal areas as breeding, feeding and roosting place for
 marine and terrestrial wildlife; [and] that "all reclamation in nearby 
areas [must be undertaken] in a way that would help restore and ensure 
shellfish and fish productivity[.]"
[31]



Republic Act No. 11038
[32]
 established the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area as a protected area,
[33]

 or which means "land and/or water set aside by reason of their unique 
physical and biological diversity and protected against destructive 
human exploitation[.]"
[34]



The key phrase here is protection against "destructive human 
exploitation." Thus, while the majority correctly states that nothing in
 the law prohibits reclamation projects adjacent to protected areas,
[35]
 the law explicitly protects these areas against any project that would tend to destroy or exploit them.



DCCD Engineering Corporation (DCCD), a local engineering service 
consultant contracted by respondent Alltech, explicitly stated in its 
report that for the reclamation project to prevent flooding, 4.35 
hectares of the protected habitat be will have to be reclaimed:


If the uniform width of 160 m up to the existing bridge for 
the ParaÃ±aque Channel will be implemented adjacent to the reclamation 
project, no increase in flood levels from the current situation is 
expected. This is consistent with the parameters discussed in Boulevard 
2000. However, if the Habitat will remain thereby constricting the 
channel flow from ParaÃ±aque River, the flood levels will expect to rise 
from 0.23 m to 0.27 m near the river mouth. There may be corresponding 
increase in the inland flooding which may be established by further 
studies. Around 4.35 ha of the Habitat Area will have to be given up if 
the uniform 160 m channel width will be built as planned in Boulevard 
2000.
[36]
 (Citation omitted)



DCCD did propose another alternative later on, in that if the habitat 
would not be reclaimed, garbage from the Manila Coastal Road should 
instead be cleared:


[I]n case of extreme events, no significant difference in 
flood levels between the scenario with the reclamation and the existing 
conditions is expected, if the uniform width of 160 meters up to the 
existing bridge for the ParaÃ±aque channel will be implemented adjacent 
to the reclamation project. The construction of the uniform 160-meter 
channel, however, entails giving up around 4.35 hectares of the Critical
 Habitat. The widening of the existing channel will actually prevent 
flooding. This is because the bird sanctuary/critical habitat constricts
 the channel flow from the ParaÃ±aque River. However, even by excluding 
entirely the Critical Habitat from the reclamation project, the local 
flooding being experienced can still be alleviated by freeing the rivers
 of garbage, debris, silt, informal settlers along the banks and other 
obstructions in the rivers. The street drainage system also needs to be 
improved especially in the low-lying areas where ponding occur. A major 
factor to the local flooding is the Manila Coastal Road, which is a road
 on reclaimed land along the coast and acts as a dike preventing the 
runoff from freely draining towards the bay. The adequacy of the 
culverts and widths of the existing bridges to the bay need to be 
evaluated as well. Forecasts on water elevations at the outlets of the 
Las Pi[Ã±]as-Zapote rivers were generated in case of extreme events.
[37]
 (Citation omitted)






While it is admirable that an alternative was suggested, it was alarming
 for respondent Alltech's own consultants to conclude that "the bird 
sanctuary/critical habitat constrict[ed] the channel flow from the 
ParaÃ±aque River" and would be problematic for respondent Alltech's 
Project.



From these recommendations, it appears that respondent Alltech was being
 given a choice: either undertake the relatively simple task of 
destroying 4.35 hectares of a critical habitat, or the relatively 
difficult task of permanently clearing the Manila Coastal Road of 
garbage, debris, silt, and informal settlers.



The majority insists that this recommendation "is not final and remains a
 proposal and will still be subject to the approval of the government 
through the appropriate agencies."
[38]

 That the proposal was even considered should have already notified the 
Court of Appeals that the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources may not have exercised the proper diligence in issuing the 
Environmental Compliance Certificate.



In any case, if this proposal is not undertaken, flood levels will be 
expected to rise from 0.23 meters to 0.27 meters once the reclamation 
project begins, as the DCCD reported. This was precisely the situation 
that petitioner contemplated. Once the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque Coastal 
Bay Project starts; the reclamation will either destroy 4.35 hectares of
 a protected bird sanctuary or cause flooding to the cities' residents, 
unless respondent Alltech finds a way to permanently clean up Manila 
Coastal Road before construction begins.



Thus, whether or not Republic Act No. 11038 prohibits reclamation 
activities adjacent to or near protected areas, being near the protected
 area should be enough reason to assess their possible effect to that 
protected area.



Courts have always been in a unique position with regard to environmental protection. Our Constitution mandates:


SECTION 16. The State shall protect and advance the right of
 the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the 
rhythm and harmony of nature.
[39]




In line with this, this Court promulgated the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases,
[40]
 which provides for the issuance of the extraordinary writ of kalikasan.
[41]

 However, as the majority pointed out, the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque 
Coastal Bay Project has not yet begun construction. The Environmental 
Compliance Certificate's issuance does not mean approval to begin the 
reclamation project. There is, therefore, no evidence yet of imminent 
environmental damage that may be the subject of a writ of kalikasan.



There are, however, features of the Project that may need further study 
and approval. Thus, I recommend that this Court instead issue a 
temporary environmental protection order
[42]

 to enjoin any act that may cause grave and irreparable injury to the 
protected area and to the residents of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque, and to 
monitor any such acts once the Project has been commenced.




ACCORDINGLY
, I vote: (1) to

SECTION 8. Issuance of Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO). -
 If it appears from the verified complaint with a prayer for the 
issuance of an Environmental Protection Order (EPO) that the matter is 
of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave injustice and 
irreparable injury, the executive judge of the multiple-sala court 
before raffle or the presiding judge of a single-sala court as the case 
may be, may issue ex parte a TEPO effective for only seventy-two (72) 
hours from date of the receipt of the TEPO by the party or person 
enjoined. Within said period, the court where the case is assigned, 
shall conduct a summary hearing to determine whether the TEPO may be 
extended until the termination of the case.




The court where the case is assigned, shall periodically monitor the 
existence of acts that are the subject matter of the TEPO even if issued
 by the executive judge, and may lift the same at any time as 
circumstances may warrant.


The applicant shall be exempted from the posting of a bond for the issuance of a TEPO.


Section 9. Action on motion for dissolution of TEPO. - The grounds for 
motion to dissolve a TEPO shall be supported by affidavits of the party 
or person enjoined which the applicant may oppose, also by affidavits.


The TEPO may be dissolved if it appears after hearing that its issuance 
or continuance would cause irreparable damage to the party or person 
enjoined while the applicant may be fully compensated for such damages 
as he may stiffer and subject to the posting of a sufficient bond by the
 party or person enjoined.




CONCURRING OPINION


CAGUIOA, J.:



The 
ponencia
 dismisses the petition for review on 
certiorari

 (the petition) filed by petitioner Cynthia Villar (petitioner) and 
affirms the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA), which 
denied the issuance of the privilege of the writ of 
kalikasan
 
against the implementation of the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay 
Project (proposed project) by respondent Alltech Contractors, Inc. 
(Alltech).





I concur with the 
ponencia
. I write this Opinion to further elucidate on certain points raised by petitioner as well as by my esteemed colleagues.






Preliminary matters on the writ of kalikasan


 







The writ of 
kalikasan
 is categorized as a special civil action 
and conceptualized as an extraordinary remedy. It covers environmental 
damage of such magnitude that will prejudice the life, health, or 
property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces, and is 
available against an unlawful act or omission of a public official or 
employee, or private individual or entity.
[1]

 Thus, to successfully avail of this remedy, the following requisites 
must be present: (1) there is an actual or threatened violation of the 
constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology; (2) the actual
 or threatened violation arises from an unlawful act or omission of a 
public official or employee, or private individual or entity; and (3) 
the actual or threatened violation involves or will lead to an 
environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health 
or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.
[2]
 Petitioner bears the burden of substantiating these elements.



In the instant case, petitioner harps on the alleged irregularities in 
the process of the issuance by the Department of Environment and Natural
 Resources - Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB) of the 
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) for the proposed project on 
the basis of an Environmental Performance Report Management Plan 
(EPRMP). According to petitioner, the correct mode of Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) for the proposed project is an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS), not an EPRMP.



In this regard, the 
ponencia
 correctly points out that, as a 
rule, any of the perceived irregularities in the issuance of the 
proposed project's ECC should be the subject of an appeal to the proper 
reviewing authority instead of a petition for writ of 
kalikasan
. Indeed, a writ of 
kalikasan

 cannot be used as a substitute for other remedies that are available to
 the parties, whether legal, administrative, or political. Mere concern 
for the environment is not an excuse to invoke this Court's jurisdiction
 in cases where other remedies are available.
[3]



Nevertheless, the Court, in 
Paje v. CasiÃ±o
[4]
 (
Paje
),
 recognized that a party who invokes the writ based on alleged defects 
or irregularities in the issuance of an ECC may do so, provided that 
such party not only alleges and proves such defects or irregularities, 
but also provides a causal link or, at least, a reasonable connection 
between the defects or irregularities in the issuance of the ECC and the
 actual or threatened violation of the constitutional right to a 
balanced and healthful ecology of the magnitude contemplated under the 
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases (the Rules). Failing in this 
regard, the petition should be dismissed outright so that it may be 
filed before the proper forum in accord with the doctrine of exhaustion 
of administrative remedies. Such course of action is necessitated by the
 need to preserve the noble and laudable purposes of the writ against 
those who seek to abuse it.
[5]





According to 
Paje
, an example of a defect or an irregularity in 
the issuance of an ECC which could conceivably warrant the granting of 
the extraordinary remedy of the writ of 
kalikasan is




a case where there are serious and substantial 
misrepresentations or fraud in the application for the ECC, which, if 
not immediately nullified, would cause actual negative environmental 
impacts of the magnitude contemplated under the Rules, because the 
government agencies and LGUs, with the final authority to implement the 
project, may subsequently rely on such substantially defective or 
fraudulent ECC in approving the implementation of the project.
[6]


The Court, in 
Paje
, also liberally applied this principle and 
considered the allegation that there was no EIA conducted relative to 
the amendments of the ECC therein as one that can be reasonably 
connected to an environmental damage of the magnitude contemplated under
 the Rules.



The circumstances in 
Paje
 are absent in the instant case. 
Petitioner miserably failed to show a causal link, or at least a 
reasonable connection, between the alleged defects or irregularities in 
the issuance of the ECC here in question and the actual or threatened 
violation of the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful 
ecology of the magnitude contemplated under the Rules. For this reason 
alone, the petition should have already been dismissed for failure to 
exhaust administrative remedies. Nevertheless, even if the Court were to
 disregard this procedural infirmity, the petition should still be 
denied.






On the proper form of Environmental Impact Assessment for the proposed project


 







The 
ponencia
 comprehensively discusses how Alltech submitted the 
proper form of EIA required for the proposed project. In sum, when the 
DENR-EMB required an EPRMP for the proposed project, it took into 
consideration the fact that the application was premised on the 1996 ECC
 of the discontinued Philippine Estates Authority (PEA) - Amari Coastal 
Bay Development Corporation (Amari) project. This is in full accord with
 DENR Administrative Order No. 30, Series of 2003 (DAO 03-30) and its 
Revised Procedural Manual, which provides that an EPRMP is the required 
EIA document type "for operating projects with previous ECCs but 
planning or applying for clearance to modify/expand or 
re-start
 operations x x x."



Associate Justices Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen) and Amy C. 
Lazaro-Javier (Justice Javier) echo the argument of petitioner that the 
EPRMP is not the proper fonn of EIA for the proposed project considering
 that the PEA-Amari project covered by the 1996 ECC was never 
implemented. They opine that Alltech should have submitted an EIS, which
 is the applicable EIA form for new environmentally critical projects. 
This has already been sufficiently rebutted by the 
ponencia
. Specifically, the 
ponencia

 notes that the PEA-Amari project was partially implemented, with 157.84
 hectares of the 750-hectare project already reclaimed. As explained by 
the DENR:




The subject coastal bay project cannot be simply considered 
as an entirely new project since the latter logically presuppose[s] the 
absence of any kind of existing environn1ental data at all. 
In other 
words, the above engineering and associated works already undertaken in 
the area generate cumulative environmental data which can serve as basis
 for the submission of an EPRMP.
 x x x


The PEA-Amari project had already been implemented and began operations 
as shown by the earth moving activities undertaken thereon. 
The 
activities conducted under the old ECC have actual cumulative 
environmental impact and data which can be used as basis in determining 
the effectiveness of the applicable measures implemented under the old 
ECC, in relation to the current coastal bay project.
[7]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Thus, considering that the PEA-Amari project which was covered by the 
1996 ECC had already been implemented and the entire area of the 
proposed project of Alltech falls within the area of the previous ECC 
issued in favor of Amari, then the EPRMP was the correct form of EIA 
report applied in acquiring the ECC.



Justice Leonen underscores that the ECC was issued despite the fact that
 certain issues, concerns, and problems raised in the Comments and 
Chairman's Report (Report) of the EIA Review Committee (EIARC) were 
allegedly unresolved. Said Report noted that it was unclear whether the 
coverage of the ECC issued in favor of Amari would be expanded, and it 
also acknowledged that prior data may be outdated and would not 
accurately reflect the expected environmental impact of the proposed 
project. According to Justice Leonen, these unresolved issues should 
have placed the CA on guard as to the scope of review undertaken.
[8]





With due respect, I disagree. A careful examination of the records would
 show that these issues were all already resolved. As explained by the 
DENR:


x x x The statement in the Chairman's Report that there is 
an "issue as to whether the application [is] for an expansion coverage 
of the earlier ECC or for a new ECC" 
was only made to point out that 
this matter was among those considered by the EIARC and the EMB during 
the initial stages of the EIA process, and which were 
eventually resolved
 upon the issuance by the EMB of the EPRMP checklist
.
 Thus, in the same paragraph, [the EIARC Chair] stated that all the 
shortcomings and issues are capable of being resolved and that the 
EIARC recommends the issuance of the ECC with conditions to be specified
.
[9]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)



On the propriety of an EPRMP, petitioner claims that an EPRMP is 
stripped of the critical and essential features of a full-fledged EIS 
such as: the scoping of the technical, environmental, and social issues 
that must be addressed; gathering of baseline environmental conditions; 
impact assessment focused on significant environmental impacts taking 
into account cumulative impacts; proof of consultation with 
stakeholders; and mandatory public hearings.
[10]

 According to petitioner, the EPRMP looks backward and is heavily 
reliant on secondary sets of data which are more than a decade old and 
thus irrelevant and unresponsive to present realities. Petitioner claims
 that "[i]nstead of scoping forward for possible important issues based 
on present and projected realities through an EIS, a diluted and 
conservative version of the EIA study 
via
 an EPRMP was submitted and used as basis for the issuance of a new ECC."
[11]





Petitioner's attempt to downplay the effectiveness and comprehensiveness
 of an EPRMP - as compared to an EIS - is erroneous and inaccurate. In 
Paje
,
 the Court explained that the EIA process is a system, not a set of 
rigid rules and definitions - there is much room for flexibility in the 
determination and use of the appropriate EIA document type.
[12]

 Hence, the Court ruled that what should be controlling is the guiding 
principle set in DAO 03-30 in the evaluation of applications for 
amendments to ECCs, as stated in Section 8.3 thereof: "[r]equirements 
for processing ECC amendments shall depend on the 
nature of the request
 but shall be focused on the 
information necessary
 to assess the environmental impact of such changes."
[13]

 Consequently, as applied herein, the next logical question is: Did the 
EPRMP provide the necessary information in order for the DENR-EMB to 
assess the environmental impact of the proposed project of Alltech? The 
answer is in the affirmative.





The EIA process conducted by the EMB should not be characterized as an 
incomplete or limited study by the mere reasoning that an EPRMP was 
used. Professor Agerico M. De Villa (Prof. De Villa), Chairman of the 
EIARC, explained that by the submission of an EPRMP, it does not 
necessarily follow that the EIARC may no longer impose additional 
requirements for the ECC application. Thus, the EIARC may deem it 
necessary to add more parameters on top of the old, technical EIS to be 
incorporated to the EPRMP. Here, according to Prof. De Villa, the EIARC 
actually imposed a more thorough and in-depth environmental analysis 
which yielded an even more comprehensive study compared to the previous 
PEA-Amari EIS, as evidenced by the volume of data incorporated in the 
final EPRMP, while focusing on the more important issues such as 
flooding, the critical habitat, and the fisherfolk. In fact, Prof. De 
Villa testified that the EIARC actually treated the subject ECC 
application as if it were a technical EIS:








Q


 
My question: since it was an 
EPRMP checklist and you just explained to us that it is more simplified 
as to focus, my question is x x x: how can you say that any review that 
you would conduct based on this is sufficient in support [of] the 
issuance of an ECC by the review committee?






A


 
One, 
if you are using an EPRMP, it does not necessarily follow that you cannot add requirements to it
, except for the requirement of social impact assessment. In other words, 
if
 the review committee deems it necessary to add more parameters coming 
from the old, technical EIS to be added to the EPRMP, we can do that, 
which we have done
. In fact, 
in this case[,] because we
 have done that, if you will notice the EPRMP is much more thicker than 
the original EIS and there is no limit as to what we will require
 so long as we do not require public consultation or public hearing, so 
in our case so far as we are concerned, being the chair, I actually treated it as if it were a technical EIS
.














Q 


Why do you say so?






A


 
(1) because we were able to add 
considerations that would have been part only of the technical EIS but 
now we required them of the EPRMP; (2) I have been able to convince the 
proponent x x x to have at least public consultation x x x.














Q


 You mentioned you took into consideration 
[matters that are] appropriate only for a technical EIS. What are those 
matters that you took into consideration?






A


 
Well, for example, 
when you have 
EPRMP, that means you have to focus more on what you think are the most 
important issues of the project; and given our assessment, we focused 
on, for example: flooding, for example: the critical habitat, for 
example: the plight of the fisherfolk who were the residents within the 
site itself
 x x x and focusing on these for example in the case
 of flooding we required more data, but they furnished data from 
[PAGASA], which did not satisfy us, because you cannot make predictions 
on micro term even the data they have submitted to us. 
So we 
require[d from] them additional information rather than waiting for all 
the statistics involved, we simply presumed that flooding would be [very
 important and vital for the project and therefore,] focusing on it[,] 
we required [that the] management plan must be compatible with Manila 
Bay guidelines [on] critical habitat management plan [and] with 
Boulevard 2000 plan - all of which also have to be compatible with the 
R.A.s [involved,] for example [C]lean [A]ir [Act, [C]lean [W]ater [A]ct,
 and the [B]uilding [C]ode. And so on and so forth.
[14]
 (Emphasis supplied)







Additionally, as pointed out by the CA, Alltech was even required to 
meet a higher standard through the EPRMP, which is to preserve the 
environmental condition in the vicinity of the proposed project using as
 basis the higher quality of environment in 1990.
[15]
 In explaining his preference for the EPRMP over the EIS, Prof. De Villa testified that:


[i]n 1990 compared to fairly recently, the environmental 
quality of the cited vicinity was better, and therefore if that would be
 the basis for the management of the environment, then, that means you 
have a higher quality of environment that the proponent have (sic) to 
keep. In other words, through time, whether we like it or not, our 
environment degrades, 
so what I am saying precisely because EPRMP is 
used, therefore the proponents have to keep their promise to keep the 
quality of environment x x x as of 1990
 x x x.
[16]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Thus, contrary to the claim of petitioner that the EPRMP "looks backward"
[17]
 and is "not responsive to present realities,"
[18]

 the EPRMP actually ensures that the proponent will protect the 
environment according to the optimum standard. As assured by the DENR, 
the proponents are not only required to maintain the contemporary 
environmental conditions during the implementation of the project, they 
are likewise bound to improve the same consistent with the standards in 
1996.
[19]



Evidently, the foregoing considerations show that not only was the EPRMP
 the correct form of EIA study required based on the nature of the 
proposed project, it was also sufficient in assessing the environmental 
impact of the proposed project.








On the DENR's determination of the proper EIA form for the proposed project


 







It should be emphasized that it was the DENR-EMB that instructed Alltech to submit an EPRMP.
[20]
 In this regard, the 
ponencia
 states:


In the present case, no grave abuse of discretion was proven
 to be attributed to the DENR-EMB in instructing the project proponent 
to file an EPRMP. Hence, it enjoys the presumption of regularity in the 
performance of its official duties. Based on its technical expertise, it
 found that the information provided in an EPRMP sufficiently addressed 
the environmental concerns of the government.


It is within the DENR-EMB's function and expertise to determine the 
category or classification of a proposed project as it is equipped with 
the knowledge and competence to resolve issues involving the highly 
technical field of EIS system. Alltech merely complied with the 
instruction of the DENR-EMB to submit an EPRMP. The project proponent 
should not be faulted for this as it is not in the position to 
substitute the assessment or technical opinion of the DENR-EMB with its 
own judgment. It is within the sphere of technical knowledge and 
expertise of the DENR-EMB, and not the Court nor the project proponent, 
to determine the appropriate EIA report to submit for a particular 
project.
[21]



I agree with the foregoing pronouncements. The adamant insistence on the
 "correct" type of EIA study, in the absence of any allegation of grave 
abuse of discretion on the part of the DENR-EMB, and without any 
technical and scientific expertise to support such claim, simply cannot 
be countenanced. As the administrative agency entrusted with the 
determination as to which EIA document type applies to a particular 
application for ECC, falling as it does within its particular technical 
expertise, it is the DENR's determination, especially in the absence of a
 showing of grave abuse of discretion or patent irregularity, that 
should be accorded great respect by the Court. Indeed, this is the 
demand of the doctrine of separation of powers, which behooves the Court
 from interfering in matters addressed to the sound discretion of 
executive agencies with special competence unless there is a showing of 
grave abuse of discretion in the performance of their duties.






On the recommendation for the issuance of a Temporary Environmental Protection Order


 







For his part, Justice Leonen votes to issue a Temporary Environmental 
Protection Order (TEPO) to enjoin respondents from doing any act that 
may cause grave and irreparable injury to the Las PiÃ±asÂ­ParaÃ±aque 
Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA). He explains:


[T]his Court promulgated the Rules of Procedure for 
Environmental Cases, which provides for the issuance of the 
extraordinary writ of kalikasan. However, as the majority pointed out, 
the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project has not yet begun 
construction. The Environmental Compliance Certificate's issuance does 
not mean approval to begin the reclamation project. There is, therefore,
 no evidence yet of imminent environmental damage that may be the 
subject of a writ of kalikasan.


There are, however, features of the Project which may need further study
 and approval. Thus, I recommend that this Court instead issue a 
[T]emporary [E]nvironmental [P]rotection [O]rder to enjoin any act that 
may cause grave and irreparable injury to the protected area and to the 
residents of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque, and to monitor any such acts once 
the Project has been commenced.
[22]



With due respect to my colleague, I believe that a TEPO may be unnecessary or superfluous.



Lest it be forgotten, the ECC is a planning tool - its mere issuance 
does not automatically signal the actual implementation of the proposed 
project. It is still necessary that the requirements and conditions 
imposed therein are complied with. The following averments from the DENR
 are thus compelling:


x x x 
[T]he release of the ECC only allows the project to
 proceed to the next stage of project planning, which is the acquisition
 of approvals from other government agencies and LGUs.
 Aside from the acquisition of these approvals, 
the proponents must also comply with the conditions and undertakings in the ECC and EPRMP
.
 To name a few, these include the implementation of a Coastal Ecosystem 
Management Plan/Program, Information, Education and Communication 
Program, Flood Monitoring Plan, and alignment of the Environmental 
Management Plan with the Manila Bay Coastal Strategy. x x x


x x x x


Moreover, the ECC demands compliance with
 the Toxic Substances 
and Hazardous and Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990, Ecological Solid 
Waste Management Program Act of 2000, the Philippine Clear Water Act of 
2004, and the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999, 
among other environmental laws and regulations
.
 Further, the ECC requires proper storm drainage system, concrete 
culverts, and other t1ood and erosion control [measures], noise and air 
pollution control measures to prevent environmental degradation.


Without any doubt, 
the absence of compliance with the above 
conditions and undertakings, aside from those contained in the EPRMP, 
prevent the actual implementation of the coastal bay project. Also, the 
absence of the above plans and programs which are intended to direct the
 course of the project implementation renders the contention of 
petitioner as absurd
. As a planning tool, the ECC cmmot embody the 
"specific details" for the implementation of the project, inasmuch as 
the post-conditions thereto, that will form part of the specific 
commitments of the proponents, are yet to be formulated by the concerned
 government agencies and institutions.


x x x x


For the critical habitat alone [or the LPPCHEA], the proponents are 
mandated to coordinate with the Manila Bay Critical Habitat Management 
Council and the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB) to tackle 
impacts of the project on the critical habitat, and implement the 
recommendations of the said council.
 Thus, the project implementation cannot proceed without said recommendations.


Parenthetically, 
the recommendation of both the Manila Bay Critical 
Habitat Management Council and the PAWB must be implemented before any 
work or construction activities may be made, especially those affecting 
the critical habitat
. Again, this condition seems to have been 
ignored by petitioner in claiming that the adoption of the Boulevard 
2000 Framework Plan would destroy the ecosystems found in the critical 
habitat. Considering the ECC-required recommendations from the Manila 
Bay Critical Habitat Management Council and the PAWB, observance of the 
Boulevard 2000 Framework Plan cannot be made in its totality without 
endangering the critical habitat.
[23]
 (Emphasis supplied)



It is evident therefore that before the proposed project can be 
implemented, Alltech must show compliance not only with the conditions 
in the EPRMP and ECC, but also with a plethora of environmental laws and
 regulations, and obtain the necessary permits from various government 
agencies tasked with protecting the environment. Thus, the prevention of
 grave and irreparable injury to the LPPCHEA and the residents of Las 
PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque may already be covered by these requirements prior 
to implementation. This therefore negates any need to issue a TEPO.



At this juncture, I wish to emphasize that respondents have shown that 
mitigating measures will be undertaken in particular regard to the 
LPPCHEA. Notably, unlike in the PEA-Amari project which included the 
LPPCHEA itself, Alltech's proposed project actually excludes the LPPCHEA
 from its coverage to ensure that it is not adversely impacted.
[24]

 Despite the fact that the LPPCHEA area is already outside of the 
proposed project, the respondents have nonetheless recognized the 
vulnerability of the LPPCHEA and have vowed to undertake mitigating 
measures to ensure that the proposed project will not have any negative 
impact on the LPPCHEA. Indeed, respondents have considered measures that
 not only preserve the LPPCHEA, but improve its condition:


78. To recall, the DENR Vulnerability Report, which 
Petitioner cites in her Petition, states that an estimated 572.76 kilos 
of garbage are being thrown in the LPPCHEA everyday.


79. The LPPCHEA is expected to deteriorate further if no active intervention is put in place to improve the current situation. 
As
 adequately shown by ALLTECH during trial, the mitigation measures 
adopted by the Project proponents, not to mention the onerous conditions
 stated in the ECC, ensure that the Project will move towards the 
direction of environmental protection. Given all these, Petitioner's 
insistence to leave LPPCHEA as it is and let it further degrade is 
certainly absurd and irrational.


80. All told, the project masterplan has been formulated to allow the 
development works to co-exist with the LPPCHEA, with the latter serving 
as an eco-park/eco-tourism area. A vibrant and well-preserved LPPCHEA 
is, therefore, integral to the success of the Project.

On the nature of a reclamation project and its effects on the environment


 







As regards the effects of the proposed project on the environment, Justice Javier opines:


Verily, the question is not "whether actual environmental 
damage will occur" anymore, but how much more damage will it cause, for 
it has consistently been found and proven that reclamation had actually 
and already caused environmental damage. In fact, it is not only the 
aforementioned areas that will be exposed to flooding and inundation, 
but also the very reclaimed lands themselves.






For another, the reclamation projects x x x and the eventual 
construction of road networks and bridges will more likely than not 
cause direct negative impacts upon the [LPPCHEA]. x x x


x x x x


Hence, even respondents' evidence confirmed the conclusion of the Court 
of Appeals that "the threat of flooding as a consequence of land 
reclamation is conceded and thus the causal link between the human 
activity of reclamation and environmental threat of flooding is 
established."


Worse, respondents' position rests on the premise that the recommended 
mitigating measures being in place would purportedly prevent or "would 
not aggravate" the flooding situations and "even reduce the level of 
flooding." [Geological expert Kelvin S. Rodolfo], however, remains 
unconvinced and unimpressed by such measures for being historically 
ineffective and even aggravating x x x.


x x x x


Clearly, respondents' confidence is misplaced. Short of any certainty, 
the promise of safety is but ideal and theoretical. In effect, 
respondents, again, have clearly acknowledged, nay, admitted that the 
proposed reclamation would cause environmental impacts.
[26]
 (Emphasis omitted)


I disagree. With due respect, these statements do not paint the entire picture.



The need for extreme caution in examining the possible negative effects 
of reclamation projects on the environment is understandable and 
laudable. Nonetheless, the Court should not operate on the premise that 
reclamation in itself is harmful to the environment. Notably, 
reclamation is not prohibited by our environmental laws. Rather, what 
the laws provide are ways to regulate reclamation projects in such a way
 as to mitigate or prevent altogether any negative impact these may have
 on the environment.





Thus, while reclamation activities may have negative impacts on the 
environment, the same will only arise if mitigating measures are not put
 in place to address these possible effects. On this note, the Court 
cannot simply brush aside the proposed mitigating measures of the 
experts and prematurely claim that these would not be met. The Court 
does not rule on surmises, speculations, and generalizations. Otherwise,
 to base our ruling on mere suppositions would stymie any reclamation 
project that would be proposed, regardless of its compliance with the 
requirements of law. This would be tantamount to saying, in simple 
terms, that all reclamation projects are bad for the environment. As for
 the credence of such belief, it is not for the Court to determine. What
 the Court is called to do is to ensure compliance with the laws. On 
this note, the following averments of the DENR are enlightening:


The process of reclamation 
per se
 does not result to flooding or significant environmental damage
 contrary to petitioner's baseless conclusions.


Petitioner's assertion that "aggravated flooding as a direct result of a
 reclamation project is conceded fact, rendering any discussion thereon 
unnecessary" is literally 
taken out of context
. To be clear, 
the Court of Appeals' declaration that "the threat of flooding as a consequence of land reclamation is conceded" has been 
qualified

 by the conclusion that "the extent and magnitude of this threat have 
been scientifically determined and quantified and they do not amount at 
all to any such massive flooding nor to any such destruction of the 
critical habitat LPPCHEA asserted by the petitioner."
 x x x


x x x x


Indeed, the mere introduction of works upon the environment, by 
themselves, cannot cause significant threat, damage or destruction 
thereon. Activities which may affect the environment such as mining, 
cutting of trees, land development and urban expansion (which may 
aggravate global warming) are not proscribed provided that scientific 
studies or environmental assessments have been made to identify the 
potential risks and measures which may be taken to address the same.




These include 
reclamation activities which do not necessarily result 
to massive flooding or significant environmental damage as long as 
scientific studies have been conducted and the needed measures to 
address the potential risks are observed during the implementation of 
the project. 
The recurring floods in Metro Manila are not caused by reclamation activities
; instead, these are caused by the proliferation of garbage, human recklessness and poor engineering, among others.


On the other hand, the vast portions of the Coastal Bay Area, along the 
stretch of Roxas Boulevard, are reclaimed lands which, by themselves, do
 not bring about flooding to the nearby areas. 
Well[-]designed and
 properly executed reclamation projects will not cause flooding. In 
fact, these projects can prevent flooding by providing added protection 
such as sea barriers to mitigate the effects of accelerated rising sea 
levels caused by global warming.
[27]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)



The Court, which clearly has no expertise in these matters, should give 
credence and defer to these findings by the DENR. While the Court has 
jurisdiction and power to decide cases, it clearly oversteps its 
boundaries by not giving proper respect to the findings and 
recommendations of the administrative agency on questions that demand 
the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special 
knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative tribunal to 
deten11ine technical and intricate matters of fact.
[28]








 


In sum, considering that the laws do not categorically prohibit 
reclamation activities, it becomes a matter of evidence whether such 
activities would cause damage to the environment of such magnitude as to
 prejudice the life, health, or property of inhabitants in two or more 
cities or provinces so as to enable the issuance of the privilege of the
 writ of 
kalikasan
. However, as found by the CA after an exhaustive study of the evidence presented before it, which is affirmed by the 
ponencia
,
 petitioner simply failed to present credible, competent, and reliable 
evidence to support her allegations. Moreover, petitioner's 
apprehensions on the negative impacts of the proposed project on the 
environment have been disproved by objective, expert, and scientific 
studies of reputable entities with vast international experience.


Final Note



The DAO 03-30 lays down the basic policy and operating principles of the
 government in evaluating the impacts of proposed projects on the 
environment. It provides that consistent with the principles of 
sustainable development, the policy of the State in environmental impact
 assessments is to "ensure a rational balance between socio-economic 
development and environmental protection for the benefit of present and 
future generations"
[29]
 and to
 "[assess] the direct and indirect impacts of a project on the 
biophysical and human environment and [ensure] that these impacts are 
addressed by appropriate environmental protection and enhancement."
[30]



Thus, it is important to strike a delicate balance between protecting 
the environment and promoting socio-economic development, both of which 
are for the benefit of present and future generations. This balancing 
act is reflected in the following statement of the City of Las PiÃ±as as 
contained in its Comment, which was adopted by the City of ParaÃ±aque:


27. Essentially, local revenue multipliers will arise from 
tourism that would be expected with the improvement of conditions in the
 LPPCHEA and expansion of residential and commercial establishments 
after completion. These sprang from the common knowledge that Las 
[PiÃ±as] City is the fourth most populated but has the fifth lowest 
income in the National Capital Region. 
The City should not be restrained from pursuing a legitimate project that aims to spur its socio-economic development.


28. 
But more importantly, on top of it all, Respondent City of Las 
[PiÃ±as] will certainly not allow to be the cause of environmental damage
 and dangerous flooding.
 In pursuing the project, it has directed 
the adoption of concrete measures to protect the LPPCHEA and improve 
Hooding conditions. The City of Las [PiÃ±as] has insisted on thorough 
research and studies to avoid any tragedy that may befall its 
environment and citizenry. Given the foregoing, it would be a dangerous 
precedent to allow the instant Petition supported merely by bare 
allegation and suspicion. To do so would be the real tragedy in that 
sense.
[31]
 (Emphasis supplied)



The writ of 
kalikasan
 is among the mechanisms by which the Court 
takes a proactive role in ensuring that the constitutional right of the 
people to a balanced and healthful ecology may be advanced and 
protected.
[32]
 However, being 
proactive does not mean that the Court may arrogate unto itself the 
determination of intricacies that are far beyond its capacity by 
insisting on generalized and incomplete assumptions and specious 
speculations when there is strong scientific evidence to the contrary. 
In the absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DENR, the
 Court must avoid the urge to supplant its own perceived superiority 
over administrative agencies which are not only given the specific task 
and competence by the law, but are also far more knowledgeable on the 
technicalities involving environmental matters.



Parties who seek the issuance of the writ of 
kalikasan
, whether on their own or on others' behalf, carry the burden of substantiating the writ's elements.
[33]

 In this case, petitioner failed to satisfy the burden to prove her 
claims. Based on a careful and meticulous weighing of the evidence 
presented by the parties, the CA gave more weight to respondent's 
evidence:




Petitioner Villar may have been motivated by good faith x x x. 
Unfortunately,
 the ones that she commissioned failed to conduct a thorough, rigorous 
and objective study on the possible impacts of the proposed reclamation 
project.
 The studies made by Tricore and CEC-P were 
not comprehensive and the methodologies applied were inappropriate
. There was also 
lack of expertise

 on the part of Tricore and CEC-P in the areas of hydrology and 
hydraulics, which areas are pertinent in the conduct of their respective
 studies. Thus, petitioner Villar failed to support her claim by any 
competent, credible and reliable evidence that the proposed reclamation 
project will expose her and the Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque residents and 
their properties to catastrophic environmental damage.


On the other hand, Alltech and the other respondents were able to 
establish the scientific and expert studies [that] assessed the 
potential flooding and flushing impact that may arise from the coastal 
bay project.
 The expert, objective studies conducted by DCCD, Surbana and DHI, 
revealed that if all the recommended mitigating measures were to be implemented
, the [c]oastal bay project 
would not aggravate the flooding situation
 in the river mouths of ParaÃ±aque, Las PiÃ±as-Zapote Rivers, and it 
may even reduce the level of flooding
.
[34]
 (Emphasis supplied)



To reiterate, petitioner failed to present credible, competent, and 
reliable evidence to support her allegations. Moreover, petitioner's 
apprehensions on the negative impacts of the proposed project on the 
environment have been disproved by objective, expert, and scientific 
studies of reputable entities with vast international experience. 
Consequently, petitioner failed to prove her entitlement to the 
privilege of the writ of 
kalikasan

DISSENTING OPINION


LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:



I respectfully dissent and vote to partially grant the petition.


Paje v. CasiÃ±o
[1]

 has held that a petition for the privilege of the writ of kalikasan 
addresses (i) whether the alleged defects or irregularities in the 
issuance of an environmental compliance certificate have a causal link 
or at least a 
reasonable connection
 to the 
actual or threatened grave violation

 of the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology in 
terms of the territorial scope of such damage; and (ii) whether 
actual environmental damage will occur
 if the project is implemented.






Whether the defects or
 irregularities in the issuance of an environmental compliance 
certificate have a causal link or at least a reasonable connection to 
the actual or threatened grave violation of the constitutional right to a
 balanced and healthful ecology in terms of the territorial scope of 
such damage


 






Paje
 has recognized that 
the use of a wrong environmental impact assessment document type
 is a defect or irregularity in the issuance of an environmental compliance certificate that has a 
causal link
 or at least a reasonable connection to the 
environmental damage of a magnitude that transcends political and territorial boundaries
. This is because a wrong document type results in an 
erroneous environmental impact assessment and flawed environmental compliance certificate
,
 which government agencies and local governments, with final authority 
to implement the project, in turn, incorrectly rely upon in approving 
the implementation of the project.


Here, respondents used the wrong environmental impact assessment document type.
 According to 
Paje
, an Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan (EPRMP) is used in the following instances:


Expansion of existing projects (including undertakings that have 
stopped operations for more than 5 years and plan to re-start with or 
without expansion);


Operating projects without ECCs;


Operating projects with previous ECCs but planning or applying for clearance to modify/expand or re-start operations;


Existing projects for modification or re-start up; and,


Single, non-implemented project applying for a major amendment of its ECC.



The Las PiÃ±as Coastal Bay Project and the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project are 
new projects
. Hence, as held in 
Paje
, each of these projects requires an environmental impact statement. These projects cannot use an 
EPRMP
 because neither of them is an operating or existing project.


They cannot be tacked with the PEA-Amari Coastal Bay project because 
this project never took off as its ECC expired five (5) years from the 
date of its issuance.
 This was because the governing legal structure for the projects, 
the
 Amended Joint Venture Agreement between the Public Estates Authority 
(PEA) and the Amari Coastal Bay Development Corporation, was nullified 
by the Court in 2002
.



The Las PiÃ±as Coastal Bay Project and the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project are 
not non-implemented projects
 applying for major amendments of their ECCs.



Indeed, it is 
counterintuitive
 to insist upon an EPRMP as the 
environmental impact assessment document type for the Las PiÃ±as Coastal 
Bay Project and the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project when there is no 
ongoing or existing project, and the PEA-Amari Coastal Bay project 
they seek to ride on
 was 
based on environmental assessment and data dating back to 1996
.
 The EPRMP is appropriate for ongoing and existing projects or 
non-implemented projects seeking to amend substantially their ECCs 
because, as clearly explained by petitioner:


138. The rationale behind requiring only an EPRMP for 
projects that have operated initially is to dispense with needless 
submissions of new studies as there presumably exists a number of useful
 data about the actual environmental impacts of a project 
as observed
. Of course, there is no need to duplicate the tedious processes of an 
Environmental Impact Statement
 when the effects of a project have been 
recorded
 upon its implementation and where historical environmental performance 
and status of the project and its management plan are already known
.


139. Given a project that had operated but stopped for a period of more 
than five (5) years, what is required is an environmental impact report 
on how well the mitigation and enhancement measures worked, using its 
environmental management plan ("EMP") as a yardstick. The convenience of
 preparing an EPRMP leaves the proponent to focus on ways to enact 
improvements on a project that has been implemented and has operated 
with plans for modification, expansion or a restart. This shortcut 
allows the proponent to suggest modifications and changes in the 
original plan to augment environmental performance without the costly 
distraction of undertaking a comprehensive environmental impact 
statement study.
[2]


140. Being a documentation of the 
actual cumulative environmental impacts and effectiveness of current measure for single projects
,
 basic logic dictates that there has to be a project that had physically
 come onto fruition and had actually become operational. For, otherwise,
 there is no source from which a report can be made on such a single 
project.
[3]


One must not confuse an EPRMP with an Environmental Impact Statement, or conflate one with the other.
 The reason, according to 
Paje
, is that:


The appropriate EIA document type vis-a-vis a particular 
project depends on the potential significant environmental impact of the
 project. At the highest level would be an ECP, such as the subject 
project. 
The hierarchy of EIA document type, based on comprehensiveness and detail of the study or report contained therein
, insofar as single projects are concerned, is as follows:


1. Environmental Impact Statement (EIS),

2. Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Report,

3. Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Checklist Report,

4. 
Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan (EPRMP)
, and

5. Project Description 170 (PD) or Project Description Report (PDR).
[4]



It was 
therefore speculative
 for the Court of Appeals to have 
based the environmental soundness of the Las PiÃ±as Coastal Bay Project 
and the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project upon an 
EPRMP
 and to have 
concluded that conducting an EPRMP would not have made any difference

 from an environmental impact assessment, since these environmental 
assessment document types are distinct varieties of studies in both 
processes, requirements, and in all likelihood, findings. 
Otherwise
, the wise bureaucrats in charge of environmental protection in the country would 
not have required an EPRMP in distinct circumstances and an environmental impact assessment in others
.



To be clear, I am not saying that the ECC is an outright permit to 
operate, but it is, nonetheless, a necessary step in the process of 
acquiring such permit. Here, since Alltech did not submit the correct 
environmental impact assessment document type, the ECC issued to it is 
incipiently and irreparably defective, hence, should be revoked at once.
 For government agencies and local governments should not be misled into
 approving the implementation of Alltech's projects based thereon.








Whether actual environmental damage will occur if the project is implemented


 







For one, aggravated flooding in the Cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque is
 conceded to happen as a result of the Las PiÃ±as Coastal Bay Project and
 the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project. Even the Court of Appeals has 
admitted this when it said "
the threat of flooding as a consequence 
of land reclamation is conceded and thus the causal link between the 
human activity of reclamation and environmental threat of flooding is 
established
." The assailed Decision summarized petitioner's evidence on this allegation of environmental damage:




Petitioner Villar also commissioned Tricore Solutions, Inc.,
 an engineering consultant, to evaluate and assess the impact of the 
proposed reclamation project. Tricore came up with a report entitled 
"Flood Assessment and Evaluation for Las PiÃ±as City, ParaÃ±aque City and 
Bacoor, Cavite." In order to determine the existing flood extent along 
the vicinity of Las PiÃ±as City, ParaÃ±aque City and Bacoor, Cavite, the 
following scenarios were considered in the said report: 1) highest 
rainfall magnitude (as recorded) without reclamation; 2) highest 
rainfall magnitude (as recorded) with reclamation; 3) maximum rainfall 
magnitude and maximum high tide with reclamation; 4) highest rainfall 
magnitude (as recorded) with the highest storm surge, maximum high tide 
and sea water rise brought about by climate change with reclamation, 5) 
highest rainfall magnitude, highest storm surge and maximum high tide, 
sea water rise- again due to climate change with reclamation; and 6) 
highest rainfall magnitude, highest storm surge and maximum high tide, 
sea water rise- again due to climate change with reclamation and another
 reclamation in Bacoor, Cavite. According to Engineer Carvajal, who is 
the President, head hydrologist, sanitary, geoÂ­technical, structural and
 coastal engineer of Tricore, based on their hydrologic and hydraulic 
calculations, in a worst case scenario, taking into account Alltech's 
reclamation project and recorded maximum rainfall brought about by 
Typhoon Ondoy and strong winds experienced during Typhoon Pedring and 
other factors such as a maximum high tide of 1.44 meters and a one-meter
 rise above Mean Sea Level as may be occasioned by climate change, no 
less than 37 barangays in the Municipality of Bacoor, 17 barangays in 
Las PiÃ±as City and 11 barangays in ParaÃ±aque City, will be totally 
submerged under 0.15 meters to 5.12 meters of floodwater. In other 
words, almost two-thirds of the entire areas of the cities of Las PiÃ±as,
 ParaÃ±aque and Bacoor will be practically submerged or inundated when 
reclamation takes place.
[5]










Geological expert Kelvin S. Rodolfo, PhD
[6]
 cites four (4) reasons why reclamation of nearshore Manila Bay is "
a very bad idea
"
[7]
:








1. 


Rapid subsidence 
of coastal lands is
 enhancing the risk of flooding and high tides
.














2. 


Among the reasons for this rapid subsidence, 
says Rodolfo, is rapid loss of groundwater due to decades of 
uncontrolled pumping. Loss of groundwater has also caused the ground 
level to fall, leaving these areas vulnerable to flooding.
[8]














3. 


Storm surges are an ever-worsening threat, due
 in part to subsidence, but also because climate change is increasing 
the frequency of the strongest typhoons.














4.


Reclaimed coastal areas are very susceptible to liquefaction and enhanced ground-shaking during earthquakes.














5. 


These risks are enhanced by DPWH's and JICA's ignoring or minimizing the phenomena in their projects.







This scientific claim does not stand alone, as other studies, too, have 
noted the negative impact of reclamation, specifically of Manila Bay, 
viz
.:


Manila Bay was once a productive fishing area; destructive 
fishing practices, massive pollution, and unabated land conversion of 
wetlands and coastal areas have contributed to the marine ecosystem's 
deterioration. The destruction of Manila Bay's marine ecosystem 
threatens the food supply stability of surrounding communities.


Coastal communities around Manila Bay are already exposed to numerous 
natural hazards, particularly those related to earthquakes (e.g. 
liquefaction, tsunamis) and hydro-meteorological events (e.g., floods, 
storm surges). The effects of these hazards are exacerbated by 
accelerated land subsidence due to over-extraction of groundwater.


x x x x


The Philippine government has a clear directive to rehabilitate and 
preserve Manila Bay through the writ of continuing mandamus issued by 
the Philippine Supreme Court. Land reclamation directly contradicts that
 mandate. Furthermore, scientific evidence clearly shows the negative 
socio-economic effects of reclamation in Manila Bay. More reclamation 
project proposals continue to be entertained, nonetheless.
[9]





Verily, the 
question is not
 "whether actual environmental damage will occur" anymore, but 
how much more damage will it cause
, for it has consistently been found and proven that 
reclamation had actually and already caused environmental damage
. In fact, it is not only the aforementioned areas that will be exposed to flooding and inundation, 
but also the very reclaimed lands
 themselves.



For another, these reclamation projects and the eventual construction of road networks and bridges will more likely than not 
cause direct negative impacts upon the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA)
. The Court of Appeals summed up petitioner's evidence on this claim:


The Center for Environmental Concerns-Philippines (CECÂ­P) 
was also engaged by petitioner Villar to conduct a technical assessment 
of the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project. The study made by CEC-P 
involved the identification of plausible impacts of the Las 
PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project on biodiversity and the critical 
habitat, on flooding and on the socioÂ­economic situation of the 
residents in the cities of Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque. It did not assess 
the whole development plan as described in the proponent's EPRMP. The 
main document scrutinized by CEC-P in the study was the EPRMP submitted 
by Alltech to the DENR in August 2010 because it considered the same to 
be the final report on the proponent's proposed management of the 
environmental impacts before the issuance of the March 2011 ECC. The 
said EPRMP was the source document of CEC-P on how the proponent expects
 its project to affect the landscape and ecology of the project site, 
and what measures it has taken or will take to minimize the adverse 
effects that may be brought by this change. The CEC-P concluded that as a
 large scale project that will change the landscape of the area, the 
reclamation can be considered a looming danger to the habitat. The CEC-P
 findings are as follows: 1) As to the biophysical resources, the 
large-scale project will change the landscape of the area; development 
activities that will be undertaken in Manila Bay would likely impact the
 natural ecosystems and its ecological functions and services; 2) The 
expansion of the reclamation area will deposit and spread additional 
sediments to the Las PiÃ±as-ParaÃ±aque Critical Habitat Environment Area 
(LPPCHEA) which will further destroy habitats of existing biodiversity; 
3) With respect to the mangrove ecosystem situated in relation to the 
Coastal Bay Project, the coastal construction for the reclamation 
project will change the shoreline by altering the hydrodynamic 
characteristics of the Bay that include current, wave actions, tidal 
fluctuations and transport of sediments along the coasts, which would 
restrict circulation of coastal water bodies resulting to degradation of
 its water quality and environmental ecosystems; the mangrove ecosystem 
is also poised to undergo fundamental alterations and changes since the 
planned reclamation, which will begin from the coasts of the LPPCHEA 
facing the south China Sea, is likely to threaten and impede the 
continuous flow of seawater into the lagoon; 4) With regard to the 
biodiversity, the EPRMP, provides little or no information on the 
ecological functions of the mangroves, birds, and other living things 
which may be found in the reclamation area which suggests a haphazard 
study of the natural resources and the particular ecosystem that will be
 subject to the reclamation activity; 5) As to the marine life in the 
areas, construction activities such as dredging and filling would cause 
water turbidity and sedimentation that would result to decline in water 
quality, loss of species and toxic contamination of ecosystems; and 6) 
As to the socio-economic and cultural effects of the proposed Coastal 
Bay Project, one of the foreseen effects on the people would be 
diminished aquaculture production as the habitat and breeding ground of 
marine life will be destroyed.


According to Frances Quimpo, the Executive Director of the CEC-P, the 
study made by CEC-P had established firm bases to conclude that the LP-P
 Coastal bay project has not truly addressed the identified threats of 
flooding to surrounding areas, threats on biodiversity loss, as well as 
the threat of displacement of local livelihood; and that it lacks a 
clear scientific study on the flooding hazards of the reclamation, 
appropriate mitigation measures to counter the dangers of reclamation to
 the LPPCHEA, as well as the potential economic displacement of the 
fisher-folks in the area with the destruction of the bottom organisms 
that replenish marine life. She further asserted that the absence of an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was but redundant evidence that the
 Coastal Bay Project has not undertaken the 
de rigueur
 of a 
full-fledged environmental study in order to impart scientific 
confidence that the proposed reclamation project will not devastate the 
surrounding environment, whether human or wildlife, to within a 
manageable and acceptable margin. She finally recommended that the 
reclamation project be halted until competent, comprehensive, deeper 
research and study are conducted to ensure that lives, human or 
otherwise, are not unduly and unnecessarily put at the risk of 
irreparable harm and damage.


Another member of CEC-P, Giovanni A. Tapang, who is an Associate 
Professor in Physics in the National Institute of Physics, also noted 
that the coastal bay project lacks complete, multi-faceted blueprint for
 addressing the problem of flow of seawater; that Alltech's EPRMP did 
not specify measures for the maintenance of the brackish waters, and 
engineering interventions that would utilize the access road from Roxas 
Boulevard to facilitate sea water flow to the lagoon; and that the bold 
claim by Alltech that if the mitigation measures are implemented, the 
reclamation might even improve the flooding situation in the two cities,
 was not supported by data presented in Alltech's EPRMP.
[10]





The Court of Appeals also examined the evidence for respondents. Their pieces of evidence point to this conclusion:






On the other hand, Alltech and the other respondents were able to 
establish that scientific and expert studies assessed the potential 
flooding and flushing impact that may arise from the coastal bay 
project. The expert, objective studies conducted by DCCD, Surbana and 
DHI, revealed that 
if all the recommended mitigating measures were to
 be implemented, the Coastal bay project would not aggravate the 
flooding situation in the river mouths of ParaÃ±aque, Las PiÃ±as-Zapote 
Rivers
, and it may even reduce the level of flooding.
[11]





Hence, 
even respondents' evidence confirmed
 the conclusion of the
 Court of Appeals that "the threat of flooding as a consequence of land 
reclamation is conceded and thus the causal link between the human 
activity of reclamation and environmental threat of flooding is 
established."



Worse, respondents' position rests on the premise that 
the recommended mitigating measures
 being in place would purportedly prevent or "would 
not aggravate
"
 the flooding situations and "even reduce the level of flooding." 
Rodolfo, however, remains unconvinced and unimpressed by such measures 
for being historically ineffective and even aggravating,

And so it goes...



Clearly, respondents' confidence is misplaced. Short of any certainty, 
the promise of safety is but ideal and theoretical. In effect, 
respondents, again, have clearly acknowledged, nay, admitted that the 
proposed reclamation would cause devastating environmental impacts.





I personally commend the Court of Appeals for examining the evidence 
painstakingly on this claim of petitioner. But I most respectfully 
submit that the conclusion to dismiss the instant petition outright 
disregards the rationale for the writ of kalikasan. 
This writ is a protective remedy
, one where the usual balancing of the probative value of evidence is 
outweighed by the inclination to be cautious about activities
 that could probably wreak havoc on the environment.



Rule 20 of the 
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases
 recognizes this principle as a rule of law in assessing the evidence in environmental cases:




RULE 20




PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE


Section 1.
 
Applicability
. - When there is a 
lack of 
full scientific certainty in establishing a causal link between human 
activity and environmental effect, the court shall apply the 
precautionary principle
 in resolving the case before it.


The constitutional right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology shall be given the benefit of the doubt.


Section 2.
 
Standards for application
. - In applying the precautionary principle, the following factors, among others, may be considered: (1) 
threats to human life or health;
 (2) inequity to present or future generations; or (3) 
prejudice to the environment without legal consideration of the environmental rights of those affected
.


Here, everyone seems to concede that flood will come as a result of 
the Las PiÃ±as Coastal Bay Project and the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project.

 There will also be direct negative environmental impacts on the LPPCHEA
 as a result of the reclamation and related construction works. The 
Court of Appeals believes respondents' claim that 
only complete mitigation measures could foil
 the environmental degradations that the projects will bring about.



But is there certainty that the mitigation measures will come to pass, 
and if they do, will they produce what respondents hope they would? I do
 not think that respondents' pieces of evidence preponderantly resolve 
these questions in their favor. There are lots of variables in the 
projections ventured by respondents' evidence.


Worse, the Court of Appeals was made to decide the environmental impact of the projects 
as if from scratch

 simply because the government agency used the wrong document type in 
issuing the environmental compliance certificate. Had there been proper 
compliance from the start with the process of adducing the necessary 
variables in making the environmental assessment through, among others, 
the use of the appropriate document type, then we can state, indeed, 
that more likely than not, all environmental damages wrought by the 
projects will not come to pass.


Petitioner's burden of proof is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 All she has to prove is that more likely than not, if the reclamations 
do take place, damage to the environment will happen. I believe she has 
done that. Respondents merely claim in response that mitigation measures
 can offset this environmental damage. Their claim is not that there is 
no link between the projects and the harm; rather their claim is that 
their proposed mitigation measures might thwart the harm from taking 
place.



Clearly, as things stand, 
the totality of the evidence shows the causal link between the projects and the environmental damage
. The mitigation measures 
may

 prevent harm from happening, but that is conditional upon the 
mitigation measures being funded and done properly and later working 
properly as believed. At their best, thus, respondents' pieces of 
evidence prove and stand for an 
uncertainty
 in the context of a 
lack of full scientific certainty in establishing a causal link between 
human activity and environmental effect.



In this light, the Court is in the right to apply the 
precautionary principle

 in resolving the present case because (i) threats to human life or 
health as a result of the projects will occur if the mitigation measures
 do not work, and there is no certainty that they in fact will; (ii) 
inequity to present or future generations will be the costs of the 
uncertainties that the mitigation endeavours can only bring about; and 
(iii) prejudice to the environment without legal consideration of the 
environmental rights of those affected will be the price to pay as the 
environmental agency in charge of the environmental assessment failed to
 consult and obtain the consent of the residents to be greatly impacted 
by the projects.



Taking all things into consideration, the balancing of the evidence 
adduced by petitioner and respondents calls for a conclusion that 
the constitutional right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology shall be given the benefit of the doubt
. This means 
indulging the present case a second hard look

 at what the evidence presents us - an uncertainty that the Court can 
remedy by sending back the projects for environmental impact assessment 
using the Environmental Impact Statement as the document type and 
involving the residents in a genuine, not fake, consultation and 
consent-seeking foras. Thereafter, when the environmental people and the
 stakeholders have done all these and the conclusion is acceptable as it
 is reasonable and both rights- and evidenceÂ­based, if this matter ever 
reaches the Court of Appeals and the Court again, the justices will no 
longer be hard-pressed to choose between competing evidence, and in the 
process, to speculate about 
WHAT IFs and WHAT NOTs
.






Whether the actual environmental damage that has been assessed is fatally speculative


 







The world we live in is not fraught with environmental disasters and 
dangers because tree-huggers simply want to scare people from achieving 
development. 
These disasters have come and gone. They are a reality.

 We have all been witnesses to them. The lockdown caused by CoVID-19 has
 clear environmental aspects to it. And yet, here we go again trying to 
ignore the integrity and truthfulness of the 
science of patience and due diligence
 in our development endeavours.


What are we going to lose from seeking another and perhaps last round
 of weighing and determining the enormous environmental impact of 
respondents' large scale reclamation projects?



The 
only projected losses
, if losses they really are, 
simply equate to the delayed profits and more profits for respondents and their investors
. In contrast, if the Court were to 
allow post-haste the reclamations
 to go on 
without first settling the environmental issues
, when history beckons, 
the
 Court will be the real proximate cause of the disaster that will be 
done to the lives and properties of millions of already impoverished 
Filipinos
. As it is, 
the Court and petitioner in her role as a well-respected Senator
 are the 
only last bulwark of reason to stop this impending environmental pillage
.



Senator Villar is no ordinary petitioner. She carries with her the 
weight of the Philippine Senate as one of its outstanding leaders. She 
bears the burden of her constituents who stand to be severely affected 
by the adverse consequences of respondents' reclamations. She has put 
her reputation, if not her political career, into the cross-hairs of the
 causes, especially the present one, she tirelessly advocates. If the 
Court would not even care to hear her, who else will the Court listen 
to?



The issues involved in this case are 
literally transcendentally important
.
 The environmental impact will adversely affect Las PiÃ±as and ParaÃ±aque 
initially and thereafter transcend to contiguous territories and 
thereafter engulfing the entire country. It will initially impact the 
residents of these localities and thereafter transcend to swallow 
communities in the metropolis. The conversation that this case entails 
should not stop here and now. Lots are uncertain but can be clarified by
 further proceedings below. Massive floodings and other adverse 
environmental impacts of the reclamations are not our only choice, 
certainly not my only choice. I am still afraid to live in a raft.






Whether an environmentally critical project should be allowed to proceed only in the clearest of cases


 







The 
precautionary principle
 mentioned above should compel the Court to hold that an environmentally critical project should be allowed 
to proceed in the clearest of cases
. Hence, whenever 
there is doubt
 about a project's environmental impact, the project 
must be re-evaluated
 to investigate, weigh, mitigate, address, assess and resolve the oppositions to it.



The 
precautionary principle
 is 
very crucial
 especially when the President himself 
has vigorously espoused
 a 
policy against reclamation projects
. The 
President
 has been recorded to have enunciated this policy in the most colourful and emphatic language clearly for 
editorial
 impact. He said:


Not during my time. I will only allow maybe plans of 
whatever reclamation if it is in connection with a government project. I
 will not allow massive reclamation for the private sector. Not now. 
Because if I - if you approve one, you approve all. Ganun 'yan eh.

 


x x x x


The entire Manila City would be environmentally at peril. So pag-aralan 
ninyong mabuti 'yan. For the next administration, whoever gets to be the
 president of this country, study it very carefully. Because that Manila
 there, that old City is an old city and it will decay if you add so 
many things in front of Manila Bay.



x x x x


No - no reclamation. You wait until the next president who would be - 
they would look - they might look at it kindly at a different lens.
[13]



Independent expert studies also confirm the adverse environmental impact
 of reclamations. I have quoted them below in the interest of full 
disclosure:


Reclaimed lands are also to blame for the rise of the water 
level on the bay which causes massive flooding and storm surges. They 
badly affect not just the lives of the residents but also may shut down 
local economic activities particularly those in low-lying cities. These 
disasters actually intensify the vulnerability of our cities.
[14]


Reclamation activities changed the environment such as coastal 
morphology, hydro-oceanography, mangrove and coral reefs deterioration. 
Other effects are the hill-cutting and tree-cutting of the surrounding 
area to get filling materials for the reclamation project. Among the 
consequences observed and recorded were flooding, erosions, 
sedimentations, and adverse influences on the seawater quality, sea 
biota, local depletion of several kinds of fishes such as snappers, 
groupers, and shrimps. These have reduced the income of the fishermen, 
forcing them to switch to other professions such as becoming tradesmen, 
laborers, and farmers.
[15]


BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS


The process of coastal land reclamation starts off with sand mining and 
dredging operation carried out offshore, followed by backfilling. The 
activities carried out during reclamation have direct impacts towards 
the coastal ecosystem. The impacts include:


Loss of marine benthic ecosystem


Reclamation activities affect the composition of biodiversity through 
the destruction of ecosystems such as coral reefs, sea grass meadows and
 mudflats. This will lead to a net decline in faunal biomass and 
abundance or a shift in species composition. Once the ecosystem is 
disturbed, it will take some time for it to recover to its original 
state, depending on the ecosystem's resilience.


x x x x Modification of the ocean floor by reclamation works causes 
destruction to habitat of the benthic organisms. The disturbance to 
bottom sediment from dredging works and placement of fill materials will
 bury and smother bottom dwellers and cause permanent loss of habitat of
 benthos. Marine sediment extraction causes disturbance and removal of 
benthic in fauna and epifauna (Yasser, 2011).


Alteration of sediment composition caused by dredging and backfilling is
 another contributing factor to loss of marine benthic ecosystem. 
Sediment composition is a key factor in determining benthos 
distribution. Long-term recovery of benthic ecosystem can occur only 
where original sediment composition is being restored.


Destruction of buffer zone


Coastal reclamation is often associated with the loss of coastal 
ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrasses and mudflats. These ecosystem 
acts as natural buffers against wave energy and minimising the impacts 
of wave on coastal areas, thus protecting the coastal area from being 
flooded and eroded due to wave action.


Removal of the ecosystems will leave the coastal communities vulnerable 
to flooding and natural disaster such as tsunami. As widely reported 
since 2004 when the worst tsunami in record hit South East Asia, 
extensive areas of mangroves can reduce the loss of life and damage 
caused by tsunamis by taking the first brunt of the impact and by 
dissipating the energy of the wave as it passes through the mangrove 
area.


The survival of the fisherfolks at Pulau Betong, south-west of Penang 
Island, was attributed to the mangroves growing there. The mangrove 
forests had helped to buffer the impact of the tsunami heading inland as
 compared to other places that received a direct hit (Penang Economic 
Report, Jan. 2005, Vol. 7, Issue 1).


Disruption of food chain


Coastal developments directly disturb the substrates and 
microenvironments that benthic macro invertebrates depend on to survive.
 x x x x




Mangroves also serve to reduce coastal erosion and is a habitat for many
 species of marine life. They serve as a transit place for more than 30 
species of migratory birds, and house mudskippers, fish, crustaceans, 
and a whole ecosystem of its own. They are a home to all kinds of fish, 
snails, cockles, shrimps and crabs, reptiles like snakes and monitor 
lizards, migratory and local birds, insects and mammals such as monkeys,
 wild boars and otters. Birds seek these places as their sanctuary and 
feeding place during their migratory season from October to March.








It is proven that land reclamation does cause disjunctions in the 
consistency of suitable habitats for these organisms which we predict 
will affect organisms higher in the food chain (Chee & Sim, 2016; 
Chee et al., 2017). The stress tolerant species will become dominant and
 replace other species as they are able to stand the changes.


Collapsed ecosystems cannot sustain marine organisms that are dependent 
on it for survival. Shoreline modification and reclamation works will 
affect the existing biotic and abiotic factors that are linked in food 
chains. Any changes or disruption to the close relations between certain
 species will affect the ecosystem's balance. Removal of primary 
producers such as mangrove and seagrasses will affect the rest of the 
food chain as they serve as a base where every other organism depends on
 directly or indirectly for survival.


Coastal water pollution


Pollution can be controlled to some extent, but ecological and 
environmental impacts of reclamation cannot be restored. Suspension of 
organics, heavy metals and other pollutants into sea through dredging 
activities will cause disturbance to bottom sediments. Land filling with
 dredged materials may release contaminants which will have impacts on 
marine life. Eventually, low water quality will affect the sea biotas 
around the area, and negatively affect the lives of the fishes and coral
 reef (Priyandes & Majid, 2009).


Corals that are stressed by siltation, mechanical damage, or pollution 
have a greater likelihood of being subjected to diseases (Clark 1996). 
As coral reefs are well known as spawning ground, feeding ground, and 
nursery ground for enormous number of marine life, its destruction will 
cause breakdown in the ecosystem.


Other than that, sea grass leaves improve[d] water quality by absorbing 
nutrients in runoff from the land and slowing the velocity of water, 
capturing sand, dirt and silt particles. When the bottom sediments are 
disturbed during reclamation projects, it causes the release of toxic 
chemicals including heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) 
into water column which was trapped by sea grass earlier. The release of
 toxic compounds will degrade the water quality and affect the aquatic 
life.


Increase in siltation and turbidity


Dredging and extraction of aggregates from the benthic zone or the 
seabed is a form of disturbance that leads to increase of suspended 
particles in the water column. Dredged material may cause suspended 
solids during dredging as a result of substratum disturbance and during 
transport to the surface, overflow from barges or leakage from pipelines
 during transport between dredged and disposal sites (Yasser, 2011).


Aggregate particles that are too fine to be used are rejected by 
dredging boats, releasing vast dust plumes and change the water 
turbidity, resulting in major changes to aquatic habitats over a large 
area. The ecosystems that will be greatly affected by siltation are the 
coral reefs and sea grasses. Siltation kills corals by shading and 
smothering them and reduces recruitment of juvenile corals (DENR 2001).


Smothered sea grasses will not be able to take up the sunlight 
efficiently to carry out photosynthesis. In addition, increased 
turbidity will increase the scattering of light penetrating the water, 
causing difficulties to photosynthetic benthic organism to absorb the 
sunlight. x x x x


SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS


Livelihood and fisheries


Coastline changes in the coastal areas due to reclamation will impact 
the local community in that area. Local fishers whose livelihood and 
source of income depended on the fishing industry are adversely impacted
 due to land reclamation. x x x x


Other adverse impact includes the reduction of daily fish catch by the 
fishermen, forcing them to either double their efforts in catching fish 
or totally abandon their age-old profession to try other jobs (Priyandes
 & Majid, 2009). However, without experience and knowledge, it will 
be difficult for them to adjust to their new way of life. x x x x


PHYSICAL IMPACTS


(A) Saltwater intrusion and alteration of groundwater system

 

 

Land reclamation activities in coastal areas causes changes on local 
groundwater systems (Guo & Jiao, 2007). This is because the removal 
of crucial ecosystems such as mangrove and mudflats maximises the 
impacts of wave on coastal areas, causing seawater intrusion into 
groundwater. This will affect nearby agriculture land as the pH of the 
soil is altered thus making it unsuitable for plant growth, especially 
species that are sensitive to salinity changes. x x x x


OTHER IMPACTS


Temporary increase in noise pollution and air quality is likely to occur
 at the site, caused by construction and reclamation processes. Dust and
 particulate generation due to movement into and off the site like 
scrappers, bulldozers, and loaders and due to excavated soil is the 
negative impact of temporary workforce (Yasser, 2011). This gives a 
negative psychological and physical impact to the people around the 
area. x x x x


The stress level of the residents might increase due to traffic 
congestion as many routes will be inaccessible for reclamation 
development Therefore, the residents were left with no choice but to 
take alternative routes, causing inconveniences due to the restrictive 
access.
[16]
 



Contrary to the 
ponencia
's dismissive attitude towards the foregoing studies, these studies show that the 
precautionary principle
 apply in this case. The Court 
cannot ignore
 these studies because they are cited precisely to justify the 
plausibility
 of the project's adverse environmental impact. The 
proper forum
 for considering these and other studies is of course the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
However
, by affirming the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals, and approving the commencement of the project, the Court is 
thereby foreclosing

 any further deliberate studies on the real adverse impact of the 
project. This could prove to be disastrous for the communities near the 
project site.



Notably, the Rules on Evidence allows the Court to take judicial notice of certain facts, such as the laws of nature. In 
MMDA v. Concerned Citizens of Manila Bay
,
[17]

 the Court took judicial notice of the environmental pollution as a 
cause of climate change, its ill effects including but not limited to 
the destruction of forests, and other critical habitat, oil spills, and 
the unabated improper disposal of garbage in Manila Bay.
[18]

 So too, can we take judicial notice not only of the independent expert 
studies which either confirm or dispel the adverse environmental impact 
of reclamations. It is our bounden duty to leave no stone unturned when 
it comes to the safety and protection of our environment.


ACCORDINGLY
, I vote to grant the petition in part, to revoke the 
environmental compliance certificate issued for the Las PiÃ±as Coastal 
Bay Project and the ParaÃ±aque Coastal Bay Project, and to refer these 
projects back to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for
 the proper conduct of the environmental impact assessment using as 
document type the Environmental Impact Statement.
