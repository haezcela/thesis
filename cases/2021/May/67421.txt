SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 238462, May 12, 2021 ]


ELENA R. QUIAMBAO, PETITIONER, VS. CHINA BANKING CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




LOPEZ, M., J.:


A contract of adhesion is a veritable trap for the weaker party whom the
 courts are bound to protect from abuse and imposition. Hence, in case 
of doubt which will cause a great imbalance of rights, the contract 
shall be construed strictly against the party who prepared it.
[1]
 This resolves the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[2]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) Decision
[3]
 dated September 11, 2017 and Resolution
[4]
 dated March 21, 2018 in CA-G.R. CV No. 97888.


ANTECEDENTS



On April 3, 1990, Elena R. Quiambao (Elena) borrowed P1,400,000.00
[5]
 from China Banking Corporation to increase the working capital of her general merchandising business.
[6]
 On even date, Elena and her common-law husband and business partner Daniel S. Sy (Daniel) executed a Real Estate Mortgage
[7]
 (REM) over a parcel of land registered under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 227449-PR21432 as security for the loan.
[8]
 Later, the REM was amended several times increasing the loan to P1,770,000.00 on April 29, 1993,
[9]
 P2,600,000.00 on April 28, 1995;
[10]
 and P4,000,000.00 on April 29, 1997.
[11]
 The amendments contained a "
blanket mortgage clause
" stating that the REM would secure the payment of obligations already incurred or which may be subsequently incurred.





On March 1, 2005, China Banking Corporation filed a petition for 
foreclosure of the REM with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) alleging that
 Elena and Daniel obtained P5,000,000.00 succeeding loan accommodations 
covered by eight promissory notes (PNs),
[12]

In due course, the RTC issued a notice of extra-judicial sale scheduled on May 5, 2005.
[13]
 The notice was published in a newspaper of general circulation
[14]

 and posted in public places. At the public auction sale, the mortgaged 
property was sold to China Banking Corporation for the amount of 
P5,254,708.00. On May 6, 2005, the Ce1iificate of Sale was issued to 
China Banking Corporation.
[15]

 However, Elena and Daniel failed to redeem the property. Thus, the 
title was consolidated in the name of China Banking Corporation.
[16]
 Accordingly, TCT No. 227449-PR 21432
[17]
 in the name of Elena was cancelled and TCT No. N-307380
[18]
 was issued in the name of China Banking Corporation.






 





Thereafter, Elena filed against China Banking Corporation a petition to 
annul the mortgage and the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings with 
prayer for injunctive relief before the RTC.
[19]

 Elena argued that the REM only covered the loan secured on April 3, 
1990, and its amendments but not her succeeding loans for P5,000,000.00.
[20]

 In contrast, China Banking Corporation maintained that Elena's loan on 
April 3, 1990, was extended and renewed up to March 2004. Yet, Elena 
merely paid the interests but not the principal.
[21]



At the trial, Elena testified that she was made to sign blank documents 
and blank PNs when she transacted with China Banking Corporation. The 
last mortgage document that she signed was on April 29, 1997. On the 
other hand, China Banking Corporation's loan assistant testified that PN
 No. 001071438693 executed on March 19, 2004 was not subject of the REM.
[22]





On February 22, 2011, the RTC granted the petition and ruled that the 
eight PNs executed from March 19, 2004 to June 16, 2004 cannot be the 
basis for the foreclosure proceedings since one PN was clean or 
unsecured,
[23]
 thus:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioner and against the respondents [
sic
].
 The Amendment to the Real Estate Mortgage dated April 29, 1997 is 
declared null and void and the Extra-judicial foreclosure sale executed 
on May 5, 2005 is likewise declared null and void.




x x x x



SO ORDERED.
[24]




On September 11, 2017, the CA reversed the RTC's findings and held that 
the REM was intended to secure all succeeding obligations of Elena in 
view of the blanket mortgage clause.
[25]

 The CA noted that Elena and Daniel were capable of understanding the 
legal effects of contracts given their business experience, thus:


[Elena] and [Daniel's] lengthy actual experience and 
dealings in running their complex money[-]changing business and various 
other businesses, more than equipped them with the business acumen that 
earned them millions. [Elena] and [Daniel] have long been engaged in 
business even prior to 1990. The latter affim1ed that he managed their 
general merchandising business continuously up to the time he testified 
on June 28, 2006. The contracting parties, being of age and businessmen 
of experience, were presumed to have acted with due care and to have 
signed the contracts with full knowledge of their import.
[26]
 (Citation omitted.)





Hence, this recourse. Elena maintains that she and Daniel signed the 
eight PNs in blank or without the material particulars. They thought 
that these are character loans without any renewal of mortgage. Lastly, 
Elena only finished high school while Daniel reached only grade two. 
They both have limited educational attainment which prevented them from 
discerning the effects of the transactions.
[27]

 Meantime, China Banking Corporation advised Elena to remove her 
personal belongings from the foreclosed property, otherwise it will be 
forced to dispose them. Aggrieved, Elena moved to hold in abeyance the 
hauling off, and disposal of her personal properties.


RULING



The petition is meritorious.



Elena raises a question regarding the appreciation of evidence which is 
one of fact, and is beyond the ambit of this Court's jurisdiction in a 
petition for review on 
certiorari
. It is not this Court's task to go over the proofs presented below to ascertain if they were weighed correctly.
[28]

 However, this rule of limited jurisdiction admits of exceptions and one
 of them is when the factual findings of the CA and the RTC are 
contradictory.
[29]
 In this 
case, the RTC concluded that the eight promissory notes from March 19, 
2004 to June 16, 2004 cannot be the bases for foreclosure proceedings 
while the CA ruled that the REM validly secured these succeeding loan 
obligations. Considering these conflicting findings warranting the 
examination of evidence, this Court will entertain the factual issues 
raised in the petition.



In a contract of adhesion, one imposes a ready-made contract to the 
other whose sole participation is either to accept or reject the 
agreement.
[30]
 The parties do not bargain on equal footing in the execution of this kind of contract given that the debtor is limited "
to take it or leave it
" option
[31]
 and there is no room for negotiation.
[32]

 However, such contract is not entirely prohibited. The one adhering is 
free to give his consent inasmuch as he is also free to reject it 
completely.
[33]
 Inarguably, 
the amendments to the REM are contracts of adhesion. It was China 
Banking Corporation which drafted and prepared the standard forms on 
which Elena and Daniel merely affixed their signatures. At the trial, it
 was established that Elena and Daniel signed the amendments to the REM 
in blank. They presented 
pro forma
 blank documents that China 
Banking Corporation is giving to all borrowers for signature. 
Corollarily, any ambiguity in the provisions of these documents must be 
interpreted against China Banking Corporation.





Notably, there is a controversy on whether the "
blanket mortgage clause
"
 in the latest amendment to the REM dated April 29, 1997 covers the 
P5,000,000.00 succeeding loans under the eight PNs for which the 
mortgage was foreclosed. We stress that a "
blanket mortgage clause
" or "
dragnet clause
" subsumes all debts of past or future origins
[34]

 and makes additional funds available to a borrower without the need to 
execute separate security documents, thus, saving time, costs, and other
 resources.
[35]
 Jurisprudence recognizes the validity of this clause
[36]
 but its terms must still be judiciously examined.
[37]



In 
Paradigm Development Corporation of the Phils. v. Bank of the Philippine Islands
,
[38]

 this Court held that while a REM may exceptionally secure future loans 
or advancements, these future debts must be specifically described or 
must come fairly within the terms of the mortgage contract. A mortgage 
containing a dragnet clause will not be extended to cover future 
advances, unless the document evidencing the subsequent advance refers 
to the mortgage as providing security therefor, or unless there are 
clear and supportive evidence to the contrary. In that case, the 
foreclosure proceedings were declared void because there is uncertainty 
on whether the promissory notes were secured or not. It was not shown 
that the PNs are within the terms of the limited liability of the 
debtor, thus:


Nonetheless, the parties do not dispute that what the REMs 
secured were only Sengkon's availments under the Credit Line and not all
 of Sengkon's availments under other sub-facilities which are also 
secured by other collaterals. Since the liability of PDCP's properties 
was not unqualified, the PNs, used as basis of the Petition for 
Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage 
should sufficiently indicate that it is within the terms of PDCP's limited liability
.
 In this case, the PNs failed to make any reference to PDCP's 
availments, if any, under its Credit Line. In fact, it did not even 
mention Sengkon's securities under the Credit Line. Notably, the 
Disclosure Statements, which were "certified correct" by FEBTC's 
authorized representative, Ma. Luisa C. Ellescas, and which accompanied 
the PNs, 
failed to disclose whether the loan secured thereby was actually secured or not
.
[39]
 (Emphases supplied and citation omitted.)




Here, the eight PNs likewise failed to allude to Elena and Daniel's 
liability under the latest amendment to the REM dated April 29, 1997. 
The PNs do not even make any reference to the REM as a security. 
Further, China Banking Corporation did not adduce any evidence proving 
that the REM and its amendments secured these obligations. Worse, China 
Banking Corporation's loan assistant categorically testified that one of
 the PNs was not subject of the REM. Hence, the doubt on whether the 
rest of the PNs are secured or not must be construed against China 
Banking Corporation or the party who prepared the contracts. The bank 
could have avoided the ambiguity had it exercised a little more care in 
drafting the instruments. Consequently, the latest amendment to the REM 
cannot be interpreted to cover the P5,000,000.00 succeeding loans under 
the eight PNs for which the mortgage was foreclosed. As such, the 
foreclosure proceedings are void. The bank cannot validly foreclose a 
mortgage based on non-payment of unsecured PNs.



Moreover, it is undisputed that Elena only finished high school while 
Daniel reached only grade two. They cannot be expected to understand all
 the technicalities and foresee the legal implications of the 
transactions despite their business experience. Differently stated, 
Elena and Daniel lacked the adeptness to fully comprehend the effects of
 the amendments to the REM. On the other hand, China Banking Corporation
 merely concluded that Elena and Daniel freely, voluntarily, and 
willingly entered into the amendments to the REM but did not prove, let 
alone allege, that it made an effort to explain to them and ensure that 
they indeed understand the stipulations in the contract. Hence, there is
 reason for the court to step in and protect the interest of the weaker 
party, thus:


The peculiar nature of such contracts behooves the Court 
to closely scrutinize the factual milieu to which the provisions are 
intended to apply.
 Thus, just as consistently and unhesitatingly, but without categorically invalidating such contracts, 
the
 Court has construed obscurities and ambiguities in the restrictive 
provisions of contracts of adhesion strictly albeit not unreasonably 
against the drafter thereof when justified in light of the operative 
facts and surrounding circumstances.
[40]
 (Emphases supplied and citation omitted.)




We reiterate that the validity or enforceability of the impugned 
contracts will have to be determined by the peculiar circumstances 
obtaining in each case and the situation of the parties concerned.
[41]

 The stringent treatment towards a contract of adhesion is pursuant to 
the mandate that in all contractual, property, or other relations, when 
one of the parties is at a disadvantage on account of his moral 
dependence, ignorance, indigence, mental weakness, tender age or other 
handicap, the courts must be vigilant for his protection.
[42]



Lastly, there is no need to rule on Elena's motion to hold in abeyance 
the removal of her personal belongings from the foreclosed property 
considering the favorable decision on the merits declaring void the 
amendments to the REM and the foreclosure proceedings.
