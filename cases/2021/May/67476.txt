FIRST DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 241890, May 03, 2021 ]


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. AVELINO MANANSALA, HEIR OF THE LATE FEL M. MANANSALA, REPRESENTED BY ESMERALDO M. MANANSALA, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




CAGUIOA, J:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review
[1]
 (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Rules) seeking the reversal of the Decision
[2]
 dated December 7, 2017
[3]
 and Resolution
[4]
 dated September 5, 2018 of the Court of Appeals
[5]
 (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107267. The CA Decision affirmed the Decision
[6]

 dated December 7, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court of Bacoor City, 
Branch 19 (RTC) in LRC Case No. 8843-2014-29 while the CA Resolution 
denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.


The Facts


The CA Decision narrates the antecedents as follows:


[Respondent Avelino M. Manansala (respondent)] is the sole 
heir of Fel Manansala (Fel). During his lifetime, Fel owned two x x x 
parcels of land situated in the Municipality of Carmona, Province of 
Cavite and covered by 
TCT
[7]
 Nos. T-4773
 and 
T-2822
 respectively x x x.




x x x x


On June 25, 1997, Fel died leaving the mass of his property, which 
included the subject lots, to [respondent]. [Respondent] executed an 
Extra-Judicial Settlement
 of his father's estate, adjudicating upon himself sole ownership over the parcels of land covered by 
TCT Nos. T-4773
 and 
T-2822
.
 He submitted a copy thereof in the Office of the Registry of Deeds [for
 the Province of Cavite] [(RD)] for registration, which the [RD] refused
 because [respondent] failed to present the original copies of 
TCT Nos. T-4773
 and 
T-2822
. [Respondent] presented a 
Certification
,
 to prove that the subject TCTs were among those burned during the fire 
that razed the building which housed the [RD] sometime in 1959.




On January 27, 2014, [respondent] designated his son, Esmeraldo as his 
attorney-in-fact. Esmeraldo filed the instant petition for the judicial 
reconstitution of 
TCT Nos. T-4773
 and 
T-2822
 before the [RTC], on the basis of the owner's duplicate copies in his possession.


On May 26, 2014, the Land Registration Authority (LRA) rendered its initial 
Report
 (
First
 Report) [issued by Roselle Antonette P. Lazo-Favis, Assistant Chief of the Reconstitution Division in the LRA
[8]
], addressed to the [RTC] which pertinently stated, to wit:


x x x


2. Examination and verification of the photocopies of TCT Nos. T-4773
 and T-2822 reveal the following observations/findings[,] to wit:








2.1.


 
It appears on both titles 
that the same were issued under LRC Record No. 53673 pursuant to Decree 
No. 754698 in the Registry of Deeds of Cavite. 
Verification of 
our records, however, reveals that LRC Record No. 53673 was issued 
Decree No. 717402 for a parcel of land situated in Batangas City[;]
 (Emphasis supplied)














2.2.


 
Lots 1131 and 1132 Cad. 285 of Carmona, 
Cavite were embraced in Cad. Case 12, Cad. Rec. No. 2166, however, no 
Cadastral Book is on file at the Cadastral Decree Section, this 
Authority. Both lots when plotted on MIS G321 appear to be equivalent of
 Lots [1 & 2], respectively of Plan Psu-108561, GLRO Rec. No. 
14623[;]






3. From the foregoing, 
it appears that both titles did not exist 
in the Registry of Deeds of Cavite, because the information contained 
therein are not in accordance with our records
. (Emphasis supplied)


[Respondent] submitted his counter-evidence in refutation of the 
aforesaid findings and asked the LRA for a replotting and re-evaluation 
of the same. Pursuant thereto, the LRA issued a subsequent 
Report
, dated February 6, 2015 (
Second
 Report) [issued by Roselle Antonette P. LazoÂ­Favis, Assistant Chief of the Reconstitution Division in the LRA
[9]
], which reversed its previous observation thus:


In reference to the 2[6] May 2014 Report
 of this 
Office involving the above-mentioned case which petitions for the 
reconstitution of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-4773 and T-2822 
purportedly registered in the name of Fel M. Manansala, this Authority, 
upon replotting and reÂ­evaluation thereof, makes the following findings:


The technical descriptions
 of Lots 1131 & 
1132, both of the Cadastral Survey of Carmona, [C]ad. 285, situated in 
the Municipality of Carmona, Province of Cavite, 
appearing on the 
reproductions of owner's duplicate copies of Transfer Certificate[s] of 
Title Nos. T-4773 and T-2822 were found correct after examination and 
due computation
. Said technical descriptions when plotted on 
Municipal Index Sheet No. G321, do not appear to overlap previously 
plotted/ decreed properties in the aforesaid area.
 (Emphasis supplied)


The [RTC] summoned the Chief of the Reconstitution and Docket Division 
of the LRA to explain the two (2) conflicting LRA Reports but said 
officer failed to appear, despite due notice. The government prosecutor 
deputized by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) participated in 
the trial of the case but did not present controverting evidence.


Ruling of the RTC


[The RTC] rendered its assailed 
Decision
[10]
 [dated December 7, 2015], the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, petitioner 
[(herein respondent)] having proven by preponderance of evidence [his] 
allegations in the petition[,] the same is hereby 
GRANTED
.


The Office of the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Cavite is 
hereby ordered to reconstitute the original copies of Transfer 
Certificate[s] of [Title] No[s]. T-4773 and T-2822 registered in the 
name of Fel M. Manansala using as basis the owners' duplicate copies 
thereof subject to encumbrances as may be subsisting therein, upon 
payment of the corresponding legal fees.


The lost original cop[ies] of the Transfer Certificate[s] of [Title] 
No[s]. T-4773 and T-2822 are hereby declared null and void and of no 
force and effect.


SO ORDERED.


Unsatisfied with the said ruling, [petitioner], through the OSG, filed [an] appeal [before the CA].
[11]


Ruling of the CA



The CA in its Decision
[12]
 dated December 7, 2017 found the appeal without merit. The dispositive portion thereof states:


WHEREFORE
, in view of all the foregoing, the Appeal is 
DISMISSED
. The December 7, 2015 
Decision
 of the RTC of Bacoor City, Branch 19, in LRC 
Case No. 8843-2014-29
 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
.


SO ORDERED.
[13]



Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied in its Resolution
[14]
 dated September 5, 2018.



Hence the present Petition. Respondent filed his Comment
[15]
 dated March 29, 2019. Petitioner filed its Reply
[16]
 to the Comment dated August 19, 2019.


The Issue



The Petition essentially raises the issue: whether the CA erred in 
affirming the December 7, 2015 RTC Decision, which granted the petition 
for reconstitution of the alleged lost and destroyed original TCT Nos. 
T-4773 and T-2882 based on the conflicting 
First
 and 
Second
 Reports issued by Roselle Antonette P. Lazo-Favis, Assistant Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the LRA.


The Court's Ruling



The Petition has merit.








 



At the outset, it is well to reiterate the quantum of evidence required 
in the reconstitution of a lost or destroyed certificate of title. In 
this respect, 
Dela Paz v. Republic
[17]
 instructs that:


Time and time again, we have cautioned the lower courts 
against the hasty and reckless grant of petitions for reconstitution. In
 such cases, it is the duty of the court to carefully scrutinize and 
verify all supporting documents, deeds, and certifications. In fact, we 
have warned the courts in reconstitution proceedings of the tampering of
 genuine certificates of title and the issuance of fake ones - a 
widespread occurrence that has seriously threatened the stability of our
 Torrens system. It is most unfortunate that our courts have been, at 
times, unwitting accomplices to these transactions and easy targets for 
corruption.


Reconstitution is the restoration of the instrument or title allegedly 
lost or destroyed in its original form and condition. Its only purpose 
is to have the title reproduced, after observing the procedure 
prescribed by law, in the same form they were when the loss or 
destruction occurred. The process involves diligent circumspect 
evaluation of the authenticity and relevance of all the evidence 
presented for fear of the chilling consequences of mistakenly issuing a 
reconstituted title when in fact the original is not truly lost or 
destroyed[, or when an original title does not even exist in the name of
 the petitioner or the person from whom the petitioner derives his 
purported claim or right.]


Henceforth, it is imperative that a proper standard be set in evaluating
 the probative value of the documentary evidence. Having such a standard
 would guide our courts accordingly in granting the reconstitution of a 
certificate of title, and would serve as a yardstick in determining 
whether trial court judges have grossly violated their judicial duty to 
warrant the imposition of administrative sanctions.


The established legal principle in actions involving land registration 
is that a party must prove its allegations not merely by a preponderance
 of evidence, but by clear and convincing evidence. Evidence is clear 
and convincing if it produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm 
belief or conviction as to the allegation sought to be established. It 
is indeterminate, being more than preponderance, but not to the extent 
of such certainty as is required beyond reasonable doubt in criminal 
cases. Appropriately, this is the standard of proof that is required in 
reconstitution proceedings.
[18]



Given that the required quantum of evidence to reconstitute a 
certificate of title is not mere preponderance of evidence, but clear 
and convincing evidence producing in the mind of the trier of facts a 
firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be 
established, the RTC erred in granting the petition for reconstitution 
based on mere preponderance of evidence and the CA erred in affirming 
the RTC Decision based on the same quantum of evidence.











The records bear out that only Esmeraldo Manansala (Esmeraldo), 
attorney-in-fact of respondent Avelino Manansala (Avelino), was 
presented as witness before the RTC and who testified that: he is the 
son of Avelino; his father is the only heir of the late Fel M. Manansala
 (Fel), who died on June 25, 1997, and left behind two parcels of land 
situated in Carmona, Cavite (with respective areas of 520,638 square 
meters and 96,235 square meters and covered by TCT No. T-4773 and TCT 
No. T-2822); as the only heir, Avelino executed an Extra-Judicial 
Settlement of Estate of his father and adjudicated upon himself the said
 parcels of land; Avelino tried to register the Extra-Judicial 
Settlement of Estate with the Office of the Registry of Deeds of Cavite 
(RD), but its registration was denied on the ground that the original 
copies of said titles were among those burned during the fire that razed
 the Office of the RD in June 1959; a Report dated May 26, 2014 (
First

 Report) was issued by the LRA; to rebut said report, a Certification 
dated December 10, 2013 from the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR) stating that the subject properties were verified to be
 within the "Alienable and Disposable Land under Project No. 8 of 
Carmona, Cavite per Land Classification Map 2589 certified on December 
10, 1965, the survey plan under PCS-04-010644 approved on October 30, 
1996, the accompanying Lot Data Computation describing the properties 
identified as Lot 1131 and Lot 1132, showing that they are located in 
Carmona, Cavite, and a Vicinity Plan/Plot issued by DENR-LMS, Region IV 
(Calabarzon), showing the location of Lot 1131 and Lot 1132 in Carmona, 
Cavite were presented; given the said findings of the DENR, Avelino 
requested the LRA for a re-plotting and re-evaluation of the subject 
parcels of land; and a Report dated February 6, 2015 (
Second
 Report) was subsequently issued by the LRA. Subpoena 
ad testificandum

 was sent to the Chief of the Reconstitution/Docket Division and/or any 
authorized representative of the LRA, but no one appeared despite 
notice.
[19]





Aside from the two LRA Reports, Esmeraldo, who was respondent's only 
witness, identified the following documents: (a) Special Power of 
Attorney, (b) Extra-Judicial Settlement of Estate, (c) Death Certificate
 of Avelino, (d) Owner's Duplicate Copies of TCT Nos. T-4773 and T-2882,
 (e) Certification issued by DENR Regional Office IV-A, (f) Survey Plan,
 (g) Certification issued by the RD, and (h) DENR Region IV Calabarzon 
Vicinity Plan/Plot.
[20]





Based on the CA Decision, it is evident that the CA relied primarily on the 
Second

 Report of the LRA in finding the owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-4773 
and TCT No. T-2822, which respondent presented before the RTC, to be 
authentic, and as such, could therefore be the source of respondent's 
petition for reconstitution. Pertinently, the CA Decision states:


In the present case, [respondent's] quest for judicial reconstitution x x x is anchored on his owner's duplicate cop[ies] of 
TCT Nos. T-4773
 and 
T-2822
. It bears stressing that [petitioner] assails [their] authen[ti]city, only because of the existence of the 
First
 Report which the LRA eventually corrected in its 
Second
 Report.


x x x x

It is well to note that upon replotting of the lots described in 
TCT Nos. T-4773
 and 
T-2822
, the LRA found that there [was] no overlapping of boundaries with existing registered lands as previously mentioned in its 
First
 Report. Conformably with the foregoing, the LRA issued its 
Second
 Report after realizing that its previous findings were erroneous. The existence of the 
Second

 Report did not in any way impair the authenticity of [respondent's] 
duplicate cop[ies] of the subject TCTs, but in fact buttressed the same.
[21]



Unfortunately, the reliance by the CA on the 
Second
 Report is 
erroneous. As will be explained subsequently, both LRA Reports have no 
probative value. The same holds true with respect to the certifications 
and other documents issued by the DENR and the RD. Besides, the RD 
certification is equivocal and cannot be relied upon as proof that the 
original TCT No. T-4773 and TCT No. T-2822 were destroyed when the 
office of the RD was burned in 1959. The RD certification simply states:


THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THE PROVINCIAL CAPITOL BUILDING IN 
CAVITE CITY WAS RAZED TO THE GROUND [O]N JUNE 7, 1959 HOUSING THE OFFICE
 OF THE REGISTER OF DEEDS.
[22]


In 
Republic v. Galeno
[23]
 (
Galeno
),
 the Court made these pronouncements on the nature of certifications 
issued by government officials, which have been adduced through a third 
person, and their probative value:


A scrutiny of the evidence marked and formally offered by respondent before the court 
a quo

 shows that the former failed to prove that there was sufficient basis 
to allow the correction of the area of the subject property in OCT No. 
46417 from 20,948 square meters to 21,248 square meters.


Records reveal that respondent offered in evidence the following documents: (
a
)
 the Certification issued by a certain Althea C. Acevedo (Acevedo), 
Engineer IV, Chief of the Technical Services Section of the Office of 
the Regional Technical Director, Land Management Services of the DENR in
 Iloilo City, which states that "the true and correct area of [L]ot 
2285, Cad. 246 Dingle Cadastre is 21,928 square meters;" (
b
) the 
technical description of Lot No. 2285, a copy of which was certified by 
Ameto Caballero (Caballero), Chief of the Surveys Division, while 
another copy was certified correct by Acevedo; and (
c
) the 
approved subdivision plan of Lot No. 2258, certified by Rogelio M. 
Santome (Santome), Geodetic Engineer; Alfredo Muyarsas (Muyarsas), Chief
 of the Regional Surveys Division, and Edgardo R. Gerobin (Gerobin), 
OIC, Regional Technical Director of the Land Management Services, DENR. 
On the strength of these pieces of evidence, respondent sought a 
reconciliation of the area of the subject property with the records of 
the DENR.




Unfortunately, the foregoing documentary evidence are not sufficient to 
warrant the correction prayed for. The Court cannot accord probative 
weight upon them in view of the fact that the public officers who issued
 the same did not testify in court to prove the facts stated therein.


In 
Republic v. Medida
, the Court held that certifications of the Regional Technical Director, DENR cannot be considered 
prima facie
 evidence of the facts stated therein, holding that:


Public documents are defined under Section 19, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence as follows:


(a) The written official acts, or records of the official acts of the 
sovereign authority, official bodies and tribunals, and public officers,
 whether of the Philippines, or of a foreign country;


(b) Documents acknowledged before a notary public except last wills and testaments; and


(c) Public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein.


Applying Section 24 of Rule 132, the record of public documents referred
 to in Section 19(a), when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced 
by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer 
having legal custody of the record, or by his deputy x x x.


Section 23, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides:


"Sec. 23. 
Public documents as evidence
. - Documents consisting of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a public officer are 
prima facie

 evidence of the facts stated therein. All other public documents are 
evidence, even against a third person, of the fact which gave rise to 
their execution and of the date of the latter."


The CENRO and 
Regional Technical Director, FMS-DENR, certifications 
[do] not fall within the class of public documents contemplated in the 
first sentence of Section 23 of Rule 132
. The certifications do not 
reflect "entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a
 public officer," such as entries made by the Civil Registrar in the 
books of registries, or by a ship captain in the ship's logbook. 
The 
certifications are not the certified copies or authenticated 
reproductions of original official records in the legal custody of a 
government office. The certifications are not even records of public 
documents.
 x x x (Emphases supplied)


As such, 
sans
 the testimonies of Acevedo, Caballero, and the 
other public officers who issued respondent's documentary evidence to 
confirm the veracity of [their] contents, the same are bereft of 
probative value and cannot, by their mere issuance, prove the facts 
stated therein. At best, they may be considered only as 
prima facie
 evidence of their due execution and date of issuance but do not constitute 
prima facie
 evidence of the facts stated therein.


In fact, the contents of the certifications are hearsay because 
respondent's sole witness and attorney-in-fact, Lea Galeno Barraca, was 
incompetent to testify on the veracity of their contents, as she did not
 prepare any of the certifications nor was she a public officer of the 
concerned government agencies. Notably, while it is true that the public
 prosecutor who represented petitioner interposed no objection to the 
admission of the foregoing evidence in the proceedings in the court 
below, it should be borne in mind that "hearsay evidence, whether 
objected to or not, has no probative value unless the proponent can show
 that the evidence falls within the exceptions to the hearsay evidence 
rule," which do not, however, obtain in this case. Verily, while 
respondent's documentary evidence may have been admitted due to the 
opposing party's lack of objection, it does not, however, mean that they
 should be accorded any probative weight. The Court has explained that:


The general rule is that hearsay evidence is not admissible.
 However, the lack of objection to hearsay testimony may result in its 
being admitted as evidence. But one should not be misled into thinking 
that such declarations are thereby impressed with probative value. 
Admissibility of evidence should not be equated with weight of evidence.
 Hearsay evidence whether objected to or not cannot be given credence 
for it has no probative value.


Besides, case law states that the "absence of opposition from government
 agencies is of no controlling significance because the State cannot be 
estopped by the omission, mistake or error of its officials or agents. 
Neither is the Republic barred from assailing the decision granting the 
petition for reconstitution [or correction of title, as in this case] 
if, on the basis of the law and the evidence on record, such petition 
has no merit." Moreover, "in civil cases, the party having the burden of
 proof must produce a preponderance of evidence thereon, with plaintiff 
having to rely on the strength of his own evidence and not upon the 
weakness of the defendant's."
[24]




The Court held in 
Galeno
 that the respondent therein did not 
present any competent evidence to prove the true and correct area of the
 subject property therein to warrant a correction of said respondent's 
certificate of title, and it dismissed the petition filed by said 
respondent.



 




The above pronouncements of the Court in 
Galeno
 are equally applicable in the instant case. The 
First
 and 
Second

 Reports of the LRA as well as the certifications of the DENR and the RD
 do not fall within the class of public documents under Section 23, Rule
 132 of the Rules since they do not reflect entries in public records 
made in the performance of a duty by a public officer, are not certified
 copies or authenticated reproductions of original official records in 
the legal custody of a government office, and are not even records of 
public documents. As such, without the testimonies of the public 
officers who issued respondent's documentary evidence or were the 
official custodians thereof to confirm the veracity of their contents or
 the existence of the original in their custody and those presented in 
court are faithful reproductions of the original, they are bereft of 
probative value and cannot, by their mere issuance, prove the facts 
stated therein.



In fact, the contents of the LRA Reports as well as the DENR and the RD 
certifications are hearsay because respondent's sole witness and 
attorney-in-fact, Esmeraldo, was incompetent to testify on the veracity 
of their contents, as he did not prepare any of the certifications or 
reports nor was he the public officer of the concerned government 
agencies, who was the custodian of the documents adverted to in the 
certifications and reports or who had personal knowledge of their 
contents.



While it is true that the public prosecutor who represented petitioner 
interposed no objection to the admission of the said documents in the 
proceedings before the RTC, hearsay evidence, whether objected to or 
not, has no probative value unless the proponent can show that the 
evidence falls within the accepted exceptions to the hearsay rule, which
 do not obtain in the instant case. While respondent's documentary 
evidence may have been admitted due to petitioner's lack of objection, 
it does not, however, mean that said documentary evidence should be 
accorded any probative weight. Besides, as reiterated by the Court in 
Galeno
,
 the State cannot be estopped by the omission, mistake or error of its 
officials or agents, especially when the decision granting the petition 
for reconstitution has no merit on the basis of the law and the evidence
 on record. Moreover, in reconstitution of title cases, the party having
 the burden of proof must produce clear and convincing evidence.
[25]



Since the pieces of documentary evidence, which purportedly emanated 
from the LRA, DENR and RD, have no probative value, being hearsay, there
 is no competent evidence to support respondent's petition for 
reconstitution. Therefore, his petition should be dismissed.



The Court has stressed in 
Republic v. Sanchez
[26]
 (
Sanchez
)
 that the LRA report is an indispensable requirement in the 
reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificates of title pursuant to 
LRA Circular No. 35 and the Court's Administrative Circular No. 7-96, 
viz
.:


Contrary to the Court of Appeals' finding, the Second Report
 is not a "collateral attack" on TCT No. 252708. Circular No. 35 
requires the submission of an LRA Report in all proceedings to 
judicially reconstitute lost or destroyed Torrens certificates of title.
[27]

 Indeed, to "x x x prevent duplication of titles, x x x and [the] 
irregular reconstitution of lost or destroyed land certificates of title
 based on unauthorized sources," this Court issued Administrative 
Circular No. 7-96 ("Circular 7-96") on 15 July 1996 reminding trial 
court judges and clerks of courts "under pain of disciplinary sanctions,
 x x x to comply strictly" with, among others, Circular No. 35. Trial 
courts hearing reconstitution petitions under RA 26 are thus duty-bound 
to take into account the LRA's Report. When the trial court considered 
the authentic Second Report in issuing the 17 July 1998 Resolution, it 
merely complied with Circular 7-96.


True, petitioner submitted the Second Report after the period to appeal,
 or seek relief against, the 28 October 1996 Order had lapsed. However, 
this is no bar for the trial court to consider the Second Report. 
Petitioner was not at fault when it did not submit its Report before the
 trial court resolved LRC Case No. Q-96-8296. Petitioner explained that 
respondents failed to submit the documents petitioner had requested in 
its letter of 6 August 1996. But more than this, courts have inherent 
power to correct fatal infirmities in its proceedings, especially if, as
 here, the flaw was intentionally brought about by a party who employed 
deceit in misleading the trial court.
[28]

 To hold otherwise would render courts helpless in maintaining the 
integrity of its proceedings and correspondingly embolden parties to 
make a mockery of judicial rules. The trial court merely exercised such 
inherent power in the higher interest of justice.
[29]



Since the 
First
 and 
Second
 Reports of the LRA have no 
probative value, the dismissal of the petition for reconstitution is in 
order for the failure of the RTC to comply with the directive to require
 the LRA to submit its report and to require the attendance of the 
responsible LRA official, under pain of contempt, to authenticate and 
testify on the report, especially in this case where there is apparent 
conflict between the Reports submitted by the LRA. As observed by the 
Court in the aforequoted 
Sanchez
, the trial court has the inherent power to control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice,
[30]
 and such inherent power of control is enforceable by its power of contempt.



Also, LRA Circular No. 35 requires that the RD shall submit "written 
findings" of the status of the title sought to be reconstituted. Again, 
in 
Sanchez
, the Court stated that a mere certification that the 
original TCT was among those destroyed in a particular fire is 
insufficient, 
viz
.:


x x x Paragraph 12 of Circular No. 35 requires that the 
Register of Deeds shall submit "written findings" on the status of the 
title sought to be reconstituted. No such "written findings" exist in 
the records of this case. What respondents submitted was a Certification
 dated 14 December 1994 that the original of TCT No. 252708 was among 
those destroyed in the 1988 fire. This falls short of what paragraph 12 
of Circular 35 requires.
[31]



Thus, the RD Certification: "THE PROVINCIAL CAPITOL BUILDING IN CAVITE 
CITY WAS RAZED TO THE GROUND [O]N JUNE 7, 1959 HOUSING THE OFFICE OF THE
 REGISTER OF DEEDS"
[32]
 
clearly falls short of the LRA Circular No. 35 requirement. This is 
further ground to dismiss respondent's petition for reconstitution.



Moreover, the Court is convinced that the existence of the conflicting 
First
 and 
Second

 Reports of the LRA, assuming them to be authentic and with probative 
value, is sufficient proof that respondent has not adduced clear and 
convincing evidence to sustain his petition for reconstitution. The 
First

 Report, if its contents are to be believed, cast serious doubt on the 
authenticity of respondent's owner's duplicate TCTs, to wit:


2. Examination and verification of the photocopies of TCT 
Nos. T-4773 and T-2822 reveal the following observations/findings[,] to 
wit:


2.1 It appears on both titles that the same were issued under LRC Record
 No. 53673 pursuant to Decree No. 754698 in the Registry of Deeds of 
Cavite. Verification of our records, however, reveals that LRC Record 
No. 53673 was issued Decree No. 
717402
 for a parcel of land situated in 
Batangas City
.


2.2 Lots 1131 and 1132 Cad. 285 of Carmona, Cavite were embraced in Cad.
 Case 12, Cad. Rec. No. 2166, however, no Cadastral Book is on file at 
the Cadastral Decree Section, this Authority. Both lots when plotted on 
MIS G321 appear to be equivalent of Lots 1 & 2, respectively, of 
Plan Psu-108561, GLRO Rec. No. 14623[.]


3. From the foregoing, it appears that both titles did not exist in the 
Registry of Deeds of Cavite, because the information contained therein 
are not in accordance with our records.
[33]



The 
First
 Report plainly indicates that, upon verification of the
 LRA records, Decree No. 717402, not Decree No. 754698 (the one 
appearing on the purported owner's duplicate TCTs in Fel's name), was 
issued in LRC Record No. 53673, and said Decree covered a parcel of land
 situated in Batangas City, not Cavite. Since said Decree covered land 
located in Batangas City, the 
First
 Report concluded that the 
purported two TCTs in Fel's name, which are the subject of the 
reconstitution petition, could not have existed in the RD.



The plain text of the 
First
 Report of the LRA already puts in 
serious doubt the veracity and authenticity of Fel's purported TCTs. And
 such doubt has not been erased by the issuance of the 
Second
 Report because the latter was silent on the questionable Decree from which the purported TCTs of Fel emanated or originated.



The 
Second
 Report did not correct the 
First
 Report as erroneously found by the CA.
[34]
 The 
Second
 Report, on the assumption that it has probative value and its contents are true, made the following purported findings:


The technical descriptions of Lots 1131 & 1132, both of 
the Cadastral Survey of Carmona, Cad. 285, situated in the Municipality 
of Carmona, Province of Cavite, appearing on the reproductions of 
owner's duplicates of Transfer Certificate[s] of Title Nos. T-4773 and 
T-2822 were found correct after examination and due computation. Said 
technical descriptions when plotted on Municipal Index Sheet No. G321, 
do not appear to overlap previously plotted/decreed properties in the 
aforesaid area.
[35]



The foregoing is even consistent with 2.2 of the 
First
 Report, although the pertinent Cadastral Book was not on file in the LRA's Cadastral Decree Section, to wit:


2.2. Lots 1131 and 1132 Cad. 285 of Carmona, Cavite were 
embraced in Cad. Case 12, Cad. Rec. No. 2166, however, no Cadastral Book
 is on file at the Cadastral Decree Section, this Authority. Both lots 
when plotted on MIS G321 appear to be equivalent of Lots 1 & 2, 
respectively, of Plan Psu-108561, GLRO Rec. No. 14623[.]
[36]



The 
Second
 Report did not confirm the existence of the 
certificates of title sought to be reconstituted but merely attested to 
the correctness of the technical descriptions stated therein and when 
plotted on said municipal index sheet, the technical descriptions did 
not appear to overlap previously plotted or decreed properties in the 
area. Such technical descriptions may subsequently be used as basis for 
the inscription of the technical descriptions in the reconstituted 
titles, but they do not prove the prior valid existence of respondent's 
TCTs. This is consistent with the observation made by the Court in 
Republic v. Tuastumban
,
[37]
 to wit:


x x x The Blue Print of Advance Plan and Technical 
Description of Lot No. 7129 also do not prove the prior valid existence 
of the certificate of title as they are mere descriptions of Lot 7129. 
The LRA report also does not confirm the existence of the certificate of
 title but merely attests to the correctness of the plan and technical 
description which may subsequently be used as basis for the inscription 
of the technical description in the reconstituted title. x x x
[38]



Thus, the conclusion of the CA - "The existence of the 
Second
 
Report did not in any way impair the authenticity of [respondent's] 
duplicate cop[ies] of the subject TCTs, but in fact buttressed the same"
[39]
 - proceeds from a misapprehension of the contents thereof, assuming them to be correct.



Since the 
Second
 Report merely deals with the correctness of the 
technical descriptions reflected in respondent's duplicate TCTs, the 
findings of the LRA in the 
First
 Report that: (1) the inscription
 in both titles that they were issued under LRC Record No. 53673 
pursuant to Decree No. 754698 in the RD does not correspond to the 
records of the LRA because, upon verification of its records, LRC Record
 No. 53673 was issued Decree No. 717402 for a parcel of land situated in
 Batangas City; and (2) both titles did not exist in the RD because the 
information contained therein are not in accordance with the records of 
the LRA, remain unrebutted by the 
Second
 Report.



Given this apparent conflict in the LRA Reports, it behooved the RTC to 
require an explanation from the responsible LRA official and to totally 
discard them in the absence of such explanation or in case that it was 
not satisfied therewith.



Since the 
First
 Report of the LRA, assuming the same to be 
authentic and with probative value, puts in serious doubt the 
authenticity of respondent's owner's duplicate TCTs, the OSG correctly 
pointed out that the petition for reconstitution falls under Section 
3(f) and not Section 3(a) of Republic Act (RA) No. 26,
[40]

 and non-compliance with the requirements under Section 13 in relation 
to Section 12 of RA No. 26 for the petition for reconstitution under 
Section 3(f) ousted the RTC of its jurisdiction over the case, thereby 
rendering the latter's Decision a nullity.
[41]



RA No. 26 is the law governing the reconstitution of lost or destroyed 
Torrens certificates of title. Section 3 of RA No. 26 provides:


SECTION 3. Transfer certificates of title shall be 
reconstituted from such of the sources hereunder enumerated as may be 
available, in the following order:


(a) The owner's duplicate of the certificate of title;


(b) The co-owner's, mortgagee's, or lessee's duplicate of the certificate of title;


(c) A certified copy of the certificate of title, previously issued by the register of deeds or by a legal custodian thereof;


(d) The deed of transfer or other document. on file in the registry of 
deeds, containing the description of the property, or an authenticated 
copy thereof, showing that its original had been registered, and 
pursuant to which the lost or destroyed transfer certificate of title 
was issued;


(e) A document, on file in the registry of deeds, by which the property,
 the description of which is given in said document, is mortgaged, 
leased or encumbered, or an authenticated copy of said document showing 
that its original had been registered; and


(f) Any other document which, in the judgment of the court, is 
sufficient and proper basis for reconstituting the lost or destroyed 
certificate of title.







 




The general jurisdictional requirements are provided in Section 9 of RA No. 26, to wit:


SECTION 9. A registered owner desiring to have his 
reconstituted certificate of title freed from the encumbrance mentioned 
in section seven of this Act, may file a petition to that end with the 
proper Court of First Instance, giving his reason or reasons therefor. A
 similar petition may, likewise, be filed by a mortgagee, lessees or 
other lien holder whose interest is annotated in the reconstituted 
certificate of title. Thereupon, the court shall cause a notice of the 
petition to be published, at the expense of the petitioner, twice in 
successive issues of the 
Official Gazette
, and to be posted on 
the main entrance of the provincial building and of the municipal 
building of the municipality or city in which the land lies, at least 
thirty days prior to the date of hearing, and after hearing, shall 
determine the petition and render such judgment as justice and equity 
may require. The notice shall specify, among other things, the number of
 the certificate of title, the name of the registered owner, the names 
of the interested parties appearing in the reconstituted certificate of 
title, the location of the property, and the date on which all persons 
having an interest in the property must appear and file such claim as 
they may have. The petitioner shall, at the hearing, submit proof of the
 publication and posting of the notice: 
Provided, however
, That 
after the expiration of two years from the date of the reconstitution of
 a certificate of title, if no petition has been filed within that 
period under the preceding section, the court shall, on motion 
ex parte

 by the registered owner or other person having registered interest in 
the reconstituted certificate of title, order the register of deeds to 
cancel, proper annotation, the [e]ncumbrance mentioned in section seven 
hereof.



For petitions for TCT reconstitution under Section 3(a) and/or Section 
3(b), Section 10 of RA No. 26 must be also observed, to wit:


SECTION 10. Nothing hereinbefore provided shall prevent any 
registered owner or person in interest from filing the petition 
mentioned in section five of this Act directly with the proper Court of 
First Instance, based on sources enumerated in sections 2(a), 2(b), 
3(a), 3(b), and/or 4(a) of this Act: 
Provided, however
, That the 
court shall cause a notice of the petition, before hearing and granting 
the same, to be published in the manner stated in section nine hereof: 
And provided, further
,
 That certificates of title reconstituted pursuant to this section shall
 not be subject to the encumbrance referred to in section seven of this 
Act.



For petitions for TCT reconstitution based on Section 3(c), 3(d), 3(e) 
and/or 3(f), Sections 12 and 13 of RA No. 26, which are also 
jurisdictional requirements, provide:


SECTION 12. Petitions for reconstitution from sources 
enumerated in sections 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), 2(f), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e) and/or 
3(f) of this Act, shall be filed with the proper Court of First 
Instance, by the registered owner, his assigns, or any person having an 
interest in the property. The petition shall state or contain, among 
other things, the following: (a) that the owner's duplicate of the 
certificate of title had been lost or destroyed; (b) that no co-owner's,
 mortgagee's or lessee's duplicate had been issued, or, if any had been 
issued, the same had been lost or destroyed; (c) the location, area and 
boundaries of the property; (d) the nature and description of the 
buildings or improvements, if any, which do not belong to the owner of 
the land, and the names and addresses of the owners of such buildings or
 improvements; (e) the names and addresses of the occupants or persons 
in possession of the property, of the owners of the adjoining properties
 and all persons who may have any interest in the property; (f) a 
detailed description of the encumbrances, if any, affecting the 
property; and (g) a statement that no deeds or other instruments 
affecting the property have been presented for registration, or, if 
there be any, the registration thereof has not been accomplished, as 
yet. All the documents, or authenticated copies thereof, to be 
introduced in evidence in support of the petition for reconstitution 
shall be attached thereto and filed with the same: 
Provided
, That
 in case the reconstitution is to be made exclusively from sources 
enumerated in section 2(f) or 3(f) of this Act, the petition shall be 
further be accompanied with a plan and technical description of the 
property duly approved by the Chief of the General Land Registration 
Office, or with a certified copy of the description taken from a prior 
certificate of title covering the same property.


SECTION 13. The court shall cause a notice of the petition, filed under 
the preceding section, to be published, at the expense of the 
petitioner, twice in successive issues of the 
Official Gazette
, 
and to be posted on the main entrance of the provincial building and of 
the municipal building of the municipality or city in which the land is 
situated, at least thirty days prior to the date of hearing. The court 
shall likewise cause a copy of the notice to be sent, by registered mail
 or otherwise, at the expense of the petitioner, to every person named 
therein whose address is known, at least thirty days prior to the date 
of hearing. Said notice shall state, among other things, the number of 
the lost or destroyed certificate of title, if known, the name of the 
registered owner, the names of the occupants or persons in possession of
 the property, the owners of the adjoining properties and all other 
interested parties, the location, area and boundaries of the property, 
and the date on which all persons having any interest therein must 
appear and file their claim or objections to the petition. The 
petitioner shall, at the hearing, submit proof of the publication, 
posting and service of the notice as directed by the court.



Given the different legal requirements depending upon the source of the TCT reconstitution, the Court observed in 
Republic v. Susi
:
[42]


The judicial reconstitution of a Torrens title under RA 26 
means the restoration in the original form and condition of a lost or 
destroyed Torrens certificate attesting the title of a person to 
registered land. The purpose of the reconstitution is to enable, 
after observing the procedures prescribed by law
,
 the reproduction of the lost or destroyed Torrens certificate in the 
same form and in exactly the same way it was at the time of the loss or 
destruction.


RA 26 provides two procedures and sets of requirements in the 
reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificates of title depending on 
the 
source
 of the petition for reconstitution. Section 10 in 
relation to Section 9 provides the procedure and requirements for 
sources falling under Sections 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3 (b), and 4(a). On the
 other hand, Sections 12 and 13 lay down the procedure and requirements 
for sources falling under Sections 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), 2(f), 3(c), 3(d), 
3(e), and 3(f). Thus, before the court can properly act, assume, and 
acquire jurisdiction or authority over the petition and grant the 
reconstitution prayed for, petitioner must observe the above procedures 
and requirements prescribed by the law.


In numerous cases, the Court has held that the noncompliance with the 
prescribed procedure and requirements deprives the trial court of 
jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the case and, 
consequently, all its proceedings are rendered null and void. The 
rationale underlying this rule concerns the nature of the conferment in 
the trial court of the authority to undertake reconstitution 
proceedings. In all cases where the authority to proceed is conferred by
 a statute and the manner of obtaining jurisdiction is mandatory, the 
same must be strictly complied with, or the proceedings will be utterly 
void. As such, the court upon which the reconstitution petition is filed
 is duty-bound to examine thoroughly the same, and review the record and
 the legal provisions laying down the germane jurisdictional 
requirements.


x x x x


In cases where the LRA challenges the authenticity of the applicant's
 purported owner's duplicate certificate of title, the reconstitution 
petition should be treated as falling under Section 3(f) of RA 26, and 
the trial court should require compliance with the requisites under 
Sections 12 and 13 of RA 26.


In particular, the reconstitution petition and the published and posted 
notice of hearing in compliance with the October 13, 2005 Order failed 
to show that notices were sent to the other occupants, possessors, and 
persons who may have an interest in, or who have buildings or 
improvements on the land covered by the certificate of title sought to 
be reconstituted, as well as the owners of adjoining properties.


Jurisprudence is replete with cases underscoring the indispensability of 
actual
 and personal notice of the date of hearing of the reconstitution 
petition to actual owners and possessors of the land involved in order 
to vest the trial court with jurisdiction
 thereon. If no notice of 
the date of hearing of a reconstitution case is served on a possessor or
 one having interest in the property involved, he is deprived of his day
 in court and the order of reconstitution is null and void.


Thus, in light of the LRA's report of the subsistence of other 
certificates of title over the subject land, it behooved the RTC to 
notify the registered land owners of the reconstitution proceedings, in 
observance of diligence and prudence; however, it failed to act 
accordingly. But more than this, courts have the inherent power to 
correct fatal infirmities in its proceedings in order to maintain the 
integrity thereof.


In view of the failure to comply with the requirements of Sections 12 
and 13 of RA 26, particularly, on the service of notices of hearing on 
the registered owners and/or actual possessors of the land subject of 
the reconstitution case, the RTC, did not acquire jurisdiction over the 
case, and all proceedings held thereon are null and void. That being 
said, the Court finds it unnecessary to delve on the other matters 
raised in the petition.
[43]
 (Emphasis in the original)




Consequently, if the conflicting LRA Reports are accorded any probative value and given that the 
First

 Report challenges the authenticity of respondent's purported owner's 
duplicate TCTs, the reconstitution petition should have been treated as 
one falling under Section 3(f) of RA No. 26 and the RTC should have 
required respondent to comply with the requisites under Sections 12 and 
13 of RA No. 26. Since respondent did not comply therewith, the petition
 for reconstitution should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.



As a final note, the Court is perplexed why it was only in March 2014 
that the petition for reconstitution was filed by respondent. Based on 
the copies of the TCTs sought to be reconstituted, they were supposedly 
issued on August 1, 1952
[44]
 and June 11, 1956
[45]

 when Fel was still single. The fire which razed the RD happened in 
1959. Fel allegedly died on June 25, 1997, but apparently no petition 
for reconstitution was filed by him. From 1959 when the purported 
destruction by fire of the purported original TCTs, it took respondent 
around 55 years to file the reconstitution petition. The Court expects a
 credible explanation from respondent.
