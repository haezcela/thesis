LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case


 This petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 seeks to reverse the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104111, entitled 
In
 the Matter of the Petition for the Probate of the Last Will and 
Testament of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico â Thelma Esguerra Guia v. Jose M. 
Cosico, Jr., Manuel M. Cosico, Minerva M. Cosico, and Eleanor M. 
Cosico-Chavez
:
  






1.


Decision
[2]

 dated December 7, 2018, reversing the Decision of the Regional Trial 
Court (RTC)-Br.32, San Pablo City which admitted to probate Cecilia 
Esguerra Cosico's last will and testament; and














2.


Resolution
[3]
 dated May 8, 2019, denying reconsideration.






Antecedents




 Cecilia Esguerra Cosico (Cecilia) was born in 1932 to Jose Cosico,
 Sr. and Corazon Esguerra (Corazon). She was born with a physical 
disability and was known in the locality as a "
lumpo
." Corazon 
passed away when Cecilia was just one (1) year old and the latter was 
left in the care and custody of her maternal aunt, Mercedes Esguerra 
Guia (Mercedes). Mercedes raised Cecilia in their home in Schetilig 
Avenue, San Pablo City, together with Mercedes's legally adopted 
daughter, petitioner Thelma Esguerra Guia (Thelma). Because of her 
physical condition, Cecilia spent most of her days in her bedroom. She 
never attended school nor learned to read or write.
[4]
 In 1996, when she was sixty-four (64) years old, Cecilia decided to execute her last will and testament. Through Thelma's 
balae

 Liberato B. Benedictos (Liberato), Cecilia asked Atty. Danton Q. 
Bueser, then a notary public (now a retired Associate Justice of the 
Court of Appeals), for assistance in preparing the last will.
[5]
 For the purpose of this case though, we shall refer to him as Atty. Bueser.

 On September 8, 1996, Atty. Bueser and Liberato went to Cecilia's 
house. Atty. Bueser and Cecilia talked inside the latter's bedroom while
 Liberato stayed outside by the door. Liberato heard Cecilia call 
Mercedes whom she directed to collect documents from the steel cabinet. 
Mercedes complied and handed over the documents to Atty. Bueser.
[6]

 On September 10, 1996, Atty. Bueser and Liberato returned to Cecilia's 
house with the finished copy of her last will and testament denominated 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 which consisted of four (4) pages, 
viz
.:

 Reynaldo M. Gigante (Reynaldo) and Ricardo C. Pandino (Ricardo) 
were also present at Cecilia's house that night upon her request. 
Reynaldo was the son of Cecilia's helper, while Ricardo was a neighbor 
who regularly went to the house to buy coconuts from Mercedes.
[7]
 In the presence of Liberato, Reynaldo, and Ricardo who served as notarial witnesses to Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
,
 Atty. Bueser read the contents of the document to Cecilia and carefully
 explained to her its effects and consequences. He then asked her if she
 fully understood its contents and whether it was done according to her 
wishes. Cecilia confirmed.
[8]
 After Atty. Bueser read and explained the contents of the
 Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
,
 Cecilia affixed her thumbmark to the will on top of her printed name 
and on the lower left portion of the first and second pages of the 
document â all in the presence of Atty. Bueser and her notarial 
witnesses. Subsequently, in the presence of Liberato, Reynaldo, and 
Ricardo, both Cecilia and Atty. Bueser signed on the left margin of the 
first two pages of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 and at the end of the attestation clause.
[9]
 After all the preparations, Atty. Bueser handed over the signed copy of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 to Cecilia.
[10]


 On March 22, 2006, Cecilia died at the age of seventy-four (74). Following her death, Mercedes obtained a copy of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
, had it photocopied and gave her spouse Gomerciendo Guia and Thelma a copy each. 
[11]


 On May 9, 2009, Mercedes died.
[12]

 On July 6, 2010, Thelma filed a Petition for probate of Cecilia's will 
and for her appointment as administrator of the latter's estate before 
the Regional Trial Court (RTC)-Br. 32, San Pablo City.
[13]

 On September 23, 2010, Cecilia's half siblings from the same father, 
respondents Jose. M. Cosico, Jr., Manuel M. Cosico, Minerva M. Cosico, 
and Eleanor M. Cosico-Chavez (respondents) opposed the petition.
[14]

 They essentially alleged that the formalities for the execution of a 
valid will under Articles 805 to 809 of the Civil Code were not complied
 with. More, Cecilia was not mentally capacitated at the time she 
purportedly executed her will; if at all, she signed it under duress and
 improper pressure from the beneficiary; the alleged thumbprint of 
Cecilia was procured through fraud; and Cecilia did not intend the 
document denominated 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 to be her last will and testament.
[15]


 On October 28, 2010, Batubalani Realty and Development 
Corporation (Batubalani) moved for leave to intervene, claiming it had 
interest in Cecilia's properties. During their lifetime, Cecilia and 
Mercedes supposedly entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with it
 on August 5, 1998. Under this Agreement, Batubalani developed a 
subdivision project covering 35,000 square meters of land owned by 
Cecilia and Mercedes. Batubalani then sold the developed lots. The 
proceeds were shared by the company, Cecilia, and Mercedes. In 
connection with the Agreement, Cecilia and Mercedes registered the 
parcels of land in their names under one title, Original Certificate of 
Title No. 0-861.
[16]
 
Through Order dated November 26, 2010, the trial court granted the 
motion to intervene. It also noted the stipulations entered into by the 
parties at the pre-trial, thus:
[17]
 a.) Cecilia died on March 22, 2006; b.) She died without compulsory heirs; and c.) Mercedes had already passed away.
[18]

 Meantime, by Order dated August 8, 2011, the trial court appointed 
Atty. Gerardo Iligan (Atty. Iligan) as Special Administrator of 
Cecilia's estate. Pursuant to his powers and duties as special 
administrator, Atty. Iligan secured and received copies of all deeds of 
conditional sale and expenses incurred relating to Cecilia's properties 
under the JVA. He also rendered accounting of those lots yet unsold. As 
it turned out, the 35,000-square meter parcel of land subject of the JVA
 was subdivided into 200 smaller lots covered by several transfer 
certificates in the names of Cecilia and Mercedes. Of the 200 smaller 
lots, 167 were put up for sale, 60 of which had already been sold, while
 the rest were roads and open spaces. Consequently, Atty. Iligan 
prepared a Segregation Agreement with Thelma where they agreed to assign
 53 parcels of land to Mercedes and the 54 unsold lots to Cecilia. 
Thereafter, they jointly moved for its approval.
[19]
 
 
The Regional Trial Court's Decision
 By Decision dated June 30, 2014,
[20]
 the trial court granted the Special Administrator's Motion for Segregation and admitted Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 to probate, 
viz
.:
  


 As it is, the Segregation Agreement was executed between the 
Special Administrator and the petitioner who is the named substitute 
executor and heir to the estate of Cecilia pursuant to the (sic) 
Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
. The petitioner is also
 the only heir of Mercedes who is part owner of the lot covered by 
Original Certificate of Title No. 0-861, which was subdivided into 
several lots sold to third parties pursuant to the Joint Venture 
Agreement entered into between the intervenor Batubalani Realty 
Development Corporation, on the one hand, and Cecilia and Mercedes, on 
the other. In short, then, petitioner Thelma Esguerra Guia Esteva is 
bound to be the only owner, not only of the share of Mercedes in the lot
 covered by OCT No. 0-861, but also of the share of Cecilia in the same 
lot, including all other properties of Cecilia mentioned in the latter's
 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
.


 This Court thus 
grants the Special Administrator's Motion for Segregation. The Segregation Agreement is hereby approved.

 After all, with the probate of Cecilia's Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya,
 the petitioner shall remain the sole executor and heir to the estate of
 Cecilia pursuant to the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
, as well as the sole heir to Mercedes. (Emphasis supplied) 
 
    x x x x


 
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the last will and 
testament of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico, contained in her Huling Habilin at
 Pagpapasiya executed on September 10, 1996 is hereby ADMITTED to 
probate. 


 Letters testamentary and/or administration are hereby issued in 
favor of Thelma Esguerra Guia Estiva without posing any bond. In 
accordance with the Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya of Cecilia Esguerra 
Cosico, Thelma Esguerra Guia Estiva shall be the executor of, and the 
sole heir, to the estate of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico. 


 Within three (3) months after her appointment as executor or 
administrator, Thelma Esguerra Guia Estiva is directed to submit a true 
inventory and appraisal of all the real and personal estate of Cecilia 
Esguerra Cosico. She may secure the services of a tax appraiser in the 
appraisement of the estate. 


 Thelma Esguerra Guia Estiva is also directed to pay Atty. 
Gerardo B. Ilagan his compensation as Special Administrator, and all 
proper expenses of administration incurred by him, chargeable against 
the estate, pursuant to Section 7, Rule 85 of the Rules of Court. 


 Let a notice be issued to any and all persons who have money 
claims against Cecilia Esguerra Cosico and her estate to file their 
claim before the Office of the Clerk of Court of this Court. This notice
 shall be published for three (3) consecutive weeks successively in a 
newspaper of general publication in the Province of Laguna and in San 
Pablo City, and shall be posted for the same period in four public 
places in the province and in two public places in the City of San Pablo
 where Cecilia Esguerra Cosico last resided. Such money claims against 
the estate of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico shall be filed with the Office of 
the Clerk of Court within a period of not more than twelve (12) months 
nor less than six (6) months after the date of the first publication of 
the notice. 


 
 SO ORDERED.
[21]
 




 The trial court essentially ruled that Cecilia freely and 
voluntarily executed the will, during which time, she was of sound mind.
[22]
 The 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya 
was executed in accordance with the formal and essential requisites of law.
[23]

 The court had the power to act on the Special Administrator's Motion to
 Approve the Segregation Agreement. It further noted that while 
respondents were blood relatives of Cecilia, it was not unnatural for 
her to have bequeathed all her properties to Mercedes since it was 
Mercedes who took care of her throughout her lifetime and provided her 
comfort up to her last breath.
[24]
 
 While she was considered a 
lumpo
,
 Cecilia knew fully well the nature of her properties to be disposed of,
 the proper subjects of her bounty, and the character of her 
testamentary act. To be sure, her 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 was not prepared all in one day, but was actually a product of a prior 
conference and discussion with Atty. Bueser two (2) nights before the 
signing and final execution thereof; the respective testimonies of 
Reynaldo and Liberato corroborated each other on Cecilia's sound mental 
condition; and at any rate, respondents failed to rebut the presumption 
that every person is of sound mind, as they had in fact waived their 
right to adduce evidence to support their opposition; finally, nowhere 
was it shown that Mercedes or Thelma pressured or duly influenced 
Cecilia into executing her 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
.
[25]


 The 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 complied with the 
formal and essential requirements of the Civil Code: (1) Cecilia was of 
sound mind when she had it prepared and executed; (2) it was written in 
Filipino, a language known to Cecilia; (3) Cecilia subscribed to it by 
affixing her thumbmark thereto; (4) it was attested and subscribed by 
three (3) credible witnesses in the presence of Cecilia and of one 
another.
[26]


 The trial court did not give merit to respondents' argument that the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 was supposedly fatally defective for not having been read twice: once, 
by one of the subscribing witnesses; and again by the notary public 
before whom it was acknowledged in view of Cecilia's illiteracy. It 
considered the following reasons to have rendered the requirement 
superfluous: (1) Cecilia herself discussed and dictated the terms by 
which she wanted to dispose of her properties with Atty. Bueser two (2) 
days before subscribing to the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
; (2) on the day she affixed her thumbmark to the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
,
 its contents were read and carefully explained to Cecilia by Atty. 
Bueser; and (3) when Atty. Bueser asked Cecilia if she understood the 
contents of her 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
, she readily affixed her thumbmark thereto, signifying that its terms and contents were consistent with her wishes.
[27]


 
Finally
, the court explained that its approval of the Segregation Agreement was inevitable following the admission to probate of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 wherein Thelma stood to inherit all the properties of Mercedes, 
including those which Cecilia herself previously acquired as sole heir 
of Mercedes.
[28]


 On appeal, respondents faulted the trial court for admitting in probate Cecilia's will. They insisted that Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 did not comply with all the legal requirements under Articles 806
[29]
 and 808
[30]
 of the Civil Code. For one, Liberato and Reynaldo failed to declare or avow that their act of signing Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 was voluntary. For another, the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 was read to Cecilia only once by Atty. Bueser and lacked the second 
reading requirement by one of her notarial witnesses. Finally, the 
Special Administrator had no authority to enter into such a Segregation 
Agreement with Thelma.
[31]


 
The Court of Appeals' Decision
 By Decision
[32]
 dated December 7, 2018, the Court of Appeals reversed. It ruled that Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 was void since it violated Article 808 of the Civil Code, thus: 
  


 
WHEREFORE

 the petition for probate filed by the petitioner-appellee Thelma Esguerra Guia; and,

SO ORDERED.
 




 On one hand, it noted that the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 had substantially complied with Article 806. While respondents insisted
 that the notarial witnesses failed to make a declaration before the 
notary public that their acts of affixing their respective signatures 
were voluntary, this was easily refuted by the acknowledgment portion of
 the will, 
viz
.: 
  


 SA HARAPAN KO x x x ay dumulog si CECILIA ESGUERRA COSICO x x x 
Kilala ko na siya ang nagsagawa na naunang RULING HABILIN o TESTAMENTO, 
na kanyang isinagawa at nilagdaan sa harapan ng kanyang tatlong saksi na

pinatunayan nila na yaon ay kanilang nilagdaan at isinagawa nang malaya 
at kusa sa kanilang kalooban. 
(Emphasis supplied) 




 At any rate, there was no evidence showing that the notarial witnesses were forced or coerced into signing the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
.
[33]


 The Court of Appeals nevertheless ruled that as for Article 808, the same was not observed during the execution of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
.
 While it is strictly a requirement for blind testators, jurisprudence 
has, by analogy, applied the requirement of reading the will 
twice
:
 once, by one of the instrumental witnesses and, again, by the notary 
public before whom the will was acknowledged to those who, for one 
reason or another, are "incapable of reading their wills."
[34]


 It emphasized the rationale behind Article 808 â to make the 
provisions in the will known to the testator and to allow him or her to 
object if they are not in accordance to his or her wishes. Having been 
read twice by different disinterested persons would ensure that the 
contents of the will are properly communicated and understood by the 
testator.
[35]
 
 Here, it
 was undisputed that Cecilia never learned how to read and write, hence 
she was an illiterate; and it was only the notary public, Atty. Bueser, 
who read the will to the testator Cecilia. Thus, the will should not 
have been admitted to probate for violation of Article 808.
[36]
 

 It became wholly immaterial that Cecilia had full possession of her 
reasoning faculties; and clear knowledge of the nature of her estate, 
the proper objects of her bounty, and the character of her testamentary 
act. For the breach of Article 808 had actually exposed Cecilia's will 
to the possibility of fraud. In other words, even if Cecilia had 
fulfilled the aforesaid requirements, there is no guarantee that the 
will which was "read" to her was the same document which she and the 
notarial witnesses signed.
[37]
 
 Finally, the Court of Appeals ruled that Thelma could not invoke 
In re: Alvarado v. Gaviola, Jr.
[38]
 for the purpose of claiming substantial compliance with Article 808. In 
Alvarado
,
 the Court held that there was substantial compliance with Article 808 
because the notary public and the notarial witnesses had their own copy 
of the will and read the same silently while the lawyer read it out 
loud. In contrast, none of the notarial witnesses here were given copy 
of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
. As such, they could not have confirmed the contents of the document read and explained by Atty. Bueser to Cecilia.
[39]


 With the disallowance of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 to probate, the Segregation Agreement becomes devoid of basis. As such,
 Cecilia's properties should be passed on to her heirs by intestate 
succession under Article 960
[40]
 in relation to Articles 1003
[41]
 and 1007
[42]
 of the Civil Code.
  
 The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration on May 8, 2019.
[43]
 
 
Present Petition


 Thelma now asks the Court to exercise its discretionary 
appellate jurisdiction to review and reverse the assailed issuances of 
the Court of Appeals.
[44]
 
 She faults the Court of Appeals for ruling that Article 808 was not substantially complied with insofar as the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 
is concerned
 and that 
Alvarado

 was inapplicable here; for disallowing probate of the will; and for 
denying the motion to approve the Segregation Agreement. Thelma asserts 
that there was more than substantial compliance with Article 808, as 
correctly ruled by the trial court in its Decision dated June 30, 2014.
[45]

 There is substantial compliance so long as the spirit of the law was 
served, even though the letter of the law was not. Formal imperfections 
may be overlooked when they do not affect the rationale behind the 
requirement.
[46]


 She argues anew that although Cecilia was a 
lumpo
 and 
did not have any formal education, she had full possession of her 
faculties when she executed her last will. She too had clear knowledge 
of the nature of her estate to be disposed of, the proper objects of her
 bounty, and the character of her testamentary act. She requested 
Liberato to look for a lawyer to help her prepare her last will and 
testament two (2) days before its execution. Liberato spoke to Atty. 
Bueser who agreed to assist Cecilia prepare and execute her last will 
and testament. Atty. Bueser and Cecilia conferred and discussed the 
latter's wishes, which the former reduced in writing, observing the 
formalities of a will. Finally, on September 10, 1996, in the presence 
of the notarial witnesses, Atty. Bueser read and explained the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 to Cecilia, who then, affixed her thumbmark thereto. The notarial 
witnesses likewise each affixed their respective signatures to the 
document.
[47]


 It was not only the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 
that established Cecilia's wishes, but the testimonies of the notarial 
witnesses as well. They proved that Cecilia had desired for her 
properties to be bequeathed to her aunt Mercedes who took care of her 
throughout her lifetime and even provided comfort up to her last breath.
[48]


 In sum, the denial of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 simply because none of the notarial witnesses read the contents thereof out loud nor silently read their own copies like in 
Alvarado
 - would frustrate Cecilia's wishes and intentions.
[49]
 Consequently, the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 should be admitted to probate and the Segregation Agreement, approved.
[50]


 In their 
Comment
,
[51]

 respondents maintain that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that 
Article 808 was not complied with. For one, both Liberato and Reynaldo 
admitted that they did not read the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
, but merely relied on the explanation of Atty. Bueser â who himself did not testify.
[52]
  For another, 
Alvarado
 is not on all fours with the present case, hence, the doctrine of substantial compliance is inapplicable here.
[53]


 
Threshold Issues
 Was the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 executed in compliance with Article 808 of the Civil Code? 
  
 Should the Segregation Agreement be approved? 
 
Ruling


 We grant the petition. 
 Article 808 of the Civil Code 
requires that the contents of a last will and testament be read to the 
testator twice, once by one of the subscribing witnesses, and again, by 
the notary, 
viz
.: 
  


 Article 808. If the testator is blind, the will shall be read to
 him twice; once, by one of the subscribing witnesses, and again, by the
 notary public before whom the will is acknowledged. (n) 




 While the law imposes the requirement only when the testator is 
blind, the Court has expanded its coverage to those who are illiterate. 
Alvarado
 elucidates:
[54]




 The following pronouncement in 
Garcia vs. Vasquez
[55]
 provides an insight into the scope of the term "blindness" as used in Art. 808, to wit: 




 The rationale behind the requirement of reading the will to 
the testator if he is blind or incapable of reading the will himself 
(as when he is 
illiterate
),
 is to make the provisions thereof known to him, so that he may be able 
to object if they are not in accordance with his wishes
 . . .




 Clear from the foregoing is that 
Art. 808 applies not only to
 blind testators but also to those who, for one reason or another, are 
"incapable of reading the(ir) will(s)."
 xxx


 Article 808 requires that in case of testators like Brigido 
Alvarado, the will shall be read twice; once, by one of the instrumental
 witnesses and, again, by the notary public before whom the will was 
acknowledged. The purpose is to make known to the incapacitated testator
 the contents of the document before signing and to give him an 
opportunity to object if anything is contrary to his instructions. 




 Here, Cecilia was not blind but a 
lumpo
. The Court of 
Appeals nevertheless applied Article 808 of the Civil Code considering 
that Cecilia received no formal education and is incapable of reading or
 writing, hence, illiterate. Pursuant to 
Alvarado
, therefore, one of the subscribing witnesses should have read Cecilia the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 aside from Atty. Bueser. 
  
 We disagree. 
 Though 
Alvarado
 seemingly 
extended the application of Article 808 to cover not just the blind but 
also illiterates, the same case also recognized an exception to the rule
 â substantial compliance. We find this exception applicable here. 
 In 
Alvarado
,
 the testator was a 79-year old man who executed a notarial will, a 
subsequent holographic will, and later on, a codicil where he modified 
certain dispositions in the notarial will. As it was however, he was 
suffering from glaucoma, an eye condition which limited his functional 
vision "counting fingers at three (3) feet," preventing him from 
actually seeing for himself the contents of his own will. The Court thus
 ruled that such condition fell under the scope of Article 808, 
requiring the will to be read twice to the testator: once by the notary 
public, and another, by one of the notarial witnesses. Though this 
two-pronged requirement was not fulfilled, the Court nevertheless 
allowed the will probate on ground of substantial compliance, thus: 
  


 
This Court has held in a number of occasions that substantial
 compliance is acceptable where the purpose of the law has been 
satisfied, the reason being that the solemnities surrounding the 
execution of wills are intended 
to protect the testator from all 
kinds of fraud and trickery but are never intended to be so rigid and 
inflexible as to destroy the testamentary privilege.


 In the case at bar, private respondent read the testator's will 
and codicil aloud in the presence of the testator, his three 
instrumental witnesses, and the notary public. Prior and subsequent 
thereto, the testator affirmed, upon being asked, that the contents read
 corresponded with his instructions. Only then did the signing and 
acknowledgement take place. There is no evidence, and petitioner does 
not so allege, that the contents of the will and codicil were not 
sufficiently made known and communicated to the testator. On the 
contrary, with respect to the "Huling Habilin," the day of the execution
 was not the first time that Brigido had affirmed the truth and 
authenticity of the contents of the draft. The uncontradicted testimony 
of Atty. Rino is that Brigido Alvarado already acknowledged that the 
will was drafted in accordance with his expressed wishes even prior to 5
 November 1977 when Atty. Rino went to the testator's residence 
precisely for the purpose of securing his conformity to the draft. 


 Moreover, it was not only Atty. Rino who read the documents on 5
 November and 29 December 1977. The notary public and the three 
instrumental witnesses likewise read the will and codicil, albeit 
silently. Afterwards, Atty. Nonia de la Pena (the notary public) and Dr.
 Crescente O. Evidente (one of the three instrumental witnesses and the 
testator's physician) asked the testator whether the contents of the 
document were of his own free will. Brigido answered in the affirmative.
 With four persons following the reading word for word with their own 
copies, it can be safely concluded that the testator was reasonably 
assured that what was read to him (those which he affirmed were in 
accordance with his instructions), 
were the terms actually appearing on the typewritten documents.

 This is especially true when we consider the fact that the three 
instrumental witnesses were persons known to the testator, one being his
 physician (Dr. Evidente) and another (Potenciano C. Ranieses) being 
known to him since childhood. 


 
The spirit behind the law was served though the letter was 
not. Although there should be strict compliance with the substantial 
requirements of the law in order to insure the authenticity of the will,
 the 
formal imperfections should be brushed aside when they do not 
affect its purpose and which, when taken into account, may only defeat 
the testator's will.
 


 As a final word to convince petitioner of the propriety of the 
trial court's Probate Order and its affirmance by the Court of Appeals, 
we quote the following pronouncement in 
Abangan v. Abangan
,
[56]
 to wit: 




 
The object of the solemnities surrounding the execution of 
wills is to close the door against bad faith and fraud, to avoid the 
substitution of wills and testaments and to guaranty their truth and 
authenticity. Therefore the laws on the subject should be interpreted in
 such a way as to attain these primordial ends. 
But, on the other hand, 
also
 one must not lose sight of the fact that it is not the object of the 
law to restrain and curtail the exercise of the right to make a will. 
So
 when an interpretation already given assures such ends, any other 
interpretation whatsoever that adds nothing but demands more requisites 
entirely unnecessary, useless and frustrative of the testator's will, 
must be disregarded.




 Brigido Alvarado had expressed his last wishes in clear and 
unmistakable terms in his "Huling Habilin" and the codicil attached 
thereto. We are unwilling to cast these aside for the mere reason that a
 legal requirement intended for his protection was not followed strictly
 when such compliance had been rendered unnecessary by the fact that the
 purpose of the law, i.e., to make known to the incapacitated testator 
the contents of the draft of his will, had already been accomplished. To
 reiterate, substantial compliance suffices where the purpose has been 
served. (Emphases and underscoring supplied; Citations omitted) 




 Indeed, the purpose of a will is to grant the wishes of a person 
upon his/her death, especially with respect to the disposition of 
his/her worldly possessions.
[57]

 Both law and jurisprudence are consistent in allowing a degree of 
flexibility with the requirements in the execution of wills, especially 
as to the formal aspect.
[58]
 

 Here, we find that upholding respondents' position and the Court of 
Appeals' ruling would only frustrate Cecilia's will. A review of the 
document itself, the testimonies of the witnesses, and the record shows 
that like in 
Abangan
, as cited in 
Alvarado
, the intention of the testator had been established and protected from fraud or trickery. 
 Notably, Atty. Bueser 
read
 and 
explained
 the contents of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 to Cecilia. Meanwhile, Liberato and Reynaldo listened and understood 
the explanation of Atty. Bueser. It is also undisputed that Cecilia made
 no denial or correction to what she had heard. As such, we are 
convinced that the underlying protection of Article 808 had been 
fulfilled here. 
  
 At any rate, the Court refuses to entertain such a possibility
 of fraud because Atty. Bueser, aside from having observed all other 
formalities, handed copies of the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 to the notarial witnesses for their signatures. This gave them the 
opportunity to read a short four (4)-page document which they all 
flipped through from pages one (1) through four (4) to affix their 
respective signatures, essentially negating any possibility of fraud, 
trickery, or misrepresentation. 
  
 More, the notarial witnesses heard Atty. Bueser read and explain to Cecilia her 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 which gave both Cecilia and themselves the opportunity to object to any
 provision in the will that may not have been according to her wishes. 
As it was, no objections were made. To be sure, Reynaldo knew and 
understood Cecilia's testamentary act and disposition of her properties.
 He testified: 
  






Q


Mr. Witnesss, you said Atty. Danton Bueser explained the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapsiya

 to Cecilia Esguerra Cosico and you were present, if you can recall what
 is the most important content which was explained to her by Atty. 
Danton Bueser to the testator Cecilia Esguerra Cosico? 






A


 
Atty. Bueser explained that the properties owned by Cecilia Esguerra Cosico, if 
she will be leaving shall be given to the one taking care of her, sir.






 


 






Q


Who is that person who is taking care of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico?






A


Mercedes Guia, sir.
 






 


 






Q


What was the answer of Cecilia Esguerra
 Cosico after it was explained that all the properties shall be 
bequeathed or given to... based on the documents shall be given to 
Mercedes Guia? 






A


She agreed, sir.
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
[59]








Verily, Cecilia's 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 and 
Reynaldo's testimony are consistent on the most material point in the 
will that her properties shall be inherited by her aunt, Mercedes. 


 In sum, Article 808 is meant to protect the testator from all 
kinds of fraud and trickery but is never intended to be so rigid and 
inflexible as to destroy testamentary privilege. Here, the danger that 
Article 808 is designed to prevent is undoubtedly nonexistent. As such, 
the trial court correctly ruled that the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 had substantially complied with its spirit for the purpose of admitting it to probate. 
  
 As for the Segregation Agreement, we agree with the Court of 
Appeals that its approval has no basis, albeit on a different ground. 
For the trial court, acting as a probate court has limited jurisdiction,
 relating only to matters involving the probate of the will, i.e. the 
proceedings in determining the validity of a will. 
Aranas v. Mercado
[60]
 is instructive: 
  


 The probate court is authorized to determine the issue of ownership of properties 
for purposes of their inclusion or exclusion from the inventory to be submitted by the administrator
, but its determination 
shall only be provisional

 unless the interested parties are all heirs of the decedent, or the 
question is one of collation or advancement, or the parties consent to 
the assumption of jurisdiction by the probate court and the rights of 
third parties are not impaired. Its jurisdiction extends to matters 
incidental or collateral to the settlement and distribution of the 
estate, such as the determination of the status of each heir and whether
 property included in the inventory is the conjugal or exclusive 
property of the deceased spouse. 


 x x x x


 
The general rule is that the jurisdiction of the trial court,
 either as a probate court or an intestate court, relates only to 
matters having to do with the probate of the will and/or settlement of 
the estate of deceased persons, but does not extend to the determination
 of questions of ownership that arise during the proceedings. 
The 
patent rationale for this rule is that such court merely exercises 
special and limited jurisdiction. As held in several cases, a probate 
court or one in charge of estate proceedings, whether testate or 
intestate, 
cannot adjudicate or determine title to properties claimed to be a part of the estate

 and which are claimed to belong to outside parties, not by virtue of 
any right of inheritance from the deceased but by title adverse to that 
of the deceased and his estate. 
All that the said court could do as 
regards said properties is to determine whether or not they should be 
included in the inventory of properties to be administered by the 
administrator.
 If there is no dispute, there poses no problem, but 
if there is, then the parties, the administrator, and the opposing 
parties have to resort to an ordinary action before a court exercising 
general jurisdiction for a final determination of the conflicting claims
 of title. 




 To stress, the petition filed below is for 
probate
. The 
question is limited to determining the validity of a will for its 
allowance â not the distribution of the estate yet. Thus, we cannot 
concur in the trial court's reasoning that the issue on the approval of 
the Segregation Agreement was mooted by Thelma's eventual inheritance of
 Cecilia's entire estate. For the properties under Cecilia's ownership 
would still be subject to accounting, collation, and even payment of 
loans or setting off liabilities. 
 So must it be. 
 
ACCORDINGLY
, the petition is 
GRANTED
. The Decision
[61]
 dated December 7, 2018 and Resolution
[62]
 dated May 8, 2019 are 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
. The Decision
[63]
 dated June 30, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court Branch 32, San Pablo City, Laguna is 
REINSTATED with MODIFICATION
. 
 The last will and testament of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico, contained in her 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya
 executed on September 10, 1996 is 
ADMITTED
 to probate. 
  
 Let letters testamentary and/or administration be 
ISSUED
 in favor of Thelma Esguerra Guia without posting any bond. In accordance with the 
Huling Habilin at Pagpapasiya

 of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico, Thelma Esguerra Guia shall be the executor 
of, and the sole heir, to the estate of Cecilia Esguerra Cosico. 
  
 Within three (3) months after her appointment as executor or administrator, Thelma Esguerra Guia is 
DIRECTED
 to 
SUBMIT

 a true inventory and appraisal of all the real and personal estate of 
Cecilia Esguerra Cosico. She may secure the services of a tax appraiser 
for this purpose. 
 Thelma Esguerra Guia is also 
DIRECTED
