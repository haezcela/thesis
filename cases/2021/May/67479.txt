DECISION




CAGUIOA, J:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the August 28, 2019 Decision
[2]
 (
Assailed Decision
) and the November 20, 2019 Resolution
[3]
 (
Assailed Resolution
) of the Court of Appeals (CA), First Division, in CA-G.R. CV No. 111884. The CA affirmed the April 30, 2018 Decision
[4]
 and July 20, 2018 Order
[5]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 225, Quezon City, in Spec. Proc. No. RÂ­ QZN-17-04454,
[6]
 which denied petitioner's Rule 103 petition for change of name from "Francis Luigi G. Santos" to "Francis Luigi G. Revilla."


The Facts and Antecedent Proceedings



Petitioner Francis Luigi G. Santos (petitioner) filed a petition for 
change of name under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court seeking to change 
his surname from "Santos" to "Revilla" in his Certificate of Live Birth.
[7]

 He alleged that sometime in 1991, his parents, Lovely Maria T. Guzman 
(Lovely Guzman) and Jose Marie Bautista, Jr. also known as Ramon Bong 
Revilla, Jr. (Bong Revilla), met and engaged in an intimate 
relationship.
[9]
 He was later born in Quezon City on January 9, 1992 as "Francis Luigi Guzman."
[10]





Lovely Guzman and Bong Revilla were never married as the latter was already married to Lani Mercado.
[11]
 Thus, petitioner's Certificate of Live Birth did not bear the Revilla surname and his father was marked as unknown.
[12]
 However, on April 24, 1996, Bong Revilla executed an Affidavit of Acknowledgment recognizing petitioner as his son.
[13]



In 1999, Lovely Guzman married Patrick Joseph P. Santos (Patrick 
Santos), who, in turn, legally adopted petitioner. Thus, petitioner's 
name was changed from "Francis Luigi Guzman" to "Francis Luigi G. 
Santos."
[14]





Although petitioner lived with his mother, he grew up close to Bong 
Revilla and the latter's wife and children and was treated by the family
 as a legitimate son.
[15]
 He also claimed that he used the name "Luigi Revilla" when he entered show business.
[16]

 Thus, he filed the instant petition in order to "avoid confusion," "to 
show [his] sincere and genuine desire to associate himself to [Bong 
Revilla] and to the Revillas,"
[17]
 and to ensure that his records show his true identity as Bong Revilla's son.
[18]



On June 19, 2017, the RTC issued an Order finding the petition to be 
sufficient in form and substance and directed that the Order be (1) 
published in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive 
weeks, (2) sent to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the Office
 of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City, the Local Civil Registrar of 
Quezon City, and the Philippine Statistics Office,
[19]
 and (3) posted in three public places where petitioner resides.
[20]



The Republic of the Philippines, through the OSG, filed its opposition 
and sought the dismissal of the petition claiming that there was no 
compelling reason to justify the change sought.
[21]


The Ruling of the RTC



In its April 30, 2018 Decision,
[22]

 the RTC denied the petition and held that a change of name was not a 
matter of right and could be granted only for compelling reasons.
[23]

 In the instant case, the RTC held that petitioner failed to show that 
there was any valid or justifiable ground for change of name. In fact, 
the RTC held that allowing petitioner to use the surname "Revilla" 
rather than "Santos" would create further confusion, given that he had 
already been legally adopted by Patrick Santos in 2001.
[24]

 As an adopted child, the RTC held that petitioner was bound to use the 
surname "Santos" as adoption legally severs the legal tie between the 
adoptee and his or her biological parents.
[25]



The RTC further noted that there was no reason to grant the change 
sought, given that petitioner has never legally used the name "Revilla" 
despite having been acknowledged in 1996, he has used the name "Santos" 
for all documentary purposes since his adoption,
[26]

 and he only began using the surname "Revilla" when he entered show 
business. There could thus be no confusion as to his real identity as 
the name "Luigi Revilla" was a mere screen name, which may be different 
from his legal name.
[27]


The Ruling of the CA



In the 
Assailed Decision
, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC
 and held that allowing a change of name would create more confusion as 
to petitioner's status and filiation given that he had already been 
legally adopted by Patrick Santos. It was of no moment therefore that he
 is the biological son of Bong Revilla as the Family Code and Republic 
Act No. (R.A.) 8552
[28]
 or the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998 provide that an adopted child shall bear the surname of the adopting parents.
[29]



The CA further stated that the corrections sought involved substantial 
amendments to petitioner's birth certificate, as allowing a change in 
surname from "Santos" to "Revilla" would constitute a change in his 
status from "legitimate" to "illegitimate." As such, the CA held that 
petitioner should have availed himself of the adversarial proceeding 
under Rule 108 for cancellation and/or correction of entries rather than
 the summary proceeding under Rule 103 for change of name.
[30]

 Further, as petitioner failed to implead both his biological father and
 his adoptive father, the CA held that the proceedings were void under 
Section 3, Rule 108 for failure to implead indispensable parties.
[31]



Petitioner thus filed the instant Petition claiming, among others, that 
(1) the CA erred in ruling that Rule 108 of the Rules of Court applies 
and that the proceedings were void for failure to implead indispensable 
parties,
[32]
 and (2) that a 
change of name from "Santos" to "Revilla" may be allowed under the law 
by way of exception to the mandatory provisions on the use of surnames.
[33]



In its Comment,
[34]
 the OSG 
alleged that the CA did not err (1) in denying the appeal for 
petitioner's failure to comply with the requirements under Rule 108 of 
the Rules of Court
[35]
 and (2) in ruling that petitioner has not shown any proper or reasonable cause which may justify the change of his surname.
[36]




Issues




Whether the CA erred (1) in holding that Rule 108 rather than Rule 103 
applies and (2) in denying the petition to change petitioner's surname 
from "Santos" to "Revilla".


The Court's Ruling



The Petition has partial merit. Contrary to the position of the CA, 
petitioner correctly availed of a Rule 103 proceeding to effect the 
desired change. However, the Court agrees with the CA, as well as the 
RTC, that petitioner failed to prove that there was any compelling 
reason to justify the change sought.






Petitioner correctly availed of a Rule 103 petition for change of name


 






Republic v. Hernandez
[37]
 (
Hernandez
) discussed the nature of Rule 103 petitions for change of name in this wise:


The official name of a person whose birth is registered in 
the civil register is the name appearing therein. If a change in one's 
name is desired, this can only be done by filing and strictly complying 
with the substantive and procedural requirements for a special 
proceeding for change of name under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court, 
wherein the sufficiency of the reasons or grounds therefor can be 
threshed out and accordingly determined.





 



Under Rule 103, a petition for change of name shall be filed in the 
regional trial court of the province where the person desiring to change
 his name resides. It shall be signed and verified by the person 
desiring the name to be changed or by some other person in his behalf 
and shall state that the petitioner has been a 
bona fide
 resident
 of the province where the petition is filed for at least three years 
prior to such filing, the cause for which the change of name is sought, 
and the name asked for. An order for the date and place of hearing shall
 be made and published, with the Solicitor General or the proper 
provincial or city prosecutor appearing for the Government at such 
hearing. It is only upon satisfactory proof of the veracity of the 
allegations in the petition and the reasonableness of the causes for the
 change of name that the court may adjudge that the name be changed as 
prayed for in the petition, and shall furnish a copy of said judgment to
 the civil registrar of the municipality concerned who shall forthwith 
enter the same in the civil register.


x x x x


It is necessary to reiterate in this discussion that a person's name is a
 word or combination of words by which he is known and identified, and 
distinguished from others, for the convenience of the world at large in 
addressing him, or in speaking of or dealing with him. It is both of 
personal as well as public interest that every person must have a name. 
The name of an individual has two parts: the given or proper name and 
the surname or family name. The given or proper name is that which is 
given to the individual at birth or at baptism, to distinguish him from 
other individuals. 
The surname or family name is that which 
identifies the family to which he belongs and is continued from parent 
to child. The given name may be freely selected by the parents for the 
child, but the surname to which the child is entitled is fixed by law.




By Article 408 of the Civil Code, a person's birth must be entered in 
the civil register. The official name of a person is that given him in 
the civil register. That is his name in the eyes of the law. 
And once
 the name of a person is officially entered in the civil register, 
Article 376 of the same Code seals that identity with its precise 
mandate: no person can change his name or surname without judicial 
authority. This statutory restriction is premised on the interest of the
 State in names borne by individuals and entities for purpose of 
identification.




By reason thereof, the only way that the name of person can be 
changed legally is through a petition for change of name under Rule 103 
of the Rules of Court. For purposes of an application for change of name
 under Article 376 of the Civil Code and correlatively implemented by 
Rule 103, the only name that may be changed is the true or official name
 recorded in the civil register.
 As earlier mentioned, a petition for change of name being a proceeding 
in rem
,
 impressed as it is with public interest, strict compliance with all the
 requisites therefor in order to vest the court with jurisdiction is 
essential, and failure therein renders the proceedings a nullity.


It must likewise be stressed once again that a change of name is a 
privilege not a matter of right, addressed to the sound discretion of 
the court which has the duty to consider carefully the consequences of a
 change of name and to deny the same unless weighty reasons are shown. 
Before a person can be authorized to change his name, that is, his true 
or official name or that which appears in his birth certificate or is 
entered in the civil register, he must show proper and reasonable cause 
or any convincing reason which may justify such change.


Jurisprudence has recognized, 
inter alia
, the following 
grounds as being sufficient to warrant a change of name: (a) when the 
name is ridiculous, dishonorable or extremely difficult to write or 
pronounce; (b) when the change results as a legal consequence of 
legitimation or adoption; (c) when the change will avoid confusion; (d) 
when one has continuously used and been known since childhood by a 
Filipino name and was unaware of alien parentage; (e) when the change is
 based on a sincere desire to adopt a Filipino name to erase signs of 
former alienage, all in good faith and without prejudice to anybody; and
 (f) when the surname causes embarrassment and there is no showing that 
the desired change of name was for a fraudulent purpose or that the 
change of name would prejudice public interest.
[38]
 (Underscoring supplied)





Rule 103 petitions for change of name based on the foregoing 
jurisprudential grounds is a separate and distinct remedy from that 
provided under Rule 108, which involves cancellations and corrections of
 entries in the civil registry.
[39]
 The Court explained the difference between Rule 103 and Rule 108 in 
Republic v. Mercadera
,
[40]
 as follows:


Rule 103 procedurally governs judicial petitions for 
change of given name or surname, or both, pursuant to Article 376 of the
 Civil Code.
 This rule provides the procedure for an independent 
special proceeding in court to establish the status of a person 
involving his relations with others, that is, his legal position in, or 
with regard to, the rest of the community. 
In petitions for change of
 name, a person avails of a remedy to alter the "designation by which he
 is known and called in the community in which he lives and is best 
known."
 When granted, a person's identity and interactions are 
affected as he bears a new "label or appellation for the convenience of 
the world at large in addressing him, or in speaking of, or dealing with
 him." Judicial permission for a change of name aims to prevent fraud 
and to ensure a record of the change by virtue of a court decree.


The proceeding under Rule 103 is also an action 
in rem
 which 
requires publication of the order issued by the court to afford the 
State and all other interested parties to oppose the petition. When 
complied with, the decision binds not only the parties impleaded but the
 whole world. As notice to all, publication serves to indefinitely bar 
all who might make an objection. "It is the publication of such notice 
that brings in the whole world as a party in the case and vests the 
court with jurisdiction to hear and decide it."


Essentially, a change of name does not define or effect a change of 
one's existing family relations or in the rights and duties flowing 
therefrom. It does not alter one's legal capacity or civil status. 
However, "there could be instances where the change applied for may be 
open to objection by parties who already bear the surname desired by the
 applicant, not because he would thereby acquire certain family ties 
with them but because the existence of such ties might be erroneously 
impressed on the public mind." Hence, in requests for a change of name, 
"what is involved is not a mere matter of allowance or disallowance of 
the request, but a judicious evaluation of the sufficiency and propriety
 of the justifications advanced x x x mindful of the consequent results 
in the event of its grant x x x."


Rule 108, on the other hand, implements judicial proceedings for the 
correction or cancellation of entries in the civil registry pursuant to 
Article 412 of the Civil Code. Entries in the civil register refer to 
"acts, events and judicial decrees concerning the civil status of 
persons," also as enumerated in Article 408 of the same law.
 Before,
 only mistakes or errors of a harmless and innocuous nature in the 
entries in the civil registry may be corrected under Rule 108 and 
substantial errors affecting the civil status, citizenship or 
nationality of a party are beyond the ambit of the rule. x x x


x x x x


Finally in 
Republic v. Valencia
, the above stated views were adopted by this Court insofar 
as
 even substantial errors or matters in a civil registry may be corrected
 and the true facts established, provided the parties aggrieved avail 
themselves of the appropriate adversary proceeding
. "If the purpose 
of the petition is merely to correct the clerical errors which are 
visible to the eye or obvious to the understanding, the court may, under
 a summary procedure, issue an order for the correction of a mistake. 
However, as repeatedly construed, 
changes which may affect the civil status from legitimate to illegitimate, as well as sex, are substantial and controversial

 alterations which can only be allowed after appropriate adversary 
proceedings depending upon the nature of the issues involved. 
Changes which affect the civil status or citizenship of a party are substantial in character

 and should be threshed out in a proper action depending upon the nature
 of the issues in controversy, and wherein all the parties who may be 
affected by the entries are notified or represented and evidence is 
submitted to prove the allegations of the complaint, and proof to the 
contrary admitted x x x." "Where such a change is ordered, the Court 
will not be establishing a substantive right but only correcting or 
rectifying an erroneous entry in the civil registry as authorized by 
law. 
In short, Rule 108 of the Rules of Court provides only the 
procedure or mechanism for the proper enforcement of the substantive law
 embodied in Article 412 of the Civil Code and so does not violate the 
Constitution.


x x x x


It appears from these arguments that there is, to some extent, confusion
 over the scope and application of [Rule] 103 and Rule 108. Where a 
"change of name" will necessarily be reflected by the corresponding 
correction in an entry, as in this case, the functions of both rules are
 often muddled. While there is no clear-cut rule to categorize petitions
 under either rule, this Court is of the opinion that a resort to the 
basic distinctions between the two rules with respect to alterations in a
 person's registered name can effectively clear the seeming perplexity 
of the issue. Further, a careful evaluation of circumstances alleged in 
the petition itself will serve as a constructive guide to determine the 
propriety of the relief prayed for.


The "change of name" contemplated under Article 376 and Rule 103 must
 not be confused with Article 412 and Rule 108. A change of one's name 
under Rule 103 can be granted only on grounds provided by law. In order 
to justify a request for change of name, there must be a proper and 
compelling reason for the change and proof that the person requesting 
will be prejudiced by the use of his official name. To assess the 
sufficiency of the grounds invoked therefor, there must be adversarial 
proceedings.


In petitions for correction, only clerical, spelling, typographical 
and other innocuous errors in the civil registry may be raised. 
Considering that the enumeration in Section 2, Rule 108 also includes 
"changes of name," the correction of a patently misspelled name is 
covered by Rule 108. Suffice it to say, not all alterations allowed in 
one's name are confined under Rule 103. Corrections for clerical errors 
may be set right under Rule 108.


This rule in "names," however, does not operate to entirely limit Rule 
108 to the correction of clerical errors in civil registry entries by 
way of a summary proceeding. As explained above, 
Republic v. Valencia

 is the authority for allowing substantial errors in other entries like 
citizenship, civil status, and paternity, to be corrected using Rule 108
 provided there is an adversary proceeding. "After all, the role of the 
Court under Rule 108 is to ascertain the truths about the facts recorded
 therein."
[41]
 (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)



Notably, the foregoing rules were modified by the enactment of R.A. 9048,
[42]

 which amended Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code and vested primary
 jurisdiction over the correction of certain clerical or typographical 
errors and changes of first name with the civil registrar.
[43]
 In 2012, R.A. 10172
[44]

 expanded the coverage of the summary administrative procedure provided 
under R.A. 9048 to include clerical corrections in the day and/or month 
in the date of birth, or in the sex of the person, where it is patently 
clear that there was a clerical or typographical error or mistake in the
 entry.
[45]
 Presently 
therefore, when an entry falls within the coverage of R.A. 9048 as 
amended by R.A. 10172, a person may only avail of the appropriate 
judicial remedies under Rule 103 or Rule 108 
after
 the petition in the administrative proceedings is first filed and later denied.
[46]

 Failure to comply with the administrative procedure generally renders 
the petition dismissible for failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
and for failure to comply with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.
[47]



The Court, in 
Bartolome v. Republic
,
[48]
 summarized the rules as follows:


1. A person seeking 1) to 
change his or her first name
, 2) to 
correct clerical or typographical errors
 in the civil register, 3) to change/correct the 
day and/or month of his or her date of birth
, and/or 4) to change/correct his or her 
sex
,
 where it is patently clear that there was a clerical or typographical 
error or mistake, must first file a verified petition with the local 
civil registry office of the city or municipality where the record being
 sought to be corrected or changed is kept, in accordance with the 
administrative proceeding provided under R.A. 9048 in relation to R.A. 
10172. A person may only avail of the appropriate judicial remedies 
under Rule 103 or Rule 108 in the aforementioned entries 
after
 the petition in the administrative proceedings is filed and later denied.


2. A person seeking 1) 
to change his or her 
surname
 or 2) to change both his or her 
first name 
and
 surname
 may file a petition for change of name under Rule 103, provided that the jurisprudential grounds discussed in 
Republic v. Hernandez
 are present.


3. A person seeking 
substantial cancellations or corrections
 of entries in the civil registry may file a petition for cancellation or correction of entries under Rule 108. As discussed in 
Lee v. Court of Appeals
 and more recently, in 
Republic v. Cagandahan
,
 R.A. 9048 "removed from the ambit of Rule 108 of the Rules of Court the
 correction of such errors. Rule 108 now applies only to substantial 
changes and corrections in entries in the civil register."
[49]
 (Underscoring in the original; emphasis supplied)



Based on the foregoing, the Court holds that petitioner correctly 
availed himself of the remedy under Rule 103 in order to change his 
surname from "Santos" to "Revilla." Contrary to the findings of the CA, 
Rule 108 is inapplicable as petitioner does not allege or identify any 
erroneous entry that requires substantial rectification or cancellation.



It is a threshold principle that the nature of a proceeding is 
determined by the allegations in the petition and the ultimate reliefs 
sought. In the instant case, it is apparent that petitioner does not 
seek to correct any clerical or substantial error in his birth 
certificate or to effect any changes in his status as an adopted child 
of Patrick Santos.
[50]
 As 
such, neither Rule 108 nor R.A. 9048 as amended applies. Rather, the 
petition is unequivocal that petitioner merely desires to change and 
replace his surname "Santos" with the surname "Revilla" in accordance 
with Hernandez in order to "avoid confusion,"
[51]

 "to show [his] sincere and genuine desire to associate himself to 
[Bong] Revilla[,] Jr. and to the Revillas, and to show that he accepts 
and embraces his true identity."
[52]

 He alleges that while he grew up close to his biological father and his
 family and was purportedly publicly known as "Bong Revilla's son,"
[53]
 "there is nothing in his name that would associate him and identify him as one of the Revillas."
[54]

 These allegations show that petitioner ultimately seeks to "alter the 
'designation by which he is known and called in the community in which 
he lives and is best known'"
[55]

 and not to effect any clerical or substantial corrections. Thus, he 
properly availed himself of the procedure prescribed under Rule 103.



In this regard, the CA gravely erred in holding that petitioner should 
have availed himself of the adversarial proceeding under Rule l 08 
instead of the "summary proceeding" under Rule 103
[56]

 as allowing petitioner to change his surname from "Santos" to "Revilla"
 would constitute a change in his status from "legitimate" to 
"illegitimate."
[57]


First
. While a change in status may legally result in a change of
 name, such as in marriages, annulments, legitimations, or adoptions, 
et al.
, the reverse is not equally true. In 
Yu v. Republic
,
[58]
 the Court already held that a change of surname under Rule 103 does not necessarily result in a change of petitioner's status, 
i.e.
, from legitimate to illegitimate, 
viz
.:


x x x [A] change of name as authorized under Rule 103 does 
not by itself define, or effect a change in, one's existing family 
relations, or in the rights and duties flowing therefrom; nor does it 
create new family rights and duties where none before were existing. It 
does not alter one's legal capacity, civil status[,] or citizenship. 
What is altered is only the name, which is that word or combination of 
words by which a person is distinguished from others and which he bears 
as the label of appellation for the convenience of the world at large in
 addressing him, or in speaking of or dealing with him (38 Am. Jur. 
596). x x x




To be sure, there could be instances where the change applied for may be
 open to objection by parties who already bear the surname desired by 
the applicant, not because he would thereby acquire certain family ties 
with them but because the existence of such ties might be erroneously 
impressed on the public mind. But this is precisely the purpose of the 
judicial application to determine whether there is proper and reasonable
 cause for the change of name. As held by this Court in several cases, 
in which pertinently enough the petitioners were aliens, the change is 
not a matter of right but of judicial discretion, to be exercised in the
 light of the reasons adduced and the consequences that will likely 
follow x x x.
[59]





Indeed, petitioner cannot change his status as an adopted child of 
Patrick Santos to an "illegitimate" child of Bong Revilla by the mere 
expedient of changing his name as an adoption may only be rescinded in 
accordance with law.
[60]
 In any event, petitioner was unequivocal that he does not seek to change his status or to rescind his adoption:


x x x [H]e is an adoptee of Patrick Santos and an 
illegitimate son of Bong Revilla. He seeks to alter his last name from 
"Santos" to "Revilla", the designation by which he is known and called 
in the community in which he lives and is best known to avoid confusion.
 
Changing Luigi's last name from "Santos" to "Revilla" will not 
affect his civil status, as the decision in the matter of his adoption 
is included and registered in the official record file of OLC-QC. He 
does not seek to change his status from legitimate to illegitimate. 
Patrick Santos remains to be the named father in his birth certificate, 
being his adoptive father.
[61]
 (Underscoring in the original omitted; underscoring supplied)


Second
. Contrary to the statement of the CA, both Rule 108 and 
Rule 103 involve substantial matters and require adversarial 
proceedings. As explained, "[a] change of one's name under Rule 103 can 
be granted, only on grounds provided by law. In order to justify a 
request for change of name, there must be a proper and compelling reason
 for the change and proof that the person requesting will be prejudiced 
by the use of his official name. To assess the sufficiency of the 
grounds invoked therefor, 
there must be adversarial proceedings
."
[62]
 It is an action 
in rem

 which requires publication of the order issued by the court to afford 
the State, through the OSG, and all other interested parties to oppose 
the petition.
[63]



In relation thereto, the Court finds that the CA erred in holding that the instant proceedings were void under Section 3,
[64]

 Rule 108 as petitioner failed to implead both his adoptive father and 
his biological father as indispensable parties. Notably, while Rule 108 
expressly requires that the petitioner implead all persons who have or 
claim any interest which would be affected, no such requirement appears 
in Rule 103. The relevant sections provide:

Notably, unlike Rule 108, Rule 103 only requires that the order reciting
 the purpose of the petition and the date and place of the hearing be

In sum, the Court holds that petitioner correctly availed himself of a 
Rule 103 petition. Further, the failure to implead petitioner's 
biological father and adoptive father did not render the proceedings 
void as said requirement does not apply to Rule 103.



However, the Court agrees with the CA and the RTC that petitioner failed
 to prove that there is any compelling reason to justify a change of 
surname from "Santos" to "Revilla".






There is no compelling reason to grant the change of surname


 







It has long been settled that "the State has an interest in the names 
borne by individuals and entities for purposes of identification and 
that a change of name is a privilege and not a matter of right x x x."
[67]
 In 
In Re: Petition for Change of Name and/or Correction of Entry in the Civil Registry of Julian Lin Carulasan Wang
[68]
 (
Wang
), the Court held:


In granting or denying petitions for change of name, the 
question of proper and reasonable cause is left to the sound discretion 
of the court. The evidence presented need only be satisfactory to the 
court and not all the best evidence available. What is involved is not a
 mere matter of allowance or disallowance of the request, but a 
judicious evaluation of the sufficiency and propriety of the 
justifications advanced in support thereof, mindful of the consequent 
results in the event of its grant and with the sole prerogative for 
making such determination being lodged in the courts.


x x x x


A discussion on the legal significance of a person's name is relevant at this point. We quote, thus:


"x x x For all practical and legal purposes, a man's name is
 the designation by which he is known and called in the community in 
which he lives and is best known. It is defined as the word or 
combination of words by which a person is distinguished from other 
individuals and, also, as the label or appellation which he bears for 
the convenience of the world at large addressing him, or in speaking of 
or dealing with him. Names are used merely as one method of indicating 
the identity of persons; they are descriptive of persons for 
identification, since, the identity is the essential thing and it has 
frequently been held that, when identity is certain, a variance in, or 
misspelling of, the name is immaterial.


The names of individuals usually have two parts: the given name or 
proper name, and the surname or family name. The given or proper name is
 that which is given to the individual at birth or baptism, to 
distinguish him from other individuals. The name or family name is that 
which identifies the family to which he belongs and is continued from 
parent to child. The given name may be freely selected by the parents 
for the child; but the surname to which the child is entitled is fixed 
by law.


A name is said to have the following characteristics: (1) It is 
absolute, intended to protect the individual from being confused with 
others. (2) It is obligatory in certain respects, for nobody can be 
without a name. (3) 
It is fixed, unchangeable, or immutable, at least
 at the start, and may be changed only for good cause and by judicial 
proceedings.
 (4) It is outside the commerce of man, and, therefore, inalienable and intransmissible by act 
inter vivos
 or 
mortis causa
. (5) It is imprescriptible."
[69]
 (Underscoring supplied)





To emphasize, the surname identifies the family to which a person 
belongs. While the first name may be freely selected by the parents for 
the child, the surname to which the child is entitled is 
fixed by law
.
[70]



This rule, however, is not absolute. Precisely, Article 376 of the Civil
 Code as implemented by Rule 103 is a remedy allowed by way of exception
 to the mandatory provisions of the Civil Code on the use of surnames.
[71]

 To justify a change of name however, a person "must show not only some 
proper or compelling reason x x x but also that he will be prejudiced by
 the use of his true and official name."
[72]

 The following have been considered as valid grounds for change of name:
 "(a) when the name is ridiculous, dishonorable or extremely difficult 
to write or pronounce; (b) when the change results as a legal 
consequence, as in legitimation; (c) when the change will avoid 
confusion; (d) when one has continuously used and been known since 
childhood by a Filipino name, and was unaware of alien parentage; (e) a 
sincere desire to adopt a Filipino name to erase signs of former 
alienage, all in good faith and without prejudicing anybody; and (f) 
when the surname causes embarrassment and there is no showing that the 
desired change of name was for a fraudulent purpose or that the change 
of name would prejudice public interest."
[73]



Applying the foregoing principles to the instant case, there can be no 
question that petitioner, as the legally adopted child of Patrick 
Santos, properly bears the surname "Santos". Notably, the Civil Code 
provides:


TITLE XIII


Use of Surnames (n)





ARTICLE 364. Legitimate and legitimated children shall principally use the surname of the father.





 



ARTICLE 365. 
An adopted child shall bear the surname of the adopter.
 (Underscoring supplied)





Consistent therewith, Article 189 of the Family Code states that "the 
adopted shall be deemed to be a legitimate child of the adopters and 
both shall acquire the reciprocal rights and obligations arising from 
the relationship of parent and child, 
including the right of the adopted to use the surname of the adopter
."
[74]
 The Family Code provisions on Adoption were superseded by R.A. 8552,
[75]
 which now provides:




ARTICLE V


EFFECTS OF ADOPTION



SEC. 16. 
Parental Authority
. - 
Except in cases where the 
biological parent is the spouse .of the adopter, all legal ties between 
the biological parent(s) and the adoptee shall be severed and the same 
shall then be vested on the adopter(s).



SEC. 17. 
Legitimacy
. - The adoptee 
shall be considered the 
legitimate son/daughter of the adopter(s) for all intents and purposes 
and as such is entitled to all the rights and obligations provided by 
law to legitimate sons/daughters born to them without discrimination of 
any kind
. To this end, the adoptee is entitled to love, guidance, 
and support in keeping with the means of the family. (Underscoring 
supplied)



R.A. 8552 likewise states that upon adoption, "[a]n amended certificate 
of birth shall be issued by the Civil Registry, as required by the Rules
 of Court, attesting to the fact that the adoptee is the child of the 
adopter(s) by being registered with his/her surname."
[76]
 As held therefore in 
Republic v. Court of Appeals
,
[77]

 it may be inferred from the very wording of the law "that the use of 
the surname of the adopter by the adopted child is both an 
obligation and a right
."
[78]

 Upon issuance of the decree of adoption, the change of the adoptee's 
surname shall follow that of the adopter as a natural and necessary 
consequence of a grant of adoption, even if not specifically prayed for.
[79]





Although properly surnamed "Santos", petitioner prays that he be allowed
 to change his surname from "Santos" to "Revilla" to "avoid confusion, x
 x x to show [his] sincere and genuine desire to associate himself to 
[Bong] Revilla[,] Jr. and to the Revillas, x x x to show that he accepts
 and embraces his true identity,"
[80]
 and "to show his true and genuine love to his biological father."
[81]
 Unfortunately, none of these reasons justify, in law, the desired change.


First
. The Court agrees with the RTC that the use of the surname 
"Revilla" would create further confusion rather than avoid it, given 
that: (1) petitioner has never legally used the name "Revilla" despite 
having been acknowledged in 1996; (2) he was legally adopted by Patrick 
Santos in 2001; (3) he has used the name "Santos" for all documentary 
purposes since his adoption; (4) although he is publicly known to be the
 son of Bong Revilla, he is known by his peers as "Luigi Santos"; (5) 
even after a change of surname, Patrick Santos shall continue to be the 
father named in his birth certificate; and (5) he only began using the 
surname "Revilla" when he entered show business.
[82]
 The following factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Court:


"In the case at bar, the only reason advanced for the 
dropping of his surname Santos to Revilla is to show his lineage and 
identity as Revilla. However, the compelling reason how such change of 
name is necessary to show his lineage as a Revilla is not clearly 
established. As petitioner himself and his witnesses testified, he has 
been a (sic) known as the son of Bong Revilla all his life and yet never
 used the surname despite being acknowledged by his biological father in
 1996. As testified on by his mother, it was never a secret that he was 
(sic) the son of Bong Revilla, everybody knew he was (sic) a Revilla. 
All of his mother's family, friends, co-parent in school know him as 
Luigi Santos, son of Bong Revilla. He has been using Santos since his 
adoption until college, then he started doing teleserye in GMA that was 
when he started using Revilla. The other witness, Bryan Revilla, even 
testified that petitioner has always been using Santos for documentary 
purposes up to the present and it was only when he entered show business
 that petitioner started using Revilla. He also testified that 
petitioner is loved by both his parents, Bong Revilla and Lani Mercado 
and that they always treat petitioner as their brother. Hence, it is 
clear that the perceived confusion came about when petitioner entered 
show business and started using the surname Revilla as his screen name. 
From then on, he would introduce himself as Luigi Revilla. And as 
testified on by petitioner, not being able to use the surname Revilla 
makes him incomplete, he however admitted that even if he use[s] the 
surname Santos, there would be no confusion.




x x x x


"There is no question that petitioner may file the instant petition, but
 change of name is a privilege and not a right. And as such, he must 
show proper or reasonable cause, or any compelling reason which may 
justify such change. In the case at hand, although petitioner did not 
deny his legitimacy, he failed to show proper and reasonable cause to 
justify the change sought or any compelling reason which may justify the
 change. A petitioner's convenience can never be a ground for a change 
of name x x x. Convenience cannot be considered as one of, or a 
recognized ground for change of name."
[83]









Indeed, these factual circumstances starkly differ from meritorious 
petitions for change of name where it was alleged and proved that 
petitioners publicly used their requested names in legal documents 
and/or school records since childhood and that a change would indeed 
avoid confusion, among other reasons.
[84]




Second
. While petitioner may factually identify and associate 
with his biological father and his family, he remains to be the 
legitimate son of Patrick Santos by virtue of the adoption. The latter 
and not the former is thus his true 
legal
 identity. It bears reiterating that adoption:


x x x (1) 
sever[s] all legal ties between the biological parent(s) and the adoptee
, except when the biological parent is the spouse of the adopter; (2) 
deem[s] the adoptee as a legitimate child of the adopter
;
 and (3) give[s] adopter and adoptee reciprocal rights and obligations 
arising from the relationship of parent and child, including but not 
limited to: (i) the right of the adopter to choose the name the child is
 to be known; and (ii) the right of the adopter and adoptee to be legal 
and compulsory heirs of each other. Therefore, even if emancipation 
terminates parental authority, the adoptee is still considered a 
legitimate child of the adopter with all the rights of a legitimate 
child such as: (1) 
to bear the surname of the father
 and the 
mother; (2) to receive support from their parents; and (3) to be 
entitled to the legitime and other successional rights. Conversely, the 
adoptive parents shall, with respect to the adopted child, enjoy all the
 benefits to which biological parents are entitled such as support and 
successional rights.
[85]
 (Underscoring supplied)



As adoption severs all legal ties between the adoptee and his or her 
biological parents, there is no basis to allow petitioner to change his 
name to "Revilla" simply because he is, biologically, the son of Bong 
Revilla and wants to associate himself with the Revilla family.


Finally
, it bears emphasis that a change of name is a privilege 
and not a matter of right. It is addressed to the sound discretion of 
the court. In 
Wang
, the Court denied a petition to drop a minor's
 middle name, even though the middle name would purportedly cause the 
minor undue embarrassment and become an obstacle to his social 
acceptance and integration in the Singaporean community.
[86]

 The Court noted that the only reason advanced by petitioner therein for
 the dropping of his middle name was convenience and found this 
justification to be amorphous and unmeritorious.
[87]
 Similarly, in 
Yu Chi Han v. Republic
[88]
 (
Yu Chi Han
),
 petitioner sought to change his name from "Yu Chi Han" to "Alejandro Go
 Yu," because he wanted to avoid confusion and to embrace the Catholic 
faith after he was baptized in accordance with Catholic rites. The Court
 denied the petition and held that the confusion was mainly due to 
petitioner's unauthorized use of a name other than his true name, which 
could be easily remedied by simply asking his friends and business 
associates to call him by his true name.
[89]




In the instant case, the Court finds that the reasons proffered do not 
fall under any of the jurisprudential grounds for change of name. They 
cannot even be considered as "akin to" any of the aforementioned 
grounds. The mere fact that petitioner began using a different name, 
i.e.
,
 "Luigi Revilla", when he joined show business does not constitute a 
proper and reasonable cause to legally authorize a change of name.
[90]
 As in 
Yu Chi Han
,
 any confusion created by the use of said name is mainly due to the 
unauthorized use of a name other than petitioner's true legal name. As 
in 
Wang
, convenience is not a recognized ground for change of 
name, which may be allowed only for compelling reasons that must be 
alleged and proved.
[91]


The Court is aware that it has previously allowed an adopted child named
 "Maximo Wong" to revert to "Maximo Alcala, Jr.," his name prior to his 
adoption, even though the adoption was never rescinded. In 
Republic v. Court of Appeals and Maximo Wong
[92]
 (
Wong
), the Court held:


While it is true that the statutory fiat under Article 365 
of the Civil Code is to the effect that an adopted child shall bear the 
surname of the adopter, it must nevertheless be borne in mind that the 
change of the surname of the adopted child is more an incident rather than the object of adoption proceedings
. The act of adoption fixes a status, 
viz.
,
 that of parent and child. More technically, it is an act by which 
relations of paternity and affiliation are recognized as legally 
existing between persons not so related by nature. It has been defined 
as the taking into one's family of the child of another as son or 
daughter and heir and conferring on it a title to the rights and 
privileges of such. The purpose of an adoption proceeding is to effect 
this new status of relationship between the child and its adoptive 
parents, the change of name which frequently accompanies adoption being 
more an incident than the object of the proceeding. The welfare of the 
child is the primary consideration in the determination of an 
application for adoption. On this part, there is unanimous agreement.




It is the usual effect of a decree of adoption to transfer from the 
natural parents to the adoptive parents the custody of the child's 
person, the duty of obedience owing by the child, and all other legal 
consequences and incidents of the natural relation, in the same manner 
as if the child had been born of such adoptive parents in lawful 
wedlock, subject, however, to such limitations and restrictions as may 
be by statute imposed. More specifically under the present state of our 
law, the Family Code, superseding the pertinent provisions of the Civil 
Code and of the Child and Youth Welfare Code on the matter, relevantly 
provides in this wise with regard to the issue involved in this case:




"Art. 189. Adoption shall have the following effects:



 



(1) For civil purposes, the adopted shall be deemed to be the legitimate
 child of the adopters and both shall acquire the reciprocal rights and 
obligations arising from the relationship of parent and child, including
 
the right of the adopted to use the surname of the adopters
;" (Emphasis supplied.)


x x x x


The Solicitor General maintains the position that to sustain the change 
of name would run counter to the behest of Article 365 of the Civil Code
 and the ruling in 
Manuel vs. Republic
 that "one should not be 
allowed to use a surname which otherwise he is not permitted to employ 
under the law," and would set a bad example to other persons who might 
also seek a change of their surnames on lame excuses.


While we appreciate the Solicitor General's apprehensions and concern, 
we find the same to be unfounded. We do not believe that by reverting to
 his old name, private respondent would then be using a name which he is
 prohibited by law from using. True, the law prescribes the surname that
 a person may employ; but the law does not go so far as to unqualifiedly
 prohibit the use of any other surname, and only subjects such recourse 
to the obtention of the requisite judicial sanction. What the law does 
not prohibit, it permits.




If we were to follow the argument of the Solicitor General to its 
conclusion, then there will never be any possibility or occasion for any
 person, regardless of status, to change his name, in view of the 
supposed subsequent violation of the legal imperative on the use of 
surnames in the event that the petition is granted. Rule 103 of the 
Rules of Court would then be rendered inutile. This could hardly have 
been the intendment of the law.


A petition for change of name is a remedy allowed under our law only 
by way of exception to the mandatory provisions of the Civil Code on the
 use of surnames. The law fixes the surnames that may be used by a 
person, at least inceptively, and it may be changed only upon judicial 
permission granted in the exercise of sound discretion. Section 1 of 
Rule 103, in specifying the parties who may avail of said remedy, uses 
the generic term "persons" to signify all natural persons regardless of 
status. If a legitimate person may, under certain judicially accepted 
exceptional circumstances, petition the court for a change of name, we 
do not see any legal basis or logic in discriminating against the 
availment of such a remedy by an adopted child. In other words, Article 
365 is not an exception, much less can it bar resort, to Rule 103.
[93]
 (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)



While the Court agrees that any person, whether legitimate, 
illegitimate, or adopted, may petition the court for change of name for 
compelling reasons,
[94]
 the factual circumstances in 
Wong
 wholly differ from the case at bar.









In 
Wong
, petitioner 
alleged
 and 
proved
 that he was 
severely prejudiced by the use of the surname "Wong," which embarrassed 
and isolated him from friends and relatives in view of a suggested 
Chinese ancestry when in reality he is a Muslim Filipino residing in a 
Muslim community. He alleged and proved that the continued use of said 
surname hampered his business and social life,
[95]
 
viz
.:


"The purpose of the law in allowing a change of name as 
contemplated by the provisions of Rule 103 of the Rules of Court is to 
give a person an opportunity to improve his personality and to provide 
his best interest. (Calderon vs. Republic, 19 SCRA 721). In granting or 
denying the petition for change of name, the question of proper and 
reasonable cause is left to the discretion of the court. The evidence 
presented need only be satisfactory to the court and not all the best 
evidence available is required. (Uy vs. Republic, L-22712, Nov. 25, 
1965; Nacionales vs. Republic, L-18067, April 29, 1966; both cases cited
 in 1 SCRA 843). In the present case, We believe that the court 
a quo
 had exercised its discretion judiciously when it granted the petition.



"From the testimony of petitioner-appellee and of his adopter mother 
Concepcion Ty-Wong, We discern that said appellee was prompted to file 
the petition for change of name because of the 
embarrassment and 
ridicule his family name 'Wong' brings in his dealings with his 
relatives and friends, he being a Muslim Filipino and living in a Muslim
 community
. Another cause is 
his desire to improve his social and business life
. It has been held that in the absence of prejudice to the state or any individual, 
a
 sincere desire to adopt a Filipino name to erase signs of a former 
alien nationality which only hamper(s) social and business life, is a 
proper and reasonable cause for change of name
 (Uy vs. Republic, 
L-22712, Nov. 25, 1965, Que Liong Sian vs. Republic, L-23167, Aug. 17, 
1967, 20 SCRA 1074). Justice dictates that a person should be allowed to
 improve his social standing as long as in doing so, he does not cause 
prejudice or injury to the interest of the State or of other persons 
(Calderon vs. Republic, 
supra
). Nothing whatsoever is shown in 
the record of this case that such prejudice or injury to the interest of
 the state or of other persons would result in the change of 
petitioner's name.
[96]
 (Underscoring supplied)



No similar compelling reason was alleged nor proved in this case. A 
sincere desire to associate oneself to a certain person or family, 
without more, does not justify a change of surname. In view of the 
foregoing, the Petition must be denied.

 R.A. 8552, Article VI provides:


SEC. 19. 
Grounds for Rescission of Adoption
. - Upon 
petition of the adoptee, with the assistance of the Department if a 
minor or if over eighteen (18) years of age but is incapacitated, as 
guardian/counsel, the adoption may be rescinded on any of the following 
grounds committed by the adopter(s): (a) repeated physical and verbal 
maltreatment by the adopter(s) despite having undergone counseling; (b) 
attempt on the life of the adoptee; (c) sexual assault or violence; or 
(d) abandonment and failure to comply with parental obligations.


Adoption, being in the best interest of the child, shall not be subject 
to rescission by the adopter(s). However, the adopter(s) may disinherit 
the adoptee for causes provided in Article 919 of the 
Civil Code
.


SEC. 20. 
Effects of Rescission
. - If the petition is granted, the
 parental authority of the adoptee's biological parent(s), if known, or 
the legal custody of the Department shall be restored if the adoptee is 
still a minor or incapacitated. The reciprocal rights and obligations of
 the adopter(s) and the adoptee to each other shall be extinguished.


The court shall order the Civil Registrar to cancel the amended 
certificate of birth of the adoptee and restore his/her original birth 
certificate.


Succession rights shall revert to its status prior to adoption, but only
 as of the date of judgment of judicial rescission. Vested rights 
acquired prior to judicial rescission shall be respected.


All the foregoing effects of rescission of adoption shall be without 
prejudice to the penalties imposable under the Penal Code if the 
criminal acts are properly proven.

 See 
Calderon v. Republic
, id. at 725, where the Court held:


x x x "While it is true that the Code provides that a 
natural child by legal fiction as the petitioner herein shall 
principally enjoy the surname of the father, yet, this does not mean 
that such child is prohibited by law from taking another surname with 
the latter's consent and for justifiable reasons." If under the law a 
legitimate child may secure a change of his name through judicial 
proceedings, upon a showing of a "proper and reasonable cause". We do 
not see any reason why a natural child cannot do the same. The purpose 
of the law in allowing a change of name, as contemplated by the 
provisions of Rule 103 of the Rules of Court is to give a person an 
opportunity to improve his personality and to promote his best 
interests. We are satisfied that the facts and circumstances as borne 
out by the record amply justify the change of the surname of the 
petitioner as ordered by the lower court. x x x
