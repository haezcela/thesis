Before the Court are Consolidated
[1]
 Petitions
[2]
 for Review on 
Certiorari
 (petitions) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Rules) filed by Ross Systems International, Inc., (RSII) and Global Medical Center of Laguna, Inc. (GMCLI), both assailing the Decision
[3]
 dated October 28, 2016 (assailed Decision) of the Court of Appeals, Sixth Division (CA), in CA-G.R. SP No. 145753. 
 The assailed Decision affirmed with modification the arbitral award
[4]
 dated May 10, 2016 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC), which mainly adjudged: (1) GMCLI was without authority to withhold and remit the 2% Creditable Withholding Tax (CWT) on the cumulative amount of 15 progress billings of RSII; (2) RSII was not entitled to the release of the amount of P4,884,778.92, equivalent to the 2% CWT withheld; and (3) RSII was still entitled to the amount of P1,088,214.33, representing the balance due after deducting from P8,131,474.83 the 2% CWT on Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 15 (in the amount of P3,941,769.00) and the payment already made to RSII (in the amount of P3,101,491.00).
[5]
 The CA likewise denied the motion for reconsideration of RSII through its Resolution
[6]
 dated February 21, 2017.
 
Factual Antecedents
 
 GMCLI engaged the services of RSII for the construction of its hospital in Cabuyao, Laguna, in accordance with a Construction Contract
[7]
 (Contract) which valued the entire construction project at P248,500,000.00,
[8]
 with 15% of said contract price to be paid to RSII as down payment, and the remaining balance to be paid in monthly installments based on the percentage of work accomplished.
[9]
 Under Section 9
[10]
 of the Contract, all taxes
[11]
 on the services rendered were for the account of RSII. Finally, an arbitration clause
[12]
 additionally stipulated the parties' resort to arbitration in the event of dispute.
 On April 12, 2015, RSII submitted to GMCLI its Progress Billing No. 15, which indicated that it had already accomplished 79.31% of the project, equivalent to P9,228,286.77, inclusive of VAT. After receipt and upon evaluation of GMCLI, however, it estimated that the accomplished percentage was only at 78.84% of the entire contract price or equivalent to P7,043,260.00 for Progress Billing No. 15,
[13]
 to wit: 
 
 Accomplishment Percent as of April 12, 2015:
 
As submitted by [RSII]: 79.31% x 248,500,000.00 = P197,088,497.00
 
 As submitted by [GMCLI]: 78.84% x 248,500,000.00 = P195,920,749.00
[14]
 
 
 
 GMCLI, after its internal audit, learned that it was unable to withhold and remit 2% CWT on RSII's Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 14.
[15]
 On April 29, 2015, in order to make up for its previous non-remittances, GMCLI withheld the 2% CWT not only from Progress Billing No. 15 (or from the amount of P7,043,260.00) but from the cumulative amount of all Progress Billings Nos. 1-15
[16]
 (or from the amount of P197,088,497.00, equivalent to the submitted 79.31% accomplishment of RSII).
[17]
 Thus, for RSII's Progress Billing No. 15 priced at P7,043,260.00., GMCLI only paid a total of P3,101,491.00, with computation as cited by the CIAC arbitral award
[18]
 as follows: 
 
  
 
 
 
Evaluated billing at 78.84% accomplishment
 
 
 
P7,043,260.00
 
 
 
Less: 2% of P197,088,497.01 (submitted billing of RSII, instead of P195,920,749.00, as submitted by GMCLI) 
 
 
 
(P3,941,769.00) 
 _____________
 
 
 
Payment 
 
 
 
P3,101,491.00
 
 
 
 
RSII sent two demand letters
[19]
 to GMCLI, claiming that it still had a balance of P4,884,778.92 to collect from the latter, under the following allegations: (1) GMCLI's outstanding obligation under Progress Billing No. 15 should have been P8,131,474.83, and not merely P7,043,260.00; and (2) GMCLI should not have belatedly withheld the 2% CWT on Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 14, but should only have withheld the 2% CWT from Progress Billing No. 15.
[20]
 
 
Proceedings before the CIAC
 With its demand unheeded, RSII filed a complaint and request for arbitration before the CIAC on August 6, 2015.
[21]
 GMCLI filed a motion to dismiss on August 27, 2015,
[22]
 assailing the jurisdiction of the CIAC. A Case Management Conference was held on October 20, 2015,
[23]
 followed by a Preliminary Conference on November 23, 2015,
[24]
 where a set of Terms of Reference (TOR) was signed.
[25]
 After the parties submitted their respective affidavits and pieces of documentary evidence,
[26]
 and presented their respective witnesses,
[27]
 both RSII and GMCLI submitted their Supplemental Draft Awards to the CIAC on April 26, 2016.
[28]
 On May 10, 2016, the CIAC promulgated its Final Award,
[29]
 which ruled that: 
 The CIAC has jurisdiction over the instant case as it involves a construction dispute. 
 [GMCLI] is not authorized to withhold and remit the CWT of 2% on the cumulative amount based on Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 15. 
 [RSII] is not entitled to the release of the amount of [P]4,884,778,92 as the balance for Progress Billing No. 15.
 [GMCLI] is not entitled to moral damages. 
 No attorney's fees shall be paid by either party to the other.
 The cost of arbitration shall be shouldered by the Parties in proportion to their respective claims.
[30]
 
 
 The CIAC held that the crux of the controversy was the correct computation of the amount due RSII under Progress Billing No. 15, and since the same claim stemmed from a construction contract, said controversy qualified as a construction dispute within the contemplation of Executive Order No. (E.O.) 1008,
[31]
 and within the ambit of the CIAC. 
 The CIAC further determined that with respect to the propriety of GMCLI's act of withholding and remitting the 2% CWT on the cumulative amount based on Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 15, GMCLI had no more authority to withhold and remit the same,
[32]
 reasoning thus: 
 
 Both [RSII] and GMCLI agree that, citing Revenue Regulation No. 2-98, as amended (RR 2-98), the 2% withholding tax must be withheld or deducted by the latter, as the withholding agent, from its payments for the former's services at the time said payments were made. x x x. 
 
 x x x x
 
 Applying the above provision to this case, [GMCLI]'s obligation to withhold the 2% withholding tax on the income derived by the [RSII] from the former's payments of Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 14 arose at the time it paid for each of said progress billings submitted to it by [RSII]. Not later, or worse, 
much
 later spanning at least three years, as what [GMCLI] did. 
 
 To justify its action of applying the 2% CWT deduction on the cumulative amount from Progress Billing[s] No[s]. 1 to [] 15, GMCLI recorded the amount in two installments as incomes of [RSII] for 2015. x x x This is falsehood and contrary to the above-cited provision of the Rules and Regulations of the BIR.
[33]
 
 
 However, the CIAC held that despite GMCLI's lack of authority to withhold the 2% CWT on the cumulative bill, RSII was still not entitled to the release of P4,884,778.92, or the amount equivalent to the 2% CWT withheld on the cumulative billings. Apart from observing that there was actually no dispute as to the computation
[34]
 as the same was not contested by GMCLI,
[35]
 the CIAC held that RSII was no longer entitled to the said amount because at the time the same was remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), RSII had not yet paid income taxes on the payments from Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 15.
[36]
 In addition, the CIAC held that the fact that RSII did declare the income taxes on those payments on March 22, 2016, or after GMCLI remitted the cumulated 2% CWT to BIR, was of no moment. Applying the doctrine of Last Clear Chance
[37]
 analogously, the CIAC held that RSII, having knowledge of GMCLI's prior remittance, had the last clear opportunity to avoid the loss through a double payment of the 2% CWT. It held that RSII's failure to avert the effective double payment could only be held on its own account.
[38]
 Finally, the CIAC held that GMCLI was not entitled to its claim of moral damages, as it could not be considered faultless, and that neither party could be awarded attorney's fees due to both parties' contributory lapses.
[39]
 
Proceedings before the CA
 Aggrieved, RSII filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules before the CA and assailed the CIAC arbitral award, imputing the following as errors: (1) the ruling that it was not entitled to the release of P4,884,778.92 as the balance of the payment for Progress Billing No. 15, and (2) the finding that it was not entitled to attorney's fees. 
 In its Decision
[40]
 dated October 28, 2016, the CA partially granted the petition, the dispositive portion of which reads: 
 
 
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
PARTIALLY GRANTED
. The Final Award dated [May 10, 2016] issued by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) in CIAC Case No. 20-2015 is 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
 in that [RSII] is still entitled to the payment of the amount of [P]1,088,214.83, which represents the balance after deducting from [P]8,131,474.83 (at 78.84% work accomplishment) the 2% CWT on Progress Billing[s] Nos. 1 to 15 in the amount of [P]3,941,769.00 and the payment already made to RSII in the amount of [P]3,101,491.00.
[41]
 
 
 In affirming the CIAC's award, the CA ruled that the amount of P3,815,996.50, equivalent to the 2% CWT on Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 14 was already remitted to the BIR,
[42]
 and it would be unjust to require GMCLI, as the withholding agent, to effectively shoulder the amount of tax which RSII had the legal duty to pay.
[43]
 With respect to granting RSII's entitlement to P1,088,214.83, the CA reasoned thus: 
 
 [RSII] is still, however, entitled to collect the amount of P1,088,214.83.
 
 To recall, [GMCLI] initially evaluated [RSII]'s accomplishment at 78.84% and computed the amount due to [RSII] at [P]7,043,260.00. Subtracted from this amount was the 2% CWT on the amount of [P]197,088,497.01, equivalent to [P]3,941,769,00, which [GMCLI] already remitted to the BIR. Thus, [GMCLI] paid [RSII] the amount of [P]3,101,491.00.
 
 [RSII] accepted [GMCLI]'s evaluation of its work accomplishment at 78.84% but argued that the amount due for Progress Billing No. 15 was [P]8,131,474.83, and not [P]7,043,260.00, and computed the amount it is still entitled to collect from [GMCLI] as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Submitted billing at 78.84% Accomplishment
 
 
 
P8,131,474,83. 
 
 
 
Less: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2% withholding tax for Progressive Billing No. 15 
 
 
 
P145,204.91
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P7,986,269.92
 
 
 
Less: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Payment made to [RSII] 
 
 
 
P3,101,491.00
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amount due / collectible 
 
 
 
P4,884,778.92
 
 
 
The CIAC ruled that there is no issue on the [RSII]'s computation since [GMCLI] did not contest the same. This said, [RSII] is still entitled to the amount of P1,088,214.83, which is computed as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Submitted billing at 78.84% Accomplishment
 
 
 
P8,131,474,830
 
 
 
Less: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Payment made to [RSII] 
 
 
 
P3,101,491.00
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2% withholding tax for Progressive Billing[s] Nos. 1 to 15 
 
 
 
P3,941,769.00
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amount due / collectible 
 
 
 
P1,088,214.83
[44]
 
 
 
 
 Both RSII's Motion for Partial Reconsideration and GMCLI's Motion for Reconsideration were denied through the CA's Resolution
[45]
 dated February 21, 2017. Hence the separate, now consolidated, petitions filed by GMCLI and RSII before the Court. 
 On the one hand, GMCLI prays that the assailed Decision be partially modified and the CIAC arbitral award be reinstated 
in toto
.
[46]
 On the other, RSII claims that it is entitled not only to the balance of P1,088,214.83, but to the amount of P3,815,996.50, equivalent to the allegedly improperly withheld 2% CWT, or that, in the alternative, GMCLI should be ordered to issue BIR Form 2307 (Certificate of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source) in favor of RSII.
[47]
 
Issues
 
 The parties come before the Court bearing the following consolidated issues: (1) whether RSII is entitled to the release of P3,815,996.50 or the equivalent of 2% CWT on Progress Billings Nos. 1 to 14, in addition to the award of P1,088,214.83 and (2) whether GMCLI may be ordered to issue BIR Form 2307 to RSII. 
 
The Court's Ruling
 
 The Court's resolution of the case before it is three-pronged and involves: (1) a revisit and untangling of the relevant laws and case pronouncements on the extent of judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards; 
 (2) a decisive harmonization of the standing laws on CIAC review 
vis-Ã -vis
 perceptible Constitutional limitations; and finally, (3) a determination of rights of the parties in accordance with existing tax laws on creditable withholding tax. 
 
I - Extent of Judicial Review vis-Ã -vis CIAC awards
 
 The case at bar presents the Court a timely opportunity to review and demarcate the laws and rules relevant to the relationship between the courts and the CIAC. Seen through the lens of the national policy of enabling alternatives to dispute resolution, the Court here takes a second look at judicial review and the specific mandate and authority of the CIAC, with the end of tracing how the extent of the former's reach over the latter, or the understanding thereof, has evolved over the years. 
 As will be seen in the succeeding discussions, the historical arc of this relationship appears to maintain the early, original legislative intent of judicial restraint in favor of the empowerment of arbitration. More particularly, a historical survey informs the Court of the intent of affording parties with a direct recourse to this Court in challenging a CIAC arbitral award on pure questions of law
[48]
 or one where only the application of the law as to uncontroverted facts is raised, which, under CIAC's original charter, and apart from the most excepting of circumstances, are the only questions that may be raised against it. 
 
Original and Affirmed Intent of E.O. 1008
 The construction industry, in and of itself wrought with factual complexity, is not a stranger to the industry-specific arbitration. In its international history, as early as the turn of the 20
th
 century, the peculiar intricacies of the construction processes and contracts have led to the call for industry-focused dispute resolution that implored professional decision-making and arbitration mechanisms.
[49]
 In the Philippines, the birth of construction arbitration can be traced back to the issuance of Presidential Decree No. (P.D.) 1746,
[50]
 which created the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP). Recognizing the need to provide a national environment conducive for its expansion, P.D. 1746 was issued to address the then non-cohesive government policies by providing a central agency tasked to accelerate as well as regulate the growth of the industry.
 On February 4, 1985, with the growth of the construction industry in full swing, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued E.O. 1008 which created the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) as the arbitration machinery for the Philippine construction industry. Its policy sought to ensure "early and expeditious settlement of disputes" in order to provide stability for its enterprises, and fairly insulate them from bureaucratic lags.
[51]
 Its whereas clause
[52]
 clearly provided for the law's resolve to remove the disputes of the industry from the languid and problematic machinery of the courts, with the full awareness that disputes held up in the judiciary's dockets easily translated to infrastructure projects that halted to a standstill. 
 The law likewise designed the CIAC awards to be decisive and conclusive, to wit: 
 
 SECTION 19. 
Finality of Awards
. - The arbitral award shall be binding upon the parties. It shall be final and [u]nappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court. 
 
 SECTION 20. 
Execution and Enforcement of Awards
. As soon as a decision, order or award has become final and executory, the Arbitral Tribunal or the single arbitrator, with the concurrence of the CIAC, shall [
motu proprio
] or on motion of any interested party, issue a writ of execution requiring any sheriff or other proper officer to execute said decision, order or award. 
 
 
 Section 19 of the CIAC Charter provides that findings of fact of the CIAC are no longer open to challenge on appeal, but its legal conclusions may be assailed before the Court. This narrow corridor of remedies against a CIAC award as categorically provided for in its Charter was broadened by two succeeding procedural rules which significantly altered the review mode of a CIAC award, with the final sum a scenario akin to procedural laws defeating specialized substantive law and its inceptive spirit. 
Procedural Departures: 
 Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 and
 Rule 43 of 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
 
 
The first procedural law which effectively expanded the reach of judicial review 
vis-Ã -vis
 CIAC arbitral awards is Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95,
[53]
 issued for the Court by then Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa on May 16, 1995, which amended Circular No. 1-91 and prescribed the rules governing appeals to the CA from final orders or decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies. For the first time, the CIAC was included in the enumeration of quasi-judicial agencies, the decisions of which may be appealed to the CA.
[54]
 This inclusion is the first clear departure from E.O. 1008's original provision that a CIAC arbitral award may only be appealed to this Court. Further, Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 also substantially extended judicial review powers in its categorical inclusion of questions of fact as those that may be appealed, to wit: 
 
 3. 
WHERE TO APPEAL
. â An appear under these rules may be taken to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided, whether the appeal involves 
questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law
. (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 This procedural expansion was affirmed by the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, particularly Rule 43 thereof,
[55]
 which once more included the CIAC as among the quasi-judicial agencies the decisions of which may be appealed to the CA with respect to either points of fact, or law, or both. 
 In retrospect, what may be gleaned is that the enabling of the CA to review questions of fact pertaining to the CIAC awards departed from E.O. 1008's original design of the relationship between the courts and the CIAC, when it created the latter. In effect, the authoritative expertise of the CIAC was undone with these two new procedural changes because with the CA's power to review the arbitral tribunal's factual determinations, the CA then acts as a trial court, before which factual assertions already threshed out in the CIAC are litigated anew. Needless to say, one may be reasonably hard-pressed to find sound basis for a court's exercise of reviewing a specialized tribunal's findings of fact that are well within its specialized competence and well-outside the court's. 
 More so, such a factual review easily runs the peril of being speculative, as it overly extends the review powers that may invite ridicule upon the courts, which are forced to venture into industry-specific technical findings that they are not designed to do. 
 To be sure, the Court dispels with utmost import any conclusion to the effect that upholding the CIAC's authoritative expertise on questions of facts before it necessarily translates to even the slightest implication of inadequacy of intelligence or inferiority of competence on the part of appellate judges. This inference is as unintended as it is unsupported by the succeeding exhaustive discussion of the history and the constitutional schema within which this particular mode of review is found. 
 The Court's iteration of the original limits set upon judicial review of the CIAC arbitral awards must not be considered impertinence against appellate judges, lest all rulings that delineate limits be seen as a put-down of the competence of the jurisdiction they confine. The Court here simply upholds the persuasive weight of factual findings of the CIAC, and consequently rules against a factual judicial review that effectively undermines the CIAC's conclusive and authoritative findings, consistent with the prevailing laws as outlined. 
 It further goes without saying that appellate judges are fully equipped to conduct factual review by evaluating whether or not factual findings of lower courts or tribunals are supported by evidence. This fact is affirmed not in the least by the fact that in the event that a factual review of the CIAC arbitral awards is merited in the narrowest of sense, the same may be brought before the CA through the appropriate petition. Demonstratively, therefore, the CA is ultimately not divested of any review powers that it was not intended to wield, to begin with, but merely donned with the authority of review of the CIAC arbitral awards that falls within the original extent of E.O. 1008. 
 Finally, this factual review of the courts also weighs heavily in costs for the parties, in that instead of having an abridged resolution of their disputes, the same is, in fact, lengthened, with resort to the CIAC becoming no more than an additional layer in the process, and its resolution of construction disputes no longer the alternative to litigation, but only the beginning.
 
Substantive Realignment towards 
 Deference to CIAC: 
 R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules
 
 Significantly, however, on July 28, 2003, this departure would be unequivocally corrected and realigned with the passing of R.A. 9285,
[56]
 also known as the Alternative Dispute Resolution Law of 2004. Preliminarily, telling are the exchanges during the deliberations of the House Committee on Justice of its provisions. Then deliberated as House Bill 5654, its records reflected the legislative desire to provide alternative modes of dispute resolution in order to provide dispute settlement machineries that are far removed from notoriously cumbersome judicial mechanisms, in order, for one, to decongest the courts' dockets: 
 
 THE CHAIRMAN [(Rep. Marcelino C. Libanan)]: x x x x
 
 x x x I think from the Philippine Judicial Academy who raised the issue on separation of powers. Nevertheless, it is the impression of the Chair that this is a very good bill and that this will de-clog our cases in our regular courts and so we have to pass this if possible this 12
th
 [C]ongress. 
 
 x x x x
 
 MR. ANTONIO M. MARTINEZ (Vice Chancellor, Philippine Judicial Academy): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
 Just like Atty. Pilando and Dean Parlade, I would like to voice out also the sentiments of the Judiciary on this aspect that we certainly welcome this bill. It is really a laudable piece of legislation and would, in effect, be a very helpful device to decongest the courts of [their] clogged dockets.
 
x x x x
 
 As a matter of fact, recently, we launched the mediation project in the appellate level. We hope that in due time, we will be able to eventually saturate all of the courts nationwide with mediators and will be able to help us in decongesting the clogged docket of court.
[57]
 
 
 
 R.A. 9285 was also designed to draw a broad and bright line between litigation and alternative resolutions of disputes, as was shown by the comment of the head of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators: 
 
 MR. MARIO VALDERAMA (Representative, Chartered Institute of Arbitrators): Thank you, Your Honor. 
 
 Now, now to go directly to the point, when we talked about ADR, Your Honor, please, we talk about party autonomy and of course the promotion of ADR is only the means resulting to the effect, among them, the declogging of courts, and probably, we can do something about the declaration of policy instead of promoting, merely promoting ADR, then probably, 
what would have to be upheld would be the autonomy of the parties insofar as their dispute resolution is concerned
. The thinking being that... since we are adults, with sufficient discretion, then we may... 
we should have the option of choosing whether to go to litigation or to go ADR
.
[58]
 
 
 
 Consistent with the above rationale for demarcating options for parties in dispute, as well as relieving the courts of the workload that may no longer necessitate litigation, Sections 34-40, Chapter 6 of R.A. 9285, on the governing laws over construction disputes, distinctly resolved all doubts in favor of the restrictive limitation of judicial review only to questions of law, and a categorical deference to the CIAC with respect to its findings of fact. 
 First, Section 34 positively provided for the return to E.O. 1008, as the original applicable law, which in turn rules out judicial review of the CIAC's factual determination, and exclusively provides that appeal may only be to the Court, and on the narrow limit of questions of law only: 
 
 
SEC. 34. Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law.
 - The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry Arbitration Law. 
 
 
 Second, evidencing the legislative intent to defer the threshing of facts to the CIAC and not the courts, Section 39 likewise fittingly provides that in the event that a trial court is notified of a construction arbitration clause between parties who are litigating before it, the court is bound to dismiss the case, unless the parties agree to the contrary: 
 
 
SEC. 39. Court to Dismiss Case Involving a Construction Dispute.
 - A regional trial court where a construction dispute is filed shall, upon becoming aware, not later than the pretrial conference, that the parties had entered into an arbitration to be conducted by the CIAC, unless both parties, assisted by their respective counsel, shall submit to the regional trial court a written agreement exclusive for the Court, rather than the CIAC, to resolve the dispute. 
 
 
 Finally, on September 1, 2009, for the avoidance of uncertainties as to where the line of review is drawn, the Supreme Court, through Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, issued Administrative Matter No. (A.M) 7-11-08-SC,
[59]
 also known as the Special ADR Rules, which definitively affirmed the bright-line rule on judicial restraint with regard to factual review. Undeniably clear are Rule 19.7 and 19.10 of the Special ADR Rules, which provide:

 - As a general rule, the court can only vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal upon a clear showing that the award suffers from any of the infirmities or grounds for vacating an arbitral award under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876 or under Rule 34 of the Model Law in a domestic arbitration, or for setting aside an award in an international arbitration under Article 34 of the Model Law, or for such other grounds provided under these Special Rules. 
 
 If the Regional Trial Court is asked to set aside an arbitral award in a domestic or international arbitration on, any ground other than those provided in the Special ADR Rules, the court shall entertain such ground for the setting aside or non-recognition of the arbitral award only if the same amounts to a violation of public policy. 
 
 
The court shall not set aside or vacate the award of the arbitral tribunal merely on the ground that the arbitral tribunal committed errors of fact, or of law, or of fact and law, as the court cannot
 
substitute its judgment for that of the arbitral tribunal. 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 In December of the same year, the Department of Justice (DOJ) likewise issued Department Circular No. 98,
[60]
 which resonated R.A. 9285's intent to restore E.O. 1008's pertinent provisions on the CIAC, as provided in Chapter 6 thereof: 
 
CHAPTER 6 
 ARBITRATION OF CONSTRUCTION DISPUTES
 
 
 The Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC), which has original and exclusive jurisdiction over arbitration of construction disputes pursuant to Executive Order No. 1008, s. 1985, otherwise known as the "Construction Industry Arbitration Law", shall promulgate the Implementing Rules and Regulations governing arbitration of construction disputes, incorporating therein the pertinent provisions of the ADR Act. 
 
 
 A slight, recent digression from this bright-line demarcation occurred in the 2011 amendment of CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration (CIAC Rules), specifically Section 18.2 thereof,
[61]
 which echoed Rule 43 of the Rules with respect to appeal of the CIAC award to the CA on questions of fact. 
 It is crucial to note, however, that the CIAC Rules only iterated the procedural license provided in Rule 43 of the Rules, which, as seen, was already reconsidered by R.A. 9285. 
 In the final analysis, it appears that a circumspect consideration of the evolution of laws illustrates that although the procedural rules have expanded the judicial review to include questions of fact, R.A. 9285 in 2003, as seconded by the Special ADR Rules in 2009, recalibrated said extent and restated the limit of the Court's review powers as to include only questions of law. 
 
Exceptions to the Rule on Pure Questions of Law
 Numerous cases decided both prior to and after the passage of R.A. 9285 have confirmed the persuasive authority of the CIAC in determining merits in a construction dispute. The vital role of the neutral expertise of the arbitral tribunal in such disputes has been underscored in a 2011 New York State Bar Report on the advantages of arbitration in the field of construction: 
 
 In arbitration, the experienced construction neutral requires much less "setting the stage" for the context of the dispute. He or she will understand substantive case law in the area, for instance case law regarding change orders, betterment, "quantum meruit" claims and other specialties of construction law. These concepts will not be "new" to the arbitrator so while time may be spent on describing the application of these laws to the particular case, the arbitrator will not need to be introduced to the concepts.
 
 An experienced construction arbitrator will also have the ability to understand complex construction disputes on a technical level. Construction disputes are usually resolved on the facts and the contract. In cases that haven't settled, there is often a disagreement on the facts and the contract. Was there a material delay by the engineer in approving shop drawings? Were the shop drawings complete? Do the disputed Change Orders actually represent work outside the scope of the contract? Were proper procedures followed during drilling? Does the contract promise payment for unanticipated sub-surface site conditions or not? Experienced arbitrators frequently commiserate that attorneys inexperienced in arbitration often spend their time proving the filings of character or ethics in the participants, while neglecting to address that which every arbitrator cares about, the facts and the contract. Construction cases do not deserve to be settled on emotion, but rather on a matrix of complex facts and contractual responsibilities.
[62]
 
 
 In related fashion, several notable decisions have illustrated how CIAC awards serve the premium of persuasive factual determination, but are nevertheless not insulated from judicial review on grounds that go into the integrity of the arbitral tribunal.
 In 
Metropolitan Cebu Water District v. Mactan Rock Industries, Inc
.,
[63]
 the Court repeated the early recognition of the peculiar nature of the construction industry as one that is considered "x x x vital for the fulfilment of national development goals x x x"
[64]
 and the corresponding need to have its disputes decided with dispatch. In similar import, in 
R.V. Santos Company, Inc. v. Belle Corporation
,
[65]
 the Court expounded on the deference to the factual findings of the CIAC, to wit: 
 
 Section 19 [of E.O. 1008] makes it crystal clear that questions of fact cannot be raised in proceedings before the Supreme Court â which is not a trier of facts â in respect of an arbitral award rendered under the aegis of the CIAC. 
Consideration of the animating purpose of voluntary arbitration in general, and arbitration under the aegis of the CIAC in particular, requires us to apply rigorously the above principle embodied in Section 19 that the Arbitral Tribunal's findings of fact shall be final and [u]nappealable.
 
 x x x x
 
 Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private purposes. 
The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal questions["]
. The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such arbitrators. 
The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the Arbitral Tribunal, save only where a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction. 
Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators. Any other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile institution.
 
 
 In another case, we have also held that: 
 
 It is settled that 
findings of fact of 
quasi
-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect
, but also finality, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. In particular, factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal.
[66]
 
 
 In 2015, in 
Philippine Race Horse Trainer's Association, Inc. v. Piedras Negras Construction and Development Corporation
[67]
 the Court found that the matters the parties brought for resolution essentially required factual determination, which it held must "rightly be left to the CIAC's sound expertise."
[68]
 Subsequently, in the case of 
Fruehauf Electronics Philippines Corporation v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation
,
[69]
 the Court upheld the autonomy of arbitral awards, and refrained from reviewing factual findings thereof, reasoning thus: 
 
 We have deliberately refrained from passing upon the merits of the arbitral award â not because the award was erroneous â but because it would be improper. None of the grounds to vacate an arbitral award are present in this case and as already established, the merits of the award cannot be reviewed by the courts.
 
 Our refusal to review the award is not a simple matter of putting procedural technicalities over the substantive merits of a case; it goes into the very legal substance of the issues. There is no law granting the judiciary authority to review the merits of an arbitral award. If we were to insist on reviewing the correctness of the award (
or consent to the CA's doing so
), it would be tantamount to expanding our jurisdiction without the benefit of legislation. This translates to judicial legislation â a breach of the fundamental principle of separation of powers.
 
 
The CA reversed the arbitral award â 
an action that it has no power to do
 â because it disagreed with the tribunal's factual findings and application of the law. 
However, the alleged incorrectness of the award is insufficient cause to vacate the award, given the 
State's policy of upholding the autonomy of arbitral awards
.
[70]
 
 
 More, in 
CE Construction Corporation v. Araneta Center, Inc
.,
[71]
 the Court was similarly inclined to refrain from reviewing the CIAC's factual conclusions, ruling in this wise: 
 
 x x x When their awards become the subject of judicial review, courts must defer to the factual findings borne by arbitral tribunals' technical expertise and irreplaceable experience of presiding over the arbitral process. Exceptions may be availing but only in instances when the integrity of the arbitral tribunal itself has been put in jeopardy. These grounds are more exceptional than those which are regularly sanctioned in Rule 45 petitions.
 
 x x x x
 
 The CIAC does not only serve the interest of speedy dispute resolution, it also facilitates 
authoritative
 
dispute resolution. Its authority proceeds not only from juridical legitimacy but equally from technical expertise. The creation of a special adjudicatory body for construction disputes presupposes distinctive and nuanced competence on matters that are conceded to be outside the innate expertise of regular courts and adjudicatory bodies concerned with other specialized fields. 
The CIAC has the state's confidence concerning the entire technical expanse of construction, defined in jurisprudence as "referring to all on-site works on buildings or altering structures, from land clearance through completion including excavation, erection and assembly and installation of components and equipment." 
 
 x x x x
 
 This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: there were those that enabled questions of fact; there were those that enabled questions of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law. Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals. 
However, in keeping with
 
the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any appeal from CIAC arbitral tribunals must remain limited to questions of law.
[72]
 
 
 In his 
Concurring Opinion
, Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen) adds on the rationale for the high degree of deference accorded to CIAC awards, to wit: 
 
 The CIAC serves the interest not only of speedy dispute resolution, but also of 
authoritative
 dispute resolution. It was created with a particular view of enabling "early and expeditious settlement of disputes" aware of the exceptional role of construction to "the furtherance of national development goals". x x x. 
 
 x x x x 
 
 
CE Construction
 further discussed how "[t]he creation of a special adjudicatory body for construction disputes presupposes distinctive and nuanced competence on matters that are conceded to be outside the innate expertise of regular courts and adjudicatory bodies concerned with other specialized fields." It drew attention to how the CIAC is a "quasi-judicial administrative agency equipped with the technical proficiency that enables it to efficiently and promptly resolve conflicts. x x x.
[73]
 
 
 This judicial restraint and deference was further reaffirmed in the subsequent cases of 
Metro Rail Transit Development, Corporation v. Gammon Philippines, Inc
.,
[74]
 
Camp John Hay Development Corporation v. Charter Chemical and Coating Corporation
[75]
 and 
Metro Bottled Water Corporation v. Andrada Construction & Development Corporation, Inc
.
[76]
 Far from being absolute, however, the general rule proscribing against judicial review of factual matters admits of exceptions, 
with the standing litmus test that which pertain to either a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal
, or otherwise an allegation of a violation of the Constitution or positive law
. The 2019 case of Tondo Medical Center v. Rante
[77]
 illustrates: 
 
 Thus, questions on 
whether the CIAC arbitral tribunals conducted their affairs in a haphazard and immodest manner that the most basic integrity of the arbitral process was imperiled
 are not insulated from judicial review. Thus: 
 
 
 x x x We reiterate the rule that 
factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal, except when the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under section nine of Republic Act No. 876 and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.
 x x x.
[78]
 
 
 
 In other words, the scenarios that will trigger a factual review of the CIAC's arbitral award must fall within either of the following sets of grounds: 
 
 
 
(1)
 
Challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal
 (
i.e
., (i) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (ii) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (iii) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (iv) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under 
Section 9 of R.A. 876
[79]
 or "The Arbitration Law", and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (v) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made) and; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
Allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law.
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the prototypical examples that exceptionally trigger a factual review of the CIAC's arbitral awards, the Court here discerns the merit in adding the otherwise forgotten presumption that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal may also be revisited by the Court upon an allegation that the arbitral tribunal committed an act that is violative of the Constitution or other positive laws. To abate fears, the delimitation discerned in the Court's power to review factual findings of the CIAC shall in no way plausibly allow for a situation wherein the Court's hand is stayed from correcting a blatant constitutional or legal violation because the autonomy of the arbitral process is paramount. Contrarily, the Court underscores that the contracted or very limited grounds for alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CIAC arbitral tribunal, however narrow, are still principally tethered to the courts' primary duty of upholding the Constitution and positive laws. The addition of the second ground makes plain that no amount of contracting or expanding grounds for grave abuse will ever be permitted to lay waste to the original purpose of the courts and their mandate to uphold the rule of law. 
 
 Given the above Court pronouncements on judicial restraint in favor of animating and upholding the autonomy of the CIAC, as well as the more reasonable exceptions that all only involve a determination of whether the arbitral award in question was tainted with a challenge on the integrity of the arbitrators themselves or otherwise a violation of the Constitution or positive law in the course of the arbitral process, the Court deems it high time to revisit prior decisions that include among the exceptions meriting a factual review the mere disagreement of the factual findings of the CA 
vis-Ã -vis
 those made by the CIAC, as in the oft-cited case of 
Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation
[80]
 and the more recent case of 
Shangri-La Properties, Inc. v. B.F. Corporation
.
[81]
 
 All told, the Court must now, sitting 
en banc
, inescapably re-weigh the applicable laws and harmonize them in order to make the pertinent rules consistent with the spirit of the law that gave form to the CIAC, along with the overriding and uncontroverted national policy of favoring the unfettered and enabled operations of the alternative modes of resolutions such as the CIAC. 
 
II - Mode of Appeal of CIAC awards vis-Ã -vis Constitutional Limitations
 
 Unmistakably, the tracing of the evolution of laws relating to judicial review of the CIAC awards as shown above demonstrates that the mode of appeal of the CIAC awards exists within a latticework of constitutional licenses and restraints. These constitutional parameters converge on three key points: (1) the prescriptive apportionment' of the powers and appellate jurisdictions of both the CA and the Court, (2) the correlated limitation on the Congress' power to determine and confer a court's jurisdiction, and (3) the limitations on the Court's rule-making power. These constitutional conditions bear upon the ultimate question of whether E.O. 1008, as echoed by the R.A. 9285, validly provided for a direct resort to this Court for appeals on the CIAC awards. 
 The Court here deems it fit that navigating these constitutional considerations be informed, foremost, by the spirit of the CIAC Charter and the CIAC's primary function and design, with the end in view of clearing road blocks where the Constitution and other laws have placed none. 
 The construction industry necessitates the constant and supported availability of speedier and more efficient modes of resolving disputes precisely because of the very nature of the industry itself, where an unsettled dispute can easily run projects to the ground with serious delays and irreparable damage. Major international construction projects typically opt for arbitration as the final tier of dispute resolution for a variety of reasons that serve the parties' interest best, with courts limited to a supportive role.
[82]
 The fundamental advantage of arbitration over litigation in the specialized context of a construction dispute goes into the general flexibility of tailoring the resolution of disputes in a way that serves nuanced business priorities.
[83]
 Arbitration also allows players in this highly competitive and collaborative industry to realize their intentions of resolving conflicts while avoiding courts and preserving professional relationships: 
 
 In each of its niches, construction cases can involve a number of contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers and design professionals. Mediation with a knowledgeable industry professional can not only resolve the dispute, but resolve the dispute with a consensus regarding the cause of the dispute that allows the parties to accept responsibility for their respective obligations. 
 
 This can lead to a resolution of the conflict which helps maintain relationships and allows companies to work together again.
[84]
 
 
 With benefits to parties that include the cost and time-efficient process facilitated by neutral and qualified decision makers or the "knowledgeable neutral" which are typically architects, engineers or other industry professionals,
[85]
 the availability of arbitration as a mode for resolving construction disputes in the country has served as the impetus for the chartering of the CIAC. Primarily grounded on matters of policy, the CIAC was created precisely to forestall delays that resolution of construction disputes encounters in court litigation, with the recognized net effect of frustrating national development.
[86]
 After recapturing the original legislative intent inclined towards promoting arbitration in the area of the CIAC awards, it is next incumbent upon this Court to determine 
with a firm degree of finality and conclusiveness
 whether that precedent design was carried out with procedural and substantive validity, and ultimately whether it cleared all the relevant constitutional hurdles and conditions. 
 
Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court
 The first constitutional limitation that the CIAC's direct appeal to the Court must hurdle is the constitutionally detailed jurisdiction of the Court. Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution outlines the powers of the Judiciary, and Section 5(2) thereof prescribed the Court's appellate jurisdiction, to wit: 
 
 
Section 5.
 The Supreme Court shall have the following powers: 
 
 x x x x
 
 (2) Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal or 
certiorari
, as the law or the Rules of Court may provide, final judgments and orders of lower courts in: 
 
 
 (a) All cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question. 
 
 (b) All cases involving the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or toll, or any penalty imposed in relation thereto. 
 
 (c) All cases in which the jurisdiction of any lower court is in issue.
 
 (d) All criminal cases in which the penalty imposed is 
reclusion perpetua
 or higher. 
 
 (e) All cases in which only an error or question of law is involved. 
 
 
 x x x x.
 
 
 Section 5(2), Article VIII has also been considered textually exclusive to courts and does not contemplate quasi-judicial bodies.
[87]
 In 
Fabian v. Desierto
[88]
 (
Fabian
), the Solicitor General invoked the application of this provision to support its argument that Section 27
[89]
 of R.A. 6770 does not increase the Court's appellate jurisdiction, as the Court already has jurisdiction over questions of law by virtue of Section 5(2)(e), Article VIII of the Constitution. This argument was, however, rejected by the Court, which interpreted this constitutional grant of appellate jurisdiction to cover only "courts composing the integrated judicial system":
[90]
 
 
 We are not impressed by this discourse. It overlooks the fact that by jurisprudential developments over the years, this Court has allowed appeals by [
certiorari
] under Rule 45 in a substantial number of cases and instances even if questions of fact are directly involved and have to be resolved by the appellate court. Also, the very provision cited by petitioner specifies that the appellate jurisdiction of this Court contemplated therein is to be exercised over "final judgments and orders of 
lower courts
," that is, the courts composing the integrated judicial system. It does not include the quasi-judicial bodies or agencies, hence 
whenever
 
the legislature intends that the decisions or resolutions of the quasi-judicial agency shall be reviewable by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, a specific provision to that effect is included in the law creating that quasi-judicial agency and, for that matter, any special statutory court
. No such provision on appellate procedure is required for the regular courts of the integrated judicial system because they are what are referred to and already provided for, in Section 5, Article VIII of the Constitution:
[91]
 
 
 Further, this constitutionally determined appellate jurisdiction is prescribed as the minimum breadth of the Court's jurisdiction, as Section 2, Article VIII provides that Congress may not diminish the apportioned appellate jurisdiction of the Court: 
 
 
Section 2.
 The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts but may not deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over cases enumerated in Section 5 hereof. 
 
 No law shall be passed reorganizing the Judiciary when it undermines the security of tenure of its Members. 
 
 
 In elucidating on the operative interaction of Section 2, Article VIII of the Constitution with Section 5(2), Article VIII, the Court in 
Morales v. Court of Appeals
[92]
 (
Morales
) held that:
 
 
 Jurisdiction is, of course, conferred by the Constitution or by Congress. 
Outside the cases enumerated in Section 5(2) of Article VIII of the Constitution, Congress has the plenary power to define, prescribe and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts.
 Accordingly, Congress may, by law, provide that a certain class of cases should be exclusively heard and determined by one court. Such would be a special law and 
must be construed as an exception to the general law on jurisdiction of courts, namely, the Judiciary Act of 1948 as amended, or the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980. In short, the special law prevails over the general law
.
[93]
 
 
 This same constitutionally prescribed appellate jurisdiction of the Court is, however, not incapable of increase, for as long as the Court's advice and concurrence under Section 30, Article VI are secured: 
 
 
Section 30.
 No law shall be passed increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution without its advice and concurrence.
 
 
 Stated differently, Congress may pass a law that increases the Court's jurisdiction, but not one which decreases it. In case of a law increasing the Court's appellate jurisdiction, such would only violate the constitutional proscription under Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution if it increases the appellate jurisdiction of 
this Court
, not lower courts, without the former's advice and concurrence.
 Proceeding from the doctrine in 
Morales
, it follows that by the legislation of E.O. 1008, as reiterated by R.A. No, 9285, which articulated the law's intent to provide a direct route of appeal from the CIAC to this Court, Congress effectively increased the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to include awards of the CIAC. This increase in appellate jurisdiction, in turn, brings to fore the question of whether the requisite advice and concurrence of the Court under Section 30, Article VI were triggered.
 Thus, the first question distilled for the Court is whether the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court was an effective increase of the Court's appellate jurisdiction which therefore required the Court's blessing through its advice and concurrence. 
 The Court finds that there was no such increase in the Court's jurisdiction that required such concurrence. It is decisive to remember that when the 1987 Constitution was created, the Court was already enjoying the jurisdiction over appeal from CIAC awards on pure questions of law, as conferred to it by Congress for two years, by its passage of E.O. 1008. The direct resort to this Court from the CIAC awards on purely legal questions was an increase of the Court's jurisdiction that was already in place prior to the 1987 Constitution's Article VIII, Section 30 which required this Court's advice and concurrence. 
 To be sure, when E.O. 1008 was enacted in 1980, no such condition of the Court's advice and concurrence was required anywhere in the 1973 Constitution, and hence at that time, no such concurrence was needed. With the earlier 1935 Constitution, under Section 2, Article VIII thereof, Congress was expressly authorized to define and determine the Court's jurisdiction, without foreclosing the authority to 
increase the same
, the only limitation being against any 
diminishing
 of the existing jurisdiction conferred upon it, to wit: 
 
ARTICLE VIII

 SECTION 2. 
The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts, but may not deprive the Supreme Court of its original jurisdiction over cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, nor of its jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal,

, or writ of error, as the law or the rules of court may provide, final judgments and decrees of inferior courts
 in â
 
 
 (1) All cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, law, ordinance, or executive order or regulation is in question.
 
 (2) All cases involving the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or toll, or any penalty imposed in relation thereto.
 
 (3) All cases in which the jurisdiction of any trial court is in issue. 
 
(4) All criminal cases in which the penalty imposed is death or life imprisonment.
 
 (5) All cases in which an error or question of law is involved.
 
 
 SECTION 3.

[94]
 
 
 Similarly, the 1973 Constitution likewise granted Congress with the authority to define and apportion the Court's jurisdiction, with the sole limitation that its jurisdiction be not diminished. Section 1, Article X, in relation to Section 5 provided:

(3) Assign temporarily judges of inferior courts to other stations as public interest may require. Such temporary assignment shall not last longer than six months without the consent of the judge concerned. 
 
 (4) Order a change of venue or place of trial to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 
 
 (5) Promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, and the integration of the Bar, which, however, may be repealed, altered or supplemented by the Batasang Pambansa. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. 
 
(6) Appoint its officials and employees in accordance with the Civil Service Law.
[95]
 
 
 
 Demonstrably, the 1973 Constitution and its immediate predecessor allowed Congress to apportion the Court's jurisdiction, without any concomitant requirement of the Court's prior acceptance or subsequent concurrence. It stands to undeniable reason therefore that when E.O. 1008 vested this Court with the direct and exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from CIAC awards, the Court's jurisdiction was increased without any need for it to first accede to said increase. 
 With all the constitutional conditions met for enabling a direct appeal to the Court, the next question for the Court's determination is the proper remedial route through which the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court may be submitted. 
 Based on the prior discussions, appeal from the CIAC awards may no longer be filed under Rule 43. This leaves only appeal by 
certiorari
 under Rule 45, which provides: 
 
RULE 45
 
 
Appeal by Certiorari to the Supreme Court
 
 
 
SECTION 1. 
Filing of Petition with Supreme Court
. â A party desiring to appeal by 
certiorari
 from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on 
certiorari
. The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. (1a, 2a) 
 
 
 As it stands, Rule 45 contemplates only appeals from final judgments and orders of 
lower courts
, and does not include quasi-judicial bodies or agencies. This differs from the former Rule 45 of the 1964 Rules of Court which made mention only of the CA, and had to be adopted in statutes creating and providing for appeals from certain administrative or quasi-judicial agencies whenever the purpose was to restrict the scope of the appeal to questions of law. 
 In furtherance of the animating basis for the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court, CIAC awards may reasonably be considered as an exemption to Rule 45's exclusive contemplation of lower courts. An interpretation otherwise would create a scenario where a procedural limitation, which may be hurdled, 
i.e
., jurisdiction may be increased provided it complies with Section 30, Article VI, operatively prevails over a substantive intendment to the contrary provided by no less than the CIAC's very own charter. Given the unique import of the CIAC's design as a specialized and expedient mode of resolving construction disputes with persuasive finality, its substantive design must be granted primacy over procedural rules that, as will be discussed further, place no insurmountable obstacle before it. 
 
 
Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals as provided by Batas Pambansa Blg. 129
 
 
 
 
With the increase in the Court's appellate jurisdiction found valid, the next constitutional condition that confronts this issue is whether E.O. 1008, issued on February 4, 1985, violated Batas Pambansa Blg. (B.P) 129,
[96]
 which was earlier passed on August 14, 1981 and amended by R.A. 7902,
[97]
 on February 23, 1995,
[98]
 when E.O. 1008 provided for the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court, particularly, Section 9(3), Chapter I of B.P. 129, which provides: 
 
 SEC. 9. 
Jurisdiction
. - The Court of Appeals shall [e]xercise: 
 
 (1) Original jurisdiction to issue writs of 
mandamus
, prohibition, 
certiorari, habeas corpus
, and 
quo warranto
, and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction; 
 
 (2) Exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments of Regional Trial Courts; and
 
 (3) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgements, resolutions, orders or awards of 
Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commission
, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Employees Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, [e]xcept those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph 4 of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. 
 
 The Court of Appeals shall have the power to try cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary to resolve factual issues raised in cases falling within its original and appellate jurisdiction, including the power to grant and conduct new trials or further proceedings. Trial or hearings in the Court of Appeals must be continuous and must be completed within three (3) months, unless extended by the Chief Justice. (
As amended by R.A. No. 7902
.) (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 This appellate jurisdiction of the CA is likewise textually exclusive. Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules echoes the grant of this appellate jurisdiction to the CA, 
to wit
: 
 
 
SECTION 1.
 
Scope.
 â This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any 
quasiÂ­judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions
. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, 
Construction Industry Arbitration Commission
, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law. (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 The language of the enumeration of quasi-judicial tribunals under Section 9(3) of B.P. 129, on the other hand, indicates that it is not an exclusive list, so that if the enabling statute of a tribunal, later found to be a quasi-judicial agency, does not categorically provide for an aggrieved party's judicial recourse, Section 9(3) of B.P. 129 seems to serve to fill the gap.
[99]
 In a number of cases, this Court has relied on Section 9(3) of B.P. 129 to designate the CA, 
via 
Rule 43, as the proper court to which appeals from quasi-judicial agencies should be made, in spite of laws vesting jurisdiction directly to the Court. In 
First Lepanto Ceramics, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
,
[100]
 involving Article 82 of E.O. 226, which provided for a direct appeal from the decisions or final orders of the Board of Investments directly with the Court, this Court ruled that Circular 1-91, which implements B.P. 129 with respect to appeals to the CA from final orders or decisions of the quasiÂ­ judicial agencies, is controlling over said provision of E.O. 226. 
 In 
Carpio v. Sulu Resources Development Corporation
,
[101]
 which involved the application of Section 79 of R.A. 7942,
[102]
 which states that decisions of the Mines' Adjudication Board (MAB) may be reviewed by this Court through a petition for review by 
certiorari
, the Court found that because said law increased its appellate jurisdiction without its concurrence, appeals from decisions of the MAB shall be taken to the CA through Rule 43 of the Rules, in accordance with B.P. 129, Circular No. 1-91, and its rule-making power under the Constitution.
 Still particularly with respect to the CIAC awards, this Court categorized the CIAC in 
Metro Construction, Inc. v. Chatham Properties, Inc
.
[103]
 (
Chatham
) as a quasi-judicial agency. There it held that arbitral awards may be brought to the CA, pursuant to Circular No. 1-91, which provided a uniform procedure for appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. The Court also ruled that said circular, together with B.P. 129, as amended by R.A. 7902, Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, and Rule 43 of the Rules, effectively modified E.O. 1008.
[104]
 Consequently, the appeals from arbitral awards of the CIAC were also deemed to cover questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law.
[105]
 This apparent conflict between B.P. 129 and R.A. 9285, with respect to the mode of appeal of the CIAC awards, presents the Court with the overdue opportunity to crystallize with doctrinal precedent which between the two laws must prevail. 
 On this point and in accordance with the elementary statutory construction principles of precedence of specific laws over general laws, and later laws over earlier laws, this Court rules that R.A. 9285 prevails over B.P. 129, as the former enjoys preference over the latter with respect to both temporal precedence as well as that of greater degree of particularity. 
 First, with respect to superiority in time, it is a canon of statutory construction that in case of conflict between two laws, one a later law and the other an earlier law, the later law prevails as the prevailing law, being the most current articulation of legislative intent. As applied to the case at bar, B.P. 129 is also an earlier law, 1980 vintage, whereas E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285 are later laws, E.O. 1008 having been promulgated five years after B.P. 129, and R.A. 9285, which iterated E.O. 1008, being issued in 2004. Therefore, E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285, as laws that were promulgated subsequent to B.P. 129 and are the later expressions of the legislative will 106 on the matter of CIAC's awards' mode of appeal, must prevail over B.P. 129, thereby carving out CIAC awards as an exception to the CA's appellate jurisdiction over appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. 
 Second, with respect to the level of specificity in its application, the statutory canon that also finds bearing in this case is the canon of 
generalia specialibus non derogant
, or a general law does not nullify a specific or special law,
[107]
 which provides that where two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one designed therefor should prevail.
[108]
 It is a rule of statutory construction that a special law prevails over a general law â regardless of their dates of passage â and the special law is to be considered as an exception to the general law.
[109]
 In the earlier case of 
Valera v. Tuason, Jr.
 ,
[110]
 the Court explained the rationale of the hierarchy of laws, to wit: 
 
 x x x A special law is not regarded as having been amended or repealed by a general law unless the intent to repeal or alter is manifest. 
Generalia specialibus non derogant
. And this is true although the terms of the general act are broad enough to include the matter in the special statute. ([
Manila Railroad Company v. Rafferty
] , 40 Phil., 224.) 
At any rate, in the event harmony between provisions of this type in the same law or in two laws is impossible, the specific provision controls unless the statute, considered in its entirely, indicates a contrary intention upon the part of the legislature.
 Granting then that the two laws cannot be reconciled, in so far as they are inconsistent with each other, [S]ection 73 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being a specific law, should prevail over, or be considered as an exception to [S]ection 211 of the Administrative Code, which is a provision of general character. A general law is one which embraces a class of subjects or places and does not omit any subject or place naturally belonging to such class, while a special act is one which relates to particular persons or things of a class.
[111]
 
 
 A more acute case in point, involving a demonstration of a presidential decree carving out an exception in the jurisdictions conferred under B.P. 129, is the case of 
Tomawis v. Balindong
.
[112]
 Here, the Court settled the issue of jurisdiction over appeals from the Shari'a District Court, and ruled that B.P. 129 was enacted to reorganize only existing civil courts and is a law of general application to the judiciary, whereas P.D. 1083 is a special law that only applies to Shari'a courts, and therefore must prevail in application to Shari 'a courts over the former, 
viz
.: 
 
 We have held that a general law and a special law on the same subject are statutes in 
pari materia
 and should be 
read together and harmonized
, if possible, with a view to giving effect to both. In the instant case, we apply the principle 
generalia specialibus non derogant
. A
 general law does not nullify a special law. The general law will yield to the special law in the specific and particular subject embraced in the latter. We must read and construe [B.P.] 129 and [P.D.] 1083 together, then by taking [P.D.] 1083 as an exception to the general law to reconcile the two laws. 
This is so since the legislature has not made any express repeal or modification of [P.D.] 1083, and it is well-settled that repeals of statutes by implication are not favored. Implied repeals will not be declared unless the intent of the legislators is manifest. Laws are assumed to be passed only after careful deliberation and with knowledge of all existing ones on the subject, and it follows that the legislature did not intend to interfere with or abrogate a former law relating to the same subject matter.
[113]
 
 
 A more recent application of this basic principle of statutory construction is in the case of 
Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v. Bureau of Internal Revenue
:
[114]
 
 
 x x x The Legislature consider and make provision for all the circumstances of the particular case. 
The Legislature having specially considered all of the facts and circumstances in the particular case in granting a special charter, it will not be considered that the Legislature, by adopting a general law containing provisions repugnant to the provisions of the charter, and without making any mention of its intention to amend or modify the charter, intended to amend, repeal, or modify the special act.
 (
Lewis [v.] Cook County
, 74 Ill. App., 151; 
Philippine Railway Co. [v.] Nolting
, 34 Phil., 401).
[115]
 
 
 Bringing the case at bar through this second frame of statutory construction, the Court finds that with respect to the level of generality or specialty, B.P. 129 is a general law of procedure and jurisdiction, and must therefore yield to the more specific laws of E.O. 1008 and its iteration in R.A. 9285, which distinctively pertain to the CIAC and other alternative modes of arbitration. 
 In other words, this reconciliation of laws and rules stands on the uncontroverted premise that when E.O. 1008 conferred on this Court the jurisdiction over appeals from CIAC awards, said conferment survived the subsequent 
procedural
 digressions, so that R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules needed no Court concurrence, for they could no more restore to this Court a jurisdiction that it never validly lost. 
Stated differently, when R.A. 9285 reiterated the direct recourse of appeals from CIAC awards to this Court, it did not endow the Court with any new jurisdiction that it did not already have as validly apportioned to it as early as 1980. 
There is therefore no need for the Court's concurrence as required under the 1987 Constitution, as there was, in fact, no 
increase
 to concur with. 
 Pursuant to these two canons of reconciling apparent conflicts in application of laws, it inevitably appears that with respect to the conferment of jurisdiction to the CA of appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards, both E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285 have sufficiently carved CIAC awards as an exception therefrom. 
 
Exclusive Rule-Making Power of the Court
 The third and final circumscription that CIAC's awards' mode of appeal to the Court must consider is the relation of the power of Congress under Section 2, Article VIII 
vis-Ã -vis 
Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution, with regard to the rule-making power of the Court. Section 5(5), Article VIII provides: 
 
 
Section 5
. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:
 
 x x x x
 
 
 
(5)
 
Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court. 
 
 
 
x x x x.
 
 
 Presently, Congress does not have the power to repeal, alter, or supplement the rules of the Court concerning pleading, practice, and procedure. In 
Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice
[116]
 the evolution of the rule-making power of the Court was laid down, and its discussion was later iterated in 
Estipona, Jr. v. Lobrigo
[117]
 where it was held that: 
 
 While the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts is, by constitutional design, vested unto Congress, the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts belongs exclusively to this Court under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution x x x. 
 
 x x x x 
 
 The separation of powers among the three co[-]equal branches of our government has erected an impregnable wall that keeps the power to promulgate rules of pleading, practice and procedure within the sole province of this Court. The other branches trespass upon this prerogative if they enact laws or issue orders that effectively repeal, alter or modify any of the procedural rules promulgated by the Court.
 Viewed from this perspective, We have rejected previous attempts on the part of the Congress, in the exercise of its legislative power, to amend the Rules of Court [x x x], to wit:
 
 
 
1. 
Fabian v. Desierto
 â Appeal from the decision of the Office of the Ombudsman in an administrative disciplinary case should be taken to the Court of Appeals under the provisions of Rule 43 of the 
Rules
 instead of appeal by 
certiorari 
under Rule 45 as provided in Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770.
 
 
 2.
 Cathay Metal Corporation v. Laguna West Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc
. â The Cooperative Code provisions on notices cannot replace the rules on summons under Rule 14 of the Rules. 
 
 3. 
RE: Petition for Recognition of the Exemption of the GSIS from Payment of Legal Fees; Baguio Market Vendors Multi-Purpose Cooperative (BAMARVEMPCO) v. Hon. Judge Cabato-Cortes; In Re: Exemption of the National Power Corporation from Payment of Filing/Docket Fee; and Rep. of the Phils. v. Hon. Mangotara, et al
. â Despite statutory provisions, the GSIS, BAMARVEMPCO, and NPC are not exempt from the payment of legal fees imposed by Rule 141 of the 
Rules
. 
 
 4. 
Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals (Sixth Division)
 â The first paragraph of Section 14 of R.A. No. 6770, which prohibits courts except the Supreme Court from issuing temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin an investigation conducted by the Ombudsman, is unconstitutional as it contravenes Rule 58 of the 
Rules
. 
 
 Considering that the aforesaid laws effectively modified the Rules, this Court asserted its discretion to amend, repeal or even establish new rules of procedure, to the exclusion of the legislative and executive branches of government. To reiterate, the Court's authority to promulgate rules on pleading, practice, and procedure is exclusive and one of the safeguards of Our institutional independence.
[118]
 
 
 Balanced against the authority of Congress to grant or define the jurisdiction of courts, the rule-making power of the Court is proscribed against promulgating rules that diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. 
 In 
Fabian
, the question was raised as to whether the Court, in holding that the CA is the proper court to review the final judgements of quasi-judicial agencies even in light of a law vesting the Court with the power to do so, would be disregarding a substantive right. The Court ruled in the negative, explaining in this wise: 
 
 x x x This brings to fore the question of whether Section 27 of [R.A.] 6770 is substantive or procedural. 
 
 It will be noted that no definitive line can be drawn between those rules or statutes which are procedural, hence within the scope of this Court's rule-making power, and those which are substantive. 
In fact, a particular rule may be procedural in one context and substantive in another.
 It is admitted that what is procedural and what is substantive is frequently a question of great difficulty. It is not, however, an insurmountable problem if a rational and pragmatic approach is taken within the context of our own procedural and jurisdictional system. 
 
 In determining whether a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the practice and procedure of the lower courts, abridges, enlarges, or modifies any substantive right, the test is 
whether the rule really regulates procedure, that is, the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for a disregard or infraction of them. If the rule takes away a vested right, it is not procedural. If the rule creates a right such as the right to appeal, it may be classified as a substantive matter; but if it operates as a means of implementing an existing right then the rule deals merely with procedure.
 
 
 In the situation under consideration, a transfer by the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its rule-making power, of pending cases involving a review of decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary actions to the Court of Appeals which shall now be vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction thereover, relates to procedure only. 
This is so because it is not the right to appeal of an aggrieved party which is affected by the law. That 
right
 has been preserved. Only the 
procedure
 by which the appeal is to be made or decided has been changed. The rationale for this is that no litigant has a vested right in a particular remedy, which may be changed by substitution without impairing vested rights, hence he can have none in rules of procedure which relate to the remedy.
 
 
 Furthermore, it cannot be said that the transfer of appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals in this case is an act of creating a new right of appeal because such power of the Supreme Court to transfer appeals to subordinate appellate courts is purely a procedural and not a substantive power. Neither can we consider such transfer as impairing a vested right because the parties have still a remedy and still a competent tribunal to administer that remedy.
[119]
 
 
 In 
Fabian
, the Court went on to elucidate that the transfer by this Court, in the exercise of its rule-making power, of pending cases involving a review of decisions of the Ombudsman (OMB) in administrative disciplinary actions to the CA which shall now be vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over these, relates to 
procedure only
. This is so because it is not the right to appeal of an aggrieved party which is affected by the law, as that 
right
 has been preserved, with only the 
procedure
 by which the appeal is to be made or decided changed. 
 A sharp distinction on the matter of the effect of the rule pulls the case of CIAC awards far from that of 
Fabian
, as in the latter, the Court's act of transferring appellate jurisdiction over the OMB decisions to the CA did not undermine or significantly alter the party's right to appeal. 
 In clear contrast, the Court's act of including CIAC awards among those situations the appeal from which must be brought before the CA 
via
 Rule 43, instead of on a direct recourse to it as specified under E.O. 1008, did not provide a 
mere
 procedure of appeal of CIAC awards, 
but correspondingly diminished the substantive rights of parties who, pre-conflict, had elected arbitration as their speedier recourse in case of dispute
. 
 The compelling weight of the preservation of the speed, autonomy and finality of CIAC awards is best validated by the kind of tailor-made fit with which the design of arbitration serves the unique demands of the construction industry. 
Parties in construction disputes have also been known to predictably choose arbitration over litigation due to the limitation of the right to appeal thereto, particularly in that laws of many jurisdictions permit appeals of arbitral awards only on limited grounds
. 
 Demonstrably, construction is a specialized industry with projects that are prone to disputes owing to multiple parties, performance standards, as well as financing and profit considerations.
[120]
 The construction businesses' resort to alternative modes of resolution that seek to settle controversies as opposed to pursuit of lawsuits was even called a paradigm shift, which resulted from the wave of increasing need for dispute resolutions, and the inversely proportional decrease of incentives for litigation.
[121]
 Parties in construction disputes were afforded, by legislation, with the alternative route to an expedited and authoritative resolution of their disputes. The availability of this conclusive alternative mode, which had been hailed as the preferred method of resolving high-value disputes, is vital to the growth of the construction industry, and diluting the same undoubtedly amounts to the diminishing of the parties' substantive right. 
 
Once more, the substantive right is contained in the parties' preference to avail of speed, flexibility, cost efficiency and industry knowledge to obtain the most autonomous arbitration result possible.
 Autonomous arbitration is one which is initiated, conducted and concluded without any need or desire for judicial intervention,
[122]
 with the United States Supreme Court even affirming early on that the unmistakable purpose of Congress in affording parties with the arbitration procedure was so that the resolution of the dispute between parties who opt for arbitration be "speedy and not subject to delay and obstruction of the courts".
[123]
 The paradigm of autonomy likewise gives the parties the confidence to invite specialists to resolve complex issues which are beyond the proficiency of court judges.
 
This substantive right to access this arbitration autonomy
 is unambiguously subverted by the Court's overreaching exercise of its rule-making power, in its act of delegating to the CA what the legislative wisdom otherwise categorically conferred directly and exclusively upon this Court. The defeat of this right is evident in the frustration of the reasons that prompted the parties to choose arbitration over litigation in the first place. More particularly, the inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 weakened if not altogether destroyed the authoritative autonomy of the CIAC, as well as eroded if not totally obliterated its very nature as the expedited, economical, independent alternative dispute resolution to the otherwise protracted and costly court litigation. 
 To be sure, the inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 is a clear 
impairment
 of the central substantive right which animates the overall design of the CIAC, and is therefore invalid for overstepping the positive limitation of the rule-making power of this Court under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution on non-modification of substantive rights. Thus, nothing prevents this Court from correcting this over-inclusion, as it now does in the case at bar. 
 In all, the nexus between the judiciary and the arbitral tribunal is nothing short of paradoxical, in that on the one hand, the courts often ensure the integrity of the arbitration, but on the other, the apprehensions regarding court involvement have precisely led parties to opt for arbitration, in the first instance.
[124]
 As the case at bar exhibits, perhaps the point has always been not complete severance between the two, but only a guarantee that judicial involvement is limited to a minimum to promote the rationale of arbitration, so that it is not so much judicial control, as it is judicial encouragement through restraint.
 All told and reconciled, the Court sitting 
en banc
 takes this overdue opportunity to straighten out the route that an appeal from a CIAC arbitral award may take, and inevitably carve its remedial recourse out of procedural tiers that are wholly inconsistent with the very 
animus
 of this arbitral tribunal.
 A harmonization of these conflicting rules leaves the Court with the conclusion that the inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 appeals is without footing in the legal history of the CIAC, and therefore must be unequivocally reversed.
 More specifically, the Court holds that the direct recourse of an appeal of a CIAC award on questions of law directly to this Court is the rule, pursuant to E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285, notwithstanding Rule 43 on the CA's jurisdiction over quasi-judicial agencies, and Rule 45 in its exclusive application to lower courts. Thus, an appeal from an arbitral award of the CIAC may take either of two tracks, as determined by the subject matter of the challenge.
 On the one hand, if the parties seek to challenge a finding of law of the tribunal, then the same may be appealed only to this Court under Rule 45. To determine whether a question is one of law which 
may
 be brought before the Court under Rule 45, it is useful to recall that a question of law involves a doubt or controversy as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, as opposed to a question of fact which involves a doubt or difference that arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts, or when the query necessarily calls for a review and reevaluation of the whole evidence, including the credibility of witnesses, existence of specific surrounding circumstances, and the decided probabilities of the situation.
[125]
 The test here is not the party's characterization of the question before the Court, but whether the Court may resolve the issue brought to it by solely inquiring as to whether the law was properly applied and without going into a review of the evidence.
 On the other hand, if the parties seek to challenge the CIAC's finding of fact, the same may only be allowed under either of two premises, namely assailing the very integrity of the composition of the tribunal, or alleging the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law, in which cases the appeal may be filed before the CA on these limited grounds through the special civil action of a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65, in accordance with Section 4 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules: 
 
 
SECTION 1. 
Petition for certiorari
. â When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require. 
 
 The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof, copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a sworn certification of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of section 3, Rule 46. (1a) 
 
 
SEC. 4.
 
When and where petition filed
. â The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion. 
 
 The petition shall be filed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided by law or these Rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals. 
 
 In election cases involving an act or omission of a municipal or a regional trial court, the petition shall be filed exclusively with the Commission on Elections in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. (

.) 
 
 
 As observed by Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo (Chief Justice Gesmundo) during the deliberations, it would be entirely unsupported for appeal under Rule 43 to remain available for CIAC awards after a clear demonstration to the contrary. 
 Furthermore, Justice Leonen, in his 
Concurring Opinion
, sharply summarizes the utter lack of basis in this erroneous inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 appeals, which he calls out to be an "unfortunate mistake": 
 
 Since the Construction Industry Arbitration Law's adoption in 1985, procedural law and related jurisprudence have made it appear that appeals may also be taken to the Court of Appeals. There, the factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may supposedly be assailed. This has been an unfortunate mistake. 
The Court of Appeal's supposed appellate jurisdiction to freely review factual issues finds no basis in substantive law.
 
 
 x x x x
 
 It is opportune to repudiate the mistaken notion that appeals on questions of fact of CIAC awards may be coursed through the Court of Appeals. No statute actually vests jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals to entertain petitions for review emanating from the CIAC. 
Metro Construction
's reference to a "procedural mutation" effected by Circular No. 1-91, 1095 and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure do not broaden the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Neither do the amendments introduced to Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 by Republic Act No. 7902 effect a broadening of the Court of Appeals' appellate jurisdiction thereby extending it to a factual review of CIAC arbitral awards.
[126]
 
 
 
 The resort to Rule 65, instead of Rule 43, further finds support in the very nature of the factual circumstances which trigger said exceptional factual reviewâthose that center not on the actual findings of fact but on the integrity of the tribunal that makes these findings, or their compliance with the Constitution or positive law, 
i.e
., any of the following factual allegations: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under Section 9 of R.A. 876, and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.
[127]
 These are the scenarios that Chief Justice Gesmundo, keenly referred to as "tribunal-centered" and not "fact-centered" which must necessarily reframe whether the CA may or may not review the decisions of the CIAC, to wit: 
 
 If a legal remedy exists for the review of factual findings of the arbitral tribunal in the context of assailing the integrity of its composition, the question that should be asked is, should the subject matter of the appeal pertain to the alleged errors in the factual findings of the arbitral tribunal, or should the appeal center on the lack of integrity of the composition of the arbitral tribunal? Definitely, if there is no question on the integrity of the composition of the arbital tribunal, its award may not be subject to appeal on factual considerations. Consequently, the remedy contemplated is tribunal-centered and not fact-centered. This issue is important because it will determine whether the CA has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal in the first place.
[128]
 
 
 Proceeding from this framing of factual issues which fall within the narrow window of the Court's factual review of CIAC awards, the Court holds that these challenges to the CIAC tribunal's integrity or allegations of constitutional or statutory violations on the part of the arbitral tribunal, as further enumerated under Section 24
[129]
 of R.A. 876, partake of the nature of imputations of grave abuse which more accurately belong within the purview of a special civil action of a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65. Stated differently, the Court recognizes, as earlier distilled in jurisprudence, that although the challenges to the integrity of the CIAC arbitral tribunal are first enumerated in Section 24 of R.A. 876, the same grounds are also descriptive of the narrow set of situations that may warrant the Court's review of the same, as an exception to the more general rule that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal are beyond review. Once more, as correctly noted by Chief Justice Gesmundo, this appears to be the Court's understanding in its discussion of the said grounds in the case of 
HiÂ­ Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc
.
[130]
 (
Hi-Precision
), when it reiterated that it will not relitigate issues of fact previously resolved by an arbitral tribunal, save for the instance of a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, citing as examples thereof those very instances referred to under Section 24 of R.A. 876, 
viz.
: 
 
 Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private purposes. The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal questions." The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such arbitrators. The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the Arbitral Tribunal, save only where 
a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction
. Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators. Any other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile institution.
[131]
 
 
 
 Collectively, these factual scenarios, when alleged, essentially challenge the integrity of the arbitral tribunal or the constitutionality or legality of the conduct of the arbitral process, and therefore warrant an entertainment of doubt with respect to the factual findings of said tribunal. These factual allegations, which replicate the grounds for vacating an arbitral award as provided in Section 24 of R.A. 876, have been found by the Court to be the same factual allegations that will trigger an exceptional factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, as this Court has laid down in S
pouses David v. Construction Industry and Arbitration Commission
,
[132]
 
CE Construction Corp. v. Araneta Center, Inc.
,
[133]
 and 
Tondo Medical Center v. Rante
.
[134]
 The Court, in these cases, saw it fit to exemplify the breadth of what may constitute grave abuse of discretion with the enumeration of scenarios carried over from Section 24 of R.A. 876, in order to fine-tune the operative examples of grave abuse in the context of the CIAC arbitral tribunals. This is further consistent with the caution of the Court in 
HiÂ­-Precision
 when it warned that "x x x [a]ny other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration x x x." 
[135]
 The Court's consistent pronouncement in the above cases only reinforce its attitude towards CIAC arbitral awards, 
i.e
., that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal are final unless the integrity of said tribunal or the constitutionality or legality of its actions are put in question. 
 Told differently, the limited instances which parties may cite as impetus for a judicial factual review of a CIAC award pertain to integrity-centered or Constitution or law-anchored flaws which, in turn, translate to grave abuses of discretion that are within the ambit of a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65. The correspondence is made clear given the very nature of a Rule 65 petition, and the metes and bounds of the issues it is designed to resolve. Demonstrably, in the case of 
Tagle v. Equitable PCI Bank
,
[136]
 the Court spoke plainly: 
 
 A special civil action for 
Certiorari
, or simply a Petition for 
Certiorari
, under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court is intended for the correction of errors of jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Its principal office is only to keep the inferior court within the parameters of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. 
 
 A writ of 
certiorari
 may be issued only for the correction of errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Such cannot be used for any other purpose, as its function is limited to keeping the inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction. 
 
 For a petition for 
certiorari
 to prosper, the essential requisites that have to concur are: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. 
 
 The phrase "
without jurisdiction
" means that the court acted with absolute lack of authority or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority. "
Excess of jurisdiction
" occurs when the court transcends its power or acts without any statutory authority; or results when an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, board or officer (to do) is not authorized, and invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of the general power in respect of it are wanting. While that of "
grave abuse of discretion
" implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as to be equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction; simply put, power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility; and such exercise is so patent or so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal either to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.
[137]
 
 
 Further, the resort to a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 is confined to assailing the integrity of the arbitral tribunal based on any of the aforementioned factual scenarios (
e.g
., corruption, fraud, evident partiality of the tribunal), or the constitutionality or legality of the conduct of the arbitration process, and may not remain unqualified as to embrace other badges of grave abuse. The design and intent of the relevant laws on judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards do not empower the CA to look into the factual findings of the CIAC apart from the foregoing circumscribed grounds, lest the authoritative and conclusive factual findings of the CIAC be nevertheless defeated, albeit 
via
 a petition other than Rule 43. 
 This operative limiting of the grounds under Rule 65 with respect to judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards remains consistent with the Court's constitutionally granted authority, owing chiefly to the conceptually dynamic nature of grave abuse of discretion. To be sure, the Constitution provided the Court's power to take cognizance of petitions alleging grave abuse of discretion, with the second paragraph of Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution particularly stating: 
 
 
Section 1.
 The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.
 
 
Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 However, far from being static, the very contours of what constitutes grave abuse of discretion have always been traced by the Court in a judicious but fragmentary manner, as called for by each case in jurisprudence. Distinctively, therefore, although the remedy of petition for 
certiorari
, as the procedural vehicle, is purposefully rigid and unyielding in order to avoid overextension of the same over situations that do not raise an error of jurisdiction, the concept of grave abuse of discretion which must be alleged to avail of the 
certiorari
 remedy is, in the same degree, deliberately flexible, in order to enable it to capture a whole spectrum of permutations of grave abuse. If the case were otherwise, 
i.e
., if the concept of grave abuse were rigid, and the 
certiorari
 remedy loose, the same would be exposed to the possibility of having a clear act of whim and caprice placed beyond the ambit of the court's 
certiorari
 power because of a definitional discomfiture in the legal procedure. 
 On point is the case of 
Oposa v. Factoran, Jr
.,
[138]
 where the Court, citing Justice Isagani A. Cruz, described the dynamic property of the concept of grave abuse in the context of the expanded judicial review power, and succinctly described it thus: 
 
 As worded, the new provision vests in the judiciary, and particularly the Supreme Court, the power to rule upon even the wisdom of the decisions of the executive and the legislature and to declare their acts invalid for lack or excess of jurisdiction because tainted with grave abuse of discretion. 
The catch, of course, is the meaning of 'grave abuse of discretion,' which is a 
very elastic phrase
 that can expand or contract 
according to the disposition of the judiciary
.
[139]
 
 
 The elasticity of the Court's use of its power of judicial review under the 'grave abuse of discretion' standard has also been suggested as that which significantly depends on a variety of considerations, even including the "rationality, predispositions, and value judgments"
[140]
 of the Court's members. This conceptual malleability of 'grave abuse of discretion' allows it to stretch as it needs to cover vast permutations of grave abuse, but also contracts, as the Court here deems it fit, so as not to negate categorical legislative intent as provided for by E.O. 1008.
 In point of fact, grave abuse as a ground for judicial review covers a multitude of scenarios, with each operative definition colored with caprice or whim, but fleshed out in a variety of commissions, and embraces not only those which betray a possible challenge on the integrity of an arbitral tribunal. 
 Early jurisprudence has laid down a broad construction of what constitutes grave abuse of discretion. In the 1939 case of 
Santos v. Province of Tarlac
,
[141]
 the concept of abuse of discretion was construed as that which contemplates such a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. This was later echoed in the 1941 case of 
Alafriz v. Nable
,
[142]
 where the Court defined grave abuse as that where the court has acted "x x x with absolute want of jurisdiction x x x"
[143]
 or where the court has transcended its jurisdiction or "x x x acted without any statutory authority x x x".
[144]
 
 In the 1960 case of 
Hamoy v. Hon. Sec. of Agriculture and Natural Resources, et al
.,
[145]
 the Court added that the abuse of discretion must be shown to be attended by "x x x passion, prejudice, or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of positive duty x x x."
[146]
 Still, in 1966, in the case of 
Palma and Ignacio v. Q. & S. Inc., et al
.,
[147]
 the Court further qualified abuse of discretion and added that an error of judgment is not abuse of discretion, as the same must be colored with despotism or whim, 
viz
.: 
 
 x x x [A]n abuse of discretion is not sufficient by itself to justify the issuance of a writ of [
certiorari
]. x x x [T]he abuse must be grave and patent, and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily or despotically x x x.
[148]
 
 
 In 1979, in 
Dimayacyac v. Court of Appeals
,
[149]
 the trial court therein was found to have committed grave abuse of discretion for declaring a party before in default and rendering judgment against them hurriedly, for mere failure of the party in default to file a pre-trial brief. In the case of 
Producers Bank of the Phils. v. NLRC
,
[150]
 grave abuse of discretion was construed as such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment that is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction and involves power that is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility. Grave abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all m contemplation of law. 
 To note, in the 1999 case of 
Nepomuceno v. Court of Appeals
,
[151]
 the Court ruled that "grave abuse of discretion is indeed a relative term"
[152]
 and admits of exceptions in the interest of substantial justice. 
 Recent jurisprudential iterations have further maintained this construction of grave abuse of discretion. In the case of 
DueÃ±as, Jr. v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal
,
[153]
 grave abuse of discretion was defined as the capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, or the exercise of power in an arbitrary manner, where the abuse is so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty.
[154]
 In 
Cruz v. People
,
[155]
 manifest disregard of basic rules and procedures constituted grave abuse of discretion. In 
Comilang v. Belen
,
[156]
 a showing of manifest bias and partiality likewise amounted to grave abuse. 
Neri v. Yu
,
[157]
 also defined grave abuse as that which includes not only palpable errors of jurisdiction or violations of the Constitution, the law, and jurisprudence, but also includes gross misapprehension of facts. 
 Indicatively, going by the jurisprudential construction of grave abuse of discretion as contemplated by Rule 65, the same decidedly casts a wider net than that which is consistent with the narrower confines of factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, and covers numerous other scenarios apart from that which may amount to a challenge of the integrity of a tribunal. The above cases demonstrate badges of grave abuse that could not have been contemplated as far as factual review of CIAC awards is concerned. To leave this Rule 65 resort unqualified is, therefore, to leave it overinclusive, at the expense of the weight and conclusiveness of findings of fact of the CIAC. Stated differently, precisely because challenging the integrity, constitutionality or legality of the tribunal or its actions in the arbitral process are only some of the many permutations of grave abuse within the construction of Rule 65, the delimitation is crucial for purposes of factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, if a resort to a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 is to be made consistent with E.O. 1008. 
 By extension, if the petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 route for review of CIAC arbitral awards remains as indiscriminate as the scope of Rule 65 as it is more generally applied, it would entertain grounds for factual review that E.O. 1008 and other relevant rules intended to keep out. 
 The Court herein emphasizes that the qualification and contraction of the concept of grave abuse of discretion under Rule 65 with respect to a CIAC arbitral award calibrates, instead of confuses, the grounds for a Rule 65 petition. It is a contraction that is imperative if remedial law is to promote, and not frustrate, the unique configuration of the CIAC, and enable it to unfold as designed within the structure of the present remedial rules. It does not proceed from the presumption that said contraction is being made in order to address what may experientially be seen as a loose treatment of the 
certiorari 
action in practice. On the contrary, the contraction is being made not because the 
certiorari
 power is being indiscriminately employed, but because in itself, even with its rigid application, said 
certiorari
 power is still not narrow enough given the framework that the persuasive authority of CIAC awards must be ascribed primacy. 
 The Court also holds with particular import that there is nothing procedurally problematic or constitutionally abhorrent in distilling the prototypical grounds under Section 24 of R.A. 876 as reflective of the very grounds which show a grave abuse of discretion in relation to CIAC arbitral awards. There is nothing precarious in the Court's acknowledgment that the concept of grave abuse is elastic enough to lend itself to the Court's calibration depending on the context within which it is to be appreciated. 
 Contrary to the caution offered that the concept of grave abuse of discretion is tantamount to judicial legislation, the Court here discerns that its appropriation of the prototypical grounds as provided under Section 24 of R.A. 876 into the judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards, as well as its appreciation of the nuanced expressions of grave abuse of discretion in this specific context squarely fall within the rule-making power of the Court. The authority is rooted in Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution, and the impetus therefor described as thus: 
 
 x x x This deliberate expansion of both judicial review and rule-making powers of the Philippine Supreme Court typifies the active re-direction of the Court's role, away from the passivity under the standard political question doctrine that had predominated earlier constitutional eras under the 1973 and 1935 Constitutions. 
 
 x x x x
 
 When the 1986 EDSA "People Power" Revolution successfully ousted Marcos, one of the first acts of the new government under Corazon Aquino (and facilitated by now Constitutional Commissioner Roberto Concepcion) was to strengthen the independence and judicial review powers of the Philippine Supreme Court. Under the 1987 Constitution, the Philippine Supreme Court was intentionally entrusted with broader judicial review and rule-making powers. The framers of the 1987 Constitution envisioned that the Court as the institution most critical to safeguarding democracy in the Philippines' post-dictatorship constitutional order. Wary of the Court's reputational decline in 
Javellana
, the Philippine Supreme Court under the 1987 Constitutional reiterated fidelity to the Constitution as the foremost mandate of judicial conduct: "Justices and judges must ever realize that they have no constituency, serve no majority nor minority but serve only the public interest as they see it in accordance with their oath of office, guided only by the Constitution and their own conscience and honour."
[158]
 
 
 
 Markedly, as the Court has held in 
Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice
[159]
 and 
Estipona, Jr. v. Lobrigo
,
[160]
 the independent rule-making power of the Court is a reaction to the prevenient disposition of the Court that consigns it to sidestep matters of inequity or injustice in the court proceedings because of its lack of power to procedurally address them. The Court therefore holds that this is not a dangerous precedent but a mere exercise of extant rule-making and 
certiorari
 powers of the Court. This authority also since pivoted the Court away from the previous institutional attitude of avoidance. 
 More, the exercise of contracting grave abuse of discretion in order to correct what has been shown to be a procedural confoundment in the instant case is not new either in the Court's jurisprudential history or its immediate horizon. Perhaps, there will be future inadequacies in procedure that the Court will be moved to remedy, and that the same will require its reconciliation or harmonization with substantive laws. The reinforced rule-making power of the Court straightforwardly allows it to undertake the same, as it now does. 
 As is apparent in the two grounds that trigger the exceptional factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, 
i.e.
, those that pertain to either the lack of integrity or the imputed unconstitutionality or illegality of the arbitrators or the arbitral process, the contracted grounds are tight enough, but nevertheless embrace and preserve the courts' power to re-examine factual findings of a CIAC arbitral tribunal, precisely when the latter's lack of integrity, or its unconstitutional or illegal actions taint the same. Most assuredly, the power of the courts to uphold the Constitution and preserve observance of positive law are woven into the very fabric of the judicial system, and remain undiminished in the Court's present interpretation of the available remedial routes from CIAC arbitral awards. 
 Therefore, in the instant case and for purposes of judicial review of the CIAC arbitral awards, this Court now divines Rule 65, being confined to challenges only to the arbitral tribunal's integrity or allegations of its actions' unconstitutionality or illegality, to be a warranted contraction of the breadth of the concept of 'grave abuse of discretion', in order to harmonize a Rule 65 resort with the unequivocal intent of E.O. 1008, and other relevant laws, including R.A. 876 and R.A. 9285, which apply supplementarily. To be sure, although E.O. 1008 applies specifically to the CIAC as a specialized arbitral institution for the construction industry, nothing precludes the Court from applying the umbrella legislation of R.A. 876 and its significant amendment, R.A. 9285. 
 Undoubtedly, R.A. 876, R.A. 9285 and E.O. 1008, while distinct, are conceptually and operatively related in the sphere of arbitration law. For one, R.A. 9285 expressly references E.O. 1008 as the rules of procedure that apply to construction disputes. The whole of its Chapter 6 pertains to arbitration of construction disputes where, substantively: (1) Section 17(d)
[161]
 thereof provides its application to mediated construction disputes, (2) Sections 28
[162]
 and 29 
[163]
 thereof outline the availability of interim measures of protection in construction arbitration, (3) Section 35
[164]
 thereof enumerates the kinds of disputes that fall within the purview of the CIAC's jurisdiction, and (4) Section 39
[165]
 thereof relatedly authorizes the regional trial courts to dismiss a construction dispute before it, if the same involves an arbitration clause that was not previously resorted to. 
 As well, the Special ADR Rules further categorically refer to R.A. 876 when it laid down the grounds for which, as a general rule, the court may vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal. Specifically, Rule 19.10 of the same provides: 
 
 
RULE 19.10. 
Rule on judicial review on arbitration in the Philippines.
 - As a general rule, the court can only vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal upon a clear showing that the award suffers from any of the infirmities or grounds for vacating an arbitral award under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876 or under Rule 34 of the Model Law
 in a domestic arbitration, or for setting aside an award in an international arbitration under Article 34 of the Model Law, or for such other grounds provided under these Special Rules.
 
 If the Regional Trial Court is asked to set aside an arbitral award in a domestic or international arbitration on any ground other than those provided in the Special ADR Rules, the court shall entertain such ground for the setting aside or non-recognition of the arbitral award only if the same amounts to a violation of public policy. 
 
 The court shall not set aside or vacate the award of the arbitral tribunal merely on the ground that the arbitral tribunal committed errors of fact, or of law, or of fact and law, as the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the arbitral tribunal. (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 Still, illustratively, in the case of 
LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups Inc.
,
[166] 
the Court found no impediment in applying R.A. 876 in a suppletory nature to an otherwise purely CIAC-governed dispute, in order to stay the court proceedings where the dispute was found to be arbitrable before the CIAC: 
 
 The arbitral clause in the Agreement is a commitment on the part of the parties to submit to arbitration the disputes covered therein. Because that clause is binding, they are expected to abide by it in good faith. And because it covers the dispute between the parties in the present case, either of them may compel the other to arbitrate. 
 
 Since petitioner has already filed a Complaint with the RTC without prior recourse to arbitration, the proper procedure to enable the CIAC to decide on the dispute is to request the stay or suspension of such action, as provided under [R.A.] 876 [the Arbitration Law].
[167]
 
 
 To note, although Section 24 of R.A. 876 has not been transplanted verbatim into the CIAC Rules, the logic behind its adaption into the judicial review of the arbitral awards remains unrefuted. It likewise remains to be negated the fact that the Court has already jurisprudentially appropriated Section 24 of R.A. 876 as the very same situations that may justify the Court's examination of CIAC arbitral award's findings of fact. 
 Furthermore, and assuredly, the resort to the courts was legislatively designed to succeed other remedies that disputants before the CIAC may avail themselves of in case of errors in an arbitral tribunal's award that merit its modification. The current CIAC Rules provide a remedy that allows the parties to winnow through their arbitral award and effect the correction of gross errors such as mathematical miscalculations and the like. The more general R.A. 876, particularly, Section 25 thereof provides: 
 
 
Section 25. 
Grounds for modifying or correcting award. - In any one of the following cases, the court must make an order modifying or correcting the award, upon the application of any party to the controversy which was arbitrated: 
 
 
 (a) Where there was an 
evident miscalculation of figures, or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred
 to in the award; or
 
 (b) Where the arbitrators have 
awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, 
not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted
; or
 
 (c) Where the 
award is imperfect in a matter of form 
not affecting the merits of the controversy
, and if it had been a commissioner's report, the defect could have been amended or disregarded by the court. 
 
 
 The order may modify and correct the award so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 
 
 
 This enumeration of grounds for correction of errors in arbitral awards was adopted and echoed in the CIAC Rules,
[168]
 specifically Section 17 thereof: 
 
 
SECTION 17.1 Motion for correction of final award
 - Any of the parties may file a motion for correction of the Final award within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof upon any of the following grounds: 
 
 
 
 
a.
 
an evident miscalculation of figures, a typographical or arithmetical error;
 
 
 
b.
 
 
an evident mistake in the description of any party, person, date, amount, thing or property referred to in the award.
 
 
 
c.
 
where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, 
not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted
;
 
 
 
d.
 
where the arbitrators have failed or omitted to resolve certain issue/s formulated by the parties in the Terms of Reference (TOR) and submitted to them for resolution; and
 
 
 
e.
 
where the award is 
imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy
.
 
 
 
 
The motion shall be acted upon by the Arbitral Tribunal or the surviving/remaining members. 
 
 
 
17.1.1
 The filing of the motion for correction shall interrupt the running of the period for appeal. 
 
 
17.1.2
 A motion for correction upon grounds other than those mentioned in this section shall not interrupt the running of the period for appeal. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 
 
 
 
 Crucially, however, the above grounds that merit a modification or correction of an arbitral award, whether in the earlier provisions under R.A. 876 or in the recent iterations under the CIAC Rules, importantly: (1) do not pertain to any allegation of fraud, corruption, or grave abuse; and (2) pertain only to honest mistakes, miscalculations of figures, and do not affect the arbitral tribunal's findings with respect to the very merit of the dispute. 
 Evidently therefore, the intent of the relevant laws with respect to the treatment of arbitral awards is two-tiered: first, that they are final as far as their appreciation of the facts that go into the merit of the dispute is concerned; and second, in case of obvious errors of facts (
e.g.,
 miscalculations), they are modifiable or correctible only insofar as they do not affect the merits of the controversy. Such is the restrained attitude that courts were intended to maintain with respect to arbitral awards. Such purposively narrow windows for changing the arbitral tribunal's award are most in consonance with the confined posture towards appeals as unambiguously provided for by E.O. 1008, and as fleshed out by R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules. 
 For more than preserving expediency and convenience, this restrained attitude against challenging arbitral awards on their merits most importantly respects party-autonomy, which is the essence of arbitration
[169]
 and the pro-arbitration State policy of the country. So that when the courts deem a CIAC arbitral award as final, barring exceptions, the courts are really upholding the substantive rights of the disputing parties and their exercise of autonomy in deciding in what manner, for how long, and before which forum their dispute is to be resolved. This is but the Court's recognition that party-autonomy underpins the very option of disputing parties to refer their construction dispute before the CIAC, and that the same has been central in the legislative intendment of a more limited and restricted mode of judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the Court now holds that the judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards takes either of two remedial routes, depending on the issue being raised. 
First
, if the issue raised is a pure question of law, the petition should be filed directly and exclusively with the Court, notwithstanding Rule 43. 
Second
, in cases where the petition takes issue on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal and its decision, (
i.e
., allegations of corruption, fraud, misconduct, evident partiality, incapacity or excess of powers within the tribunal), or the unconstitutionality or invalidity of its actions in the arbitral process
[170]
 then the parties can and should appeal the CIAC award before the CA under Rule 65, on grounds of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction, where a factual review may then be had by the CA. 
 Concomitantly, the availability of a resort to the CA 
via
 a Rule 65 petition under these circumstances must also necessarily amend Rule 19.7 of the Special ADR Rules which proscribes any filing of a special civil action of a petition for 
certiorari
. This necessary amendment will allow for the narrowest of grounds for a factual review of a CIAC arbitral award to be brought before the proper court through the correct action. This amendment is also merited so that the Special ADR Rules may not, without their intention, frustrate instead of facilitate the modes of appeal from CIAC arbitral awards. 
 This harmonization is most consistent with the spirit of the law which created the CIAC, as was reaffirmed by R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules. Accordingly, all rules and regulations that allow the contrary, including the pertinent provisions in the Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, Rule 43 of the Rules and the CIAC Rules, should be deemed amended to conform to the rule on direct resort to this Court on pure questions of law. As well, all the previous cases of 
Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation
[171]
 and the more recent case of 
Shangri-La Properties, Inc. v. B.F. Corporation
[172]
 are now deemed abandoned. 
 Be that as it may, the Court nevertheless clarifies that this instant carving out of the CIAC from the enumeration under Rule 43, along with the effective reversal of jurisprudence that provide otherwise, is 
prospective
 in application, as judicial decisions applying or interpreting laws form part of the legal system of the Philippines until they are reversed, and remain good law until abandoned.
[173]
 The prospective application of the present ruling on the proper modes of appeal from a CIAC arbitral award applies in favor of parties who have relied on the old doctrine and have acted in good faith.
[174]
 As the Court elaborated in 
Benzonan v. Court of Appeals
:
[175]
 
 
 x x x [P]ursuant to Article 8 of the Civil Code "judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines." But while our decisions form part of the law of the land, they are also subject to Article 4 of the Civil Code which provides that "laws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided." This is expressed in the familiar legal maxim 
lex prospicit, non respicit
, the law looks forward not backward. The rationale against retroactivity is easy to perceive. The retroactive application of a law usually divests rights that have already become vested or impairs the obligations of contract and hence, is unconstitutional.
[176]
 
 
 
 The Court hereby sets the following guidelines with respect to the application of the present ruling on modes of judicial review
 vis-Ã -vis 
CIAC arbitral awards: 
 
 
 
1.
 
For appeals from CIAC arbitral awards that have already been filed and are currently pending before the CA under Rule 43, the prior availability of the appeal on matters of fact and law thereon applies. This is only proper since the parties resorted to this mode of review as it was the existing procedural rules at the time of filing, prior to the instant amendment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.
 
For future appeals from CIAC arbitral awards that will be filed after the promulgation of this Decision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a.
 
If the issue to be raised by the parties is a pure question of law, the appeal should be filed directly and exclusively with the Court through a petition for review under Rule 45.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b.
 
 
If the parties will appeal factual issues, the appeal may be filed with the CA, but only on the limited grounds that pertain to either a challenge on the integrity of the CIAC arbitral tribunal (
i.e.
, allegations of corruption, fraud, misconduct, evident partiality, incapacity or excess of powers within the tribunal) or an allegation that the arbitral tribunal violated the Constitution or positive law in the conduct of the arbitral process, through the special civil action of a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65, on grounds of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction. The CA may conduct a factual review only upon sufficient and demonstrable showing that the integrity of the CIAC arbitral tribunal had indeed been compromised, or that it committed unconstitutional or illegal acts in the conduct of the arbitration.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.
 
 
Under no other circumstances other than the limited grounds provided above may parties appeal to the CA a CIAC arbitral award. 
 
 
 
 
III - Judicial Review of the CIAC award in the case at bar
 
 With the terrain on the mode of appeal from CIAC awards defined for bright-line prospective application, this Court finally proceeds to the merit of the parties, as seen from the lens of this limited scope of judicial review. 
 The narrow exception to the general deference to the expert findings and conclusions of the CIAC attends the present consolidated petitions, as the petition presents a pure question of law on which the construction dispute turns, 
i.e
., the nature and legal effect of a withholding agent's belated withholding and remitting of the 2% CWT. 
 Further, even without applying to the instant case the foregoing considerations on the history of judicial review 
vis-Ã -vis
 CIAC awards, the Court nevertheless chiefly observes that the CA misapplied its appellate function when it delved into settling the factual matters and modified the mathematical computation of the CIAC with respect to the presence or absence of an outstanding balance payable to RSII. This mathematical re-computation is an error not because the new ruling on judicial review of CIAC awards is applicable to this case (as it applies prospectively) but because the amounts reimbursable to RSII were not specifically raised by the RSII as an issue in its Rule 43 petition before the CA, since the issues raised before it were confined to the release of the amount deducted by GMCLI from its Progress Billing No. 15 to cover the CWT of 2% on payments for the first 14 Progress Billings.
[177]
 In addition, that the CA made a precipitate factual conclusion of the correctness of RSII's mathematical computation over that of GMCLI after citing gossamer-thin basis perhaps betrays the general impropriety of an appellate court's review of factual findings of more specialized tribunals and quasi-judicial agencies, which were legally ascribed primacy. 
 As has been said, the referral of construction disputes to the CIAC is grounded on the need for construction efforts to, as far as possible, remain unfettered by lengthy and belabored court cases, and for parties in the construction industry to be given enough breathing room to maneuver the same for the farsighted benefit of national development. 
 Disputes such as the one presented by the petitions at bar, which to date already ran a lifespan of over four years, illustrate the need for CIAC arbitral awards to henceforth be given the authoritative sway and deference that they merit, as well as demonstrates the call for courts to stay their hands until a pure question of law can be distilled from the dispute and brought before it. 
 
The CWT Issue
 Secondly, with regard to the tax issue, and without leaving RSII deprived of any remedy under the law, the Court finds that the CIAC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly found GMCLI to be without the authority to belatedly withhold the 2% withholding tax, but that despite the lack of authority of GMCLI to belatedly withhold and remit the 2% CWT, RSII is nevertheless still not entitled to the release of the amount equivalent to that withheld in the cumulative. 
 The axis of the present dispute, as well as the remaining remedy herein, lies in the definition and design of the CWT. The Expanded CWT, as defined under Section 2.57(B) of Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 2-98
[178]
 reads: 
 
 (B) 
Creditable Withholding Tax
. - Under the CWT system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are intended to equal or at least approximate the tax due of the payee on said income. The income recipient is still required to file an income tax return, as prescribed in Sec. 51 and Sec. 52 of the NIRC, as amended, to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income. Taxes withheld on income payments covered by the expanded withholding tax (referred to in Sec. 2.57.2 of these regulations) and compensation income (referred to in Sec. 2.78 also of these regulations) are creditable in nature. 
 
 
 Among the classifications of withholding taxes, the CWT is a tax imposed on certain income payments and is creditable against the income tax due of the payee for the taxable quarter/year in which the particular income was earned.
[179]
 Essentially, the CWT is an advance income tax on the payee. Prior to the actual filing of income tax return, the taxpayer already pays a portion of its foreseeable income tax liability in the form of the creditable income tax, withheld and remitted for him on his behalf by the withholding agent. 
 Upon the filing of the payee's income tax return, the income of the payee which was subject to the CWT is still reported in the income tax return, for the computation of the income tax due on it. In the event that the income tax computed is more than the CWT paid earlier, the difference shall be paid by the payee in order for his income tax to be paid in full. Conversely, in case the income tax calculated is less than the CWT paid, the overpayment of CWT shall either be carried over to the next taxable period for the payee, or refunded in his favor. 
 RR No. 2-98, Section 2.57.3, further recites the persons required to be withholding agents, under which GMCLI falls to wit: 
 
 SECTION 2.57.3. 
Persons Required to Deduct and Withhold
 - The following persons are hereby constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld on income payments enumerated in Section 2.57.2: 
 
 
 (A) In general, any judicial person, whether or not engaged in trade or business: 
 
 x x x x
 
 
 
Agents, employees or any person purchasing goods or services, paying for and in behalf of the aforesaid withholding agents shall likewise withhold in their behalf
, provided that the official receipts of payments/sales invoice shall be issued in the name of the person whom the former represents and the 
corresponding certificates of taxes withheld (BIR Form No. 2307) shall immediately be issued upon withholding of the tax.
 
 
 x x x x.
[180]
 (Emphasis supplied; underscoring omitted) 
 
 
 Finally, the same RR likewise appoints the time when the 2% CWT should be withheld, under Section 2.57.4 thereof: 
 
SECTION 2.57.4. 
Time of Withholding
 - The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax under Section 2.57 of the Regulations arises at the time an income payment is paid or payable, or the income payment is accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable, in the payor's books, whichever comes first. The terms [sic] "payable" refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable. 
 
 
 The CWT's design, therefore, for tax creditability, stands on the twin conditions of the withholding agent's withholding the CWT, on the one hand, and the payee's crediting of said amount in its income tax return, on the other. 
 The black letter of the law is demonstrably clear and, as applied to the present case, prescribes that GMCLI should have remitted the 2% CWT as soon as each Progress Billing was paid and accordingly should have also issued the corresponding BIR Fonn 2307 to RSII in order for the latter to have had a tax credit claim on the same. GMCLI should therefore issue to RSII the pertinent BIR Form 2307 for all its belated withholding of CWT, so that RSII may exhaust the remedies available to it in the law. 
 It also warrants mentioning that withholding agents who delay the withholding and remittance of the CWT, are liable to pay the 25% surcharge in accordance with Section 248
[181]
 of the National Revenue Code of 1997 (NIRC), 12% interest rate in accordance with R.A. 10963
[182]
 or the TRAIN Law, and the compromise penalty of not less than P40,000.00, in compliance with Section 255
[183]
 of the NIRC, and more specifically Annex A
[184]
 of the Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 7-2015.
 Finally, this dispute over the construction of a hospital has already been pending for over four years, which in the construction industry exponentially translates to increasingly damaging delay, all the more necessitating resolution at the soonest possible time.
 
Conclusion
 It has been said that earlier forms of arbitration predated laws and organized courts,
[185]
 and that contrary to the notion that arbitration modes are novel and untested, they are actually the courts' "next-of-kin",
[186]
 perhaps even their progenitors. Along the same vein, the ability of a society to empower alternative modes of dispute resolution is a hallmark of a democracy,
[187]
 with courts exercising their ability to stay their own hands, thereby allowing space for the parties to a dispute to exercise their voluntary autonomy in the name and under the principle of expedited conflict resolutions. This need to enable the quickest and most conclusive conflict resolution possible finds exacting relevance in the case of the construction industry, with its inherently complex dynamics, and with the stakes that involve national interests, not in the least of which are public infrastructure and safety.
 The attributes and functions of the CIAC also operatively place it in a hybrid classification, in that it is categorized as a quasi-judicial agency, but its very nature as an arbitral tribunal effectively places it at par with other commercial arbitral tribunals, with their characteristic speed, subject matter authoritativeness and overall autonomy. This amalgamation of its design and utilities created a whole new legal animal, which, like all things novel, poses for the Court a challenge of ascertaining its parameters and remedial routes set by law. Perhaps, unless the legislature deems it fit to create a new and independent set of rules that apply to the CIAC more responsively, the Court must continue to contend with harmonizing varying material rules, all m a manner that is as just as it is tenable under existing laws. 
 It is central, therefore, that the CIAC be empowered and enabled to fulfill its function as the professionally authoritative venue for settlement of construction disputes, and not straitjacketed to fit into the mold of the court system which it was meant to be an alternative of. To this end, and perhaps somewhat ironically, the courts can contribute best through non-participation, save on the narrowest of grounds. The courts are, after all, ultimately dealers of justice, more so in industries that are of greater consequence, and must remain true to this highest mandate, even if it means relinquishing review powers that, in the sum of things, it was demonstrably not meant to bear. 
 Further, the Court in this wise irretrievably unravels the previous hesitation to completely remove CIAC awards from the purview of Rule 43 appeals. A clear historical affirmation of their exclusion begs no other consequence, and the Court would be remiss if it insists on maintaining the existing procedural route after the same has been shown to be not only substantively counterintuitive but more so unfounded. 
 As has been fleshed out by the present controversy, this overarching attempt towards less court litigation and more of alternative conflict resolution in the construction industry must only get support from the Court through its own restraint, lest it be accused of being eager towards copious and lengthy litigations, or worse, indifferent to their costs.

 A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact. Id. at 317.

[74]
 G.R. No. 200401, January 17, 2018, 851 SCRA 378. The Court here held: 
 
 While Rule 43 petitions may pertain to questions of fact questions of law, or both questions of law and fact, it has been established that factual findings of CIAC may not be reviewed on appeal. In 
CE Construction v. Araneta
, this Court explained that appeals from CIAC may only raise questions of law:
 
 
 This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: that there were those that enabled questions of fact, there were those that enabled questions of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law. Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals. However, in keeping with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any appeal from CIAC Arbitral Tribunals must remain limited to questions of law. Id. at 404.

 G.R. No. 198849, August 7, 2019, accessed at <

 This dispute is better left to the expertise of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, a quasi-judicial body with the technical expertise to resolve disputes outside the expertise of regular courts. Aptly, it should adjudicate and determine the claims and rights of petitioner and respondent with respect to the construction contract and all its incidents.
 
 
 
[76]
 G.R. No. 202430, March 6, 2019, 895 SCRA 217. Here the Court reasoned: 
 
 On the other hand, arbitral awards by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission may only be appealed on pure questions of law, though not all will justify an appeal. Consistent with the strict standards for judicial review of arbitral awards, only those appeals which involve egregious errors of law may be entertained.
 
 Given its technical expertise, the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission is given a wide latitude of discretion so that it may resolve all issues before it in a fair and expeditious manner x x x. Id. at 223-224.

[87]
 Pursuant thereto, RULES OF COURT, Rule 45, Sec. 1 echoes: 
 
 
SECTION 1.
 
Filing of petition with Supreme Court
. â A party desiring to appeal by 
certiorari
 from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. (1a, 2a).
 
 
 Notably, the text of Rule 45, Section 1 of the present Rules of Court was different with Rule 45, Section 1 of the 1964 Rules of Court, which only referred to an appeal by 
certiorari
 from a final judgment of the Court of Appeals. As such, Rule 45 Section 1 of the 1964 Rules of Court had to be adopted in statutes creating and providing for appeals from certain administrative or quasi-judicial agencies, whenever the purpose was to restrict the scope of the appeal to questions of law. Fabian observed that while the intended limitation on appellate review was not fully subserved by recourse to the former Rule 45, at that time, there was no uniform rule on appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. This was exactly the case with the creation of CIAC by virtue of E.O. 1008, which was enacted on February 4, 1985. Hence, Sec. 19 thereof on Finality of Awards provided that the arbitral award shall be final and unappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court.

A motion for reconsideration of any order, directive or decision of the Office of the Ombudsman must be filed within five (5) days after receipt of written notice and shall be entertained only on any of the following grounds:
x x x x
 Findings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman when supported by substantial evidence are conclusive. Any order, directive or decision imposing the penalty of public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month salary shall be final and unappealable.
 In all administrative disciplinary cases, orders, directives or decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman may be appealed to the Supreme Court by filing a petition for certiorari within ten (10) days from receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision or denial of the motion for reconsideration in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
 The above rules may be amended or modified by the Office of the Ombudsman as the interest of justice may require.

 As aptly explained by Chief Justice Gesmundo during the deliberations. 
 
[129]
 Section 24 thereof provides: 
 
 Section 24. Grounds for vacating award. - In any one of the following cases, the court must make an order vacating the award upon the petition of any party to the controversy when such party proves affirmatively that in the arbitration proceedings:
 
 (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or
 (b) That there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or
 (c) That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; that one or more of the arbitrators was disqualified to act as such under section nine hereof, and wilfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or
 (d) That the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.
 
 Where an award is vacated, the court, in its discretion, may direct a new hearing either before the same arbitrators or before a new arbitrator or arbitrators to be chosen in the manner provided in the submission or contract for the selection of the original arbitrator or arbitrators, and any provision limiting the time in which the arbitrators may make a decision shall be deemed applicable to the new arbitration and to commence from the date of the court's order.
 
 Where the court vacates an award, costs, not exceeding fifty pesos and disbursements may be awarded to the prevailing party and the payment thereof may be enforced in like manner as the payment of costs upon the motion in an action.

 R.A. 9285, Sec. 17 provides: 
 
SEC. 17. Enforcement of Mediated Settlement Agreements.
 - The mediation shall be guided by the following operative principles: 
 
 (a) A settlement agreement following successful mediation shall be prepared by the parties with the assistance of their respective counsel, if any, and by the mediator. The parties and their respective counsels shall endeavor to make the terms and condition thereof complete and make adequate provisions for the contingency of breach to avoid conflicting interpretations of the agreement.
 (b) The parties and their respective counsels, if any, shall sign the settlement agreement. The mediator shall certify that he/she explained the contents of the settlement agreement to the parties in a language known to them.
 (c) If the parties so desire, they may deposit such settlement agreement with the appropriate Clerk of a Regional Trial Court of the place where one of the parties resides. Where there is a need to enforce the settlement agreement, a petition may be filed by any of the parties with the same court, in which case, the court shall proceed summarily to hear the petition, in accordance with such rules of procedure as may be promulgated by the Supreme Court.
 
(d) The parties may agree in the settlement agreement that the mediator shall become a sole arbitrator for the dispute and shall treat the settlement agreement as an arbitral award which shall be subject to enforcement under Republic Act. No. 876, otherwise known as the Arbitration Law, notwithstanding the provisions of Executive Order No. 1008 for mediated disputes outside of the CIAC.

 Id., Sec. 28 provides: 
 
SEC. 28. Grant of Interim Measure of Protection.
 - (a) It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request, before constitution of the tribunal, from a Court an interim measure of protection and for the Court to grant such measure. After constitution of the arbitral tribunal and during arbitral proceedings, a request for an interim measure of protection, or modification thereof, may be made with the arbitral tribunal or to the extent that the arbitral tribunal has no power to act or is unable to act effectively, the request may be made with the Court. The arbitral tribunal is deemed constituted when the sole arbitrator or the third arbitrator, who has been nominated, has accepted the nomination and written communication of said nomination and acceptance has been received by the party making the request. 
 
 The following rules on interim or provisional relief shall be observed: 
 
(1) Any party may request that provisional relief be granted against the adverse party. 
 (2) Such relief may be granted:
 
 
 (i) to prevent irreparable loss or injury;
 (ii) to provide security for the performance of any obligation;
 (iii) to produce or preserve any evidence; or 
 (iv) to compel any other appropriate act or omission.
 
 
 (3) The order granting provisional relief may be conditioned upon the provision of security or any act or omission specified in the order.
 (4) Interim or provisional relief is requested by written application transmitted by reasonable means to the Court or arbitral tribunal as the case may be and the party against whom the relief is sought, describing in appropriate detail the precise relief, the party against whom the relief is requested, the grounds for the relief, and the evidence supporting the request. 
 (5) The order shall be binding upon the parties. 
 (6) Either party may apply with the Court for assistance in implementing or enforcing an interim measure ordered by an arbitral tribunal.
 (7) A party who does not comply with the order shall be liable for all damages resulting from noncompliance, including all expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, paid in obtaining the order's judicial enforcement.
 
 
 
[163]
 Id. Sec. 29 states: 
 
 
 SEC. 29. Further Authority for Arbitrator to Grant
 
Interim Measure of Protection.
 - Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order any party to take such interim measures of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute following the rules in Section 28, paragraph 2. Such interim measures may include but shall not be limited to preliminary injunction directed against a party, appointment of receivers or detention, preservation, inspection of property that is the subject of the dispute in arbitration. Either party may apply with the Court for assistance in implementing or enforcing an interim measure ordered by an arbitral tribunal. 
 
 
 
[164]
 Id., Sec. 35 provides: 
 
 
SEC. 35. Coverage of the Law.
 - Construction disputes which fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (the "Commission") shall include those between or among parties to, or who are otherwise bound by, an arbitration agreement, directly or by reference whether such parties are project owner, contractor, subcontractor, fabricator, project manager, design professional, consultant, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer of an insurance policy in a construction project. 
 
 The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is "commercial" pursuant to Section 21 of this Act. 
 
 
 
[165]
 Id., Sec. 39 provides: 
 
 
SEC. 39. Court to Dismiss Case Involving a Construction Dispute.
 - A Regional Trial Court before which a construction dispute is filed shall, upon becoming aware, not later than the pre-trial conference, that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement, dismiss the case and refer the pa ties to arbitration to be conducted by the CIAC, unless both pa ties, assisted by their respective counsel, shall submit to the Regional Trial Court a written agreement exclusively for the Court, rather than the CIAC, to resolve the dispute.

, a direct appeal to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 on pure questions of law; and 
second
,
 an original special civil action for certiorari to the Court of Appeals
 (CA) under Rule 65 on the ground of grave abuse of discretion. 
Nonetheless, I tender this Opinion to respectfully express my reservations against some of the 
ponencia
's discussions pertaining to this second mode of judicial review.


 
I.


 In particular, the 
ponencia
 declares that when it comes
 to the judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards under Rule 65, grave 
abuse of discretion should be further qualified into: 
(
1
) a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal
 (
i.e
., award is procured through fraud, corruption, undue means, or evident partiality on the part of the arbitrators, 
etc
.); and 
(
2
)
 an allegation of the arbitral tribunalâs violation of the Constitution or positive law.
 The first qualification of "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" has been  proposed by the 
ponencia
 as a
 necessary form of contraction of grave abuse of discretion
 that is supposedly warranted by the "unequivocal intent" of the pertinent laws on CIAC arbitration:
  


 Therefore, in the instant case and for purposes of judicial review of the CIAC arbitral awards, 
this
 Court now divines Rule 65, being confined to challenges only to the 
arbitral tribunal's integrity or allegations of its actions' 
unconstitutionality or illegality, to be a warranted contraction of the 
breadth of the concept of 'grave abuse of discretion', in order to 
harmonize a Rule 65 resort with the unequivocal intent of E.O. 1008, and
 other relevant laws, including R.A. 876 and R.A. 9285, which apply 
supplementarily
. To be sure, although E.O. 1008 applies 
specifically to the CIAC as a specialized arbitral institution for the 
construction industry, nothing precludes the Court from applying the 
umbrella legislation of R.A. 876 and its significant amendment, R.A. 
9285. 


 x x x x


 Evidently therefore, the intent of the relevant laws with 
respect to the treatment of arbitral awards is two-tiered: first, that 
they are final as far as their appreciation of the facts that go into 
the merit of the dispute is concerned; and second, in case of obvious 
errors of facts (
e.g
., miscalculations), they are modifiable or 
correctible only insofar as they do not affect the merits of the 
controversy. Such is the restrained attitude that courts were intended 
to maintain with respect to arbitral awards. Such purposively narrow 
windows for changing the arbitral tribunal's award are most in 
consonance with the confined posture towards appeals as unambiguously 
provided for by E.O. 1008, and as fleshed out by R.A. 9285 and the 
Special ADR Rules. 


 x x x x 


 This harmonization is most consistent with the spirit of the law
 which created the CIAC, as was reaffirmed by R.A. 9285 and the Special 
ADR Rules. Accordingly, all rules and regulations that allow the 
contrary, including the pertinent provisions in the Revised 
Administrative Circular No. 1-95, Rule 43 of the Rules and the CIAC 
Rules, should be deemed amended to conform to the rule on direct resort 
to this Court on pure questions of law.
[1]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 The 
ponencia
 further elaborates the need for such qualification:
  


 Further, the resort to a petition for 
certiorari
 under 
Rule 65 is confined to assailing the integrity of the arbitral tribunal 
based on any of the aforementioned factual scenarios (
e.g.
, 
corruption, fraud, evident partiality of the tribunal), or the 
constitutionality or legality of the conduct of the arbitration process,
 
and may not remain unqualified as to embrace other badges of grave abuse
. x x x


 x x x x


 However, far from being static, the very contours of what 
constitutes grave abuse of discretion have always been traced by the 
Court in a judicious but fragmentary manner, as called for by each case 
in jurisprudence. Distinctively, therefore, although the remedy of 
petition for 
certiorari
, as the procedural vehicle, is 
purposefully rigid and unyielding in order to avoid overextension of the
 same over situations that do not raise an error of jurisdiction, the 
concept of grave abuse of discretion which must be alleged to avail of 
the 
certiorari
 remedy is, in the same degree, deliberately 
flexible, in order to enable it to capture a whole spectrum of 
permutations of grave abuse. 
If the case were otherwise, 
i.e.
, if the concept of grave abuse were rigid, and the 
certiorari

 remedy loose, the same would be exposed to the possibility of having a 
clear act of whim and caprice placed beyond the ambit of the court's 
certiorari
 power because of a definitional discomfiture in the legal procedure
. 


 x x x x 


 Indicatively, going by the jurisprudential construction of grave
 abuse of discretion as contemplated by Rule 65, the same decidedly 
casts a wider net than that which is consistent with the narrower 
confines of factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, and covers numerous 
other scenarios apart from that which may amount to a challenge of the 
integrity of a tribunal. The above cases demonstrate badges of grave 
abuse that could not have been contemplated as far as factual review of 
CIAC awards is concerned. To leave this Rule 65 resort unqualified is, 
therefore, to leave it overinclusive, at the expense of the weight and 
conclusiveness of findings of fact of the CIAC. Stated differently, 
precisely because challenging the integrity, constitutionality or 
legality of the tribunal or its actions in the arbitral process are only
 some of the many permutations of grave abuse within the construction of
 Rule 65, the delimitation is crucial for purposes of factual review of 
CIAC arbitral awards, if a resort to a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 is to be made consistent with E.O. 1008.
[2]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) 




 While I have no qualms about the possibility of 
contracting/qualifying grave abuse of discretion into a narrower 
permutation, it is my view that the same must be justified by the 
Constitution or the law. Indeed, it is my position that absent any clear
 constitutional or statutory basis, the Court should not contract grave 
abuse of discretion. 
 As will be explained herein, there is 
simply no constitutional or statutory basis that warrants the 
contraction of grave abuse of discretion into the 
ponencia
's qualification of "a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal," therefore, the 
ponencia
's qualification/contraction of grave abuse of discretion is not justified. 
 To recount, "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" is a term that was first coined in the case of 
CE Construction Corporation v. Araneta Center, Inc
.
[3]
 (
CE Construction
).
 The term is, in concept, a collective category that was meant to 
encapsulate the grounds stated under Section 24 of Republic Act No. (RA)
 876
[4]
 (
Section 24 grounds
), or the general Arbitration Law of 1953. These grounds are as follows: 
  


 (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or


 (b) That there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or


 (c) That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing 
to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to 
hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; that one or 
more of the arbitrators was disqualified to act as such under section 
nine hereof, and willfully refrained from disclosing such 
disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any
 party have been materially prejudiced; or


 (d) That the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so 
imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon 
the subject matter submitted to them was not made. 




 The difference between 
CE Construction
 and the 
ponencia

 is that the former merely adopted previous jurisprudence which referred
 to the Section 24 grounds as mere prototypical examples. 
 Upon careful scrutiny, the 
ponencia
, in some of its parts, has referred to the said grounds as prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion;
[5]

 however, in other parts, it perceives "integrity of the arbitral 
tribunal" not as mere examples, but in itself, a contracted version of 
grave abuse of discretion. These latter portions do not only create the 
impression that the Section 24 grounds are the exclusive grounds to 
assail a CIAC arbitral award, but also renders the 
ponencia
 inconsistent.

 This inconsistency becomes more magnified by the fact that it takes 
great pains to justify the bases for contracting grave abuse of 
discretion into a "challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal" 
(to the extent of delving into the boundaries of the Court's rule-making
 power under the Constitution
[6]
), but, in the end, ultimately recognizes that, as stated above, "
the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law
" is an accepted ground to assail a CIAC arbitral award under Rule 65.
[7]
 To be sure, this latter recognition was actually a modification of the original 
ponencia
, which was borne from my submissions during the deliberations in this case, which I have presented in this wise: 
  


 Essentially, while I concur in the 
ponencia
's result, I 
express reservations on its proposal to contract grave abuse of 
discretion into a narrower permutation called "integrity of the arbitral
 tribunal" insofar as 
certiorari 
challenges against Construction 
Industry Arbitration  Commission (CIAC) arbitral awards are concerned. 
It is my submission that absent any clear constitutional or statutory 
basis, the Court should not contract grave abuse of discretion, 
especially considering the repercussions of this novel approach to other
 cases. Instead, when it comes to CIAC arbitration, it is already 
settled that the grounds under Section 24 of Republic Act No. (RA) 876 
(to which the phrase "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" collectively 
refers to) are only treated as prototypical examples and not exclusive 
grounds, by and of themselves. 
To contract grave abuse into the 
above-stated narrower form is to exclude from judicial review other 
permissible grounds that also constitute jurisdictional errors, such as 
"when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the 
law or existing jurisprudence.
"
[8]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)




 As the present 
ponencia
 now recognizes that a restriction of Rule 65 exclusively to the Section 24 grounds (
i.e.
,
 challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal) would be 
problematic in that it may "exclude from judicial review other 
permissible grounds that also constitute jurisdictional errors, such as 
'when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the 
law or existing jurisprudence,"' it now expressly acknowledges that "an 
allegation of a violation of the Constitution or positive law" is a 
ground to assail CIAC arbitral awards via Rule 65:
  


 Far from being absolute, however, the general rule proscribing 
against judicial review of factual matters admits of exceptions, with 
the standing litmus test that which 
pertain to either a challenge 
on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal, or otherwise an allegation of
 a violation of the Constitution or positive law
. x x x


 x x x x


 In other words, the scenarios that will trigger a factual review
 of the CIAC's arbitral award must fall within either of the following 
sets of grounds: 








(1)


Challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal (
i.e
.,
 (i) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; 
(ii) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of
 any of them); (iii) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in 
refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in 
refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; 
(iv) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such 
under Section 9 of R.A. 876 or "The Arbitration Law", and willfully 
refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other 
misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially 
prejudiced; or (v) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so 
imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon 
the subject matter submitted to them was not made) and; 














(2)


Allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law.








 In addition to the 
prototypical examples
 that 
exceptionally trigger a factual review of the CIAC's arbitral awards, 
the Court here discerns the merit in adding the otherwise forgotten 
presumption that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal may also
 be revisited by the Court upon an allegation that the arbitral tribunal
 committed an act that is violative of the Constitution or other 
positive laws. 
To abate fears, the delimitation discerned in the 
Court's power to review factual findings of the CIAC shall in no way 
plausibly allow for a situation wherein the Court's hand is stayed from 
correcting a blatant Constitutional or legal violation because the 
autonomy of the arbitral process is paramount.
 Contrarily, the Court underscores that the 
contracted or very limited grounds

 for alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CIAC arbitral
 tribunal, however narrow, are still principally tethered to the courts'
 primary duty of upholding the Constitution and positive laws. The 
addition of the second ground makes plain that no amount of contracting 
or expanding grounds for grave abuse will ever be permitted to lay waste
 to the original purpose of the courts and their mandate to uphold the 
rule of law.
[9]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) 




 It should be highlighted that the arbitral tribunal's "violation of the Constitution or positive law" is just a 
reiteration of the traditional notion of grave abuse of discretion as per the prevailing case law on Rule 65.
[10]
 This traditional notion of grave abuse of discretion has been consistently applied to cases elevated on 
certiorari
 in general.
 Thus, as may be gleaned from the above-cited passage in the 
ponencia
, it, 
on the one hand
, purports to contract grave abuse of discretion into 
very limited grounds
 (
i.e
., challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal) 
but in the same breath
, recognizes that a CIAC arbitral award may nonetheless be assailed by 
the general and traditional conception
 of grave abuse of discretion (
i.e
., allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law). 
With all due respect, this approach is clearly inconsistent, as it begs the question
 â 
Is
 the Rule 65 ground to assail a CIAC arbitral award, (1) a specifically 
contracted ground (i.e., challenge on the integrity of the arbitral 
tribunal); (2) a general ground as grave abuse of discretion has been 
understood to apply in all other cases in general (i.e., allegation of 
the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law): 
or (3) is it
 
both?
 More so, it is observed that if the 

ponencia
 already recognizes that CIAC arbitral awards can already be 
assailed by the traditional conception of grave abuse of discretion, 
then there is no more practical value to contract/calibrate grave abuse 
of discretion into a limited ground.
  
 Furthermore, the 
ponencia
's discussions on "challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal" is equally inconsistent: 
on the one hand
, it deems that the Section 24 grounds falling under such term are 
mere prototypical examples
; but 
on the other hand
, it labels them as "
contracted
" or "
very limited grounds
." "Prototypical" means "having the typical qualities of a particular group or kind of person or thing[.]"
[11]
 Thus, when something is a mere "prototypical example," it is only a prime example of a greater class, 
i.e.
,
 grave abuse of discretion, and hence, not exclusive or exhaustive of 
said class. In contrast, when the treatment is that the Section 24 
grounds are, by and of themselves, contracted grounds, then the said 
grounds are deemed exclusive and exhaustive, so as not to allow other 
instances of grave abuse of discretion to assail a CIAC arbitral award. 
Overall, one may therefore ask â 
Are the grounds under Section 24 to 
assail a CIAC arbitral award, exclusive or not? Or are they hath 
exclusive and not exclusive since after all a litigant may assail a CIAC
 arbitral award based on the traditional conception of grave abuse,
 i.e.,
 allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law?


 Respectfully, I am impelled to point out these inconsistencies
 (which I have, in fact, already identified during the deliberations of 
this case
[12]
 but to no avail)
 if only to draw attention to the possible confusion that this may cause
 aggrieved litigants who wish to assail CIAC arbitral awards. 
  
  
 In any case, I submit that, in the final analysis, 
there is really no basis to contract grave abuse of discretion into a "
challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal
" because the grounds under Section 24 of RA 876, refer to a different remedy, 
i.e.
, a motion to vacate, and not a petition for 
certiorari
, which remedy is, in fact, unavailable in arbitration proceedings instituted before the CIAC
. 
 To expound, Section 26, in relation to Section 24, of RA 876 states: 
  


 
Section 26.
 
Motion to Vacate
, 
Modify or Correct Award: When Made
.
 - Notice of a motion to vacate, modify or correct the award must be 
served upon the adverse party or his counsel within thirty days after 
award is filed or delivered, as prescribed by law for the service upon 
an attorney in an action. 


 
Section 24.
 
Grounds for Vacating Award
.-
 In any one of the following cases, the court must make an order 
vacating the award upon the petition of any party to the controversy 
when such party proves affirmatively that in the arbitration 
proceedings:


 (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or 


(b) That there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or


 (c) That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing 
to postpone the bearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to 
hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; that one or 
more of the arbitrators was disqualified to act as such under section 
nine hereof and willfully refrained from disclosing such 
disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any
 party have been materially prejudiced; or 


(d) That the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly
 executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject
 matter submitted to them was not made. 


Where an award is vacated, the court, in its discretion, may 
direct a new hearing either before the same arbitrators or before a new 
arbitrator or arbitrators to be chosen in the manner provided in the 
submission or contract for the selection of the original arbitrator or 
arbitrators, and any provision limiting the time in which the 
arbitrators may make a decision shall be deemed applicable to the new 
arbitration and to commence from the date of the court's order.


 Where the court vacates an award, costs, not exceeding fifty 
pesos and disbursements may be awarded to the prevailing party and the 
payment thereof may be enforced in like manner as the payment of costs 
upon the motion in an action. (Emphases and underscoring supplied) 




 
It should be stressed that RA 876, being the general law on 
arbitration that was passed in 1953, or way before the creation of the 
CIAC in	1985, is not squarely applicable when it comes to CIAC 
arbitration. 
As stated in the law itself, RA 876 contemplates a 
special proceeding in the court 
specified
 in the contract or submission, or if none be specified, the Court of 
First Instance (now, Regional Trial Court) for the province or city in 
which one of the parties resides or is doing business, or in which the 
arbitration was held.
[13]
 On 
the other hand, CIAC arbitration, as its name denotes, is a 
quasi-judicial proceeding that involves disputes arising from, or 
connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in 
construction in the Philippines, where parties agree to submit the 
dispute to voluntary arbitration, 
e.g.
 , pursuant to an arbitration clause, 
specifically instated before the CIAC
.
[14]
 
It is well-established that when it comes to CIAC arbitration, it is the CIAC Law, 
i.e.
, Executive Order No. [EO] 1008,
[15]
 and the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration (CIAC Rules) that govern.
 This is explicitly recognized in Section 34 of RA 9285,
[16]
 or the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, which provides:
  


 Section 34. 
Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law
.
 -	The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by 
Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry 
Arbitration Law. 




 In fact, the Court, in the 2013 case of 
J Plus Asia Development Corporation v. Utility Assurance Corporation
[17]
 (
J Plus
), already recognized that 
CIAC arbitral awards "are x x x 
not
 covered by Rule 11 of the Special ADR Rules, as they continue to be 
governed by EO No. 1008 [(or the CIAC Law)] x x x and the rules of 
procedure of the CIAC
,"
[18]
 
viz
.:
  


 On the procedural issues raised, we find no merit in 
petitioner's contention that with, the institutionalization of 
alternative dispute resolution under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9285, 
otherwise known as the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, the 
CA was divested of jurisdiction to review the decisions or awards of the
 CIAC. Petitioner erroneously relied on the provision in said law 
allowing any party to a domestic arbitration to file in the Regional 
Trial Court (RTC) a petition either to confirm, correct or vacate a 
domestic arbitral award.


 We hold that R.A. No. 9285 did not confer on regional trial 
courts jurisdiction to review awards or decisions of the CIAC in 
construction disputes. On the contrary, Section 40 thereof expressly 
declares that confirmation by the RTC is not required, thus:




 SEC. 40. 
Confirmation of Award
. -  The confirmation of a domestic arbitral award shall be governed by Section 23 of R.A. 876.


 A domestic arbitral award when confirmed shall be enforced in 
the same manner as final and executory decisions of the Regional Trial 
Court.


 The confirmation of a domestic award shall be made by the 
regional trial court in accordance with the Rules of Procedure to be 
promulgated by the Supreme Court. 


 A CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the regional trial court to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008.




 Executive Order (EO) No. 1008 vests upon the CIAC original and 
exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, 
contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the 
Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion 
of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. By express 
provision of Section 19 thereof, the arbitral award of the CIAC is final
 and unappealable, except on questions of law, which are appealable to 
the Supreme Court. x x x


 Petitioner misread the provisions of A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC 
(Special ADR Rules) promulgated by this Court and which took effect on 
October 10, 2009. Since R.A. No. 9285 explicitly excluded CIAC awards 
from domestic arbitration awards that need to be confirmed to be 
executory, said awards are therefore 
not covered by Rule 11
 of the Special ADR Rules[, entitled RULE 11: CONFIRMATION, CORRECTION OR 
VACATION

 OF AWARD IN DOMESTIC ARBITRATION], as they continue to be governed by 
EO No. 1008, as amended and the rules of procedure of the CIAC.
[19]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)




 Under the CIAC Law, the only remedy stated is a Rule 45 appeal to the Supreme Court pure questions of law:
  


 Section 19.
 Finality of Awards
. - The arbitral award 
shall be binding upon the parties. It shall be final and inappealable 
except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme 
Court. 




 Meanwhile, under the CIAC Rules, only a motion to correct an arbitral award is stated in Rule 17 on Post-Award Proceedings: 
  


 RULE 17: POST-AWARD PROCEEDINGS


 Section 17.1 
Motion for Correction of Final Award
. -Any 
of the parties may file a motion for correction of the Final Award 
within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof upon any of the following 
grounds: 




 a. an evident miscalculation of figures, a typographical or arithmetical error; 


 b. an evident mistake in the description of any party, person, date, amount, thing or property referred to in the award; 


 c. where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not 
submitted to them, not affecting the merits of the decision upon the 
matter submitted; 


 d. where the arbitrators have failed or omitted to resolve 
certain issue/s formulated by the parties in the Terms of Reference 
(TOR) and submitted to them for resolution; and


 e. where the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy. 




 The motion shall be acted upon by the Arbitral Tribunal or the surviving/remaining members. 


 17.1.1 The filing of the motion for correction shall interrupt the running of the period for appeal. 


 17.1.2 A motion for correction upon grounds other than those 
mentioned in this section shall not interrupt the running of the period 
for appeal. 


 Section 17.2  
Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial
. - A motion for reconsideration or new trial shall be considered a prohibited pleading. 




 Notably, 
the CIAC Law and the CIAC Rules did not explicitly or 
implicitly carry over the grounds under Section 24 of RA 876; only 
Section 25
[20]
 
(which lists different grounds for modification of an arbitral award) was carried over to Rule 17 of the CIAC Rules.
 
 
There is also no provision that states that the rules on domestic arbitration are suppletorily applicable to CIAC arbitration. 
In fact, with respect to Section 24 of RA 876, its amendatory law, 
i.e
., RA 9285, had already removed the grounds of fraud, collusion, 
etc
.
 in order to vacate a domestic arbitral award. Instead, Section 41 of RA
 9285 expressly states that the grounds to vacate a domestic arbitral 
award shall be "only on those grounds enumerated in Section 25 of [RA] 
876" or those grounds to correct or modify an award found in the old 
law. The same provision states that "[a]ny other ground raised x x x 
shall be disregarded by the Regional Trial Court."
 Neither does 
existing jurisprudence furnish sufficient basis for RA 876's suppletory 
application to CIAC arbitration. To be sure, the 
ponencia
 cites the 2003 case of 
LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc
.
[21]

 to justify the applicability of Section 24 of RA 876 in CIAC 
arbitration. However, upon careful study, the Court, in the said case, 
merely  suggested

 that RA 876, pursuant to Section 7 thereof, be applied to stay the 
regular court proceeding (in which the complaint was first filed) and 
not the CIAC arbitration proceedings
.
 This remedy was suggested so that the arbitration proceedings could 
continue in the CIAC, which continues to be solely governed by the CIAC 
Law and the corresponding CIAC Rules.
[22]
 Nonetheless, as already held in the more recent 2013 case of 
J Plus
,
 the Court already clarified that when it comes to CIAC arbitration, the
 CIAC Law and CIAC Rules govern, and not the general arbitration law, 
i.e
., RA 9285 amending RA 876.
[23]


Based on the foregoing, it is therefore clear that there is no constitutional or statutory basis to justify the 
ponencia
's contraction of grave abuse of discretion into a narrower permutation thereof, 
i.e
., a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal.  
  
 
II.


 If anything, the Section 24 grounds encompassing the phrase 
"a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal" are mere prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion
. As mentioned, the 
ponencia

 is inconsistent on this matter. But to settle the matter once and for 
all, it should be made clear that existing case law has, all the while, 
held that the Section 24 grounds are mere prototypical examples and not 
exclusive Rule 65 grounds. This is evident from the cases of 
Hi-Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc
.
[24]
 (
Hi-Precision
) and 
Spouses David v. CIAC
[25]
 (
Sps. David
), which were cited and adopted in 
CE Construction and Tondo Medical Center v. Rante
[26]
 (
Tondo Medical
).
 To recount, in the 1993 case of 
Hi-Precision
, the Court stated that "[it] will 
not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal

 upon the artful allegation that such body had 'misapprehended the 
facts' and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of 
fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as 'legal 
questions."'
[27]
 On this score, it referred to the Section 24 grounds as 
prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion
:
  


 Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor 
field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that 
matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties 
in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private 
purposes. The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral 
tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended 
the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of
 fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal 
questions." The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the 
arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such 
arbitrators. 
The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to 
relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued
 before the Arbitral Tribunal, 
save only where a very clear showing 
is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal
 committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to 
constitute a grave abuse of discretion
 resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction. 
Prototypical
 examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in
 deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present 
its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through
 fraud or the corruption of arbitrators
.
 Any other, more 
relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a
 voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile
 institution.
[28]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)




 
Hi-Precision
 was later cited in the 2004 case of 
Sps. David

 where the Court likewise stressed the general rule that factual 
findings of an arbitral tribunal should not be disturbed. To flesh out 
this point, the Court quoted the pronouncement in 
Hi-Precision
 that the Section 24 grounds were mere prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion.
[29]
 Eventually, in 2017, the Court promulgated 
CE Construction
, where the phrase "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" was inspired from by the
 ponencia
. Similar to its predecessor cases, 
CE Construction

 never characterized the Section 24 grounds as the exclusive grounds of 
grave abuse of discretion. Rather, in coining the phrase "integrity of 
the arbitral tribunal," 
CE Construction
 only emphasized that 
"factual findings may be reviewed only in cases where the CIAC arbitral 
tribunals conducted their affairs in a haphazard, immodest manner that 
the most basic integrity of the arbitral process was imperiled."
[30]


 In the same light, the Court, in 
Tondo Medical
, citing 
Sps. David
,
 held that "factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and 
conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal, except when the 
petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by 
corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality
 or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators
 were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon 
sufficient cause shown. or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and 
material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were 
disqualified to act as such under section nine of Republic Act No. 876 
and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any
 other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially
 prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so 
imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon 
the subject matter submitted to them was not made."
[31]
 Again, as in previous cases, the Court, in 
Tondo Medical
, never made any qualification that these grounds are contracted permutations of grave abuse of discretion.
  
 Thus, contrary to the 
ponencia
, there is actually no 
case that can be cited as authority to support its notion that the 
Section 24 grounds were already "exported" or "appropriated"
[32]
 by statutory or case law when it comes to CIAC arbitration.

 In fact, aside from the above-stated cases which merely treated the 
Section 24 grounds as prototypical examples, the Court, in the latest 
2020 case of 
Department of Public Works and Highways v. Italian-Thai Development Public Company, Ltd
.
[33]
 (
DPWH
), citing 
Shinryo (Phils.) Company, Inc. v. RRN, Inc
.
[34]
 (
Shinryo
), expressly declared that 
grounds other than those in Section 24 of RA 876 may constitute grave abuse of discretion in CIAC arbitration proceedings
. In 
Shinryo
, the Court reiterated that: 
  


 It is settled that findings of fact of quasi-judicial bodies, 
which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to 
specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect, but also 
finality, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. In 
particular, factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and 
conclusive and nor reviewable by this Court on appeal. 


 This rule, however, admits of certain exceptions. In 
Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation
 [540 Phil. 350 (2006)], we said:


 In [
Sps. David
], we ruled that, as exceptions, factual 
findings of construction arbitrators may be reviewed by this Court when 
the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by 
corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality
 or corruption of the arbitrators or any of them; (3) the arbitrators 
were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and 
material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were 
disqualified to act as such under Section nine of Republic Act No. 876 
and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any
 other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially
 prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so 
imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon 
the subject matter submitted to them was not made.


 
Other recognized exceptions are as follows: (1) when there
 is a very clear showing of grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack 
or loss of jurisdiction as when a party was deprived of a fair 
opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal or when
 an award is obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators, 
(2) when the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of 
the CIAC, and (3) when a party is deprived of administrative due process
.
[35]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 
III.


 In fine, absent any clear constitutional or statutory basis, the 
ponencia
's contraction of grave abuse of discretion is not justified. 
 Furthermore, as herein discussed, the
 ponencia
's contraction creates a logical inconsistency, considering how its discussions contain both the general rule (
i.e
., violation of the Constitution and positive law) and a specific rule (
i.e.,
 challenging the integrity of the arbitral tribunal). This inconsistency becomes more problematic with the 
ponencia
's
 categorization of Section 24 of RA 876 as both a source of exclusive 
grounds and prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion in CIAC 
arbitration proceedings, which this Opinion has clarified to be deemed 
as only prototypical examples consistent with prevailing case law. 
Indeed, albeit its noble intentions, this endeavor leads to more 
confusion than a definite calibration.
 And finally, the 
ponencia
's contraction is also unnecessary since it creates the impression that there are two (2) ways in order to obtain the remedy of 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 when in fact the ground of challenging the integrity of 
the arbitral tribunal should already fall within the traditional 
understanding of grave abuse of discretion. In my view, the traditional 
conception of grave abuse of discretion already subsumes the term 
"integrity of the arbitral tribunal" since after all, an arbitral award 
procured through fraud, corruption, undue means, or evident partiality 
on the part of the arbitrators,
 etc.
 is tantamount to the tribunal's violation of the Constitution and positive law. 
 Ultimately, it is discerned that the 
ponencia
's
 motivation for contracting grave abuse of discretion is to promote the 
policy of deference to party autonomy and to accord respect to the 
CIAC's factual findings due to its expertise on the matter. 
Nevertheless, with all due respect, the solution to this should not be 
made at the expense of stretching the law and settled jurisprudence. To 
my mind, the more prudent approach would be to strictly exhort courts to
 follow Rule 65's truly limited nature by strongly emphasizing its 
extraordinary nature, especially when it comes to assailing factual 
findings of the CIAC. As was cautioned in the case of 
DPWH
: 
  


 The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate 
before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the
 Arbitral Tribunal, 
save only where a 
very clear showing
 is 
made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal 
committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to 
constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of 
jurisdiction
. 
Prototypical examples
 would be factual 
conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the 
other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the 
Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption
 of arbitrators.
[36]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 All told, while I agree in the result, I dissent against the 
ponencia
's
 pronouncements pertaining to the contraction of grave abuse of 
discretion. To recapitulate, my disagreement can be summarized into 
three (3) points: (
a
) there is no clear constitutional or 
statutory basis that justifies the contraction of grave abuse of 
discretion when it comes to a Rule 65 review of CIAC arbitral awards; (
b
) the 
ponencia

 already acknowledges that the instances mentioned in Section 24 of RA 
876 are mere prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion and 
hence, should not be deemed as exclusive grounds therefor; and (
c
) the 
ponencia

 already considers the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution
 or positive law as a ground to assail CIAC arbitral awards on 
certiorari

 and hence, a party may already assail a CIAC arbitral award based on 
grave abuse of discretion's traditional conception that perforce negates
 its further contraction, which after all, lacks basis in law.

[D]espite the above-stated changes in the 
ponencia
, I must
 respectfully point out that the 
ponencia
 still retains its previous 
discussions made in refutation of my Reflections, which, to my mind, are
 inconsistent with its current position already recognizing violations 
of the Constitution and the law as grounds to assail a CIAC arbitral 
award, in addition to the ground of integrity of the arbitral tribunal, 
which ground contemplates the situations listed under Section 24 of RA 
876 only as prototypical examples. Specifically, these discussions 
pertain, in essence, to the following points: (
a
) Section 24 of RA 876 must be replicated as the limited grounds to assail a CIAC arbitral award x x x; (
b
)
 pursuant to the Court's rule-making power, the "elastic" concept of 
grave abuse of discretion permits a narrow contraction of grave abuse of
 discretion to the exclusive grounds listed under Section 24 of RA 876 x
 x x; and (
c
) the relevant laws (
e.g
. RA 876, RA 9285, 
Special ADR Rules) supposedly demonstrate a clear legislative intent to 
contract grave abuse of discretion only to the grounds listed under 
Section 24 of RA 876 x x x (collectively referred to as "subject 
discussions"). 


 To my mind, the subject discussions in the 
ponencia
 are inconsistent with its current position that (
a
)
 the grounds in Section 24 of RA 876 are not exclusive grounds but only 
prototypical examples that affect the integrity of the tribunal; and (
b
) 
certiorari

 challenges are allowed if there are constitutional or legal violations.
 Anent the latter, the ground of violation of the Constitution or 
positive law is not a peculiar ground listed in Section 24 of RA 876, 
but is one which squares with the more traditional understanding of 
grave abuse of discretion, 
i.e
., where there is a patent 
violation of the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence. As such, for 
the sake of consistency, it is respectfully requested that these 
discussions be revisited. Ultimately, the subject discussions all 
purport to contract grave abuse of discretion to the peculiar grounds 
listed in Section 24 of RA 876; this contraction
   is, however, not necessary anymore since the present version of the 

ponencia
 already goes beyond the ambit of Section 24 by recognizing that
 the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution and the law are 
grounds to assail the arbitral award.

SEPARATE OPINION
 


LEONEN, 
J
.:


 I concur with Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa's 
ponencia
. These consolidated cases are an opportune time for this Court, sitting 
en banc
,
 to "untangl[e] the relevant laws and case pronouncements on the extent 
of judicial review of [Construction Industry Arbitration Commission 
(CIAC)] arbitral awards[,] [and come to] a decisive harmonization of the
 standing laws on CIAC review[.]"
[1]
 With this opportunity, I write separately to amplify points previously articulated in 
CE Construction Corporation v. Araneta Center, Inc
.
[2]
 and other decisions in which I had served as 
ponente
. These had been referenced by the present 
ponencia
 as informing its conclusions.

 An immense degree of deference is due to the findings of arbitral 
tribunals of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC). 
The law that created the CIAC, Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known
 as the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, delineates appellate 
jurisdiction from rulings of CIAC arbitral tribunals. It stipulates that
 appeals from such rulings may only be entertained on pure questions of 
law and only before this Court.
 Thus, Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules 
of Civil Procedureâa provision of procedural, and not of substantive 
law, which is ill-equipped to vest jurisdictionâis mistaken in allowing 
appeals to be taken to the Court of  Appeals.
 Still, CIAC 
arbitral tribunals' factual findings are not entirely beyond the reach 
of judicial review. The capacity to pass upon any "grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of 
any branch	or 	instrumentality 	of the 	Government"
[3]

 	is 		a 	constitutionallyÂ­ enshrined, inalienable dimension of judicial
 power.  Thus, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 65âover 
which the Court of Appeals has jurisdictionâcan touch upon factual 
findings in CIAC arbitral tribunal rulings. 
 Nevertheless, 
entertaining Rule 65 petitions must entail an extraordinarily narrow 
conception of grave abuse of discretion committed by CIAC arbitral 
tribunals. Entertaining such petitions must be consistent with our 
general framework on vacating arbitral awards, as seminally expressed in
 Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876, otherwise known as the Arbitration 
Law.
[4]
 Thus, in the 
context of a Rule 65 petition, the Court of Appeals can review the 
factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals only "in instances when the 
integrity of the arbitral tribunal itself has been put in jeopardy."
[5]

 In addition, because of the basic primacy of the Constitution and the 
imperative of harmonious application of laws, the Court of Appeals may 
also review factual findings when there is grave abuse of discretion 
made by way of violation of the Constitution or our laws. Review of 
factual findings on any ground which goes into considerations other than
 the very integrity of a CIAC arbitral tribunal (as contemplated in 
Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876) or those tribunals' outright 
violation of the Constitution or laws is an excessive, invalid review 
via certiorari.
 
I


 The CIAC serves the interest not only of speedy dispute resolution, but also of 
authoritative
 dispute resolution.
[6]
 It was created with a particular view of enabling "early and expeditious settlement of disputes[,]"
[7]
 aware of the exceptional role of construction to "'the furtherance of national development goals."
[8]
 
CE Construction 
detailed the legal framework within which the CIAC operates:
  


 The Construction Industry Arbitration Commission was a creation 
of Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction 
Industry Arbitration Law. At inception, it was under the administrative 
supervision of the Philippine Domestic Construction Board which, in 
turn, was an implementing agency of the Construction Industry Authority 
of the Philippines (CIAP). The CIAP is presently attached to the 
Department of Trade and Industry.


 The CIAC was created with the specific purpose of an "early and 
expeditious settlement of disputes" cognizant of the exceptional role of
 construction to "the furtherance of national development goals."


 Section 4 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law spells out the jurisdiction of the CIAC:




 Section 4. Jurisdiction. â The CIAC shall have original and 
exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, 
contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the 
Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion 
of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These 
disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to 
acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the 
same to voluntary arbitration.


 The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to
 violation of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of
 the terms of agreement; interpretation and/or application of 
contractual time and delays; maintenance and defects: payment, default 
of employer or contractor and changes in contract cost. 


 Excluded from the coverage of this law are disputes arising 
from employer-employee relationships which shall continue to be covered 
by the Labor Code of the Philippines.




 Though created by the act of a Chief Executive who then 
exercised legislative powers concurrently with the Batasang Pambansa, 
the creation, continuing existence, and competence of the CIAC have 
since been validated by acts of Congress.


 Republic Act No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, 
enacted on January 10, 2003, explicitly recognized and confirmed the 
competence of the CIAC:




 Section 59. Arbitration. â Any and all disputes arising from 
the implementation of a contract covered by this Act shall 	be	submitted
 to 	arbitration in the 	Philippines according to the provisions of 
Republic Act No. 876, otherwise known as the "Arbitration Law". 
Provided, however, That, disputes that are within the competence of the 
Construction	Industry Arbitration 	Commission to resolve shall be 
referred thereto. The process of arbitration shall be incorporated as a 
provision in the contract that will be executed pursuant to the 
provisions of this Act: Provided, That by mutual agreement, the parties 
may agree in writing to resort to alternative modes of dispute 
resolution.




 Arbitration of construction disputes through the CIAC was 
formally incorporated into the general statutory framework on 
alternative dispute resolution through Republic Act No. 9285, the 
Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004 (ADR Law) Chapter 6, Section 
34 of ADR Law made specific reference to the Construction Industry 
Arbitration Law, while Section 35 confirmed the CIACâs jurisdiction. 




 CHAPTER 6 
ARBITRATION OF CONSTRUCTION DISPUTES
  




 Section 34. Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing 
Law. - The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by 
Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry 
Arbitration Law. 


 Section 35. Coverage of the Law. â Construction disputes which
 fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Construction
 Industry Arbitration Commission (the "Commission") shall include those 
between or among parties to, or who are otherwise bound by, an 
arbitration agreement, directly or by reference whether such parties are
 project owner, contractor, subcontractor, fabricator, project manager, 
design professional, consultant, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer 
of an insurance policy in a construction project.




 The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive
 jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is 
"commercial" pursuant to Section 21 of this Act.
[9]
 (Citations omitted)




 The CIAC is a statutory creation. It was created by an executive 
order promulgated by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos (President 
Marcos) in  the exercise of legislative powers which were then lodged in
 him. The statute that created it spelled out not only the CIAC's 
jurisdiction in its Section 4, but also the finality of CIAC decisions 
and mode of appeal in its Section 19.
[10]
 
CE Construction

 detailed the intricacies of the CIAC as a statutory creation, even 
though President Marcos did not use the usual modality (i.e., 
presidential decree) of his legislative enactments: 
  


 Though nominally an "executive order," the Construction Industry Arbitration Law is a statute. 


 Jurisprudence has clarified that, in exercising legislative 
powers, then President Marcos did not only use the modality of 
presidential decrees, but also of executive orders and letters of 
instruction. Though, this is not to say that all executive orders and 
letters of instruction issued by him are statutes. 


 In 
Parong, et al. v. Enrile
: 




 To form part of the law of the land, the decree, order or 
[letter of instruction] must be issued by the President in the exercise 
of his extraordinary power of legislation as contemplated in Section 6 
of the 1976 amendments to the Constitution, whenever in his judgment, 
there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or 
whenever the interim Batasan[g] Pambansa or the regular National 
Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any 
reason that in his judgment requires immediate action. 




 Associate Justice Irene Cortes noted that certain executive 
orders and letters of instruction have indeed been on par with President
 Marcos' more commonly used mode of legislation (i.e., presidential 
decrees): 




 Another problem arises from lack of precision in the 
appropriate use of one form of issuance as against another. A 
presidential decree is equivalent to a statute enacted by the 
legislature, and is thus superior to implementing rules issued as 
executive orders or letter of instructions. But, it is not unheard, of 
for an executive order to amend or repeal a presidential decree or a 
letter of instructions to amend an executive order, or lay down a rule 
of law. 




 Associate Justice Cortes specifically cited as an example Exec. 
Order No. 543 (1979), which abolished the Philippine Center for Advanced
 Studies, a creation of Pres. Decree No. 342 (1973). In disproving that 
Exec. Order No. 543 was issued merely as an implementing rule, she 
explained that its object - a state university - could not have fallen 
under the scope of the President's reorganization powers, for which an 
executive order issued merely as an implementing rule was sufficient. 


 The Construction Industry Arbitration Law's own nomenclature 
reveals the intent that it be a statute. Its whereas clauses and 
declaration of policy reveal the urgency that impelled immediate action 
for the President to exercise his concurrent legislative powers. 


 Any doubt on the statutory efficacy of the Construction Industry
 Arbitration Law is addressed by Congress' own, voluntary and repeated 
reference to and affirmation of it as such a law. (See Rep. Act No. 9184
 and Rep. Act No. 9285). Rep. Act No. 9285 did not only validate the 
Construction Industry Arbitration Law, it also incorporated it into the 
general statutory framework of alternative dispute resolution. 


 Jurisprudence, too, has repeatedly and consistently referred to it as such a "law."
[11]




 
CE Construction
 further discussed: 
  


 The creation of a special adjudicatory body for construction 
disputes presupposes distinctive and nuanced competence on matters that 
are conceded to be outside the innate expertise of regular courts and 
adjudicatory bodies concerned with other specialized fields.
[12]




 It drew attention to how the CIAC is a "quasi-judicial, 
administrative agency equipped with technical proficiency that enables 
it to efficiently and promptly resolve conflicts."
[13]
 
CE Construction
 explained: 
  


 The CIAC does not only serve the interest of speedy dispute resolution, it also facilitates 
authoritative

 dispute resolution. Its authority proceeds not only from juridical 
legitimacy but equally from technical expertise. The creation of a 
special adjudicatory body for construction disputes presupposes 
distinctive and nuanced competence on matters that are conceded to be 
outside the innate expertise of regular courts and adjudicatory bodies 
concerned with other specialized fields. The CIAC has the state's 
confidence concerning the entire technical expanse of construction, 
defined in jurisprudence as "referring to all on-site works on buildings
 or altering structures, from land clearance through completion 
including excavation, erection and assembly and installation of 
components and equipment." 


 Jurisprudence has characterized the CIAC as a quasi-judicial, 
administrative agency equipped with technical proficiency that enables 
it to efficiently and promptly resolve conflicts: 




 [The CIAC] is a quasi-judicial agency. A quasi-judicial agency
 or body has been defined as an organ of government other than a court 
and other than a legislature, which affects the rights of private 
parties through either adjudication or rule-making. The very definition 
of an administrative agency includes its being vested with 
quasi-judicial powers. The ever increasing variety of powers and 
functions given to administrative agencies recognizes the need for the 
active intervention of administrative agencies in matters calling for 
technical knowledge and speed in countless controversies which cannot 
possibly be handled by regular courts. The CIAC's primary function is 
that of a quasi-judicial agency, which is to adjudicate claims and/or 
determine rights in accordance with procedures set forth in E.O. No. 
1008. 




 The most recent jurisprudence maintains that the CIAC is a quasi-judicial body. This Court's November 23, 2016 Decision in 
Fruehauf Electronics v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific

 distinguished construction arbitration, as well as voluntary 
arbitration pursuant to Article 219(14) of the Labor Code, from 
commercial arbitration. It ruled that commercial arbitral tribunals are 
not quasi-judicial agencies, as they are purely ad hoc bodies operating 
through contractual consent and as they intend to serve private, 
proprietary interests. In contrast, voluntary arbitration under the 
Labor Code and construction arbitration operate through the statutorily 
vested jurisdiction of government instrumentalities that exist 
independently of the will of contracting parties and to which these 
parties submit. They proceed from the public interest imbuing their 
respective spheres: 




 Voluntary Arbitrators resolve labor disputes and grievances 
arising from the interpretation of Collective Bargaining Agreements. 
These disputes were specifically excluded from the coverage of both the 
Arbitration Law and the ADR Law. 




 Unlike purely commercial relationships, the relationship between
 capital and labor are heavily impressed with public interest. Because 
of this, Voluntary Arbitrators authorized to resolve labor disputes have
 been clothed with quasi-judicial authority. 


 On 	the 	other 	hand, 	commercial 		relationships covered by our
 commercial arbitration laws are purely private 	and	contractual 	in	 
nature.  Unlike 	labor relationships, they do not possess the same 
compelling state interest that would justify state interference into the
 autonomy of contracts. Hence, commercial arbitration is a purely 
private system of adjudication facilitated by private citizens instead 
of government instrumentalities wielding quasi-judicial powers. 


 Moreover, judicial or quasi-judicial jurisdiction cannot be 
conferred upon a tribunal by the parties alone. The Labor Code itself 
confers subject-matter jurisdiction to Voluntary Arbitrators. 


 
Notably, the other arbitration body listed in Rule 43 â the 
Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) â is also a 
government agency attached to the Department of Trade and Industry. 	Its
 jurisdiction is likewise conferred by statute. By contrast, the 
subject-matter jurisdiction of commercial arbitrators is stipulated by 
the parties
.

 Attesting to the primacy of technical expertise in enabling the CIAC's competence, 
CE Construction
 noted that technical proficiency is the foremost consideration in being an arbitrator in the CIAC:
  


 Consistent with the primacy of technical mastery, Section 14 of 
the Construction Industry Arbitration Law on the qualification of 
arbitrators provides:




 Section 14. Arbitrators. â A sole arbitrator or three arbitrators may settle a dispute.


 . . . .


 Arbitrators shall be men of .distinction in whom the business 
sector and the government can have confidence. They shall not be 
permanently employed with the CIAC. Instead, they shall render services 
only when called to arbitrate. For each dispute they settle, they shall 
be given fees.




 Section 8.1 of the Revised Rules of Procedure Governing 
Construction Arbitration establishes that the foremost qualification of 
arbitrators shall be technical proficiency. It explicitly enables not 
only lawyers but also "engineers, architects, construction managers, 
engineering consultants, and businessmen familiar with the construction 
industry" to serve as arbitrators:




 Section 8.1 General Qualification of Arbitrators. â The 
Arbitrators shall be men of distinction in whom the business sector and 
the government can have confidence. 
They shall be technically qualified to resolve any construction dispute expeditiously and equitably
.
 The Arbitrators shall come from different professions. They may include
 engineers, architects, construction managers, engineering consultants, 
and businessmen familiar with the construction industry and lawyers who 
are experienced in construction disputes. (Emphasis supplied)




 Of the 87 CIAC-accredited arbitrators as of January 2017, only 
33 are lawyers. The majority are experts from construction-related 
professions or engaged in related fields.


 Apart from arbitrators, technical experts aid the CIAC in 
dispute resolution. Section 15 of the Construction Industry Arbitration 
Law provides:




 Section 15. Appointment of Experts. â The services of 
technical or legal experts may be utilized in the settlement of disputes
 if requested by any of the parties or by the Arbitral Tribunal. If the 
request for an expert is done by either or by both of the parties, it is
 necessary that the appointment of the expert be confirmed by the 
Arbitral Tribunal.


 Whenever the parties request for the services of an expert, 
they shall equally shoulder the expert's fees and expenses, half of 
which shall be deposited with the Secretariat before the expert renders 
service. When only one party makes the request, it shall deposit the 
whole amount required.
[15]
 (Citations omitted) 






 
II


 In view of the CIAC's unique technical expertise, primacy and 
immense deference is accorded to CIAC arbitral tribunal decisions. This 
means that there can only be "a very narrow room for assailing [their] 
rulings."
[16]
 Accordingly, 
Section 19 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law provides that 
CIAC arbitral awards cannot be assailed, except on pure questions of law
 and only before this Court:
  


 SECTION 19. Finality of Awards. â The arbitral award shall be 
binding upon the parties. It shall be final and inappealable except on 
questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court.




 Since the Construction Industry Arbitration Law's adoption in 
1985, procedural law and related jurisprudence have made it appear that 
appeals may also be taken to the Court of Appeals. There, the factual 
findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may supposedly be assailed. This has
 been an unfortunate mistake. The Court of Appeals' supposed appellate 
jurisdiction to freely review factual issues finds no basis in 
substantive law.
  
 On February 27, 1991, this Court adopted Circular No. 1-91, 
"Prescribing the Rules Governing Appeals to the Court of Appeals from a 
Final Order or Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals and Quasi-Judicial 
Agencies."
 Section 3 of Circular No. 1-91 enabled appeals from 
decisions of quasi-judicial agencies to be taken to the Court of Appeals
 on questions of fact, questions of law, or both questions of fact and 
law. Section 1 made this recourse available in all cases where appeals 
were "allowed by statute to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court." 
Further, Section 1 also listed some quasi-judicial agencies whose 
decisions may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. This enumeration did 
not include the CIAC. Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Circular No. 1-91 read:
  


 1. Scope. â These rules shall apply to appeals from final orders
 or decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. They shall also apply from 
final orders or decisions on any quasi-judicial agency from which an 
appeal is now allowed by statute to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme 
Court. Among these agencies are the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil 
Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology 
Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory 
Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Secretary of Agrarian 
Reforms and Special Agrarian Courts under RA 6657, Government Service 
Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural 
Inventions Board, Insurance Commission and Philippine Atomic Energy 
Commission.


 2. Case not covered. â These rules shall not apply to decisions 
and interlocutory orders of the National Labor Relations Commission or 
the Secretary of Labor and Employment under the Labor Code of the 
Philippines, the Central Board of Assessment Appeals, and other 
quasi-judicial agencies from which no appeal to the courts is prescribed
 or allowed by statute.


 3. Who may appeal and where to appeal. â The appeal of a party 
affected by a final order, decision, or judgment of the Court of Tax 
Appeals or of a quasi-judicial agency shall be taken to the Court of 
Appeals within the period in the manner herein provided, whether the 
appeal involved questions of fact or of law or mixed questions of fact 
and law. From final judgments or decisions of the Court of Appeals, the 
aggrieved party may appeal by certiorari to the Supreme Court as 
provided in Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.




 Republic Act No. 7902, amending Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 or the 
Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, was approved on February 23, 1995.
 It stated that the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Court of 
Appeals includes "all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or
 awards of. . . quasi-judicial agencies. . . 
except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court[:]
"
  


 SECTION 1. Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended, 
known as the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, is hereby further 
amended to read as follows: 




 "Sec. 9. 	Jurisdiction. â The Court of Appeals shall exercise: 


 . . . .


 "(3) 
Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of
 Regional Trial Courts and 
quasi-judicial agencies
,
 instrumentalities, boards or commissions, including the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Employees 
Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, 
except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution
,
 the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as
 amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the 
third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 
17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.


 . . . . (Emphasis supplied) 






 On May 16, 1995, this Court adopted Circular No. 1-95, revising 
Circular No. 1-91. Unlike Circular No. 1-91, Circular No. 1-95 
explicitly included the CIAC as among those quasi-judicial agencies 
whose awards and judgments may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
Section 1 of Circular No. 1-95 reads: 
  


 1. SCOPE. â These rules shall apply to appeals from judgments or
 final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, 
final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial 
agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. 
Among these agencies are the

 Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, Land Registration Authority, Social 
Security Commission, Office of the President, Civil Aeronautics Board, 
Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National 
Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National 
Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under 
Republic Act 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees 
Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance 
Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, 
and 
Construction Industry Arbitration Commission
. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The rules stated in Circular No. 1-95 were formally included in 
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 43, Sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 
substantially reproduced
[17]
 Sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Circular No. 1-95.
[18]

 As with Circular No. 1-95, Rule 43, Section 1 expressly includes the 
CIAC as among those quasi-judicial agencies whose awards and judgments 
may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
 This Court's 2001 Decision in 
Metro Construction v. Chatham Properties
[19]

 offers a rationalization for why CIAC awards may supposedly be appealed
 to the Court of Appeals. There, this Court alluded to a "procedural 
mutation" from Circular No. 1-91, to Circular No. 1-95, and through to 
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. It also cited Republic Act No. 7902 
as statutory basis: 
  


 Through Circular No. 1-91, the Supreme Court intended to 
establish a uniform procedure for the review of the final orders or 
decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals and other quasi-judicial agencies 
provided that an appeal therefrom is then allowed under existing 
statutes to either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. The 
Circular designated the Court of Appeals as the reviewing body to 
resolve questions of fact or of law or mixed questions of fact and law. 


 It is clear that Circular No. 1-91 covers the CIAC. In the first
 place, it is a quasi-judicial agency. A quasi-judicial agency or body 
has been defined as an organ of government other than a court and other 
than a legislature, which affects the rights of private parties through 
either adjudication or rule-making. The very definition of an 
administrative agency includes its being vested with quasi-judicial 
powers. The ever increasing variety of powers and functions given to 
administrative agencies recognizes the need for the active intervention 
of administrative agencies in matters calling for technical knowledge 
and speed in countless controversies which cannot possibly be handled by
 regular courts. The CIAC's primary function is that of a quasi-judicial
 agency, which is to adjudicate claims and/or determine rights in 
accordance with procedures set forth in E.O. No. 1008. 


 In the second place, the language of Section 1 of Circular No. 
1-91 emphasizes the obvious inclusion of the CIAC even if it is not 
named in the enumeration of quasi-judicial agencies. The introductory 
words "[a]mong these agencies are" preceding the enumeration of specific
 quasi-judicial agencies only highlight the fact that the list is not 
exclusive or conclusive. Further, the overture stresses and acknowledges
 the existence of other quasi-judicial agencies not included in the 
enumeration but should be deemed included. In addition, the CIAC is 
obviously excluded in the catalogue of cases not covered by the Circular
 and mentioned in Section 2 thereof for the reason that at the time the 
Circular took effect, E.O. No. 1008 allows appeals to the Supreme Court 
on questions of law. 


 In sum, under Circular No. 1-91, appeals from the arbitral 
awards of the CIAC may be brought to the Court of Appeals, and not to 
the Supreme Court alone. The grounds for the appeal are likewise 
broadened to include appeals on questions of facts and appeals involving
 mixed questions of fact and law. 


 The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over appeals from final
 orders or decisions of the CIAC is further fortified by the amendments 
to B.P. Blg. 129, as introduced by R.A. No. 7902. With the amendments, 
the Court of Appeals is vested with appellate jurisdiction over all 
final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional 
Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or 
commissions, except "those within the appellate jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the
 Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the 
provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph 
and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the 
Judiciary Act of 1948." 


 . . . .


 Any remaining doubt on the procedural mutation of the provisions
 on appeal in E.O. No. 1008, vis-a-vis Circular No. 1-91 and R.A. No. 
7902, was completely removed with the issuance by the Supreme Court of 
Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 and the 1997 Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Both categorically include the CIAC in the enumeration of 
quasi-judicial agencies comprehended therein. Section 3 of the former 
and Section 3, Rule 43 of the latter, explicitly expand the issues that 
may be raised in an appeal from quasi-judicial agencies or 
instrumentalities to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the 
manner therein provided. Indisputably, the review of the CIAC award may 
involve either questions of fact, of law, or of fact and law. 


 In view of all the foregoing, we reject MCI's submission that 
Circular No. 1-91, B.P. Blg. 129, as amended by R.A. 7902, Revised 
Administrative Circular 1-95, and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil 
Procedure failed to efficaciously modify the provision on appeals in 
E.O. No. 1008. We further discard MCI's claim that these amendments have
 the effect of merely changing the forum for appeal from the Supreme 
Court to the Court of Appeals.
[20]
 (Citations omitted) 




 It is opportune to repudiate the mistaken notion that appeals on 
questions of fact of CIAC awards may be coursed through the Court of 
Appeals. No statute actually vests jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals 
to entertain petitions for review emanating from the CIAC. 
 
Metro Construction
's
 reference to a "procedural mutation" effected by Circular No. 1-91, 
Circular No. 1-95, and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure does
 not broaden the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Neither do the 
amendments introduced to Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 by Republic Act No. 
7902 broaden the Court of Appeals' appellate jurisdiction as to extend 
it to a factual review of CIAC arbitral awards. 
 It is elementary that jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law, not of procedural law: 
  


 [J]urisdiction is "the power to hear and determine cases of the 
general class to which the proceedings in question belong." Jurisdiction
 is a matter of substantive law. Thus, 
an action may be filed only with the court or tribunal where the Constitution or a statute says it can be brought
.
[21]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The Construction Industry Arbitration Lawâthrough its Section 19, 
in relation to this Court's constitutionally-established appellate 
jurisdiction
[22]
âis the 
only

 substantive law which pronounces which court has appellate jurisdiction
 over CIAC arbitral awards: "It shall be final and inappealable 
except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court
." 
  
 Its pronouncement on how appellate jurisdiction exclusively 
resided in this Court was not modified or otherwise affected by Republic
 Act No. 7902. 
 Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 had long been in force 
when the Construction Industry Arbitration Law was adopted in 1985. 
Prior to its amendment in 1995, Section 9(3) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 
already vested the then Intermediate Appellate Court with exclusive 
appellate jurisdiction over "final judgments, decisions, resolutions, 
orders, or awards. . . quasi-judicial agencies. . . except those falling
 within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance 
with the Constitution," just as Republic Act No. 7902 did with the Court
 of Appeals: 
  


 SECTION 9. Jurisdiction. â The Intermediate Appellate Court shall exercise: 


 . . . .








(3)


Exclusive appellate 
jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders, 
or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, 
instrumentalities, boards, or commissions, except those falling within 
the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the 
Constitution, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the
 third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section
 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. 










The Construction Industry Arbitration Law could not have been 
ignorant of the then Intermediate Appellate Court's appellate 
jurisdiction. When the Construction Industry Arbitration Law made 
appeals on questions of law exclusive to this Court, it was with a 
complete awareness that regular appeals could have otherwise also been 
made available through the Intermediate Appellate Court. Still, it 
deliberately elected to make no such appeal available. 


 Section 19 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law 
calculatedly made Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 9(3)âa counterpart 
statutory provision on appellate jurisdictionâineffectual to appeals 
involving factual review of CIAC arbitral awards. 
 Republic Act 
No. 7902 did amend Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 9(3). However, its 
amendments added only two statements: first, an enumeration of examples 
of quasi-judicial agencies whose decisions were subject to the Court of 
Appeals' appellate jurisdiction;
[23]

 and second, a reference to the Labor Code in its consideration of the 
exceptions to the Court of Appeals' exclusive appellate jurisdiction.
[24]

 Thus, despite Republic Act No. 7902's amendments, Batas Pambansa Blg. 
129, Section 9(3)'s operative clause remained unchanged, that is, that 
the renamed 	Court 	of Appeals would 	exercise "[e]xclusive appellate 
jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or
 awards of . . . quasi-judicial agencies . . . except those falling 
within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance 
with the Constitution":

including the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Employees 
Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, 






 






except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution. 






 






the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended,






 






the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph ( 1) of 
the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of 
Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. 






 












If, in 1985, this operative clause did not sway the Construction 
Industry Arbitration Law to enable regular factual appeals to the 
Intermediate Appellate Court, then, neither should its verbatim 
restatement, in 1995, enable appeals on factual issues to the Court of 
Appeals. 


 With the inefficacy of Republic Act No. 7902, 
Metro Construction
's
 proffered "procedural mutation" is left with nothing to rely on except,
 as its own terminology implies, mere provisions of procedural law: 
first, Circular No. 1-91; second, Circular No. 1-95; and third, Rule 43,
 Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. 
 Still, these 
are not constitutional or statutory substantive law provisions. Thus, 
they fail to vest appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards in the Court 
of Appeals. Contrary to what 
Metro Construction 
stated, they could not have "broadened"
[25]
 appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards, or "expand[ed] the issues"
[26]
 (i.e., the subject matter) that may be considered in appeals of CIAC awards. 

 While there seemed to have been basis for expanding appeals, there has 
also been an apparent basis for totally restricting appeals. 
 
Another seeming basis for concluding that appellate jurisdiction over	 
CIAC Awards has been altered is A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC, the Special Rules 
of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (the Special ADR Rules). Rule
 19.7 of these Rules precludes parties who submit themselves to 
arbitration from questioning arbitral awards, whether by appeal or by 
certiorari: 
  


 Rule 19.7. No appeal or certiorari on the merits of an arbitral 
award. - An agreement to refer a dispute to arbitration shall mean that 
the arbitral award shall be final and binding. 


 Consequently, a party to an arbitration is precluded from filing
 an appeal or a petition for certiorari questioning the merits of an 
arbitral award. 




 The disallowance of appeals under the Special ADR Rules is 
consistent with the ADR Law. While Section 46 of the ADR Law 
contemplates appeals subsequent to arbitration proceedings, it pertains 
only to appeals from regional trial court decisions "confirming, 
vacating, setting aside, modifying or correcting an arbitral award," not
 to appeals from an arbitral award itself: 
  


 SECTION 46. Appeal from Court Decisions on Arbitral Awards. â A 
decision of the Regional Trial Court confirming, vacating, setting 
aside, modifying or correcting an arbitral award may be appealed to the 
Court of Appeals in accordance with the rules of procedure to be 
promulgated by the Supreme Court. 


 The losing party who appeals from the judgment of the court 
confirming an arbitral award shall be required by the appellate court to
 post a counterbond executed in favor of the prevailing party equal to 
the amount of the award in accordance with the rules to be promulgated 
by the Supreme Court.




Fruehauf Electronics Philippines Corporation v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation
[27]
 confirms that appeals are not a remedy against arbitral awards: 
  


 The errors of an arbitral tribunal are not subject to correction
 by the judiciary. As a private alternative to court proceedings, 
arbitration is meant to be an end, not the beginning, of litigation. 
Thus, the arbitral award is final and binding on the parties by reason 
of their contract â the arbitration agreement.
[28]
 (Citations omitted) 




 However, the same 
Fruehauf
 Decision has settled that 
construction arbitration through the quasi-judicial mechanism of the 
CIAC must be distinguished from general commercial arbitration through 
contractually established arbitral tribunals. This, even as the ADR 
Lawâin Chapter 6âreferences construction arbitration. 
Fruehauf
 clearly states that "as a quasi- judicial body, the CIAC's awards are specifically made appealable to this Court by law[.]"
[29]


 Thus, the mechanics of appeals, as originally spelled out by 
the Construction Industry Arbitration Law in 1985, remain unaltered. 
Appeals have not been expanded to possibly be coursed through the Court 
of Appeals, 
and
 there raise factual issues, as 
Metro Construction

 and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure state. Neither have 
they been restricted or entirely negated, as the Special ADR Rules 
suggest. 
 
III


 
CE Construction
 explained the practical import of Rule 
43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. 	It emphasized that Rule 43 did
 not abandon the exclusiveness of appeals to questions of law: 
  


 Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure standardizes 
appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. Rule 43, Section 1 explicitly 
lists the CIAC as among the quasi-judicial agencies covered by Rule 43. 
Section 3 indicates that appeals through Petitions for Review under Rule
 43 are to "be taken to the Court of Appeals . . . whether the appeal 
involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law."
 


 This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral 
tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's 
statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or 
mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the 
disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: there were those 
that enabled questions of fact; there were those that enabled questions 
of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law. 
Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all 
appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals. 
However, in keeping with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any 
appeal from CIAC arbitral tribunals must remain limited to questions of 
law. 


 
Hi-Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc
. explained the wisdom underlying the limitation of appeals to pure questions of law: 




 Section 19 makes it crystal clear that questions of fact 
cannot be raised in proceedings before the Supreme Court â which is not a
 trier of facts â in respect of an arbitral award rendered under the 
aegis of the CIAC. Consideration of the animating "purpose of voluntary 
arbitration in general, and arbitration under the aegis of the CIAC in 
particular, requires us to apply rigorously the above principle embodied
 in Section 19 that the Arbitral Tribunal's findings of fact shall be 
final and unappealable. 


 Voluntary arbitration involves the reference of a dispute to 
an impartial body, the members of which are chosen by the parties 
themselves, which parties freely consent in advance to abide by the 
arbitral award issued after proceedings where both parties had the 
opportunity to be heard. The basic objective is to provide a speedy and 
inexpensive method of settling disputes by allowing the parties to avoid
 the formalities, delay, expense and aggravation which commonly 
accompany ordinary litigation, especially litigation which goes through 
the entire hierarchy of courts. [The Construction Industry Arbitration 
Law] created an arbitration facility to which the construction industry 
in the Philippines can have recourse. The [Construction Industry 
Arbitration Law] was enacted to encourage the early and expeditious 
settlement of disputes in the construction industry, a public policy the
 implementation of which is necessary and important for the realization 
of national development goals. 




 Consistent with this restrictive approach, this Court is 
duty-bound to be extremely watchful and to ensure that an appeal does 
not become an ingenious means for undermining the integrity of 
arbitration or for conveniently setting aside the conclusions that 
arbitral processes make. Appeals are not an artifice for the parties to 
undermine the process they voluntarily elected to engage in. To prevent 
this Court from being a party to such perversion, this Court's 
primordial inclination must be to uphold the factual findings of 
arbitral tribunals: 




 Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor 
field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that 
matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties 
in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private 
purposes. 
The Court will not review the factual findings of an 
arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had 
"misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at 
bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be 
as "legal questions."
 The parties here had recourse to arbitration 
and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in 
such arbitrators. 	
The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties 
to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and 
argued before the Arbitral Tribunal
, save only where a very clear 
snowing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral 
Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to 
constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of 
jurisdiction. Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the 
Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a 
fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, 
and an award 	obtained 	through 	fraud 	or 	the 		corruption 	of 
arbitrators. 
Any other more relaxed, rule would result in setting at 
naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce 
arbitration to a largely inutile institution

 Section 19 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law's 
limitation of appeals to questions of law echoes Section 29 of Republic 
Act No. 876, the Arbitration Law that had previously been in effect: 
  


 SECTION 29. Appeals. - An appeal may be taken from an order made
 in a proceeding under this Act, or from a judgment entered upon an 
award through certiorari proceedings, 
but such appeals shall be limited to questions of law
.
 The proceedings upon such an appeal, including the judgment thereon 
shall be governed by the Rules of Court in so far as they are 
applicable. (Emphasis supplied) 




 However, despite Section 29, Republic Act No. 876 also provided 
grounds for vacating arbitral awards. These grounds concern "instances 
when the integrity of the arbitral tribunal itself has been put in 
jeopardy":
[31]




 SECTION 24. Grounds for vacating award. - In any one of the 
following cases, the court must make an order vacating the award upon 
the petition of any party to the controversy when such party proves 
affirmatively that in the arbitration proceedings: 








(a)


The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or






 


 






(b)


That there was evident partiality or corruption m the arbitrators or any of them; or 






 


 






(c)


That the arbitrators were guilty of 
misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause 
shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the 
controversy; that one or more of the arbitrators was disqualified to act
 as such under section nine hereof, and wilfully refrained from 
disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which 
the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or 






 


 






(d)


That the arbitrators exceeded their 
powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and 
definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.








Where an award is vacated, the court, in its discretion, may 
direct a new hearing either before the same arbitrators or before a new 
arbitrator or arbitrators to be chosen in the manner provided in the 
submission or contract for the selection of the original arbitrator or 
arbitrators, and any provision limiting the time in which the 
arbitrators may make a decision shall be deemed applicable to the new 
arbitration and to commence from the date of the court's order.


 Where the court vacates an award, costs, not exceeding fifty 
pesos and disbursements may be awarded to the prevailing party and the 
payment thereof may be enforced in like manner as the payment of costs 
upon the motion in an action.




 Echoing the four highly exceptional grounds stipulated by Section 
24 of Republic Act No. 876, jurisprudence has recognized extremely 
restrictive grounds for revisiting factual issues involved in an 
arbitral tribunal's decision. Citing 
Spouses David v. Construction Industry and Arbitration Commission
,
[32]
 
CE Construction
 explained:
  


 Thus, even as exceptions to the highly restrictive nature of 
appeals may be contemplated, these exceptions are only on the narrowest 
on grounds. Factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may be revisited
 not merely because arbitral tribunals may have erred, not even on the 
already exceptional grounds traditionally available in Rule 45 
Petitions. Rather, 
factual findings may be reviewed only in cases 
where CIAC arbitral tribunals conducted their affairs in a haphazard, 
immodest manner that the most basic integrity of the arbitral process is
 imperiled
. In 
Spouses David v. Construction Industry and Arbitration Commission
:




 We reiterate the rule that factual findings of construction 
arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on
 appeal, except when the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the 
award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there 
was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of 
them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to 
postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear
 evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of 
the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under section nine of 
Republic Act No. 876 and willfully refrained from disclosing such 
disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any
 party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded 
their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and 
definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.

 More recently, in 2019, 
Tondo Medical Center v. Rante
[34]
 again cited

 Thus, questions on whether the CIAC arbitral tribunals conducted
 their affairs in a haphazard and immodest manner that the most basic 
integrity of the arbitral process was imperiled are not insulated from 
judicial review. Thus: 




 x x x We reiterate the rule that factual findings of 
construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by 
this Court on appeal, except when the petitioner proves affirmatively 
that: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue 
means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators
 or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in

 a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to
 them was not made.
[35]
 (Citations omitted) 






 Thus, there may still be factual review of findings made by CIAC 
arbitral tribunals, but only under very narrow grounds relating to the 
integrity of the arbitral tribunal. 
 Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of
 Civil Procedure enables the correction of actions in excess of 
jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion by bodies or officers 
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Rule 65 is a means of 
operationalizing the constitutionally-enshrined, inalienable dimension 
of judicial power "to determine whether or not there has been a grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the 
part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."
[36]
 

 Since the CIAC is a "quasi-judicial, administrative agency equipped 
with technical proficiency that enables it to efficiently and promptly 
resolve conflicts[,]"
[37]
 a petition for certiorari should rightly be available as a means of redress from the CIAC. 

 However, the availability of petitions for certiorari as a remedy does 
not stand by its lonesome. The possibility of relief through such 
modality must be viewed through the lens of how arbitration under the 
CIAC exists within the larger, general framework of arbitration put in 
place, initially by Republic Act No. 876 (the ADR Law), and eventually 
by Republic Act No. 9285 (the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 
2004). 
 To recall, 
CE Construction
 explained how 
"[a]rbitration of construction disputes through the CIAC was formally 
incorporated into the general statutory framework on alternative dispute
 resolution through [Sections 34 and 35 of] Republic Act No. 9285[.]"
[38]

 Even prior to Republic Act No. 9285, Republic Act No. 9184 (the 
Government Procurement Reform Act) referenced Republic Act No. 876 in 
affirming and delineating the competence of the CIAC. 
 It is with
 this lens that acknowledges the delimiting statutory framework of 
Republic Act No. 876 and Republic Act No. 9285 that jurisprudence has 
maintained that "factual findings of construction arbitrators are final 
and conclusive and not reviewable"
[39]
 except "in [those] instances when the integrity of the arbitral tribunal itself has been put in jeopardy."
[40]
 
Spouses David 
identifies five prototypical instances when an arbitral tribunal's award have been put in jeopardy: 
  


 (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue 
means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators
 or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in 
refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in 
refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4)
 one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under 
section nine of Republic Act No. 876 and wilfully refrained from 
disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which 
the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the 
arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that
 a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to
 them was not made.
[41]
 




 In view of these, I join the 
ponencia
 in maintaining that 
the CIAC's findings of fact may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals on 
certiorari, that is, on grave abuse of discretion. However, in the 
unique context of reviewing CIAC arbitral tribunal awards, a calibrated 
understanding of grave abuse of discretion must govern, that is, the 
very narrow grounds that go into the integrity of the CIAC arbitral 
tribunal, and, in addition, outright violations of the Constitution or 
laws. 
 To be clear, this calibrated understanding of grave abuse 
of discretion in the specific context of review via certiorari of CIAC 
arbitral tribunal awards 
does not
 undermine the integrity of the 
remedy of certiorari. The remedial vehicle of a petition for certiorari 
under Rule 65 was created by this Court pursuant, in particular, to its 
rule-making power under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the 1987 
Constitution. This power to "[p]romulgate rules concerning. . . 
pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts" proceeds from judicial 
power in general. 
 Judicial power pertains to our capacity to 
authoritatively read and interpret laws. Rule 65, then, is an expression
 of this Court's interpretative authority, one that is applicable to 
general circumstances involving grave abuse of discretion. In 
appropriate situations, such an expression may be refined or adjusted, 
given this Court's peculiar appreciation of facts and laws. This 
calibration of grave abuse of discretion and the availability of 
certiorari vis-a-vis CIAC arbitral awards (which I join the ponencia in 
advancing) is one such situation of a proper refinement or adjustment of
 how a procedural rule, i.e., Rule 65, previously laid out by this Court
 should apply.
 Beyond the narrow grounds for review on certiorari
 (i.e., grounds that go into the integrity of the CIAC arbitral 
tribunal, or outright violations of the Constitution or laws), rulings 
of the CIAC may be reviewed only by this Court on purely legal questions
 raised through petitions for review on certiorari. As the
 ponencia 
explains: 
  


 A harmonization of these conflicting rules leaves the Court with
 the conclusion that the inclusion of CIAC under Rule 43 appeals is 
without footing in the legal history of CIAC, and therefore must be 
unequivocally reversed. 


 More specifically, the Court holds that the direct recourse of 
an appeal of a CIAC award on questions of law directly to this Court is 
the rule, pursuant to E.O 1008 and R.A. 9285, notwithstanding Rule 43 on
 CA's jurisdiction over quasi-judicial agencies, and Rule 45 in its 
exclusive application to lower courts. Thus, an appeal from an arbitral 
award of CIAC may take either of two tracks, as determined by the 
subject matter of the challenge. 


 On the one hand, if the parties seek to challenge a finding of 
law of the tribunal, then the same may be appealed only to the Supreme 
Court under Rule 45. To determine whether or not a question is one of 
law which may be brought before the Court under Rule 45, it is useful to
 recall that a question of a question of law involves a doubt or 
controversy as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, as 
opposed to a question of fact which involves a doubt or difference that 
arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts, or when the query 
necessarily calls for a review and reevaluation of the whole evidence, 
including the credibility of witnesses, existence of specific 
surrounding circumstances, and the decided probabilities of the 
situation. The test here is not the party's characterization of the 
question before the court, but whether the court may resolve the issue 
brought to it by solely inquiring as to whether the law was properly 
applied and without going into a review of the evidence. 


 On the other hand, if the parties seek to challenge CIAC's 
finding of fact, the same may only be allowed under either of two 
premises, namely assailing the very integrity of the composition of the 
tribunal, or alleging the arbitral tribunal's violation of the 
Constitution or positive law, in which cases the appeal may be filed 
before the CA on these limited grounds through the special civil action 
of a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, in accordance with Section 4
 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure: 


 . . . .


 The resort to Rule 65, instead of Rule 43, further finds support
 in the very nature of the factual circumstances which trigger said 
exceptional factual review â those that center not on the actual 
findings of fact but on the integrity of the tribunal that makes these 
findings, or their compliance with the Constitution or positive law, 
i.e., any of the following factual allegations: (1) the award was 
procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was 
evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; 
(3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear 
evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of 
the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under  Section nine of 
Republic Act No. 876 or the Arbitration Law (R.A. 876), and willfully 
refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other 
misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially 
prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so 
imperfectly executed them, that a mutual , final and definite award upon
 the subject matter submitted to them was not made.
[42]




 The approach outlined by the
 ponencia
 is consistent with 
the primacy accorded to arbitral awards, fundamentally, because of 
arbitration's nature as a dispute resolution mechanism animated by the 
parties' free and voluntary intent to engage an arbitrator's expertise 
free from the rigidities of the conventional court system. "Arbitration 
is a creature of contract[,]"
[43]
 devised precisely to be free of the restraints of litigating in court. This makes it both economically efficient and equitable.

 As a creature of contract, arbitration internalizes and limits the cost
 of dispute resolution between the parties. It is equitable in that, it 
will free the dockets of courts (which, through taxpayers money is a 
subsidized means of dispute resolution) enabling them to devote more 
time, energy, and resources to those conflicts with a more pronounced 
public interest, such as those where power relations suffer from a 
greater deficit (e.g., rape and sexual abuse, labor disputes, cases 
raising questions of social justice, and skewed commercial relations 
such as consumer grievances), public interest cases (such as those 
raising constitutional issues), and matters of social order (e.g., 
criminal cases). 
 The understanding of arbitration as a creature 
of contract facilitating the parties' realization of their private ends 
has particularly ripened in international commercial arbitration: 
  


 In international law, the basic theory of arbitration is simple 
and rather elegant. Arbitral jurisdiction is entirely consensual. As in 
Roman law and the systems influenced by it, arbitration is a creature of
 contract. The arbitrator's powers are derived from the parties' 
contract. Hence, in the classic sense, an arbitrator is not entitled to 
do anything unauthorized by the parties: 
arbiter nihil extra compromissum facere potest
.
 An arbitral award rendered within the framework of the common agreement
 of the parties is itself part of the contract and hence binding on 
them. Conversely, a purported award which is accomplished in ways 
inconsistent with the shared contractual expectations of the parties is 
something to which they had not agreed. The arbitrator has exceeded his 
power or, to use the technical term, committed an 
exces de pouvoir
. If the allegation of such an excess can be sustained, the putative award is null, and may be ignored by the "losing" party. 


 Arbitration is advantageous to parties because it gives them an 
additional contractual option for resolving disputes without engaging 
community structures. It is also advantageous to the community: it 
allows economical resolution of private disputes that are often 
diversions from productive activity, without more general disruption and
 without direct cost to the community. The doctrine of 
exces de pouvoir

 functions as an indispensable control mechanism in this scheme. Without
 it, arbitration would lose its character of restrictive delegation and 
the arbitrator would become a decision maker with virtually absolute 
discretion; whatever limits may have been prescribed by the parties 
would become meaningless because the arbitrator would be answerable 
effectively to no one.
 Exces de pouvoir 
thus is the conceptual foundation of control for arbitration.
[44]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Another author keenly discussed the particular utility of 
arbitration in commercial relationships. His discussion also explored 
how the "contractarian model" animated the United States' Federal 
Arbitration Act's pioneering delineation of the distinctly restrictive 
grounds for vacating arbitral awards. Quite notably, our own pioneering 
Arbitral Law, Republic Act No. 876, would adopt in its Section 24 
precisely the same restrictive grounds spelled out by the Federal 
Arbitration Act: 
  


 The contractarian model made sense when applied to commercial 
relationships because the merchants who employed it typically subscribed
 to a common set of business practices. When they had disputes, they 
wanted neutrals grounded in those practices to make decisions based on 
custom and mutual interest They did not want anyone, whether a genuine 
judge or a minor league one, to mechanically apply fixed legal rules. 


 With [Julius Henry] Cohen as its champion, the American Bar 
Association's Committee on Commerce, Trade, and Commercial Law succeeded
 in pushing the [Federal Arbitration Act) through Congress. The [Federal
 Arbitration Act] ... seems clearly to assume a role for the arbitrator 
consistent with the contractarian model. That perspective comes through 
in the provisions for judicial review of awards. Section 10 of the 
[Federal Arbitration Act] contains a list of four grounds for vacating 
arbitral awards: 








(1)


[W]here the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;






(2)


 
[W]here there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; 






(3)


 
[W]here the arbitrators were guilty 
of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause
 shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the 
controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any 
party have been prejudiced; or 






(4)


 
[W]here the arbitrators exceeded 
their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and 
definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
[45]
 (Citations omitted) 










It would be regressive, both for contracting parties in arbitration
 and to society in general, for this Court to insist on expansive 
judicial review of arbitral awards. Unduly expansive judicial review 
undermines an otherwise effective, self-contained mechanism for dispute 
resolution. Any form of conflict resolution will see the losing party 
dissatisfied. Yet it must, at some point, have a definite ending. 
Interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium
.
[46]

 The further continuation of otherwise settled conflicts, particularly 
for those which are distinctly private in character, must be pursued 
only when there are compelling, ineluctable grounds. 


 When a private conflict may otherwise be put to rest by the 
mechanism specifically devised by the parties for it, it is a disservice
 to the larger community to compel a court to have that conflict be an 
exclusionary object of its attention. This is what it means to not 
disturb arbitral awards, lest the integrity of the arbitral tribunal 
itself be compromised. As, when an arbitral tribunal is wanting in 
integrity, what are committed are not mere mistakes by erstwhile 
experts, but a definite offense against fairness and truth; there is 
then a miscarriage of justice. 
  
 Ultimately, the
 ponencia 
is correct in concluding that 
the "[Court of Appeals] misapplied its appellate function when it delved
 into settling the factual matters, and modified the mathematical 
computation of the CIAC with respect to the presence or absence of an 
outstanding balance payable to [Ross Systems International, Inc.]"
[47]

 It being error for the Court of Appeals to abandon the CIAC arbitral 
tribunal's award, the assailed Court of Appeals Decision must be 
reversed, and the arbitral tribunal's award reinstated. 
  
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote that the Petition subject of G.R. No. 230112 be 
PARTIALLY GRANTED 
and
 the assailed October 28, 2016 Decision of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 145753 be reversed with respect to Ross Systems 
International, Inc.'s entitlement to P1,088,214.83. The May 10, 2016 
Final Award of the arbitral tribunal of the Construction Industry 
Arbitration Commission must be reinstated subject to the need for 
petitioner Global Medical Center of Laguna, Inc. to furnish respondent 
Ross Systems International, Inc. the pertinent BIR Form 2307.

 Republic Act No. 876 (1953), sec. 24 states:




 Section 24. Grounds for vacating award. - In any one of the 
following cases, the court must make an order vacating the award upon 
the petition of any party to the controversy when such party proves 
affirmatively that in the arbitration proceedings:


  (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud , or other undue means; or
 
    (b) That there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or 

    (c) That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to 
postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear
 evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; that one or more of
 the arbitrators was disqualified to act as such under section nine 
hereof, and wilfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or
 of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been 
materially prejudiced; or 

    (d) That the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly 
executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject 
matter submitted to them was not made.


 Where an award is vacated, the court, in its discretion, may 
direct a new hearing either before the same arbitrators or before a new 
arbitrator or arbitrators to be chosen in the manner provided in the 
submission or contract for the selection of the original arbitrator or 
arbitrators, and any provision limiting the time in which the 
arbitrators may make a decision shall be deemed applicable to the new 
arbitration and to commence from the date of the court's order. 


 Where the court vacates an award, costs, not exceeding fifty 
pesos and disbursements may be awarded to the prevailing party and the 
payment thereof may be enforced in like manner as the payment of costs 
upon the motion in an action.

CONCURRING 	AND DISSENTING	OPINION


 
LAZARO-JAVIER, 
J
.:
Essentially, the 
Majority
 would like to give true force and
 effect to the legislature's express intent on how and under what 
grounds the review of domestic arbitral awards should be 
operationalized. The 
Majority
 pushes for Rule 45, instead of Rule 43, as the prescribed mode of review for construction arbitration cases. In so doing, the 
Ponencia
 rejects the following:
  


 
First
, the present iteration of Rule 43 stating 
that a petition for review "shall apply to appeals from awards, 
judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any 
quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. 
Among these agencies (is) the ... Construction Industry Arbitration 
Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law."
[1]


 
Second
, the consistent and long-standing 
recognition by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, the 
litigants, and even by this Court that it is the Court of Appeals, no 
other, which has appellate jurisdiction over CIAC's dispositions 
(through its panel of arbitrators) in construction arbitration cases 
ever since Republic Act No. (RA) 7902
[2]
 took effect in 1995.
[3]


 
Third
, all our decisions
[4]

 under Rule 45 where we took cognizance of and resolved petitions 
emanating from the Rule 43 appellate dispositions of the Court of 
Appeals in CIAC cases brought before it. We ourselves have never before 
impugned such vesture of jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals. Far from 
it, we have, for the longest time, explicitly and consistently 
recognized this jurisdiction 
via
 our present iteration of Rule 43. 


 
Fourth
, the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration
[5]
 which took effect on December 15, 2005. Section 18
[6]

 of the rules similarly echoes the vesture of appellate jurisdiction in 
the Court of Appeals over construction arbitration cases 
via
 Rule
 43. CIAC is the agency tasked by law to implement the CIAC Law, hence, 
its interpretation of the law, as borne in the rules, deserves the 
Court's highest respect. 




 With due respect, however, the Majority appears to have 
conflated
 the 
vacatur
 and the 
modification or correction
 mechanisms in RA 876
[7]
 and RA 9285
[8]
 and the 
Revised CIAC Rules
 with the 
appeal
 process also provided for and delineated in the same laws. If the Court should abide by legislative intent, there is 
nothing clearer and more explicit
 than the 
distinctions
 between the 
vacatur
 and the 
modification or correction
 mechanisms and the
 appeal
 process in the relevant statutes and implementing rules themselves. 
 The 
vacatur
 and 
correction mechanisms
 referred by the
 Majority
, 
including 
the allegedly 
exclusive grounds to be invoked
 for the 
same
, all refer to the 
proceedings
 at the 
Regional Trial Court
 and 
not the appeal/review proceedings
 at the 
Court of Appeals
. It is therefore a 
leap in logic to restrict
 the appeal/review proceedings in the Court of Appeals 
solely
 to the grounds for vacating or correcting an arbitral award by a Regional Trial Court. 
 The 
"integrity-centered" grounds
[9]
 referred to by the 
Majority
 
does not pertain to the appeal/review of the Court of Appeals
 but to the 
vacatur
 and 
modification
 proceedings before the Regional Trial Court. 
On one hand
, RA 876
[10]
 allows the Court of Appeals to entertain 
questions of law
 in the appeal/review; on the other, RA 9285
[11]
 is open-ended as regards the questions that may be raised in the appeal/review process. 
 
To be sure
, under both RA 876 and RA 9285, an appeal to the Court of Appeals is 
from an order or decision
 rendered by the 
Regional Trial Court
 in 
confirming
, vacating, or correcting an arbitral award or otherwise. The appeal/review of the Court of Appeals is
 not
 from the arbitral award itself. This should 
thus explain
 Rule 19.7
[12]
 of the 
Special ADR Rules
 that "[c]onsequently, a party to an arbitration is 
precluded
 from
 filing
 an appeal or a 
petition for 
certiorari
 questioning
 the merits of an 
arbitral award
." 
  
 
However
, Section 40 of RA 9285
[13]
 provides that "[a] 
CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the Regional Trial Court
 to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008." Hence, there 
will be no order or decision
 from the 
Regional Trial Court
 that may be 
appealed to
 or 
reviewed by the Court of Appeals
,
 unless
 one of the parties 
moved to vacate or correct
 a
 CIAC
 arbitral award before the Regional Trial Court. 
  
 Notably, a 
CIAC 
arbitral award itself is 
NOT immune from appeal/review
 by the Court of Appeals. A party to an arbitration DOES NOT also have to 
first
 seek to vacate or correct the arbitral award 
before
 it may be appealed to and reviewed by the Court of Appeals. 
  
 The 
Majority
 nonetheless posits that RA 9285 has re-enacted the appeal procedure under the 
original version
 of Section 19 of Executive Order No. (EO) 1008
[14]
 so that the appeal is
 now back

 to this Court from the Court of Appeals on questions of law and the 
appeal procedure will already be under Rule 45, Rules of Court, by
 certiorari
.
[15]


 Section 19
[16]
 of EO
 1008 (circa 1985), however, cannot be deemed to have been reenacted 
into RA 9285 (circa 2004). Section 19 states that the arbitral award 
shall be final and inappealable except on questions of law which shall 
be brought to the Supreme Court. 
 While it is true that Section 
34 of RA 9285 states that the arbitration of construction disputes shall
 be governed by EO 1008, this refers only to the 
arbitration proceedings proper before the CIAC, not thereafter
.
 This is clear from the entirety of CHAPTER 6 entitled ARBITRATION OF 
CONSTRUCTION DISPUTES of RA 9285 which includes Sections 34 to 39, 
viz
.: 
  
 
CHAPTER 6
 
  Arbitration of Construction Disputes




 
SECTION 34.
 
Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law
.
 â The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by 
Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry 
Arbitration Law. 


 
SECTION 35.
 
Coverage of the Law
. â 
Construction disputes which fall within the original and exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (the 
"Commission") shall include those between or among parties to, or who 
are otherwise bound by, an arbitration agreement, directly or by 
reference whether such parties are project owner, contractor, 
subcontractor, fabricator, project manager, design professional, 
consultant, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer of an insurance policy
 in a construction project. 


 The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive
 jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is 
"commercial" pursuant to Section 21 of this Act. 


 
SECTION 36. 
Authority to Act as Mediator or Arbitrator
.
 â By written agreement of the parties to a dispute, an arbitrator may 
act as mediator and a mediator may act as arbitrator. The parties may 
also agree in writing that, following a successful mediation, the 
mediator shall issue the settlement agreement in the form of an arbitral
 award. 


 
SECTION 37. 
Appointment of Foreign Arbitrator
.
 â The Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) shall 
promulgate rules to allow for the appointment of a foreign arbitrator as
 co-arbitrator or chairman of a tribunal a person who has not been 
previously accredited by CIAC: Provided, That: 


 (a) the dispute is a construction dispute in which one party is an international party; 


 (b) the person to be appointed agreed to abide by the arbitration rules and policies of CIAC; 


 (c) he/she is either co-arbitrator upon the nomination of the 
international party; or he/she is the common  choice of the two 
CIAC-accredited arbitrators first appointed, one "of whom was nominated 
by the international party; and


 (d) the foreign arbitrator shall be of different nationality from the international party. 


 
SECTION 38. 
Applicability to Construction Arbitration
.
 â The provisions of Section 17(d) of Chapter 2, and Sections 28 and 29 
of this Act shall apply to arbitration of construction disputes covered 
by this Chapter. 


 
SECTION 39.
 
Court to Dismiss Case Involving a Construction Dispute
.
 â A Regional Trial Court before which a construction dispute is filed 
shall, upon becoming aware, not later than the pre-trial conference, 
that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement, dismiss the 
case and refer the parties to arbitration to be conducted by the CIAC, 
unless both parties, assisted by their respective counsel, shall submit 
to the Regional Trial Court a written agreement exclusively for the 
Court, rather than the CIAC, to resolve the dispute.
[17]
 




The fact that Section 34 is grouped together with the provisions 
governing the construction disputes within the jurisdiction of CIAC, the
 manner by which the parties may choose the arbitrator or mediator who 
will resolve their dispute, the requisites for appointment of foreign 
arbitrator, the adoption of certain provisions of RA 9285, specifically 
Section 17,
[18]
 Chapter 2 on the enforcement of mediated settlement agreement and Sections 28
[19]
 and 29,
[20]
 Chapter 3 on the grant of interim measure of protection pending arbitration before the CIAC, means that Section 34
[21]

 in fact refers only to the adoption of EO 1008 governing the 
arbitration proceedings before the CIAC and not thereafter when judicial
 remedies already come into play. 
  
 Indeed, after an award or judgment is rendered at the CIAC 
level, the arbitration process should be deemed to have ended too. Thus,
 when this award or judgment, 
etc.
 is challenged in court, the adversarial judicial process begins, not 
via
 Rule 45 as supposedly prescribed by Section 19 of EO 1008, but
 via

 Rule 43 and before the Court of Appeals as validly decreed under RA 
7902 which is deemed to have long amended Section 19 of EO 1008. 
  
 Admittedly, we have the Special Rules of Court on Alternative 
Dispute Resolution, Rule 19.7 which read: "â¦ a party to an arbitration 
is precluded from filing an appeal or a petition for 
certiorari

 questioning the merits of an arbitral tribunal." But these rules should
 not be construed to repeal a statute enacted by Congress, such as RA 
7902, which the Court is conclusively presumed to have known of when it 
promulgated these Special Rules. Notably, even after the promulgation of
 the Special Rules in 2009, we did not amend Rule 43. In fact, even in 
2019 when we revised our Rules on Civil Procedure, we did not amend Rule
 43 insofar as CIAC cases are concerned. We simply continued to 
recognize the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over the dispositions
 of CIAC
 via
 Rule 43 pursuant to RA 7902. If at all, Rule 19.7 
should be construed as applying only to the process of alternative 
dispute resolution before arbitration tribunals other than CIAC which is
 already specifically governed by Rule 43. 
  
 In any event, if the 
Majority
 is correct, that Rule 19.7 should be understood to be absolute and literal, then even the prescribed remedy by the 
Ponencia
, a Rule 45 petition to this Court, would also have been prohibited. 
  
 More important, RA 9285 took effect in 2004, hence, it is governed by the 1987 Constitution. Section 30, Art. VI
[22]

 of the 1987 Constitution provides that "no law shall be passed 
increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided 
in this Constitution without its advice and consent." On the basis of 
this provision, therefore, the alleged vesture under the so-called 
reenacted Section 19 of EO 1008 of "exclusive appellate jurisdiction in 
the Supreme Court" over CIAC awards, judgments, etc., without its advice
 and consent, is 
unconstitutional
. This must be the 
reason why despite the effectivity of EO 1008 and its so-called 
reenactment into RA 9285, the iteration of Rule 43 since 1997 remains 
the same to this very date, that is, the jurisdiction of the Court of 
Appeals over CIAC awards, 
etc.
 remains vested in the Court of Appeals
 via
 a petition for review. Clearly, in promulgating Rule 43, the Supreme Court has applied RA 7902,
[23]
 and never Section 19 of EO 1008 whether in its original text or as purportedly reenacted.
  
 Further, note the specific provisions in Chapter 7 of RA 9285 on 
judicial review
. If the intention of Section 34 
were
 to adopt 
in toto
 EO 1008 (specifically Section 19) and not only the provisions with respect to the 
voluntary
 dispute resolution of 
arbitration
, RA 9285 
would not have
 enacted Chapter 7 and 
would not have
 provided specific provisions on 
judicial review
 by the Regional Trial Court, 
viz
.: 
  


 A. DOMESTIC AWARDS


 
SECTION 40.
 Confirmation of Award
. â The confirmation of a domestic arbitral award shall be governed by Section 23 of R.A. No. 876. 


 A domestic arbitral award when confirmed shall be enforced in 
the same manner as final and executory decisions of the Regional Trial 
Court. 


 The recognition and enforcement of an award in an international 
commercial arbitration shall be governed by Article 35 of the Model Law.
 


 The confirmation of a domestic award shall be made by the 
Regional Trial Court in accordance with the Rules of Procedure to be 
promulgated by the Supreme Court. 


 A CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the Regional Trial Court to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008.
[24]
 




 Too, if Section 34 of RA 9285 
were all encompassing
, there 
would have been no need for Congress
 to enact the last paragraph of Section 40 of RA 9285, 
viz
.: 
  


 The confirmation of a domestic award shall be made by the 
Regional Trial Court in accordance with the Rules of Procedure to be 
promulgated by the Supreme Court. 


 A CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the Regional Trial Court to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008.
[25]




 Further,
 note that 
Section 40 is actually a 
mere reiteration
 of Section 20 of EO 1008, 
viz
.: 
  


 
SECTION 20.
 
Execution and Enforcement of Awards
.
 â As soon as a decision, order or award has become final and executory,
 the Arbitral Tribunal or the single arbitrator with the occurrence of 
the CIAC shall motu proprio, or on motion of any interested party, issue
 a writ of execution requiring any sheriff or other proper officer to 
execute said decision, order or award.
[26]
 




 
Yet
, Congress 
still included

 this portion of Section 40 in RA 9285. This shows even more that the 
adoption of EO 1008 into RA 9285 applies only to the provisions 
pertaining to the arbitration proceeding proper before the CIAC and does
 not include the adoption of the provisions on judicial remedies. 
  
 If truly the intent of Section 34 were truly what the 
Majority
 asserts it to be, Section 40 would have been an 
unnecessary provision
. But Congress 
could not have
 enacted a 
useless provision
. The fact that the last paragraph of Section 40 was enacted 
only means
 that Section 34 is 
not all encompassing
 as the 
Ponencia
 says it is. 
  
 I cannot subscribe to the position of the 
Majority
 
that since Section 19 of EO 1008 originally took effect in 1985 under 
the 1973 Constitution where advice and consent of the Supreme Court was 
not yet required,
[27]
 its reenactment into RA 9285, 
albeit

 the same took effect under the new Constitution, remains exempt from 
complying with the consent and advice requirement. Surely, every 
provision of law even that which has been simply reenacted, is, in the 
eyes of the Constitution, a new provision altogether. As such, it must 
comply with the requirements of the Constitution effective at the time 
it is passed and becomes effective. It is absurd to say that most of the
 provisions of RA 9285 are governed by the 1987 Constitution while one 
stand out provision remains governed by the 1973 Constitution. 
  
 At any rate, in promulgating every single provision in the 
Rules of Court, the Highest Court of the land is conclusively presumed 
to know all the relevant existing laws and it will never promulgate 
rules contrary thereto. To repeat, the claim that the appeal 
jurisdiction over CIAC arbitral awards has reverted back to the Supreme 
Court pursuant to Section 34 of RA 9285, specifically pertaining to 
Section 19 of EO 1008, has no legal basis, nay, unconstitutional. The 
appellate jurisdiction over CIAC arbitral awards is still with the Court
 of Appeals and the appellate procedure for this purpose is still under 
Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. 
 As for the grounds upon which the
 appeal to the Court of Appeals is made, the same cannot be restricted 
to the grounds impacting on the arbitral tribunal's integrity. RA 7902 
provides questions of law as the ground for appeal. These are not 
limited to issues about the integrity of the arbitral tribunal. 
Questions of law include whether on the basis of the facts on record, 
the standard of proof has been satisfied. They assume the credibility 
and reliability of the factual findings of the arbitral tribunal but 
ask: 
Did the claimant prove its case according to the standard of proof demanded by the case?
 

 Going now to Rule 65, the same is always available where there is grave
 abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction and 
there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, or adequate remedy available in
 the ordinary course of law. But even though appeal may be available, 
Rule 65 may still be resorted to if appeal is not a plain speedy or 
adequate remedy to the aggrieved party under the circumstances. There is
 no question that Rule 65 is the appropriate remedy where the CIAC acted
 with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to excess or lack of 
jurisdiction. I agree with Senior Associate Justice Estela 
Perlas-Bernabe that this ground cannot be altered or narrowed down by 
the Court into just: 
  


 The resort to Rule 65, instead of Rule 43, further finds support
 in the very nature of the factual circumstances which trigger said 
exceptional factual reviewâthose that center not on the actual findings 
of fact but on the integrity of the tribunal that makes these findings, 
or their compliance with the Constitution or positive law,
 i.e.
,
 any of the following factual allegations: (1) the award was procured by
 corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident 
partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the 
arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence 
pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the 
arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under Section 9 of R.A. 
876, and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or 
of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been 
materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or 
so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award 
upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.
[28]
 




 This is discriminatory, hence, 
violative of the equal protection clause
. 
  
 In any case, the Court cannot rule that Rule 65, and 
exclusively on such limited grounds, is the only remedy available at the
 Court of Appeals. To emphasize, this pronouncement is contrary to RA 
7902 which defines the remedy as an appeal and the ground as questions 
of law. In the exercise of its rule making power, the Court had, over 
two (2) decades ago, identified the procedure of this appeal as falling 
under Rule 43. This  determination by the 	t is of course correct. The 
remedy cannot be under Rule 65 because it is not an appeal procedure. 
 Finally, because the 
Majority

 pushes for the abandonment of our nearly 24-year-old Rule 43 and the 
countless cases we resolved upholding it, there is also the consequent 
abandonment of the present CIAC Rules, 
albeit
 CIAC is not before us and has not been heard
. Most of all, the issue whether we should revise Rule 43 and, thus, prescribe a new mode of review is being 
motu proprio

 advocated, in violation of the Court's strict procedure in revising the
 provisions of the Rules of Court. Included in this procedure are the 
creation of a corresponding sub-committee to undertake the study of the 
proposed amendment and the invitation to the stakeholders to participate
 and be heard in the process, among others. The amendment of Rule 43, 
with all its serious repercussions, cannot be done hastily here and now,
 nay, sharply departing from our prescribed rules on amendments. More so
 because the appeal or review procedure we now seek to overhaul is not 
even the subject of the present cases before us now. Thus, the parties 
are absolutely unaware of this issue and consequently have not been 
heard thereon. 
  
 Lastly, I respectfully 
stress
 the Court's efforts to 
empower
 our lower courts, especially the third level appellate courts, by 
decentralizing
 the appeal/review process and 
entrusting
 them with
 greater
 than the usual 
adjudicative jurisdiction
 and 
responsibility for the decisions
 they make. This advocacy
 has also helped
 the Court to 
focus
 its attention to some extent only to 
cases of transcendental importance and impact
. I respectfully submit that the 
Majority
 goes 
against
 this tide of 
adjudicative empowerment
 and 
proper case focus and management
. Allowing the Court of Appeals to take cognizance of the appeal/review from a CIAC Decision 
under Rule 43
 as there is 
no other procedure
, is more in keeping with the time-honored rule that the 
transfer of appeals by the Court to subordinate appellate courts is purely a procedural and not a substantive power
.
[29]


 When the Court resolves to transfer an appeal to a lower court, it only has in mind 
practicality
 and 
efficiency
. Procedural amendments are always aimed to 
upgrade the Court's efficiency
 by 
maxing up the Court of Appeals' capability
 before they finally reach the Court. It is actually a 
filtering mechanism
 adopted by the Court so that by the time a case reaches the Court, the 
relevant issues

 have already been laid straight and the Court can now be true to its 
mandate of resolving only issues of transcendental importance and 
impact. Again, this is to enable the Court to devote its precious time 
and effort to cases with more pressing issues. 
  
 Here, there are 
no strong
 and
 justifiable reasons
 to 
overhaul
 jurisprudence that upholds the
 jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals 
over appeals/review from 
CIAC arbitral awards
 and to 
reject Rule 43 of the 
Rules of Court
 as the 
governing procedure
 for this purpose. Maintaining the 
status quo 
would 
acknowledge
 not only the
 competence and expertise of arbitrators
 and the 
generally
 final nature of their orders and decisions but also the importance to 
us of ensuring ample protection for the rights of the parties
. 
  
 On the 
merits
, I 
humbly agree
 with the 
Majority
 that the Court of Appeals erred in awarding RSII the amount of Php1,088,214.83. The decision of the arbitrators
 denying RSII
 any claim under Progress Billing No. 15 is 
based on substantial evidence
. Hence, the Court of Appeals
 erred

 in modifying the arbitrators' decision on this aspect. GMCLI should 
furnish RSII with the pertinent BIR Form 2307. This is pursuant to a
 straightforward application

 of Section 2.57.3 of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98. As applied here, this
 Revenue Regulation should have already called for GMCLI to remit the 2%
 CWT as soon as each Progress Billing was paid and to issue the 
corresponding BIR Form 2307 to RSII in order for the latter to have had a
 tax credit claim on the same. 
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote to 
PARTIALLY REVERSE

 the Decision dated October 28, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. 
SP No. 145753 with respect to the entitlement of RSII to the amount of 
P1,088,214.83, and to 
REINSTATE with MODIFICATION
, the Arbitrators' Decision dated May 10, 2016. GMCLI should be 
ORDERED
 to furnish RSII with BIR Form 2307. 
 However,

 I maintain my position that the appellate jurisdiction over CIAC 
arbitral awards is still with the Court of Appeals and the appellate 
procedure for this purpose is still under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.

 As is apparent in the two grounds that trigger the exceptional factual review of CIAC arbitral awards,
 i.e.
,
 those that pertain to either the lack of integrity or the imputed 
unconstitutionality or illegality of the arbitrators or the arbitral 
process, the contracted grounds are tight enough , but nevertheless 
embrace and preserve the courts' power to re-examine factual findings of
 a CIAC arbitral tribunal, precisely when the latter's lack of 
integrity, or its unconstitutional or illegal actions taint the same.

RULE 19.7.
 
No Appeal or Certiorari on the Merits of an Arbitral Award.
 â An agreement to refer a dispute to arbitration shall mean that the arbitral award shall be final and binding. 

  Consequently, a party to an arbitration is precluded from filing an 
appeal or a petition for certiorari questioning the merits of an 
arbitral award. (Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute 
Resolution, A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC, September 1, 2009).

 SECTION 40. 
Confirmation of Award.
 â The confirmation of a domestic arbitral award shall be governed by Section 23 of R.A. No. 876. 

  A domestic arbitral award when confirmed shall be enforced in the same
 manner as final and executory decisions of the Regional Trial Court.

 
  The recognition and enforcement of an award in an international 
commercial arbitration shall be governed by Article 35 of the Model Law.

SECTION 17.
 
Enforcement of Mediated Settlement Agreements.
 â The mediation shall be guided by the following operative principles: 




(a) A settlement agreement following successful mediation shall 
be prepared by the parties with the assistance of their respective 
counsel, if any, and by the mediator. The parties and their respective 
counsels shall endeavor to make the terms and condition thereof complete
 and make adequate provisions for the contingency of breach to avoid 
conflicting interpretations of the agreement. 

    (b) The parties and their respective counsels, if any, shall sign 
the settlement agreement. The mediator shall certify that he/she 
explained the contents of the settlement agreement to the parties in 
language known to them. 

    (c) If the parties so desire, they may deposit such settlement 
agreement with the appropriate Clerk of a Regional Trial Court of the 
place where one of the parties resides. Where there is a need to enforce
 the settlement agreement, a petition may be filed by any of the parties
 with the same court, in which case, the court shall proceed summarily 
to hear the petition, in accordance with such rules of procedure as may 
be promulgated by the Supreme Court.
 
    (d) The parties may agree in the settlement agreement that the 
mediator shall become a sole arbitrator for the dispute and shall treat 
the settlement agreement as an arbitral award which shall be subject to 
enforcement under Republic Act No. 876, otherwise known as the 
Arbitration Law, notwithstanding the provision of Executive Order No. 
1008 for mediated disputes outside of the CIA C. (Alternative Dispute 
Resolution Act of 2004, Republic Act No. 9285, April 2, 2004)




[19]
 SECTION 28.
 
Grant of Interim Measure of Protection
.
 â (a) It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party 
to request, before constitution of the tribunal, from a Court an interim
 measure of protection and for the Court to grant such measure. After 
constitution of the arbitral tribunal and during arbitral proceedings, a
 request for an interim measure of protection, or modification thereof, 
may be made with the arbitral tribunal or to the extent that the 
arbitral tribunal has no power to act or is unable to act effectively, 
the request may be made with the Court. The arbitral tribunal is deemed 
constituted when the sole arbitrator or the third arbitrator, who has 
been nominated, has accepted the nomination and written communication of
 said nomination and acceptance has been received by the party making 
the request. 








(b)


The following rules on interim or provisional relief shall be observed: 








(1)


Any party may request that provisional relief be granted against the adverse party.








(2)


 
Such relief may be granted:










(i)


 
to prevent irreparable loss or injury;










(ii)


to provide security for the performance of any obligation; 










(iii)


 
to produce or preserve any evidence; or










(iv)


 
to compel any other appropriate act or omission.








(3)


 
The order granting 
provisional relief may be conditioned upon the provision of security or 
any act or omission specified in the order.








(4)


 
Interim or provisional 
relief is requested by written application transmitted by reasonable 
means to the Court or arbitral tribunal as the case may be and the party
 against whom the relief is sought, describing in appropriate detail the
 precise relief, the party against whom the relief is requested, the 
grounds for the relief, and the evidence supporting the request. 








(5)


 
The order shall be binding upon by the parties. 








(6)


 
Either party may apply 
with the Court for assistance in implementing or enforcing an interim 
measure ordered by an arbitral tribunal. 








(7)


A party who does not comply
 with the order shall be liable for all damages resulting from 
noncompliance, including all expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, 
paid in obtaining the order's judicial enforcement. (Alternative Dispute
 Resolution Act of 2004, Republic Act No. 9285, April 2, 2004)








[20]
 
SECTION 29.
 
Further Authority for Arbitrator to Grant Interim Measure of Protection
.
 â Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at
 the request of a party, order any party to take such interim measures 
of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect
 of the subject-matter of the dispute following the rules in Section 28,
 paragraph 2. Such interim measures may include but shall not be limited
 to preliminary injunction directed against a party, appointment of 
receivers or detention, preservation, inspection of property that is the
 subject of the dispute in arbitration. Either party may apply with the 
Court for assistance in implementing or enforcing an interim measure 
ordered by an arbitral tribunal. (Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 
2004, Republic Act No. 9285, April 2, 2004).  


 
[21]
 SECTION 34.
 
Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law
.
 â The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by 
Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry 
Arbitration Law. (Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, Republic 
Act No. 9285, April 2, 2004)

 law shall be passed increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the
