HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the February 19, 2013 Decision
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 95433, which denied petitioners' appeal on the February 26, 2010 Decision
[3]

 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Fernando City, La Union, 
Branch 28 in Civil Case No. 4557. The trial court dismissed herein 
petitioners' complaint for Quieting of Title with Damages against the 
respondents.


Factual Antecedents:



Josefina Quejado-Viloria, Remedios Quejado-Gaerlan (Remedios), Benjamin 
F. Quejado, Demetrio F. Quejado (Demetrio) and Felicitas F. Quejado 
filed before the trial court a complaint
[4]

 for Quieting of Title with Damages. They claimed ownership over a 
10,000-square meter lot located in Taboc, San Juan, La Union (subject 
property), having inherited the subject property from their 
predecessor-in-interest who had openly, publicly, continuously and 
peacefully possessed the same without interruption for more than 30 
years in the concept of an owner.
[5]



The Quejados alleged that the heirs of Segunda Gaetos, Pablo and Salome 
Gaetos and Justiniano Gaetos, and the children of Francisco Gaetos 
surreptitiously and without their knowledge and consent caused the 
subject property to be surveyed for the purpose of claiming ownership. 
Their acts disturbed and put a cloud on their ownership, possession, and
 title over the subject property. Efforts toward amicable settlement 
between parties were exerted before the barangay council but failed.
[6]



The Gaetos heirs denied the allegations of the heirs of Quejado. They 
insisted that the Quejados were not the owners of the subject property. 
They maintained that the Gaetos family owned the property in dispute by 
virtue of succession from a common ancestor several years before World 
War II. The subject property was later surveyed through cadastral survey
 of San Juan, La Union and partitioned as follows:
[7]


Lot No. 1429, with and area of 1,678 sq. m., Constantino 
Gaetos; Lot No. 1430, with an area of 1,112 sq.m., Juan Aman; Lot No. 
1431, with an area of 1,844 sq. m., Pablo Gaetos; and Lot No. 1432, with
 an area of 2,824 sq. m., Salome Gaetos
[8]



 






The heirs of Eudoxia Gaetos and Galiciano Gaetos, represented by Mildred
 Madayag, intervened in the case alleging that they were co-owners of 
the property in issue.
[9]



Trial ensued.



The Quejado heirs presented testimonial evidence pointing to their ownership and possession of the subject property.



Demetrio and Remedios testified that upon the demise of their parents, 
they took over the possession of the subject property which was 
surrounded as follows: North-Chan Family; South-Adelina Paredes; 
East-Segundo Gaetos; and West-China Sea. To fortify the veracity of 
their claim of ownership over the land, they also averred that their 
mother mortgaged the subject property on several occasions with various 
banks.
[10]



The testimonies of Eulogia Catbagan (Eulogia) and Vicente Laurea, Sr. 
(Vicente), a tenant and a neighbor, respectively, were also presented. 
They both acknowledged the ownership of the Quejados over the subject 
property. Eulogia attested its "sandy" state while Vicente claimed that 
his brother was a tenant of the subject property. Pieces of documentary 
evidence, like the mortgages and their cancellation and Tax Declaration 
Nos. 13457 and 15859 under the name of Demetrio and Remedios' mother, 
were presented to support their claim of ownership.
[11]



On the other hand, the heirs of Gaetos adduced the testimony of Isabelo 
Laurea (Isabelo), who testified that the subject property was near his 
place and its original owner was the grandfather of Francisco Gaetos. 
The first tenant of the subject property was Teodoro Laurea, his 
grandfather, who was succeeded by Cosme Laurea and then his father, 
Laureano Laurea. The tenancy was later passed on to Isabelo. The subject
 property was bounded as follows: NorthÂ­brother of Francisco Gaetos; 
South-daughter of Edis Agbunag; East-national road; West-sea. He also 
knew that the husband of Carmen Fernandez bought a land previously owned
 by Mariano Padua located in the east of the national road. Meanwhile, 
the house of Carmen Fernandez was located at a distance of 100 meters 
from his own place but not within the subject property.
[12]



Teresita Ganaden (Teresita), granddaughter of Francisco Gaetos, also 
testified. She recalled that the subject property was originally owned 
by Leon Gaetos and Praxedes Pascua, who had six children, namely: 
Eudoxia, Galiciano, Francisco, Francisca, Feliza, and Raymunda, who were
 already deceased when the case was instituted. She likewise presented 
the San Juan, La Union Cadastre Cad 739-D to show that the subject 
property was partitioned among the six children of Leon and Praxedes 
Gaetos. Eudoxia acquired the northern portion (Lot 1434); the middle 
portions were allotted to Galicano (Lot 1433); Francisco was given Lot 
1432; Feliza received Lot 1431; Raymunda had Lot 1430; and Francisca got
 the southern portion or Lot 1429. To bolster their claim, Teresita also
 presented receipts of expropriation payments for the properties ordered
 expropriated by the Court of First Instance of La Union, including the 
decision in the said case involving the subject property. The 
properties, as apportioned, were subsequently transferred to individual 
persons, as evidenced by current tax declarations in their names 
presented before the court.
[13]






Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:


 







After trial, the trial court rendered its February 26, 2010 Decision,
[14]
 finding no merit in the complaint of the Quejados. The dispositive portion of the judgment reads:


WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing premises, this court 
finds preponderance of evidence to be in favor of the defendants and 
judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint for Quieting of 
Title with Damages.


SO ORDERED.
[15]



The trial court found that the evidence of the Quejados did not 
convincingly establish that they possessed the property publicly, 
exclusively, and peacefully in the concept of owners. The trial court 
also noted that they did not have the requisite title to pursue an 
action for quieting of title.



Aggrieved, the heirs of Quejado assailed the trial court's judgment before the appellate court.


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:



The appellate court denied petitioners' appeal.
[16]
 The dispositive portion of its February 19, 2013 Decision reads:


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is 
DENIED
. Consequently, the Decision dated 26 February 2010 is hereby 
AFFIRMED in toto
.
[17]




 






The appellate court rejected petitioners' appeal on the ground that they
 failed to prove their title over the subject property and that the tax 
declarations under the name of their deceased mother, coupled with their
 allegations of possession of the subject property, did not suffice to 
substantiate their claims. Thus, there was no reason to overturn the 
trial court's ruling.
[18]



 



 
Undaunted, the petitioners elevated the case before Us raising the sole issue:


A. WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR OF 
LAW AND ACTED IN A MANNER NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF
 THIS HONORABLE COURT IN HOLDING THAT "PLAINTIFF-APPELLANTS FAILED TO 
PROVE THAT THEY HAVE EITHER LEGAL OR BENEFICIAL TITLE TO INSTITUTE THE 
ACTION TO QUIET TITLE AGAINST DEFENDANTSÂ­APPELLEES."
[19]


Petitioners' Arguments:



Petitioners argue in their Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[20]

 that the appellate court seriously erred in declaring that they have 
not proven their legal or beneficial title to institute the action to 
quiet title against the respondents despite the evidence that they have 
presented. They allege that the uncontroverted tax declarations under 
the name of their deceased mother support their claim of ownership. 
Their failure to declare the subject property in their names for 
taxation purposes does not destroy their title over it.
[21]





Moreover, the fact that the subject property had been mortgaged by their
 predecessors-in-interest in favor of several banks proves their 
ownership, considering that it is standard practice for banks to 
investigate the identity of the owner of the real property being offered
 as a collateral. The banks' approval of mortgages of the subject 
property under the name of their predecessors-in-interest points to the 
veracity of their claim of ownership. Furthermore, respondents' pieces 
of evidence did not show their actual possession over the subject 
property, which thus belies their claim of ownership. The testimonial 
evidence presented by the Gaetoses, particularly as regards the 
location, identity, and description of the subject property, clearly 
negates their claim of ownership. Lastly, the cadastral plan and the tax
 declarations presented by respondents are not conclusive proof of their
 ownership over the subject property.
[22]


Respondents' Arguments:



The respondents, in their Comment,
[23]

 are urging for the outright dismissal of the petition in view of its 
defective Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping. They 
point out that not all the petitioners signed the verification and 
certification against forum shopping. In addition, the petition raised 
purely factual matters which were already passed upon by the appellate 
court.
[24]



Even brushing aside technical infirmities, the respondents also aver 
that petitioners' appeal should nonetheless be denied for they failed to
 establish by preponderance of evidence their superior, legal, and 
substantive right over the property in dispute. The pieces of evidence 
they presented, including the tax declarations under the name of their 
mother, do not prove ownership and title over the subject property. They
 stress that both the trial court and the appellate court arrived at the
 same conclusion, which should no longer be disturbed.
[25]


Our Ruling



The petition is denied.






Consequence of a defective Verification and Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping.


 







The petition's Verification/Certification on Non-Forum Shopping
[26]
 was not signed by all the parties therein. This defect was duly admitted by the petitioners' in their Reply.
[27]
 However, they argue that such was not fatal nor was it jurisdictional as to affect their present appeal.
[28]



We agree. 
Altres v. Empleo
[29]

 laid down the following guidelines with respect to noncompliance with 
the requirements on or submission of a defective verification and 
certification against forum shopping:








1) 


A distinction must be made 
between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of 
defective verification, and non-compliance with the requirement on or 
submission of defective certification against forum shopping.














2) 


As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective.

 The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading
 if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the
 Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be 
served thereby.














3) 


Verification is deemed 
substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to
 the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the 
verification
, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.














4) 


As to certification against forum shopping, 
non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is
 generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction 
thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of 
"substantial compliance" or presence of "special circumstances or 
compelling reasons."














5) 


The certification against forum 
shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; 
otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the 
case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when 
all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a 
common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in 
the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the
 Rule.














6)


 Finally, the certification against forum 
shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, 
however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is 
unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating 
his counsel of record to sign on his behalf.
[30]
 (Emphases Ours)






Applying the above guidelines to the present case, We find that the 
subject Verification/Certification of Non-forum Shopping substantially 
complied with the rules.



Petitioners share a common interest and have similar claims in the 
subject property and that any one of them can be considered as "one who 
has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations" to sign 
the required verification. Moreover, their assertion of a common cause 
of action or defense empowers any one of them to sign the certification 
against forum shopping to substantially comply with the rule. After all,
 it has been held that under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, as
 in this case where the petitioners share a common interest and invoke a
 common cause of action or defense, the rule requiring all such 
plaintiffs or petitioners to sign the certification against forum 
shopping may be relaxed.
[31]











 



It should be noted that the rules on verification and certification 
against forum shopping are designed to promote and facilitate the 
orderly administration of justice. Hence, they should not be interpreted
 with such absolute literalness as to subvert their own ultimate and 
legitimate objectives. The requirement of strict compliance merely 
underscores their mandatory nature to the effect that the verification 
and certification against forum shopping cannot altogether be dispensed 
with or their requirements completely disregarded. They do not prohibit 
substantial compliance with the rules under justifiable circumstances.
[32]



Therefore, this Court cannot dismiss petitioners' appeal at its 
inception on account of the formal defects in the 
verification/certification of non-forum shopping.






Discretionary power to review; appeal not a matter of right but must comply with requirements for its perfection.


 







Respondents point to another defect in the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
. It involves petitioners' act of raising purely questions of fact.



We emphasize at the outset that a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari

 is a remedy under the law confined to settle questions of law and not 
questions of facts. The settled rule is that only questions of law may 
be raised in a petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Rule 45, 
Section 1 reads:


Section 1.
 
Filing of petition with Supreme Court
. - A party desiring to appeal by 
certiorari

 from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, 
the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever 
authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition 
for review on 
certiorari
. 
The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.
 (1a, 2a) (Emphasis supplied)



In 
Republic of the Philippines v. Malabanan
,
[33]

 this Court distinguished a question of law from a question of fact. "A 
question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a 
certain state of [undisputed] facts, while there is a question of fact 
when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts."


Question of fact requires courts to review the truthfulness 
or falsity of the allegations of the parties. This review includes 
assessment of the "probative value of the evidence presented." There is 
also a question of fact when the issue presented is the correctness of 
the lower court's appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties.
[34]




 





It is not this Court's function to analyze or weigh all over again 
evidence already considered in the proceedings below. Our jurisdiction 
is limited to reviewing only errors of law that may have been committed 
by the lower court. As it is, the resolution of factual issues is the 
function of the lower courts, whose findings on these matters are 
received with respect.
[35]



However, this Court may take exceptions when: (1) the conclusion is 
grounded on speculations, surmises, or conjectures; (2) the inference is
 manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of
 discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) 
the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) there is no citation of 
specific evidence on which the factual findings are based; (7) the 
findings of absence of fact are contradicted by the presence of evidence
 on record; (8) the findings of theCA are contrary to those of the trial
 court; (9) the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant and undisputed
 facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different 
conclusion; (10) the findings of the CA are beyond the issues of the 
case; and (11) such findings are contrary to the admissions of both 
parties.
[36]
 Petitioners, 
however, must not merely allege the presence of exceptions but must 
fully explain why exceptions to the rule must apply.





Here, petitioners raise the lone issue that the appellate court 
committed serious error of law and acted in a manner not in accord with 
the applicable decisions of the Court. In support of such issue, they 
advance the following allegations: (1) the trial court erred in 
declaring that they do not have the requisite title to pursue their 
claim, notwithstanding their predecessors-inÂ­interests' possession of 
the property, who even mortgaged the subject property and declared it 
under their name for tax purposes; (2) the trial court erred in failing 
to appreciate and give weight to the evidence presented, the testimonies
 of their witnesses, and their documentary evidence; and (3) the trial 
court erred in dismissing their case.
[37]



Petitioners' core allegations would entail a review of the factual 
circumstances already determined and similarly concluded by the lower 
courts. They are essentially questioning the lower courts' appreciation 
of evidence and asking this Court to weigh them all over again, an 
undertaking that is not allowed in a petition filed under Rule 45. 
Moreover, this invocation of factual review is bereft of a full 
explanation why the exception to our reviewing power should be 
exercised.











 



Thus, the present petition must fail on this ground.
[38]



Even if we relax the rules on review, the petition must still fail for lack of merit.






In an action for quieting
 of title, the plaintiff has the burden to show by preponderance of 
evidence that they have a legal and equitable title to or interest in 
the real property subject of the action.


 






Spouses Basa v. Loy
[39]
 reiterated the requirements in order that an action to quiet title may prosper, thus:


In order that an action for quieting of title may prosper, 
it
 is essential that the plaintiff must have legal or equitable title to, 
or interest in, the property which is the subject-matter of the action
. Legal title denotes registered ownership, while equitable title means beneficial ownership. 
In the absence of such legal or equitable title, or interest, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed.


x x x x


An action for quieting of title is essentially a common law remedy grounded on equity. 
The
 competent court is tasked to determine the respective rights of the 
complainant and other claimants, not only to place things in their 
proper place, to make the one who has no rights to said immovable 
respect and not disturb the other, but also for the benefit of both, so 
that he who has the right would see every cloud of doubt over the 
property dissipated, and he could afterwards without fear introduce the 
improvements he may desire, to use, and even to abuse the property as he
 deems best. But 'for an action to quiet title to prosper, two 
indispensable requisites must concur, namely: (1) the plaintiff or 
complainant has a legal or an equitable title to or interest in the real
 property subject of the action; and (2) the deed, claim, encumbrance, 
or proceeding claimed to be casting cloud on his title must be shown to 
be in fact invalid or inoperative despite its 
prima facie
 appearance of validity or legal efficacy.'
 [Emphasis supplied; citation omitted]









 





The requirements find basis in Articles 476 and 477 of the Civil Code which state:


Article 476.
 Whenever there is a cloud on title to 
real property or any interest therein, by reason of any instrument, 
record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding which is apparently valid or 
effective but is in truth and in fact invalid, ineffective, voidable, or
 unenforceable, and may be prejudicial to said title, an action may be 
brought to remove such cloud or to quiet the title.




An action may also be brought to prevent a cloud from being cast upon title to real property or any interest therein.


Article 477.
 The plaintiff must have legal or equitable title to,
 or interest in the real property which is the subject matter of the 
action. He need not be in possession of said property.



It is thus clear that legal or equitable title to, or interest in, the 
real property subject matter of the action must be established by the 
plaintiffs as a prerequisite in order for their action to quiet title to
 prosper.



Here, petitioners did not have a legal title to the subject property. 
There were no certificates of title in their respective names. Moreover,
 based on the findings of the lower courts, they also failed to 
substantiate their claim of having equitable title as well.
[40]

 The tax declarations under the names of their predecessor-in-interests,
 documentation alluding to mortgages, and the testimonial evidence they 
have presented did not convincingly establish their equitable title over
 the subject property.



As accurately ruled by both the trial court and the appellate court, tax
 declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership or 
of the right to possess land when not supported by other evidence.
[41]

 Mere allegation of open, continuous, and exclusive possession of the 
property in dispute without substantiation does not meet the 
requirements of the law.



Hence, based on the foregoing, petitioners failed at the outset to 
establish the first requirement of having legal or equitable title over 
the property in dispute. Their cause of action for quieting of title 
simply cannot prosper. In view of their lack of title, legal or 
equitable, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed and there is no 
case of quieting of title to speak of.

Section 5. Dismissal or denial of petition. - The failure of the 
petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements regarding 
the payment of the docket and other lawful fees, deposit for costs, 
proof of service of the petition, and the contents of and the documents 
which should accompany the petition shall be sufficient ground for the 
dismissal thereof.


The Supreme Court may on its own initiative deny the petition on the 
ground that the appeal is without merit, or is prosecuted manifestly for
 delay, or that the questions raised therein are too unsubstantial to 
require consideration.
