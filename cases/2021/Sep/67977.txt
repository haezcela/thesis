D E C I S I O N




LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


 


The Case 




 This Petition for Review on Certiorari seeks to reverse and 
set aside the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. 
SP No. 135555:
  






1)


Decision
[1]

 dated May 21, 2015 which reversed the trial court's order denying 
respondents' motion to dismiss the complaint below for cancellation of 
deeds of sale, annulment of title, and reconveyance with damages; and














2)


Resolution
[2]
 dated November 25, 2015 which denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.








Antecedents


 On March 19, 2013, petitioner (Zenaida D. Roa) filed the aforesaid
 complaint against respondents Marie Antoinette R. Francisco 
(Francisco), Spouses Robinson K., and Mary Valerie S. Sy (Spouses Sy), 
and Register of Deeds of Makati City (RD Makati). The case was raffled 
to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) - Branch 66, Makati City.
[3]
 


 Petitioner averred that, as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of 
Title (TCT) No. 133936, she and her sister Amelia Roa (Amelia) are the 
legitimate owners of a property located at 73 Amorsolo Street, San 
Lorenzo Village, Makati City. On August 5, 2012, she learned from a 
relative that  their  title  had  been  cancelled  by  the  RD  Makati, 
 and  by virtue of a deed of sale, a new TCT No. 006-2012000849 was 
issued in the name of Francisco. The deed of sale was purportedly 
executed between  her  and  her  sister  Amelia,  on  the  one  hand,  
and  their niece Francisco, on the other.
[4]

 It was impossible for her to have signed the deed of sale since she was
 in Washington D.C. at the time it was purportedly executed on July 6, 
2012 and notarized on July 10, 2012. She left the Philippines on March 
20, 2012 and returned only on August 24, 2012, as evidenced by her 
arrival and departure record issued by the Bureau of Immigration. On the
 other hand, her sister Amelia could not have signed the same on her own
 volition since she had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for the 
last ten (10) years already prior to the supposed date of the sale.
[5]
 

 Francisco subsequently sold the property to Spouses Sy for 
P35,000,000.00 under Deed of Sale dated July 20, 2012. Consequently, a 
new TCT No. 006-2012000889 was further issued in the name of Spouses Sy.
[6]
 

 Francisco was able to secure a title in her name only on July 16, 2012,
 while the sale of the same property to Spouses Sy was supposedly done 
on July 20, 2012. At the time Francisco and Spouses Sy started 
negotiating on the sale, the latter already knew of the existence of her
 title considering the close proximity between the date the sale to 
Spouses Sy took place and the date Francisco secured a certificate of 
title in her name. During respondents' initial negotiation, petitioner 
and Amelia were still the registered owners of the property. This should
 have alerted Spouses Sy on the legality of Francisco's claimed title. 
As part of their due diligence, they should have made further inquiries 
on the identity of the legitimate owner of the property. More, the fact 
that the only handwritten entry in the Deed of Sale dated July 20, 2012,
 was the property's title number should have made Spouses Sy suspicious 
of Francisco's title. Spouses Sy, therefore, are not buyers in good 
faith, hence, the sale of the property in their favor is void.
[7]
 Accordingly, they ought to return the property to its legitimate owners (she and Amelia). 

 Instead of filing an answer, Spouses Sy filed a motion to dismiss on 
the ground of failure to state a cause of action. The complaint 
allegedly rested on conjectures and contained no specific averments of 
bad faith on their part.
[8]
 
Spouses Sy further claimed that they acted in good faith when they 
relied on Francisco's title and noted no suspicious circumstances 
attending the sale transaction. 
 
The Ruling of the Regional Trial Court


 By Order
[9]
 dated 
August 7, 2013, the trial court denied Spouses Sy's motion to dismiss 
for lack of merit. It noted that the complaint stated that petitioners 
were the registered owners of the property. Francisco fraudulently 
registered the property in her name by presenting a spurious and forged 
deed of sale. Ultimately, Spouses Sy purchased the property from 
Francisco despite her fraudulent title.
[10]
 
 Spouses Sy's motion for reconsideration was denied under Order
[11]

  dated March 26, 2014. Thereafter, they filed a "Motion for Bill of 
Particulars dated April 14, 2014 and later an "Amended Motion for Bill 
of Particulars" dated April 15, 2014. They required herein petitioner to
 answer the following questions:
[12]




 3.1	Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that it was Marie 
Antoinette Roa Francisco, Marie Celine Roa Francisco and/or Amelia Roa 
who had actual and physical possession of the house and lot located at 
73 Amorsolo Street, San Lorenzo Village, Makati City (the "Property") on
 20 July 2012? 


 3.2	Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she did not have actual and physical possession of the property on 20 July 2012? 


 3.3	Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that it was her niece 
Marie Antoinette Roa Francisco who was in actual and physical possession
 of the original owner's duplicate title to the Property currently 
covered by TCT No. 006-201200889 on 20 July 2012?


 3.4	Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she did not have 
actual and physical possession of the original owner's duplicate title 
to the property currently covered by TCT No. 006-201200889 on 20 July 
2012? 


 3.5	Is plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa a US Citizen? 


 3.5	(sic) Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she did not 
take any action before the Register of Deeds for the protection of the 
public on or after December 2011, when "she came across an Earnest Money
 Agreement purportedly executed by Antoinette Francisco in favor of a 
certain Zoilo De La Cruz, the subject matter of which is the sale of the
 Amorsolo property covered by TCT No. 133936, xxx"[?]


 3.6	Did plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa file any action to cancel or to
 void the Earnest Money Agreement between Marie Antoinette R. Francisco 
and Zoilo De La Cruz? 


 3.7	Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she never caused the
 title covering the property to be annotated with a "lis pendens 
annotation" at the Register of Deeds when according to par. 12 of her 
Complaint, she filed on 4 June 2012, a Petition to Surrender Withheld 
Owner's Duplicate or To Cancel Owner's Duplicate Copy of Title and 
Issuance of New Owner's Duplicate Copy of Title under Section 107 of 
P.D. 1529 against Antoinette, which had been docketed as LRC Case No. 
M-5668 before Branch 134 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City? 


 3.8	Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that the case she filed, 
namely the Petition to Surrender Withheld Owner's Duplicate or To Cancel
 Owner's Duplicate Copy of Title and Issuance of New Owner's Duplicate 
Copy of Title under Section 107 of P.D. 1529 against Marie Antoinette 
Francisco, which had been docketed as LRC Case No. M-5668 x x x was 
dismissed? 


 3.9. Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she did not 
annotate her alleged claim x x x on the title covering the Property that
 would alert or put a prospective purchaser on notice? 




 The trial court granted the motion under Order
[13]
 dated September 16, 2014, and ordered petitioner to submit her bill of particulars. Petitioner promptly complied.
[14]
 

 Meantime, on Spouses Sy's motion, the presiding judge of Branch 66 
inhibited from the case. Thereafter, the case got re-raffled to Branch 
148.
[15]
 
 While the proceedings below were ongoing, Spouses Sy also pursued a petition for 
certiorari
 under CA G.R. SP No. 135555, assailing the earlier denial of their motion to dismiss. 
 
The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals


 In CA G.R. SP No. 135555, Spouses Sy faulted the trial court 
with grave abuse of discretion for denying their motion to dismiss 
notwithstanding that the complaint purportedly failed to state a cause 
of action against them. The complaint was supposedly based on mere 
conclusions or opinions and not on ultimate facts, hence, it failed to 
pass the test of sufficiency of cause of action.
[16]
 Spouses Sy, too, asserted they are buyers in good faith. 
 
The Ruling of the Court of
 Appeals 


 In its assailed Decision
[17]
 dated May 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed.
[18]

 It ruled that petitioner failed to particularly allege when Spouses Sy 
started to negotiate with Francisco for the purchase of the property. 
This is allegedly an ultimate fact necessary to determine whether 
Spouses Sy exercised due diligence in ascertaining the genuineness of 
Francisco's title. The lack of this particular averment supposedly calls
 for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of lack of cause of 
action against Spouses Sy.
[19]

 Further, Spouses Sy were supposedly not obliged to look beyond the face
 of Francisco's title which contained no annotation of any adverse 
claim. They had no notice of any defect in her title, hence, they are 
essentially buyers in good faith. 
 Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied under Resolution
[20]
 dated November 25, 2015. 
 
The Present Petition


 Petitioner now seeks affirmative relief from the Court 
via

 Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. She maintains that her complaint 
sufficiently states a cause of action against Spouses Sy. Any defect or 
uncertainty in her complaint had already been cured by the bill of 
particulars she subsequently filed.
[21]

 Even assuming her complaint was deficient, the Court of Appeals, 
instead of  ordering  its  dismissal,  should  have  required  her  to 
file an  amended complaint.
[22]

 On the other hand, Spouses Sy reiterate that the complaint fails to 
sufficiently allege a cause of action against them. It contains no 
particular allegation of any wrongful or illegal act on their part that 
violated petitioner's right. Cause of action is to be determined from 
the allegations of the complaint. Thus, the deficiency cannot be cured 
by their subsequent filing of a bill of particulars. Lastly, they claim 
anew that they are buyers in good faith.
[23]
 
 
Issue
 

 Did the Court of Appeals commit reversible error when it dismissed the 
complaint against Spouses Sy on the ground that petitioner has no cause 
of action against them, albeit what the latter actually pleaded was 
another ground, that is, failure to state a cause of action? 
 
Our Ruling






The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the complaint on the ground of lack of cause of action
 






To begin with, Spouses Sy sought the dismissal of the complaint on 
the ground of failure to state a cause of action against them. Hence, it
 is a reversible error for the Court of Appeals to have 
motu proprio
 taken cognizance of an entirely different ground, 
i.e.
, lack of cause of action, to justify the dismissal of the complaint. 
  
 In 
Colmenar v. Colmenar et al.
,
[24]

 petitioner Frank Colmenar filed a complaint for declaration of nullity 
of deeds of extrajudicial settlement of estate, deeds of sale, 
cancellation of titles, and damages against Property Company of Friends 
(ProFriends) and other defendants. ProFriends invoked as affirmative 
defense petitioner's alleged lack of cause of action against it, while 
the other defendants invoked the complaint's failure to state a cause of
 action against them. The trial court eventually dismissed the complaint
 against all the defendants on the ground of failure to state a cause of
 action, even as against ProFriends. The Court held that the trial court
 erred in dismissing the complaint against ProFriends on a ground 
entirely different from that which it actually raised in its motion to 
dismiss. 
 While the courts may not 
motu proprio 
dismiss a 
complaint based on a ground or grounds not pleaded by a party in a 
motion to dismiss or in the answer with affirmative defenses, the same 
may be done under the following instances, 
viz
.: (1) the court 
has no jurisdiction over the subject matter; (2) there is another case 
pending between the same parties for the same cause; (3) where the 
action is barred by 
res judicata
; or (4) where the action is barred by prescription.
[25]

 Failure to state a cause of action and lack of cause of action are not 
included in the enumeration. Hence, what is excluded is not deemed 
included.
 In any event, it has been repeatedly held that failure to state a cause of action and lack of cause of action 
are distinct and separate grounds to dismiss a particular action
. 
Apostolic Vicar of Tabuk, Inc. v. Spouses Sison
,
[26]

 explained that failure to state a cause of action refers to the 
insufficiency of the allegations in the pleading, while lack of cause of
 action refers to the insufficiency of the factual basis for the action.
 Dismissal for failure to state a cause of action may be raised at the 
earliest stages of the proceedings through a motion to dismiss under 
Rule 16 of the 1997 Rules of Court
[27]
 or raised as an affirmative defense in an answer, while dismissal for lack of cause of action may be raised any time 
after
 the questions of fact have been resolved on the basis of stipulations, admissions or evidence presented by the plaintiff. 
Asia Brewery, Inc. v. Equitable PCI Bank
,
[28]
 further ordained: 
  


 
Failure to state
 a cause of action 
is not the same
 as 
lack
 of cause of action; 
the terms are not interchangeable
.
 It may be observed that lack of cause of action is not among the 
grounds that may be raised in a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the 
Rules of Court. The dismissal of a Complaint for lack of cause of action
 is based on Section 1 of Rule 33, which provides: 




 Section 1. Demurrer to evidence. - After the plaintiff has 
completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant may move for 
dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff 
has shown no right to relief. If his motion is denied he shall have the 
right to present evidence. If the motion is granted but on appeal the 
order of dismissal is reversed, he shall be deemed to have waived the 
right to present evidence. 




 
If the Complaint 
fails to state
 a cause of action, a 
motion to dismiss must be made before a responsive pleading is filed; 
and the issue can be resolved only on the basis of the allegations in 
the initiatory pleading. On the other hand, if the Complaint 
lacks
 a cause of action, the motion to dismiss must be filed after the plaintiff has rested its case.
 


 In the first situation, the veracity of the allegations is 
immaterial; however, in the second situation, the judge must determine 
the veracity of the allegations based on the evidence presented. 


 x x x x 


Hence, in order to resolve whether the Complaint 
lacked

 a cause of action, respondent must have presented evidence to dispute 
the presumption that the signatories validly and intentionally delivered
 the instrument. 


 x x x x


 The test to determine whether a complaint states a cause of 
action against the defendants is this: admitting hypothetically the 
truth of the allegations of fact made in the complaint, may a judge 
validly grant the relief demanded in the complaint? (Emphasis supplied)
[29]
 


 x x x x 




To emphasize, lack of cause of action may only be raised 
after

 the questions of fact have been resolved on the basis of stipulations 
or admissions or evidence presented by the plaintiff. Before then, it 
cannot be raised as a ground for dismissal; much less, can the court 
dismiss the case on that ground. 
  




The filing of the motion for a bill
 of particulars, which in truth is a request for written interrogatories
 negates the claim of Spouses Sy that the complaint states no cause of 
action against them
 






A cause of action is defined as an act or omission by which a party violates a right of another.
[30]

 A complaint states a cause of action if it sufficiently avers the 
existence of the three (3) essential elements of a cause of action, 
namely: (a) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and 
under whatever law it arises or is created; (b) an obligation on the 
part of the named defendant to respect or not to violate such right; and
 (c) an act or omission on the part of the named defendant violative of 
the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of
 defendant to the plaintiff for which the latter may maintain an action 
for recovery of damages.  
  
 If, however, the complaint contains ambiguity, indefiniteness,
 or uncertainty, a party may move for a more definite statement or for a
 bill of particulars of any matter which is not averred with sufficient 
definiteness or particularity to enable him or her to properly prepare 
his or her responsive pleading or to prepare for trial.
[31]
 

 It is not the office of a bill of particulars to supply material 
allegations necessary to the validity of a pleading, or to change a 
cause of action or defense stated in the pleading, or to state a cause 
of action or defense other than the one stated. Also, it is not the 
office or function of a bill of particulars to set forth the pleader's 
theory of his cause of action or a rule of evidence on which he intends 
to rely or to furnish evidential information whether such information 
consists of evidence which the pleader proposes to introduce or of facts
 which constitute a defense.
[32]
 

 This means that when parties seek a bill of particulars, they in effect
 admit that the complaint bears the ultimate facts comprising a valid 
cause of action. What they ask for though is simply a specification of 
these ultimate facts to enable them to properly prepare their responsive
 pleading or to prepare for trial.
[33]

 Consequently, any challenge against the complaint based on its supposed
 failure to state a cause of action is no longer feasible after the 
parties have sought a bill of particulars. So must it be. 
 We now go to requests for written interrogatories. Under Section 1, Rule 25 of the Rules of Court,
[34]

 a request for written interrogatories is a mode of discovery by which a
 party serves on the other party written interrogatories to be answered 
by the party served. It seeks to elicit material and relevant facts from
 the adverse party. 
 Generally, modes of discovery enable parties
 to unmask their respective pieces of evidence to facilitate trial on 
the merits. Parties are required to lay their cards on the table so that
 justice can be rendered expeditiously.
[35]

 A party defendant will not be inclined to reveal evidentiary matters 
unless he or she recognizes the existence of the adverse party's cause 
of action and anticipates the case to proceed with trial.
[36]
 

 It goes without saying, therefore, that when parties avail of any mode 
of discovery under the Rules, in this case, a request for written 
interrogatories (albeit erroneously referred to by Spouses Sy here as a 
bill of particulars), they are deemed to have recognized the existence 
and sufficiency of the allegations of the adverse party's cause of 
action in the complaint. They no longer put in issue the sufficiency of 
the allegations of the adverse party's cause of action. Rather, they ask
 that evidentiary matters be unveiled so that better preparation for the
 subsequent trial on the merits of the case may be had.
[37]
 

 Here, Spouses Sy filed their so-called motion for bill of particulars 
which in reality is a request for written interrogatories. For the 
questions they posed were not meant to clarify the averments or 
statements found in petitioner's complaint, much less, inquire into the 
existence and sufficiency of petitioner's cause of action. In truth, 
their questions sought to discover evidentiary matters relating to their
 defense that they are buyers in good faith and that petitioner failed 
to exercise reasonable diligence in protecting her title to the 
property. For context, we quote anew these questions, 
viz
.: 
  


 3.2 Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she did not have 
actual and physical possession of the property on 20 July 2012? 
Response: Although Zenaida was not in the subject property on that date,
 she had constructive possession of the property as a registered owner 
thereof. It was incumbent upon any supposed into the provenance of 
Antoinette's title to the Property especially where Antoinette sold the 
Property to the Sps. (sic) Sy on the same date that the title was 
released by the Register of Deeds on July 20, 2012. 


 x x x x


 3.8 Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that the case she filed, 
namely the Petition to Surrender Withheld Owner's Duplicate or To Cancel
 Owner's Duplicate Copy of Title and Issuance of New Owner's Duplicate 
Copy of Title under Section 107 of P.D. 1529 against Marie Antoinette 
Francisco, which had been docketed as LRC Case No. M-5668 x x x was 
dismissed? 


 Response: LRC Case No. M-5668 was dismissed on August 31, 2012. 
It became moot since Antoinette fraudulently transferred the title to 
the Property to her name on July 6, 2012 by forging the signatures of 
Amelia and Zenaida and later sold it to Sps. Sy on July 20, 2012 under 
circumstances indicating Sps. Sy were buyers-in-bad-faith - 
i.e
.,








a.)


All the terms and 
conditions of the Deed of Sale dated July 20, 2012 were computer-printed
 while the title number (sic) of the title (TCT No. 006-2012000849) in 
the "whereas" clause was handwritten. This shows that at the time the 
Sps. Sy showed interest in and negotiated for the sale of the subject 
property, the title to the property was still under the names of Zenaida
 and Amelia Roa. Sps. Sy must have known that Marie Antoinette was not 
yet the registered owner of the property. Otherwise, if at the time Sps.
 Sy. negotiated for the sale and actually executed the Deed of Sale, the
 property was also registered in the name Antoinette Roa Francisco under
 TCT No. 006-2012000849, then there is no reason why the title number 
would also have been entered in the Deed of Sale and computer-printed, 
and not (sic) handwritten. 






 


 






b.)


TCT No. 006-2012000849 in the name of
 Marie Antoinette Francisco was released only on July 20, 2012, and yet,
 the Deed of Sale from Antoinette to Sps. Sy was executed and notarized 
on the same day â July 20, 2012. This shows that at the time Sps Sy 
showed interest and negotiated for the sale of the subject property, Sps
 Sy must have known that the property was still registered in the names 
of Zenaida D. Roa and Amelia D. Roa; that this should have alerted Sps. 
Sy to investigate the real owners of the property and the validity of 
the Deed of Absolute Sale from Zenaida and Amelia Roa to Antoinette; 
that it is common knowledge and practice before a sale of highly-priced 
properties such as this one involving P35,000,000, (sic) negotiations 
and due investigation would have been done by the buyer and human 
experience dictates that this could not have been done on the same day 
as the title of the property of interest was released. This also 
explains why the title in the Deed of Sale was "handwritten" instead of 
being computer-printed. This shows that at the time of the negotiation 
for the sale and drafting of the Deed of Absolute Sale, the title was 
still under the names of Zenaida and Amelia Roa and the subsequent title
 number had to be hand-written in the Deed of Absolute Sale when the 
title was released on July 20, 2012.






 


 






c.)


The Sps. Sy or their agents, also 
required that Ma. Celine F. Abiera sign and indicate her conformity to 
the Deed of Sale. However, there was no need for Celine to conform to 
the Deed of Absolute Sale since she had no apparent or registered 
interest in the Property. Celine, a businesswoman, would not have 
assented to the sale if there was nothing amiss in the transaction which
 Sps. Sy sought to cover. Her conformity to the sale highlights the bad 
faith of the Sps. Sy. 








3.9. Does plaintiff Zenaida D. Roa deny that she did not annotate
 her alleged claim on the Property on the title covering the Property 
that would alert or put a prospective purchaser on notice? 


 Response: Zenaida need not annotate her claim on the property 
since she is a registered co-owner of the property. More importantly, a 
purchaser, like defendant Sps. Sy, cannot close their eyes to important 
facts above-described which would have created suspicion on the validity
 and integrity of the sale of the property and transfer of the title 
from Amelia and Zenaida to Antoinette and should have investigated the 
circumstances of the transfer.
[38]
 




 As stated, these questions or the answers sought already delve on 
matters of evidence which by law and jurisprudence would generally 
establish the good faith of a buyer in purchasing a property.
[39]

 Thus, by seeking answers to these interrogatories, Spouses Sy 
effectively acknowledged the existence and sufficiency of the 
allegations in the complaint pertaining to petitioners' cause of action 
against them. The filing of the request for written interrogatories, 
therefore, is a supervening event which bars Spouses Sy from pursuing 
their theory of failure to state a cause of action in CA G.R. SP No. 
135555.
  




The complaint states a cause of action against Spouses Sy
 






At any rate, the complaint contains sufficient allegations to support a cause of action against Spouses Sy, thus: 
  


 21.	The Deed of Absolute Sale [d]ated July 20, 2012 executed by 
Antoinette in favor of Sps. Sy should also be declared null and void, 
and TCT No. 006-211200889 should also be cancelled and declared without 
force and effect, considering that the Sps. Sy are buyers-in-bad faith. A
 close examination of this Deed of Absolute Sale will show that all the 
terms and conditions were computer-printed EXCEPT for the title number 
and appearing in the first "whereas clause" in page one thereof. The 
title number is handwritten. This fact would lead to an indisputable 
conclusion that at the time the Sps. Sy showed interest and negotiated 
for the sale of the subject property, the title of the property is still
 under the names of Zenaida and Amelia Roa. Sps. Sy must have known that
 Marie Antoinette was not yet the registered owner of the property. 
Otherwise, if at the time Sps. Sy negotiated for the sale and actually 
executed the Deed of Sale, the property was already registered in the 
name Marie Antoinette Roa Francisco under TCT No. 006-2012000849, then 
there is no reason why the title number would also have been entered in 
the Deed of Sale and computer-printed, and not (sic) handwritten. 


 22.	Also, the proximity of the date (July 20, 2012) of the Deed 
of Sale from Antoinette to Sps. Sy with the date (July 16, 2012) of the 
release and issuance of TCT No. 006-20122000849 to Antoinette, will lead
 to the reasonable conclusion that at the time Sps. Sy showed interest 
and negotiated for the sale of the subject property, Sps. Sy must have 
known that the property is still registered in the names of Zenaida D. 
Roa and Amelia D. Roa. This should have alerted Sps. Sy to investigate 
the real owners of the property and the validity of the Deed of Absolute
 Sale from Zenaida and Amelia to Antoinette. It is common knowledge and 
practice before a sale of highly priced properties such as this one, 
negotiations and due investigation would have been done by the buyer and
 human experience dictates that this could not be done simply in a 
matter of six days. 


 23.	Even Atty. Tomas F. Dulay, Jr., the notary public who 
purportedly notarized the Deed of Sale of Antoinette and Sps. Sy, has 
denied he notarized the same. Not being a public document, the Deed of 
Sale could not have transmitted any right to the Sps. Sy and it should 
have never been registered with the Register of Deeds. A copy of the 
Affidavit of Atty. Dulay is attached hereto as Annex "R".


 24.	The fraudulent Deeds of Sale could not have vested any right
 in favor of Antoinette and Sps. Sy over the subject property, including
 the transfer of its registration in their names, to the prejudice of 
Zenaida and her co-owner Amelia. Antoinette and Sps. Sy illegally 
transferred the property in their names and have the obligation to 
return it to the true owners, Zenaida and Amelia.

 In fine, petitioner essentially claims that: (a) she and Amelia 
are the legitimate owners of the subject property; (b) Francisco 
acquired title to the property through fraud by forging a deed of sale 
making it appear that she and Amelia sold the property to her; (c) 
Francisco's title was issued only on July 16, 2012, and the sale in 
favor of Spouses Sy was dated July 20, 2012, just days apart; (d) 
Spouses Sy were aware that at the time they negotiated with Francisco 
for the sale of the property, the latter was not yet the registered 
owner of the property as evidenced by the mere handwritten annotation in
 the title; and (e) Spouses Sy are buyers in bad faith because despite 
the apparent irregularity in the manner by which Francisco obtained 
title to the property, they turned a blind eye and did not further 
investigate on the legality of the seller Francisco's title and her 
authority to sell the property. 
 Here, assuming the foregoing 
allegations to be true, petitioner and her sister Amelia, as registered 
owners of the property, have the right to the relief prayed for, 
i.e.
, to declare as void the Deed of Sale of the property in favor of Spouses Sy who are buyers in bad faith.
