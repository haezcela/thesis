BANGKO SENTRAL NG PILIPINAS, PETITIONER, VS. NELSON C. BOOL, RESPONDENT.

HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the January 21, 2013 Decision
[2]
 and May 20, 2013 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. SP No. 123467, which affirmed with modification the November 15, 2011 Decision
[4]
 and the February 1, 2012 Resolution
[5]

 of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) finding respondent Nelson C. Bool
 (Bool) guilty of gross neglect of duty and suspending him from office 
without pay for one year.
 
The Antecedents: 
 On 
August 11, 2005, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) awarded the 
contract for the supply and delivery of finished banknotes to Francois 
Charles Oberthur Fiduciare (FCOF), a French firm engaged in private 
security printing. The contract was for the production and delivery of 
160 million pieces of 100-Piso notes equivalent to US$5,264,000.00 and 
89 million pieces of 1,000-Piso notes equivalent to US$2,996,000.00.
[6]
 On August 17, 2005, FCOF extended an invitation to BSP to send its representative to witness the production of the 
litho
 and 
intaglio
 printed sheets and approve the same. The 
litho
 plate is used in the process of printing the background features of the banknote while the 
intaglio
 plate is used in the process of printing the embossed features of the banknote, such as the Philippine President's name.
[7]

 On September 15, 2005, the BSP authorized respondent Bool to travel to 
Rennes, France as BSP's representative. Bool was tasked to ensure that 
the quality of the printed sheets conformed to the BSP's prescribed 
specifications for the 100-Piso and 1000-Piso denominations before the 
start of the actual production.
[8]

 Unfortunately, on November 9, 2005, it was discovered that the surname 
of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the 100-Piso outsourced 
notes was misspelled as "Arroyo" instead of "Arroyo."
[9]
 Perforce, the BSP formally charged Bool with gross neglect of duty. In the BSP Investigation Report
[10]

 dated December 10, 2009, petitioner was adjudged guilty of gross 
neglect of duty and was meted out the penalty of dismissal from service,
 with forfeiture of retirement benefits, cancellation of civil service 
eligibility, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the 
government service.
[11]
 Bool filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by the BSP in its October 4, 2010 Resolution.
[12]
 Thus, he elevated the case to the CSC. 
 
Ruling of the Civil Service Commission:
 
 In a Decision
[13]

 dated November 15, 2011, the CSC affirmed the BSP's findings and also 
imposed the additional accessory penalty of "bar from taking the Civil 
Service Examination," to wit: 
  


 WHEREFORE, the appeal of Nelson C. Bool, Manager I, Simultan 
Division Banknote Printing Group, Banknotes and Securities Printing 
Department (BPSD), Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), is hereby 
DISMISSED. Accordingly, the Decision dated December 10, 2009 of the 
Monetary Board, finding Bool guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty and 
imposing upon him the penalty of dismissal from the service with the 
accessory penalties of forfeiture of retirement benefits, cancellation 
of Civil Service eligibility and perpetual disqualification from 
reemployment in the government service, and the Resolution dated October
 4, 2010, denying his motion for reconsideration, are AFFIRMED. The 
accessory penalty of bar from taking Civil Service examination is 
likewise imposed.
[14]




 In a Resolution
[15]
 dated February 1, 2012, the CSC denied Bool's Motion for Reconsideration. 
 Thus, Bool filed a Petition for Review with the CA. 
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals: 
 In its Decision
[16]

 dated January 21, 2013, the appellate court partly granted Bool's 
Petition and modified the penalty recommended by the CSC from dismissal 
from service to suspension from office for one year. Pertinent portions 
of the Decision read as follows: 
  


 Following the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Hao v. Andres
,
 We find the penalty imposed by the CSC on petitioner to be too harsh. 
In view of the presence of several mitigating circumstances available to
 petitioner in this case, We hereby lower the penalty imposed on 
petitioner to one (1) year suspension, without pay. 


 WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, the petition is PARTLY 
GRANTED. The Decision dated 15 November 2011 of the Civil Service 
Commission finding petitioner guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty and its 
Resolution dated 1 February 2012 Order denying his Motion for 
Reconsideration are hereby AFFIRMED subject to the MODIFICATION that 
petitioner is merely SUSPENDED from office without pay for ONE (1) YEAR.
 


 SO ORDERED.
[17]
 (Citation omitted) 




 In a Resolution
[18]
 
dated May 20, 2013, the appellate court denied BSP's Motion for 
Reconsideration for being bereft of merit. Thus, this Petition for 
Review on 
Certiorari
. 
 
Issue


 Whether or not the appellate court erred when it downgraded 
respondent's penalty to suspension for one year thereby disregarding the
 applicable laws and jurisprudence penalizing gross neglect of duty with
 dismissal from the service. 
 
Our Ruling


 We grant the Petition. 
 Gross neglect of duty is a grave offense under Section 52 (A) (2), Rule IV
[19]

 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service 
(Uniform Rules). The Uniform Rules prescribe the penalty of dismissal 
from service for gross neglect of duty even if committed for the first 
time. 
 Section 46 (A)(2), Rule 10
[20]

 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service 
(Revised Rules) similarly classified gross neglect of duty as a grave 
offense. However, Section 53, Rule IV
[21]

 of the Uniform Rules recognized the application of mitigating, 
aggravating, or alternative circumstances in the imposition of 
administrative penalties. Notably, both provisions do not expressly 
state that mitigating, aggravating, or alternative circumstances should 
not be considered when the prescribed penalty for the administrative 
offense is an indivisible penalty, such as dismissal from the service.
 
Duque III v. Veloso (Duque)
[22]
  sheds light on this issue:
  


 It is true that Section 53, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules 
provides the application of mitigating, aggravating or alternative 
circumstances in the imposition of administrative penalties. Section 53,
 Rule IV 
applies only when clear proof is shown, using the specific 
standards set by law and jurisprudence, that the facts in a given case 
justify the mitigation
 of the prescribed penalty.
[23]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Jurisprudence is clear that Section 53 also applies to indivisible
 penalties, such as dismissal, as long as there is clear proof, under 
specific legal and jurisprudential standards, that the facts of the case
 justify the mitigated, aggravated, or alternated penalty. 
 
Duque
 further instructs: 
  


 In appreciating the presence of mitigating, aggravating or 
alternative circumstances to a given case, two constitutional principles
 come into play which the Court is tasked to balance. The first is 
public accountability which requires the Court to consider the 
improvement of public service, and the preservation of the public's 
faith and confidence in the government by ensuring that only individuals
 who possess good moral character, integrity and competence are employed
 in the government service. The second relates to social justice which 
gives the Court discretionary leeway to lessen the harsh effects of the 
wrongdoing committed by an offender for equitable and humanitarian 
consideration.
[24]
 (Citation omitted) 




 Based on the foregoing, We affirm the factual findings of both the
 CSC and the CA that Bool was indeed guilty of gross neglect of duty. 
However, We deviate from the conclusion of the appellate court that 
Bool's length of service, good faith, and the fact that it was his first
 offense served to mitigate his liability. 
 Length of service is 
an alternative circumstance that can either be considered as mitigating 
or aggravating depending on the factual milieu of each case.
[25]

 It is "not a magic word that, once invoked, will automatically be 
considered as a mitigating circumstance in favor of the party invoking 
it."
[26]
 The Court has applied the alternative circumstance of length of service differently through the years: 
 In 
University of the Philippines v. Civil Service Commission
,
[27]

 the Court did not consider therein private respondent's length of 
service as a mitigating circumstance since it was her length of service,
 among others, that earned her the position she was in and through which
 she illicitly allowed her relatives to enjoy unmerited privileges, like
 an unwarranted diploma. In short, the length of service helped 
facilitate private respondent's commission of the offense.
 Length of service cannot also be considered as a mitigating circumstance when the offense committed is found to be serious. In 
Yuson v. Noel
,
[28]

 respondent judge was found guilty of abusing his office when he 
misappropriated the amount deposited with him in settlement of the 
judgment debt. The Court held that the mere length of his service for 10
 years could not mitigate the gravity of his offense or the penalty he 
deserves. 
 The above-cited cases, as applied to the case at bar, 
show that length of service cannot be considered as a mitigating 
circumstance when the length of respondent's service itself helped 
facilitate the commission of the offense, which is found to be grave or 
serious. 
 In this case, the Court agrees with the BSP that it was
 precisely because of Bool's length of service and experience that he 
was chosen as BSP's representative to France. It was in consideration of
 his extensive experience, special skills, and relevant expertise that 
he acquired by reason of his long years of service with the BSP that 
Bool was chosen for the highly technical work abroad.
[29]

 The CSC correctly held that the fact that Bool had been in the service 
for 33 years should have made him "more meticulous and prudent in 
discharging his responsibility."
[30]
 

 Moreover, the offense committed is so gross, grave, and serious in 
character as to endanger or threaten the public welfare. The CSC is 
correct in holding that the repercussions and the impact resulting from 
Bool's negligence in not detecting the error in former President 
Arroyo's surname are so great. The CSC held: 
  


 It is undeniable that with the [Bool]'s failure to detect the 
error in the surname of former President Arroyo in the 100-Piso bills 
printed by FCOF, the money spent for the production of the 100-Piso 
notes containing the misspelled surname of former President Arroyo was 
put to waste. Worse, the BSP, as well as former President Arroyo, became
 subjects of public ridicule and embarrassment. Such negligence of 
[Bool] could not be compared to the ordinary negligence which other 
employees may commit as to hold him liable only for Simple Neglect of 
Duty. As aptly explained by BSP, "[Bool] is not an ordinary person doing
 an ordinary task in an ordinary place and committing an ordinary 
mistake with ordinary effects. On the contrary, [Boo!] is the official 
representative of the BSP; he had gained a certain level of expertise in
 the printing of banknotes; he was chosen and accepted to be sent to the
 printer site in France to perform the specialized function of assuring 
the quality of the proof not of the 100-piso of the Republic of the 
Philippines."
[31]
 




 Moreover, 	Bool's	assertion 	of 	good 	faith 	does 	not 	persuade. Jurisprudence defines good faith in this wise: 
  


 Good faith is ordinarily used to describe that state of mind 
denoting honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry
;
 an honest intention to abstain from taking unconscientious advantage of
 another, even through technicalities of law, together with absence of 
all information, notice, or benefit or belief of facts which render [a] 
transaction unconscientious. In short, good faith is actually a question
 of intention. Although this is something internal, 
we can ascertain a
 person's intention not from his own protestation of good faith, which 
is self-serving, hut from evidence of his conduct and outward acts
.
[32]
 (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted) 




 In this case, the Court finds that Bool was not completely 
innocent In its Investigation Report, the BSP held that Bool was sent to
 France to "specifically assure; meaning, to make certain that the 
quality of printed proof sheets conforms to the prescribed 
specifications."
[33]
 Bool, 
however, admitted that he merely focused his attention on the color 
quality, registration, and design preference before actual production.
[34]
 He did not check the spelling of the former President's surname because such task, he alleged, did not belong to him.
[35]
 Clearly, Bool's conduct and outward acts negate his assertion of good faith. 

 Lastly, the defense of first offense does not apply. Section 52 (A) 
(2), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules and Section 46 (A) (2), Rule 10 of the
 Revised Rules clearly state that the grave offense of gross neglect of 
duty is punishable by dismissal, even if committed for the first time. 

 Incidentally, Bool's dismissal from service should not carry the 
accessory penalty of forfeiture of leave credits, if any, as imposed by 
the CSC, as these have already been earned and accrued to his benefit.
[36]
 
 
WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is 
GRANTED
. The January 21, 2013 Decision and the May 20, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP No. 123467 are

the penalty of dismissal from the service, with the accessory penalties 
of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and 
perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service, 
for gross neglect of duty, are hereby 
REINSTATED
 with the 
MODIFICATION
 that Bool is entitled to receive the monetary equivalent of his accrued leave credits, if any.
