PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Assailed in this petition for 
certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court are the Decision
[2]
 No. 2017-494 dated December 29, 2017 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated September 27, 2018 of the Commission on Audit (COA) which upheld the disallowances of the salary increases granted by petitioner Small Business Corporation (SBC) to its various personnel during the period from September 1, 2012 to September 30, 2014 in the aggregate amount of P4,489,002.09.   
      
The Facts
  
On June 1, 2009, acting pursuant to Republic Act No. (RA) 6977,
[4]
 as amended,
[5]
 the Board of Directors of SBC (SBC-BOD), a government financial institution (GFi),
[6]
 issued Board Resolution No. 1610
[7]
 approving the revision of its organizational structure,
[8]
 staffing pattern,
[9]
 qualification standards,
[10]
 and salary structure,
[11]
 
viz
.:    
BOARD RESOLUTION NO. 1610, SERIES OF 2009
              
APPROVAL OF REVISED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, STAFFING PATTERN, QUALIFICATION STANDARDS, AND SALARY STRUCTURE
     
"
RESOLVED:
 That in view of the incorporation of the changes as instructed by the Board and as favorably recommended by Management, 
the Revised Organizational Structure
 (Annex "A"), 
Revised Staffing Pattern
 (Annex "B"), and 
Revised Qualification Standards
 (Annex "C") be, as it is hereby approved. 
      
RESOLVED, FURTHER:
 That the proposed Salary Structure as recommended by the Consultant and Management 
unless otherwise recommended modified by the DTI Secretary
 be, as it is hereby approved." (Emphases supplied)
In compliance with administrative regulations,
[12]
 SBC then sought the confirmation of its revised salary structure from former Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Peter B. Favila who approved the same on February 8, 2010.
[13]
 
On September 8, 2010, then-President Benigno S. Aquino III issued Executive Order (EO) No. 7 imposing a 
"[m]oratorium on increases in the rates of salaries, and the grant of new increases in the rates of allowances, incentives[,] and other benefits"
 of government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) and GFIs, 
viz
.:    
SECTION 9.
 Moratorium on Increases in Salaries, Allowances, Incentives and Other Benefits
. â 
Moratorium on increases in the rates of salaries, and the grant of new increases in the rates of allowances, incentives and other benefits
, except salary adjustments pursuant to Executive Order No. 
[811]
 dated June 17, 2009 and Executive Order No. 900 dated June 23, 2010 are hereby imposed 
until specifically authorized by the President
. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
The moratorium notwithstanding, on October 28, 2011, the SBC-BOD issued Board Resolution No. 1863
[14]
 approving the guidelines and procedure for the administration of SBC's revised salary structure,
[15]
 which included the grant of step increments to qualified employees based on merit and length of service as assessed by a Performance Evaluation Review Committee (PERC), 
viz
.:    
              
BOARD RESOLUTION NO. 1863, SERIES OF 2011
        
GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF SBC'S SALARY STRUCTURE
"
RESOLVED:
 That as favorably endorsed by the Corporate Governance Committee, the 
Guidelines and Procedures on the Administration of SB Corporation's Salary Structure,
 the details of which are contained in the memo for the Board dated 19 October 2011 which is attached as Annex "A" and made an integral part hereof be, as it is 
hereby approved
." x x x x 
Step Increment

Definition
.
 Step increment is a lateral 
adjustment of an employee's basic salary from one salary step to the 
next higher
 salary step
. 
16. 
Types of step increment
.
 Step increment may be granted on the basis of merit or length of service.                                                                                                     
16.1
Merit
. Step increment based on merit (otherwise known as 
"merit increase"
) shall be given annually to deserving employees based on their individual performance and contribution to unit and corporate performance. The determination of officers and employees entitled to merit increase shall be based on the performance calibration as provided under Item 11 of this Office Order.
16.2
Length of Service.
 A 
1-step increment
 shall be given to employees for every three (3) years of continuous satisfactory service in their present positions: 
Provided
, that only those who have not received merit increase for the last 3 years shall be entitled to step increment based on length of service. 
[16]
(Emphases and underscoring supplied)
Accordingly, upon the PERC's recommendation, salary increases for qualified SBC personnel in the aggregate amount of 
P4,489,002.09
 were approved and correspondingly paid on various dates within the period from September 1, 2012 to September 30, 2014.
[17]
 
Meanwhile, on June 25, 2014, SBC wrote a letter
[18]
 to the Governance Commission for GOCCs
[19]
 (GCG) requesting the confirmation of its payment of salary increases for the year 2013. The request, however, was denied by the latter in a Memorandum
[20]
 dated July 8, 2014 on account of the continued effectivity of the moratorium imposed by Section 9 of EO No. 7.
[21]
 
Subsequently, on various dates in October 2014. the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor of the COA issued a total of 
six (6) notices of disallowance
[22]
 (subject disallowances) against the payment of the aforementioned salary increases for violation of EO No. 7, summarized by the COA as follows:

Total
            
P4,489,002.09
The persons held liable by the COA under the subject disallowances were the 
approving and certifying officers
 as well as the 
payee-recipients
 of the disallowed amounts. These include: (
a
) SBC President and Chief Operating Officer Benel P. Lagua and SBC Strategy, Policy and Communications Office Head Melvin E. Abanto, as approving officers;
[24]
 (
b
) Controllership Group Head Alfredo S. Dimaculangan, as certifying officer;
[25]
 and (
c
) various SBC personnel, as payee-recipients.
[26]
 
Aggrieved, SBC appealed
[27]
 to the Office of the Cluster Director of the COA's Corporate Government Sector (COA Cluster Director), arguing that the grants of salary increases were lawful since they were paid pursuant to its revised salary structure, which was duly approved by the DTI Secretary prior to the issuance of EO No. 7. In this regard, it claimed that EO No. 7 had been retroactively applied to the undue prejudice of the vested rights of the payees.
[28]
    
    
The Ruling of the COA Cluster Director
      
In the Decision
[29]
 No. 2015-007 dated May 18, 2015, the COA Cluster Director 
affirmed
 the subject disallowances.
[30]
 It held that the payment of salary increases contravened the clear directives of EO No. 7, and although the same were granted pursuant to a revised salary structure approved by the DTI Secretary, such approval was still subject to the President's ultimate authority pursuant to his executive power of control, as well as Congressional Joint Resolution (JR) No. 4,
[31]
 Section 59 of RA 9970,
[32]
 and Section 56
[33]
 of RA 10147.
[34]
 
Dissatisfied, SBC elevated the matter to the COA proper 
via
 a petition for review.
[35]
         
The Ruling of the COA Proper
In a Decision
[36]
 dated December 29, 2017, the COA Proper 
affirmed
 the ruling of the COA Cluster Director.
[37]
 
It held that the disbursements violated the imposed moratorium,
 finding that the disputed salary increases were 
implemented, approved, and granted during the effectivity. of EO No. 7.
 It pointed out that EO No. 7 was issued in accordance with Section 6
[38]
 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1597 and Section 9
[39]
 of Congressional JR No. 4.
[40]
 Undaunted, petitioner moved for reconsideration,
[41]
 which was denied in a Resolution
[42]
 dated September 27, 2018. Hence, the instant petition.      
The Issue Before the Court
  
The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the COA gravely abused its discretion in affirming the subject disallowances of salary increases granted by SBC to various personnel during the period from September 1, 2012 to September 30, 2014. SBC argues that the grants of the disputed salary increases were valid because: (
a
) they were paid pursuant to its revised salary structure which was approved prior to the issuance of EO No. 7; (
b
) it is empowered by RA 6977, as amended, to fix the salaries of its personnel; and (
c
) even assuming that the payment of salary increases were properly disallowed, the approving and certifying officers, as well as the respective recipients thereof, cannot be held civilly liable since the amounts were paid and received in good faith.
[43]
    
      
The Court's Ruling
      
The petition is without merit.      
I.
The COA is constitutionally endowed with enough latitude to determine, prevent, and disallow the illegal, irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures of government funds. The exercise of this audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check and balance system inherent in our form of government.
[44]
 
Corollary thereto, the Court has generally sustained the COA's decisions or resolutions in deference to its expertise in the implementation of the laws it has been entrusted to enforce. It is only when the COA has clearly acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction that the Court may intervene to correct its decisions or resolutions.
[45]
 
In this case, the Court finds that the COA did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in affirming the propriety of the subject disallowances relative to the salary increases of the SBC personnel pursuant to its revised salary structure providing for step increments. 
As the COA correctly ruled, the disputed salary increases were illegally disbursed in violation of the moratorium imposed under EO No. 7, Section 9 of which reads: 
SECTION 9. 
Moratorium on Increases in Salaries, Allowances, Incentives and Other Benefits
. â 
Moratorium on 
increases
 in the 
rates of salaries,
 and the grant of new increases in the rates of allowances, incentives and other benefits,
 
except salary adjustments pursuant to Executive Order No. 811 dated June 17, 2009 and Executive Order No. 900 dated June 23, 2010
 are hereby imposed 
until specifically authorized by the President
. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
As explained in its whereas clauses, the moratorium was intended "to strengthen the supervision over the compensation levels of GOCCs and GFIs, in order to control the grant of excessive salaries, allowances, incentives[,] and other benefits."
[46]
 
At this juncture, it should be clarified that although SBC's revised salary structure was approved on February 8, 2010, which was prior to the issuance of EO No. 7 on September 8, 2010, the implementation of the same commenced only on October 28, 2011 when SBC issued procedural rules and guidelines for its administration. Moreover, the recipients of the salary increases were only determined much later upon the recommendation of the PERC and the increases themselves were only approved and actually granted between the period of September 1, 2012 to September 30, 2014. Thus, the COA properly observed that the disallowed salary increases still fall within the ambit of the executive order 
since they were only implemented, approved, and actually granted during its effectivity
.
At any rate, there is nothing in EO No. 7 which exempts previous revisions of a GOCC/GFI's salary structure from the increase moratorium. As worded, the only exception appears to be salary adjustments pursuant to EO No. 811
[47]
 and EO No. 900,
[48]
 which was not, however, shown to obtain in this case.      
II.
Further, it should be borne in mind that notwithstanding prior laws enabling certain GOCCs/GFIs to fix their own salary schemes (as in the case of SBC), such power is still subject to the standards laid down by applicable laws,
[49]
 which, among others, grants the President the ultimate authority to approve salary increases of GOCCs/GFIs exempt from the salary standardization law.
[50]
 Under RA 10149,
[51]
 the GCG, which is attached to the Office of the President,
[52]
 is authorized
[53]
 to fix the compensation frameworks of all GOCCs (including GFIs
[54]
), as a rule, in order "to prevent or deter the granting of unconscionable and excessive remuneration packages."
[55]
 As held in 
Galicto v. Aquino III
:
[56]
      
With the enactment of the GOCC Governance Act of 2011, the 
President is now authorized to fix the compensation framework of GOCCs and 
GFIs
.
  
x x x x  
As may be gleaned from these provisions, 
the new law amended R.A. No. 7875 and other laws that enabled certain GOCCs and GFIs to fix their own compensation frameworks
; the law now authorizes the President to fix the compensation and position classification system for all GOCCs and GFIs, as well as other entities covered by the law. 
xxx   
x x x x   
This is the present situation here. 
Congress, [through] R.A. No. 10149, has expressly empowered the President to establish the compensation systems of GOCCs and 
GFIs.
 x x x
[57]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
Thus, the authority granted to the SBC-BOD by RA 6977, as amended, to fix its own salary structure, remains subject to the provisions of RA 10149. In fact, as the COA aptly noted, SBC itself even recognized the GCG's authority over its compensation framework, as evinced by its own letter dated June 25, 2014 to the latter requesting confirmation of its grant of salary increases. 
Besides, it is well to note that the issue of the propriety of the subject disallowances had already been conclusively settled in the related case of 
SBC v. COA
,
[58]
 docketed as 
G.R. No. 230628
 
(October 2017 SBC Case)
, which also involved the same issue between the same parties in the case at bar. In the said case, the Court, through a Decision dated October 3, 2017, affirmed 
Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 14-001-401000-(13) dated August 27, 2014
 issued by the COA against salary increases authorized and paid by SBC to various personnel pursuant to its revised salary structure during the period from September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2014 for being violative of the moratorium imposed by EO No. 7. In so ruling, the Court declared that "[i]t is the 
date of the 
actual
 giving of the Increased salary rate
 that is material insofar as determining whether the moratorium imposed by EO No. 7 is applicable or not[,]" 
"irrespective of when the GOCC's/GFI's salary structure was approved[,]"
 
viz
.:     
EO No. 7 was issued on September 8, 2010. 
The merit increases, meanwhile, were granted only on April 12, 2013, and were applied to salaries earned from the period September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2014. During this period, the moratorium established in EO No. 7 was already in effect since September 8, 2010.
 
A plain reading of the wording in Sec. 9 of EO No. 7 would reveal that the clear directive is to halt the grant of additional salaries and allowances to employees and officers of GOCCs.
 x x x    
x x x x   
[SBC] argues that, as applied to the grant of merit increases to the five officers, COA gave EO No. 7 retroactive effect. [SBC] argues that its salary structure had been in existence since June 1, 2009, well before (he imposition of the moratorium. x x x  
x x x x
What [SBC] does not dispute, however, is that 
it was only on April 12, 2013 that it 
actually granted
 merit increases to the five officers involved in the present case. 
At that time, EO No. 7 was already in effect
. The moratorium on the grant of increased salary rates was already in full force and effect.
 
x x x x  
There is no question that EO No. 7 docs not provide for any retroactive application. However, [SBC's] interpretation of which acts are prohibited by the moratorium runs contrary to the plain wording of EO No. 7 when it imposed the moratorium on "increases in the rates of salaries, and the grant of new increases in the rates of allowances, incentives and other benefits." 
The E.O. did not prohibit merely the grant of increased salary rates in corporate salary structures; it also intended to 
halt the actual giving 
of increased salary rates.
 
x x x x  
The issue of retroactivity, as posited by the [SBC], is not actually one of retroactive application, but an issue of which particular acts are prohibited. 
The Court holds that the moratorium is imposed on the 
actual grant
 of increased salary rates, allowances, incentives, and other benefits, regardless of the date of approval of the salary structure, 
irrespective of when the COCC's/GFI's salary structure was approved.
 There is no merit, therefore, in [SBC's] argument that COA effectively gave EO No. 7 retroactive effect. 
It is the date of the actual giving of the increased salary rate that is material insofar as determining whether the moratorium imposed by EO No. 7 is applicable or not
.
[59]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)   
With the issue regarding the propriety of the disallowances already settled, the Court now examines the civil liability of the individuals directed to return the amounts pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence. Notably, while the principle of conclusiveness of judgment
[60]
 applies anent the issue of the subject disallowance's propriety, considering that 
(a)
 the present case and the 
October 2017 SBC Case
 stemmed from disbursements made pursuant to the'same issuance
[61]
 (
i.e.
, the implementing guidelines approved under Board Resolution No. 1863), and 
(b)
 as between them, there are substantially identical parties (
i.e.
, SBC personnel on the one hand and the COA on the other) and issues raised (
i.e.
, the propriety of the grant of salary increases notwithstanding the issuance of EO No. 7), the 
separate issue on civil liability
 must still be determined if only to account for the different factual peculiarities attending the individual participation of the persons to be held civilly liable herein in accordance with existing case law on the subject.
[62]
    
III.
The prevailing jurisprudence on the civil liability of persons made to return disallowed personnel incentives and benefits is 
Madera v. COA
[63]
 
(Madera)
. In 
Madera
, the prescribed Rules on Return are as follows:    
E. The Rules on Return
 
In view of the foregoing discussion, the Court pronounces:      
          
If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.           
If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules on return are as follows:              
                
a. Approving and certifying officers who acted in good faith, in regular performance of official functions, and with the diligence of a good father of the family are not civilly liable to return consistent with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.                 
Approving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarity liable to return only the net disallowed amount, which, as discussed herein, excludes amounts excused under the following sections 2c and 2d.                 
Recipients â whether approving or certifying officers or mere passive recipients â are liable to return the disallowed amounts respectively received by them, unless they are able to show that the amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered.                 
The Court may likewise excuse the return of recipients based on undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other 
bona fide
 exceptions as it may determine on a case to case basis.
[64]
Based on the 
Madera
 Rules on Return, the public officers ordinarily held liable under disallowance cases involving personnel incentives and benefits are classified as either (1) an approving/authorizing officer or (2) a payee-recipient. Their civil liabilities to return are correspondingly governed by distinct legal nuances under two basic frameworks of law.
[65]
To expound, when a public officer is to be held civilly liable in his or her capacity as an approving/authorizing officer, the liability is to be viewed from the public accountability framework of the Administrative Code. This is because the civil liability is rooted on the errant performance of the public officer's official functions, particularly in terms of approving/authorizing the unlawful expenditure.
[66]
Approving/certifying officers of the disallowed amounts are not automatically held liable for their return. Consistent with Section 38 (1),
[67]
Chapter 9, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987, a clear showing of bad faith, malice, or gross negligence must first be established in order to hold them civilly liable as public officers for the illegal disbursements of public funds. Absent such clear showing, they are presumed to be in good faith, and therefore, not civilly liable in their official capacities.
Once the existence of bad faith, malice, or gross negligence as contemplated is clearly established, the liability of approving/certifying officers to return the disallowed amounts based on an unlawful expenditure is 
solidary
. This solidary liability is found in Section 43, Chapter 5, Book VI of the Administrative Code of 1987: 
Section 43. 
Liability for Illegal Expenditures
. â Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in violation of the provisions of this Code or of the general and special provisions contained in the annual General or other Appropriations Act shall be void. Every payment made in violation of 
said provisions
 shall be illegal and 
every official or employee 
authorizing or making such payment
, or 
taking part therein
, and every person receiving such payment shall be 
jointly and severally liable
 to the Government for the 
full amount so paid or received.
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
On the other hand, when a public officer is to be held civilly liable riot in his or her capacity as an approving/certifying officer but merely as a 
payee-recipient
 of the disallowed amount, the liability is to be viewed not from the public accountability framework of the Administrative Code but instead, from the lens of unjust enrichment and the principle of 
solutio indebiti
 under a purely civil law framework.
In this relation, case law illumines that when the civil obligation is sourced from 
solutio indebiti
,
 good faith is inconsequential
.
[68]
 Accordingly, previous rulings absolving passive recipients solely and automatically based on their good faith contravene the true legal import of a 
solutio indebiti
 obligation and, hence, pursuant to the promulgation of 
Madera
, have now been abandoned. Thus, as it stands, 
the general rule is that recipients, regardless of their good faith, are civilly liable to return the disallowed amounts they had individually received on the basis of 
solutio indebiti
.
This notwithstanding, the Court in 
Madera
 also recognized certain exceptions to the general rule on return. Bearing in mind its underlying premise, which is "the ancient principle that no one shall enrich himself unjustly at the expense of an other,"
[69]
 
solutio indebiti
 finds no application where recipients were not unjustly enriched
[70]
 at the expense of the government. Under the 
Madera
 Rules on Return, the exceptions pertain to disallowed personnel incentives and benefits which are either: (1) 
genuinely given in consideration of services rendered
 (
Rule 2c
 of the 
Madera
 Rules); or (2) excused by the Court to be returned on the basis of 
undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other 
bona fide
 exceptions as may be determined on a case-to-case basis
 (
Rule 2d
 of the 
Madera
 Rules) 
As a supplement to 
Madera
, the Court, in the later case of 
Abellanosa v. COA
[71]
 
(Abellanosa)
, clarified the proper conditions for the application of the foregoing exceptions so as to prevent their indiscriminate and loose invocation to the prejudice of the government. As discerned by the Court: 
[T]hese refined parameters are meant to prevent the indiscriminate and loose invocation of Rule 2c of the Madera Rules on Return which may virtually result in the practical inability of the government to recover. To stress, Rule 2c as well as Rule 2d should remain true to their nature as exceptional scenarios; they should not be haphazardly applied as an excuse for non-return, else they effectively override the general rule which, again, is to return disallowed public expenditures.
    Specifically, in order to quality under the Rule 2c exception (
i.e.
, 
genuinely given in consideration of services rendered
), the following requisites must concur:    
(
a
) the personnel incentive or benefit has 
proper basis in law
 but is only disallowed due to 
irregularities that are merely procedural in nature
; and       
(
b
) the personnel incentive or benefit must have a 
clear, direct, and reasonable connection
 to the actual performance of the payee-recipient's official work and functions for which the benefit or incentive was intended as further compensation.
[72]
 (Emphases supplied)
 
The first requisite makes clear that the exception under Rule 2c was not intended to cover compensation not authorized by law or those granted against salary standardization laws.
[73]
 Thus, amounts excused under the Rule 2c exception should be understood to be limited to disbursements 
adequately supported by factual and legal basis, but were nonetheless validly disallowed by the COA on account of 
procedural infirmities
.
Aside from having proper basis in law, the disallowed incentive or benefit, to qualify under the Rule 2c exception, must also have a 
clear, direct, and reasonable connection
 to the actual performance of the payee-recipient's official work and functions.
 As discussed in 
Abellanosa
, for a benefit or incentive to be considered as "genuinely given," not only does it need to have an ostensible statutory/legal cover, but there must also be actual work performed and that the benefit or incentive bears a clear, direct, and reasonable relation to the performance of such official work or functions.
Distinct from Rule 2c, Rule 2d of the 
Madera
 Rules on Return provides for another exception to excuse return, namely, 
disallowed amounts excused by the Court to be returned on the basis of undue prejudice, social justice considerations, and other bona fide exceptions as may be determined on a case-to-case basis
. While Rule 2d is couched in broader language as compared to Rule 2c, 
Abellanosa
 elucidates that the exception may only be invoked in 
bona fide
 instances where the Court is strongly impelled to prevent a clear inequity arising from a directive to return
. Therefore, it is only in 
highly exceptional circumstances
, after taking into account all relevant factors
 (such as the nature and purpose of the disbursement and its underlying conditions) that the civil liability to return may be excused. For indeed, it was never the Court's intention for Rules 2c and 2d of 
Madera
 to be a jurisprudential loophole that would cause the government fiscal leakage and debilitating loss.
Notably, the application of Rules 2c and/or 2d in a particular case has a 
direct bearing on the civil liability of the erring 
approving/certifying officers
 under Section 38, in relation to Section 43, of the Administrative Code. In 
Madera
, the Court explained that 
when recipients are excused to return disallowed amounts for the reason that they were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered, or for some other 
bona fide
 exception determined by the Court on a case to case basis, the 
erring approving/certifying officers' solidary obligation
 for the disallowed amount is 
net of the amounts excused to be returned by the recipients (net disallowed amount
)
.
[74]
 The justifiable exclusion of these amounts signals that no proper loss should be recognized in favor of the government, and thus, reduces the total amount to be returned to the extent corresponding to such exclusions.
In this case, the Court finds that the approving and certifying officers of the disallowed salary increases clearly acted with gross negligence in authorizing or taking part in the authorization of their illegal disbursements. As earlier explained, Section 9 of EO No. 7 clearly imposed a moratorium against 
"increases in the rates of salaries, and the grant of new increases in the rates of allowances, incentives and other benefits"
 of GOCC/GFI personnel. Further, the provision makes no exception as to salary increases stemming from a prior reorganization of a GOCC/GFI's salary structure. Therefore, the approving/certifying officers identified under the subject disallowances cannot be said to have acted in good faith when, despite the effectivity of EO No. 7, they still proceeded to implement, approve, and grant the disallowed amounts. Hence, pursuant to Sections 38 and 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, they are 
solidarity liable
 for the return of the disallowed amounts in accordance with and as respectively indicated under each notice of disallowance.
Meanwhile, anent the liability of the payee-recipients, the Court finds no reason to excuse their return of the disallowed amounts under the above-discussed exceptions of the 
Madera
 rules. For one, since the disbursements lack proper basis in law and were not disallowed based on mere procedural infirmities, the salary increases cannot be excused as amounts genuinely given in consideration of services rendered under Rule 2c of the 
Madera
 rules. Neither do the records of the case furnish any clear equitable basis justifying the payees' retention of the amounts on exceptional considerations of undue prejudice, social justice, or other 
bona fide
 grounds. Thus, following the general rule on return, each of the payee-recipients, regardless of their good faith, are 
individually liable
 for the return of the amounts they respectively received on the basis of 
solutio indebiti
.
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
DISMISSED
. The Decision No. 2017-494 dated December 29, 2017 and the Resolution dated September 27, 2018 rendered by the Commission on Audit are hereby 
AFFIRMED
. Pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, the approving and certifying officers identified in Notice of Disallowance Nos. 14-002-401000-(12), 14-003-401000-(12), 14-004-401000-03), 14-005-401000-03), 14-006-401000-(13), and 14-007-401000-(13) are held solidarity liable for the return of the disallowed amounts in accordance with and as respectively indicated under each notice of disallowance. Meanwhile, the payee-recipients are held individually liable for the return of the disallowed amounts they respectively received.
