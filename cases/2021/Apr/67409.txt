DECISION




GAERLAN, J.:


Before this Court is a petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to annul and set aside the Decision
[2]
 dated September 26, 2016, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 105049, and its Resolution
[3]

 dated December 28, 2016, denying the motion for reconsideration 
thereof. The assailed issuances granted the appeal and reversed and set 
aside the 
Judgment
 dated December 10, 2014, of the Regional Tried Court (RTC) of Batangas City, Branch 84.



The Antecedent Facts



Petitioners Ana de Joya and Ciriaco de Joya, Lerma R. Castillo and Mario
 Castillo, Spouses Domingo Cordero and Leoncia Cordero, and Eufronio 
Cordero and Tarcila Cordero (petitioners) are the registered owners of 
two parcels of agricultural land - Lot Nos. 5 and 6, consisting of an 
area of 140,327 square meters and 31,465 square meters, respectively 
(subject properties). Both are located at Barrio Concordia, Alitagtag, 
Batangas, and are covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 
T-64767.
[4]




By virtue of a Special Power of Attorney dated January 23, 1992, and a 
Pangkalahatang Gawad ng Kapangyarihang Hindi Natitinag

 dated February 5, 1996, petitoners granted respondent Francisco P. 
Madlangbayan (respondent Madlangbayan) the authority to sell the subject
 properties.
[5]




Sometime during the first half of April 1996, respondent Madlangbayan 
received a counter-offer from respondents Spouses Ma. Florita and 
Roiando Dalida, Spouses Guillermo and Rosalinda Cano, and spouses 
Rosendo and Isabelita Ramos (respondents Dalida, et al.). The 
counter-offer was rejected by the petitioners in a letter
[6]
 dated April 10, 1996, 
viz
.:



Bauan, Batangas


April 10, 1996


Rolando Z. Dalida 
Chairman of the Board
Rural Bank of Bauan Inc.
Bauan, Batangas


My dear Mr. Dalida,



I regret to inform you that after conferring with my client, the owner 
of the parcel of land I have been authorized to sell, they could not 
agree on almost all of your counter offer, particularly on the amount of
 the total consideration and the terms of payment. This is so because 
they are in great need of cash and the amount of SEVENTEEN MILLION 
(P17,000,000.00) PESOS is non-negotiable. However, if you could give a 
better offer I could agree to give you the right to buy the property 
after May 31, 1996.


Very truly yours,


(signed)

Francisco P. Madlangbayan

Subsequent thereto, petitioners alleged that former Mayor Rod A. 
Macalintal in a meeting with petitioner Eufronio Cordero (petitioner 
Eufronio), agreed to accept their offer to sell the subject properties 
at the price of P100.00 per square meter. The agreement however did not 
push thru due to a conflict in respondent Madlangbayan's commission. The
 latter supposedly claimed a share of P13,600,000.00 commission out of 
the P17,000,000.00 purchase price.
[7]




Due to the disagreement, the petitioners executed a 
Revocation of Special Power of Attorney and General Power of Attorney
 on May 3, 1996, rescinding respondent Madlangbayan's authority over the subject properties.
[8]





On June 5, 1996, the petitioners sent a letter to respondent 
Madlangbayan, demanding, in view of the revocation of the power of 
attorney, for the latter to surrender the owner's duplicate certificate 
of title.
[9]
 As the demand 
remained unheeded, the petitioners filed an Affidavit of Adverse Claim 
on TCT No. 64767 before the Registry of Deeds of Batangas on July 1, 
1997.
[10]





On July 14, 1997, a complaint for revocation of authority was filed by 
the petitioners against respondent Madlangbayan. In response, the latter
 replied that the authority could no longer be revoked as he had already
 sold the property pursuant to the power of attorney given him.
[11]



Petitioners filed a 
Supplemental Complaint/Petition
 dated January
 26, 1998, impleading as defendants herein respondents Dalida, et al. 
for entering into a conspiracy with respondent Madlangbayan in executing
 a fake 
Deed of Absolute Sale
, dated April 8, 1996, over the subject properties.
[12]







On March 21, 2000, petitioners filed a 
Second Supplemental Complaint/Petition
 praying for additional damages on account of the lost owner's duplicate certificate of title over the subject properties.
[13]




During trial, the petitioners presented evidence which tend to prove 
that they had rejected the initial proposal submitted to them for the 
sale of the subject properties and that respondent Madlangbayan's 
authority to sell the subject properties had been revoked due to a 
misunderstanding in the latter's commission.
[14]




Further, petitioners averred that on a separate occasion, on November 8,
 1998, petitioner Eufronio discovered a letter dated April 10, 1996, 
addressed to respondent Rolando Dalida in which the subject properties 
were offered to the latter for a non-negotiable amount of 
P17,000,000.00. Thereafter, petitioner Eufronio was surprised to learn 
that the subject properties were sold to respondent spouses Dalida for 
the amount of P10,000,000.00 by virtue of a 
Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated April 8, 1996.
[15]




For their part, respondents Dalida, et al. claim that sometime in 1995, 
respondent Madlangbayan, armed with a special power of attorney, offered
 the subject properties to them for the amount of P17,000,000.00. 
Respondents Dalida, et al. made a counter offer of P10,000 000.00 which 
was accepted. Consequently, with the execution of a 
Deed of Absolute Sale

 dated April 8, 1996, the purchase price of P10,000,000.00 was deposited
 in respondent Madlangbayan's account in the Rural Bank of Bauan. The 
owner's duplicate copy of title over the subject properties was then 
given to respondents Dalida, et al.
[16]




After trial, the RTC rendered its Decision
[17]
 on August 8, 2002, which found respondents Dalida, et al., to be buyers in good faith, thereby ruling as follows:




WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of 
[respondent Madlangbayan and respondents Dalida et al.] upholding the 
validity of the Special Powers of Attorneys (Exhibits "B" and "C") and 
the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exhibit "K").


The amount in escrow deposit on (sic.) Ten Million Pesos 
(Php10,000,000.00) with the Rural Bank of Bauan shall be paid and 
delivered to the [petitioners] or their authorized representatives by 
the
[respondents] and the said bank.


The counterclaims are likewise DISMISSED sans evidence of bad faith in filing this case. No pronouncement as to cost.


SO ORDERED.
[18]


The petitioners filed an appeal before the CA, docketed as CA G.R. CV 
No. 77685. While the appeal was pending, the petitioners filed a 
Motion for New Trial (On the Ground of Newly Discovered Evidence)
. In its Resolution
[19]
 dated December 13, 2005, the CA granted the motion, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE, finding the instant "MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL (On the
 Ground of Newly Discovered Evidence)" to be impressed with merit, the 
same s hereby GRANTED. Guided by Section 4, Rule 53 and Sections 3 and 
6, Rule 37 of the Revised Rules of Court, the assailed 8 August 2002 
Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 84, is SET
 ASIDE. Said court is ordered to HOLD a trial 
de novo
 within a 
non-extendible period of thirty (30) days from notice. This Court's 
Judicial Records Division (Civil Records Section) is hereby DIRECTED to 
REMAND the entire records of this case to the court 
a quo
.


SO ORDERED.
[20]

In the course of the new trial, the petitioners presented evidence which
 tend to establish the circumstances attending Certificate of Time 
Deposit (CTD) No. 7290 dated April 10, 1996, in the name of respondent 
Madlangbayan. The proceedings likewise revealed that the subject 
properties had been sold by respondents Dalida, et al. to respondent 
spouses Chollie Go and Renato Go (respondents Go, et al.) by virtue of a
 Deed of Absolute Sale, dated April 24, 2003, and that the owner's 
duplicate certificate of title is now in the possession of respondent 
Chollie's brother, Renato Go.
[21]




With the new information, petitioners filed a 
Third Supplemental Complaint
 dated November 16, 2006, impleading respondents Go, et al. in the case.
[22]












On March 8, 2007, petitioners filed a 
Motion for Summary Judgment/Judgement on the Pleadings
. Despite respondents Go, et al.'s opposition, the RTC rendered its 
Decision
 (
New
)
[23]

 dated June 27, 2007. The RTC found that the price of the sale was 
simulated and unpaid; and that the records are bereft of evidence to 
prove good faith on the part of respondents Dalida, et al. Thus, the RTC
 upheld the rights of the petitioners over the subject properties. The 
dispositive portion of the Decision reads:



WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants:


Ordering the [respondents], namely Renato Go, Chollie Go, Venecio H.
 Magnayee, Cristela Salcedo-Magnaye and Jayson Magnaye to vacate and 
deliver to [petitioners] the two (2) parcels of land in question 
including improvements, both covered by TCT No. T-64767 issued by the 
Register of Deeds for the Province of Batangas being the property 
located in Barrio Concordia, Municipality of Alitagtag, Province of 
Batangas. x x x


To pay lost or unrealized income (rental): for the 14.0327 hectares and 3.1465 hectares x x x


To pay the interest of 6% per annum on the respective amounts 
jointly by all [respondents] from the date of this decision until fully 
paid;


To pay moral damages jointly by all [respondents] in the amount of P300,000.00; and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages;


To pay attorney's fee in the amount of P215,573.00 which was 
incurred by the [petitioners] from January 1998 to July 2002 to be paid 
jointly by the [respondents Dalida, et al.] only;


To pay attorney's fee in the amount of P348,515.00 which was 
the attorney's fee incurred by the [petitioners] from April 2003 to 
April 2007 to be paid jointly by [respondents Dalida, et al.] and 
[respondents Go et al.] and;


Costs[s] of suit.


SO ORDERED.
[24]


Motion for Reconsideration of the June 27, 2007 Decision of the RTC 
having been denied, respondents Go, et al. filed an appeal before the 
CA. The case was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 90502.
[25]






On December 17, 2009, the CA rendered its Decision
[26]
 finding the appeal meritorious, thus:




WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is GRANTED. 
The decision dated June 27, 2007 assailed herein is SET ASIDE. The case,
 with its entire records, is ordered REMANDED to the trial court for 
continuation or proper proceedings on the merits which must be conducted
 with dispatch.


SO ORDERED.
[27]


On January 5, 2010, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution
[28]
 dated July 23, 2010.
[29]




In accordance with the December 17, 2009 Decision of the CA, the RTC 
issued an Order setting the case for continuation of trial on October 
25, 2012.
[30]




In the course of the proceedings in the court below, respondents Go, et 
al. presented the testimony of respondent Jayson Magnaye. Magnaye 
testified that at the time of sale, a certain Diosdado Andal leased a 
portion of the subject properties. After the sale, respondents Go, et 
al. took possession and introduced improvements on the subject 
properties. However, on February 14, 2008, petitioners forcibly took the
 subject properties.
[31]




On December 10, 2014, the RTC rendered its Judgment
[32]
 in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents. The dispositive portion of which reads:



WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds that a 
preponderance of evidence exists in favor of the [Petitioners] and 
against the [Respondents]. Judgment is hereby rendered, as follows:


1) The Special Power of Attorney dated January 23, 1992 and General 
Power of Attorney dated February 5, 1996 executed in favor of 
[Respondent] Francisco Madlangbayan are annulled, revoked and 
terminated, for all intents and purposes;





2) The Deed of Sale dated April 8, 1996 executed by [Respondent] 
Francisco Madlangbayan and [Respondents] Spouses Rolando Dalida and Ma. 
Florita Dalida, Spouses George Guilet and Conchita Guilet, Spouses 
Guillermo Cano and Rosalinda Cano, and Spouses Rosenda Ramos and 
Isabelita Ramos is void 
ab initio
 for Jack of consideration;


3) The subsequent Deed of Sale dated January 2003 between [Respondents 
Dalida, et al.] and [Respondents Go et al.] is null and void as the 
spring cannot rise higher than its source. Accordingly, [Respondents 
Dalida, et al.] are DIRECTED to return to [Respondents Go, et al.] the 
purchase price paid in the amount of Eight Million Two Hundred 
Fifty-Thousand Pesos (Php8,250,000.00) with appropriate legal interest 
from time of sale until fully paid.


4) [Respondents Go, et al.] did not acquire the subject lots in good 
faith and for value; as builders in bad faith, they lose the 
improvements they built without right to indemnity.


5) The [Petitioners] are ORDERED to choose one of the following options:
 (a) to appropriate for themselves the improvements made without 
indemnifying [Respondents Go, et al.) for the value of the materials; or
 (b) to recover portions of the subject lot and demand that [Respondents
 Go, et al.] demolish whatever improvements they had made therein, so as
 to return the said portions to their former condition, at the expense 
of the latter, or (c) to surrender the said portions to [Respondents Go,
 et al.] and compel the latter to reimburse the [Petitioners] for the 
purchase price, plus appropriate interest; and to manifest to this Court
 the option chosen, furnishing copies thereof to all the [Respondents] 
within five (5) days from receipt hereof.


6) In view of the finding that [Respondents Go, et al.] are not 
purchasers in good faith, and depending on the option chosen by the 
[Petitioners], as enumerated in paragraph 5 hereof;


(a) In case the [Petitioners] choose the option under paragraph 5(a), 
[Respondents Go, et al.] are ORDERED to vacate the premises and 
surrender possession of the improvement and subject lot to the 
[Petitioners], if the said [Respondents Go, et al.] still exercise 
possession over said lot, within ten (10) days from receipt of the 
option exercised by the [Petitioners].


(b) In case the [Petitioners] choose the option under paragraph 5(b), 
[Respondents Go, et al.] are ORDERED to demolish whatever improvements 
it has made on the said portions, so as to return the same to their 
former condition, at its own expense and to surrender to the 
[Petitioners] the possession over the subject lots, if the said 
[Respondents Go et al.] still exercise possession over the said lot, 
within ten (10) days from receipt of the option exercised by the 
[Petitioners].


(c) In case the [Petitioners] choose the option under paragraph 5(c), 
[Respondents Go, et al.] are ORDERED to pay the rPetitioners] for the 
subject lot to be pegged at the current fair market va!ue, plus 
appropriate interest.
 




7) All of the [Respondents] are ORDERED to solidarily pay the 
[Petitioners] the unrealized or lost rental income in the amount of 
Twelve Thousand Pesos (Php12,000) a year for one parcel of 14.0327 
hectares, or One Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand Three Hundred Ninety-Two 
Pesos and Forty Centavos (Php168,392.40) per annum, to be computed from 
June 5, 2003 until February 14, 2008.


8) [Respondents Madlangbayan and Dalida, et al.] shall be jointly liable
 to pay the unrealized or lost rental income in the amount of Twelve 
Thousand Pesos (Php12,000) a year for the parcel of land with the area 
of 3.1465 hecaters, or Thirty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty-Eight 
Pesos (Php37,758.00) per annum, to be computed from June 5, 2003 until 
February 14, 2008.


9) All of the [Respondents] are ORDERED to solidarity pay the 
[Petitioners] the amount of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php300,000.00)
 as moral damages, One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00) as 
exemplary damages, and Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php400,000) as 
attorney's fees;


10) All of the [Respondents'] counterclaims are DISMISSED for lack of 
merit. [Respondents Go, et al.'s] cross-claim against [co-respondent 
Madlangbayan] for whatever loss and damage they may suffer is likewise 
DENIED for lack of sufficient evidentiary basis.


SO ORDERED.
[33]


Respondents Go, et al. filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order dated March 31, 2015.
[34]
 Thus, respondents Go, et al. filed an appeal before the CA.



On September 26, 2016, the CA rendered the herein assailed Decision
[35]
 which found as follows:



WHEREFORE, the instant Appeal is GRANTED. The 
Judgment

 of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 84, in Civil Case 
No. 4887 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. [Petitioners] are hereby 
ordered to vacate the subject property and deliver possession thereof to
 [Respondents] Chollie Magnaye-Go, Cristeta S. Magnaye and Jayson 
Magnaye.


SO ORDERED.
[36]


In so ruling, the CA held that the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated 
April 8, 1996, is valid as all the elements of a valid contract of sale 
is present. Having been executed by respondent Madlangbayan prior to the
 revocation of the power of attorney, the CA held that his act of 
conveying the property is a valid source of obligation to bind the 
petitioners, thus, the element of consent is satisfied. With respect to 
the subject matter, the CA noted that the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
 
dated April 8, 1996 describes in sufficient detail the subject 
properties. Finally, as to the purchase price, the CA found that the 
Deed is supported by a purchase price of P10,000,000.00, paid in full to
 respondent Madlangbayan through CTD No. 7290 dated April 10, 1996 and 
placed in escrow with Bauan Rural Bank.
[37]




In holding that the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
, dated April 8, 1996, 
is supported by adequate consideration, the CA adjudged irrelevant the 
fact that CTD No. 7290, dated April 10, 1996, is not included in the 
inventory of outstanding deposit liabilities of Bauan Rural Bank as of 
its closure date on May 9, 2003, or that the Philippine Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (PDIC) certified that as of the date they took 
over the bank on May 13, 2003, no document was found to validate the CTD
 account. The CA concluded that, notwithstanding, there is no sufficient
 proof to rule that that CTD No. 7290 dated April 10, 1996 does not 
exist as the PDIC was only able to look into available records provided 
to them by the rural bank.
[38]



Considering that the transfer of the subject properties through the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
,
 dated April 8, 1996, is valid, the CA ruled that the subsequent sale 
between respondents Dalida and respondents Go, et al. is also valid. 
That a Notice of 
Lis Pendens
, dated July 14, 1997, is annotated 
on the subject titles at the time of sale to respondents Go, et al. does
 not render the transfer invalid but merely subjects the same dependent 
upon the outcome of litigation.
[39]




Motion for Reconsideration of the said Decision having been similarly denied by the CA in its Resolution
[40]
 dated December 28, 2016, the petitioners filed the instant Petition for review on 
certiorari
.



In support of the instant petition, the petitioners raise the following errors committed by the CA:




  I.


THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN A SALE TRANSACTION WAS 
CONSUMMATED ON 8 APRIL 1996 AS EVIDENCED BY THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE OF
 THE SAME DATE BEFORE PETITIONERS REVOKED THE POWER OF ATTORNEY GRANTED 
TO MADLANGBAYAN; OTHERWISE STATED, THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED 
WHEN IT DID NOT FIND THAT THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE DATED 8 APRIL 1996 
WAS ABSOLUTELY SIMULATED.



II.



THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT DISREGARDED THE NUMEROUS 
JUDICIAL AND EXTRAJUDICIAL ADMISSIONS BY THE RESPONDENTS' 
PREDECESSORS-IN-INTEREST, THE DALIDAS AND MADLANGBAYAN ESTABLISH THAT 
THERE WAS NO CONSUMMATED SALE TRANSACTION AS OF 8 APRIL 1996 CONTRARY TO
 THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE OF SAID DATE.



III.



THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN, WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE OF EITHER 
THE EXISTENCE OF CERTIFICATE OF TIME DEPOSIT NO. 7290 OR OF THE ACTUAL 
CASH PAID TO THE PETITIONERS, IT FOUND THAT THERE WAS VALUABLE 
CONSIDERATION FOR THE ALLEGED CONSUMMATED SALE.





IV.



THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT APPLY THE BEST 
EVIDENCE RULE AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRESENTATION OF SECONDARY 
EVIDENCE BUT MERELY ASSUMED AS ESTABLISHED FACT, THE EXISTENCE OF CTD 
NO. 7290.



V.



THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO APPRECIATE AS 
APPLICABLE. THE PRESUMPTION THAT EVIDENCE WILLFULLY SUPPRESSED WOULD BE 
ADVERSE IF PRODUCED WITH RESPECT TO THE REFUSAL AND FAILURE OF THE 
DALIDAS, MADLANGBAYAN AND THE RURAL BANK OF BAUAN TO DEPOSIT IN COURT OR
 THE LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES THE ALLEGED PIO MILLION CONSIDERATION 
FOR THE ALLEGED CONSUMMATED SALE TRANSACTION.



VI.



THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT CTD NO. 7290 DID 
EXIST BASED ON A MERE UNSUBSTANTIATED CONJECTURE DEVOID OF ANY 
EVIDENTIARY BASIS.
[41]

Succinctly, the instant petition rests on the determination of the issue
 of whether or not a valid contract of sale was entered into involving 
the subject properties.




Ruling of the Court



Petitioners submit that the CA erred in relying upon the existence of the 
Deed of Absolute Sale

 dated April 8, 1996. They claim that the purported contract of sale is 
simulated citing, in the main, in support thereof: the failure of 
respondent Madlangbayan and respondents Dalida, et al. to reach an 
agreement as evidenced by a letter dated April 10, 1996, and want of 
evidence of payment constituting valuable consideration.
[42]



In its Comment,
[43]
 respondents Go, et al. aver that the 
Deed of Absolute Sale

 dated April 8, 1996, is valid as all the elements of a contract of sale
 is present. They assert that the law and the rules presume the 
existence of a sufficient consideration in every contract and the burden
 is upon the petitioners to prove otherwise. In the case at bar, 
respondents Go, et al. claim that the petitioners failed to overcome 
such presumption and show that CTD No. 7290 does not exist. Further, 
respondents Go, et al. argue that there was no actual receipt by the 
petitioners of the consideration does not render the contract 
inexistent. At most, the same constitutes a breach of contract that may 
be the subject of an action for specific performance.
[44]




The petition is 
meritorious
.




At the outset, it bears to state that the issue presented invites the 
Court to determine factual issues that is generally beyond the province 
of a petition for review. Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only 
questions of law should be raised in a petition for review on 
certiorari
.
 However, the rule admits of jurisprudentially established exceptions as
 when the findings of fact of the RTC and the CA are cont1icting, 
similar to the case at bar.
[45]




On its face, the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated April 8, 1996, 
involving the subject properties appears to be valid and supported by an
 adequate consideration, but the attendant circumstances indicate 
otherwise.



There are two veritable legal presumptions that support the validity of a
 Deed of Sale: (1) that it was the result of a fair and regular private 
transaction, and (2) that there was sufficient consideration for the 
contract. However, these presumptions merely infer 
prima facie
 the transaction's validity and may be rebutted by proof to the contrary.
[46]

 Thus, jurisprudence instructs that even the existence of a signed 
document purporting to be a contract of sale does not preclude the 
finding that the contract is invalid when the evidence shows that there 
was no meeting of minds between the seller and the buyer.
[47]




In this controversy, these presumptions are negated by evidence and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated April 8, 1996.



The first presumption is contravened by evidence that the contract of sale is simulated.
[48]




A contract to be valid, requires for its existence the presence of three
 essential elements: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object 
certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of 
the obligation which is established.
[49]




The absence of any of these elements renders the contract void. In 
particular, when an apparent contract exists but the consent is wanting,
 the contract is absolutely simulated.
[50]

 This is because in absolute simulation, the colorable contract is not 
desired to produce legal effect or in any way alter the judicial 
relation of the parties.
[51]
 
Otherwise put, in absolute simulation, there appears to be a contract 
but it has no substance as the parties have no intention to be bound by 
it.
[52]





In a simulated deed of sale for instance, the contract may appear to be 
supported by a cause or consideration, but the purchase price has never 
been actually paid. In which case, the deed of sale has no legal effect 
and any transfer certificate of title which has been issued as a result 
thereof must be cancelled. Likewise, the principle of 
in pari delicto
 does not apply.
[53]
 The parties may recover from each other what they may have given under the contract.
[54]





In contrast, in a relative simulation, the parties conceal their true agreement.
[55]

 In a relative simulation, the parties may still be bound by their 
agreement when the enforcement of the contract does not prejudice third 
persons and is not intended for any purpose that is contrary to law, 
morals, good customs, public order or public policy.
[56]




In a case for declaration of nullity of an instrument for being 
simulated, the burden is upon the person who impugns its regularity and 
validity
[57]
 to establish the 
contract's inexistence by preponderance of evidence. This is because the
 law presumes that a transaction has been fair and regular.



Preponderance of evidence means the probability of the truth. It is the 
weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side. It 
is evidence that is more convincing or worthier of belief than that 
which is offered in opposition thereto. Preponderance of evidence is 
synonymous to "greater weight of evidence" or "greater weight of 
credible evidence."
[58]



In civil cases, this burden of proof always rests upon the plaintiff. 
However, when in the course of trial, the plaintiff successfully makes 
out a 
prima facie
 case in his favor, "the burden of evidence 
shifts to the defendant to controvert the plaintiff's prima facie case, 
otherwise, a verdict must be returned in favor of the plaintiff."
[59]




After a careful scrutiny of the records of the case at bar, the Court 
finds that the petitioners, as plaintiffs, were able to discharge this 
burden. The petitioners were able to establish by preponderance of 
evidence that no contract of sale involving the subject properties has 
been perfected and that the 
Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated April 8, 1996 is absolutely simulated.



The primary consideration in determining the true nature of a contract 
is the intention of the parties. Such that when a conflict exists 
between the express terms of an agreement and the evident intention of 
the parties, the latter prevails. Thus, such intention is judged not 
only from the words of the contract, but also from the contemporaneous 
and subsequent acts of the contracting parties.
[60]



Respondent Madlangbayan is an agent of the petitioners, vested with the 
power to negotiate the sale of the subject properties. The agency is 
created and evidenced by one general power of attorney and one special 
power of attorney, pursuant to which, respondent Madlangbayan dealt with
 potential buyers respondents Dalida, et al. In April 1996, he acted as 
agent of the petitioners when he received respondent Dalida, et al.'s 
offer to purchase the subject properties. Respondent Madlangbayan also 
acted in representation of the petitioners when he rejected the offer 
placed on April 10, 1996. Thus, there is no contest that at the time 
respondent Madlangbayan negotiated with respondents Dalida, et al. he 
was still possessed with the requisite authority to deal with the 
subject properties. Nonetheless, at that point, it was clear that no 
contract was perfected as the parties failed to agree on the purchase 
price. In order "[t]o produce an agreement, the offer must be certain 
and the acceptance timely and absolute."
[61]




Consent, as an essential element of a contract of sale is manifested by 
"the meeting of the offer and the acceptance of the thing and the cause,
 which are to constitute the contract."
[62]

 The contract of sale is perfected with the union of the contracting 
parties' minds upon the thing that is the object of the contract and 
upon the price which constitutes the consideration therefor.
[63]




To convert the offer into a contract, the acceptance must be identical 
in all respects with that of the offer. Where a party sets a different 
purchase price than the amount of the original offer, the acceptance is 
qualified. In which case, a perfected contract would have arisen only if
 the other party accepts the counter-offer. Otherwise stated, any 
modification or variation from an offer annuls such offer and does not 
generate consent.
[64]




The tenor of respondent Madlangbayan's letter to respondents Dalida, et 
al. is telling that the parties did not pass the negotiation state:




Bauan, Batangas


April 10, 1996


Rolando Z. Dalida 
Chairman of the Board
Rural Bank of Bauan Inc.
Bauan, Batangas


My dear Mr. Dalida,









I regret to inform you that after conferring with my client, the owner 
of the parcel of land I have been authorized to sell, they could not 
agree on almost all of your counter offer, particularly on the amount of
 the total consideration and the terms of payment. This is so because 
they are in great need of cash and the amount of SEVENTEEN MILLION PESOS
 is non-negotiable. However, if you could give a better offer I could 
agree to give you the right to buy the property after May 31, 1996.


Very truly yours, 


(signed)


Francisco P. Madlangbayan


Simply put, the parties failed to come into an agreement with the rejection of respondent Dalida, et al.'s counter offer.



The Court cannot simply brush aside the fact that the letter of 
respondent Madlangbayan rejecting respondent Dalida, et al.'s counter 
offer was dated two days after the date of 
Deed of Absolute Sale
.
 The respondents failed to offer an explanation to justify the same. 
When made to explain, respondent Madlangbayan merely opined: "[b]ut as 
far as my Deed of Absolute Sale is concerned, that is the date when the 
Deed of Sale has been notarized."
[65]




The respondents having failed to offer evidence sufficient to justify 
why the rejection of the offer with the same parties came after the 
supposed execution of the Deed of Sale, it is more in accord with logic 
and ordinary human experience to conclude that the Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated April 8, 1996 is absolutely simulated. This conclusion is 
particularly supported by the fact that the said Deed is tainted with 
various irregularities which cloud its validity.



On its face, Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 8, 1996 states that it 
was notarized by Notary Public Atty. Henry Adasa on the same date it was
 executed, with the following notarial details: Doc. No. 350, Page No. 
70, Book No. XII, Series of 1996.
[66]

 However, it is not disputed that the same does not appear in Atty. 
Adasa's Notarial Registry for the year 1996. Atty. Adasa claims that the
 failure is by mere inadvertence. Regardless of the reason for such 
omission, the failure of Atty. Adasa to register the subject Deed of 
Absolute Sale casts doubt on the authenticity of the document. 
Registration of the notarized document in the notarial registry is basic
 requirement in the notarial process. The notarial registry is a record 
of the notary public's official acts. Acknowledged documents and 
instruments recorded in it are considered public documents. A document or instrument which does not appear in the 
notarial records or without a copy of it therein, suggests that the 
document or instrument was not really notarized.
[67]

 Without registration, a document or instrument while signed by the 
Notary Public cannot be treated as duly notarized. It cannot be treated 
as a public document
[68]
 and 
as such, is not entitled to the presumption of regularity. The document 
or instrument does not have for its benefit that which is due to public 
documents, that is that genuineness and due execution need not be 
proved. Irregular notarization reduces the evidentiary value of a 
document to a private document which requires proof of its due execution
 and authenticity to be admissible as evidence.
[69]




While, on its own, the absence of registration does not invalidate the 
Deed of Sale, considering however the presence of the letter dated April
 10, 1996 rejecting respondent Dalida, et al.'s counter offer, the case 
yields in favor of the petitioner.




Interestingly, it was only in response to the Complaint for revocation 
filed on July 14, 1997, that respondent Madlangbayan brought to the 
attention of the petitioner's that the property had been sold and as a 
result, the power of attorney could no longer be revoked.
[70]

 Relevant to the sale of the subject properties, a Deed of Absolute Sale
 dated April 8, 1996, for the amount of P10,000,000.00 was presented by 
respondents Dalida, et al.




The authority given to respondent Madlangbayan was expressly revoked in an instrument dated May 3, 1996.
[71]

 This would have been sufficient to revoke the agency, but as the 
owner's duplicate TCT remained with respondent Madlangbayan, the 
petitioners filed an Affidavit of adverse claim on July 1, 1997. On July
 14, 1997, the petitioners filed a case for annulment of respondent 
Madlangbayan's authority. Simultaneously, petitioners also filed a 
notice of 
lis pendens
 which was annotated on the TCT of the subject properties.
[72]





A contract of agency is extinguished by its revocation.
[73]

 As agency is a personal contract of representation that is based on the
 trust and confidence reposed by the principal upon the agent,
[74]
 it may be revoked by the principal at will.
[75]
 The withdrawal of such authority by the principal may either be express or implied.
[76]




From the revocation of the agency on May 3, 1996, therefore, respondent 
Madlangbayan no longer had any authority over the subject properties. 
Had there really been a perfected contract of sale, respondent 
Madlangbayan should have informed the petitioners at this point. That 
respondent Madlangbayan failed to inform the petitioners of the supposed
 sale of the subject properties to respondents Dalida, et al. lends 
further doubts to the contentious Deed of Sale.



Likewise, the gist of the letter dated April 10, 1996, tells us that 
while respondent Madlangbayan is vested with the authority to sell the 
property, he may only do so for the amount approved by the petitioners, 
that is P17,000,000.00. Any amount below the asking price would have to 
be consulted with and approved by the petitioners. Respondent 
Madlangbayan, on his own, cannot enter in a contract below the initial 
price set by the petitioners. In this regard, the Court cannot help but 
doubt why in the case at bar, no prior and timely information was given 
to the petitioners regarding the sale. For one, the Deed of Absolute 
Sale was for P10,000,000.00, an amount below the ceiling set by the 
petitioners. As aforestated, respondent Madlangbayan also had every 
opportunity to notify the petitioners that he had successfully 
negotiated a sale. In particular, in the natural course of things, the 
immediate reaction would be to inform the petitioners of the supposed 
sale of the subject properties after being informed of the revocation of
 his power of attorneys effective May 3, 1996, if indeed one has been 
entered into. Nonetheless, in this case, the sale was brought to the 
attention of the petitioners in respondent Madlangbayan's Answer. Even 
so, at that point, respondent Madlangbayan did not present a copy of the
 supposed Deed of Absolute Sale he had executed with respondents Dalida,
 et al. He, instead, presented two documents denominated as 
Memorandum of Agreement
,
 both of which are undated and are not notarized, stating as 
consideration an amount lower than that indicated in the Deed of 
Absolute Sale, 
i.e.
, P7,000,000.00. The respondents failed to provide the reason for the inconsistency between these instruments.



A contract of agency is personal, representative, and derivative in 
nature. The authority of the agent to act emanates from the powers 
granted to him by his principal. The agent is the extension of the 
principal only insofar as acts performed by him that are within the 
scope of his authority.
[77]
 By
 way of exception, a principal may be bound by the agent's acts 
performed beyond the scope of his authority, in case of express or 
implied ratification. Ratification, however, demands that the principal 
has full knowledge of all the material facts or should have knowledge 
thereof in view of circumstances which invites "a reasonably prudent 
man" to conduct an inquiry.
[78]

 In this case, petitioners deny knowledge of the sale of the subject 
properties; respondent Madlangbayan does not controvert such submission.
 Thus, there is no room for ratification in this case.



In view of the foregoing, therefore, it is of no moment that the 
petitioners made an admission of the existence of two escrow agreements.
 The fact remains that there is no valid and perfected contract of sale 
involving the subject properties in this case.



In the same vein, respondents Dalida, et al. cannot be considered as 
buyers in good faith. Primarily, they were aware that they were dealing 
with respondent Madlangbayan as an agent of the petitioners. Therefore, 
they were bound at their peril, in that in dealing with the agent, it 
was incumbent upon them to ascertain the nature and extent of such 
agent's authority.
[79]
 
Moreover, they were privy to and did not controvert the contents of 
respondent Madlangbayan's letter dated April 10, 1996. Respondents also 
failed to directly address why the letter rejecting their counter-offer 
was dated later than the Deed of Sale; instead they merely deflected the
 issue by saying that respondent Madlangbayan never admitted that the 
"rejection of the offer for P17,000,000.00" happened after the Deed of 
Absolute Sale had been executed.
[80]
 Remarkably, no explanation was offered to rationalize the situation.



Finally, the Court sustains the findings of the CA that respondents Go, 
et al. cannot, as well, be considered as buyers in good faith 
considering that at the time the Deed of Sale was executed in their 
favor, there was an existing Notice of 
Lis Pendens
 dated July 14,
 1997, on the TCT of the subject properties. Furthermore, respondents 
Go, et al. were likewise aware of the existence of 
Kasunduan sa Pag-upa ng Lupa
 dated June 5, 2003, over the subject properties executed between the petitioners and one Diosdado Andal.
[81]




Moreover, a simulated sale and all transactions subsequent thereto are void and conveys no title.
[82]
 Consequently, the Deed of Sale between respondents Go, et al. and respondents Dalida, et al. is void.



In addition, as successors-in-interest, respondents Go, et al. stand 
exactly in the shoes of their predecessor-in-interest, respondents 
Dalida, et al. The latter, as buyers in a simulated sale acquired no 
right of ownership over the subject properties and had nothing to 
transfer to respondents Go, et al.
[83]




There being no valid transfer of the subject properties, the petitioners remained to be the owners thereof.



As a final note, with the admission of Atty. Adasa that out of 
inadvertence he failed to register the subject Deed of Absolute Sale, 
the Court deems it appropriate to issue him a stern warning that a 
repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more 
severely. Time and again, the Court has constantly reminded Notaries 
Public that their solemn duties are imbued with public interest and are 
not to be taken lightly.
[84]
 
Hence, they must "observe with utmost care and fidelity the basic 
requirements in the performance of their duties; otherwise, the 
confidence of the public in the integrity of the notarized deeds will be
 undermined."
