INTING, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]

 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Rules) filed by the Heirs of Jose 
Malit, Sr., namely: Jose Malit, Jr., Edilberto Malit, Loreta 
Malit-Sumauang, Cecilia Malit-Timbang, Maria Luz Malit-Felice, and 
Teresita Malit-Paule (collectively, Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr.) assailing 
the Decision
[2]
 dated May 24, 2012 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated February 27, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 
115584. In the assailed issuances, the CA dismissed the Heirs of Jose 
Malit, Sr.'s Petition
[4]
 under Rule 65 of the Rules for being the wrong remedy to assail the Orders dated April 26, 2010
[5]
 and July 6, 2010
[6]
 of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Dinalupihan, Bataan which dismissed Civil Case No. DH-1171-08.
 
The Antecedents


 The Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. filed a Complaint
[7]

 for Partition and Damages (Complaint) against Elsa Malit-Almero, Myrna 
Malit-Alvarez, Edelwina Malit-Clarete, Zenaida Malit-Gatdula, Elisa 
Malit-Songco, Lilian M. Malit, Feliciana Malit-Paule, Feliciano M. 
Malit, Agustin M. Malit, Diosdado M. Malit, Orlando M. Malit, and 
Marianita D. Asuncion (collectively, Heirs of Jesus Malit) before the 
RTC. 
 Plaintiffs therein, the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr., alleged as follows: 
 
First
, Jose Malit, Sr. and Jesus Malit are the sons of Andres Malit.
[8]
 
Second
,
 the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. and the Heirs of Jesus Malit are: (a) the 
respective children of Jose Sr. and Jesus; (b) first-degree cousins; and
 (c) co-owners of Lot 980, a 16.8-hectare parcel of land situated in 
Hermosa, Bataan (subject property).
[9]
 
Third
, the parties 
orally agreed

 that the Heirs of Jesus Malit would facilitate the subject property's 
titling and registration. After which, the parties would extrajudicially
 partition the subject property between and among them.
[10]
 
Fourth
,
 however, in contravention of the aforementioned oral agreement, the 
Heirs of Jesus Malit subdivided the subject property into nine lots and 
caused the issuance of individual Original Certificates of Title (OCT) 
under their (Heirs of Jesus Malit) names only.
[11]
 
Fifth
, the Heirs of Jesus Malit have refused to honor the oral agreement.
[12]
 
 In their Answer with Affirmative Defense,
[13]

 the Heirs of Jesus Malit sought to dismiss the Complaint on the 
following grounds: "(a) lack of cause of action and/or the cause of 
action is barred by prior judgment; (b) forum-shopping; and (c) that [a]
 condition precedent for filing the claim has not been complied with[.]"
[14]
 
Ruling of RTC


 In an Order
[15]
 dated April 26, 2010, the RTC dismissed the Complaint. It explained as follows: 
first
,
 the issue presented by the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. was already settled
 in a prior judgment in Civil Case No. 4816 (cancellation of title and 
reversion of subject property) which had already become final and 
executory.
[16]
 
Second
, 
the subject property, which was previously acquired by the Heirs of 
Jesus Malit through a free patent, cannot be the subject of a partition.
[17]
 Thus, the defendants (Heirs of Jesus Malit) did not commit acts that may have given rise to a cause of action for partition.
[18]
 
Third
,
 the rule is that all plaintiffs must sign the certification against 
forum shopping accompanying their initiatory pleading. However, only 
Loreta Malit-Sumauang signed the Complaint's verification/certification.
[19]
 
Fourth
,
 there was no showing that the parties, being members of the same 
family, exerted earnest efforts to compromise the matter prior to the 
filing of the Complaint. This violated the condition precedent 
requirement enunciated in Article 222 of the Civil Code of the 
Philippines.
[20]
 
 The RTC also denied
[21]
 the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr.'s subsequent motion for reconsideration.

 Aggrieved, the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. filed a Rule 65 petition before
 the CA assailing the RTC's order of dismissal. Alleging that the RTC 
committed grave abuse, they sought to annul and set aside the Order 
dated April 26, 2010 which dismissed Civil Case No. DH-1171-08 due to 
lack of cause of action, forum shopping, and noncompliance with a 
condition precedent.
[22]
 
Ruling of the CA


 In the assailed Decision, the CA dismissed the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr.'s petition. 

 It ruled that the RTC's dismissal was a final order and not 
interlocutory. Thus, the proper remedy to assail it would have been 
through an 
appeal
, not a 
certiorari 
petition.
[23]
 The availability of the remedy of appeal proscribes the filing of a 
certiorari
 petition. The remedies are mutually exclusive.
[24]
 In any case, the CA noted that the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. received the RTC Order denying their Motion for Reconsideration
[25]
 on July 6, 2010.
[26]
 Still, they filed their CA petition only on August 26, 2010.
[27]

 Thus, even if the CA treats their petition as an ordinary appeal in the
 interest of justice, their chosen recourse was filed out of time or 
beyond the 15-day reglementary period to appeal,
[28]
 rendering the assailed RTC order final and executory.
[29]
 Furthermore, their allegations attribute merely errors of judgment, not acts of grave abuse.
[30]
 This shows that they filed the petition to substitute a lost appeal.
[31]
 On Motion for Reconsideration,
[32]
 the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. insisted that the assailed order of dismissal was 
without prejudice
.
[33]
 Thus, the remedy of appeal was not available to them.
[34]
 Granting 
arguendo
 that their 
certiorari

 petition was not the proper remedy, procedural "rule[s] should not be 
strictly enforced x x x because their petition is genuinely 
meritorious."
[35]


 However, in denying the motion, the CA maintained that the RTCs 
assailed order finally disposed of Civil Case No. DH-1171-08. Thus, the 
ruling was appealable
[36]
 and may not be the subject of 
certiorari
.
 At any rate, whether the RTC's dismissal was with or without prejudice,
 it is clear that the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. sought redress from the 
CA belatedly. Thus, the right to appeal had become unavailable.
[37]
 "[A]n order dismissing a case without prejudice is 
a final order if no appeal therefrom is timely filed
 x x x a party who wishes to reinstate the case has no other remedy but to file a new complaint."
[38]
 However, at the time of its resolution, the aggrieved parties have not yet refiled their complaint.
[39]


 Hence, the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. filed the present petition. 
 
Issue


 The sole issue in the present case is whether the CA erred in 
dismissing the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr.'s petition for being the wrong 
remedy or, in any case, being filed out of time. 
 
The Courts Ruling


 The petition lacks merit. 





Nature of the RTC's order of dismissal
 






A complaint's dismissal shall not bar the plaintiff from refiling the
 same action or claim, except when his claim was dismissed for being 
barred by a 
prior judgment or prescription, extinguished
, or rendered 
unenforceable
 under the provisions of the statute of frauds.
[40]


 To recall, the RTC dismissed the Complaint in Civil Case No. 
DH-1171-08 for: (1) being barred by a prior judgment (Civil Case No. 
4816); (2) failure to state a cause of action (
i.e
., for 
partition); (3) lack of verification/certification against forum 
shopping; and (4) failure to comply with a condition precedent (
i.e
., earnest efforts to arrive at a compromise among family members). 
 Among the grounds cited, the RTC's termination of the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr.'s Complaint 
in view of the prior judgment in Civil Case No. 4816
 made the dismissal one 
with prejudice
,
 as provided under the Rules. While a dismissal of this nature prohibits
 the refiling of the case, the Rules, nonetheless, accords the aggrieved
 party the right to appeal therefrom.
[41]


 The availability of appeal as a remedy to a dismissal 
with prejudice
 disqualifies the aggrieved party from availing of 
certiorari
 proceedings, these two being mutually exclusive.
[42]
 It is already settled that the proper recourse from the trial court's order of dismissal 
with prejudice
 is an ordinary appeal under Rule 41 of the Rules.
[43]


 Thus, the CA correctly dismissed the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr.'s petition for 
certiorari
 for being the wrong remedy. 





Reglementary periods to appeal and file a petition for certiorari
 






Verily, courts have on occasion relaxed the application of procedural
 rules. However, the CA also found that the Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. 
filed their petition 51 days
[44]

 after receipt of the RTC Order denying their Motion for 
Reconsideration. Thus, even if the CA would relax the rules and treat 
their 
certiorari
 petition as an ordinary appeal, it would still be infirm for being filed beyond the 15-day appeal period.
[45]


 In these lights, the Court echoes the CA's observation: that the
 Heirs of Jose Malit, Sr. filed a Rule 65 petition as an afterthought, 
having already lost their right to appeal. Certainly, the flawed manner 
with which they invoked their chosen remedy does not warrant a 
relaxation of procedural rules. 
 
WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is 
DENIED
. The Decision dated May 24, 2012 and Resolution dated February 27, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 115584 are 
AFFIRMED
