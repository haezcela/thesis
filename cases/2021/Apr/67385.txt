THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 219340, April 28, 2021 ]


COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. STANDARD INSURANCE CO., INC., RESPONDENT.

R E S O L U T I O N




HERNANDO, J.:


For Our Resolution is the Motion for Reconsideration
[1]
 of the November 7, 2018 Decision
[2]
 which granted the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[3]
 of petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), which sought the reversal of the May 8, 2015 Decision
[4]
 and the July 10, 2015 Order
[5]
 in Civil Case No. 14-1330 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 66 of Makati City.
  
 The RTC Decision and RTC Order granted respondent Standard 
Insurance Co. Inc.'s (Standard Insurance) Petition for Declaratory 
Relief and permanently enjoined the CIR and its agents from implementing
 Sections 108 and 184 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) 
against Standard Insurance until Congress enacts House Bill No. 3235 (HB
 3235) entitled 
An Act Rationalizing the Taxes Imposed on Non-Life Insurance Policies
 into law.
[6]
 
The Antecedent Facts:

 Petitioner CIR is the head of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), a 
government agency tasked with the power and duty of assessing and 
collecting all national internal revenue taxes, fees, and charges among 
others.
[7]
 Respondent Standard
 Insurance is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under 
Philippine laws and engaged in the business of non-life insurance.
[8]

 On February 13, 2014, respondent received from the BIR a Preliminary 
Assessment Notice (PAN) regarding its liability amounting to 
P377,038,679.55 arising from a deficiency in the payment of documentary 
stamp taxes (DST) for taxable year 2011.
[9]
 Standard Insurance contested the PAN
[10]
 but the CIR nonetheless sent it a formal letter of demand.
[11]
 Although respondent requested reconsideration,
[12]

 it received on December 4, 2014 the Final Decision on Disputed 
Assessment (FDDA) dated November 25, 2014, declaring its liability for 
the DST deficiency, including interest and compromise penalty, totaling 
P418,830,567.46.
[13]
 On 
December 11, 2014, it sought reconsideration of the FDDA, and objected 
to the tax imposed pursuant to Section 184 of the NIRC as violative of 
the constitutional limitations on taxation.
[14]

 Meanwhile, respondent also received a demand for the payment of its 
deficiency income tax, value-added tax (VAT), premium tax, DST, expanded
 withholding tax, and fringe benefit tax for taxable year 2012 which 
respondent protested in its letter dated December 10, 2014 on the ground
 that the VAT rate and DST rate imposed on premiums charged on non-life 
property insurance pursuant to Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC are 
violative of the constitutional limitations on taxation.
[15]
 Respondent also received a demand for payment of deficiency DST for taxable year 2013.
[16]

 On December 19, 2014, Standard Insurance commenced Civil Case No. 
14-1330 in the RTC with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining 
order (TRO) and a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) for the judicial 
determination of the constitutionality of Sections 108 and 184 of the 
NIRC with respect to the taxes charged against the non-life insurance 
companies.
[17]
 In its 
Petition, the respondent contended that the facts of the case must be 
appreciated in light of the effectivity of Republic Act No. 10001 (RA 
10001) entitled 
An Act Reducing the Taxes on Life Insurance Policies
,
 whereby the tax rate for life insurance premiums was reduced from 5% to
 2%; and the pendency of deliberations on House Bill 3235, whereby an 
equal treatment for both life and non-life companies was being sought as
 a response to the supposed inequality generated by the enactment of RA 
10001.
[18]
 
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:


 On December 23, 2014, the RTC issued a TRO enjoining the BIR, 
its agents, representatives, assignees, or any persons acting for and in
 its behalf from implementing the provisions of the NIRC adverted to 
with respect to the FDDA for the respondent's taxable year 2011, and to 
the pending assessments for taxable years 2012 and 2013.
[19]

 On January 13, 2015, the RTC issued an Order granting the application 
for WPI of respondent and thereby ordering the CIR and his/her 
representatives to refrain from further proceeding with the 
implementation or enforcement of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC 
until further orders
, upon posting by respondent of the requisite bond.
[20]

 Thereafter, the RTC issued the WPI on January 14, 2015 and an Order on 
February 18, 2015: (a) dismissing the CIR's motion to set hearing for 
dismissal of the case on the ground that the issues contained therein 
can be resolved simultaneously with the main case; (b) denying the CIR's
 motion for reconsideration to the RTC's issuance of the WPI on January 
13, 2015; and (c) denying Standard Insurance's motion to declare 
petitioner in default.
[21]
 The RTC Orders dated January 13, 2015 and February 18, 2015 thereafter became the subject of a Petition for 
Certiorari
 filed with the Court of Appeals (CA).

 On May 8, 2015, the RTC rendered its Decision holding that although 
taxes were self-assessing, the tax system merely created liability on 
the part of the taxpayers who still retained the right to contest the 
particular application of the tax laws; and holding that the exercise of
 such right to contest was not considered a breach of the provision 
itself as to deter the action for declaratory relief, and decreed 
thusly.
[22]
 The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:
  


 
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the respondent, its 
agents, representatives, or any persons acting on its behalf is hereby 
permanently enjoined from proceeding with the implementation or 
enforcement of Sections 108 and 184 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code against petitioner Standard Insurance Co., Inc. until the Congress 
shall have enacted and passed into law House Bill No. 3235 in conformity
 with the provisions of the Constitution.


 
SO ORDERED.
[23]




 The CIR moved for reconsideration which the trial court denied for lack of merit in its July 10, 2015 Order.
[24]
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
 On April 27, 2014, petitioner filed a Petition for 
Certiorari

 before the CA pursuant to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court to (a) set 
aside the Orders dated January 13, 2015 and February 18, 2015 of the RTC
 granting respondent's application for issuance of a WPI and subsequent 
denial of the MR; and (b) dissolve the WPI dated 14 January 2015.
[25]

 The Petition, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 140403, was later 
dismissed by the appellate court in its October 30, 2015 Resolution for 
failure of the petitioner to comply with the CA's August 19, 2015 
Resolution to submit copies of pertinent pleadings.
[26]


Assailed Decision of the Court:


 On September 7, 2015, petitioner filed a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari

 before Us praying for the reversal and setting aside of the RTC 
Decision and RTC Order on the following grounds: (a) The RTC erred in 
taking cognizance of the case because a Petition for Declaratory Relief 
is not applicable to contest tax assessments and the petition is fatally
 defective for failing to satisfy the basic requisites under Rule 63 of 
the Rules of Court; (b) The RTC erred in adjudging Sections 108 and 184 
of the NIRC as violative of the equal protection clause; (c) The RTC 
gravely erred in granting injunctive relief in favor of respondent, the 
same being specifically prohibited by Section 218 of the NIRC and for 
having been issued despite the absence of a clear legal right; and (d) 
The RTC erred in granting the relief provided in the RTC Decision since 
the resultant remedy falls outside the purview of an action for 
declaratory relief and it is violative of the rule that judicial 
decisions must finally determine the rights, obligations, and 
responsibilities of parties.
[27]
 On November 7, 2018, We rendered the assailed Decision granting the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
.
[28]

 We ruled that the RTC grossly erred and acted without jurisdiction in 
giving due course to the petition for declaratory relief and permanently
 enjoining the enforcement of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC, in 
violation of Section 218 of the NIRC and Section 11 of Republic Act No. 
1125. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:
  


 
WHEREFORE
, the Court
 GRANTS
 the petition for review on 
certiorari
; 
ANNULS
 and 
SETS ASIDE
 the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 14-1330 on May 8, 2015 by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 66, in Makati City; 
DISMISSES
 Civil Case No. 14-1330 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction; 
QUASHES

 the writ of preliminary injunction issued against the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue in Civil Case No. 14-1330 for being issued without 
jurisdiction; and 
ORDERS
 the respondent to pay the costs of suit.
[29]




 We opined that respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief failed
 to comply with the requisites for the said action, since the subject 
provisions, 
i.e
., Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC have been 
infringed by respondent prior to the institution of the action. 
Moreover, respondent's allegation that it could be rendered insolvent 
through the imposition of taxes imposed by Sections 108 and 184 of the 
NIRC did not result in the action for declaratory relief becoming an 
actual controversy ripe for judicial determination.
 Hence, this Motion for Reconsideration.

 Respondent argues that the Court erred in not dismissing the Petition 
outright on the ground that petitioner committed deliberate and willful 
commission of forum shopping, and that the issues raised in the Petition
 are factual in nature and are barred under Rule 45 of the Rules of 
Court. Moreover, respondent alleges that the RTC has jurisdiction to 
take cognizance of respondent's action for declaratory relief and that 
the latter has fully satisfied the essential requisites of a petition 
for declaratory relief under Rule 63 of the Rules of the Court.
[30]

 Lastly, the respondent argues that the Court erred in disregarding its 
clear and unmistakable right to equal protection to uniformity and 
equitability of taxation, in relying in Section 218 of the NIRC and in 
not finding that the RTC has jurisdiction to issue injunctive writs and 
the latter lie against the implementation of unconstitutional statutes, 
and in finding that the RTC violated the rule that judicial decisions 
must finally determine the rights, obligations and responsibilities of 
the parties.
[31]
 
Issues


 To dispose of the instant case, the following issues must be resolved: 
 
First
,
 whether the Petition must be dismissed on the ground of forum shopping 
and/or non-compliance with the certification against forum shopping 
requirement; 
 
Second
, whether the Petition must be dismissed on the ground of raising issues of fact, which are barred under a Rule 45 petition; 
 
Third
,
 whether the RTC had the jurisdiction to take cognizance of respondent's
 petition for declaratory relief and issue injunctive relief against the
 implementation of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC; and
 
Fourth
,
 whether the RTC should have dismissed respondent's petition for 
declaratory relief for failure to comply with the essential requisites 
of a petition for declaratory relief under Rule 63 of the Rules of 
Court. 
 We resolve to deny the motion for reconsideration for lack of merit. 
  




Petitioner is not guilty 
of forum shopping and has complied with the certification against nonÂ­ 
forum shopping requirement under Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules of 
Court.
 






Forum shopping exists when, as a result of an adverse decision in 
one forum, or in anticipation thereof, a party seeks a favorable opinion
 in another forum through means other than appeal or 
certiorari
. There is forum shopping when the elements of
 litis pendencia
 are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to 
res judicata

 in another. They are as follows: (a) identity of parties, or at least 
such parties that represent the same interests in both actions, (b) 
identity of rights or causes of action, and (c) identity of reliefs 
sought.
[32]


 In sum, both actions must involve the same transaction, same 
essential facts and circumstances and must raise identical causes of 
action, subject matter, and issues. Clearly, forum shopping does not 
exist where different orders were questioned, two distinct causes of 
action and issues were raised, and two objectives were sought.
[33]

 Under the foregoing test, we find that petitioner did not commit forum 
shopping in filing the instant Petition during the pendency of CA-G.R. 
SP No. 140403 with the CA.
 A careful reading of the allegations of the instant Petition with the Court and the Petition for 
Certiorari
 filed with the CA indicate that the elements of 
litis pendencia 
are
 not present. At the outset, petitioner assailed different orders of the
 RTC â the first pertaining to interlocutory orders of the RTC in 
connection with the grant of the WPI and the other which decided the 
main action. Moreover, a comparison of the allegations and reliefs 
sought in the instant Petition and the Petition for 
Certiorari
 undoubtedly shows that petitioner prayed for different reliefs and ultimately, sought different objectives.

 Being interlocutory in nature, the RTC orders assailed in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 140403 dealt with the preliminary matter of whether the 
implementation of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC against respondent 
should be held in abeyance at a stage when the trial on the merits has 
yet to be held and the judgment rendered. Thus, petitioner, in assailing
 the RTC orders which granted and upheld the WPI in favor of respondent,
 merely sought the dissolution of the said writ which prevented 
petitioner from implementing Sections 108 and 184 against respondent 
until further orders and while the main case had yet to be decided on the merits
.

 On the other hand, the RTC Order and RTC Decision assailed in the 
instant Petition were in the nature of a final judgment or order which 
disposed of the main case on the merits. This is so since the Petition 
for Declaratory Relief was granted, thereby permanently enjoining 
petitioner from enforcing Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC against 
respondent until the Congress shall have enacted and passed into law HB 
3235 in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. Being in the
 nature of a final judgment, petitioner merely pursued his correct 
remedy, which was to file a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

 In any event, we note that the issue on forum shopping may be 
considered moot once the proliferation of contradictory decisions, which
 is precisely what the prohibition on forum shopping seeks to avoid, is 
no longer possible.
[34]
 In 
connection thereto, CA-G.R. SP No. 140403 has already been dismissed by 
the appellate court on technical grounds; hence, the danger which the 
rules on forum shopping seeks to prevent will no longer materialize in 
the instant case.
 Respondent's claim that petitioner failed to 
comply with the requirement for a certification against forum shopping 
must likewise fail. Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court provides 
that the sworn certification against forum shopping must be attached to 
the petition for review on 
certiorari
.
[35]

 In contrast, there is no requirement that motions for extension of time
 be accompanied by a certification against forum shopping.
[36]

 While the Court is not unaware that petitioner failed to disclose the 
proceedings in the CA in the certification against forum shopping 
attached to its motion for extension of time to file the Petition, we 
emphasize that petitioner nevertheless promptly disclosed the said 
proceedings when it timely filed the Petition with the required sworn 
certification against forum shopping. Thus, we consider the same to be 
sufficient compliance with the requirement.
  




Petition raises only questions of law that are cognizable through a Rule 45 petition.
 






It is settled that only questions of law should be raised in a petition for review on 
certiorari
 filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
[37]


 A question of law exists when the doubt or controversy 
concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain 
set of facts; or when the issue does not call for an examination of the 
probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of 
facts being admitted. A question of fact exists when the doubt or 
difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the 
query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the 
credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific 
surrounding circumstances, as well as their relation to each other and 
to the whole, and the probability of the situation.
[38]

 Respondent alleges that the Petition raises questions of fact that the 
Court cannot resolve without re-evaluating established or undisputed 
facts on which the trial court based its ruling. However, an examination
 of the present petition shows that petitioner is challenging the RTC's 
grant of the petition for declaratory relief on the premise that a 
petition for declaratory relief is inapplicable to contest tax 
assessments; that the petition for declaratory relief failed to comply 
with the basic requisites of Rule 63 of the Rules of Court; and the 
constitutionality of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC
 vis-Ã -vis
 the equal protection clause. Moreover, petitioner assailed the propriety of the RTC's grant of injunctive relief 
vis-a-vis

 Section 218 of the NIRC and the rule that a judicial decision must 
bring a final determination of rights, obligations, and responsibilities
 of parties. These are clearly questions of law which merely call for an
 examination and interpretation of the prevailing law and jurisprudence,
 and are cognizable by the Court in a petition for review on 
certiorari
.
  




The RTC acted without 
jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the Petition for Declaratory Relief
 and issuing an injunction against the collection of taxes.
 






To begin with, Commonwealth Act No. 55 (CA 55) provides that 
petitions for declaratory relief do not apply to cases where a taxpayer 
questions his liability for the payment of any tax under any law 
administered by the BIR. Section 1 of CA 55 provides:
  


 Section 1. Section one of Act Numbered Thirty-seven hundred and thirty-six is hereby amended so as to read as follows:


 SECTION 1. 
Construction
. â Any person interested under a 
deed, contract or other written instrument, or whose rights are affected
 by a statute, may bring an action in a Court of First Instance to 
determine any question of construction or validity arising under such 
deed, contract, instrument or statute and for a declaration of his 
rights or duties thereunder: Provided, however, 
That the provisions 
of this Act shall not apply to cases where a taxpayer questions his 
liability for the payment of any tax, duty, or charge collectible under 
any law administered by the Bureau of Customs or the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue.
 (Emphasis supplied)




 The Court has previously clarified that CA 55 has not been repealed by another statute and remains to be good law.
[39]

 Thus, the courts have no jurisdiction over petitions for declaratory 
relief against the imposition of tax liability or validity of tax 
assessments.
 More importantly, a principle deeply embedded in our
 jurisprudence is that taxes being the lifeblood of the government 
should be collected promptly, without unnecessary hindrance or delay. In
 line with this principle, Section 218 of the NIRC
[40]

 expressly provides that no court shall have the authority to grant an 
injunction to restrain the collection of any national internal revenue 
tax, fee or charge imposed by the code. An exception to this rule, 
provided under Section 11 of RA 1125
[41]
,
 obtains only when in the opinion of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) the 
collection thereof may jeopardize the interest of the government and/or 
the taxpayer.
[42]
 In 
the instant case, it is undisputed that respondent only proceeded with 
its petition after receiving tax assessments from the BIR and after 
various requests for reconsideration, where it notably already raised 
the alleged unconstitutionality of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC as a
 ground to contest the tax assessment against respondent. However, 
instead of appealing the assessments in the proper forum, respondent 
filed with the RTC the Petition for Declaratory Relief with a prayer for
 issuance of a TRO and WPI to enjoin the implementation of the 
aforementioned provisions while the said petition is pending. In 
reality, respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief is utilized as a 
vehicle to assail and prevent the enforcement of the tax assessments by 
alleging the supposed unconstitutionality of Sections 108 and 184 of the
 NIRC. On this basis, the RTC should have dismissed respondent's 
petition for lack of jurisdiction.
 Thus, we reiterate our 
statement in the assailed Decision that the RTC acted without 
jurisdiction in not only taking cognizance of respondent's petition, but
 in issuing an injunction enjoining the BIR from proceeding with the 
implementation or enforcement of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC 
against respondent.
  




Even assuming arguendo that the RTC had jurisdiction over the petition,
 
the
 RTC should have dismissed respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief 
for failure to comply with the requisites for the said action.
 






A petition for declaratory relief is an action instituted by a 
person interested in a deed, will, contract or other written instrument,
 executive order or resolution, to determine any question of 
construction or validity arising from the instrument, executive order or
 regulation, or statute and for a declaration of his rights and duties 
thereunder.
[43]
 The said 
action must comply with the following requisites: (1) the subject matter
 of the controversy must be a deed, will, contract or other written 
instrument, statute, executive order or regulation, or ordinance; (2) 
the terms of said documents and the validity thereof are doubtful and 
require judicial construction; (3) there must have been no breach of the
 documents in question; (4) there must be an actual justiciable 
controversy or the "ripening seeds" of one between persons whose 
interests are adverse; (5) the issue must be ripe for judicial 
determination; and (6) adequate relief is not available through other 
means or other forms of action or proceeding.
[44]


 After a review of the records of the instant case, We find no 
reason to disturb our finding that the RTC should have dismissed 
respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief for failure to comply with 
the abovementioned third, fourth, fifth and sixth requisites. 
 In connection with the third requisite, the Court in 
City of Lapu-Lapu v. Philippine Economic Zone Authority
[45]

 ruled that the trial court should have dismissed Philippine Economic 
Zone Authority's Petition for Declaratory Relief for lack of 
jurisdiction in view of the City of Lapu Lapu and Province of Bataan's 
demand for payment of real property taxes prior to the filing of the 
petition for declaratory relief. The Court explained: 
  


 We rule that the [Philippine Economic Zone Authority] erred in 
availing itself of a petition for declaratory relief against the City. 
The
 City had already issued demand letters and real property tax assessment
 against the [Philippine Economic Zone Authority], in violation of the 
[Philippine Economic Zone Authority's] alleged tax-exempt status under 
its charter. The Special Economic Zone Act of 1995, the subject matter 
of [Philippine Economic Zone Authority's] petition for declaratory 
relief, had already been breached. The trial court, therefore, had no 
jurisdiction over the petition for declaratory relief."
[46]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 It is undisputed that respondent had already received assessments 
from the BIR for deficiency documentary stamp taxes for the years 2011, 
2012, and 2013 and deficiency VAT for the year 2012, which were imposed 
pursuant to Sections 184 and 108 of the NIRC respectively, when it filed
 its Petition for Declaratory Relief assailing the constitutionality of 
the said provisions. In view thereof, the RTC should have already 
dismissed respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief for lack of 
jurisdiction. 
 Anent the fourth and fifth requisites, a 
justiciable controversy refers to an existing case or controversy that 
is appropriate or ripe for judicial determination, not one that is 
conjectural or merely anticipatory. A question is ripe for adjudication 
when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the 
individual challenging it.
[47]
 

 In the instant case, respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief does 
not present a justiciable controversy ripe for judicial determination. 
Respondent's petition failed to demonstrate that respondent's legal 
rights are subject of an imminent or threatened violation that should be
 prevented by the declaratory relief sought; the apprehension that its 
business may be rendered technically insolvent in view of the continued 
enforcement of the taxes under Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC appear 
to be merely conjectural and anticipatory. 
 Moreover, 
respondent's adequate remedy upon receipt of the FDDA for the DST 
deficiency for taxable year 2011 was to file an appeal in due course 
with the CTA instead of resorting to a petition for declaratory relief 
with the RTC.
[48]
 Similarly, 
the respondent's adequate remedy in the event of the issuance of a FAN 
in connection with its assessments for deficiency VAT for taxable year 
2012 was to protest the same with the BIR and if denied, appeal such 
denial to the CTA or request for reconsideration with the CIR.
[49]

 Thus, the sixth requisite is likewise absent. In view of the absence of
 the aforementioned requisites, the RTC should have dismissed 
respondent's Petition for Declaratory Relief. 
 All told, this 
Court finds no reason to overturn the assailed Decision. The assailed 
Decision is in accord with law and existing jurisprudence and with due 
regard to extant facts and evidence.
