LOPEZ, J., J.:


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
,
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated April 21, 2017 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated August 2, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
)
 in CA-G.R. CR No. 38706, affirming the conviction by the Regional Trial
 Court (RTC) of the petitioner of the crimes of child trafficking and 
child abuse. The challenged Decision denied the appeal filed by 
petitioner,
[4]
 while the assailed Resolution denied his Motion for Reconsideration.
[5]
 
The Antecedents


 Wilbert Brozoto 
y
 De Leon (
petitioner
) was 
indicted in two (2) separate Informations, both dated February 7, 2012, 
in Criminal Case Nos. 17296- 17297, for violation of Sections 3(a) and 
4(a), in relation to Sections 6(a) and 10(c) of Republic Act (
R.A
.) No. 9208
[6]
 and Sections 3 and 5 par. a(1) of R.A. 7610,
[7]
 respectively.
[8]
 The accusatory portion of the Information in Criminal Case No. 17296 states:
  


 That on or about November 28, 2011 at around 4:20 o'clock in the
 afternoon, at 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, Philippines, and within 
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, 
together with a certain "Roanne" whose identity had not yet been fully 
established, did then and there knowingly without authority of law, thru
 fraud, deception and taking advantage of the vulnerability of the 
person, did then and there[,] willfully[,] unlawfully and feloniously 
recruit AAA, a 14-year-old minor, for the purpose of prostitution/sexual
 exploitation.


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[9]
 




 Meanwhile, the accusatory portion of the Information in Criminal Case No. 17297 reads: 
  


 That on or about November 28, 2011 at around 4:20 o'clock in the
 afternoon, at 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, Philippines, and within 
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, 
together with a certain "Roanne" whose identity had not yet been fully 
established, did then and there knowingly, willfully and criminally 
engage in or promote, facilitate or induce child prostitution by acting 
as a procurer of one AAA, a 14-year-old minor for the purpose of 
prostitution, against the latter's will, thereby degrading or demeaning 
the intrinsic worth and dignity of said AAA, as a human being, in 
flagrant violation of the aforecited law. 


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[10]
 




 During the arraignment, petitioner pleaded 
not guilty
 to the charges.
[11]
 After the termination of the pre-trial, trial on the merits then ensued.
[12]
 
 
Version of the Prosecution


 The evidence for the prosecution consisted of the lone testimony of AAA,
[13]
 which, as culled from the Office of the Solicitor General's (
OSG
) Comment
[14]
 filed on behalf of the People, runs in this wise: 
  
 On November 23, 2011, AAA, who was then 14 years old, had a misunderstanding with her mother and ran away from home.
[15]
 With nowhere to go, she stayed with a friend named Marivic, who lived in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
[16]

 After four (4) to five (5) days, she transferred to 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, and lived with a childhood friend named Dianne.
[17]
 While staying with her, AAA helped out in the household chores in exchange for food.
[18]
 On November 27, 2011, AAA met petitioner through a common friend named Mary Joy.
[19]
 During that encounter, petitioner asked AAA if she would be willing to engage in sexual intercourse for money.
[20]
 With Mary Joy's persuasion, AAA agreed since she needed money and had no one else to depend on but herself.
[21]
 Petitioner then instructed AAA to tell her future clients that she is already 18 years old.
[22]

 The next day, or on November 28, 2011, Mary Joy approached AAA and told
 her that petitioner already found her a customer, whom she would meet 
at his house later that day.
[23]
 Late afternoon, AAA met a man and went with him on board a red car.
[24]
 The man asked AAA about her age, to which she replied, by saying that she was 18 years old, as per petitioner's instruction.
[25]
 At around 7 o'clock in the evening, the man and AAA arrived at a house where the former immediately led the latter to a room.
[26]
 Thereat, the man instructed AAA to remove her clothes while he was doing the same.
[27]
 Moments later, the man inserted his penis into AAA's vagina, fondled her breast, and inserted his finger into her vagina.
[28]
 After an hour, the man brought AAA back to petitioner's house.
[29]
 The man gave P2,000.00 to AAA, who in turn, gave petitioner his share of P600.00.
[30]
 AAA then bought food and went home.
[31]

 On November 30, 2011, AAA found out that her sister, together with some
 personnel from the Crime Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), was 
looking for her.
[32]
 She immediately gathered her things and moved to the house of another friend located in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
[33]
 She did not go home because she was too ashamed and embarrassed of what she had endured.
[34]
 On December 4, 2011, AAA's mother finally found her.
[35]
 In the evening of that same day, she told her mother everything she had gone through.
[36]

 Appalled, they immediately reported the incident to the 
xxxxxxxxxxx

Police Station, where AAA and her mother executed their sworn 
statements.
[37]
 On December 5, 2011, Dr. Anna Marie Cabral (
Dr. Cabral
) of the 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 Regional Hospital examined AAA and found finger-like lesions around her 
labia minora
 and healed lesions at 7 o'clock position of her hymen.
[38]
 
 
Version of the Defense


 The defense presented three (3) witnesses, namely: (a) petitioner himself, (b) Mary Joy Celo 
y 
Frias, and (c) Gemma Villarba Mendoza. Their combined testimonies, as lifted from petitioner's Petition for Review,
[39]
 tended to establish the following: 

 On the day of the incident, petitioner, together with his wife, was at 
the small town lottery, remitting the collection of bets.
[40]

 They were around 10 o'clock in the morning and returned at around 3:30 
o'clock until 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon for the second draw.
[41]
 The last draw was at around 9:30 o'clock in the evening.
[42]
 He only came to know AAA on November 29, 2011, when she and three (3) other companions whom he knew, passed by their house.
[43]
 
 
Ruling of the RTC


 In its Joint Decision
[44]

 dated February 19, 2016, the RTC convicted petitioner of the crimes 
charged based on the sole testimony of AAA, which the RTC found to be 
candid, straightforward, and unequivocal.
[45]

 It was established through AAA's testimony that petitioner procured a 
customer to have sex with her for P2,000.00, and that he received 
P600.00 as commission.
[46]
 
Moreover, AAA's claim that a sexual intercourse between her and a client
 transpired was corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Cabral, who 
found finger lesions around AAA's 
labia minora
 and healed lesions at 7 o'clock position of her hymen.
[47]

 Meanwhile, the RTC brushed aside petitioner's denial and alibi, which 
it found to be weak defenses that cannot prevail over the positive 
testimony of the victim.
[48]
 
For these reasons, the RTC convicted petitioner of child trafficking 
under Sections 3(a) and 4(a), in relation to Section 10(a), of RA. 9208 
and child abuse penalized under Sections 3 and 5 par. a(1), Article VI 
of R.A. 7610. The dispositive portion of its Decision states:
  


 WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing, finding the Accused 
William Brozoto y De Leon @ Bobby, guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as 
principal, of the crimes of Child Trafficking defined and penalized 
under the provisions of Sections 3(a) and 4(a), in relation to Section 
10(a), of Republic Act No. 9208, and for Child Abuse defined and 
penalized under Sections 3 and 5 par. a (1), Article VI of Republic Act 
7610, there being no mitigating nor aggravating circumstances attendant,
 he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of Twenty 
(20) years and a fine of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00), for Criminal
 Case No. 17296, and the indeterminate sentence of imprisonment ranging 
from Ten years, Two months and Twenty-One days (10 years, 2 months and 
21 days) of 
Prision Mayor
, as minimum, to Seventeen years, Four months and One day (17 years, 4 months and 1 day) of 
Reclusion Temporal
, as maximum, for Criminal Case No. 17297. 


 Further, the accused is ordered to indemnify AAA[,] the sum of 
Fifty Thousand (Php50,000.00) Pesos, as moral damages, and to pay the 
costs, in each case. 


 x x x x


 SO ORDERED.
[49]
 




 Unfazed, petitioner appealed to the CA.
[50]
 
 
Ruling of the CA


 As aforementioned, the CA affirmed the conviction of 
petitioner, ruling that the lone uncorroborated testimony of the 
offended victim, so long as it was clear, positive, and categorical, may
 prove the crimes as charged.
[51]

 Likewise, the CA affirmed the penalties meted out by the RTC, after 
finding the same to be within the range provided by R.A. 9208 and R.A. 
7610.
[52]
 Nonetheless, the CA 
imposed interest on the damages awarded to AAA. The dispositive portion 
of its assailed Decision is quoted hereunder: 
  


 
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DENIED.
 An interest at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum

 on all damages awarded to [AAA] in Criminal Case Nos. 17296 and 17297 
is imposed upon the total award to be computed from the date of the 
judgment until it be fully paid. 


 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
[53]




 Aggrieved, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was similarly denied by the CA in its assailed Resolution.
[54]
 Hence, petitioner brought the case on appeal before this Court and raised the following assignment of errors: 
  


 I. 


WHETHER [THE CA] GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE PETITIONER 
DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF SEXUAL 
ABUSE UNDER SECTION 5, ARTICLE III OF RA NO 7610. 


 II. 


WHETHER [THECA] GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY
 OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESS DESPITE ITS INCREDIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCY.
 


 III. 


WHETHER [THE CA] GRAVELY ERRED [IN] DISMISSING THE PETITIONER'S DEFENSE OF DENIAL.
[55]




 Petitioner asserts mainly that the uncorroborated testimony of AAA
 was not sufficient to establish that there was prostitution. Hence, it 
cannot be concluded that petitioner committed trafficking in persons and
 child abuse.
[56]
 On the contrary, the OSG refuted the argument proffered in this manner: 
first
, the testimony of a single witness may be sufficient to produce conviction, if the same appears to be trustworthy and reliable;
[57]
 second
, denial is a weak defense as against the positive identification by the victim;
[58]
 
third
, no improper motive could be imputed to AAA to show that she would falsely testify against petitioner;
[59]
  and 
finally
, time and again, this Court has accorded great weight to factual findings of the trial court.
[60]
 In sum, the issue is whether the prosecution has proven the guilt of the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt. 
 
Our Ruling


 The petition is 
bereft
 of merit. 
 In criminal 
cases, "[a]n appeal...throws the whole case open for review, and the 
appellate court has the duty to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in 
the appealed judgment, whether or not assigned or unassigned. The appeal
 confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders
 such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed 
from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal 
law."
[61]
 Guided by the
 foregoing consideration, and as will be explained hereunder, the Court 
deems it proper to: a) convict petitioner for qualified trafficking in 
persons under Section 6(a) of R.A. 9208 in Criminal Case No. 17296; b) 
increase the award of moral damages to P500,000.00; c) award exemplary 
damages in the amount of P100,000.00; and d) modify the indeterminate 
sentence in Criminal Case No. 17297 to fourteen (14) years and eight (8)
 months of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of
 reclusion temporal
, as maximum, in line with prevailing jurisprudence. 
  




I. 


All the elements of the crimes charged are present. 


















A.


Petitioner is guilty of qualified trafficking in persons. 






Petitioner was charged with and convicted of the following crimes: 
(1) trafficking in persons under Sections 3(a) and 4(a), in relation to 
Section 10(a), of R.A. 9208; and 2) child abuse under Sections 3 and 5, 
paragraph a(1) of R.A. 7610.   
  
 The term trafficking in persons is defined under Section 3(a) of R.A. 9208, which states: 
  


 SECTION 3. 
Definition of Terms
. â As used in this Act: 


 (a)
Trafficking in Persons
 â refers to the recruitment, 
transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or 
without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national 
borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion.,
 abduction., fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking 
advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or 
receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person 
having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which
 includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others 
or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, 
slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs. 


 The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt 
of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 
"trafficking in persons" even if it does not involve any of the means 
set forth in the preceding paragraph. 




 Meanwhile, Section 4(a) of the same law enumerates the acts that fall under the term "trafficking" in persons: 
  


 Section 4. 
Acts of Trafficking in Persons
. â It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts: 




 (a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or 
receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of
 domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the 
purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor,
 slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage; 






 In addition, Section 6 of R.A. 9208 provides that the crime is qualified when, 
inter alia
, the trafficked person is a 
child
.
[62]

 The law defines a child as "a person below eighteen (18) years of age 
or one who is over eighteen (18) but is unable to fully take care of or 
protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or 
discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition."
[63]
 On February 6, 2013, the law was amended by R.A. No. 10364,
[64]
 which expanded the elements of trafficking in persons to include the following acts: 
  






(1)


The 
act
 of "recruitment, o
btaining, hiring, providing, offering
, transportation, transfer, 
maintaining
, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders[";] 














(2)


The 
means
 used include "by means
 of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, 
fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the
 vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or
 benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another
 person"[;]














(3)


The 
purpose
 of trafficking 
includes "the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms 
of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or 
the removal or sale of organs[.]"
[65]
 








Here, the offense was committed on November 28, 2011, or prior to 
the amendment. Hence, the original provisions of R.A. 9208 apply. 


 In 
People v. Casio
,
[66]
 the Court defined the elements of trafficking in persons in this manner: 
  






(1)


The 
act
 of 
"recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of 
persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or 
across national borders."














(2)


The 
means
 used which include 
"threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, 
deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the 
vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or 
benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over 
another;" and














(3)


The 
purpose
 of trafficking is 
exploitation which includes "exploitation or the prostitution of others 
or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, 
slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs." 








"Trafficking in persons is a deplorable crime."
[67]
 "
The
 gravamen of the crime of trafficking is 'the act of recruiting or 
using, with or without consent, a fellow human being for [inter alia,] 
sexual exploitation.
"'
[68]
 As aptly held by the Court in 
Santiago, Jr. v. People
[69]
 :




 Human beings are not chattels whose sexual favors are bought or 
sold by greedy pimps. Those who profit in this way by recruiting minors 
are rightfully, by law, labeled as criminals. They should be the subject
 of aggressive law enforcement, prosecuted, tried, and when proof beyond
 reasonable doubt exists, punished. 




 The existence of the elements of qualified trafficking in persons 
was established by the prosecution witness, AAA, during trial. Her lone 
testimony proved that petitioner recruited her for the purpose of 
prostitution. The offense is qualified trafficking in persons because 
AAA, at that time was a minor. The criminal Information filed 
specifically alleged that AAA, was only 14 years old
[70]
 at the time of the commission of the offense, having been born on May 1, 1997,
[71]
 as evidenced by her birth certificate.
[72]
 
 The trafficked victim's testimony that she had been sexually exploited was "material to the cause of the prosecution."
[73]
 Relative to this principle, it is likewise settled that the testimonies of child-victims are given full weight and credit,
[74]
 since "[y]outh and immaturity are generally badges of truth."
[75]

 "When the offended part[ies are] of tender age and immature, courts are
 inclined 	to 	give 	credit 	to 	[their] 	account 	of 	what 	transpired,
 considering not only [their] relative vulnerability but also the shame 
to which [they] would be exposed if the matter to which [they] testified
 is not true."
[76]
 "Indeed, leeway should be given to witnesses who are minors, especially when they are relating past incidents of abuse."
[77]

 "The revelation of innocent child[ren] whose chastity has been abused 
deserves full credit as [they] could only have been impelled to tell the
 truth, especially in the absence of proof of ill motive."
[78]
 
 In
 XXX v. People
,
[79]
 the Court thus held: 
  


 It is settled that when it comes to the issue of credibility of 
the victim or the prosecution witnesses, the findings of the trial 
courts carry great weight and respect and, generally, the appellate 
courts will generally not overturn these findings. For the trial courts 
are in the best position to ascertain and measure the sincerity and 
spontaneity of witnesses through their actual observation of the 
witnesses' manner of testifying, their demeanor and behavior in court. 
Unless certain facts of substance and value were overlooked which, if 
considered, might affect the result of the case, the trial court's 
assessment must be respected, for it had the opportunity to observe the 
conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying and detect if 
they were lying. The rule finds an even more stringent application where
 the said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals, as in this 
case. (citation omitted) 




 "[W]hen the victim's testimony is straightforward, convincing, and
 consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, unflawed 
by any material or significant inconsistency, it passes the test of 
credibility, and the accused may be convicted solely on the basis 
thereof."
[80]
 Here, the RTC 
found AAA's testimony to be straightforward and consistent, which the CA
 even affirmed on appeal. While AAA admitted that she acceded with 
petitioner's offer to find means to provide for herself, her consent may
 not be used by petitioner as a valid defense.
[81]
 It is well to note that, "a child is presumed by law to be incapable of giving rational consent to any sexual intercourse."
[82]

 "The victim's consent is rendered meaningless due to the coercive, 
abusive, or deceptive means employed by perpetrators of human 
trafficking. Even without the use of coercive, abusive, or deceptive 
means, a minor's consent is not given out of his or her own free will."
[83]


 In 
Malto v. People
,
[84]

 the Court emphasized that children should not be deemed to have validly
 consented to adult sexual activity, because they are not capable of 
fully understanding or knowing the nature or import of their actions. 
For this reason, they are presumed by law to be incapable of giving 
consent to any sexual activity and must be protected from the harmful 
consequences of their attempts at adult sexual behavior. 	In 
Malto
, the Court explained the rationale in this wise: 
  


 [Children] cannot give consent to a contract under our civil 
laws. This is on the rationale that [they] can easily be the victim of 
fraud as [they are] not capable of fully understanding or knowing the 
nature or import of [their] actions. The State, as
 parens patriae
,
 is under the obligation to minimize the risk of harm to those who, 
because of their minority, are as yet unable to take care of themselves 
fully. Those of tender years deserve its protection. 


 The harm which results from [children's] bad decision in a 
sexual encounter may be infinitely more damaging to [them] than a bad 
business deal. Thus, 
the law should protect [them] from the harmful 
consequences of [their] attempts at adult sexual behavior. For this 
reason, [children] should not be deemed to have validly consented to 
adult sexual activity and to surrender [themselves] in the act of 
ultimate physical intimacy under a law which seeks to afford [them] 
special protection against abuse, exploitation and discrimination.
 
(Otherwise, sexual predators like petitioner will be justified, or even 
unwittingly tempted by the law, to view [them] as fair game and 
vulnerable prey.) In other words, a child is presumed by law to be 
incapable of giving rational consent to any lascivious act or sexual 
intercourse.
[85]
 




 Lamentably, the medical findings of the examining physician did 
corroborate AAA's claim that she engaged in sexual congress, as borne by
 the fact that there were lesions found in her hymen. Jurisprudence
[86]

 holds that when a victim's testimony is corroborated by the medical 
findings of the examining physician, the same is sufficient to sustain a
 verdict of conviction. All told, AAA's testimony, substantiated by 
medical findings, confirmed that petitioner persuaded AAA, who was only 
14 years old at that time, to have sexual intercourse with a man to earn
 a commission from such arrangement, which made him liable for qualified
 trafficking in persons. 
  




B. 


Petitioner is guilty under Section 5(a) of R.A. 7610 for acting as a procurer of a child prostitute.
 






Petitioner was, likewise, charged with and convicted of child prostitution under Section 5(a) of R.A. 7610, which states:   
  


 Section 5. 
Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse
. â 
Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other 
consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, 
syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct,
 are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual 
abuse. 


 The penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
 shall be imposed upon the following: 








(a)


Those who engage in or promote, facilitate or induce child prostitution which include, but are not limited to, the following: 


















(1)


Acting as a procurer of a child prostitute
 [.]










"Section 5(a) of R.A. 7610 punishes acts pertaining to or connected
 with child prostitution wherein the child is abused primarily for 
profit."
[87]
 In 
People v. Dulay
,
[88]
 the Court enumerated the elements of Section 5(a) of R.A. 7610 as follows: 




 1. the
 accused
 engages in, promotes, facilitates or induces child 
prostitution
; 


2. the act is done through, but not limited to, the following means:




 a. 
acting as a procurer of a child prostitute
; 


b. inducing a person to be a client of a child prostitute by means of written or oral advertisements or other similar means;


 c. taking advantage of influence or relationship to procure a child as a prostitute; 


d. threatening or using violence towards a child to engage him as a prostitute; or


 e. giving monetary consideration, goods or other pecuniary 
benefit to a child with intent to engage such child in prostitution; 




3. the 
child is exploited
 or intended to be exploited in prostitution and 


4. the child, whether male or female, is 
below 18 years of age
.
[89]
 




 In 
People v. Larin
,
[90]
 the Court defined when a child is deemed exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse: 
  


 
A child is deemed exploited in prostitution
 or subjected to other sexual abuse,
 when the child indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct
 (a) 
for money
, profit, or any other consideration; or (b) 
under the coercion
 or 
influence of any adult
, syndicate or group.
[91]




 A child exploited in prostitution may seem to consent to what is 
being done to her or him and may appear not to complain. However, we 
have held that "a child x x x is incapable of giving rational consent."
[92]

 "Initiation into the flesh trade with [a client] requires a level of 
familiarity with its ways and inner workings that an untrained minor, x x
 x would not have stumbled into on her own. To echo 
People v. Delantar
,
[93]
 
the forfeiture of the right to live free in society is the due requital for peddling a child to sexual servitude.
" 

 As earlier discussed, AAA's declarations established that petitioner 
exploited her in prostitution when he procured a customer to engage in 
sexual intercourse with her for a fee, from which pay he also benefited.
 Pitted against AAA's testimony, petitioner simply denied the charges 
against him. This notwithstanding, the positive testimony of AAA 
prevails over his negative and self-serving statements. No jurisprudence
 in criminal law is more settled than that denial is an intrinsically 
weak defense which must be supported by strong evidence of 
non-culpability to merit credibility and that alibi, on the other hand, 
is the "'weakest of all defenses, for it is easy to contrive and 
difficult to disprove and for which reason it is generally rejected.'"
[94]
 Hence, the Court has consistently ruled that denial cannot prevail against positive identification.
[95]
II. The penalty imposed should be modified.




 
A. Proper Penalty for Qualified Trafficking in Persons




 Anent the proper penalty to be imposed on petitioner, Section 
10(c) of R.A. 9208 provides that persons found guilty of qualified 
trafficking shall suffer the penalty of 
life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P2,000,000.00 
but not more than P5,000,000.00.
[96]


 As regards the award of damages, the Court, in 
People v. Lalli
,
[97]

 held that the awards of moral and exemplary damages were warranted in 
cases of trafficking in persons as the offense is analogous to the 
crimes of seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts, "which 
cause the victim physical and mental suffering, besmirched reputation, 
moral shock, and social humiliation."
[98]
 In 
Lalli
,
 the Court awarded moral damages of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages of
 P100,000.00 to each of the victims. Likewise, the imposition of six 
percent (6%) interest per annum on the award from the finality of 
judgment until full payment is proper in line with the Court's ruling in
 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
.
[99]




 
B. Penalty for violation of Section 5(a), Article III of R.A. 7610




 The penalty for the violation of the provisions of Section 5, Article III of R.A. 7610 is 
reclusion temporal 
in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[100]
 In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the proper imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal
 in its maximum period, the medium of the penalty prescribed by the law.
[101]
 
 Notwithstanding that R.A. 7610 is a special law, petitioner may enjoy the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law,
[102]
 since the penalty provided in R.A. 7610 adopts the nomenclature of the penalties provided under the Revised Penal Code.
[103]
 Consequently, he is entitled to a maximum term, which should be within the range of the proper imposable penalty of 
reclusion temporal

 in its maximum period (ranging from 17 years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 
years) and a minimum term to be taken within the range of the penalty 
next lower to that prescribed by the law, 
i.e., prision mayor
 in its medium period to 
reclusion temporal
 in its minimum period (ranging from 8 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months).
[104]
 In 
People v. Dulay
,
[105]

 the Court found the appellant therein guilty of violation of Section 
5(a), Article III of R.A. 7610, and sentenced her to fourteen (14) years
 and eight (8) months of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum. Meanwhile, as to the award of damages, the Court, in 
Dulay
,
 ordered the appellant to pay the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as 
civil indemnity, consistent with the objective of R.A. 7610 to afford 
children special protection against abuse, exploitation, and 
discrimination. 
 Indeed, while "the child is one of the most important assets of the nation,"
[106]
 he/she also remains as one of the most vulnerable.
[107]

 It is for this reason that "the child, by reason of his [or her] mental
 and physical immaturity, needs special safeguard and care," and "the 
law will rise in his [or her] defense with the single-minded purpose of 
upholding his [or her] best interest" in case of assault on his or her 
rights by those who take advantage of his [or her] innocence and 
vulnerability.
[108]
 R.A. 7610 
was precisely meant to advance the state's policy of affording 
protection to children from all forms of abuse, by providing sanctions 
for the most abhorrent crimes committed against their persons. The 
Court, as the adjudicative branch of the State, "has the 
incontrovertible mandate under the
 parens patriae
 doctrine to protect"
[109]
 them. In doing so, we "protect the future that rests in the lives of our children."
[110]
