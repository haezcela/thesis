THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 240507, April 28, 2021 ]


ASIAN TERMINALS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ETELIANO R. REYES, JR., RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




LOPEZ, J., J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated January 18, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated June 27, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
) in CA-G.R. SP No. 146498.
 
FACTS
:


 Eteliano Reyes, Jr. (
Reyes
) was employed by Asian Terminals Inc., (
ATI
)
 as Supervisor III/Foreman on Board who shall be responsible in ensuring
 that shift vessel operations are carried in accordance with ATI 
standards.
[4]
 
 On 
February 17, 2014, Reyes was supervising the loading and lashing 
operations at Q7 on board MV YH Ideals. He first went to Bay 30, but he 
had to leave the All Purpose Personnel (APP) tasked to finish the 
lashing operations as he needed to supervise the loading operations at 
Bay 38. With a twist of fate, an accident
[5]
 occurred at Bay 30 wherein a lashing bar fell on the pier apron hitting Manuel Quiban (
Quiban
) a vessel security guard.

 As expected, ATI directed Reyes to explain why he should not be 
penalized for negligence under Section 2.4 of the Company Table of 
Offenses and Penalties (
CTOP
).
[6]
 In his response,
[7]

 Reyes clarified that while completing the lashing operations at Bay 30,
 "EC Planner" directed him to transfer to Bay 38 to supervise the 
commencement of loading operations. Pursuant to said instruction, Reyes 
left the four (4) APPs to complete lashing operations at Bay 30 and 
proceeded to Bay 38 where a loading operation was about to start and the
 crane was already positioned.
 In a Notice to Explain with Preventive Suspension
[8]

 dated February 21, 2014, the ATI informed Reyes that his failure to 
ensure that the safeguards for works on board the vessel were faithfully
 observed constitutes probable violation under Section 2.2 of the CTOP 
(neglect of work, incompetence, inefficiency, negligence, failure to 
perform duties and/or responsibilities, or failure to observe standard 
operating procedures, in any case resulting in injury or death) and may 
merit the penalty of dismissal.
 Consequently, Reyes filed his supplemental response
[9]

 expounding on the necessity to transfer from Bay 30 to Bay 38. 
According to him, he needed to go to Bay 38 to ensure that the 
containers on deck are secured in accordance with the loading plan. 
Beseeching consideration, Reyes reminded ATI of his satisfactory 
performance for the past three (3) years and his consistent diligence in
 the discharge of his duties.
 Unmoved by Reyes' entreaty, ATI terminated his employment
[10]
 prompting Reyes to file a complaint
[11]
 for illegal dismissal. 
 
THE RULING OF THE LABOR ARBITER


 Finding that Reyes failed to prove the illegality of his dismissal, the Labor Arbiter (
LA
) dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, but awarded service incentive leave and 13
th
 month pay, thus: 
  


 WHEREFORE, a Decision is hereby rendered declaring that the 
dismissal of the Complainant was valid, However, Respondents are hereby 
ordered to pay Complainant service incentive leave pay and 13th month 
pay, 


 Computation is as follows: 






13
th
 MONTH PAY

P84,000.00






 


 








SERVICE INCENTIVE LEAVE PAY (3 yrs.)


 








P28,000.00/26 days= P1,076.92

  	    SO ORDERED.
[12]




 ATI and Reyes filed their respective appeals to the National Labor Relations Commission. 
THE NLRC RULING


 In a Decision
[13]
 
dated March 8, 2016, the NLRC reversed the findings of the LA as to the 
legality of Reyes' dismissal and modified the monetary award. The NLRC 
ratiocinated as follows: 
  


 The Labor Arbiter was simplistic in her approach in resolving the issue of negligence. 


 Her logic is that since complainant left Bay 30 before the 
lashing operation was completed; that he did not leave instructions to 
the All Purpose Personnel left behind; and there was no urgency in 
leaving Bay 30 for Bay 38, he was thus negligent.


 The Labor Arbiter should have taken into account the following circumstances before deciding that complainant was negligent,
 viz
:




 a. Complainant before the loading and lashing operations 
conducted the Tool Box among his subordinates, a safety requirement 
before starting the work. It means he conducted an orientation about the
 safety procedures 
vis-a-vis
 the loading and lashing operations;

        b. He personally supervised the lashing operations and observed 
if the APPs were doing it correctly. It was only when everything was 
correctly done that he left Bay 30 for Bay 38;
 
        c. Complainant's going to Bay 38 was in accordance with the 
schedule of the Quay Crane 7 which was now transferred to Bay 38 to 
commence loading. This action to transfer QC 7 to Bay 38 is normal as it
 is dictated by the work program of the crane. Complainant did not wait 
for the completion of the lashing at Bay 30 since he had to check Bay 38
 if the twist and shoe lock are properly placed before the loading 
starts. As QC 7 supervisor on board, he had to supervise and guide the 
QC Operator in loading operations. As a rule, all QC operators are not 
supposed to make any movement, 
i.e
., travelling, discharging and 
loading without the presence of a supervisor assigned for each QC. His 
presence in Bay 38 was thus necessary.




 When complainant transferred to Bay 38 from Bay 30, he was 
merely following the instructions of the EC Planner to transfer QC 7 to 
Bay 38 to commence loading. At the expense of being trite, the procedure
 for loading and lashing or fastening of cargoes is this: There is no 
need to wait for the lashing operations to be completed on Bay and to 
start loading the cross bay or another bay which sufficiently stands 
between the two bays. Waiting will only result in undue delays due to 
the fast pace of operations at the pier since vessels, local and 
international, have a schedule to follow.


 In the maritime business, time is gold and of the essence since 
undue delays disrupt the vessels scheduled (sic) and may result in the 
payment of demurrage fees.


 Finally, We also find that the injured security guard on board 
had no business walking at the apron of a NO WALK ZONE AREA without 
permission.


 Complainant was initially charged with negligence under the 
company's Revised Table of Offenses (TOP) 2.4 which provides a graduated
 penalty, thus: 1
st
 offense â 15 days suspension;  2
nd
 offense â 30 days suspension and 3rd offense â dismissal[,] through a Notice to Explain dated 18
th

 February 2014. Complainant submitted his well-written explanation the 
following day. Two days thereafter, he was charged with another offense.
 This time under TOP 2.2 which provides for a sanction of dismissal. 
Subsequently[,] or on 24
th
 March 2014, he was dismissed. 


 We believe that complainant's dismissal under the new charge is 
unwarranted. While it is respondent ATI['s] management prerogative to 
prescribe rules and regulations to discipline its employees and to 
impose sanctions on erring workers, the exercise of this prerogative is 
not unlimited, boundless[,] and absolute. x x x


 Given the fact that complainant followed the rules in the 
performance of his job and the furt.h.er fact that the incident 
resulting to injury to the guard would not have happened were it not for
 the latter's negligence in being in a place he was not authorized to, 
the imposition of the ultimate penalty of dismissal on complainant 
violates the rule of fair play and labor justice. 


 To recall, complainant was charged with negligence first under 
TOP 2.4 and later under TOP 2.2[.] Negligence to be a basis for 
termination of employment must be gross and habitual. "The concept of 
negligence as enunciated in Article 282 (b) [now renumbered as Article 
(b)], must not only be gross but habitual in character as well to 
justify depriving the employee of his means of livelihood" x x x. 


 x x x x


 Assuming complainant is guilty of negligence, let it be stressed
 that in his three years with respondent company, this is his first. 
Obviously[,] this is not a case of gross and habitual negligence that 
jurisprudence speaks about as ground for termination of employment. That
 said, this Commission finds his dismissal unjustified and illegal and 
as a consequence thereof, he should be reinstated without loss of 
seniority rights and with full back wages. 


 We agree, however, with respondent that the Labor Arbiter erred 
in the computation of benefits awarded the complainant. x x x. What 
appears complainant is entitled to, and the respondent completely is in 
agreement, is the former's proportionate 13
th
 month pay and 
SILP for the period January to March 2014 in the amounts of Php10,650.84
 and Php4,594.32 respectively or the total sum of Php15,245.16. 


 WHEREFORE, finding both Appeals to be impressed with merit, they
 are both granted. The Decision of the Labor Arbiter is REVERSED and SET
 ASIDE and a NEW ONE rendered as follows: 




 1. Complainant Eteliano R. Reyes, Jr. is declared illegally 
dismissed and ordered immediate[ly] reinstated, paid his back wages of 
P28,000.00 a month reckoned from March 24,2014 until finality of the 
judgment without loss of seniority rights and privileges; and


 2. Respondents Asian Terminal Inc. is ordered to pay his 
proportionate 13th month pay and SILP for 2014 in the sum of P15,245.16.
 




 All other claims are dismissed for lack of merit. 


SO ORDERED.
[14]




 ATI moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied m a Resolution
[15]
 dated April 27, 2016.
 Dismayed by the NLRC's disposition, ATI instituted a Petition for 
Certiorari 
before the CA. 
 
THE CA RULING


 On January 18, 2018, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which states: 
  


 WHEREFORE, the instant petition for 
certiorari
 is 
DISMISSED. Accordingly, the March 8, 2016 Decision and April 27, 2016 
Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission, Fourth Division 
in NLRC LAC No. 10-002783-15 are AFFIRMED.
[16]
 




 ATI's motion for reconsideration was also denied m the assailed Resolution
[17]
 dated June 27, 2018. 
 Hence, the present petition. 
 
ISSUE


 Whether or not the CA erred in ruling that no grave abuse of 
discretion was committed by the NLRC in denying petitioner's assertion 
of valid dismissal. 
 ATI maintains the validity of Reyes' 
termination from employment. ATI argues that as a company engaged in 
container yardwork, which involves the operation of huge industrial 
equipment to pick-up cargoes/containers at ports, it needs to ensure 
that industrial safety protocols are followed by all ATI personnel and 
third persons such that any deviation therefrom is not taken lightly. 
ATI adds that it puts high premium on the safety of its employees and 
workplace environment, that even a first offense caused by 
non-observance of safety standards where injury or death results, is 
meted the penalty of dismissal. According to ATI, since Reyes violated 
his duty in ensuring safety in shift vessel operations which caused 
injury to a third person, his dismissal is necessarily called for. For 
the first time, ATI advances that should this Court deem Reyes' 
dismissal as invalid, it shall be made liable to pay for his separation 
in lieu of reinstatement. 
 For Reyes, he asserts that he was 
illegally dismissed. He insists that the ATI failed to adduce clear, 
consistent, accurate, and convincing evidence to support the legality of
 his termination from employment. 
 
THIS COURT'S RULING


 ATI's arguments fail to convince. 
 
First
, ATI's 
arguments are mainly questions of fact and are generally not subject to 
review by the Court in a Rule 45 petition. Only questions of law may be 
raised in a petition filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as the 
Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.
[18]
 
 
Second
, in a petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the petitioner must establish that
 the respondent tribunal acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary, or
 despotic manner in the exercise of its jurisdiction as to be equivalent
 to lack of jurisdiction. As correctly observed by the CA, the petition 
before it failed to indicate with exactitude and substantiate that the 
NLRC acted in such a way that would amount to lack of jurisdiction. What
 the petitioner questioned was the NLRC's appreciation of the evidence 
before it which pertains to an error of judgment rather than an error of
 jurisdiction. 
 
Third
, the NLRC did not commit grave abuse
 of discretion. There is grave abuse of discretion when rendition of 
judgment was done in a capricious, whimsical, or arbitrary manner 
tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. Moreover, the concept of "grave" 
connotes that the abuse of discretion is so gross and patent that 
amounts to "an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to 
perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law."
[19]

 Here, the NLRC's decision, which upheld the illegality of Reyes' 
dismissal, has basis in evidence as well as in law and jurisprudence, 
hence, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed against it. 
 
Also, settled is the rule that in illegal dismissal cases, the employer 
bears the burden of proving that the termination of the employee was for
 a valid or authorized cause. This is consistent with the principle of 
security of tenure as guaranteed by the Constitution and reinforced by 
Article 292(b) of the Labor Code of the Philippines, which provides: 
  


 Art. 292. 
Miscellaneous Provisions 
- x x x


 (b) Subject to the constitutional right of workers to security 
of tenure and their right to be protected against dismissal except for a
 just and authorized cause and without prejudice to the requirement of 
notice under Article [298] of this Code, the employer shall furnish the 
worker whose employment is sought to be terminated a written notice 
containing a statement of the causes for termination and shall afford 
the latter ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the 
assistance of his representative if he so desires in accordance with 
company rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to guidelines set by 
the Department of Labor and Employment. Any decision taken by the 
employer shall be without prejudice to the right of the worker to 
contest the validity or legality of his dismissal by filing a complaint 
with the regional branch of the National Labor Relations Commission. The
 burden of proving that the termination was for a valid or authorized 
cause shall rest on the employer. x x x




 Indeed, as pointed out by the CA, ATI failed to present clear, 
accurate, positive, and convincing evidence that there is just cause to 
terminate Reyes' employment. For one, Reyes merely followed the rules in
 the performance of his job. In fact, his transfer to Bay 38 was by 
instructions of the EC Planner. Too, his transfer to Bay 38 was 
necessary because a quay crane has already been prepositioned and 
loading operation was about to commence.
 Withal, We find no 
reversible error committed by the CA in finding that no grave abuse of 
discretion is attributable to the NLRC.
 ATI advances, for the 
first time, that reinstatement is not the feasible alternative but the 
payment of separation pay in view of the strained relations of the 
parties.
 We do not agree.
 In 
Rodriguez vs. Sintron Systems, Inc.
,
[20]

 this Court elaborated that the doctrine of strained relations cannot be
 applied indiscriminately since every labor dispute almost invariably 
results in "strained relations"; otherwise, reinstatement can never be 
possible simply because some hostility is engendered between the parties
 as a result of their disagreement. That is human nature. Strained 
relations must be demonstrated as a fact. The doctrine should not be 
used recklessly or loosely applied, nor be based on impression alone. 

 Reinstatement cannot be barred especially when the employee has not 
indicated an aversion to returning to work, or does not occupy a 
position of trust and confidence, or has no say in the operation of the 
employer's business.
[21]

 Here, aside from the fact that this issue was only raised for the first
 time, there is also no compelling evidence presented to support the 
conclusion that the parties' relationship has gone so sour so as to 
render reinstatement impracticable. Also, Reyes has not demonstrated 
unwillingness to be reinstated and the existence of a confidential 
relationship between him, as a supervisory employee, and ATI, has not 
been established. For lack of evidence on record, it appears that his 
position was not a sensitive position as would require complete trust 
and confidence, and where personal ill will would foreclose his 
reinstatement.
[22]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is
 DENIED
. The Decision 
and the Resolution, dated January 18, 2018 and June 27, 2018, 
respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 146498 are 
AFFIRMED
.   
  
 Private respondent Eteliano R. Reyes, Jr., is declared 
illegally dismissed and ordered immediately reinstated, paid his back 
wages, from March 24, 2014 until finality of this decision without loss 
of seniority rights and privileges. 
 Petitioner Asian Terminals, Inc. is also ordered to pay private respondent his 13
th
 month pay and service incentive leave pay. 

 It is understood that the award shall exclude salary increase and other
 benefits which are contingent on variables such as employee's merit 
increase based on performance or longevity or company's financial 
standing. 
 Further, petitioner Asian Terminals, Inc. is ordered to pay private respondent legal interest of six percent (6%)
 per annum
 from the finality of this decision until full payment of the monetary award. 

 The labor arbiter is directed to issue and cause the implementation of 
the writ of execution in accordance with this decision, with utmost 
dispatch.
