FIRST DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 246088, April 28, 2021 ]


TITAN DRAGON PROPERTIES CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. MARLINA VELOSO-GALENZOGA, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




ZALAMEDA, J.:


A void judgment is in legal effect no judgment. By it no rights are 
divested. From it no rights can be obtained. Being worthless in itself, 
all proceedings founded upon it are equally worthless. It neither binds 
nor bars any one. All acts performed under it and claims flowing out of 
it are void. The parties attempting to enforce it may be responsible as 
trespassers.
[1]




This resolves the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[2]

 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Rules) filed by petitioner Titan 
Dragon Properties Corporation (petitioner corporation) assailing the 
Decision
[3]
 dated 01 June 2018 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA), Division of Five,
[4]
 and Resolution
[5]
 dated 26 February 2019 rendered by the CA, Special Division of Five, Special Former Third Division
[6]

 in CA-G.R. SP No. 150941 entitled, "Titan Dragon Properties Corporation
 v. Hon. Edgardo B. Bellosillo, in his official capacity as the 
Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 95, Quezon City, and 
Marlina Veloso-Galenzoga," which affirmed the Decision
[7]

 dated 21 October 2016 rendered by the Honorable Edgardo B. Bellosillo, 
Presiding Judge of Branch 95, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (Br. 
95-RTC), in Civil Case No. R-QZN-15-03231-CV for Specific Performance.




Antecedents



The very subject of litigation is a 70,364-square meter (sq.m.) parcel of land (subject property) situated in 
Barangay

 Damayan Lagi, New Manila, Quezon City and registered in the name of 
Titan Dragon Properties Corporation under Transfer Certificate (TCT) No.
 185260.
[8]
 However, 
petitioner corporation, through its then President Antonio L. Yao (Yao),
 allegedly sold the subject property in favor of respondent Marlina 
VelosoÂ­ Galenzoga (respondent). Purportedly, the transaction was 
evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale
[9]

 (Deed) executed between the parties on 08 December 1997 for a contract 
price of Sixty Million Pesos (Php60,000,000.00). The Deed also obligated
 petitioner corporation to shoulder the payment of capital gains tax 
(CGT) and documentary stamp tax (DST) while respondent agreed to pay the
 transfer tax and registration fee.
[10]





Respondent claimed that since 1997, she had been religiously paying real
 property taxes over the property. On the contrary, petitioner 
corporation failed to comply with its obligations to 1) deliver 
possession of the property and 2) pay the necessary CGT and DST.
[11]

 Respondent averred she made several verbal demands to his good friend 
Yao, but to no avail, until the latter's demise. Thus, respondent filed a
 
Complaint
[12]
 
for specific performance
 (specific performance case) dated 07 April 2015, to compel petitioner corporation to comply with its obligations.
[13]
 The case was raffled to Br. 95-RTC.




Respondent filed a 
Petition for 
Mandamus
[14]
 (
mandamus
 case) on 21 April 2015, docketed as 
Civil Case No. R-QZM-15-03669-CV
,
 just two (2) weeks apart from the filing of the specific performance 
case. The petition was raffled to Branch 76, Regional Trial Court of 
Quezon City (Br. 76-RTC). In her petition, respondent alleged facts 
similar to the specific performance case, except for the allegation that
 on 13 January 2015, TCT No. 185260 was cancelled, resulting to two (2) 
derivative titles in the name of petitioner corporation under TCT Nos. 
004-2015001698
[15]
 and 004-2015001699.
[16]

 Respondent claimed fraud as the owner's duplicate certificate of TCT 
No. 185260 was in her possession. She thus, sought to compel the 
Register of Deeds (RD) of Quezon City to 1) annul and cancel said 
derivative titles; and 2) reinstate TCT No. 185260.




Corresponding summonses were issued for both proceedings. However, the Sheriffs Return
[17]

 dated 27 April 2015 in the specific performance case showed that Br. 
95-RTC's deputy sheriff made attempts to serve the summons at the 6
th

 Floor, PBCom Building, Ayala Avenue, Makati. The first was on 16 April 
2015, when the deputy sheriff was informed by the administrative 
assistant of the building that petitioner company does not hold office 
at the 6
th
 Floor. He verified the same and found that the 
entire floor is being occupied by PBCom bank. The second time, the 
deputy sheriff went back to the same address but the building manager of
 PBCom informed him that petitioner corporation was not holding office 
at the 6
th
 Floor thereof. This prompted respondent to file a 
motion to serve summons to petitioner corporation by substituted service
 (publication),
[18]
 which Br. 95-RTC granted in an Order
[19]
 dated 09 June 2015.




Anent the 
mandamus
 case, the Sheriffs Return
[20]
 dated 11 May 2015, yielded service of summons to petitioner corporation at the 6
th

 Floor of PBCom Building, Ayala Avenue, through a certain Jona Agustin, 
front desk representative, who refused to sign the acknowledgment. 
Nonetheless, Br. 76-RTC declared that summons was properly served. The 
mandamus
 case was submitted for decision on 16 June 2015 upon failure of petitioner corporation to file its answer.
[21]




On the same day Br. 76-RTC also issued a Decision
[22]

 in favor of respondent. According to the trial court, respondent had 
been in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 185260. It 
assumed that the RD irregularly cancelled said title and issued two (2) 
new titles without requiring the presentation of TCT No. 185260. Thus, 
in its decision, Br. 76-RTC disposed:


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, judgment is rendered ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to:


1. Cancel Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 004-2015001698 and 
004-2015001699 in the name of Titan Dragon Properties Corporation;


2. Reinstate Transfer Certificate of Title No. 185260;


3. Annotate the Deed of Absolute Sale executed between Marlina 
Veloso-Galenzoga and Titan Dragon Properties Corporation, throught its 
president Antonio L. Yao, over the real property covered by Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 185260; and


4. Issue a new certificate of title over the subject property in favor 
of Marlina Veloso-Valenzoga, upon payment of the necessary fees and 
taxes.



SO ORDERED.
[23]

On 01 July 2015, petitioner corporation filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[24]
 in the 
mandamus

 case. Allegedly, petitioner corporation discovered that a decision was 
issued against it and was only able to secure copies of the same with 
the clerk of court of Br. 76-RTC.




In said motion, petitioner corporation maintained that the summons was 
improperly served to a receptionist, who is not an employee of 
petitioner corporation, nor among those who could be validly served with
 summons under Section 11, Rule 14
[25]
 of the Rules of Court.
[26]
 Hence, the service of summons was invalid, and the consequent decision rendered therein void.




Petitioner corporation also asserted that the decision in the 
mandamus

 case expanded the reliefs sought by respondent when it ordered the 
annotation of the Deed between respondent and Yao in TCT No. 185260 and 
the issuance of a new title in respondent's name. This, considering that
 respondent did not even pray for these reliefs.




Br. 76-RTC, now presided by a new judge,
[27]
 issued a Resolution
[28]

 on 21 April 2016 granting petitioner corporation's motion for 
reconsideration. It ruled that the court did not acquire jurisdiction as
 the summons was invalidly served. Moreover, the 
mandamus
 case 
was decided without respondent moving to declare petitioner corporation 
in default, and without the subsequent presentation of respondent's 
evidence 
ex parte
. The court also noted the precipitate haste in resolving the 
mandamus

 case having been decided the same day it was submitted for decision. 
Hence, the trial court set aside the Decision dated 16 June 2015 and 
ordered for summons to be issued to petitioner corporation.




Meanwhile, petitioner corporation was declared in default in the 
specific performance case upon motion by the respondent on 12 July 2016.
[29]
 Thus, Br. 95-RTC rendered a Decision
[30]
 dated 21 October 2016 granting respondent's complaint for specific performance, the dispositive portion of which states:




WHEREFORE, Judgment by deafult is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant.


Accordingly, the Court Orders as follows:



The defendant to pay the Capital Gains Tax and Documentary Stamp Tax
 to effect the transfer of title of the subject property; and




To deliver the possession of the subject real property to plaintiff Marlina Veloso-Galenzoga.




SO ORDERED.
[31]


On 27 October 2016, an Omnibus Motion
[32]

 was filed by respondent. She alleged that petitioner corporation caused
 the subdivision of the subject property fraudulently, resulting to the 
cancellation of TCT No. 185260 and the subsequent issuance of the 
derivative titles in its name. Respondent prayed for the trial court to 
cancel the said derivative titles for being void and to direct the RD of
 Quezon City to reinstate TCT No. 185260, annotate thereon the absolute 
deed of sale between respondent and Yao, and to issue a new title in her
 name.




In the interim, the said Decision dated 21 October 2016 in the specific 
performance case became final and executory on 12 December 2016 based on
 the Certificate of Finality
[33]

 issued by the trial court on 04 January 2017. A day after said decision
 became final, the omnibus motion earlier filed by respondent was partly
 granted in an Order
[34]
 dated 13 December 2016, the dispositive portion of which states:


Accordingly, the Register of Deeds of Quezon City is ordered
 to annotate on TCT No. 185260 the Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 
8, 1997 executed by and between Titan Dragon Properties Corporation and 
Marlina G. Veloso-Galenzoga; and to issue a new title in the name of 
plaintiff Marlina G. Veloso-Galenzoga upon payment of all taxes and fees
 due to the Government or upon the presentation of the pertinent 
Certificate Authorizing Registration from the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue, consistent with the Decision of the Honorable Court dated 
October 21[,] 2016.



SO ORDERED.


On 24 April 2017, a Writ of Execution
[35]

 was issued pursuant to an order of even date rendered by Br. 95-RTC 
granting the motion filed by respondent for the issuance of the said 
writ. However, the writ directed not only the execution of the Decision 
dated 21 October 2016, but likewise, the subsequent Order dated 13 
December 2016. A Notice to Comply
[36]
 was issued compelling both the petitioner corporation and the RD of Quezon City to comply with the writ of execution.




The Deputy RD of Quezon City
[37]
 was prompted to write a Letter
[38]

 to the Land Registration Authority (LRA) on 19 May 2017, seeking 
guidance on the implementation of the writ of execution in the specific 
performance case. According to the Deputy RD, TCT No. 185260, registered
 in the name of petitioner corporation, was already cancelled and two 
(2) derivative titles were issued, still under the name of petitioner 
corporation, due to the subdivision of the subject property. However, on
 16 April 2015, a certain Atty. Levito D. Baligod presented an alleged 
owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 185260 which the RD found dubious. 
Without confiscating the same, the then Acting RD requested for an 
investigation on the authenticity of said copy. Thus, the LRA, through 
its Task Force 
Titulong Malinis
 in TFTM No. 15-009, and supported
 by the findings of the Banknotes and Securities Printing Department of 
the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in its Report dated 17 March 2017, 
stated that 
the cancelled owner's duplicate and the original/registry
 copies of TCT No. 185260 of petitioner corporation were authentic and 
genuine
.
[39]




It was also relayed by the Deputy RD of Quezon City to the LRA, in her 
letter dated 19 May 2017, that respondent filed a speci fie performance 
case to compel petitioner corporation to pay the proper taxes with the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue and to deliver possession over the property, 
which case had already been decided in respondent's favor. Br. 95-RTC, 
however, issued an Order granting an omnibus order praying for the 
issuance of a new title in the name of respondent. The Deputy RD of 
Quezon City claimed that to comply with the trial court's directive 
would be tantamount to a collateral attack on TCT No. 185260 and its 
derivatives, in violation of the provisions of Section 48
[40]
 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1529.
[41]





Renato D. Bermejo (Bermejo), the LRA Administrator, issued an undated Legal Opinion
[42]

 pertaining to the query of the Deputy RD of Quezon City. According to 
Bermejo, the LRA is inclined on the execution and compliance of the RD 
of Quezon City considering that the questioned decision of the trial 
court is already final and executory.








The RD of Quezon City filed a Manifestation
[43]

 before Br. 95-RTC stating that the title sought to be cancelled, TCT 
No. 185260, had already been previously cancelled. Moreover, the RD is 
incapable of processing the issuance of a new title from a cancelled 
title considering its effect on the stability and indefeasibility of 
titles covered under the Torrens system.




Br. 95-RTC, however, was unimpressed and thus, commanded the RD to show 
cause why it should not be cited in contempt for failure to abide by the
 notice to comply in an Order
[44]
 dated 09 October 2017.




On the other hand, respondent filed in the 
mandamus
 case, a 
Motion to Withdraw Petition on 08 September 2017. Respondent alleged 
that the RD of Quezon City sought legal opinion concerning "issues that 
are closely intertwined with the case" and that the LRA issued a legal 
opinion directing said RD to perform certain acts which, if performed, 
would amount to the same reliefs sought by her.
[45]
 Respondent, however, failed to expound on the basis of her claim.




Petitioner corporation submitted a comment/opposition on the motion to 
withdraw, claiming that another case for specific performance had been 
filed by respondent in another branch. According to petitioner 
corporation, the 
mandamus
 and specific performance cases claim 
for reliefs which are not only related, but similar, hence, the motion 
to withdraw must be denied on the ground of forum shopping.
[46]



On 18 October 2017, Br. 76-RTC issued an Order
[47]
 dismissing the 
mandamus
 case with prejudice on the ground of forum shopping. The trial court found that respondent ultimately seeks, in both the 
mandamus

 and specific performance cases, for title to the subject property to be
 established in her favor. Further, respondent failed to state in her 
certification against forum shopping the existence and pendency of the 
specific performance case.




Respondent then filed a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of 
the Rules, docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. 156169 entitled, "Marlina 
Veloso-Galenzoga v. The Registry of Deeds of Quezon City, et al.," 
assailing the dismissal of the 
mandamus
 case with prejudice. This was later denied by the CA
[48]
 in its Decision
[49]

 dated 16 November 2018, affirming the finding of Br. 76-RTC that 
respondent committed forum shopping. The motion for reconsideration 
filed by respondent herein was likewise denied by the majority of the CA
 Division of Five of the Former Special Sixteenth Division by Resolution
[50]
 dated 30 July 2019, penned by Associate Justice Maria Filomena D. Singh, with the former 
ponente
 of the Decision dated 16 November 2018, Associate Justice Stephen C. Cruz, now dissenting.




Eventually, the 
mandamus
 case reached the Court, with respondent filing a petition for review on 
certiorari
 assailing the dismissal of her petition for 
certiorari

 before the CA, docketed as G.R. No. 248747. The Court takes judicial 
notice that on 15 June 2020, the Third Division of the Court, finding no
 reversible error on the part of the CA, denied the same.




Petition for 
Certiorari
 (Under Rule 65) filed before the CA assailing the Specific Performance case



During the pendency of C.A.-G.R. No. 156169, petitioner corporation filed its own petition for 
certiorari
 before the CA, docketed as 
C.A.-G.R. SP No. 150941
,
 seeking to annul and set aside in the specific performance case, the 
Decision dated 21 October 2016, and Writ of Execution dated 24 April 201
 7, as well as the proceedings held and conducted, and issuances 
rendered, by the Hon. Edgardo Bellosillo (Judge Bellosillo), Presiding 
Judge of Br. 95-RTC, pursuant to the same.



Petitioner corporation, through then counsel, Atty. Reynaldo P. 
Melendres, maintained that Judge Bellosillo committed grave abuse of 
discretion when he rendered the assailed decision despite improper 
service of summons in violation of petitioner corporation's right to due
 process and when he ordered the issuance of the writ of execution 
despite the Decision being void.




According to petitioner corporation, it only learned of the specific 
performance case against it on 12 May 2017. Allegedly, petitioner 
corporation was informed by its security guards stationed at the subject
 property that a broker went to said property wielding a copy of the 
decision and writ of execution. However, petitioner corporation never 
received any summons from Br. 95-RTC.




Petitioner corporation asserted that while summons by publication was 
effected, no diligent inquiry was made by the sheriff in serving the 
summons personally. Due to invalid service of summons, petitioner 
corporation was deprived of due process to present its meritorious 
defense.




In its Comment/Opposition,
[51]

 respondent insisted that the sheriff made diligent efforts in serving 
the summons. Furthermore, based on the Articles of Incorporation (AOI) 
and the General Information Sheets (GIS) filed by petitioner corporation
 for the years 2006 to 2015, it has consistently declared PBCom Bulding,
 Ayala Avenue, Makati City as its principal place of business.




Respondent likewise claimed that petitioner corporation availed of the 
wrong remedy, the proper one being a petition for annulment of judgment 
under Rule 47 of the Rules.




On 04 October 2017, petitioner corporation, now represented by new 
counsel, filed a Motion for Leave to File and Admit Attached 
Supplemental Reply (with Motion to Set Case for Oral Arguments).
[52]
 In its Supplemental Reply,
[53]
 petitioner raised the issue of forum shopping and alleged that the 
mandamus

 case and the specific performance case ultimately sought for the 
issuance of a new title in the name of respondent, with essentially the 
same facts and circumstances and the same parties with common interest.




Moreover, respondent's right of action in the specific performance case 
has already prescribed and is now barred by laches. It took seventeen 
(17) years from the execution of the deed of absolute sale before 
respondent filed a complaint for specific performance, beyond the 
10-year period provided under Article 1144 of the Civil Code.
[54]










Contrary to respondent's claim, petitioner corporation maintained the 
first page of its 2014 GIS clearly showed its complete and current 
address at "c/o Mindanao Textile Corp, -Km 16, ACSIE Compound, Severina 
Ind'l. Estate, Paranaque" (KM 16). However, respondent only attached, 
and the sheriff merely relied on, the cover page of petitioner 
corporation's GIS when in fact, the first page revealed its current 
address.




The sheriff was also required to make at least three (3) attempts on at 
least two (2) different dates to serve the summons pursuant to 
Manotoc v. Tinga
.
[55]
 However, he only made a second attempt to serve the summons at the same address as in his first attempt.




Petitioner corporation also claimed that it made the correct resort 
via

 a Rule 65 petition based on several decisions of the Court; a petition 
for annulment of judgment not being a plain, speedy and adequate remedy 
against judgments rendered or proceedings had without valid service of 
summons.




Finally, the authenticity of the Deed and the alleged duplicate copy of 
TCT No. 185260 in respondent's possession was put into question.




Ruling of the Court of Appeals



In its Decision
[56]
 dated 01 June 2018, the Court of Appeals (CA) Division of Five
[57]

 ruled to dismiss petitioner corporation's petition for being the wrong 
mode of appeal. The speedy and adequate remedy is a petition for 
annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules considering that the 
basis of the petition is the lack of jurisdiction over the person of 
petitioner corporation.




The CA Division of Five also ruled that service of summons by 
publication was properly done. The sheriff cannot be faulted for not 
attempting to serve summons at petitioner corporation's alleged business
 address at KM 16 considering it was not even stated in respondent's 
complaint for specific performance and pertained to the address of an 
unrelated company,
[58]
 
i.e.
, Mindanao Textile, Corp.




The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads:




FOR THESE REASONS
, the instant Petition for 
Certiorari
 is 
DISMISSED
.
 The assailed Decision dated dated (sic) 21 October 2016 and the 
subsequent Writ of Execution dated 24 April 2017, both issued by the 
public respondent Regional Trial Court, Branch 95, Quezon City in Civil 
Case No. R-QZN-15-03231-CV are 
AFFIRMED
.



SO ORDERED.
[59]


Associate Justice Pedro A. Corales (Justice Corales), a member of the CA
 Division of Five, however, registered his dissent with the majority.
[60]

 Justice Corales observed that there was a patent lack of valid service 
of summons. The sheriff did not even bother to serve the summons 
personally upon those authorized to receive the same, such as petitioner
 corporation's president, managing partner, general manager, corporate 
secretary, treasurer or in-house counsel. The lack of diligence to serve
 the summons personally rendered invalid the summons by publication. 
After all, it may only be resorted to after unsuccessful attempts to 
serve the summons personally and after diligent inquiry as to petitioner
 corporation's whereabouts.




Justice Corales also noted that the writ of execution issued in the 
specific performance case altered the terms of the judgment sought to be
 executed. The writ of execution, aside from ordering the payment of DST
 and CGT and the turn over of possession of the subject property, added a
 directive to the RD of Quezon City to annotate on TCT No. 185260 the 
absolute deed of sale and to issue a new title in the name of 
respondent.




In disregarding the rules on service of summons, and in altering the 
decision sought to be executed, Judge Bellosillo committed grave abuse 
of discretion. His manifest and obstinate disregard of the basic rules 
of procedure warrants the resort to Rule 65 of the Rules.













Petitioner corporation filed its Motion for Reconsideration
[61]
 which the majority of the CA Special Division of Five
[62]
 denied in its Resolution
[63]
 dated 26 February 2019, the dispositive portion of which states:



WHEREFORE
, WE stand by OUR Decision dated June 1, 2018. The Motion for Reconsideration is 
DENIED
.



SO ORDERED.


Feeling aggrieved, petitioner corporation filed the instant petition for review on 
certiorari
.



Issues



Both parties presented a slew of issues which may be condensed and 
simplified to the following: 1) propriety of resort to Rule 65 of the 
Rules; 2) the validity of the service of summons by publication; and 3) 
the propriety of the expansion of the writ of execution issued in the 
specific performance case.




Ruling of the Court




A judgment may be voided through either a collateral attack, or by 
direct attack via a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 or a petition 
for annulment of judgment under Rule 47







A void judgment is defined as one that, from its inception, is a 
complete nullity and without legal effect. A void judgment is not 
entitled to the respect accorded to, and is attended by none of the 
consequences of, a valid adjudication. Indeed, a void judgment need not 
be recognized by anyone, but may be entirely disregarded or declared 
inoperative by any tribunal in which effect is sought to be given to it.
 It has no legal or binding force or efficacy for any purpose or at any 
place. It cannot affect, impair, or create rights, nor can any rights be
 based on it. All proceedings founded on the void judgment are 
themselves regarded as invalid and ineffective for any purpose.
[64]




As void judgments produce no legal and binding effect, they are deemed 
inexistent. They may result from lack of jurisdiction over the subject 
matter or a lack of jurisdiction over the person of either of the 
parties. And they may also arise if they were rendered with grave abuse 
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Such void 
judgments may be attacked directly 
via
 a petition for annulment of judgment under Rule 47, and via a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules, respectively.
[65]





The majority of the CA Division of Five ruled that petitioner 
corporation should have availed of the remedy of annulment of judgment 
instead of petition for 
certiorari
 in attacking the decision of 
Br. 95-RTC in the specific performance case. This, considering that 
petition essentially assails the lack of jurisdiction over its person, 
not having been validly served with summons.




We do not agree.




While it is true that defective service of summons negates the Court's 
jurisdiction and is thus recognized as a ground for an action for 
annulment of judgment,
[66]
 this does not preclude the remedy of 
certiorari
.




In cases where a tribunal's action is tainted with grave abuse of 
discretion, Rule 65 of the Rules provides the remedy of a special civil 
action for 
certiorari
 to nullify the act.
[67]
 After all, the concept of lack of jurisdiction as a ground to annul a judgment does not embrace abuse of discretion.
[68]






Here, petitioner corporation does not only assail the lack of 
jurisdiction over its person on account of an invalid service of summons
 but likewise the grave abuse of discretion allegedly committed by Judge
 Bellosillo in patently disregarding the Rules of Court and applicable 
jurisprudence in issuing the decision and writ of execution in the 
specific performance case. To recall, petitioner corporation asserts 
that the expansion of the scope of the decision smacks of grave abuse of
 discretion considering that the writ of execution issued included 
reliefs not even prayed for in the complaint. After all, a petition for 
certiorari

 is a remedy directed not only to correct errors of jurisdiction, but 
also to set right, undo, and restrain any act of grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or 
instrumentality of the Government.
[69]




We are aware that while a void judgment is no judgment at all, any 
action to challenge it must be done through the correct remedy.
[70]
 However, to haphazardly conclude that the remedy of annulment is the only proper remedy and precludes resort to 
certiorari
,
 by singularly taking the allegation of lack of jurisdiction over the 
person of petitioner corporation as basis, is a myopic appreciation of 
the facts, issues and pieces of evidence, as well as interpretation of 
procedural rules and established jurisprudence. A holistic approach is 
favored to better serve the interest of justice.




Further, the lack of a valid service of summons may be properly assailed in a Rule 65 petition. Jurisprudence has allowed a 
certiorari
 petition to render judgments and writs of executions issued without valid service of summons as void. In 
Matanguihan v. Tengco
,
[71]
 the Court ruled 
certiorari

 is proper where the proceeding in the trial court has gone so far out 
of hand as to require prompt action. An action for an annulment of 
judgment is not a plain, speedy and adequate remedy. Similar resort to 
Rule 65 was allowed in 
Filmerco Commercial Co., Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court
,
[72]
 and in 
Santiago Syjuco, Inc. v. Castro
.
[73]

 More recently, the Court affirmed the findings of grave abuse of 
discretion by the appellate court committed by the trial courts in 
issuing decisions 
sans
 proper service of summons in 
Pascual v. Pascual
,
[74]
 
Express Padala (ltalia) v. Ocampo
,
[75]
 and 
Interlink Movie Houses, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
.
[76]



Even assuming, 
arguendo
, that a petition for annulment of 
judgment is the proper remedy, the CA is not barred from taking 
cognizance of the petition. In 
Heirs of So v. Obliosca
,
[77]
 where the inverse happened, 
i.e.
,
 annulment of judgment was deemed as improper remedy, the Court ruled 
that the higher interests of justice and equity demand that procedural 
norms be brushed aside:




After all, rules of procedure are intended to promote rather
 than defeat substantial justice, and should not be applied in a very 
rigid and technical sense. Rules of procedure are merely tools designed 
to facilitate the attainment of justice; they are promulgated to aid the
 court in the effective dispensation of justice. The Court has the 
inherent power and discretion to amend, modify or reconsider a final 
judgment when it is necessary to accomplish the ends of justice.


If the rigid application of the Rules would frustrate rather than 
promote justice, it is always within the Court's power to suspend the 
Rules or except a particular case from its operation. The power to 
suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as to
 alter even that which this Court itself has already declared to be 
final.
[78]


Given the realities obtaining in this case, the liberal construction of 
the Rules will promote and secure a just determination of the parties' 
causes of action against each other. As the court of the last resort, 
justice should be the paramount consideration when the Court is 
confronted with an issue on the interpretation of the Rules, subject to 
petitioner's burden to convince the Court that enough reasons obtain to 
warrant the suspension of a strict adherence to procedural rules.
[79]

 Petitioner corporation has shown more than enough valid and justifiable
 reasons why a relaxation of the Rules should be accounted in its favor.








The service of summons was invalid; Br. 95-RTC never acquired jurisdiction


 







Respondent moved for the service of summons by publication after the 
branch deputy sheriff failed to serve summons twice at the provided 
address, "6
th
 Floor of PBCom Building, Ayala Avenue, Makati 
City," which the trial court granted. Petitioner corporation, however, 
asserts that the requisites for service of summons for publication were 
not even met; thus, the service through such means is invalid.




Personal service of summons is the preferred mode of service of summons.
 Thus, as a rule, summons must be served personally upon the defendant 
or respondent wherever he or she may be found.
[80]

 The Rules, however, allow service of summons through other modes, such 
by by substituted service, and by publication. Under Section 14, Rule 14
 of the Rules
[81]
 then in 
force, summons by publication may be effected, by leave of court, when 
the whereabouts of the defendant is unknown and cannot be ascertained 
with diligent inquiry.




Thus, before summons by publication may be allowed, the following 
requirements must be satisfied: 1) there must be a written motion for 
leave of court to effect service of summons by publication, supported by
 affidavit of the plaintiff or some person on his behalf, setting forth 
the grounds for the application;
[82]
 and 2) there must be diligent efforts exerted by the sheriff in ascertaining the whereabouts of the defendant.
[83]




A perusal of the records reveals that the foregoing requirements were 
not met. While respondent filed, through counsel, a Motion to Serve 
Summons by Substituted Service,
[84]

 praying for summons by publication, it was not accompanied by the 
required affidavit executed either by respondent or by some other person
 on her behalf. Moreover, the Sheriffs Return
[85]

 does not show that diligent or earnest efforts were exerted by the 
sheriff in ascertaining the whereabouts of petitioner corporation.



The diligence requirement under Section 14, Rule 14 of the Rules means 
that there must be prior resort to personal service under Section 7 and 
substituted service under Section 8 of the same Rule, and proof that 
these modes were ineffective before summons by publication may be 
allowed.
[86]
 In 
Manotoc v. Court of Appeals
,
[87]

 the Court ruled that the sheriff must be resourceful, persevering, 
canny, and diligent in serving the process on the defendant. Moreover, 
there must be several attempts by the sheriff to personally serve the 
summons within a reasonable period, which means at least three (3) 
tries, preferably on at least two (2) different dates. There must 
likewise be reasons cited why such efforts were unsuccessful. It is only
 then that impossibility of service can be confirmed or accepted.
[88]




The Sheriff's Return in this case states:




THIS IS TO CERTIFY that on April 16, 2015, 
the 
undersigned tried to Serve a copy of the Summons together with the 
Complaint and Annexes to the defendant Titan Dragon Properties 
Corporation located at 6
th
 Floor, PBCom Buidling, Ayala Avenue, Makati City
.
 On same date, the undersigned was informed by a certain Administrative 
Assistant, Ms. Gina Busque[,] that no such company exist[s] at the given
 address. The Undersigned went up to the 6
th
 Floor of the PBCom Building to verify the said address and I found out that the Entire 6
th
 Floor is occupied by PBCom Bank.


Dissatisfied, the undersigned went again on April 23, 2015, 
the undersigned again tried to Serve a copy of the Summons together with the Complaint and Annexes to the defendant
.
 On the same date, the undersigned was informed by the Building Manager 
of PBCom, a certain Mr. Jonathan P. Roda that the defendant Titan Dragon
 Properties Corporation was not holding office at the above described 
address.


Respectfully returned for your information and guidance.
[89]
 [Emphasis supplied.]


It is apparent from the said return that the sheriff only tried to serve
 the summons personally twice on two (2) separate dates, contrary to 
respondent's allegation that the sheriff made three (3) of the mandated 
attempts. The sheriff's act of going up to the 6
th
 Floor to check whether or not petitioner corporation was holding office thereat
[90]

 cannot, by any stretch of imagination be considered as a separate 
attempt to serve summons. For one, the sheriff did not even state that 
he made an attempt to serve the summons anew to petitioner corporation 
when he went to the 6
th
 Floor of PBCom. For another, the 
sheriff himself categorically alleged in his return that he "tried to 
Serve a copy of the Summons together with the Complaint and Annexes to 
the defendant Titan Dragon Properties Corporation located at 6
th
 Floor, PBCom Buidling, Ayala Avenue, Makati City" only on 16 April 2015 and again on 23 April 2015.




Further, the sheriff did not even bother to state if he made inquiries 
with Administrative Assistant Ms. Gina Busque and Building Manager Mr. 
Jonathan P. Roda, both of PBCom Tower, if petitioner corporation 
previously held office in the said building and whether they have 
information where it may now be found. Also, nothing in the said return 
shows that the sheriff tried to effect a substituted service of summons.
 Neither did the sheriff bother to explain, at the very least, that 
substituted service of summons was not feasible.




Both parties in this case belabored the issue of whether or not the 
sheriff exerted efforts to locate the whereabouts of petitioner 
corporation. Respondent insists that the cover pages of the GIS and AOI 
of petitioner corporation for several years show its address as 6
th

 Floor, PBCom Building, Ayala Avenue, Makati City. Petitioner 
corporation, on the other hand, maintains that it provided, in the same 
GIS alluded to by respondent, its current address at Km 16, ACSIE 
Compound, Severina Ind'l. Estate, ParaÃ±aque. However, respondent merely 
attached its cover page, without including the rest of the GIS, or at 
least, the first page thereof where its current address is stated.




Indeed, the cover page of petitioner corporation's GIS shows its address at the 6
th

 Floor of PBCom Building. It is equally true, however, that on the very 
next page of the GIS, its current address at KM 16 is likewise provided.
 Thus, the sheriff, upon failure to serve the summons at the address 
provided by respondent, should have endeavored to ask the latter for an 
alternative address; or, at the very least, asked for the complete pages
 of petitioner corporation's GIS.




The sheriff could have also visited the subject property and attempted 
to serve the summons at said place. This, considering respondent's 
prayer in her complaint in the specific performance case that petitioner
 corporation remains in possession thereof. Moreover, the sheriff could 
have tried searching for petitioner corporation's address using the 
internet. However, the sheriff did the bare minimum by limiting service 
at the 6
th
 Floor of PBCom Building. To Our mind, the sheriff 
fell short of his duty to be resourceful, persevering, canny, and 
diligent in serving the summons on petitioner corporation.




Contrary to the findings of the majority of the CA Division of Five,
[91]
 the presumption of regularity in the performance of the sheriffs duty cannot justify the glaring disregard of procedural rules.
[92]
 After all, the presumption of regularity in the issuance of the sheriffs return does not apply to patently defective returns,
[93]
 as in this case.




Likewise, We stress that respondent had the responsibility to provide 
alternative addresses after the service of summons at the original given
 address turned futile. After all, respondent claimed herself in her 
complaint for 
mandamus
, which she filed two (2) weeks after the 
specific performance case, that she demanded from Yao, while still 
alive, and after the latter's death, from the representatives/owners of 
petitioner corporation, to abide by the terms of the Deed.
[94]
 This only shows that respondent was aware all along of the whereabouts of petitioner corporation and/or its representatives.




In 
Yu v. Yu
,
[95]
 citing 
Dulap v. Court of Appeals
,
[96]

 the Court explained the importance of requiring the fullest compliance 
with all the requirements of the statute permitting service by 
publication in this wise:




x x x Where service is obtained by publication, the entire 
proceeding should be closely scrutinized by the courts and a strict 
compliance with every condition of law should be exacted. Otherwise 
great abuses may occur, and the rights of persons and property may be 
made to depend upon the elastic conscience of interested parties rather 
than the enlightened judgment of the court or judge.

In court proceedings, there is no right more cherished than the right of
 every litigant to be given an opportunity to be heard. This right 
begins at the very moment that summons is served on the defendant. The 
Rules place utmost importance in ensuring that the defendant personally 
grasp the weight of responsibility that will befall him.
[97]

 Statutes prescribing modes other than personal service of summons must 
be strictly complied with to give the court jurisdiction, and such 
compliance must appear affirmatively on the return.
[98]

 As such, the rules must be followed strictly, faithfully and fully as 
they are extraordinary in character and considered in derogation of the 
usual method of service.
[99]





Absent compliance with the rigid requirements on the service of summons,
 service by publication is invalid. Hence, Br. 95-RTC never acquired 
jurisdiction over the person of petitioner corporation. Necessarily, the
 proceedings and any judgment, including all issuances rendered in the 
specific performance case are null and void.
[100]








The Writ of Execution issued 
in the specific performance case expanded the scope of the Decision 
dated 16 October 2016 of Br. 95-RTC it sought to execute


 







A void judgment creates no rights and produces no effect, thus all acts 
performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal 
effect,
[101]
 including writs 
of execution issued pursuant thereto. Considering that the proceedings 
and the decision in the specific performance case are void, necessarily,
 the writ of execution ordered by Br. 95-RTC to be issued is likewise 
void.




The Court notes, however, that the patent nullity of the proceedings in 
the specific performance case is further exacerbated by the issuance of a
 writ of execution which included matters not even prayed for by 
respondent in her complaint. As earlier stated, respondent merely prayed
 for two (2) things: first, that petitioner corporation be made to pay 
the CGT and DST pursuant to the absolute deed of sale; and second, for 
petitioner corporation to turn over possession of the subject property.




Notwithstanding, the writ directed not only the execution of the 
Decision dated 21 October 2016, which already became final on 12 
December 2016, but likewise, the subsequent Order dated 13 December 
2016. The latter order mandated the RD of Quezon City to reinstate TCT 
No. 185260, which had been earlier cancelled and subdivided by 
petitioner corporation, to annotate thereon the absolute deed of sale 
between respondent and Yao, and to issue a new title in the name of 
respondent. Thus, Judge Bellosillo whimsically expanded the scope of an 
already final and executory decision at the time by including reliefs 
not even stated in the said decision or prayed for by respondent in her 
complaint for specific performance. Such act is a blatant disregard of 
the most basic rules of procedure. It is so contumacious and scandalous 
that it behooves the Court why the appellate court turned a blind eye on
 this issue.




Elementary is the rule that a writ of execution must substantially 
conform to the judgment sought to be enforced, more particularly, to 
that ordained or decreed in the dispositive portion of the decision.
[102]

 The courts may not go beyond the terms of the judgment sought to be 
executed. Where the executions is not in harmony with the judgment which
 gives it life and exceeds it, it has 
pro tanto
 no validity. To 
maintain otherwise would be to ignore the constitutional provision 
against depriving a person of his property without due process of law.
[103]








Judge Bellosillo, as Presiding
 Judge of Br. 95-RTC, committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing 
summons by publication which eventually led to the declaration of 
default on the part of petitioner corporation and the issuance of the 
assailed judgment by default and the writ of execution


 







In petitions for review on 
certiorari
 emanating from Rule 65 
petitions, the question of law presented before the Court is whether or 
not the CA was correct in its finding of the presence or absence of 
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
[104]

 And in this, We find that contrary to the ruling of the majority of the
 CA Division of Five, Judge Bellosillo committed grave abuse of 
discretion.




Grave abuse of discretion means such capricious or whimsical exercise of
 judgment which is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of 
discretion must be grave, as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary
 or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and the 
abuse must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a 
positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined, or 
to act at all, in contemplation of law, as to be equivalent to having 
acted without jurisdiction.
[105]




The manifest abuse of discretion exhibited by Judge Bellosillo in 
allowing the service of summons through publication, which led to the 
issuance of judgment of default against petitioner corporation and in 
expanding the dispositive portion of the Decision dated 16 October 2016 
by issuing a writ of execution containing terms neither appearing in 
said decision nor in the complaint for specific performance, must not be
 countenanced. Moreso, the wanton disregard of basic procedural 
requirements led to the deprivation of due process of law on the part of
 petitioner corporation.




If only to emphasize the gravity of the abuse of discretion committed, 
petitioner corporation was stripped of, not only the possession of the 
subject property, but likewise, title thereto. To reiterate, the writ of
 execution included the cancellation of its derivative titles emanating 
from TCT No. 185260 and the issuance of a new title in the name of 
respondent. This, despite the fact that the case is simply one for 
specific performance for the payment of CGT and DST and the turn over of
 possession of the subject property.





Based on the records, petitioner corporation, in fact, was ousted of possession over the subject property on 03 February 2020.
[106]
 Worse, its derivative titles were cancelled
[107]
 and new ones
[108]
 were issued in the name of respondent.
[109]

 Thus, the trial court judge should have exercised prudence and caution 
considering especially that the property involved in this case is a 
7-hectare plot of land in the prime location of New Manila, Quezon City.








An order of default is frowned upon and not looked upon with favor


 







The Court takes notice that as a result of the allowance of service of 
summons by publication, petitioner corporation was declared in default 
and a judgment by default was entered against it. This deprived 
petitioner corporation of its day in court to present its meritorious 
defense which eventually led to the deprivation of its title to and 
possession over the subject 70,364 sq.m property in New Manila, Quezon 
City without due process of law.




The policy of the law is to have every litigant's case tried on the 
merits as much as possible. Hence, judgments by default are frowned 
upon. 
A case is best decided when all contending parties are able to 
ventilate their respective claims, present their arguments and adduce 
evidence in support thereof.
 The parties are thus given the chance 
to be heard fully and the demands of due process are subserved. 
Moreover, it is only amidst such an atmosphere that accurate factual 
findings and correct legal conclusions can be reached by the courts.
[110]








A void decision is a nullity, thus, it never acquires finality


 







The Decision dated 21 October 2016 in the specific performance case, 
including all orders, resolutions and the writ of execution issued 
pursuant thereto, are void. When a judgment is void for lack of 
jurisdiction and its nullity is shown by virtue of its own recitals, it 
may be said to be a lawless thing, which can be treated as an outlaw and
 slain at sight, or ignored wherever and whenever it exhibits its head.
[111]
 A void judgment is no judgment at all, hence, it can never attain finality.
[112]




Finally, considering the nullity of the issuance of the summons by 
publication, all proceedings emanating therefrom are likewise void. 
Thus, in order to afford petitioner corporation of its day in court, as 
originally prayed for by petitioner corporation in its pleadings
[113]

 before the CA, and to afford the parties ample opportunity to thresh 
out their respective claims and defenses, the remand of the case to the 
trial court is proper. Forthwith, Br. 95-RTC is mandated to issue 
summons anew to petitioner corporation at its current address.
