The Cases



In 
G.R. No. 230476
, Spouse Harlin Cast Abayon and Daryl Grace 
Abayon (Spouses Abayon) assail the following disquisitions of the Court 
of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 137780, entitled 
Ferndale Homes Homeowners Association Inc. v. Spouses Harlin C. Abayon and Daryl Grace Abayon
:

Decision
[1]

 dated August 9, 2016 dismissing their claim against Ferndale Homes 
Homeowners Association Inc. (FHHAI) for reimbursement of association 
dues, damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses, and directing 
them to pay twelve percent (12%) interest 
per annum
 and six percent (6%) penalty per annum for late payment of association dues; and

Resolution
[2]
 dated March 8, 2017 denying reconsideration.







In 
G.R. No. 230426
, FHHAI assails the same dispositions insofar 
as the Court of Appeals reduced the award of interest and penalty for 
late payment from 24% to 12% and 8% to 6% 
per annum
, respectively.

The facts are undisputed.



Ferndale Homes is a residential subdivision project located in Barangay Pasong Tamo, Quezon City.

By Deed of Exchange of Real Property

 dated March 18, 2005, Salud and Castro bartered Lots 1, 3, 5, and 7, 
Ferndale Homes with the properties of Spouses Abayon in Cebu City.
[6]



As lot owners at Ferndale Homes, Spouses Abayon became members of FHHAI.
 Consequently, they were required to pay association dues, including 
those that had accrued prior to their acquisition of Lots 1, 3, 4, and 
5. FHHAI also charged them 24% interest and 8% penalty 
per annum
 for late payment.

In December 2013, Spouses Abayon
[9]

 filed with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) a 
complaint against FHHAI for sum of money and damages. They essentially 
argued that they acquired Lots 1, 3 and 5 only on March 18, 2005, and 
Lot 4, only on October 15, 2004. Consequently, they should be reimbursed
 for the association dues they paid which accrued prior to acquisition,

More, FHHAI purportedly had no basis for imposing 24% interest and 8% 
penalty on late payments. In any case, these rates were excessive, 
unconscionable and unjust, hence, they should get a refund of the 
amounts they were made to pay.
[12]



On the other hand, FHHAI riposted that by accepting the lots, Spouses 
Abayon also accepted the terms of the Deed of Restrictions, as well as 
the FHHAI House Rules and By Laws. Corollarily, it had the right to 
enforce all restrictions, covenants, liens and charges embodied therein,
 including the assessment and collection of dues, including the 
imposition of 24% interest and 8% penalty for late payments.
[13]


HLURB Ruling



By Decision
[14]
 dated June 27,
 2014, HLURB Regional Office Arbiter Ma. Larina J. Rigor (HLURB Arbiter 
Rigor) granted the complaint. She found that though the FHHAI By Laws 
requires the members to pay membership dues, nowhere does it obligate 
their successors-in-interest to pay the unpaid dues of these previous 
members or lot owners. Thus, Spouses Abayon should not be held liable to
 pay membership dues which accrued prior to their acquisition of the 
subject lots.
[15]



Too, the 24% interest on late payments was highly excessive. Hence, it 
was reduced to 6%. As for the 8% penalty, the same was deleted since it 
served the same purpose as the interest on delayed payments. At any 
rate, although the 2006 FHHAI House Rules bears the imposition of 
24interest and 8% penalty, they could have been validly imposed 
beginning only in 2007.
[16]



The aforesaid decision disposed of the complaint, in this wise:


WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:


1. Reducing the interest rate of 24% per annum for late payments to 6% per annum reckoned from January 2007;


2. Deleting the additional 8% per annum penalty on delinquent accounts 
stipulated in respondent Association's House Rules and Regulations;




3. Ordering respondent Association to refund to complainants [Spouses] 
Abayon the payments made representing the interests and penalties paid 
prior to January 2007;


4. Ordering respondent Association to refund to complainants the 
payments made before 18 March 2005 representing the association dues, 
interests and penalties for Lots 1, 3, 5 and 7 with legal interest at 
the rate of 6% per annum reckoned [from] the date of the filing of the 
instant action until fully paid;








5. Ordering respondent to refund the complainants the payments made 
reckoned from January 2007 representing the interests in excess of 6% 
per annum and penalty of 8% per annum with legal interest at the rate of
 6% per annum reckoned from the date of the filing of the instant action
 until fully paid; and





6. Ordering respondent Association to pay to complainants the amount of 
P50,000.00 as and by way of exemplary damages; the amount of P25,000.00 
as and by way of attorney's fees; and the cost of suit in the amount of 
filing fees.


All other claims and counterclaims are hereby dismissed.


SO ORDERED.
[17]



On September 22, 2014, the HLURB Board of Commissioners denied the 
subsequent appeal of FHHAI due to procedural lapses pertaining to its 
surety bond - FHHAI did not sign copies of the Indemnity Agreement and 
Assignment of Cash deposit, and Spouses Abayon were not furnished a 
certified true copy of the surety bond.
[18]
 Thus, FHHAI elevated the case before the Court of Appeals.


Ruling of the Court of Appeals



In its assailed Decision
[19]
 dated August 9, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the HLURB ruling, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 
27, 2014 of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board-Expanded National 
Capital Region Field Office and Resolution dated September 22, 2014 of 
the HLURB Board of Commissioners are REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new 
one is entered:


1. REDUCING the interest rate of24% per annum for late payments to 12% per annum;


2. REDUCING the penalty charge of8% per annum on delinquent accounts to 6% per annum; and


3. ORDERING the Ferndale Homes Homeowners Association to REIMBURSE the 
Spouses Harlin Cast and Daryl Grace J. Abayon of the interest and 
penalty paid in excess of the 12% interest per annum and 6% penalty 
charge per annum, as herein reduced; and




4. DISMISSING the claims for reimbursement of paid association dues and 
the claims for damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses.


The instant case is REMANDED to the HLURB National Capital Region Field 
Office for appropriate computation of the reimbursable amounts, taking 
into consideration the foregoing dispositions.







 
 


SO ORDERED.
[20]



The Court of Appeals noted that the FHHAI in fact complied with the 
surety bond requirement under the 2011 Revised Rules of Procedure. FHHAI
 did so by immediately rectifying the supposed defects in the surety 
bond, as manifested in their Supplemental Memorandum before the HLURB 
Commissioners.
[21]



It also found Spouses Abayon liable for the assessed dues, including 
those which accrued even before they acquired the lots in question. For 
under Ferndale Homes' Deed of Restrictions, unpaid assessments 
constitute liens on the property - liens which Spouses Abayon were 
deemed to have assumed when they acquired the subject lots.
[22]





Spouses Abayon further became liable for interest and penalties on late 
payments. These were already imposed under the 2002 House Rules of 
FHHAI. The astronomical rates, however, had to be reduced from 24% to 
12% interest 
per annum
, and from 8% to 6% for the penalty, 
per annum
.
[23]



The Court of Appeals likewise deleted the award of damages and attorney's fees for lack of basis.
[24]



Both parties moved for reconsideration which the Court of Appeals denied by Resolution
[25]
 dated March 8, 2017.


Present Petitions


G.R. No. 230476



Spouses Abayon seek the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction and
 pray for the reinstatement of the HLURB rulings. We synthesize their 
arguments.


First.
 Contrary to the findings of the Court of Appeals, the 
attachments to FHHAI's Supplemental Memorandum did not cure its 
defective appeal before the HLURB Board of Commissioners. Specifically, 
Section 52, Rule 14
[26]
 of the
 2011 Revised Rules of Procedure of the HLURB requires an appellant to 
post a surety bond accompanied by a joint declaration under oath by the 
appellant and the bonding company that the bond posted is genuine, among
 others. As it was, the joint declaration attached to FHHAI's 
Supplemental Memorandum was only signed by the surety company only, sans
 the signature of appellant FHHAI itself.
[27]


Second.
 They should not be held liable for association dues on 
Lots 1, 3, 4, and 5 which had accrued prior to their acquisition of the 
lots. As HLURB Arbiter Rigor found, nowhere in the by-laws does it 
impose upon successorsÂ­in-interest the duty and burden to pay the unpaid
 dues of their predecessors in interest. The supposed liens on the lots 
were not annotated on their respective titles. Hence, they should be 
deemed to have acquired the lots free of such encumbrance.
[28]


Third.
 They should not be held liable for interests and penalties
 on late payments which FHHAI was not even authorized to impose in the 
first place. In any event, the rates charged were excessive and 
exorbitant, hence, should be struck down for being contrary to morals.
[29]


Finally.
 The Court of Appeals should not have deleted the award 
of exemplary damages and attorney's fees since the FHHAI itself never 
questioned this award on appeal.
[30]



In its Comment,
[31]
 FHHAI 
counters that Spouses Abayon merely stepped into the shoes of their 
predecessors when they purchased the subject lots. Thus, they assumed 
the obligation to pay for delinquent dues, interests and penalties. It 
is usual practice for subdivision developers to include such stipulation
 in the Deed of Restriction which in turn is annotated on the title of 
the property.
[32]













 
 


As for its power to impose interests and penalties, this is found in Section 10
[33]
 of Republic Act No. 9904
[34]
 on the rights and powers of a homeowners' association. Meanwhile, the 24% 
per annum
 interest rate on late payments and the 8% 
per annum

 penalty are not exorbitant for they serve as effective deterrents 
against non-payment or late payment of association dues. It is essential
 that members pay their dues on time since these revenues are the 
lifeblood of their village.
[35]





More, the Court of Appeals correctly deleted the award for exemplary 
damages and attorney's fees. This was the necessary consequence of the 
dismissal of the complaint of Spouses Abayon.
[36]



Finally, the finding of the Court of Appeals that there was actual 
compliance with the requirements under the 2011 Revised Rules of 
Procedure of the HLURB is correct.
[37]


In their subsequent reply, Spouses Abayon posit
[38]

 that there is no categorical provision in the Deed of Restriction 
obligating the buyers to pay the association dues, interests, and 
penalties which had already accrued prior to their acquisition of the 
lots concerned.
[39]




G.R. No. 230426



FHHAI, too, assails the dispositions of the Court of Appeals insofar as 
it reduced the interest and penalties imposed against Spouses Abayon. It
 cites jurisprudence where the Court did not reduce the 24% interest and
 12% penalty per annum imposed on defaulted loans. Thus, its imposition 
of 24% interest and 8% penalty per annum could not be considered 
exorbitant and iniquitous.
[40]
 Spouses Abayon, on the other hand, maintain otherwise.
[41]


Threshold Issues


Did FHHAI comply with the bond requirement under the 2011 Revised Rules of Procedure of the HLURB?




Are Spouses Abayon liable for association dues which accrued prior to their acquisition of the lots?




Are Spouses Abayon liable for interests and penalties on late payment of association dues? If so, at what rates?




Are Spouses Abayon entitled to damages and attorney's fees?



Ruling



We deny the petitions.






FHHAI complied with the bond requirement under the HLURB rules


 








Disposing of the procedural issue first, we agree with the Court of 
Appeals that FHHAI actually complied with the bond requirement under 
Section 52, Rule 14 of the 2011 Revised Rules of Procedure of the HLURB.
 As borne in the records, the Supersedeas Bond
[42]

 dated July 25, 2014 was jointly signed by FHHAI President Atty. Felipe 
P. Cruz (Atty. Felipe) and Edwin V. Salvan, representing the bonding 
company.



Though Atty. Felipe admitted that he initially failed to sign the 
endorsement portion of the Supersedeas Bond through inadvertence, he 
later corrected this omission and attached copies of the duly signed 
Supersedeas Bond to FHHAI's Comment (to the motion for leave to file 
supplemental counter memorandum)
[43]

 before the HLURB Board of Commissioners. Spouses Abayon were served 
copy of said Comment. Thus, the defects earlier noted by the HLURB 
Commissioners had already been cured.






Spouses Abayon are liable for association dues which accrued prior to their acquisition of Lots 1, 3, 4 and 5.


 







The Court of Appeals did not err when it reversed the rulings of the 
HLURB and dismissed Spouses Abayon's claim for reimbursement. This 
ruling is in accordance with Ferndale Home's Deed of Restrictions which 
Spouses Abayon had notice of when they acquired the lots.



At the outset, we clarify that though Spouses Abayon question the 
imposition of interests and penalties on the late payment of association
 dues on Lots 1 to 8, they are only claiming the refund of association 
dues on Lots 1, 3, 4 and 5.
[44]


 

To recall, Salud purchased Lot 1 from Ayala Land, Inc. under Deed of Absolute Sale
[45]
 dated February 16, 2004 and Lot 3 from Fern Realty Corporation under Deed of Absolute Sale
[46]
 dated August 11, 2003. Meanwhile, Castro purchased Lot 5 from Ayala Land, Inc. under Deed of Absolute Sale
[47]
 dated May 13, 2003. These deeds uniformly ordain:
[48]


6. Title and Ownership


The title, right and interest to be conveyed shall be subject to
 the provisions of Presidential Decree No, 957, as amended, [and] its implementing regulations, 
the
 Deed of Restrictions, the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws of 
the HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION for the project to be organized by the 
SELLER pursuant to Section 11 (the "Association") its rules and 
regulations
, zoning regulations, other restrictions on the use of 
the Lot as may be imposed by governmental and other authorities having 
jurisdiction over them, and the restrictions and easements of record, by
 
all of which the PURCHASER hereby agrees to be bound
.


x x x x


9. HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION


x x x x


9.2. From the date at which the Association have been organized and the 
PURCHASER shall have paid in full the purchase price of the Lot, the 
PURCHASER
 shall automatically become a member of the Association, shall pay to 
the latter all the dues and assessments duly levied and imposed, and 
shall comply with its Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and rules and 
regulations
. (Emphases supplied)



A similar restriction on ownership is reflected on the Deed of Absolute Sale
[49]
 dated October 15, 2004 between Ayala Land, Inc. and Spouses Abayon concerning Lot 4, thus:


This sale is 
subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and other limitations provided for in the
 Contract to Sell, 
Deed Restrictions, the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Homeowners' Association

 to be organized at a later date, the rules and regulations thereof and 
any amendments to the foregoing. This sale is likewise subject to the 
provisions of Presidential Decree No. 957, as amended, and its 
implementing regulations. the provisions of such other laws which are 
pertinent or applicable to subdivision projects, zoning regulations, 
restrictions imposed with respect to the use and occupancy of the unit 
and/or lot herein purchased as may be imposed by the government and 
other authorities having jurisdiction thereon, and the restrictions, 
limitations and easements of record. (emphasis added)








 
 


As stated, the titles and rights of Salud to Lots 1 and 3, and Castro, 
to Lot 5, as well as Spouses Abayon's title and rights to Lot 4 were 
subject to the conditions contained in Ferndale Homes' Deed of 
Restrictions. Among these conditions is the payment of association dues,
 
viz
.:
[50]


THE FERNDALE HOMES ASSOCIATION


The Owner shall automatically be a member of the Association. No other 
person shall be a member of the Association. Membership in the 
Association shall not be transferable separately from the Lot to which 
it pertains.


The Owner must abide by the rules and regulations laid down by the Association
 in the interest of sanitation, security, aesthetics and the general welfare of the community. 
The Association is authorized to collect dues or make assessments to meet its expenses, 
which will constitute as a lien on the property
,
 junior only to liens of the government for taxes and voluntary 
mortgages for sufficient consideration entered into in good faith.
 
Each Owner shall be required the Association of the sale or lease of his
 Lot to another party within fifteen (15) days from the date of 
execution of the contract covering such sale or lease. (emphasis and 
underscoring supplied)




Verily, association dues are collectible against the registered owner of
 Ferndale properties. Should an owner fail to pay his or her association
 dues, such dues become liens on the property in favor of FHHAI. 
People v. Togonon
[51]
 elucidated on the concept of a lien, thus:


A "lien" is a charge on property usually for the payment of 
some debt or obligation. A "lien" is a qualified right or a proprietary 
interest, which may be exercised over the property of another. It is a 
right which the law gives to have a debt satisfied out of a particular 
thing.



As liens, unpaid association dues attach to the properties themselves, 
regardless of whoever is their owner. When said properties get 
transferred, the liens remain but the obligation to pay them is 
transferred to the new owner.





Here, Lot 4 had unpaid association dues before Spouses Abayon acquired 
it on October 15, 2004. It is also undisputed that Salud and Castro 
neglected to pay association dues from the first quarter of 2004 to 
March 17, 2005 for Lot 1, and from the fourth quarter of 2003 to March 
17, 2005 for Lots 3 and 5. These unpaid association dues constituted 
liens on Lots 1, 3, 4, and 5 - liens which remained subsisting when 
Spouses Abayon subsequently acquired these lots on October 15, 2004 and 
March 18, 2005, respectively. FHHAI was well within its right when it 
enforced the liens by collecting the unpaid association dues from 
Spouses Abayon.





Spouses Abayon nevertheless day liability on ground that their titles to
 the lots were allegedly free of any annotation in relation to the 
supposed lien.



 




We are not convinced.



Preliminarily, we note that Spouses Abayon failed to attach to their 
petition here copies of their titles to the subject lots. Thus, the 
Court cannot ascertain whether said titles were indeed free of any lien 
or encumbrance as Spouses Abayon claim them to be.



At any rate, the following circumstances preclude Spouses Abayon from denying knowledge of the existing liens.


First.
 Spouses Abayon knew as early as October 8, 2004, before 
they acquired Lots 1, 3, 4, and 5, that ownership rights over to the 
lots in Ferndale Homes are subject to the terms and conditions in the 
Deed of Restrictions, including the attachment of liens on properties 
for unpaid association dues.



To be sure, Lots 1, 3, 4, and 5 were 
not
 Spouses Abayon's first 
properties in Ferndale Homes. They earlier purchased Lot 6 directly from
 Fern Realty on October 8, 2004 while they acquired Lot 4 on October 15,
 2004 and Lots 1, 3 and 5 on March 18, 2005 only.





As borne by the Deed of Absolute Sale
[52]
 dated October 8, 2004 between Fern Realty Corporation and Spouses Abayon over Lot 6:


This sale is subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and other limitations provided for in the Contract to Sell, 
Deed Restrictions
,
 the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Homeowners' 
Association to be organized at a later date, the rules and regulations 
thereof and any amendments to the foregoing.
 This sale is likewise 
subject to the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 957, as amended, 
and its implementing regulations, the provisions of such other laws 
which are pertinent or applicable to subdivision projects, zoning 
regulations, restrictions imposed with respect to the use and occupancy 
of the unit and/or lot herein purchased as may be imposed by the 
government and other authorities having jurisdiction thereon, and the 
restrictions, limitations and easements of record. (emphasis and 
underscoring supplied)



Verily, Spouses Abayon are charged with knowledge of the Deed of 
Restrictions, including its contents and effects, prior to their 
acquisition of Lots 1, 3, 4 and 5. This should have impelled them to 
inquire on whether the lots they bartered with Salud and Castro, as well
 as the lot they purchased from Ayala were subject to the same 
restrictions. Had Spouses Abayon inspected the Deed of Absolute Sale of 
subject lots in favor of Salud and Castro, they would have discovered 
that the rights of these fanner owners, were also subject to the Deed of
 Restrictions in the same way that their ownership over Lot 6 was so 
restricted.


Second.
 Spouses Abayon would have discovered the existing liens 
had they exercised the prudence and due diligence expected of a buyer in
 good faith before acquiring Lots 1, 3, 4, and 5. 
Dy v. Aldea
[53]
 is apropos:


The prudence required of a buyer in good faith is not that 
of a person with training in law, but rather that of an average man who 
'weighs facts and circumstances without resorting to the calibration of 
our technical rules of evidence of which his knowledge is nil.' A buyer 
in good faith does his homework and verifies that the particulars are in
 order - such as the title, the parties, the mode of transfer and the 
provisions in the deed/contract of sale, to name a few. To be more 
specific, such prudence can be shown by making an ocular inspection of 
the property, checking the title/ownership with the proper Register of 
Deeds alongside the payment of taxes therefor, or inquiring into the 
minutiae such as the parameters or lot area, the type of ownership, and 
the capacity of the seller to dispose of the property, which capacity 
necessarily includes an inquiry into the civil status of the seller to 
ensure that if married, marital consent is secured when necessary. In 
fine, for a purchaser of a property in the possession of another to be 
in good faith, he must exercise due diligence, conduct an investigation,
 and weigh the surrounding facts and circumstances like what any prudent
 man in a similar situation would do.



Here, the requirement of due diligence on the part of Spouses Abayon 
necessarily included an inquiry with FHHAI as regards the status of the 
lots they sought to acquire. Had they exercised due diligence, they 
would have been informed by the association of the existing liens and 
the liability they would incur for the unpaid dues of their 
predecessors-in-interest.




Third.
 Spouses Abayon's rights cannot exceed those of their predecessors-in-interest. This is pursuant to Article 1311
[54]
 of the Civil Code which states that contracts take effect between the parties 
and their assigns
.





The spring cannot rise higher than its source. No one can transfer to 
another a right greater than that which one has. Consequently, just as 
Salud and Castro's ownership rights over Lots 1, 3 and 5 were subject to
 the Deed of Restrictions, so too, must be rights of their subsequent 
owners in the person of Spouses Abayon.


Finally.
 Any claim for reimbursement Spouses Abayon may have for 
paying the unpaid dues attached to Lots 1, 3, and 5 should be directed 
at Salud and Castro, not FHHAI. This is clear under the Deed of Exchange
 dated March 18, 2005, 
viz
.:
[55]




BOTH PARTIES HEREBY warrant unto the other, full title and 
ownership over their respective real properties, with the right to 
dispose of the same, 
free from all liens and encumbrances of whatever nature, in favor or any person or entity
. (emphasis supplied)




As for Lot 4, suffice it to state that Spouses Abayon agreed to be bound
 by the terms and conditions embodied in the Deed of Restrictions, 
including the provision on liens, when they signed the Deed of Absolute 
Sale dated October 15, 2004.



All told, the Court of Appeals did not commit any reversible error when 
it dismissed Spouses Abayon's plea for reimbursement. Considering, too, 
that Spouses Abayon's claim for reimbursement has no leg to stand on, 
the Court of Appeals likewise properly deleted the award of exemplary 
damages and attorney's fees.






The Court of Appeals correctly reduced the interests and penalties imposed


 







FHHAI had authority to impose interests and penalties for late payment 
of association dues. As stated in the Deed of Restrictions, the lot 
owners agree to "abide by the rules and regulations laid down by the 
[Homeowners] Association". Meanwhile, FHHAI had been imposing interests 
and penalties on late payments of association dues as early as August 9,
 2002.
[56]
 Its House Rules pertinently reads:


21. ASSESSMENT


21.1 All homeowners and/or lessees shall be proportionately liable for 
the common expenses which shall be assessed quarterly against each one 
of them and paid to the Homeowner's Association.


21.2. Late payment of accounts of members shall be charged an interest 
rate of 24% per annum. In addition, a penalty at the rate of 8% per 
annum shall be charged on delinquent accounts. The 24% interest shall be
 imposed on paid accounts on the 21
st
 day of the 
corresponding quarter until fully paid. The 8% penalty shall be imposed 
on delinquent accounts starting [on the] first day of the succeeding 
quarter until fully paid.


x x x x


Contrary to FHHAI's claim, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 9904 could not
 have been the source of FHHAI's right to impose interests and penalties
 in 2003 since said law only became effective on January 7, 2010. Be 
that as it may, the House Rules, by itself, already constitutes 
sufficient basis for FHHAI to impose interests and penalties.



As for the amount of interests and penalties, we agree with the Court of
 Appeals that the 24% interest and 8% penalty must be reduced to 12% and
 6% per annum, respectively. Article 1229 of the Civil Code ordains:


Article 1229.
 The judge shall equitably reduce the 
penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly 
complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no performance, the 
penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or 
unconscionable.





In 
MCMP Construction. Co. v. Monark Equipment Corp.
,
[57]
 the Court found the stipulated interest of 24% 
per annum
 and penalty of 3% per month (equivalent to 36% 
per annum
) to be highly unconscionable and exorbitant. Hence, the Court reduced these rates to 12% and 6% 
per annum
, respectively.





Verily, the reduction made by the Court of Appeals is in accordance with
 law and jurisprudence. Spouses Abayon, therefore, are entitled to a 
refund of the interests and penalties they paid for Lots 1 to 8 in 
excess of these reduced rates. More, the amounts they are entitled to 
recover shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision 
until fully paid pursuant to 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
.
[58]
 The ruling of the Court of Appeals should therefore be modified in this respect.


ACCORDINGLY
, the petitions are 
DENIED
, for utter lack of 
merit. The Decision dated August 9, 2016 and Resolution dated March 8, 
2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 137780 are hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
.



The interest rate for late payments of 24% per annum and penalty charge of 8% 
per annum
 are 
REDUCED to twelve percent (12%) and six percent (6%) 
per annum
, respectively. Consequently, Ferndale Homes Homeowners Association Inc. is 
ORDERED
 to 
REIMBURSE

 Spouses Harlin and Daryl Grace Abayon of the interests and penalties 
previously paid for Lots 1 to 8 in excess of these new reduced rates.



The case is 
REMANDED
 to the HLURB National Capital Region Field Office for computation of the reimbursable amount. This amount shall earn 
six percent (6%) interest 
per annum
 from finality of this Decision until fully paid.



All other claims for reimbursement, damages, and attorney 's fees are 
DISMISSED
.

Article 1311.
 
Contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns and heirs,
 except in case where the rights and obligations arising from the 
contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by 
provision of law. The heir is not liable beyond the value of the 
property he received from the decedent.


If a contract should contain some stipulation in favor of a third 
person, he may demand its fulfillment provided he communicated his 
acceptance to the obligor before its revocation. A mere incidental 
benefit or interest of a person is not sufficient. The contracting 
parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon a 
third person.
