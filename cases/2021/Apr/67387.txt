INTING, J.:


This is a Petition for Review
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to set aside the Decision
[2]
 dated April 28, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CV. No. 04344 which affirmed with modification the Decision
[3]

 dated December 16, 2011 of Branch 49, Regional Trial Court (RTC), City 
of Tagbiliran, Bohol in Civil Case No. 5672 declaring Bohol I Electric 
Cooperative (BOHECO) as the true and legal owner of the 5MVA Substation 
Transformer 13.2/7.62/4.16 KV with SN-540808001 (subject transformer).
 
The Antecedents


 The case stemmed from a complaint for recovery of possession and payment of back rentals filed by BOHECO against NAPOCOR.
 NAPOCOR filed a third-party complaint against NEA as the third-party defendant. 
 The complaint alleged the following: 
 On September 13, 1979, BOHECO received a radio message from one Director Santos of NEA, stating: 
  


 "REUR AVAILABLE 5 MVA SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER PD REQUEST ALLOW 
PERSONNEL OF NPC TO BORROW SAID TRANSFORMER FOR THEIR TONGONAN 
GEOTHERMAL PLANT IN ORMOC PD END


 DIRECTOR SANTOS"
[4]
 




 Thereafter, NAPOCOR's Engineer Virgilio Ungab (Engr. Ungab) 
prepared a requisition voucher for "One (1) set of Substation 
Transformer, 5MVA 15.2/7.62/4.16 KV complete with SN-540808001, dated 
1972 and its accessories"
[5]
 
which BOHECO's Acting General Manager Melchor B. Bobis (GM Bobis) 
approved. A handwritten note located at the lower left portion of the 
voucher reads, "[s]ubject to NEA, NPC & BOHECO I negotiations."
[6]

 On September 14, 1979, another requisition voucher was prepared 
requesting for some materials or supplies for "NPC, Tongonan, Ormoc 
City," which GM Bobis likewise approved. BOHECO's Warehouseman B.C. 
Angcahan then issued a material charge ticket for the same 
materials/supplies which Engr. Ungab received. The same persons issued 
and received, respectively, another material charge ticket to which a 
typewritten note reads, "[s]ubject to NEA, NPC & BOHECO I 
Negotiation."
[7]
 On 
March 26, 1985, BOHECO's Officer-in-Charge Engineer Carlos B. Itable 
(Engr. Itable) wrote a letter to Mr. Romeo A. Perlado (Mr. Perlado), 
NAPOCOR's Regional Manager for the Visayas Utility Operations, reminding
 him about the subject transformer and notifying him that there was 
nothing in BOHECO's records showing of any agreement  between 	NEA 	and 
	NAPOCOR 	regarding 	the 	subject transformer. He also asked for 
possible rental payment as compensation for the depreciation of the 
subject transformer's value. On April 20, 1985, BOHECO sent a telegram 
to Mr. Perlado asking for copies of all documents pertinent to NEA and 
NAPOCOR's agreement concerning the replacement of the latter's 5MVA 
substation transformer and reiterating its request for rental payment. 
The request fell on deaf ears. Hence, BOHECO's complaint.
[8]
 In its answer, NAPOCOR averred the following:

 NAPOCOR's possession of the subject transformer was legitimate from the
 very beginning as it was NEA's replacement of its transformer that was 
withdrawn from NAPOCOR's Tongonan power plant in Leyte. It relied on 
NEA's authority to validly and legally transfer ownership and possession
 of the subject transformer without obligations or conditions on its 
part. BOHECO did not make any objection or protest when the subject 
transformer was pulled out from its office in 1981.
[9]
 

 NAPOCOR had been in open, notorious, and uninterrupted possession of 
the subject transformer. As its defense, it stressed that BOHECO's right
 to enforce its claim had already prescribed; and that the complaint 
failed to comply with the Court's Administrative Circular No. 04-94
[10]
 regarding the additional requirements concerning the filing of petitions in the Supreme Court and the CA.
[11]

 Thereafter, NAPOCOR filed a motion for leave to file third-party 
complaint against NEA alleging that it acquired possession of the 
subject transformer through the latter's directives and maintained that 
the subject transformer was a replacement of its own transformer which 
was withdrawn by NEA.
[12]

 BOHECO, in its answer to the affirmative defense, averred that NAPOCOR 
merely borrowed the subject transformer; that whatever contract NAPOCOR 
had with NEA, it was not a party to it; and that while NAPOCOR came into
 possession of the subject transformer lawfully, its possession, 
however, became adversarial after Antonio Corpuz, NAPOCOR's 
Vice-President, insisted that the subject transformer was swapped for 
NAPOCOR's own 3MVA substation transformer. 
 NEA, in its answer to the third-party complaint alleged the following: 

 The parties' cause of action had already prescribed and barred by 
laches. NEA stressed that BOHECO and NAPOCOR took approximately 16 years
 before filing their respective complaints; that recovery of possession 
of movable personal property acquired in good faith prescribes in four 
years; and if in bad faith, the action prescribes in eight years. 
NAPOCOR had no cause of action against it for failure to exhaust all 
administrative remedies mandated by Presidential Decree No. (PD) 242,
[13]

 which prescribes the procedure for administrative settlement of 
disputes, claims, and controversies between and among government 
offices, including government-owned and -controlled corporations.
[14]

 On June 24, 1996, the RTC found merit in NEA's motion to dismiss the 
third-party complaint. Accordingly, the Third-party Complaint was 
dismissed. However, on October 15, 1996, upon NAPOCOR's motion for 
reconsideration, the RTC granted NAPOCOR's motion on the ground that NEA
 failed to file an opposition to NAPOCOR's amended motion for 
reconsideration.
[15]
 Trial on the merits ensued. 
 
Evidence for BOHECO


 Engr. Itable's testimony is as follows: 
 BOHECO owns 
the subject transformer, which is presently in the possession of 
NAPOCOR. It was by reason of a radio message sent by NEA directing 
BOHECO to accommodate NAPOCOR's request to borrow the subject 
transformer that it came to the possession of NAPOCOR. Pertinent 
documents like requisition vouchers and material charge tickets were 
prepared, approved, and signed by the concerned officials or 
representatives.
[16]
 
BOHECO acquired the subject transformer at the price of P712,221.38. At 
the time the subject transformer was released to NAPOCOR, BOHECO was 
still paying the monthly amortizations to NEA. At present, the subject 
transformer would already cost P3 to 4 Million.
[17]
 It was Engr. Ungab of NAPOCOR who pulled out the subject transformer from BOHECO's office on September 18, 1979.

 On March 26, 1985, Engr. Itable wrote a letter addressed to NAPOCOR 
asking rental payment for the use of the subject transformer. It was 
followed by a telegram dated April 22, 1985, this time addressed to 
NAPOCOR and NEA, asking for a copy of the agreement between the two 
regarding the subject transformer, but to no avail.
[18]

 On April 29, 1985, Engr. Itable wrote a letter to NEA's Cooperative 
Administrator, Gen. Pedro G. Dumol. On June 15, 1987, he wrote another 
letter addressed to Engr. Teodulo J. Pinlac of NAPOCOR in Tagbilaran 
City. He likewise sent a letter to the General Manager of LEYECO V in 
Ormoc City, who received the subject transformer. On January 21, 1991, 
he wrote a response letter to the letter of NAPOCOR's Vice-President. On
 July 4, 1994, he wrote a letter to NAPOCOR's Vice-President for the 
Visayas requesting for a replacement of the subject transformer as there
 were areas in Bohol that were encountering low voltage; however, the 
request was denied.
[19]
 

 In his recollection of events, Engr. Itable said that BOHECO passed 
Resolution No. 13, Series of 1986, addressed to NEA, seeking assistance 
for the recovery of the subject transformer. Then, on April 4, 1987, 
another board resolution was passed demanding from NAPOCOR the return of
 the subject transformer. Likewise, demands for payment of rental in the
 amount of P10,000.00 per month were made.
[20]
 
Evidence for NAPOCOR


 NAPOCOR presented Engr. Ungab, Engr. Alfredo 	Tumagan (Engr. Tumagan), and Engr. Ernesto Oreiro
[21]
 (Engr. Oreiro).

 In his testimony, Engr. Ungab stated that he was instructed to pull out
 the subject transformer from BOHECO and to ship it to Tongonan, Ormoc 
City. BOHECO did not react to the pulling out of the subject transformer
 when it was told that the order came from the "higher-ups." The reason 
for the palling out of the subject transformer was to save on the cost 
of shipping; that instead of shipping BOHECO's transformer to Masbate, 
it was NAPOCOR's transformer that was shipped to Masbate and BOHECO's 
transformer was the one shipped to Tongonan. He insisted that NAPOCOR 
has its own supply of transformers that makes it unnecessary to borrow 
transformers from BOHECO. He clarified that Masbate Electric Cooperative
 (MASELCO) and BOHECO are separate and distinct cooperatives, but both 
are under NEA.
[22]
 Engr. Tumagan corroborated Engr. Ungab's testimony. 

 Further, Engr. Oreiro testified that he did not see any document 
relating to the subject transformer, but knows only of the verbal 
instructions coming from the "higher-ups." NAPOCOR does not borrow, 
lease, or has ever borrowed or leased any equipment in the construction 
or operation of its power plant because NAPOCOR, in itself, installs 
transformers. He was involved in the installation of the subject 
transformer, but he was not in Bohol to witness its pulling out and 
shipment. The subject transformer is still in Tongonan and is still 
operational.
[23]
 
Sometime in 1999, BOHECO asked NAPOCOR for rental payment for the use of
 the subject transformer, but the latter did not pay because of the 
internal agreement entered into by and between NAPOCOR and NEA to swap 
NAPOCOR's 3MVA transformer with BOHECO's 5MVA transformer. He confirmed 
that a 5MVA transformer is valued more than a 3MVA transformer; that a 
5MVA transformer would roughly cost around P100,000.00, but as to its 
present value, he could not give an estimate because he was only 
involved in the operation and maintenance of the plant; and that he was 
not familiar with the charge sheet or receipt where the value of the 
5MVA transformer was indicated.
[24]
 
Evidence for NEA


 NEA presented BOHECO's witness, Engr. Oreiro as its hostile 
witness to prove that contrary to his testimony, there was no swapping 
of transformers that happened between BOHECO and NAPOCOR. As a hostile 
witness, he reiterated his statement that he only assisted in the 
installation of the subject transformer; neither did he receive the 
subject transformer when it arrived in Tongonan. Moreover, he confirmed 
that the transfer of the subject transformer was upon the instruction of
 his plant manager in BOHECO, who, on other other hand, received an 
instruction from NAPOCOR's Regional Office in Cebu.
[25]
 
Ruling of the RTC


 On December 16, 2011, the RTC rendered a Decision
[26]

 in favor of BOHECO. It declared that BOHECO was entitled to the 
restoration of the subject transformer which was unlawfully withheld 
from it. It also ordered the payment of back rentals in arrears for the 
use of the subject transformer.
 The 
fallo
 of the Decision reads: 
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:








1.


Declaring the plaintiff 
in the instant case, BOHECO, as the true and legal owner of the 5MVA 
"Substation Transformer 13.2/7.62/4.16 KV with SN-540808001; 






 


 






2.


 
Directing and Ordering defendant, 
the National Power Corporation (NPC), to return forthwith to BOHECO, 
possession, custody and control of the above-adverted 5MVA Substation 
Transformer 13.2/7.62/4.16 KV with SN-540808001, which it has illegally 
retained;






 


 






3.


Directing and Ordering third-party 
plaintiff, the NPC and the third-party defendant, the National 
Electrification Administration (NEA) to pay BOHECO, jointly and 
severally, the sum of Four Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P450,000.00), 
representing the sought (sic) for back rentals and attorney's fees 
equivalent to 20% of the stated amount and the costs of the suit.








All other claims are hereby DISMISSED. 


SO ORDERED.
[27]
 




 Both NAPOCOR and NEA appealed to the CA. 
 
Ruling of the CA


 On April 28, 2017, the CA rendered the assailed Decision
[28]
 denying the appeal of NAPOCOR, but granting the appeal of NEA. 

 The CA affirmed the RTC Decision with modification in that it deleted 
the award of attorney's fees. It further found NAPOCOR as the only 
liable party for the payment of rentals in arrears reckoned from the 
time the subject transformer was pulled out from BOHECO's office until 
NAPOCOR surrenders it to BOHECO. It furthermore imposed legal interest 
on NAPOCOR's obligation following the ruling in 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.
[29]
  (Nacar). 
 The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: 
  


 WHEREFORE, NAPOCOR's appeal is DENIED and NEA's appeal is 
GRANTED. The Decision dated 16 De ember 2011 of the Regional Trial 
Court, 7
th
 Judicial Region, Branch 49, City of Tagbilaran, in
 Civil Case No. 5672, is hereby AFFIRMED with modification deleting the 
award of attorney's fees; finding only the National Power Corporation 
(NAPOCOR) liable for payment of rentals-in-arrears from the time it 
pulled-out the subject substation transformer until it surrenders the 
same to BOHECO; and imposing legal interest on NAPOCOR's obligation. In 
view of the foregoing: 






(1)


 
The RTC is DIRECTED to 
appoint, with dispatch, three (3) commissioners for the purpose of 
determining the reasonable and fair rent on the subject substation 
transformer. 






 


 






(2)


NAPOCOR is DIRECTED to surrender to BOHECO the subject substation transformer, within fifteen (15) days from notice hereof.






 


 






(3)


Legal interest is imposed on NAPOCOR's obligation with BOHECO, computed as follows, 
viz
 -






 


 


 








(i)


 
12% interest per 
annum
 shall be imposed on the total obligation computed from June 26, 1985, until June 30, 2013; 






 


 


 








(ii)


 
6% interest per 
annum
 from July 1, 2013, until finality of this judgment; and






 


 


 








(iii)


the total amount of the obligation, inclusive [of] the interest, shall earn interest at 6% per 
annum
, from finality of this decision until full payment thereof. 








SO ORDERED.
[30]




 Hence, the instant petition. 
 NAPOCOR raises a sole ground for consideration of the Court, to wit:
  


 THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT NPC ALONE IS LIABLE 
FOR PAYMENT OF RENTALS-IN-ARREARS TO BOHECO UN THE GROUND THAT NEA 
ALLEGEDLY DID NOT EVEN BENEFIT FROM THE USE OF THE SUBJECT SUBSTATION 
TRANSFORMER CONTRARY TO THE FINDING OF THE TRIAL COURT AND THE ADMISSION
 OF BOHECO ITSELF, THAT BOTH NPC AND NEA BENEFIT[T]ED FROM THE USE OF 
THE SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER 
[31]




 
The Petition


 NAPOCOR maintains that the CA erred in holding it solely liable for payment of rentals in arrears to BOHECO.
[32]

 It argues that based on the evidence presented, it appears that its 
possession of the subject transformer is legitimate from the very 
beginning because it was upon NEA's directive that it pulled out the 
subject transformer from BOHECO as a replacement of its 3MVA 
transformer, which was transferred to MASELCO.
[33]
 NAPOCOR stresses the full authority of NEA over all electric cooperatives pursuant to PD 269
[34]
 to justify its possession and exercise of control over the subject transformer.
[35]
 On the question of what happened to the subject transformer of BOHECO, Engr. Tumagan testified in this manner: 
  


 x x x "Because there was a plan of National Electrification 
Administration (NEA) to transfer the 5MVA to Masbate. But they agreed 
that in order to lessen the expenses of the National Electrification 
Administration (NEA), National Power Corporation (NPC) will be the one 
to get the transformer from Bohol to Leyte. And the transformer of NPC 
at Leyte will be brought to Masbate in order to lessen the expenses 
because from Leyte is nearer to Masbate compared to Bohol."
[36]




 NAPOCOR asserts that it would not have taken possession of the subject transformer had there been no order from NEA.
[37]

 Thus, as a possessor in good faith, NAPOCOR insists that it is entitled
 to all the fruits of the subject property and is not under obligation 
to pay any rentals thereof.
[38]

 Further, NAPOCOR believes that NEA benefitted from the use of the 
subject transformer because per testimony of Engr. Itable, BOHECO 
continued to pay the monthly amortizations to NEA even after NAPOCOR 
already pulled out the subject transformer from BOHECO. Hence, by 
BOHECO's continued payment to NEA, the latter gained benefits from the 
subject transformer even if it was in the possession of NAPOCOR.
[39]
 
BOHECO's Comment


 BOHECO argues that the CA erred in holding NAPOCOR as solely 
liable for the payment of rentals in arrears. BOHECO asserts that the 
RTC was correct when it declared that NAPOCOR and NEA were jointly 
liable for payment of reasonable rentals of the subject transformer 
because both gained benefits from the use of the subject 
transformerâNAPOCOR has the subject transformer under its possession and
 is exercising dominion over it; while NEA was continuously accepting 
payments for the subject transformer from BOHECO even after it was 
pulled out from the latter's office and transferred to NAPOCOR in Leyte.
[40]
 
NEA's Comment/Opposition


 NEA insists on the following: NAPOCOR presented no evidence to
 prove that NEA instructed it to take the subject transformer from 
BOHECO's office.
[41]
 The only 
proof NAPOCOR presented was a handwritten marginal note in the 
requisition voucher stating "subject to NEA, NPC, and BOHECO I 
Negotiations
[42]
 without bearing a signature coming from NEA's representative.
[43]
 The phrase "to negotiate" means that there is no agreement that has been reached yet;
[44]
 and that pending negotiation, there is no agreement or decision that exists to bind the parties.
[45]

 NEA maintains that Engr. Tumagan of NAPOCOR testified that there was 
only a plan to transfer the subject transformer from BOHECO to NAPOCOR.
[46]

 NEA further argues that the testimonies made by NAPOCOR's witnesses 
were made true by BOHECO's letter dated March 26, 1985 addressed to Mr. 
Perlado, who was then Regional Manager of Visayas Utility Operations of 
NAPOCOR which reads, "
since September 1979 when it was withdrawn by 
Engr. Virgilio Ungab for shipment to Tongonan, Leyte geothermal plant 
and we cannot find in our record of any written conditions between the 
[NPC] and the [NEA] regarding its transfer x x x
."
[47]
 Hence, NEA maintains that NAPOCOR's claim is just a bare allegation not supported by evidence or by law.
[48]
 
NAPOCORâs Consolidated Reply


 NAPOCOR reiterates, among others, the RTC's findings that it 
acquired custody, control, and possession of the subject transformer by 
virtue of NEA's directive.
[49]
 Thus, it is wrong for the CA to rule that the payment of the back rentals was NAPOCOR's sole liability.
[50]

 Further, NAPOCOR claims that NEA cannot simply escape liability by 
denying participation in the transaction on the ground that there is no 
written document to prove its claims.
[51]
 
Issue


 Did the CA  err in holding NAPOCOR solely liable for the 
payment of rentals in arrears to BOHECO on the ground that NEA did not 
benefit from the use of the subject transformer?
 
The Court's Ruling


 The Court denies the petition. 
 At the outset, there is
 no more question as to which entity owns the subject transformer. Both 
the RTC and the CA aptly ruled that BOHECO owns it. It is likewise 
beyond question that the possession and control of the subject 
transformer was transferred to NAPOCOR. The manner by which the subject 
transformer was transferred to the latter is established by reason of a 
radio message sent to and received by the General Manager of BOHECO from
 NEA's Director, which reads: 
  


 "REUR AVAILABLE 5MVA SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER PD REQUEST ALLOW 
PERSONNEL OF NPC TO BORROW SAID TRANSFORMER FOR THEIR TONGONAN 
GEOTHERMAL PLANT IN ORMOC PD END


 DIRECTOR SANTOS"
[52]




 Further, the transfer of the subject transformer to NAPOCOR does 
not mean that its ownership was likewise transferred to NAPOCOR. 
Notably, there is a complete absence of records that will support 
NAPOCOR's allegation that ownership over the subject transformer was 
also transferred in its favor. Thus, the Court quotes with approval the 
finding of the CA, to wit: 
  


 It is beyond dispute that plaintiff BOHECO, the owner of the 
5MVA Substation Transformer 13.2/7.62/4.16 KV with SN-540808001, subject
 of the instant case, was since 1979 been deprived of custody, control 
and possession of subject transformer. It is not disputed further, 
having judicially admitted such fact, that the subject transformer owned
 by BOHECO, is within the custody, control and possession of third-party
 plaintiff, the NPC installed as its Tongonan Geothermal Plant in Ormoc 
for the Leyte-Samar Grid.
[53]




 Verily, the action for recovery of possession and for payment of 
back rentals against NAPOCOR is proper. Following the declaration that 
the ownership of the subject transformer belongs and still remains with 
BOHECO, both the CA and the RTC are correct in directing NAPOCOR to 
surrender the possession, custody, and control of the subject 
transformer to BOHECO. 
 Accordingly, BOHECO is entitled to the 
payment of rentals-in-arrears from the time the subject transformer was 
pulled out from its premises until NAPOCOR surrenders it to the former. 
 Who then is liable for the payment of rentals in arrears? 

 The RTC declared that NAPOCOR and NEA should pay BOHECO, jointly and 
severally, the sum of P450,000.00 representing the back rentals and 
attorney's fees equivalent to 20% of the stated amount.
[54]


On appeal, the CA ruled that only NAPOCOR is liable.   
  
 NAPOCOR insists that NEA should be solely liable reiterating 
its claim that its possession of the subject transformer is legitimate 
from the very beginning as it was transferred to its possession and 
control upon NEA's instruction;
[55]

 that it acted in good faith following the instruction from NEA to get 
the subject transformer of BOHECO in exchange for NAPOCOR's own 3MVA 
transformer which, on the other hand, was shipped to MASELCO.
[56]
 
 The Court finds no merit in NAPOCOR's assertions. 
  
There is nothing in the records that would show any written 
agreement between NAPOCOR and NEA regarding the transfer of the 
ownership of the subject transformer to NAPOCOR. 
  
 Well settled is the rule that there is solidary liability only
 when the obligation expressly so states, or when the obligation 
requires solidarity.
[57]
 In 
the case, as correctly found by the CA, other than NEA's radio message 
sent to BOHECO directing the transfer of the subject transformer to 
NAPOCOR, there are no other pieces of evidence presented to prove that 
NEA bound itself with the latter to pay BOHECO for the use of the 
subject transformer.
[58]
 

 The Court likewise adheres to the findings of the CA that the RTC erred
 in concluding that NEA also benefitted from the use of the subject 
transformer.
[59]
 The fact that
 BOHECO was still paying for the monthly amortizations on the subject 
transformer to NEA, even after BOHECO was deprived of possession 
thereof, does not mean that NEA also benefitted from the use of subject 
transformer to make it solidarily liable with NAPOCOR. Further, BOHECO's
 continuous payment of the monthly amortizations to NEA, after 
possession of the subject transformer was transferred to NAPOCOR, only 
proves that BOHECO retained ownership of the subject transformer. 
 Simply put by the CA, "
neither is there any proof to show that NEA had, at one time or another gained possession of the subject transformer
."
[60]
 

 As to the fair and reasonable amount of rental, the Court adopts the 
findings of the CA that the RTC awarded to BOHECO back rentals in the 
amount as prayed for by the latter without even making any findings 
thereon.
[61]
 
Basic 
is the rule that to recover actual damages, not only must the amount of 
loss be capable of proof; it must also be actually proven with a 
reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof or the 
best evidence obtainable
.
[62]
 Thus, the findings of the CA:
  


 More importantly, BOHECO omitted to present any other evidence 
at all on what it considers to be fair rental value by way of 
testimonies of persons who are in the power business/industry to show 
how much the rent is being charged on 5MVA substation transformers, with
 the same specifications as the subject substation transformer, and that
 it is the amount prevailing in the power industry. This way, the courts
 will be aided in arriving with reasonable certainty at the amount of 
rents which BOHECO failed to earn.


 "In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must 
establish his case by preponderance of evidence. He who alleges a fact 
has the burden of proving it and a mere allegation is not evidence." 
Hence, the amount awarded to BOHECO, as payment for rentals, is deleted,
 and accordingly, we remand the case to the RTC to determine, with aid 
of court-appointed commissioners, the fair rental value on the subject 
transformer, from the time it was pulled-out from BOHECO's office until 
NAPOCOR surrenders it to BOHECO. 


 Worth mentioning is that the nature of the funds for 
disbursement is public. As such, the amount of rental must be 
ascertained with absolute certainty and supported by factual and legal 
bases.
[63]
 




 In all, the Court finds that the CA did not err in holding NAPOCOR
 solely liable for the payment of rentals in arrears to BOHECO on the 
ground that it was the only one that benefitted from the use of the 
subject transformer. 
  
 Further, the CA is correct in deleting the award of attorney's
 fees for failure of the RTC to state the grounds to warrant its award 
in BOHECO's favor. Settled is the rule that the lower court must state 
the factual, legal, or equitable justification for the award of 
attorney's fees;
[64]
 that the grant thereof cannot be stated in the dispositive portion of the decision without stating the reasons therefor.
[65]

 In fact, the CA is precluded from supplementing the bases for the award
 of attorney's fees when the lower court failed to provide a discussion 
of the grounds or reasons for the award thereof in its decision.
[66]
 
 As to the imposition of the legal interest, the CA correctly applied the ruling in 
Nacar
, thus: 
  


 Applying the aforestated ruling, NAPOCOR is, therefore, liable for payment of interest, at twelve percent (12%) per 
annum

 computed from March 26, 1985 (date of extrajudicial demand for payment 
of rentals-in-arrears and rentals due in the interim until surrender of 
the subject substation transformer), until June 30, 2013, and from July 
1, 2013, six percent (6%) shall be imposed, until finality of this 
judgment. Furthermore, the total obligation shall, itself, earn interest
 at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from [
sic
] finality of judgment until full payment thereof.
