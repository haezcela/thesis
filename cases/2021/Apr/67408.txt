POWER SECTOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (PSALM), REPRESENTED BY MR. EMMANUEL R. LEDESMA, JR., IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO), AND THE CONCERNED AND AFFECTED OFFICERS OF PSALM, PETITIONERS, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT (COA), RESPONDENT.

LOPEZ, M., J.:


Before this Court are the consolidated Petitions for 
Certiorari
[1]

 under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Revised Rules of Court 
docketed as G.R. No. 213425 and G.R. No. 216606. G.R. No. 213425 assails
 Decision No. 2013-228
[2]
 dated December 23, 2013 and Resolution
[3]

 dated April 4, 2014 of respondent Commission on Audit (COA) in COA CP 
Case No. 2011-144. On the other hand, G.R. No. 216606 questions the 
COA's Resolution
[4]
 dated November 20, 2014 in COA CP Case No. 2010-362.


Facts




Petitioner Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation 
(PSALM) is a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) created 
under Republic Act (RA) No. 9136,
[5]

 also known as the "Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001" (EPIRA).
 Its principal purpose is to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and 
privatization of National Power Corporation (NPC) assets to liquidate 
all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal 
manner.
[6]



Since 2002, PSALM had been reimbursing Extraordinary and Miscellaneous 
Expenses (EME) to its officers and employees with certifications issued 
by the claimant as evidence of disbursement in accordance with Section 
397(c)
[7]
 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM)
[8]
 - Volume I and COA Circular No. 89-300
[9]
 dated March 21, 1989.
[10]
 In a Letter
[11]
 dated August 28, 2008, however, the COA Audit Team Leader reminded PSALM that COA Circular No. 2006-001
[12]

 dated January 3, 2006 no longer allows the use of such certification as
 an alternative supporting document for reimbursement claims of EME and 
other similar expenses. Notably, PSALM and all its departments were 
furnished a copy of COA Circular No. 2006-001 on March 8, 2006,
[13]
 Paragraph III(3) of which provides:





The claim for reimbursement of such expenses shall be supported by 
receipts and/or other document evidencing disbursements
; x x x (Emphasis supplied.)



Despite such advice, PSALM continued to pay out EME in 2008 and 2009, 
supported merely by certifications. Consequently, the disbursed 2008 EME
 became the subject of Notice of Suspension (NS) No. 09-0001-000-(08)
[14]

 dated March 16, 2009 on the ground that they were not supported by 
documents required under COA Circular No. 2006-001. The NS required 
PSALM to submit receipts corresponding to the 2008 EME reimbursements.


Still unwilling to comply, PSALM filed a motion for reconsideration (MR)
 for the lifting of the NS. Unmoved, the Auditor issued Notice of 
Disallowance (ND) No. 09-004-(08)
[15]
 (
2008 EME ND
)
 on December 28, 2009, disallowing the 2008 EME, amounting to an 
aggregate of P2,385,334.06. The approving and certifying officers, as 
well as the individual payees were all made liable to settle the 
disallowed amount.
[16]



On June 2, 2010, a Memorandum on Appeal
[17]
 was filed before the COA Corporate Government Sector (CGS), Cluster B, questioning the 
2008 EME ND
, which was denied in Decision No. 2010-012
[18]
 dated November 25, 2010:



WHEREFORE
, foregoing premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby 
DENIED
 for lack of merit. Accordingly, [ND] No. 09-004-(08) dated December 28, 2009 amounting to P2,385,334.06 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
[19]
 (Emphasis in the original.)



PSALM then filed a Petition for Review
[20]
 of COA CGS Decision No. 2010-012 before the COA Proper on December 28, 2010, which was also denied in 
Decision No. 2013-229
[21]
 dated December 23, 2013:



WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review of [PSALM] and its
 concerned officers is hereby DENIED. Accordingly, [COA CGS]-Cluster B 
Decision No. 2010-012 dated November 25, 2010 and [
2008 EME ND
] 
dated December 28, 2009, on the payment of [EME] to [PSALM] officers for
 the year 2008 in the total amount of [P]2,385,334.06, are hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
[22]
 (Emphasis in the original.)



No MR or petition for 
certiorari
 was filed. Thus, 
Decision No. 2013-229
 became final and executory. A Notice of Finality of Decision
[23]
 (NFD) dated March 6, 2014 was issued and served upon PSALM through a 1
st
 Indorsement.
[24]
 This prompted PSALM to file a Motion for Relief from Judgment and/or to Defer/Suspend Enforcement of Finality of Decision,
[25]
 claiming that its failure to file an MR or a petition for 
certiorari
 was due to an honest mistake, inadvertence, or excusable negligence. Unconvinced, the COA Proper 
En Banc
 issued Resolution
[26]
 dated November 20, 2014, denying PSALM's motion:



"The [COA Proper] dismissed the Urgent Manifestation and 
Motion for having been filed out of time. The Notice of Finality of 
Decision dated March 6, 2014 shall remain in force and effect."
[27]


The COA Proper's Resolution dated November 20, 2014 is now the subject of the Petition for 
Certiorari
 in G.R. No. 216606.




Meanwhile, pending resolution of the 
2008 EME ND
 appeal, ND No. 10-005-(2009) (
2009 EME ND
)
[28]

 dated August 9, 2010 was issued, similarly disallowing the 2009 EME 
reimbursements, amounting to an aggregate of P2,615,500.79, for failure 
to submit the documentary requirements under COA Circular No. 2006-001. 
All the approving/certifying officers and payees of the 2009 EME were 
likewise made liable for the disallowed transactions.
[29]




On February 1, 2011, PSALM filed a Memorandum on Appeal
[30]
 before the COA CGS, Cluster B, challenging the 
2009 EME ND
, but was denied in COA CGS Decision No. 2011-004
[31]
 dated April 13, 2011:



WHEREFORE
, foregoing premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby 
DENIED

 for lack of merit. Accordingly, [ND] No. 10-005-(2009) dated August 9, 
2010 relative to the payment of CY 2009 [EME] to PSALM officials in the 
total amount of [P]2,615,500.79 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
[32]
 (Emphasis in the original.)



On May 4, 2011, PSALM filed a Petition for Review
[33]
 of COA CGS Decision No. 2011-004 before the COA Proper, which was likewise denied in 
Decision No. 2013-228
[34]
 dated December 23, 2013:



WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review of [PSALM] is hereby 
DENIED
. Accordingly, [CGS]-Cluster B Decision No. 2011-004 dated April 13, 2011 and [
2009 EME ND
]
 dated August 9, 2010, on the payment of [EME] to its officials for the 
year 2009 in the total amount of [P]2,615,500.79, are hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
[35]
 (Emphasis in the original.)




Unlike with Decision No. 2013-229, PSALM was able to timely file an MR 
of the COA Proper's Decision No. 2013-228, but it was denied in a 
Resolution
[36]
 dated April 4, 2014:



"The [COA Proper] denied the [MR] for lack of merit. The 
movants failed to raise a new matter or show sufficient ground to 
justify a reconsideration of COA Decision No. 2013-228 dated December 
23, 2013."
[37]


The COA Proper's Decision No. 2013-228 and Resolution dated April 4, 2014 are now the subjects of the Petition for 
Certiorari
 in G.R. No. 213425.




Issues





In G.R. No. 213425, PSALM contends that the COA Proper erred in upholding the 
2009 EME ND
. It claims that its officials and employees' right to due process was violated when the 
2009 EME ND
 was issued without first issuing an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM).
[38]

 PSALM also argues that COA Circular No. 2006-001 is not applicable to 
it because it derives its authority to disburse EME from the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA).
[39]
 As such, it disburses EME in accordance with Section 397(c)
[40]
 of the GAAM,
[41]
 Volume I, citing Paragraph III(4)
[42]
 of COA Circular No. 89-300,
[43]

 which allows national government agencies (NGA) to use certifications, 
in lieu of receipts, as proof of disbursement. Hence, PSALM posits that 
the evil sought to be prevented by the stricter requirement under COA 
Circular No. 2006-001 is already addressed by the ceiling amounts 
provided under the GAA. In any case, PSALM contends that the 
certifications supporting the claims should be considered sufficient as 
they fall under the "other document evidencing disbursements" 
contemplated under paragraph III(3) of COA Circular No. 2006-001.
[44]

 Violation of the equal protection clause was also raised because of the
 alleged preferential treatment given to the NPC and the National 
Transmission Corporation (TransCo) when no disallowance was issued to the
 EMEs that they disbursed, which were merely supported by 
certifications;
[45]
 and also 
due to the difference in treatment between NGAs and GOCCs as NGAs are 
allowed to use certifications under COA Circular No. 89-300.
[46]
 Lastly, PSALM invokes good faith on the part of its officials in approving and receiving the 2009 EME reimbursements.
[47]




In G.R. No. 216606, PSALM argues that the COA gravely abused its 
discretion in denying its motion for relief from judgment and sustaining
 the finality of Decision No. 2013-229. PSALM beseeches the Court to 
brush aside the technical rules of procedure and to review the merits of
 the case.
[48]
 On the merits, PSALM maintains that the COA Proper committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the 
2008 EME ND
, raising the same substantive issues stated above.
[49]
 To synthesize, the issues for our resolution are the following:
    



Whether the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling that due process was not disregarded when the 
2009 EME ND
 was issued without first issuing an AOM;


Whether the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in denying 
PSALM's motion for relief from judgment and declaring Decision No. 
2013-229 as final and executory;


Whether the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the 
2008 EME ND
 and 
2009 EME ND
 or specifically:


Did the COA err in ruling that COA Circular No. 2006-001 applies to PSALM?


Did the COA err in ruling that certifications cannot be 
considered as substantial compliance with the documentary requirement 
under COA Circular No. 2006-001?


 Did the COA err in ruling that there was no violation of the 
equal protection clause when COA auditors allegedly failed to apply COA 
Circular No. 2006-001 to the NPC and TransCo? Was the principle of equal
 protection violated by the difference in treatment between NGAs and 
GOCCs?


Did the COA err in affirming the liability of PSALM's officers and employees to settle the disallowed amounts?





Ruling




We find no merit in both Petitions.
 



The COA's audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms structured 
to ensure the check-and-balance system inherent in our form of 
government. Under the 1987 Constitution,
[50]

 the COA is vested with broad powers over all accounts pertaining to 
government revenues and expenditures, including the exclusive authority 
to promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations for the 
prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, 
extravagant, or unconscionable uses of government funds and properties.
[51]

 As a necessary consequence, the COA's interpretation of its own 
auditing rules and regulations, as enunciated in its decisions, should 
be accorded great weight and respect.
[52]

 It is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of the 
COA, unless it acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave 
abuse of discretion. Congruent with this precept is the limited scope of
 the Court's review under the extraordinary remedy of 
certiorari
,
 wherein the Court is confined solely to questions of jurisdiction 
whenever a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or 
quasi-judicial function acts without jurisdiction or in excess of 
jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction.
[53]
 
Grave abuse of discretion speaks of an evasion of a positive duty or a 
virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in 
contemplation of law as when the judgment rendered is not based on law 
and evidence but on caprice, whim and despotism.
[54]
 As will be discussed, we do not find any COA action in these cases done beyond its jurisdiction or with grave abuse discretion.



I. Right to due process



In G.R. No. 213425, PSALM laments that the Auditor's failure to issue an AOM before the issuance of the 
2009 EME ND
 is a breach of the right to due process. This argument has no legal basis.


We agree with the COA that COA Circular No. 2009-006
[55]

 or the COA Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) does 
not require the issuance of an AOM before a disallowance may be issued. 
Paragraph 5.3 of the RRSA states that an AOM shall be issued only "
[i]n
 case an audit decision cannot as yet be reached due to incomplete 
documentation/information, or if the deficiencies noted refer to 
financial or operational matters which do not involve pecuniary loss[]
"
[56]

 Considering the clear violation of a COA regulation as stated in the 
2009 EME ND, and the disallowance of a previous similar transaction,
[57]
 the COA correctly observed that the transaction subject of the 
2009 EME ND
 was "already ripe for auditorial determination."
[58]



Correspondingly, under paragraph 10.1 of the RRSA, an ND shall issue, 
without the mention of an AOM, "for transactions which are 
irregular/unnecessary/excessive and extravagant as defined in COA 
Circular No. 85-55A
[59]
 as 
well as other COA issuances, and those which are illegal and 
unconscionable." In fact, paragraph 10.3 of the RRSA requires that 
"[t]he ND shall be issued as often as disallowances are made by the 
Auditor in order to notify the agency head, the accountant, and the 
persons liable for the amount disallowed in audit." Upon receipt of the 
ND, the affected officers and employees can appeal the ND to the COA 
CGS,
[60]
 then to the COA Proper,
[61]
 and even question it before this Court
[62]

 as PSALM did. Thus, despite non-issuance of an AOM, PSALM was afforded 
the right to be properly notified and fully heard. It cannot complain 
that due process requirements were disregarded. Well-settled is the rule
 that the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard; 
an opportunity to explain one's side; or the opportunity to seek a 
reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. It safeguards, 
not the lack of previous notice, but the denial of the opportunity to be
 heard. When the party was afforded the opportunity to defend his 
interests in due course, there is no denial of due process.
[63]



Verily, the COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in upholding the 
2009 EME ND
 despite non-issuance of an AOM.



II. Finality of COA Proper Decision No. 2013-229



It is undisputed that the COA Proper's Decision No. 2013-229 had already
 attained finality for PSALM's failure to file an MR or petition for 
certiorari
 in accordance with Sections 9 and 10, Rule X of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA,
[64]
 as amended by COA Resolution No. 2011-006,
[65]
 
viz
.:




  SEC. 9. Finality of Decisions or Resolutions. - A decision or 
resolution of the Commission upon any matter within its jurisdiction 
shall become final and executory after the lapse of thirty (30) days 
from notice of the decision or resolution. x x x



        x x x x
      


SEC. 10. Motion for Reconsideration. - A motion for reconsideration may 
be filed within thirty (30) days from notice of the decision or 
resolution, on the grounds that the evidence is insufficient to justify 
the decision; or that the said decision of the Commission is contrary to
 law. Only one (1) motion for reconsideration of a decision of the 
Commission shall be entertained.




Despite such admitted lapse on PSALM's part, it faults the COA Proper 
for denying its motion for relief from judgment and for maintaining the 
validity of the NFD. PSALM insists that it is entitled to relief on the 
grounds of honest mistake, inadvertence, or excusable negligence on the 
part of its staff, who claim to have "unknowingly"
[66]

 received two COA Proper decisions (Decision No. 2013-228 and Decision 
No. 2013-229) on the same day. Thinking that they received only one 
decision, they were able to file an MR only of Decision No. 2013-228. 
This argument fails to impress.


Relief from judgment is a remedy found under Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court.
[67]

 It is an equitable relief granted only under exceptional circumstances 
when a judgment or final order is rendered against a party, who was 
prevented from taking part in the proceedings or taking an appeal due to
 lack of available or adequate remedy, or on grounds of fraud, accident,
 mistake, or excusable negligence.
[68]

 "Mistake" as a ground for relief from judgment should be of such nature
 as to cause substantial injustice, or so palpable that it borders on 
extrinsic fraud. There is extrinsic fraud when a party is prevented from
 fully and fairly presenting his case to the Court.
[69]

 On the other hand, "negligence" or inadvertence to be excusable, must 
be one which ordinary diligence and prudence could not have guarded 
against.
[70]



In this case, PSALM had the remedies of filing an MR and a petition for 
certiorari
,
 but failed to do so due to its own fault. The alleged mistake and 
inadvertence or negligence of PSALM's staff in failing to avail of its 
legal remedies do not fall under the contemplation of the rules to 
warrant relief from a final and immutable judgment. There is no showing 
that PSALM was deprived of the opportunity to present its case fully and
 fairly as it had several occasions to justify its 2008 EME 
reimbursements. Notably, it repeatedly raised the same arguments, which 
were fully addressed by the COA Auditor, COA CGS, as well as the COA 
Proper. There is also no showing that the alleged mistake or negligence 
could not have been prevented through ordinary diligence and prudence. 
PSALM knew that it had pending cases with the COA, and as a litigant, it
 has the duty to be vigilant with the status of its pending cases.
[71]

 Relief cannot be granted on a flimsy excuse that the failure to file 
the necessary pleading was due to some mistake, inadvertence, or 
negligence of the party's staff, who got confused upon receipt of two 
COA decisions when they were, in fact, awaiting two decisions from the 
COA. Otherwise, all that a defeated party would do to salvage his or her
 case is to claim such simple mistake, inadvertence, or neglect as 
grounds for the review of every adverse judgment, which will put no end 
to litigation.
[72]



Time and again, we have held that a party to an original action who 
fails to question an adverse judgment by not filing the proper remedy 
within the period prescribed by law loses the right to do so, and the 
judgment or decision as to him or her becomes final and binding.
[73]

 The decision becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be 
modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct 
erroneous conclusions of fact and law.
[74]

 This doctrine of immutability is grounded upon the fundamental 
principles of public policy and sound practice that, at the risk of 
occasional error, the judgment of courts and quasi-judicial agencies 
must become final at some definite date fixed by law.
[75]



By and large, we find that the COA did not commit grave abuse of 
discretion in denying the motion for relief from judgment and sustaining
 the finality and immutability of its Decision No. 2013-229. 
Significantly, it would not go amiss to emphasize that PSALM's failure 
to file an MR or a petition for 
certiorari
 was not a denial of 
due process as it was able to fully ventilate its case before the COA 
Auditor, the COA CGS, and the COA Proper. Be that as it may, in the 
proceeding discussions, we shall address the common substantive issues 
raised to challenge Decision No. 2013-229 on the propriety of the 
2008 EME ND
 and Decision No. 2013-228 with regard to the 
2009 EME ND
.



III. Propriety of the 
2008 EME ND
 and 
2009 EME ND








A. COA Circular No. 2006-001 applies to PSALM


 







Pertinent portions of COA Circular No. 2006-001 provide:





I. RATIONALE


Governing boards of government-owned and controlled 
corporations/government financial institutions (GOCCs/GFIs) are 
invariably empowered to appropriate through resolutions such amounts as 
they deem appropriate for [EME]. 
Previous circulars issued by this 
Commission pursuant to its constitutional mandate to promulgate 
accounting and auditing rules and regulations governing such expenses, 
however, clearly and categorically pertain to [NGAs] only. There is a 
need, therefore, to prescribe rules and regulations specifically for 
government corporations to regulate the incurrence of these expenditures
 and ensure the prevention or disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, 
excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or uses of 
government funds.



II. SCOPE AND COVERAGE



This Circular shall be applicable to all GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries.

 It shall cover [EME] and other similar expenses, such as discretionary,
 business development expenses, representation expenses and the like, 
provided that the nature or purpose of said expenditures pertain to any 
of the following:
 


x x x x
  



The above enumeration is not exclusive and shall not prevent the 
inclusion of other similar disbursements which may be categorized as 
[EME] within its contemplation.
 


III. AUDIT GUIDELINES




 The amount of [EME], as authorized in the corporate charters of 
GOCCs/GFIs shall be the ceiling in the disbursement of these funds. 
Where
 no such authority is granted in the corporate charter and the authority
 to grant [EME] is derived from the General Appropriations Act (GAA), 
the amounts fixed thereunder shall be the ceiling in the 
disbursements[.]




x x x x (Emphases supplied.)



PSALM harps on the first sentence of COA Circular No. 2006-001's 
"Rationale" in arguing that the circular specifically applies only to 
GOCCs, which are invariably empowered to allocate through their 
governing boards such amounts as they deem appropriate for EME, and not 
to those which disburse EME in accordance with the amounts fixed under 
the GAA. It theorizes that the evil sought to be prevented by COA 
Circular No. 2006-001, 
i.e.
, the irregular, excessive, 
extravagant, or unconscionable expenditure of public funds through EME 
disbursements, was already addressed by compliance with the ceiling 
amounts fixed under the GAA. Since PSALM disburses EME in accordance 
with the GAA, it insists that Section 397(c) of the GAAM - Volume I, 
echoing Paragraph III(4) of COA Circular No. 89-300 dated March 21, 
1989, should instead be applied, thus:



SEC. 397. Guidelines for payment of extraordinary and 
miscellaneous expenses. - The officials concerned shall be guided by the
 following rules:



x x x x




c. The entitlement to the benefit shall be strictly non-commutable or 
reimbursement basis. The corresponding claim for reimbursement of such 
expenses shall be supported by receipts and/or other documents 
evidencing disbursement, if these are available, or, 
in lieu thereof,
 by a certification executed by the official concerned that the expenses
 sought to be reimbursed have been incurred for any of the purposes 
contemplated under the law or regulation in relation to
 incurred for
 an office specified in the law, such certification shall be executed 
solely by the head of the office. (COA Cir. 89-300, Mar. 21, 1989) 
(Emphasis supplied.)



We do not agree.


COA Circular No. 89-300, which was reproduced in Section 397(c) of the 
GAAM - Volume I, is a previous regulation, applicable only to NGAs, and 
not to GOCCs/GFIs.
[76]
 
Paragraph II of COA Circular No. 89-300, captioned as "Scope and 
Coverage" categorically indicates that it applies to "appropriations 
authorized under [the GAA of 1989] 
for National Government [A]gencies
 [that] may be used for incurrence of [EME] at the rates and by the offices and officials specified therein."
[77]
 On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2006-001 is a recent regulation, issued specifically 
to all GOCCs, GFIs and its subsidiaries

 without distinction, as can be inferred from the express statement 
under its Paragraph II, captioned as "Scope and Coverage." Too, 
Paragraph III(1) of COA Circular No. 2006-001 particularly mentions 
GOCCs that derive their authority to grant EME from the GAA to be 
covered by the "Audit Guidelines." The explicit language of COA Circular
 2006-001 is clear and needs no interpretation. It applies to PSALM and 
all other GOCCs without qualification. Hence, the COA correctly applied 
the legal maxim "
ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus
" or "where the law does not distinguish, neither should we."
[78]



Furthermore, that COA Circular No. 89-300 applies only to NGAs, while 
COA Circular No. 2006-001 governs GOCCs/GFIs is confirmed in the more 
recent COA Circular No. 2012-001
[79]
 dated June 14, 2012, which provides:





General Guidelines



    
The amount fixed under the GAA for National Government offices and 
officials shall be the ceiling in the disbursement of [EME]. It shall 
cover [EME] and other similar expenses, such as discretionary, business 
development expenses, representation expenses and the like. 
The audit
 guidelines on disbursement for these expenses in [NGAs] are prescribed 
under COA Circular No. 89-300 dated March 31, 1989.



      
For GOCCs/GFIs, the amount authorized in their corporate charters shall be the ceiling in the disbursement of funds. 
Where
 no such authority is granted in tbe corporate charter and the authority
 to grant [EME] is derived from the GAA, the amounts fixed thereunder 
shall be the ceiling in the disbursements. The guidelines for GOCCs/GFIs
 are prescribed under COA Circular No. 2006-001 dated January 3, 2006.

[80]
 (Emphases supplied.)




Also, in 
National Transmission Corporation v. Commission on Audit and Aguinaldo
,
[81]
 (
TransCo
) we consistently ruled that:



[While] it is undisputed that the authority of TransCo to
 allow the payment of EME is derived from the GAA[,] x x x it may do so 
only when the conditions set forth in COA Circular No. 2006-001 have 
been clearly established.
 In fact, the last paragraph of Section 28 
of the GAA explicitly states that "these expenditures shall be subject 
to pertinent accounting and auditing rules and regulations." (Emphasis 
supplied.)



Accordingly, whether a GOCC derives the authority to disburse EME from 
its charter or from the GAA, the rules laid down in COA Circular No. 
2006-001 shall govern.



More importantly, contrary to PSALM's stance, the evil sought to be 
prevented by the requirement under COA Circular No. 2006-001 is not 
extinguished simply by complying with the fixed amounts under the GAA in
 disbursing public funds for EME. Note that COA Circular No. 2006-001 
was issued to "ensure the prevention or disallowance of irregular, 
unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures or 
uses of government funds"
[82]
 
in GOCCs, GFIs and its subsidiaries. Certain COA issuances particularly 
described what those prevented transactions are. For instance, COA 
Circular No. 85-55A
[83]
 and COA Circular No. 2012-003
[84]

 both define "excessive expenditures" as those signifying unreasonable 
expenses incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price; and 
those which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which 
are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount.
[85]

 Indeed, a disbursement for EME may be well within the threshold amount 
under the GAA, but such amount may possibly correspond to an expense 
obtained at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price, which makes it 
an excessive expenditure. These factual considerations for auditing 
purposes can only be ascertained through receipts and similar documents,
 which reflect such essential transaction details needed for the 
determination of an expenditure's propriety.







B. The invoked certifications 
cannot be considered as substantial compliance with the documentary 
requirement under COA Circular No. 2006-001.


 







It is undisputed that PSALM's EME reimbursements were not supported by 
any receipt or similar documents. Only the certifications executed by 
the claimants in accordance with Section 397(c) of the GAAM - Volume I 
and COA Circular No. 89-300 were presented to justify the EME 
disbursements.



We underscore that COA Circular No. 2006-001 did not adopt the use of a 
certification contemplated under the GAAM or COA Circular No. 89-300 as 
an alternative supporting document for EME disbursement. The plain 
language of Paragraph III(3) of COA Circular No. 2006-001 mandates that 
"[t]he claim for reimbursement of such expenses shall be supported by 
receipts and/or other documents evidencing disbursements
."
[86]
 As we have held in 
Espinas v. Commission on Audit
[87]
 (
Espinas
):



[T]he Court concurs with the C[O]A's conclusion that the 
"certification" submitted by petitioners cannot be properly considered 
as a supporting document within the purview of Item III(3) of C[O]A 
Circular No. 2006-01 which pertinently states that a "claim for 
reimbursement of [EME] expenses shall be supported by receipts and/or 
other documents evidencing disbursements." Similar to the word 
"receipts," the "other documents" pertained to under the above-stated 
provision is qualified by the phrase "evidencing disbursements." Citing 
its lexicographic definition, the C[O]A stated that the term 
"disbursement" means "to pay out commonly from a fund" or "to make 
payment in settlement of debt or account payable." That said, it then 
logically follows that petitioners' "certification," so as to fall under
 the phrase "other documents" under Item III(3) of C[O]A Circular No. 
2006-01, must substantiate the "paying out of an account payable," or, 
in simple term, a disbursement. However, an examination of the sample 
"certification" attached to the petition does not, by any means, fit 
this description. 
The signatory therein merely certifies that he/she 
has spent, within a particular month, a certain amount for meetings, 
seminars, conferences, official entertainment, public relations, and the
 like, and that the certified amount is within the ceiling authorized 
under the LWUA corporate budget. Accordingly, since petitioners' 
reimbursement claims were solely supported by this "certification," the 
C[O]A properly disallowed said claims for failure to comply with C[O]A 
Circular No. 2006-01.
[88]
 (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)



We further elucidated in 
TransCo
, citing 
Espinas
, that:



[A] certification may or may not constitute an adequate proof of disbursement. 
To
 be admitted as a sufficient evidence of payment, the certification 
presented by the GOCC must establish "the paying out of an account 
payable," or a disbursement. It must reflect the transaction details 
that are typically found in a receipt which is the best evidence of the 
fact of payment. It must specify the nature and description of the 
expenditures, amount of the expenses, and the date and place they were 
incurred. This interpretation holds true even with just a plain reading 
of [Paragraph] III of COA Circular No. 2006-001, since the phrase "other
 documents" is qualified by the phrase evidencing disbursements.
 A 
sweeping and general statement that expenditures were incurred by some 
officials within a certain month does not, in any way, satisfy the 
condition contemplated in the circular. Unfortunately, in this case, the
 certifications submitted by TransCo officials merely provided a simple 
declaration from each payee that "the expenses have been incurred for 
any of the purposes contemplated under the law or regulation (GAA and 
COA Circular No. 89-300) in relation to or by reason of my position." 
Hence, the Court is not inclined to accept such certification as valid 
evidence of disbursement.
[89]
 (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)



We note that the certifications supporting the reimbursements of PSALM's
 officials were not attached to these Petitions. Hence, we are 
constrained to sustain the COA's factual findings with regard to the 
insufficiency of the transaction details stated in each certification. 
In any case, the averments in the Petitions would show that the invoked 
certifications stated similar sweeping and general allegations that the 
expenses sought to be reimbursed have been incurred by the claimant for 
any of the purposes contemplated under the law or regulation in relation
 to or by reason of his position.
[90]

 We stress that these allegations are insufficient evidence of 
disbursement under the COA auditing rules and regulations. Hence, 
PSALM's unjustified insistence to use such certifications as sufficient 
evidence of disbursements cannot be permitted.








C. The principle of equal 
protection was not violated when some GOCCs were allegedly allowed to 
use certifications as supporting documents for EME reimbursements. 
Neither does the difference in treatment between NGAs and GOCCs violate 
such principle.


 








The equal protection clause under the Constitution
[91]

 basically requires that all persons be treated alike under like 
circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and 
liabilities enforced.
[92]
 "The purpose of the equal protection clause is to secure every person within a [S]tate's jurisdiction 
against intentional and arbitrary discrimination
,
 whether occasioned by the express terms of a statute or by its improper
 execution through the state's duly constituted authorities."
[93]





PSALM claims that there was a violation of the equal protection clause 
when GOCCs, such as the NPC and TransCo, were allegedly still permitted 
to use certifications as proof of EME disbursements to claim 
reimbursements. We are not persuaded.




For one, PSALM did not adduce evidence to support the truth and veracity of this allegation. On the contrary, in 
National Power Corporation v. Commission on Audit
,
[94]
 NPC's EME disbursements, supported merely by certifications, were disallowed by the COA. In the case of 
TransCo

 cited above, the 2010 EME reimbursed to its officials was similarly 
disallowed for being supported only by certifications. In both cases, 
the COA sustained the necessity of receipts in the reimbursements of 
EME. At any rate, unless there is a showing of an intentional or 
arbitrary discrimination, the Auditor's alleged failure to enforce COA 
Circular No. 2006-001 upon certain GOCCs would not prove a violation of 
the equal protection clause.
[95]

 As aptly held by the COA, such omission on the part of the State's 
agent, if at all, is of no controlling significance to the valid 
implementation of the circular to all GOCCs because the State cannot be 
estopped by the omission, mistake or error of its officials or agents;
[96]

 it cannot be barred from correcting a public officer's mistake or 
erroneous application of a law. Besides, an unlawful and irregular act 
cannot be legitimized by mere continuous practice, nor can it give rise 
to a vested right.
[97]




PSALM also argues that the difference in the auditing rules applied to 
NGAs on one hand, and to GOCCs on the other, is a violation of the 
principle of equal protection. This argument was not raised before the 
COA,
[98]
 but is nonetheless not a novel one. We defer to the iteration of this issue in 
Espinas
, wherein we held that:



[T]here exists a 
substantial distinction
 between 
officials of NGAs and the officials of GOCCs, GFIs and their 
subsidiaries which justify the peculiarity in regulation. Since the 
EME
 of GOCCs, GFIs and their subsidiaries, are, pursuant to law, allocated 
by their own internal governing boards, as opposed to the EME of NGAs 
which are appropriated in the annual GAA duly enacted by Congress, there
 is a perceivable rational impetus for the C[O]A to impose nuanced 
control measures to check if the EME disbursements of GOCCs, GFIs and 
their subsidiaries constitute irregular, unnecessary, excessive, 
extravagant, or unconscionable government expenditures
. x x x 
Indeed, the Court recognizes that denying GOCCs, GFIs and their 
subsidiaries the benefit of submitting a secondary-alternate document in
 support of an EME reimbursement, such as the "certification" discussed 
herein, is a C[O]A policy intended to address the disparity in EME 
disbursement autonomy.
[99]
 x x x (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)



Indeed, the guaranty of equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty 
of similarity in the application of the laws upon all persons. The 
Constitution does not require that things which are different in fact be
 treated in law as though they were the same.
[100]
 The principle recognizes a valid classification,
[101]
 that is, a classification that has a reasonable foundation or rational basis and not arbitrary.
[102]

 Here, the COA rules and regulations with regard to EME disbursements 
appear to be more lenient with NGAs as it allows the use of 
certifications in accordance with COA Circular No. 89-300, while COA 
Circular No. 2006-001 strictly requires receipts and similar documents 
for GOCCs. The difference in treatment lies in the statutory limitations
 against NGAs in disbursing EME. Aside from the ceiling amounts, the EME
 appropriations of NGAs are limited to those approved by the Congress in
 the enactment of the annual GAA. Such appropriations, being fixed in a 
statute, enjoy the presumption of validity. The presumption is that the 
legislature intended to enact a valid, sensible, and just law, and one 
which operates no further than may be necessary to effectuate the 
specific purpose of the law.
[103]

 On the other hand, the EME of GOCCs, even of those whose authority to 
disburse EME is derived from the GAA, are appropriated by their own 
governing boards as they see fit, subject to the ceiling amount provided
 under the GAA. They have more latitude of discretion in such 
expenditure compared to NGAs, whose EME appropriations are fixed in the 
GAA. Thus, as explained in 
Espinas
, the difference in treatment is a "
C[O]A policy intended to address the disparity in EME disbursement autonomy
"
[104]

 of the NGAs and GOCCs. "Hence, in due deference to the C[O]A's 
constitutional prerogatives, the Court, absent any semblance of grave 
abuse of discretion in this case, respects the regulation x x x."
[105]








D. All approving and/or 
certifying officers of the disallowed 2008 and 2009 EME are solidarily 
liable to settle the disallowed amounts; and all recipients are liable 
to refund the amounts that they individually received.


 







PSALM invokes good faith on the part of its officers and employees, who 
approved/certified and received the 2008 and 2009 EMEs. We reiterate 
that the COA Proper's ruling on the 2008 EME in Decision No. 2013-229 
had already attained finality. Hence, any discussion on the alleged good
 faith of those affected by that immutable decision is immaterial. We 
stress, in both Decision No. 2013-229 and Decision No. 2013-228, that 
the COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in holding all the 
approving and certifying officers, as well as the individual recipients,
 liable to settle the disallowed amounts.


In the recent case of 
Madera v. Commission on Audit
[106]
 (
Madera
),
 we explained that, upon a showing of bad faith, malice, or gross 
negligence in the performance of their official duties, the approving 
and certifying officers of the disallowed transactions are solidarily 
liable.
[107]
 Good faith has been defined in disallowance cases as:



"that state of mind denoting honesty of intention, and 
freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry
;
 an honest intention to abstain from taking any unconscientious 
advantage of another, even though technicalities of law, together with 
absence of all information, notice, or benefit or belief of facts which render transactions unconscientious
."
[108]
 (Emphasis supplied.)



The determination of good faith or bad faith is, however, not dependent 
upon cast-iron rules. Rather, the unique facts obtaining in every case 
should be judiciously evaluated. In this case, recall that PSALM was 
served with a copy of COA Circular No. 2006-001 back in 2006.
[109]
 In 2008, PSALM was again specifically reminded of the rules on EME disbursements under COA Circular No. 2006-001.
[110]

 Still, PSALM conveniently opted to reimburse EME claims in accordance 
with the lenient requirement under COA Circular No. 89-300, instead of 
simply complying with the categorical provisions of COA Circular No. 
2006-001 and the straightforward reminder of the COA Auditor that 
certifications are no longer allowed under the prevailing rules. In 
other words, PSALM cannot feign ignorance of the applicable rules nor 
can it raise obscurity in its provisions. This case does not involve a 
mere honest lapse of judgment in relying upon COA Circular No. 89-300 or
 a mistaken interpretation of the provisions of COA Circular No. 
2006-001, but a wanton defiance of the applicable rules and the 
categorical directives of the COA. Certainly, such defiance betrays the 
genuineness of PSALM's invocation of good faith.
[111]

 Hence, the COA did not err in holding the approving and certifying 
officers liable to refund, whether they were recipients of the 
disallowed amounts or not.
[112]




As for the recipients, we clarified in 
Madera
 that the existence 
of good faith on their part is immaterial in the determination of their 
liability in a disallowed transaction because their liability is based 
on the principles of 
solutio indebiti
[113]
 and unjust enrichment.
[114]

 Recipients may only be absolved from the liability to settle the 
disallowed transaction: (1) upon a showing that the disallowed amounts 
were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered; or (2) 
excused by the Court on the basis of undue prejudice, social justice 
considerations, and other 
bona fide
 exceptions depending on the purpose, nature, and amount of the disallowed transaction relative to the attending circumstances.
[115]

 Here, the absence of the required receipts or similar documents to 
substantiate the claims of reimbursement precisely denies us the basis 
to conclude that the disallowed amounts were genuinely used in 
consideration of or in connection with the recipients' services. Neither
 is there any 
bona fide
 equitable consideration relevant to the 
nature, purpose, and amount of the grant that would warrant the 
recipients' absolution from their civil obligation to the government 
Consequently, all the recipients are liable to return the amounts that 
they individually received.



FOR THESE REASONS
, both Petitions in G.R. No. 213425 and GR. No. 216606 are 
DISMISSED
.
 The Commission on Audit's Decision No. 2013-228 dated December 23, 2013

 as Resolution dated November 20, 2014 in COA CP Case No. 2010-362, are 
AFFIRMED
.
 The officers of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management 
Corporation, who approved and certified the disbursement of the 2008 and

refund the disallowed amounts, while all the recipients are liable to 
refund the amounts that they individually received.

 ART. IX-D, SEC. 2(1). The
 Commission on Audit shall have the power, authority, and duty to 
examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and 
receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or 
held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its 
subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned
 or controlled corporations with original charters, and on a post-audit 
basis: (a) constitutional bodies, commissions and offices that have been
 granted fiscal autonomy under this Constitution; (b) autonomous state 
colleges and universities; (c) other government-owned or controlled 
corporations and their subsidiaries; and (d) such non-governmental 
entities receiving subsidy or equity, directly or indirectly, from or 
through the Government, which are required by law or the granting 
institution to submit to such audit as a condition of subsidy or equity.
 However, where the internal control system of the audited agencies is 
inadequate, the Commission may adopt such measures, including temporary 
or special pre-audit, as are necessary and appropriate to correct the 
deficiencies. It shall keep the general accounts of the Government and, 
for such period as may be provided by law, preserve the vouchers and 
other supporting papers pertaining thereto.
                                      



(2). The Commission shall have exclusive authority, subject to the 
limitations in this Article, to define the scope of its audit and 
examination, establish the techniques and methods required therefor, and
 promulgate accounting and auditing rules and regulations, including 
those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, 
excessive, or unconscionable expenditures, or uses of government funds 
and properties.

 It would be absurd to hold the COA guilty of grave abuse of discretion on a matter not raised before it.

                                      
As a rule, "[p]oints of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought 
to the attention of the lower court, administrative agency or 
quasi-judicial body need not be considered by a reviewing court, as they
 cannot be raised for the first time at that late stage."

, 767 Phil. 51, 82 (2015), citing 
Jacot v. Dal

auditing rules pertains to the COA's quasi-legislative or rule-making 
power, not to its quasi-judicial power. Hence, such matter is generally 
not reviewable by 
certiorari
 in accordance with Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Revised Rules of Court; See

 "Substantial 
distinction" is a requirement for valid classification. As held in the 
landmark case on the subject of equal protection, 
People v. Cayat
 (68 Phil. 12, 18 [1939]):



It is an established principle of constitutional law that 
the guaranty of the equal protection of the laws is not violated by a 
legislation based on reasonable classification. And the classification, 
to be reasonable, (1) must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) must be
 germane to the purposes of the law; (3) must not be limited to existing
 conditions only; and (4) must apply equally to all members of the same 
class. (Citations omitted.)
