THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 229811, April 28, 2021 ]


OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, REPRESENTED BY THE HONORABLE CONCHITA CARPIO MORALES, IN HER CAPACITY AS THE OMBUDSMAN; OMB-TASK FORCE PDAF; AND OMB-PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND CORRUPTON PREVENTION OFFICE, PETITIONERS, VS. OSCAR GONZALES MALAPITAN, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




LEONEN, J.:


The condonation doctrine was abandoned on April 12, 2016, when 
Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals
[1]

 attained finality. Nonetheless, despite its abandonment, the 
condonation doctrine can still apply to pending administrative cases
[2]

 provided that the reelection is also before the abandonment. As for 
cases filed after April 12, 2016, the impleaded public official can no 
longer resort to the condonation doctrine.
[3]




This Court resolves a Petition for Review
[4]
 assailing the Decision
[5]
 and Resolution
[6]

 of the Court of Appeals, which nullified the Office of the Ombudsman 
Orders granting the amendment to implead Oscar Gonzales Malapitan 
(Malapitan), an elected public official, in an administrative complaint.



Malapitan was the Caloocan City First District Representative from 2004 
to 2007. He was reelected from 2007 to 2010 and again from 2010 to 2013.
 In 2013, he became the Caloocan City mayor, and was reelected in 2016.
[7]
 He is the incumbent mayor, having been reelected in 2019.
[8]



On February 16, 2015, the Office of the Ombudsman's Public Assistance 
and Corruption Prevention Office filed a criminal complaint for 
violation of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt 
Practices Act, against the following public officials:








(1)


 Esperanza I. Cabral, as the Department of Social Welfare and Development Secretary in 2009;






(2) 


Mateo G. MontaÃ±o, as the current DSWD Undersecretary for General Administration and Support Services Group (GASSG);






(3) 


Luwalhati F. Pablo, as the former Undersecretary for GASSG;






(4) 


Vilma B. Cabrera, as the present DSWD Assistant Secretary for Institutional Development Group;






(5) 


Pacita D. Sarino, as the current DSWD Director III of the Program Management Bureau;






(6)


 
Leonila M. Hayahay, as the former DSWD Chief Accountant; and






(7)


Oscar G. Malapitan, as the former Congressman of the 1
st
 District of Caloocan City in 2009 and the current Mayor of Caloocan City.
[9]
 (Emphasis in the original)






The criminal complaint arose from the allegedly anomalous use of 
Malapitan's Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) worth 
P8,000,000.00. Malapitan, then a district representative, and the other 
charged officials had approved the PDAF to fund the programs of Kalookan
 Assistance Council, Inc. in 2009.
[10]



The criminal complaint also contained an administrative charge for grave
 misconduct, gross neglect of duty, and conduct prejudicial to the best 
interest of service against Mateo G. Montafto, Pacita D. Sarino, and 
Vilma G. Cabrera, three of the charged officials. Malapitan was not 
impleaded in the administrative complaint.
[11]



On January 22, 2016, the Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office filed a Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint,
[12]
 asking that Malapitan be impleaded in the administrative complaint after he had been inadvertently left out as a respondent.
[13]
 On February 22, 2016,
[14]
 the Office of the Ombudsman's Task Force PDAF granted the motion.



Malapitan moved for reconsideration
[15]
 of this Order, but the Task Force PDAF denied his motion.
[16]
 This denial prompted Malapitan to file a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition
[17]
 before the Court of Appeals.



On August 31, 2016, the Court of Appeals granted
[18]
 the Petition. It revisited the history of the condonation doctrine in jurisprudence
[19]
 until it was abandoned in 
Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals
[20]
 on November 10, 2015.
[21]
 The Court of Appeals pointed out that such abandonment applied prospectively.
[22]
 It then ruled that since Malapitan's alleged misconduct was committed in 2009, the condonation doctrine applied to his case.
[23]



The Court of Appeals held that under the condonation doctrine, 
Malapitan's election as mayor right after his term as Caloocan 
representative was a form of condonation from the voting public:


Also relevant to stress is that the same act subject of the 
administrative complaint was contracted by Malapitan as the 
representative of the 1
st
 District of Caloocan City at the 
House of Representative[s]. However, when he was elected as the Mayor of
 the City of Caloocan in the 2013 elections, whatever wrongful act or 
misconduct, if any, committed by him during his previous term as 
Congressman that might give rise to an administrative liability, was 
impliedly remitted and disregarded by the electoral process following 
the condonation doctrine set forth in our jurisprudence. For this reason
 alone, We find no justification to sustain the continuation of the 
administrative proceedings against Malapitan as he could no longer be 
held administratively liable for the act upon which he was 
administratively charged. The administrative case serves no other 
purpose than to expose him unnecessarily to the rigors of a full-blown 
investigation and hearing when, in the end, he would not be held 
accountable for a misconduct he committed during his prior term of 
public office. Indeed, it is an exercise in futility to still implead 
him in the administrative complaint.
[24]


The Court of Appeals also chided the Office of the Ombudsman for its 
"flimsy excuse" of inadvertently failing to implead Malapitan in the 
administrative complaint.
[25]
 It declared that the belated amendment to implead Malapitan was clearly brought about by the 
Carpio Morales

 ruling, with the Office of the Ombudsman mistakenly believing that 
there was no longer any legal hindrance to include Malapitan.
[26]




The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads:


FOR THESE REASONS
, We 
GRANT
 the instant 
Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition
. The Orders dated 22 February 2016 and 18 March 2016 of the Task Force PDAF of the Office of the Ombudsman are 
NULLIFIED

 and the latter is enjoined from proceeding with the administrative case
 docketed as OMB-C-A-15-0042 as against Oscar G. Malapitan.



SO ORDERED.
[27]
 (Emphasis in the original)

In its January 31, 2017 Resolution,
[28]
 the Court of Appeals dismissed the Office of the Ombudsman's Motion for Reconsideration.



In this Petition for Review on Certiorari,
[29]

 petitioners Office of the Ombudsman, Task Force PDAF, and the Public 
Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office allege that the Court of 
Appeals encroached on the Office of the Ombudsman's administrative 
disciplinary authority when it nullified the Orders of Task Force PDAF. 
Petitioners further claim that the proper remedy was for respondent 
Malapitan to file a counter-affidavit before the Task Force PDAF and not
 the extraordinary remedies of certiorari and prohibition before the 
Court of Appeals.
[30]








 


Petitioners assert that respondent filed his Counter-Affidavit two 
months before he filed his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition 
before the Court of Appeals, thus mooting the latter. Furthermore, they 
point out that since respondent actively participated in the 
administrative proceedings before filing his Petition for Certiorari and
 Prohibition, he had already submitted himself to the Office of the 
Ombudsman's jurisdiction.
[31]




Petitioners likewise submit that since the Task Force PDAF's Orders were
 merely interlocutory, the Court of Appeals prematurely resolved the 
administrative case against respondent on the merits by relying on the 
condonation doctrine.
[32]
 
Nonetheless, petitioners posit that even if the Court of Appeals could 
rightfully rule on the merits of the administrative case, the 
condonation doctrine does not apply to respondent because it was 
abandoned in 
Carpio Morales
, and should no longer apply to cases still pending with the Office of the Ombudsman.
[33]




Petitioners further maintain that even if 
Carpio Morales
 did not 
abandon the condonation doctrine, it still would not apply to respondent
 because he committed the alleged act in 2009, when he was a 
representative, while the complaint was only filed when he was already a
 mayor, "a position different from the position he held at the time he 
committed the acts of complained of."
[34]



In his Comment,
[35]
 respondent cited cases
[36]

 where it was held that courts can review "the Office of the Ombudsman's
 exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers" when there is 
grave abuse of discretion.
[37]




Respondent then argues that he could not be impleaded "because his acts 
were considered condoned by the electorate upon his re-election."
[38]
 He maintains that the condonation doctrine's abandonment is applied prospectively.
[39]
 He also insists that petitioners only sought the amendment to implead him because they had mistakenly thought that 
Carpio Morales
, issued in November 2015, would now work against him in the administrative case originally filed in February 2015.
[40]




Respondent further argues that his Petition before the Court of Appeals 
was not rendered moot when he filed his Counter-Affidavit and Verified 
Position Paper.
[41]
 He said that he "reserved his right to question"
[42]
 his inclusion in the administrative case when he filed his Verified Position Paper 
Ad Cautelam
.
[43]




In addition, respondent argues that the administrative complaint has prescribed.
[44]

 Citing Section 20(5) of Republic Act No. 6770, or the Ombudsman Act of 
1989, respondent argues that the Office of the Ombudsman may not 
investigate any complaint filed more than one year after the act 
complained of had been committed. From this, he points out that the 
administrative charges have prescribed because the acts imputed to him 
were committed in 2009, while the complaint was filed only in 2016.
[45]




Respondent also cites Section 20(2), in relation to Section 21, of 
Republic Act No. 6770 and notes that when he committed the alleged acts 
in 2009, he was still a member of Congress, and thus, outside the Office
 of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.
[46]

 He then notes that the Commission on Audit has primary jurisdiction 
over him because the charges involve the use of his PDAF when he was 
still a district representative.
[47]



Finally, respondent says that petitioner's late filing of the 
administrative complaint violates his right to due process and to the 
speedy disposition of cases.
[48]



In their Reply,
[49]
 
petitioners counter that the filing of an amended complaint is allowed 
under Administrative Order No. 7 and the Rules of Court. In addition, 
they point out that respondent filed no responsive pleading when they 
moved to amend their complaint.
[50]



Petitioners also maintain that respondent's active participation in the proceedings and filing of several pleadings
[51]
 mooted his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition where he questioned the filing of the amended Complaint.
[52]



As for respondent's invocation of Section 21 of the Ombudsman Act, 
petitioners rebut that this is "not a permanent exception or exclusion";
[53]
 otherwise, "there would be no means to fully account for the official's administrative liability."
[54]
 Petitioners claim that illegal acts may only be discovered after a public official's term of office.
[55]



Further, petitioners interpret Section 20(5) of Republic Act No. 6770 
differently in that it "does not refer to the prescription of the 
offense but to the discretion granted to the Office of the Ombudsman on 
whether it would investigate a particular administrative offense."
[56]



Petitioners also say that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not 
apply because the Commission on Audit's investigation is different from 
the Office of the Ombudsman's investigation.
[57]




Finally, petitioners deny that respondent's rights to due process and to the speedy disposition of cases have been violated.
[58]
 He was allegedly given the chance to respond to the allegations against him.
[59]

 They add that respondent himself contributed to the delay he complains 
of "by his filing of motions for extension of time and other dilatory 
and prohibited pleadings before the Office of the Ombudsman and the 
[Court of Appeals]."
[60]




The issues for this Court's resolution are:



First, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the 
condonation doctrine is applicable to respondent Oscar Gonzales 
Malapitan;



Second, whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling on 
respondent's administrative liability, considering that the issue raised
 before it was whether the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its 
discretion in granting the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint; 
and



Finally, whether or not the Court of Appeals encroached on the powers of
 the Office of the Ombudsman when it enjoined the Office of the 
Ombudsman from proceeding with the administrative case against 
respondent Oscar Gonzales Malapitan.



The Petition is denied.



The Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the condonation 
doctrine applies to respondent Since the act constituting the 
administrative offense was allegedly committed in 2009, and he was 
reelected in 2010, the condonation doctrine would still apply.



There appears to be confusion as to when the abandonment of the condonation doctrine took effect 
Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals
[61]

 was rendered on November 10, 2015. After this, on January 22, 2016, the
 administrative complaint was amended to include respondent, as the 
condonation doctrine was supposedly no longer available to him.



This confusion has long been put to rest in 
Crebello v. Office of the Ombudsman
,
[62]
 where this Court declared the exact date of the abandonment:


The abandonment of the doctrine of condonation took effect 
on April 12, 2016, when the Supreme Court denied with finality the OMB's
 Motion for Reconsideration in 
Morales v. Court of Appeals
.
[63]
 (Citation omitted)


Here, the amended administrative complaint was admitted on February 22, 
2016; hence, the condonation doctrine was not yet abandoned. The alleged
 acts imputed to respondent were supposedly committed in 2009. He was 
reelected as member of the House of Representatives in 2010.
[64]

 This immediately succeeding victory is what the condonation doctrine 
looks at. That respondent was later reelected in 2013, 2016, and 2019 
would be irrelevant.



In 
Herrera v. Mago
,
[65]

 where the public official was reelected in May 2016, after the 
abandonment of the condonation doctrine had taken effect, this Court 
ruled that the doctrine could not be invoked. It explained:



Yet, in 
Crebello v. Ombudsman
, it was underscored 
that the prospective application of Carpio-Morales should be reckoned 
from April 12, 2016 because that was the date on which this Court had 
acted upon and denied with finality the motion for clarification/motion 
for partial reconsideration thereon.






Verily, we hold that petitioner can no longer avail of the condonation 
doctrine because although the complaint below was instituted on January 
9, 2015, he got reelected only on May 9, 2016, well within the 
prospective application of 
Carpio-Morales
.
[66]
 (Citation omitted)


Nonetheless, that is not the case here. Although the administrative 
complaint was filed against respondent after the 2010 elections, it 
would not change the fact that the alleged act was committed in 2009, 
and the electorate reelected him in 2010, the immediately succeeding 
election. In 
Salumbides, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman
:
[67]




Salalima v. Guingona, Jr. and Mayor Garcia v. Hon. Mojica
 reinforced the doctrine. The condonation rule was applied even if the administrative complaint was 
not
 filed before the reelection of the public official, and even if the 
alleged misconduct occurred four days before the elections
, respectively. 
Salalima

 did not distinguish as to the date of filing of the administrative 
complaint, as long as the alleged misconduct was committed during the 
prior term, the precise timing or period of which 
Garcia
 did not 
further distinguish, as long as the wrongdoing that gave rise to the 
public official's culpability was committed prior to the date of 
reelection.
[68]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)


This Court also takes the opportunity to clarify the effect of 
Carpio Morales
. In 
Crebello
,
 we upheld the Office of the Ombudsman's argument that since the 
abandonment became effective only on April 12, 2016, "it would no longer
 apply the defense of condonation starting on April 12, 2016 
except for open and pending administrative cases
."
[69]
 Thus, after 
Carpio Morales
 became final, the condonation doctrine's applicability now depends 
on the date of the filing of the complaint
, not the date of the commission of the offense.
[70]

 Had the case been filed against respondent on April 13, 2016, for 
instance, he could no longer rely on the condonation doctrine.



However, since the case was filed in January 2016, and was admitted in February 2016, 
it was already an open case by the time the condonation doctrine was abandoned
.



On the second and third issues, a review of the Petition filed before 
the Court of Appeals shows that respondent only raised the issue of 
whether the Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when 
it granted the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Complaint Generally, 
courts are limited to the issues raised by the parties before it. 
However, since respondent invoked the condonation doctrine, and we have 
ruled that he can invoke the doctrine, the Court of Appeals did not err 
in so ruling:



For this reason alone, We find no justification to sustain 
the continuation of the administrative proceedings against Malapitan as 
he could no longer be held administratively liable for the act upon 
which he was administratively charged. The administrative case serves no
 other purpose than to expose him unnecessarily to the rigors of a 
full-blown investigation and hearing when, in the end, he would not be 
held accountable for a misconduct he committed during his prior term of 
public office. Indeed, it is an exercise in futility to still implead 
him in the administrative complaint.
[71]


As to respondent's argument that there was a substantial period before 
the administrative complaint was filed against him, this Court has ruled
 that:



. . . well-entrenched is the rule that administrative 
offenses do not prescribe. Administrative offenses by their very nature 
pertain to the character of public officers and employees. In 
disciplining public officers and employees, the object sought is not the
 punishment of the officer or employee but the improvement of the public
 service and the preservation of the public's faith and confidence in 
our government.
[72]
 (Citations omitted)


At the time the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition was filed before the Court of Appeals,
[73]

 the condonation doctrine has been abandoned. Nevertheless, since 
respondent can invoke the condonation doctrine, the Court of Appeals did
 not encroach on the Office of the Ombudsman's powers when it enjoined 
the Office of the Ombudsman from proceeding with the administrative 
complaint against respondent.



Carpio Morales
, citing 
Garcia v. Mojica
,
[74]

 recognized the futility of continuing with an administrative complaint 
when, in the end, the erring official could be exculpated by the 
condonation doctrine:


[I]f it was established that the acts subject of the 
administrative complaint were indeed committed during Binay, Jr.'s prior
 term, then, following the condonation doctrine, he can no longer be 
administratively charged. In other words, with condonation having been 
invoked by Binay, Jr. as an exculpatory affirmative defense at the 
onset, the CA deemed it unnecessary to determine if the evidence of 
guilt against him was strong, at least for the purpose of issuing the 
subject injunctive writs.
[75]


For administrative cases filed after April 12, 2016, the date when the 
condonation doctrine was abandoned, the rule is that courts should 
refrain from interfering with investigations conducted by the Office of 
the Ombudsman, being an independent body authorized by no less than our 
Constitution
[76]
 and Republic Act No. 6770
[77]
 to handle complaints against public officials and civil servants.
[78]
 
Carpio Morales
 espoused:



However, despite the ostensible breach of the separation of 
powers principle, the Court is not oblivious to the policy 
considerations behind the first paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770, as 
well as other statutory provisions of similar import. Thus, pending 
deliberation on whether or not to adopt the same, the Court, under its 
sole prerogative and authority over all matters of procedure, deems it 
proper to declare as ineffective the prohibition against courts other 
than the Supreme Court from issuing provisional injunctive writs to 
enjoin investigations conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, until it
 is adopted as part of the rules of procedure through an administrative 
circular duly issued therefor.
[79]


For clarity, respondent is absolved only of administrative liability 
based on the condonation doctrine. This Court makes no pronouncement on 
the criminal complaint against him.
