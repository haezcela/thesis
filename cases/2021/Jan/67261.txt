FIRST DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 233861, January 12, 2021 ]


CITY OF ILOILO, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE PORTS AUTHORITY AND DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




ZALAMEDA, J.:


Before the Court is a petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated 22 November 2016 and Resolution
[3]
 dated 28 July 2017 in CA G.R. CV No. 102578. 

Antecedents




On 03 November 2005, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) received a Notice of Garnishment
[4]

 from petitioner City of Iloilo (petitioner), levying bank deposits of 
the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) on account of its realty and 
business ta)(es delinquencies, interest, charges and penalties in the 
amount of Php44,298,470.11, pursuant to this Court's judgment in G.R. 
Nos. 109791
[5]
 and 143214. 
[6]
 DBP thus notified PPA of the notice of garnishment.
[7]
 


PPA requested petitioner to recall the notice of garnishment,
[8]

 claiming that its liability for local and real property taxes subject 
of this Court's judgment in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214, including 
interests and surcharges, had already been paid.
[9]
 It also asked DBP to release its funds from garnishment.
[10]
 Both efforts to cancel the garnishment of its funds proved futile.


On 05 June 2009, PPA filed a complaint against petitioner and DBP for
 declaration of nullity of the notice of garnishment with prayer for 
temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction,
[11]
 docketed as Civil Case No. 09-121552, before Branch 33, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila.




DBP, in its Answer, acknowledged the local government unit's power to
 issue a notice of garnishment against bank deposits of delinquent 
taxpayers. It explained that it is has no authority to determine if PPA 
had already settled its tax obligations with petitioner, hence, it 
cannot release PPA's funds from garnishment.
[12]
 


Petitioner, for its part, argued that the complaint had no cause of 
action since PPA's status as a taxable entity had already been settled 
under G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214. It also alleged that PPA failed to 
comply with the condition precedent under Section 252 of the Local 
Government Code (LGC), specifically, to pay its tax liabilities under 
protest.
[13]


 The RTC denied the application for a writ of injunction on 23 July 2009.
[14]
 The PPA questioned the RTC resolution before the CA through a petition for 
certiorari
, which was denied. This Court affirmed the CA in G.R. No. 204908.


 On 19 September 2012, the RTC rendered a Decision
[15]

 dismissing PPA's complaint for lack of merit. It found that the notice 
of garnishment was not limited to the amounts subject of G.R. Nos. 
109791 and 143214 but also included other liabilities, particularly 
those pertaining to the Iloilo Port Complex. The RTC ruled that PPA 
could not invoke the ruling in 
Spouses Curata v. Philippine Ports Authority
[16]

 because the subject of that decision was expropriation, and it was 
issued in 2009, or four (4) years after petitioner's issuance of the 
notice of garnishment in 2005.




PPA thus appealed to the CA.
[17]

 Notably, only DBP filed an appellee's brief. Meanwhile, on 07 November 
2013, petitioner requested DBP to release Php67,686,923.90 additional 
funds from PPA's accounts, in view of the finality of this Court's 
judgment in G.R. No. 204908.
[18]
 


DBP, through its Balanga, Bataan branch, remitted to petitioner the 
deposits of PPA in the amount of Php3,892,372.99 on 26 November 2013.
[19]

 It remitted an additional Php554,959.72 on 18 December 2013, allegedly 
pertaining to the interests accruing on the previously garnished 
deposits of PPA.
[20]


 On 20 November 2014, petitiOner issued sixteen (16) notices of 
assessment to PPA for its real property tax liabilities for 2015.
[21]


Ruling of the CA


The CA granted the appeal and ruled in favor of PPA on 22 November 
2016. It declared the Notice of Garnishment dated 26 October 2005 void, 
and directed petitioner to return the amount of Php26,661 ,552.41 to 
PPA.
[22]
 


It held that PPA is a government instrumentality pursuant to the rulings in 
MIAA v. Court of Appeals
 (MIAA case),
[23]
 Republic v. ParaÃ±aque,
[24]
 
Philippine Fisheries Development Authority v. Court of Appeals
.
[25]
 As such, its real properties devoted for public use are exempt from real property tax.
[26]
 


Further, the CA noted that the issue of whether Iloilo Port Complex 
is a taxable property was already settled by a final and executory 
decision
[27]
 of Branch 34, RTC of Iloilo City dated 11 August 1992.
[28]

 As to the notice of garnishment, the CA found it invalid because PPA 
had already settled its liabilities under G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214. 
TheCA also noted that the City of Iloilo's failure to issue a notice of 
assessment prior to the distraint was in violation of Section 195 of the
 LGC
[29]
 Finally, it opined 
that petitioner should have sought execution of the judgment in G.R. 
Nos. 109791 and 143214 instead of pursuing civil remedies against PPA.
[30]


Hence, this petition for review. 


Issues
 


Petitioner raised the following grounds in support of its petition: 


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS HAS ERRED IN
 DENYING THE PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT THE APPELLATE COURT DID NOT ACQUIRE JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT 
MATTER THE QUESTION BEING THE VALIDITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNIT TO 
IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE LOCAL TAX COLLECTION THROUGH GARNISHMENT WHICH 
FALLS WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS 
(CTA);


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED AND COMMITTED 
GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION 
WHEN IT HELD THAT SECTION 196 OF RA 7160 DOES NOT FIND APPLICATION IN 
THE INSTANT CASE


Petitioner contends that the CA has no jurisdiction to review the judgment of the RTC. Citing 
CE Casecnan Water & Energy Co., Inc. v. Province of Nueva Ecija
,
[31]
 it claims that the CTA has jurisdiction to review the decision of the RTC since the same involves a local tax case.
[32]
 Likewise, the CA erroneously relied on the 
MIAA

 case because allegedly there is no categorical declaration therein that
 MIAA and PPA are similarly situated in terms of their tax-exempt 
status.
[33]




Ruling of the Court


The CA has jurisdiction to review the

RTC decision
 


Jurisdiction is defined as the power and authority of a court to 
hear, try, and decide a case. In order for the court or an adjudicative 
body to have authority to dispose of the case on the merits, it must 
acquire, among others, jurisdiction over the subject matter.
[34]
 Jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law.
[35]
 


The jurisdiction of the CTA on local tax cases is set forth in Section 7 (a) (3) of Republic Act No. 9282 (RA 9282), 
viz
.:


SEC. 7. Jurisdiction.-The CTA shall exercise:


 a. Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:


3. Decisions, orders or resolutions of the 
Regional Trial Courts in local tax cases originally decided or resolved 
by them in the exercise of their original or appellate jurisdiction.




Based on this provision, the CTA's appellate jurisdiction over RTC 
decisions, orders, or resolutions may only be invoked over a ruling in a
 local tax case.
[36]
 In other words, the action in the RTC must be in the nature of a tax case, or one which primarily involves a tax issue.
[37]

 On the other hand, the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the 
nature of the action pleaded based on the allegations in the complaint 
and the character of the relief sought.
[38]
 


In this case, PPA's complaint for declaration of nullity and damages 
with prayer for TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction assails 
petitioner's resort to garnishment in order to enforce the final and 
executory judgment of this Couti in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214, 
viz
:




FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION


 3.2 As intimated, defendant City sought to garnish plaintiff's funds
 with defendant DBP to satisfy plaintiff's alleged liability for taxes, 
interests, penalties and surcharges adjudged in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 
143214.


3.3 But 
plaintiff effected full payment of its assessed tax liabilities
 as follows: 


(i) realty taxes and penalties on the warehouse subject 
of G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214 in the total amount of Php1,259,916 for 
the period covering 1985 to 1996;

(i) business taxes and penalties subject of G.R. No. 109791 in the total
 amount of Php446,505.92 for the period of 1984 to 1986 and 1995-2005;

(ii) realty taxes and penalties on the edifices and buildings covered by G.R. No. 143214 in the aggregate sum of Php227,917.28. 


3.4 
That payment of the foregoing sums completely satisfied the 
tax liabilities adverted to is evidenced by official n ceipts issued by 
no less than defendant City
, thru its City Treasurer, which indicate the word "FULL" to describe the event of plaintiff's payment.


3.5 Notwithstanding such clear notation on the official receipts, 
defendant City illegally and want only issued a notice of garnishment to
 collect the very same tax liabilities subject of the mentioned Supreme 
Court cases.


 3.6. Worse the purposed liabilities ballooned exponentially to PHp44,298,471.37 without any specification.


3.7 Moreover, note that the notice of garnishment was issued in 
implementation of the final and executory decisions in G.R. Nos 109791 
and 143214. XXX 




xxx




3.9 
G.R. No. 109791 to recall, originated from an action for collection instituted by defendant City
.
 The liabilities adjudged thereto, as affirmed by the Honorable Supreme 
Court, is enforceable only by a writ of execution duly issued by the 
trial court. Instead of going thru the legal and procedural remedies in 
the execution of judgment, defendant City took upon itself to implement 
the judgment by unilaterally issuing the subject notice of garnishment. 
To aggravate its procedural lapse, defendant City itself served the 
notice of garnishment when it should have been served by the court 
sheriff as provided by the rules of court.


 3.10 The notice of garnishment therefore, is defective and irregular
 on two counts: (i) it is without basis as the liabilities alluded to 
therein have been fully paid; and (ii) it was issued 
in violation of the rule on execution of judgments, which defendant City should have followed
.
 Failing in this respect, the notice of garnishment should be nullified 
under Article 4 of the Civil Code which renders void ab initio acts done
 in violation of mandatory provision of the law.
[39]
 (Emphasis ours) 


It is apparent then that PPA is not objecting to the amount of its 
tax liability. On the contrary, it admitted that it is indeed liable for
 the real property and business taxes for the periods adjudged under 
G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214. Indeed, it even admits it had already paid 
its liability in full. The complaint was merely to question petitioner's
 resort to garnishment, claiming that it already paid its liabilities 
therein. Clearly, PPA's complaint was 
not anchored on a tax issue

 but on the propriety of the remedy adopted by the City of Iloilo to 
enforce the final judgment of this Court. As such, the subject RTC 
Decision could not be characterized as a local tax case over which the 
CTA could have properly assumed jurisdiction on appeal.




The existence of a final and executory judgment fixing PPA's local 
and real property tax liabilities distinguishes this case from 
CE Casecnan Water & Energy Co., Inc. v. Province of Nueva Ecija
.
[40]

 While the latter case stemmed from a supposed erroneous assessment of 
therein petitioner's real property tax liability, the instant 
controversy is premised on the erroneous execution of this Court's final
 and executory judgment in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214. 


As an incident of its exemption from

local taxation, its properties are

likewise exempt from the means to

collect such taxes
 


In the MIAA case,
[41]
 the 
Court also elucidated that properties of government instrumentalities 
are of public dominion and are thus outside the commerce of men. They 
are not subject to levy, encumbrance, or disposition through public or 
private sale since they are intended for public use. This is necessarily
 so because essential public services will stop if properties of public 
dominion are subject to encumbrances, foreclosures, and auction sale.
[42]
 


The Court, in 
Spouses Curata v. Philippine Ports Authority
,
[43]

 invalidated the lower court's action in subjecting PPA funds to 
execution pending appeal as payment for just compensation. Citing the 
ruling in 
MIAA
, this Court declared that PPA is a government instrumentality, whose properties may not be subjected to any form of execution, 
viz
: 


In 
Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego
, no 
less than the eminent Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee explained the 
rationale behind the doctrine that government funds and properties 
cannot be seized under a writ of execution, thus:


The universal rule that where the State gives its consent to
 be sued by private parties either by general or special law, it may 
limit claimant's action "only up to the completion of proceedings 
anterior to the stage of execution" and that the power of the Courts 
ends when the judgment is rendered, since government funds and 
properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to 
satisfy such judgments, is based on obvious considerations of public 
policy. Disbursements of public funds must be covered by the 
corresponding appropriation as required by law. 
The functions and 
public services rendered by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed 
or disrupted by the diversion of public funds from their legitimate and 
specific objects, as appropriated by law.


PPA's monies, facilities and assets are government properties. 
Ergo, they are exempt from execution whether by virtue of a final 
judgment or pending appeal.


 PPA is a government instrumentality charged with carrying out 
governmental functions through the management, supervision, control and 
regulation of major ports of the country. It is an attached agency of 
the Department of Transportation and Communication pursuant to PD 505.


 This Court's disquisition in Manila International Airport Authority 
v. Court of Appeals- ruling that MIAA is not a government-owned and/or 
controlled corporation (GOCC), but an instrumentality of the National 
Government and thus exempt from local taxation, and that its real 
properties are owned by the Republic of the Philippines -is instructive.
 Therein we found that MIAA is neither a stock or a non-stock 
corporation, for its capital is not divided into shares nor does it have
 members. Moreover, the airport lands and buildings it administers are 
owned by the Republic, which certainly takes them outside the commerce 
of man and makes MIAA a mere trustee thereof. These findings are 
squarely applicable to PPA, as it is similarly situated as MIAA. 
First
, PPA is likewise not a GOCC for not having shares of stocks or members.


Second
, the docks, piers and buildings it administers are likewise owned by the Republic and, thus, outside the commerce of man. 
Third
,
 PPA is a mere trustee of these properties. Hence, like MIAA, PPA is 
clearly a government instrumentality, an agency of the government vested
 with corporate powers to perform efficiently its governmental 
functions.


Therefore, an undeniable conclusion is that the funds of PPA 
partake of government funds, and such may not be garnished absent an 
allocation by its Board or by statutory grant.
 If the PPA funds 
cannot be garnished and its properties, being govemment properties, 
cannot be levied via a writ of execution pursuant to a final judgment, 
then the trial court likewise cannot grant discretionary execution 
pending appeal 
as it would run afoul of the established jurisprudence that government properties are exempt from execution
. What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. (Emphasis ours)


Considering these aforesaid court decisions, PPA's funds cannot be a subject of execution.


Nonetheless, petitioner cannot be faulted for relying on the Court's 
prior rulings when it sought to collect local taxes from PPA on its 
properties. We note and acknowledge that the 
MIAA
 case was 
promulgated in 2006, while the garnishment subject of the instant case 
was issued in 2005. Be that as it may, the Court affirms the CA's 
finding that the 2005 notice of garnishment issued by petitioner against
 PPA is invalid. 


The notice of garnishment is void

because it varies the money judgment

set forth in G.R. Nos. 109791 and

143214
 


Garnishment is a mode of satisfaction of a money judgment.
[44]

 In legal contemplation, it is a forced novation by the substitution of 
creditors: the judgment debtor, who is the original creditor of the 
garnishee is, through service of the writ of garnishment, substituted by
 the judgment creditor who thereby becomes creditor of the garnishee. 
Under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the garnishee is obliged to deliver
 "debts due to the judgment obligor and other credits"
[45]

 to the proper officer issuing the writ. Moreover, "the law exempts from
 liability the person having in his possession or under his control any 
credits or other personal property belonging to the defendant ... if 
such property be delivered or transferred ... to the clerk, sheriff, or 
other officer of the court in which the action is pending."
[46]
 


Given its purpose, a writ of garnishment must necessarily be 
consistent with the judgment it intends to satisfy. It must conform to 
that ordained or decreed in the dispositive part of the decision.
[47]

 Execution not in harmony with the judgment is bereft of validity. In 
this case, the notice of garnishment was issued to satisfy PPA's 
liability under this Court's final judgment in G.R. Nos 109791 and 
143214.


 In G.R. No. 109791, promulgated in 2003, PPA was held liable for: ( 
1) Php98,519.16, as real property tax on its warehouse, from the last 
quarter of 1984 up to December 1986; and (2) the amount of Php3,828.07, 
as business tax, for the lease of real estate from the last quarter of 
1984 up to 1988. The tax liability for business taxes was for the lease 
of its building to private corporations. Meanwhile, in deciding G.R. No.
 143214 a year later, this Court upheld the petitioner's assessment of 
real property tax on PPA's warehouse and buildings from 1985-1989 
totaling Php125,990.95.


 Considering the amount of PPA's tax liabilities in the aforesaid 
cases, it is at once apparent that the amount petitioner sought to 
collect under the notice of garnishment in 2005, specifically, 
Php44,298,470.11, was drastically in excess of the money judgments 
against PPA. For this reason, the notice of garnishment is void as it 
varies the amounts specified in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214.


 
PPA s liabilities under G.R. Nos.

109791 and 143214 were already

paid


 The irregularity in the notice of garnishment is further highlighted
 by the fact that PPA was able to establish that the money judgments, 
plus interests and surcharges, in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214 were 
already settled and paid.


As noted by the CA, and undisputed by petitioner, PPA paid 
Php1,259,916.95 for its real property tax liabilities from 1984 to 1986,
 inclusive of charges, interest and penalties, and Php663,381.92 for its
 business taxes liabilities from 1984 to 2005, pursuant to the decision 
in G.R. No. 109791. On the other hand, to satisfy the judgment in G.R. 
No. 143214, PPA paid Php227,917.28.
[48]
 


Considering that petitioner already collected on the money judgments 
under G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214, there is no basis for the garnishment
 of Php 44,298,470.11. 


Garnishment for supposed tax

liabilities other than those covered by

G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214 is void

for lack of prior assessment
 To justify the obvious disparity of the
 money judgments in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214, petitioner harps on 
PPA's supposed tax delinquencies on its eighteen (18) other properties 
in Loboc, Lapaz and Veteran's Village in Iloilo City
[49]
.


 Petitioner cannot combine all of PPA's supposed tax liabilities and 
seek control of all its funds in various banks without undergoing the 
proper process of assessment. Notably, the notice of garnishment dated 
26 October 2005 did not cite any other liability other than those 
pertaining to PPA's judgment debt on its tax liabilities, 
viz
: 


GARNISHMENT


 You are hereby notified by these presents that by virtue of the 
Realty and business delinquencies, interests, surcharges and penalties 
of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) and/or Iloilo Commercial Port 
Complex, levy is hereby made upon all kinds of bank deposits in your 
possession or under your control 
pursuant to the Supreme Court 
decision which has become final and executory declaring PPA liable for 
such delinquencies, interest, surcharges and penalties in the case of 
PPA v. Iloilo City docketed as GR nos. 109791 and 143214 copies of which
 are hereto attached for your reference
, sufficient to cover the sum
 of Forty Four Million Two hundred Ninety Eight Thousand Four Hundred 
Seventy Pesos and 11/100 (P44,298,470.11) excluding other lawful fees 
and incidental expenses on this garnishment proceedings.

xxx (Emphasis ours) 


Thus, the RTC's pronouncement that PPA was duly notified of the 
assessment on its "other" liabilities "because it was indicated in the 
first sentence of the Notice of Garnishment" is incorrect.


 The procedure for enforcing local tax liability against a delinquent
 taxpayer's personal properties is set forth in Secs. 175 and 195 of the
 LGC, to wit: 


Section 175. 
Distraint of Personal Property
. - The remedy by distraint shall proceed as follows:

(a) Seizure - 
Upon failure of the person owing any local tax, fee, or
 charge to pay the same at the time required, the local treasurer or his
 deputy may, upon written notice
, seize or confiscate any personal 
property belonging to that person or any personal property subject to 
the lien in sufficient quantity to satisfy the tax, fee, or charge in 
question, together with any increment thereto incident to delinquency 
and the expenses of seizure. In such case, the local treasurer or his 
deputy shall issue a 
duly authenticated certificate
 based upon 
the records of his office showing the fact of delinquency and the 
amounts of the tax, fee, or charge and penalty due. Such certificate 
shall serve as sufficient warrant for the distraint of personal property
 aforementioned, subject to the taxpayer's right to claim exemption 
under the provisions of existing laws. Distrained personal property 
shall be sold at public auction in the manner hereon provided for.


Section 195. 
Protest of Assessment
. - When the local treasurer
 or his duly authorized representative finds that correct taxes, fees, 
or charges have not been paid, he shall issue 
a notice of assessment 
stating the nature of the tax, fee, or charge, the amount of deficiency,
 the surcharges, interests and penalties
. Within sixty (60) days 
from the receipt of the notice of assessment, the taxpayer may file a 
written protest with the local treasurer contesting the assessment; 
otherwise, the assessment shall become final and executory. The local 
treasurer shall decide the protest within sixty (60) days from the time 
of its filing. If the local treasurer finds the protest to be wholly or 
partly meritorious, he shall issue a notice cancelling wholly or 
partially the assessment. However, if the local treasurer finds the 
assessment to be wholly or partly correct, he shall deny the protest 
wholly or partly with notice to the taxpayer. The taxpayer shall have 
thirty (30) days from the receipt of the denial of the protest or from 
the lapse of the sixty (60) day period prescribed herein within which to
 appeal with the court of competent jurisdiction otherwise the 
assessment becomes conclusive and unappealable. (Emphasis ours) 


A similar provision for the process of collecting real property tax is found in Sec. 254 of the LGC, to wit:


Section 254. 
Notice of Delinquency in the Payment of the Real Property Tax
. -(a) 
When the real property tax or any other tax imposed under this Title becomes delinquent
,
 the provincial, city or municipal treasurer shall immediately cause a 
notice of the delinquency to be posted at the main hall and in a 
publicly accessible and conspicuous place in each barangay of the local 
government unit concerned . The notice ofdelinquency shall also be 
published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the province, city, or municipality.


 (b) Such 
notice shall specify the date upon which the tax became 
delinquent and shall state that personal property may be distrained to 
effect payment
. It shall likewise state that any time before the 
distraint of personal properiy, payment of the tax with surcharges, 
interests and penalties may be made in accordance with the next 
following Section, and unless the tax, surcharges and penalties are paid
 before the expiration of the year for which the tax is due except when 
the notice of assessment or special levy is contested administratively 
or judicially pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 3, Title II, Book II
 of this Code, the delinquent real property will be sold at public 
auction, and the title to the property will be vested in the purchaser, 
subject, however, to the right of the delinquent owner of the property 
or any person having legal interest therein to redeem the property 
within one (1) year from the date of sale. 


Collection of unpaid local and real property taxes requires that the 
taxpayer be first notified of the basis for his liability. While the law
 does not require citing the provision of the ordinance involved, the 
notice must state the nature of the tax, fee, or charge, the amount of 
deficiency, surcharges, interests and penalties.
[50]

 Notifying the delinquent taxpayer before the availment of both summary 
processes is also a settled principle in the collection of internal 
revenue taxes.
[51]
 The Bureau 
of Internal Revenue (BIR) is mandated to furnish the taxpayer with the 
preliminary assessment notice (PAN) in order to allow him or her to 
dispute the assessment, before it can resort to distraint/levy of the 
taxpayer's property. Failure of the BIR to comply with the notice 
invalidates the assessment.

At the core of these requirements for a valid notice of assessment is
 due process. While the lifeblood doctrine gives the State the right to 
collect taxes in the most expeditious way, it is not a license to 
disregard the constitutional guarantee that no person shall be deprived 
of his/her property without due process of law. The rule is that taxes 
must be collected reasonably and in accordance with the prescribed 
procedure.
[53]


 In balancing the scales between the power of the State to tax and 
its inherent right to prosecute perceived transgressors of the law on 
one side, and the constitutional rights of a citizen to due process of 
law and the equal protection of the laws on the other, the scales must 
tilt in favor of the individual, for a citizen's right is amply 
protected by the Bill of Rights under the Constitution.

 Here, petitioner's recourse to collect on PPA's other pending tax 
liabilities, if there be any, is to notify the latter of the facts and 
legal basis of the same. Petitioner cannot simply lump these liabilities
 with PPA's tax obligations, which have already been vetted and 
judicially confirmed. By garnishing funds beyond the amounts specified 
in G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214, petitioner circumvented the established 
rule, violating PPA's right to due process. Truly, PPA was deprived of 
effectively protesting the supposed assessment because the notice of 
garnishment did not contain information on the basis of the taxes.




Hence, it was only proper that petitioner return the amounts released
 to it in excess of PPA's liabilities in the aforesaid cases. As found 
by theCA, and again undisputed by petitioner, a total amount of 
Php26,661 ,552.41 of PPA's funds were released to petitioner despite its
 prior payment of its liabilities under G.R. Nos. 109791 and 143214. 
This amount should be returned to PPA's account in the DBP.
