CARANDANG, J.:


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse the Resolution
[2]
 dated February 22, 2019 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated October 14, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 1 55974 dismissing the petition for 
certiorari
[4]
 filed by petitioners. The petition for 
certiorari
 assailed the Decision
[5]
 dated May 10, 2016 and Order
[6]

 dated February 19, 2018 of the Office of the Ombudsman in 
OMB-L-A-15-0268 finding the petitioners administratively liable for 
Grave Misconduct for falsifying Barangay Resolution No. 10, series of 
2014 (Resolution No. 10) of Barangay Suyo (30-A), Laoag City and 
ordering their dismissal from public service with accessory penalties.
[7]


Antecedents


Petitioners Dominic Melecio M. Toledo (Toledo), Wilfredo J. Agcaoili 
(Agcaoili), Ferdinand H. Munsayac (Munsayac), Teddy J. Sebastian 
(Sebastian), Jefferson R. Palting (Palting), Marie Tess B. Gaspar 
(Gaspar), James S. Galang (Galang), and Christian J. Adina (Adina) were 
officers of Barangay Suyo (30-A), Laoag City, along with private 
respondent Arnold B. Bareng (Bareng). Toledo was the Barangay Chairman 
while Agcaoili, Munsayac, Sebastian, Palting, Gaspar, Galang and Bareng 
were Barangay Councilors. Marinell R. Galang (Marinell) was the Barangay
 Treasurer and Adina was the appointed Barangay Secretary. Meanwhile, 
private respondent Cesario D. Gabriel (Gabriel) is a resident of their 
barangay and was the competitor of Toledo for the barangay chairmanship.
[8]


Gabriel filed administrative complaints for grave misconduct against 
petitioners before the Office of the Ombudsman in relation to the 
alleged misappropriation of funds committed by petitioners. Gabriel 
averred that petitioners failed to explain the unauthorized or illegal 
use of the quarry fees and fees for fishing gadgets thus, he instituted 
the complaints for violation of Republic Act No. (R.A.) 3019 (Anti-Graft
 and Corrupt Practices Act) and for grave misconduct, docketed as 
OMB-L-A-14-0290 and OMB-L-A-14-0703, respectively. Petitioners offered 
in evidence in OMB-L-A-14-0703 Resolution No. 10, which according to 
Gabriel and Bareng is a falsified public document. However, these 
complaints are separate and independent from the case at hand.
[9]


On the basis of Resolution No. 10, private respondents Gabriel and 
Bareng instituted another complaint for grave misconduct before the 
Office of the Ombudsman against the petitioners docketed as 
OMB-L-A-15-0268, which complaint is the subject matter of this case. 
They alleged that Resolution No. 1 Oentitled 
"A Resolution Revoking 
Chapter IV. Service Fees Article A. Section 21. Imposition of Fee of 
Quarry Operators Amounting P50.00/Truck Load and Chapter V. Barangay 
Charges Article A. Rental Fee Under Sec. 26. Imposition of Fee of 
Fishing Gadgets of Barangay Ordinance No. 01 entitled Revenue Code of 
Barangay 30-A"
 was falsified. Bareng avers that Resolution No. 10 is
 fake since no such resolution was passed during the session of the 
barangay council held on November 16, 2014. According to Bareng, the 
signature beside his name as appearing in the minutes of the session was
 not his. Further, the main topic during the session was the accretion 
of a land in their barangay. They discussed whether the claimants have 
proof of ownership over the accretion and that the barangay needs to 
validate their proof of ownership.
[10]


Consequently, a criminal complaint
[11]

 for falsification and perjury was filed against petitioners by Gabriel 
before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Laoag City, which was 
dismissed for lack of probable cause.
[12]

 The prosecutor therein ruled that the complainant failed to adduce 
sufficient evidence to support the complaint for falsification of a 
public document and perjury, thus the complaint must be dismissed.
[13]

 Respondent Gabriel filed another criminal complaint for falsification 
of public document against petitioners before the Office of the 
Ombudsman and the Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officer of the 
Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon found probable cause. The 
pertinent criminal case, which is related to this administrative case 
under review, was raffled to Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Laoag City, 
Branch 16, docketed as Criminal Case No. 17756-16.
[14]


Petitioners argue that in the conduct of the proceedings for 
falsification of public document in Criminal Case No. 17756-16, Bareng 
admitted that the revocation on the collection of quarry fees was 
deliberated and approved during the barangay council sessions held on 
October 5, 2014 and November 16, 2014. The minutes of the October 5, 
2014 session would show that Bareng even participated in the discussion.
[15]


Ruling of the Office of the Ombudsman


On May 10, 2016, the Ombudsman found petitioners Toledo, Agcaoili, 
Munsayac, Sebastian, Palting, Gaspar, Galang, and Adina guilty of grave 
misconduct and ordered their dismissal from the service with accessory 
penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement 
benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar 
from taking civil service examination. Meanwhile, Marinell Galang was 
acquitted.
[16]


The Ombudsman held that petitioners falsified Resolution No. 10 by 
making it appear that the barangay council enacted and approved the said
 resolution. In addition, it gave credence to the sworn statement of 
Bareng that he was present during the barangay council's session held on
 November 16, 2014 and there was no mention at all about the passage and
 approval of Resolution No. 10.
[17]


The Ombudsman noted that the minutes of November 16, 2014 session 
discussed the accretion and the barangay officials agreed to invite 
those who conducted the survey and to require claimants to present their
 evidence of ownership. There was no mention about the revocation of 
Section 21 and Section 26 of the Suyo Revenue Code nor was there a 
discussion on the passage of Resolution No. 10.
[18]


Aggrieved, petitioners filed a Motion for 
Reinvestigation/Reconsideration arguing that there was no deliberate 
intent on their part to violate the law. The passage of the resolution 
was done to address the public clamor on the imposition of quarry fees 
and fees on fishing gadgets.
[19]


To prove that Resolution No. 10 was deliberated upon, petitioners attached the minutes of their sessions on September 21, 2014,
[20]
 October 5, 2014
[21]
 and November 16, 2014.
[22]

 It was during their October 5, 2014 session that the council made 
mention of the quarry fee collection and the need to pass an ordinance 
or resolution to revoke Section 21 (Imposing Quarry Fees) of the Suyo 
Revenue Code.
[23]


Petitioners submitted a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration
[24]
attaching a copy of the Transcript of Stenographic Notes (TSN)
[25]

 of the testimony of Bareng in Criminal Case No. 17756-16 before the RTC
 of Laoag City, Branch 16. In open court, Bareng admitted that he was 
present during the September 21, October 5, and November 16 sessions and
 that the revocation of Sec. 21 on quarry fee collection was mentioned 
during one of these sessions.
[26]

 Lastly, petitioners argue that the barangay has no authority to impose 
quarry fees and fees on fishing gadgets as the power resides with the 
provincial government under the Local Government Code.
[27]


On February 19, 2018, the Ombudsman denied the Motion finding no error in its Decision.
[28]


Petitioners filed their petition for 
certiorari
[29]
 under Rule 65 before CA.


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


On February 22, 2019 the CA dismissed the petition for 
certiorari
 since the petitioners availed of the wrong remedy.
[30]

 The proper mode of appealing decisions of the Ombudsman in 
administrative cases is a petition for review under Rule 43 of the 
Revised Rules of Court.
[31]


The CA noted that petitioners failed to pay the full docket and other 
lawful fees. Further, petitioners did not attach to their petition 
certified true copies of relevant documents.
[32]


Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[33]

 begging the CA for liberal application of the procedural rules and to 
consider their petition filed under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.
[34]

 They attached a check for the deficiency in the docket fees paid 
pleading honest mistake, not knowing that the docket fees have already 
been increased. They also attached certified true copies of the relevant
 documents listed by the CA.
[35]


On the merits, petitioners argue that there was no ground to hold them 
liable for grave misconduct because they did not falsify Resolution No. 
10. To support their claim, petitioners attached the Order dated August 
24, 2018 of the RTC in Criminal Case No. 17756-16 granting their 
Demurrer to Evidence and dismissing the case against them. In the Order,
 the RTC ruled that Resolution No. 10 was not falsified since the 
evidence show that Bareng actively participated in the deliberation and 
it was the intention of the council to pass a resolution revoking the 
collection of quarry fees. Further, Bareng admitted in open court that 
there are two ways to pass an ordinance or resolution are: (1) the votes
 cast are reflected in the minutes and the members sign the minutes; or 
(2) the votes cast are reflected in the ordinance or resolution itself 
and the Chairman and Secretary sign it.
[36]


In a Resolution
[37]
 dated 
October 14, 2019, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration finding 
no sufficient and valid justification for the procedural error committed
 by petitioners.
[38]


Aggrieved, petitioners filed a petition for review on 
certiorari
[39]

 before this Court.

On March 9, 2020, the Court directed the Clerk of Court of the CA, the 
Office of the Ombudsman and the RTC Branch 16 of Laoag City to elevate 
the complete records of Criminal Case No. 17756-16.
[40]


Petitioner's Arguments


Petitioners admitted that ordinary appeal under Rule 43 of the Rules of 
Court was available to them and it was an honest mistake that a petition
 for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 was resorted to. Thus, in its 
motion for reconsideration before the CA, it immediately complied with 
the requirements under Rule 43. Petitioners added that the resort to the
 special civil action of 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 was based on 
their belief that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in 
issuing its Decision dated May 10, 2016 finding the petitioners guilty 
of grave misconduct and perpetually dismissing them from service.
[41]


Petitioners cited the Order dated August 24, 2018 of the RTC finding 
that Resolution No. 10 was not falsified inasmuch as Bareng actively 
participated in the deliberation of the said resolution. They contend 
that the CA erred in dismissing their petition on procedural grounds 
without considering the merits of the case. Petitioners were not remiss 
in pointing out to the Ombudsman and the CA that the council conducted 
deliberations in relation to the passage of Resolution No. 10. Further, 
Bareng admitted in open court that he participated in the aforementioned
 deliberations. Thus, there was no basis to support the complaint for 
grave misconduct filed against them since Resolution No. 10 was not 
falsified.
[42]


Respondent's Arguments


Even without an order from this Court to file a comment, respondents merely stated that in the Joint Counter-Affidavit
[43]
 and Verified Position Paper
[44]

 of petitioners, they were insistent that the resolution was indeed 
approved and passed during the barangay council's session on November 
16, 2014, which is belied by the minutes of the meeting held on that 
day.
[45]


Issues


The issues to be resolved are: (1) whether the Court of Appeals properly dismissed the Petition for 
Certiorari
 because it was the wrong mode of appeal; and (2) whether petitioners are administratively liable for grave misconduct.


Ruling of the Court


The petition is meritorious.

At the outset, the Court agrees with the CA that the, proper mode of 
appeal on the Decision of the Ombudsman in an administrative case is 
Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court. Decisions, awards, final orders, 
or resolutions of quasi-judicial bodies in the exercise of their 
quasi-judicial functions are appealable under Rule 43. Recourse to a 
special civil action of 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Revised 
Rules of Court is a ground for dismissal for being the wrong remedy. 
However, the Court has allowed a recourse to a Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari
,
 in certain exceptional cases, to wit: (a) when public welfare and the 
advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of 
justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d)
 when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial
 authority.
[46]


In the case of 
Tanenglian
 v. Lorenzo
,
[47]
 the Court treated a petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 as an appeal filed under Rule 43 despite the availability
 of appeal, late payment of appeal fee and the lapse of the 15-day 
appeal period. In that case, Lorenzo and 22 others filed a Petition for 
Redemption of Ancestral Land before the Regional Arbitrator against 
Tanenglian
. The Regional Arbitrator ruled against 
Tanenglian
 and declared the lands under his name to be ancestral lands which were awarded to Lorenzo. 
Tanenglian
 questioned the decision of the Regional Arbitrator via petition for 
certiorari

 before the CA, which the CA dismissed for being the wrong mode of 
appeal. The Court ruled that due to the importance of the issues raised 
in the petition and what the petitioner stands to lose, justice would 
have been better served if the CA resolved the issues instead of 
dismissing the petition on procedural grounds. The Court therein held:


The Court has allowed some meritorious cases to proceed 
despite inherent procedural defects and lapses. This is in keeping with 
the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to 
facilitate the attainment of justice and that strict and rigid 
application of rules which would result in technicalities that tend to 
frustrate rather than promote substantial justice must always be 
avoided. It is a far better and more prudent cause of action for the 
court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the
 case to attain the ends of justice, rather than dispose of the case on 
technicality and cause grave injustice to the parties, giving a false 
impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more 
delay, if not a miscarriage of justice.
[48]


Similar to 
Tanenglian
, petitioners herein availed of petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 instead of a petition for review under Rule 43 to assail 
the decision of the Ombudsman, a quasi-judicial body, in their 
administrative case. They also filed their petition beyond the period of
 appeal under Rule 43. Akin to the Court's ruling in 
Tanenglian
, 
We find that interest of justice will be better served if the petition 
will be given due course rather than deny it on procedural grounds 
particularly because the issues raised by the petitioners are important 
and deserve consideration. Further, petitioners have been imposed the 
penalty of dismissal from office with perpetual disqualification to run 
for public office and to take civil service examination.

Time and again, this Court has exercised its power to suspend or relax 
the rules of procedure upon finding that its rigid application will 
result in obstruction rather than promotion of the interests of justice.
[49]

 However, this power of the Court can only be resorted to in exceptional
 cases such as when the decision rendered was "legally erroneous," 
"patently unjust," or "potentially capable of causing unwarranted and 
irremediable injury or damage to the parties." We rule that the Decision
 of the Ombudsman is patently unjust and caused unwarranted and 
irremediable injury to petitioners since they have not just been 
dismissed from office but also barred from seeking any public office or 
taking the civil service examination despite their innocence.

In this case, the Ombudsman in its Decision dated May 10, 2016 found 
petitioners administratively liable for grave misconduct and meted out 
the penalty of dismissal from service with accessory penalties of 
cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, 
perpetual disqualification from holding public office, and bar from 
taking civil service examination. Petitioners contend that the Ombudsman
 committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of 
jurisdiction in finding them administratively liable for grave 
misconduct.
[50]


Upon judicious review of the records of the case, there is basis to 
overturn the findings of the Ombudsman and absolve the petitioners of 
their administrative liability. The basis for the complaint for grave 
misconduct against petitioners is the alleged falsification of 
Resolution No. 10. The Ombudsman relied on the sworn testimony of Bareng
 that the council did not deliberate on the revocation of Sections 21 
and 26 of the Suyo Revenue Code and that he did not vote on the passage 
of Resolution No. 10.

However, upon review of the minutes of the other sessions of the 
council, the members discussed the revocation of the collection of 
quarry fees, to wit:


October 5, 2014

First Session

x x x x

Agcaoili: The Suyo Lake is a public land. That's what we learned from 
the DENR when asked about it.

Bareng: To be amended.

Captain: To be resolved and it will be specified what will be amended 
including the quarrying.

Galang: When asked before if we are allowed to ask payment in the 
quarrying they said no.

Bareng: It could be because they cannot blame us we do not know. We will
 follow what they told us,

Agcaoili: What shall we do then?

Galang: Revoke the quarrying.

Agcaoili: There should really be a resolution.

Galang: Working is not allowed without certification.

Agcaoili: Of course, it is not allowed without certification.

Captain: Who then? You, apo James being the one in charge in the 
appropriation, you will be the one to go and tell to Jeff Farinas about 
our request.

x x x x
[51]


As a matter of fact, in the Order dated August 24, 2018 of the RTC in 
Criminal Case No. 17756-16, the RTC ruled that Resolution No. 10 was not
 falsified as evidenced by the afore-quoted portion of the minutes of 
the session held on October 5, 2014. There was actual deliberation on 
the revocation of collection of quarry fees and Bareng actively 
participated therein. Further, RTC concluded that it was the intention 
of the council to pass a resolution revoking the collection of quarry 
fees. We quote in part the findings of the RTC, to wit:


The prosecution's assertion that the assailed Barangay 
Resolution could not have been passed owing to the absence of 
deliberation of its passage reflected on the minutes of the meeting is 
of no moment to belie its adoption. To reiterate, Arnold Bareng 
categorically admitted that the assailed Resolution No. 10 Series of 
2014 was passed and that the voting profile for its approval is 
reflected on the "ayes" and "nays" reflected on the resolution itself.

Furthermore, prosecution witness ARNOLD BARENG cannot be permitted to 
feign his ignorance and his participation on the passage of the assailed
 Barangay Resolution considering his categorical declarations that he 
participated in the deliberations of the amendments of the quarry fee 
during the regular sessions on 17 August 2014, 21 September 2014 and 05 
October 2014, of which he himself agreed to the proposed amendments, 
(tsn Arnold Bareng, October 3, 2017 pp 20-21)

It should be emphasized that ARNOLD BARENG explained that the Barangay 
Secretary drafts the resolution on the basis of the minutes of the 
previous regular session approving the same, in which case the minutes 
referred to prior to the 16 November 2014 regular session is the session
 on October 5, 2014, where ARNOLD BARENG agreed to the amendment.
[52]


Thus, even if the revocation was not included in the list of Agenda in 
the minutes of the November 16 session, such fact will not make 
Resolution No. 10 a falsified public document.
[53]

 RTC dismissed the falsification case against the petitioners for lack 
of sufficient evidence to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Petitioners submitted before the Ombudsman and the CA the TSN of the 
testimony of Arnold Bareng in Criminal Case No. 17756-16 and the Order 
of the RTC dismissing the falsification case against them to support 
their claim that Resolution No. 10 was not falsified. Likewise, the 
minutes of the council sessions on September 21, October 5, and November
 16, 2014 were submitted to the Ombudsman as proof that deliberations 
were made on the revocation of Sections 21 and 26 of the Suyo Revenue 
Code.

Despite all these substantial evidence to support their case, the 
Ombudsman ruled against petitioners and held them administratively 
liable for grave misconduct. We hold that the Ombudsman erred in not 
considering the totality of evidence submitted by the parties and in 
focusing solely on the evidence of private respondents Gabriel and 
Bareng to support its decision.

To be held liable for an administrative charge, substantial evidence 
must be proven or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable 
mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. To the mind of 
the Ombudsman, the sworn testimony of Bareng and the minutes of the 
November 16, 2014 session were sufficient to find petitioners 
administratively liable for grave misconduct in falsifying a public 
document.

However, the Ombudsman failed to consider other evidence submitted by 
the petitioners to support their claim that Resolution No. 10 was not a 
falsified public document. As admitted by Bareng in Criminal Case No. 
17756-16, the council deliberated the revocation of collection of quarry
 fees during one of its sessions. Further, he admitted that an ordinance
 or resolution of the barangay can be passed in two methods: (1) the 
votes cast will be reflected in the minutes, signed by the participating
 members and the Secretary will prepare the ordinance or resolution 
based from those votes; or (2) the votes cast will be reflected in the 
ordinance or resolution itself showing the ayes/nays and the Secretary 
will prepare the draft and the Chairman will certify it. Any of these 
two methods is a valid way of enacting an ordinance or resolution. As 
shown in Resolution No. 10, petitioners adopted the second method and 
reflected their votes in the resolution itself as prepared by Secretary 
Adina and certified by Chairman Toledo.

Under the Revised Penal Code, acts of falsification by a public officer 
include the following:


Counterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;

Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;

Attributing to persons who have participated in an act or proceeding statements other than those in fact made by them;

Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;

Altering true dates;

Making any alteration or intercalation in a genuine document which changes its meaning;

Issuing in an authenticated form a document purporting to be a 
copy of an original document when no such original exists, or including 
in such copy a statement contrary to, or different from, that of the 
genuine original; or

Intercalating any instrument or note relative to the issuance thereof in a protocol, registry, or official book.
[54]


None of these acts is present in the case. It was clearly established 
that the barangay council conducted a deliberation about the revocation 
of the collection of quarry fees on October 5, 2014 and the Secretary 
prepared a resolution based on the minutes of that session, which was 
Resolution No. 10. The formal issuance of Resolution No. 10 was done on 
November 16, 2014 reflecting the ayes/nays of the members as prepared by
 the Secretary and certified by the Chairman. This is a parliamentary 
process practiced by the barangay since the term of Bareng as Barangay 
Chairman, which he did not contest. To reiterate, Bareng cannot deny the
 fact that he participated in the deliberations on October 5, 2014 and 
even acceded to the recommendation that a resolution is needed to revoke
 the provision on collection of quarry fees. Thus, there is no 
falsification of a public document committed by the petitioners, as 
correctly held by the RTC. Consequently, the complaint for grave 
misconduct must be dismissed because it was filed on the basis of the 
alleged falsification of Resolution No. 10.

Therefore, we hold that the petitioners cannot be held liable for grave 
misconduct, as described and defined by case law as:


Misconduct is a transgression of some established and 
definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross 
negligence by the public officer. To warrant dismissal from the service,
 the misconduct must be grave, serious, important, weighty, momentous, 
and not trilling. The misconduct must imply wrongful intention and not a
 mere error of judgment and must also have a direct relation to and be 
connected with the performance of the public officer's official duties 
amounting either to maladministration or willful, intentional neglect, 
or failure to discharge the duties of the office. In order to 
differentiate gross misconduct from simple misconduct, the elements of 
corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of 
established rule, must be manifest in the former.
[55]


There was no falsification of public document. There was no wrongful 
intent on the part of the petitioners in enacting Resolution No. 10 as 
they did so only to address the public clamor against the imposition of 
quarry fees and fees on fishing gadgets. Furthermore, they were informed
 that the barangay does not have the authority to impose quarry fees as 
that power is lodged with the provincial government in accordance with 
the Local Government Code. As stated by the petitioners, they were 
merely following the law.

All told, the petitioners were merely performing their duties in 
accordance with law when they passed Resolution No. 10. Thus, they must 
not be administratively disciplined for grave misconduct which requires a
 finding that there was wrongful intent to violate the law or failure to
 discharge their duties, and there was none in this case.
