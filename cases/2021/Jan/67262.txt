INTING, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition
[1]
 for Review on 
Certiorari
 filed pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated December 28, 2016 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated March 16, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 
103462. The assailed Decision and Resolution affirmed the Decision
[4]

 dated May 19, 2014 of Branch 11, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Malolos 
City, Bulacan in Civil Case No. 486-M-2005 which dismissed the complaint
 for lack ofmerit. 
[5]


The Antecedents




The present controversy stemmed from a 4,086-square meter (sq.m.) 
property situated in Inaon, Pulilan, Bulacan (subject property) owned by
 the Spouses Arsenio and Julita Sulit (Julita) (collectively, Spouses 
Sulit).
[6]
 Arsenio is now deceased.


 Spouses Sulit begot six children namely: Alfredo, Rufino, Rodolfo, 
Juan, Efren, married to Eugenia (Spouses Efren Sulit), and Zenaida, 
married to Eugenio Alfonso (Spouses Alfonso).


Alfredo, Rufino, Rodolfo, and Juan (collectively, heirs of Arsenio) are herein petitioners;
[7]
 whereas Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso are among the herein private respondents.
[8]
 


On October 15, 1979, a Deed of Absolute Sale
[9]

 was executed by Spouses Sulit which conveyed their 4,086-sq.m. property
 in favor of their two children: Efren and Zenaida for a consideration 
of P3,000.00. Upon registration of the sale, Transfer Certificate of 
Title (TCT) No. T-257536 was issued to Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses 
Alfonso.
[10]


 Two months later, or on December 6, 1979, a counter Deed of Sale
[11]
 was executed by Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso which reconveyed the subject property to their parents, Spouses Sulit.
[12]
 


Despite the foregoing, Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso caused
 the subdivision of the subject property and sold portions thereof to 
the following: 


(a) Private respondents Spouses Reynaldo P. Dizon and 
Norma Reyes (Spouses Dizon) which consisted of 2,043 sq.m. with TCT No. 
T-15277
[13]
 issued in their 
favor. This was then subdivided to Lots 1 to 6. An annotation as an 
entry in TCT No. T- 15277 was a conveyance of "Lot 2" in favor of 
private respondent Crisanta A. Magtalas (Magtalas).
[14]
 Spouses Dizon then sold back portibns
[15]

 thereof to Spouses Alfonso who in turn sold different portions of the 
subject property to their children, as follows: (1) Lot 4 to private 
respondent Elita S. Alfonso (Elita),
[16]
 (2) Lot 3 to private respondent Edwin Alfonso (Edwin);
[17]
 and (3) Lot 5 to private respondent Eiselle Alfonso (Eiselle).
[18]
 Further, Lot 6 was sold to Elaine Alfonso.
[19]
 


(b) Private respondents Spouses Manolito S. Esguerra and Juliana G. 
Esguerra (Spouses Esguerra) which comprised of 325 sq.m. with TCT No. 
T-15275
[20]
 issued in their favor; and


c) Private respondents Spouses Guillermo Manalili and Erlinda 
Manalili (Spouses Manalili) which consisted of 1,000 sq.m. with TCT No. 
T-1527421 issued in their favor. 


The conveyaces prompted the filing of a Complaint
[22]

 for Annulment of Sale and/or Declaration of Nullity of Title, 
Reconveyance and Damages with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of 
Preliminary IJliunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order by 
petitioners against the following herein private respondents: (1) 
Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso; and (2) Spouses Dizon, 
Magtalas, Elita, Edwin, Eiselle, Spouses Esguerra, Spouses Manalili, and
 Leonilo Danilo Disor (Disor) (collectively, private 
respondents-purchasers). Petitioners likewise impleaded public 
respondent Register of Deeds of Bulacan as defendant. Aside from the 
aforementioned conveyances, petitioners added that Spouses Efren Sulit 
and Spouses Alfonso likewise sold 718 sq.m. to Spouses Maximo S. Dinong 
and Priscilla S. Dinong (Spouses Dinong), who in turn, sold it to Disor.
[23]
 


Petitioners argued that Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso had 
no authority to convey the subject property as they were merely holding 
them in trustfor Spouses Sulit.
[24]

 While petitioners admitted the execution of the Deed of Sale, they 
posited that Spouses Sulit, during their lifetime, entrusted the subject
 property and merely accommodated the request of their children, Efren 
and Zenaida, for capital for a business transaction.
[25]

 In addition, petitioners alluded that Spouses Sulit never divested 
themselves of ownership over the subject property due to the execution 
of a counter Deed of Sale to protect their interests.
[26]
 


In response, private respondents moved for the dismissal of the action
[27]

 for the following grounds: (a) failure to comply with a condition 
precedent as to the requirement of earnest efforts towards a compromise 
because the suit involved family members; (b) defect in the 
certification against forum shopping for lack of signature by one of the
 plaintiffs; and (c) prescription. Petitioners opposed
[28]
 the motion for dismissal. The RTC acted favorably on petitioner's opposition in an Order
[29]
 dated February 17, 2006.


 Private respondents then filed their Answer with Counterclaim
[30]

 wherein they countered that Spouses Sulit intended to donate the 
subject property to Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso with a 
condition for its return in case the sellers needed financial 
assistance.
[31]
 They alluded that they resorted to executing a Deed of Sale for the purpose of convenience in registration.
[32]

 Private respondents also admitted that the counter Deed of Sale dated 
December 6, 1979 was executed without monetary consideration, or 
otherwise; thus, they asserted that the subsequent conveyances of the 
subject property by Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso were a valid
 exercise of their ownership rights which were made in good faith and 
for value.
[33]
 With respect to
 the sale in favor of Spouses Dizon, private respondents contended that a
 subdivision and consolidation were effected that included the other 
property of the Spouses Alfonso registered as TCT No. RT-14285 (T- 
96270)34 consisting of 1,161 sq.m. before the sale of a portion thereof 
to Magtalas.
[35]
 Lastly, 
private respondents supported their claim of ownership with a prior 
ruling of the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Pulilan, Bulacan in Civil 
Case No. 790 in an unlawful detainer case which ordered Spouses Sulit to
 vacate a portion of the subject property now owned by Eiselle.
[36]


 During the proceedings, the parties admitted that on September 17, 
1999, Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso filed a complaint against 
their own parents, Spouses Sulit, for the declaration of nullity of the 
counter Deed of Sale dated December 6, 1979, but this was dismissed by 
Branch 8, RTC, Malolos City, Bulacan in its Order dated August 5, 2002 
in Civil Case No. 948-M-99;
[37]
 it ruled that both Deeds of Sale dated October 15, 1979 and December 6, 1979 were invalid for lack of consideration.
[38]

 The Decision was affirmed by the CAin its Decision dated April 30, 2004
 docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 77496 which already attained finality.
[39]
 


On this ground, petitioners moved for summary judgment.
[40]
 However, the RTC denied it in an Order
[41]

 dated June 5, 2007 as it found genuine factual issues that can be 
resolved only after the parties have presented their respective 
evidence. 


Ruling of the RTC


On May 19, 2014, the RTC rendered a Decision
[42]

 dismissing the complaint for lack of merit. The RTC ruled that the 
action for reconveyance and annulment of title has already prescribed 
because the original complaint was filed on July 7, 2005 which was more 
than 10 years from the execution of the questioned sale transactions and
 their subsequent registration that caused the issuance of certificates 
of title on the subject property.
[43]

 Further, it noted the Order dated August 5, 2002 of Branch 8, RTC, 
Malolos City, Bulacan in Civil Case No. 948-M-99 as well as the CA 
Decision
[44]
 dated April 30, 2004 in CA-G.R. CV No. 77496 which already nullified the first Deed of Sale dated October 15, 1979.
[45]
 


The RTC also concluded that, assuming an implied trust was created by
 operation of law based on the allegation of fraud in the acquisition of
 the subject property, prescription already barred the filing of the 
action.
[46]
 In any case, the 
RTC observed that pursuant to the Torrens system, private 
respondents-purchasers had no duty to go beyond what the Torrens title 
indicated.
[47]
 The alleged 
trust was neither annotated in the title of the subject property nor was
 the private respondents-purchasers' knowledge thereof proven.
[48]

 Thus, the RTC concluded that in the absence of an allegation of bad 
faith on the part of private respondents-purchasers, the presumption 
that the latter were buyers in good faith must prevail.
[49]
 


Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, However, the RTC denied it in an Order
[50]
 dated July 21, 2014. Petitioners went to theCA to question the RTC Decision. 


Ruling of the CA

In its Decision
[51]
 dated 
December 28, 2016, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the dismissal 
of the complaint by the RTC, but ruled against the prescription of the 
action.
Contrary to the RTC, the CA ruled against prescription and explained 
that the prior ruling of the RTC, Malolos City, Bulacan in Civil Case 
No. 948-M-99 which declared the Deeds of Sale dated October 15, 1979 and
 December 6, 1979 as null and void made the subject action for 
reconveyance based on a void contract imprescriptible.
[52]

 However, the CA held that the conveyance of the subject property in 
favor of innocent purchasers for value and in good faith precluded an 
action for reconveyance.
[53]
 
For the CA, private respondents-purchasers were not required to make any
 further investigation on the title of the subject property and their 
reliance upon what appears on the face of the certificate of title is 
protected under the principle of indefeasibility and incontrovertibility
 of a title under the Torrens system.
[54]

 The CA applied the same principle to Eiselle, Elita, and Edwin, who are
 children of Spouses Alfonso, in the absence of proof that they were not
 of age, and thus, with no capacity to contract during the time of sale.
[55]

 Lastly, although the CA called upon petitioners to respect the Torrens 
title of private respondents-purchasers, it opined that petitioners may 
still seek damages against Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso.
[56]
 
The dispositive portion of the assailed CA Decision reads: 



WHEREFORE, the instant Appeal is DENIED. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City, Branch 11, in 
Civil Case No. 486-M-2005

 is hereby AFFIRMED, based on the ground that the subject property have 
passed to the hands of innocent purchasers, for value and in good faith.
 Plaintiffs-appellants are barred under the said principle from 
recovering the lots now owned by defendant-appellee spouses Reynaldo and
 Norma Dizon, defendant-appellee spouses Manolito and Juliana Esguerra, 
defendant-appellee spouses Guillermo and Erlinda Manalili, 
defendant-appellee Leonilo Danilo Disor defendant-appellee Crisanta 
Magtalas, Defendant-appellee Eiselle Alfonso, defendant-appellee Elita 
Alfonso and defendant-appellee Edwin Alfonso.


 SO ORDERED.
[57]


Aggrieved, petitioners elevated the CA Decision to the Court 
via
 a petition for review on 
certiorari
.




The main issues for resolution in this case are whether the CA 
committed reversible error in: (1) ruling that petitioners are barred 
from recovering the subject property on the ground that private 
respondentsÂ­ purchasers were innocent purchasers for value and in good 
faith; and (2) not awarding damages in favor of petitioners, who had 
already impleaded Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso as parties in 
the case below.




Petitioners reiterate that they have been in continuous occupation 
and possession of the subject property, with a rest house constructed 
therein, that should have put private respondents-purchasers on guard to
 prompt a conduct of a meticulous investigation in determining the 
nature of possession of Spouses Sulit.
[58]

 Otherwise stated, petitioners would want to convince the Court that 
private respondents-purchasers were not innocent purchasers under the 
circumstances of the case making the subsequent transfers and issuance 
of certificates of title in the latter's favor as equally null and void.
[59]


 Petitioners likewise insinuate that the CA's reliance on the lone 
affidavit of Juliana Esguerra (Juliana) was self-serving and 
insufficient to prove that all private respondents-purchasers herein 
were buyers in good faith.
[60]


 Petitioners further opine that the transfers to third parties were a
 strategy to further deprive them of their ownership of portions of the 
subject property and place it beyond their reach, particularly the 
conveyances in favor of Eiselle, Elita, and Edwin, who even lacked the 
capacity to contract, being then teenagers, with no capacity to buy 
portions of the subject property.
[61]
 


Lastly, petitioners emphasize that it would be the height of 
injustice to require them, who are already of advanced age, to file a 
separate action for damages against Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses 
Alfonso when the latter were already duly impleaded and proven liable 
herein.
[62]


In their Comment,
[63]
 
private respondents-purchasers recount that petitioners failed to 
present evidence to show that they were not purchasers for value and in 
good faith for their knowledge of the alleged flaw in the title of 
Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso at the time of purchase.
[64]

 They further refute the existence of the trust which was not annotated 
on the certificates of title that would bolster knowledge of the flaw or
 defect in the ownership of Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso.
[65]

 For private respondents, the nipa hut constructed on the subject 
property cannot also be considered notice to third persons of 
petitioners' ownership thereof in the absence of evidence that it was 
registered in the name of Spouses Sulit.
[66]

 They furthermore argue that the issuance of certificates of title to 
Spouses Dizon, Spouses Esguerra, and Spouses Manalili on October 24, 
1991, to Spouses Alfonso on August 26, 1985, and to Eiselle, Elita, and 
Edwin on March 11, 1994 were before the Court rendered the October 15, 
1979 Deed of Sale as null and void; thus, it cannot be said that Spouses
 Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso had knowledge that the conveyance was a
 nullity.
[67]






Our Ruling




The petition is impressed with merit.

Preliminarily, private respondents raise the procedural issue of whether the instant petition for review on 
certiorari

 should be dismissed as the verification and certification against forum
 shopping were signed by Alfredo, as one of the petitioners, without any
 showing that he was authorized to represent his co-petitioners.


The Court resolves in the negative.


 In a number of cases,
[68]
 
the Court found substantial compliance with the rules on verification 
and certification against forum shopping when a petitioner signatory is a
 relative of the other co-petitioners sharing a common interest in a 
disputed property invoking a common cause of action or defense. In light
 of the common interests shared by Alfredo-one of the children of 
Arsenio, with his mother Julita and the other children/heirs of Arsenio,
 namely, Rufino, Rodolfo and Juan, the rules on the matter are deemed 
substantially complied with by the verification and certification 
against forum shopping signed by Alfredo.


 On the merits of the case.


 The Court recognizes that the issue of whether one is an innocent 
purchaser for value is a question of fact which, as a rule, is beyond 
the ambit of the Court.
[69]
 
Nevertheless, when the findings of the CA are contrary to that of the 
RTC, an inquiry into the facts of the case is imperative as in this case
 where the RTC did not dwell into the merits and dismissed the complaint
 on the ground of prescription which the CA found inapplicable in view 
of the possession of petitioners.


This case involves another unfortunate property dispute among blood 
relatives. It is important to note that the earlier controversy 
concerning the validity of the Deed of Sale dated October 5, 1979 
between Spouses Sulit, on the one hand, and Spouses Efren Sulit and 
Spouses Alfonso on the other, had already been resolved with finality by
 the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 77496
[70]

 wherein it declared the Deed of Sale in favor of Spouses Efren Sulit 
and Spouses Alfonso as well as the counter Deed of Sale as void for lack
 of consideration. Hence, pursuant to the well-settled principle that no
 one can give what one does not have, 
nemo dat quod non habet
, 
Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso acquired no right over the 
subject property which they could have validly conveyed to private 
respondent-purchasers.
[71]
 All
 the transactions subsequent to the void sale among Spouses Sulit, 
Spouses Efren Sulit, and Spouses Alfonso are likewise void, including 
the subject sale made by Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso to 
private respondents-purchasers.
[72]
 Quod nullum est, nullum producit effectum
.
[73]

 Needless to state, all subsequent certificates of title, including 
private respondents-purchasers' titles, are also void because of the 
legal truism that the spring carmot rise higher than its source.
[74]


The foregoing notwithstanding, it is well-settled that even if the 
procurement of a certificate of title was tainted with fraud and 
misrepresentation, a title may be the source of a completely legal and 
valid title in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value.
[75]

 Where innocent third persons, relying on the correctness of the 
certificate of title thus issued, acquire rights over the property, the 
Court carmot disregard these rights and order the total cancellation of 
the certificate.
[76]
 This 
doctrine emphasizes that a person who deals with registered property in 
good faith could acquire good title even from a forger or a fraud and be
 absolutely protected by a Torrens title.
[77]


 As a general rule, a prospective buyer is not required by law to 
inquire further than what appears on the face of the prospective 
seller's Torrens certificate of title on file with the Register of Deeds
 when dealing with registered land.
[78]

 In the case at hand, because the sale was made pursuant to the alleged 
ownership of Spouses Alfonso and Spouses Efren Sulit as supported by the
 Torrens title registered in their names, it becomes crucial for the 
Court to determine whether Spouses Dizon, Spouses Esguerra, Spouses 
Manalili, Disor, Eiselle, Elita, Edwin, and Magtalas were purchasers in 
good faith and for value who are entitled to protection under our 
Torrens system of registration.


 A purchaser in good faith and for value is one who buys the property
 of another without notice that some other person has a right to or 
interest in that same property and who pays a full and fair price at the
 time of the purchase or before receiving any notice of another person's
 claim. Purchasers cannot close their eyes to known facts that should 
put a reasonable person on guard and subsequently claim to have acted in
 good faith in the belief that there was no defect in the vendor's 
certificate of title.
[79]
 
Their mere refusal to face up to that possibility will not make them 
innocent purchasers for value if it later becomes apparent that the 
title was indeed defective and that they would have discovered the fact 
had they acted with the measure of precaution required of a prudent 
person in a similar situation.
[80]


 Initially, the burden of proving the status of a purchaser in good faith lies upon one who asserts that status and this 
onus probandi
 cannot be discharged by mere invocation of the legal presumption of good faith.
[81]
 Although private respondents theorize that there is no allegation in the Second Amended Complaint
[82]
 that the subject property was purchased in bad faith,
[83]
 their Answer with Counterclaim
[84]
 evinced otherwise when they asserted that private respondents-purchasers were transferees/buyers in good faith.
[85]

 Private respondents would do well to remember that in civil cases, the 
specific rule as to the burden of proof is that the plaintiffs have the 
burden of proving the material allegations of the complaint which are 
denied by the answer, and defendants have the burden of proving the 
material allegations in their answer which sets up a new matter as a 
defense.
[86]
 It should be 
mentioned that this rule does not involve a shifting of the burden of 
proof but merely that each party must establish his/her own case.
[87]


 Despite private respondents' assertion that private respondentsÂ­ 
purchasers were irnocent purchasers for value,. they only presented 
Juliana, wife of Ma,1olito Esguerra, who testified on the basis of a 
Judicial Affidavit.
[88]
 Guillermo Manalili likewise executed a Judicial Affidavit,
[89]

 but nothing in the records indicated that he personally testified in 
open court, or that his Judicial Affidavit was offered in evidence. 
Section 6 of the Judicial Affidavit Rule
[90]
 under "Offer of and Objections to Testimony in Judicial Affidavit" states that, 
[t]he
 party presenting the judicial affidavit of his witness in place of 
direct testimony shall state the purpose of such testimony at the start 
of the presentation of the witness
. Without the presentation of the 
person who executed the Judicial Affidavit, which in this case was 
Guillermo Manalili, his Judicial Affidavit cannot be considered by the 
Court.


 From the foregoing, private respondents are left with the lone 
testimony of Juliana to establish that all of the private 
respondentÂ­purchasers are innocent purchasers for value. It is worth 
stressing that good faith, or the lack of it is a question of intention 
which could be ascertained only from the acts of one claiming its 
presence, for it is a condition of the mind which can be judged by 
actual or fancied token or signs.
[91]

 It is not a visible, tangible fact that can be seen or touched, but 
rather a state or condition of mind manifested by the acts of the 
individual concemed.
[92]
 Good 
faith being a state of mind, only private respondents-purchasers 
themselves could personally attest as to how the observed the required 
diligence in the purchase of real property. Juliana's testimony alone is
 insufficient to establish that all the private respondents-purchasers 
herein were equally purchasers in good faith. As a matter of fact, even 
the offer of Juliana's testimony merely covered her own alleged status 
as a purchaser in good faith and for value.
[93]

 Without evidence to establish good faith, the Court finds that Spouses 
Dizon, Spouses Manalili, Disor, Eiselle, Elita, Edwin, and Magtalas have
 failed to discharge the burden of proving that they were innocent 
purchasers for value.


Concomitantly, as to Juliana's status as an innocent purchaser for 
value of a registered and titled land, she need only show that she, 
together with her husband, Manolito, relied on the face of the title to 
the property of their seller without further inquiry beyond the four 
corners thereof. Nevertheless, this degree of proof of good faith is 
only sufficient when the following conditions concur: 
first
, the seller is the registered owner of the land; 
second
, the seller is in possession thereof; and 
third
,
 at the time of the sale, the buyer was not aware of any claim or 
interest of some other person in the property, or of any defect or 
restriction in the title of the seller or in his capacity to convey 
title to the property.
[94]


 In the case at bench, the totality of evidence preponderates in 
favor of petitioners. Records of the case would reveal that Alfredo 
testified that he knew private respondents-purchasers and identified 
Spouses Esguerra and Spouses Manalili as his townmates,
[95]
 while Magtalas was his neighbor.
[96]

 Even more telling is the fact that Spouses Alfonso sold portions of the
 subject property to their own children, Eiselle, Elita, and Edwin. 
Although Eiselle, Elita, and Edwin were not privy to the arrangement 
between their parents and their own grandparents as regards the subject 
property, their relationship had involuntarily placed them in a position
 of advantage to readily obtain information on the actual ownership of 
the subject property. There can be no doubt that with the status of 
Eiselle, Elita, and Edwin as children of Spouses Alfonso and 
grandchildren of Julita, and of the private respondents-purchasers as 
townmates and neighbors, they were made aware or were in theÂ·position to
 be aware of the tactual background of the subject property and the 
personal circutnstances of the real owners thereof. It would have been 
usual and part of ordinary human nature for them to inquire about the 
subject property considering that the families of Spouses Efren Sulit 
and Spouses Alfonso are not total strangers to them. Without any proof 
to establish their good faith in the acquisition of respective portions 
of the subject property, the Court must yield to the evidence adduced.


Equally significant, the statements made by Juliana in her Judicial 
Affidavit were also unconvincing, if not, contrary to the theory 
espoused by private respondents. Despite Juliana's claim that she was 
familiar with the subject property which is located in the same place 
where she is also a resident, she testified that there were no 
structures in the entire subject property and even described it as a 
vacant lot
[97]
-glaringly 
inconsistent with what appears on the records of the case. Although 
private respondents downplayed the structure as a mere nipa hut, their 
allegation that it was not sufficient notice to third persons in the 
absence of its registration in the name of Julita is specious.
[98]
 Assuming 
arguendo

 that the structure does not belong to Spouses Sulit, nothing prevented 
private respondents to show proof that it belonged and was constructed 
by Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso which would even buttress 
their claim of ownership and buyer in good faith status.

When a person proposes to buy or deal with realty, it is his/her duty to
 read the public manuscript, that is, to look and see who is there upon 
it and what his/her rights are.
[99]

 A want of caution and diligence which an honest person of ordinary 
prudence is accustomed to exercise in making purchases, is in 
contemplation of law, a want of good faith. A buyer who has failed to 
know or discover that the land sold to him/her is in adverse possession 
of another is a buyer in bad faith.
[100]

 As a purchaser, Juliana cannot simply close her eyes to facts which 
should put a reasonable man on his/her guard and then claim that she 
acted in good faith under the belief that there was no defect in the 
title of her vendor. She would have noticed the defect had she acted 
with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a 
prudent man in a similar situation.


While the subject property was registered to Spouses Efren Sulit and 
Spouses Alfonso, there were circumstances herein which would have 
impelled a reasonably cautious man to make an inquiry into the status of
 the title of the property in litigation. It was no longer sufficient 
for Juliana to merely show that she relied on the face of the title as 
she must also now substantiate that they exercised reasonable precaution
 by inquiring beyond the title. This circumstance alone demonstrated the
 lack of diligence of Spouses Esguerra in their dealings involving the 
subject property. Unfortunately, the Court cannot ascribe good faith to 
persons who have not shown any diligence in protecting their rights. The
 rest house or nipa hut is evidence of petitioners' exercise of 
possession over the subject property which obliges any buyer thereof to 
observe a higher degree of diligence by scrutinizing the certificate of 
title and examining all factual circumstances in order to determine the 
seller's title and capacity to transfer any interest in the property. 
Juliana's failure to exercise this degree of precaution precluded her 
status as an innocent purchaser for value nor as a purchaser in good 
faith; 
[101]
 hence, she does 
not merit the protection ofthe law.

Veritably, the nullity of the conveyances as well as the Torrens title 
issued to private respondents rendered Spouses Sulit as the rightful 
owners of the subject property and the reconveyance thereof in their 
favor are but proper. In addition, the Register of Deeds of Bulacan 
should cause the cancellation of the certificates of title issued to 
herein private respondents-purchasers and, consequently, the 
reinstatement of the certificate of title in favor of the Spouses Sulit 
is in order. The pronouncement herein is, of course, without prejudice 
to any remedy which private respondents-purchasers may have against 
their co-private respondents, Spouses Efren Sulit and Spouses Alfonso, 
who sold portions of the subject property in their favor. 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
GRANTED
. The Decision dated 
December 28, 2016 and the Resolution dated March 16, 2017 rendered by 
the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 103462 are hereby 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Accordingly, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: 






(a) the sale transactions of portions of the subject property by 
Spouses Efren and Eugenia Sulit and Spouses Eugenio and Zenaida Alfonso 
in favor of Spouses Reynaldo P. Dizon and Norma Reyes, Spouses. Manolito
 S. Esguerra and Juliana G. Esguerra, Spouses Guillermo Manalili and Erlinda Manalili, Crisanta A Magtalas, Leonilo Danilo Disor, Elita S. 
Alfonso, Edwin Alfonso, and Eiselle Alfonso are declared null and void;


(b) the subject property shall be reconveyed to Spouses Arsenio and Julita Sulit;


(c) the Register of Deeds of Bulacan is ordered to cancel TCT No. 
T-257536 in the name of Efren Sulit, married to Eugenia, and Zenaida 
Alfonso married to Eugenio; and all the subsequent certificates of title
 issued thereafter covering the subject property, particularly TCT No.
