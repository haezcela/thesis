GRACE CRISILDA A. PANTALEON, PETITIONER, VS. OMBUDSMAN-MINDANAO, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




INTING, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review
[1]
 on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to annul and set aside the Decision
[2]
 dated February 1, 2019 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated July 18, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 07780-MIN which affirmed the Decision
[4]

 dated September 29, 2016 of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao 
(Ombudsman) in OMB-M-A-15-0569 fmding Grace Crisilda A. Pantaleon 
(petitioner) administratively liable for Grave Misconduct and Serious 
Dishonesty.

The following facts are not disputed: 


Petitioner previously served as Revenue Clerk II of the Municipal Government of Barobo, Surigao del Sur.



On October 8, 2015[,] a Joint Affidavit Complaint for the criminal 
and administrative charges was filed by State Auditors Cheryl 
Cantalejo-Dime and Pamela Grace A. Arayan of the Commission on Audit - 
Regional Office No. XIII (COA), against petitioner before the Deputy 
Ombudsman.



The Complaint alleged that on June 23, 2013, the COA conducted an 
examination of the petitioner's cash and accounts for the period of 
December 18, 2012 to June 26, 2013. The audit revealed a cash shortage 
in the aggregate amount of P436,748.45. A demand letter was not issued 
as petitioner was able to restitute the full amount on September 6, 
2013. On October 8, 2015, the COA instituted the complaint against" 
petitioner before the Deputy Ombudsman.



In her Counter-Affidavit, petitioner admitted [the] cash shortage but
 denied to having converted the same for her personal use and benefit. 
She claimed she lent the money to her co-workers who had financial 
problems. She stressed that she had already restituted the full amount 
even before a demand was issued.
[5]




On September 29, 2016, the Ombudsman rendered a Decision,
[6]
 the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE, the Office finds respondent Grace Crisilda A. 
Pantaleon GUILTY of Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty. She is 
meted out the penalty of DISMISSAL from service, including the accessory
 penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement 
benefits, and the perpetual disqualification for reÂ­ employment in the 
government service. Considering that respondent is found guilty of two 
charges, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the 
most serious charge and the other shall be considered as an aggravating 
circumstance.



 In the event that the penalty can no longer be enforced due to 
respondent's separation from service, it shall be converted into a Fine 
in the amount of her salary for one year, payable to the Office of the 
Ombudsman, and may be deducted from her retirement benefits, accrued 
leave credits or any receivable from the government.



Mayor Felixberto S. Urbiztondo of the Municipal Government of Barobo,
 Surigao del Sur, is directed to implement the penalty meted out against
 respondent, within ten days from receipt hereof, and to submit to the 
Office, within the same period, a Compliance Report indicating the 
docket number of this case.



Further, the COA- Regional Office No. XIII, Butnan City is directed 
to conduct a special audit investigation on the alleged practice in the 
Municipal Government of Barobo, Surigao del Sur, of allowing employees 
to borrow from its tax collections, and to file complaints against 
responsible officials before the Office, if the evidence so warrants. 
Let the COA - Regional Office No. XIII, Butnan City be furnished a copy 
of this Resolution.



SO ORDERED.
[7]




In the Decision
[8]
 dated 
February 1, 2019, the CA affirmed the Ombudsman. Petitioner moved for 
reconsideration, but it was denied on July 18, 2019.
[9]
 


Hence, this petition.


 The principal issue is whether there exists substantial evidence to 
hold petitioner administratively liable for Grave Misconduct and Serious
 Dishonesty. 


The Court's Ruling


The petition lacks merit.


As a general rule, factual findings of the Ombudsman are conclusive 
when supported by substantial evidence and are accorded due respect and 
weight, especially when affirmed by the CA.
[10]
 


In the present case, petitioner is charged with Grave Misconduct and 
Dishonesty before the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman found her guilty of Grave
 Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty, and imposed on her the penalty of 
dismissal from govermnent service with all its accessory penalties. On 
appeal to the CA, it affirmed the ruling of the Ombudsman.


The Ombudsman and the CA correctly found petitioner guilty of Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty.


 The Court does not find merit in petitioner's contentions that she 
had made full restitution of the cash shortage before the formal demand 
by the Commission on Audit; that she did not personally use the 
municipal funds as she merely lent them to her co-workers; and that her 
length of service, unblemished record, and good faith should be 
considered as mitigating circumstances.


Misconduct "means wrongful, improper or unlawful conduct motivated by a premeditated, obstinate or intentional purpose."
[11]
 It is "intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior."
[12]

 To constitute an administrative offense, the misconduct should relate 
to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and 
duties of a public officer.
[13]

 Misconduct is a "transgression of some established and definite rule of
 action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a 
public officer."
[14]


In Grave Misconduct, the "elements of corruption, clear intent to 
violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule must be 
manifest."
[15]


 Dishonesty, on the other hand, is defined as the "disposition to 
lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness, lack of integrity."
[16]

 Under Section 3 of the Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 06-0538 
or the Rules on the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty, Dishonesty is 
considered serious when any of the following circumstances is present: 


 
 
 
(1)
 
 
The dishonest act caused senous damage and grave prejudice to the government; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
The respondent gravely abused his authority in order to commit the dishonest act;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)
 
 
Where
 the respondent is an accountable officer, the dishonest act directly 
involves property; accountable forms or money for which he is directly 
accountable; and respondent shows intent to commit material gain, graft 
and corruption;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
The dishonest act exhibits moral depravity on the part of the respondent;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
 
The
 respondent employed fraud and/or falsification of official documents in
 the commission of the dishonest act related to his/her employment;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
 
The dishonest act was committed several times or on various occasions;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(7)
 
 
The
 dishonest act involves a Civil Service examination irregularity or fake
 Civil Service eligibility such as, but not limited to, impersonation, 
cheating and use of crib sheets; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(8)
 
  Other analogous circumstances.
[17]
 
 
 


Both Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty are classified as grave 
offenses with the penalty of dismissal even for first time offenders.
[18]
 


Here, petitioner herself admitted that she loaned the public funds 
entrusted to her to her co-workers without any legal authority to do so.
 Indeed, as Municipal Revenue Clerk, petitioner had the sworn duty to 
safely keep the public funds and to disburse them only in accordance 
with the law and rules.
[19]
 
Petitioner's position as Revenue Clerk involved a proprietary function 
that is imbued with trust and confidence. She being an accountable 
officer and despite being fully aware of the duties and responsibilities
 attendant to her position as Revenue Clerk of the Municipality of 
Barobo, Surigao del Sur, petitioner's improper and unauthorized act of 
lending the municipality funds to her co-workers showed not only her 
intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule,
 but also her disposition to lie, deceive, or defraud; 
untrustworthiness; and lack of integrity.


Under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,
 Serious Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct are grave offenses punishable 
by dismissal from the service.
[20]

 Hence, there is no other penalty that should be imposed on petitioner 
than the penalty of dismissal. The penalty of dismissal from service 
carries with it the following administrative disabilities: 


 
 
 
(a)
 
 
cancellation of civil service eligibility;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
 
forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)
 
 
perpetual
 disqualification from reemployment in any government agency or 
instrumentality, including any government-owned and -controlled 
corporation or government financial institution; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d)
 
bar from taking civil service examinations.
[21]
 
 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED
. The Decision dated 
February 1, 2019 and the Resolution dated July 18, 2019 of the Court of 
Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 07780-MIN are 
AFFIRMED
.


Accordingly, petitioner Grace Crisilda A. Pantaleon is hereby found 
GUILTY
 of Grave Misconduct and Serious Dishonesty, and is thus, 
DISMISSED
 from the service. Accordingly, her civil service eligibility is 
CANCELLED
, and her retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, are 
FORFEITED
. Further, she is 
PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED

 from reemployment in any government agency or instrumentality, 
including any government-owned and -controlled corporation, or 
government financial institution, and 
BARRED
 from taking the civil service examinations.
