The Version of the Prosecution


On September 2, 2015, at around 1:00 a.m., private complainant Police Inspector Bob Belver 
y

 Tabliga (Belver) was alighting from a bus in front of Bicol Express 
Eatery in Alabang Viaduct, Muntinlupa City when he was approached by 
three men, later identified as Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes. The 
three men then declared a robbery and Valencia then snatched Belver's 
backpack while the other accused attempted to take his hanger bag, but 
the latter failed to do so. During the hold-up, Belver informed Poquiz, 
Valencia, and Olorfenes that he was a police officer, however, none of 
them stopped and instead replied "
walang pulis-pulis sa amin
." 
Poquiz then attempted to thrust a knife towards Belver, but Belver was 
able to evade such thrust. Olorfenes and Valencia then started punching 
and kicking Belver. Acting in self-defense, Belver then took his service
 pistol and fired at the feet of Valencia and Poquiz. The three men then
 quickly fled and left behind their knives and Belver's bag.
[6]
 


Upon hearing the gunshots, Police Officer 3 Elvi Ferranculo (PO3 
Ferranculo) and Police Officer 1 John Paul Muego (PO1 Muego) arrived at 
the scene of the crime. Upon learning of the robbery and mauling 
incident, the two police officers brought Belver to the police station 
to have a blotter report recorded. Belver was then examined by 
Medico-Legal Officer Police Senior Inspector Dr. Rhea Manaba Cornelio 
for his physical injuries.
[7]
 
Upon information from Belver's statement, PO3 Ferranculo and PO1 Muego 
proceeded to Ospital ng Muntinlupa to check any person admitted for 
gunshot wounds. The two police officers then found Poquiz and Valencia 
who were both being treated for gunshot wounds in their right foot and 
left leg, respectively.
[8]


During his testimony, Belver positively identified Poquiz, Valencia 
and Olorfenes as his assailants. Belver also identified the knives used 
by the three men during the incident. Belver confirmed that he did not 
lose his items as he was duly able to recover his bag when Poquiz, 
Valencia and Olorfenes dropped the said items when the men fled after 
drawing his service firearm.
[9]

 PO3 Ferranculo testified and confirmed that he and PO1 Muego responded 
to the crime scene upon hearing the sound of gunshots. PO3 Ferranculo 
asserted that after accompanying Belver to the precinct to blotter the 
incident, he and PO1 Muego went to the Ospital ng Muntinlupa to look for
 possible victims of gunshot wounds and found Poquiz and Valencia 
therein.
[10]


 The prosecution also offered the following as documentary evidence: (1) 
Salaysay
 of Belver; (2) 
Malayang Sinumpaang Salaysay ng Pag-aresto

 by PO3 Ferranculo and PO1 Muego; (3) Request for Medico-Legal 
Examination; (4) Medico-Legal Report dated September 2, 2015; (5) 
photograph of the items forcibly taken from Belver during the robbery; 
(6) photographs of the knives used; and (7) certified true copy of the 
Police Blotter. The knives used by Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes were 
likewise offered as exhibits. One knife was marked with "JVM-1" while 
the other knife was marked with "JVM-2."
[11]




The Version of the Defense


The defense presented the following witnesses: (1) Poquiz; (2) 
Olorfenes; (3) Joel De Asis (De Asis); and (4) Joyce Clinton Ditapat 
(Ditapat). Poquiz denied the charge of Robbery against him but instead, 
admitted that he punched Belver in the morning of September 2, 2015. 
Poquiz claimed that he was drunk at the time he punched Belver. Poquiz 
admitted that he had a quarrel with fellow tricycle driver named Omeng 
and that he punched Belver after mistakenly identifying him as companion
 of Omeng. Poquiz claimed that after punching Belver, Valencia tried to 
pacify him and he left the area and entered an alley. Upon entering the 
alley, he heard a gunshot. Poquiz claimed that he then saw Valencia was 
shot. To retaliate, Poquiz then picked up a bottle and threw it towards 
Belver, but missed. Belver then shot him on his left knee. After the 
incident, Olorfenes then brought him and Valencia to the hospital where 
they were apprehended by the two police officers. Olorfenes corroborated
 Poquiz's version of the incident.
[12]
 


De Asis testified that he was sitting on the pavement under the 
Alabang Viaduct when he saw Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes intoxicated.
 De Asis narrated that Poquiz caused a commotion after he was refused 
from borrowing the tricycle of his friend. Poquiz then punched two men: a
 jeepney driver and then Belver who had just alighted from a bus. De 
Asis claimed that Belver was being beaten up and as a defense, he drew a
 gun and fired at Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes, but Valencia blocked 
Poquiz and Valencia was hit on the foot.
[13]
 


Ditapat testified that he was biking around the area when he 
witnessed what transpired. Ditapat claimed that he saw Poquiz causing a 
commotion and was quarreling with someone then he saw Poquiz hit Belver.
 Belver then drew his gun and shot at the person in front of him. 
Ditapat claimed that he quickly fled home because he was afraid.
[14]




The Ruling of the RTC


In a Decision
[15]
 dated May
 18, 2016, the RTC, Branch 276, Muntinlupa City convicted Poquiz, 
Valencia, and Olorfenes of Robbery under Article 293 and penalized under
 Article 294(5) of the RPC. The RTC ruled that the straightforward and 
categorical testimony of Belver is relatively free from any serious 
flaw. Neither was Belver impelled by any ill motive to impute the 
commission of the crime to Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes. The RTC 
found the versions of the defense to be unbelievable, improbable and 
unconvincing as the testimonies of the defense witnesses were fraught 
with contradictions and inconsistencies which render their testimonies 
questionable.


The RTC ruled that the testimony of defense witness Ditapat supported
 and even corroborated the evidence of the prosecution. Ditapat 
bolstered the testimony of Belver that the latter was attacked and 
repeatedly mauled while on the ground and that he fired at the attackers
 after being mauled. The RTC held that the prosecution's evidence 
supports a conviction for robbery with slight physical injuries. The 
violence committed and physical injuries sustained by Belver was 
unquestionably present The crime of Robbery occurred because there was a
 severance of the goods from the possession of the owner even for an 
instant.


The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision provides: 


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Court finds 
accused RUEL POQUIZ y Orcine, REY VALENCIA y Galutan and KIM OLORFENES y
 Nudalo GUILTY of the crime of Robbery under Article 293 and penalized 
under Article 294 (5) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and hereby 
sentences them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of two (2) years and 
four (4) months of 
prision correccional
 minimum, as minimum, to six (6) years and I day of 
prision mayor
 minimum, as maximum.

No civil liability is imposed as the items subject of the crime were recovered.



SO ORDERED.
[16]




The Ruling of the CA


In a Decision
[17]
 dated 
November 27, 2017, the CA affirmed the Decision of the RTC in convicting
 Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes of Robbery under Article 293 of the 
RPC. The CA ruled that Poquiz and Valencia, with intent to gain 
unlawfully, took Belver's bag when he alighted from the bus. To 
perpetrate the robbery, Poquiz, Valencia, and Olorfenes used violence, 
particularly they threw punches and lunged a knife on Belver. The CA 
held that, in cases of robbery, taking is considered complete from the 
moment the offender gains possession of the thing, even if he has no 
opportunity to dispose of the same. Consequently, actual gain is 
irrelevant as the important consideration is the intent to gain.


 The CA sustained the finding of the RTC that there were no 
inconsistencies in Belver's testimony. The CA ruled that the RTC has the
 best opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness and that in the
 absence of any showing that the RTC plainly overlooked certain facts of
 substance, there is no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC.


 The dispositive portion of the CA Decision provides: 




WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated 18 May 2016 of the RTC is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS:



Accused-appellants RUEL POQUIZ y ORCINE and REY VALENCIA y Galutan 
are hereby declared GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
Robbery under Article 293 and penalized under Article 294 (5) of the 
Revised Penal Code (RPC) and are hereby sentenced to suffer the prison 
term ranging from 4 YEARS AND 2 MONTHS of prision correccional medium, 
as minimum, to 10 YEARS prision mayor medium, as maximum.



SO ORDERED.
[18]




In a Resolution
[19]
 dated 
April 12, 2018, the CA denied Poquiz and Valencia's Motion for 
Reconsideration. Poquiz and Valencia filed a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 before the Court.


The Issue


The issue for resolution is whether Poquiz and Valencia are guilty of the crime charged. 


The Ruling of the Court


Article 293 of the RPC states:


ART. 293. 
Who are Guilty of Robbery
.- Any person who,
 with intent to gain, shall take any personal property belonging to 
another, by means of violence or intimidation of any person, or using 
force upon anything, shall be guilty of robbery.


To warrant a conviction of the crime of Robbery, the following 
elements must concur: 1) there is a taking of personal property; 2) the 
personal property belongs to another; 3) the taking is with 
animus lucrandi
 or intent to gain; and 4) the taking is with violence against or intimidation of persons or with force upon things.
[20]
 In their Petition, Poquiz and Valencia argue that the third element of 
animus lucrandi

 is absent because there was no actual taking since Belver was never 
totally dispossessed of his possessions. Poquiz and Valencia contend 
that without unlawful taking, their 
animus lucrandi
 or intent to gain cannot be concluded.


We disagree. 


In 
Consulta v. People
,
[21]
 the Court held that 
animus lucrandi

 or intent to gain is an internal act which can be established through 
the overt acts of the offender. The offender's intent to gain may be 
presumed from the forcible taking of useful property pertaining to 
another, unless special circumstances reveal a different intent on the 
part of the perpetrator.
[22]
 In 
People v. Hernandez
,
[23]

 the Court held that, in cases of Robbery, the crime is considered 
complete from the moment the offender gains possession of the thing even
 if he has no opportunity to dispose of the same, to wit: 


In robbery, there must be an unlawful taking or 
apoderamiento which is defined as the taking of items without the 
consent of the owner, or by means of violence against or intimidation of
 persons, or by using force upon things. 
Taking is considered 
complete from the moment the offender gains possession of the thing, 
even if he has no opportunity to dispose of the same
. There is, 
likewise, no need to prove the exact amount of money taken, as long as 
there is proof of the unlawful taking. Intent to gain, or animus 
lucrandi, as an element of the crime of robbery, is an internal act; 
hence, presumed from the unlawful taking of things.
[24]
 (Emphasis supplied)


A careful review of the records and the testimony of Belver shows 
that Belver's bag was already forcibly taken and Belver was dispossessed
 of the same when Poquiz and Valencia left the scene of the crime. 
Poquiz and Valencia fled in fear and dropped the bag after Belver fired 
his gun. When Poquiz and Valencia unlawfully took Belver's bag, the 
crime of Robbery had been fully consummated. It is of no moment that 
Belver was able to subsequently recover the items forcibly taken from 
him. Such instance does not preclude the presence of intent to gain on 
the part of Poquiz and Valencia.


 Hence, all the aforementioned elements of Robbery under Article 293 
of the RPC are present: (1) the subject property involved is one of the 
bags which Belver had with him when he alighted from the bus; (2) Poquiz
 and Valencia unlawfully took the bag from Belver; (3) there was 
animus lucrandi

 or intent to gain on the part of Poquiz and Valencia in taking Belver's
 bag; and (4) Poquiz and Valencia used violence by throwing punches and 
lunging a knife on Belver to perpetrate the crime. Accordingly, the 
crime of Robbery was committed by Poquiz and Valencia.


The Court sustains the fmding of theCA that Belver's testimony was 
positive and credible. There are no inconsistencies in the testimony of 
Belver. The Court also upholds the fmding of the RTC that Belver's 
testimony was delivered in a straightforward and categorical marmer, 
free from any serious flaw. In 
People v. Eling
,
[25]

 the Court held that the finding of the trial court on the matter of 
credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest degree of respect 
and are entitled to great weight, to wit: 


The trial court has the best opportunity to observe the 
demeanor of witnesses while on the stand, it can discern whether or not 
they are telling the truth. The unbending jurisprudence is that its 
findings on the matter of credibility of witnesses are entitled to the 
highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal. It is 
well to remind appellant that when the trial court's findings have been 
affirmed by the Court of Appeals, as in the case at bar, these are 
generally binding and conclusive upon this Court. The jurisprudential 
doctrine that great weight is accorded to the factual findings of the 
trial court particularly on the ascertainment of the credibility of 
witnesses can only be discarded or disturbed when it appears in the 
record that the trial court overlooked, ignored or disregarded some fact
 or circumstance of weight or significance which if considered would 
have altered the result.
[26]


The Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of both the 
CA and the trial court. There is no showing that the CA and the RTC 
plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if 
considered, might affect the result of the case. Neither is there 
showing that the assessment of the RTC of Belver's testimony and the 
prosecution's evidence was arbitrary. Hence, Poquiz and Valencia's 
conviction for the crime of Robbery under Article 293 of the RPC must 
necessarily stand.
