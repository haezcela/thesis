HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL, PETITIONER, VS. DAISY B. PANGA-VEGA, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




LOPEZ, M., J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated April 29, 2016 and Resolution
[3]
 dated November 8, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 128947. 


ANTECEDENTS


On February 2, 2011, Atty. Daisy B. Panga-Vega (Panga-Vega), then 
Secretary of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), 
requested authority to avail of the 15 days of special leave benefit 
under Republic Act (RA) No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of 
Women," on February 7-11, 14-18, and 21-25, 2011, but not to exceed two 
months, to undergo hysterectomy.
[4]
 


On February 3, 2011, the HRET approved Panga-Vega's request for 
special leave for a period not exceeding two months starting February 7,
 2011.
[5]
 On February 7, 2011, she underwent total hysterectomy.
[6]
 


On March 7, 2011, after a month of availing of the special leave, 
PangaÂ­ Vega infonned the HRET Chairperson that she was reassuming her 
duties and functions.
[7]
 She also presented a medical certificate
[8]

 dated March 5, 2011, stating that there was "no contraindication to 
resume light to moderate activities." On March 9, 2011, she explained 
that the earlier medical certificate did not necessarily indicate her 
fitness to report for work.
[9]
 Thus, she presented another medical certificate
[10]
 of even date stating that she was already "fit to work" after her physical examination on March 6, 2011.




On March 10, 2011, the HRET directed Panga-Vega to consume her 
2-month special leave given her need for prolonged rest following her 
hysterectomy, and in view of a pending investigation on her alleged 
alteration or tampering one minutes of the meeting that could subject 
her to more stress.
[11]
 On March 14, 2011, she sought reconsideration of this HRET Reso1ution.
[12]

 On March 24, 2011, the HRET denied reconsideration reiterating her need
 to rest, and also, pointing out the confusion and doubts regarding her 
true medical condition as caused by her medical certificates.
[13]

 On April 13, 2011, Panga-Vega filed an appeal with the Civil Service 
Commission (CSC) assailing the March 10, 2011 and March 24, 2011 HRET 
Resolutions.
[14]


On October 9, 2012, the CSC issued a Decision
[15]

 granting the appeal of Panga-Vega. It ruled that she only needed to 
present a medical certificate attesting her physical fitness to return 
to work and need not exhaust the full leave she applied for under RA No.
 9710.It was further held that applying the rules on maternity leave, 
she is entitled to both the commuted money value of the unexpired 
portion of the special leave and her salary for actual services rendered
 effective the day she reported back for work. On November 23, 2012, the
 HRET sought reconsideration,
[16]
 but the CSC denied this in its Resolution
[17]
 dated February 12, 2013.


On March 19, 2013, the HRET filed a Petition for Review
[18]
 assailing the foregoing Decision and Resolution of the CSC with the CA. On April 29, 2016, the CA dismissed the petition.
[19]

 Adopting the CSC's findings, it ruled Panga-Vega may opt not to consume
 the full leave she applied for upon her submission of the medical 
certificate. It also held that nothing in RA No. 9710 precludes the 
suppletory application of the rules on maternity leave to the special 
leave benefit under RA No. 9710. The HRET sought reconsideration, but 
the CA denied this in its Resolution
[20]
 dated November 8, 2016. Hence, this petition.
[21]


 The HRET argues that the CSC should not have applied suppletorily 
the rules on maternity leave to the special leave benefit under RA No. 
9710. It also contends that Panga-Vega did not sufficiently comply with 
the "CSC Guidelines on the Availment of the Special Leave Benefits for 
Women Under RA No. 9710"
[22]
 (CSC Guidelines), warranting her return to work.


Panga-Vega counters that the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the 
HRET was not authorized to file the instant petition. She further claims
 that the suppletory application of the rules on maternity leave to the 
special leave benefit is more in accord with the thrust and intent of RA
 No. 9710. As to her compliance with the CSC Guidelines, she maintains 
that her medical certificate and her attending physician's subsequent 
clarifications sufficiently showed her fitness to return to work.
[23]




THE COURT'S RULING


Before delving into the merits, the issue raised by Panga-Vega 
regarding the authority of the HRET to initiate the case before the 
Court must first be addressed. She argues that as an agency or 
instrumentality of the Government, the statutory counsel of HRET is the 
Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). She opined that the instant 
petition should have been filed by the OSG, not by the Secretary or 
Deputy Secretary of the HRET.



 The HRET was created by virtue of Section (Sec.) 17, Article VI of 
the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which provides that the House of 
Representatives shall have its own Electoral Tribunal that shall be the 
sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and 
qualifications of its Members. As a recognized instrumentality of the 
Government, the Court, in a catena of cases, exercised over it its 
expanded judicial power to include the determination of "whether or not 
there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess 
of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the 
Government."
[24]


Meanwhile, the OSG was constituted as the law office of the 
Government and shall discharge duties requiring the services of a lawyer
 as such. It shall represent the Government of the Philippines, its 
agencies, instrumentalities, and its officials and agents in any 
litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services 
of a lawyer. It is tasked to represent the Government and its officers 
in the Court, the CA, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil 
actions and special proceedings in which the Government, or any officer 
thereof, in his official capacity is a party, among others.
[25]
 


The OSG, however, may be excused from representing the Government, 
its agencies, and instrumentalities when there is an express 
authorization by the OSG, naming therein the legal officers who are 
being deputized in cases involving their respective offices, subject to 
its supervision and control, or when the OSG takes a position different 
from that of the agency it is duty bound to represent.
[26]
 


A perusal of the records shows that there was no express 
authorization by the OSG naming the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of 
the HRET as its deputized legal officers in filing this petition. There 
was also no proof, let alone an allegation, that the OSG took a position
 different from the HRET in this case. Instead of providing a plausible 
justification why the OSG did not represent it, the HRET simply reasoned
 that the instant petition should be
given course in the interest of a speedy determination of issues. It 
even posited that the defect in its filing of the instant petition may 
be cured upon a subsequent filing by the OSG of a manifestation and 
motion ratifying and adopting it, but there had been no such 
manifestation and motion in this case. These facts necessarily evince 
that HRET lacked the legal capacity to initiate this case, and the HRET 
gave no compelling reason for the Court to disregard this finding.


Even on the merits, however, the petition must still fail.


 Section 18 of RA No. 9710 entitles a woman, who has rendered a 
continuous aggregate employment service of at least six months for the 
last 12 months, a special leave of two months with full pay based on her
 gross monthly compensation following surgery caused by gynecological 
disorders. In relation to this provision, the case involving Panga-Vega 
gives rise to the issue of whether the rules on maternity leave under 
Sec. 14, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive 
Order No. 292, which provides that the commuted money value of the 
unexpired portion of the special leave need not be refunded, and that 
when the employee returns to work before the expiration of her special 
leave, she may receive both the benefits granted under the maternity 
leave law and the salary for actual services rendered effective the day 
she reports for work, may have a suppletory application.


The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women (CEDAW), acknowledges the need to guarantee the basic 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of women through the adoption in 
the political, social, economic, and cultural fields, of appropriate 
measures, including legislation, to ensure their full development and 
advancement.
[27]
 Consistent 
thereto, no less than the fundamental law of the land imposes on the 
State the duty to protect working women by providing safe and healthful 
working conditions, as well as facilities and opportunities to enhance 
their welfare, and enable them to realize their full potential in the 
service of the nation.
[28]


 In fulfillment of the foregoing obligation under the CEDAW, and the 
1987 Philippine Constitution to advance the rights of women, RA No. 9710
 was enacted. This law acknowledges the economic, political, and 
socioÂ­cultural realities affecting their work conditions and affirms 
their role in nation-building.
[29]

 It guarantees the availability of opportunities, services, and 
mechanisms that will allow them to actively perform their roles in the 
family, community, and society. As a social legislation, its paramount 
consideration is the empowennent of women. Thus, in case of doubt, its 
provisions must be liberally construed in favor of women as the 
beneficiaries.
[30]
 


The Court finds it just and more in accord with the spirit and intent
 of RA No. 9710 to suppletorily apply the rule on maternity leave to the
 special leave benefit. Similar to the special leave benefit under RA 
No. 9710, a maternity leave under the Omnibus Rules on Leave seeks to 
protect the health and welfare of women, specifically of working 
mothers, as its primary purpose is to afford them some measures of 
financial aid, and to grant them a period of rest and recuperation in 
connection with their pregnancies.
[31]

 The special leave benefit should be liberally interpreted to support 
the female employee so as to give her further means to afford her needs,
 may it be gynecological, physical, or psychological, for a holistic 
recuperation. The recovery period may be a trying time that she needs 
much assistance and compassion to regain her overall wellness. Nothing 
in RA No. 9710 and the CSC Guidelines bar this more humane 
interpretation of the provision on special leave benefit.


Anent Panga-Vega's return to work, while RA No. 9710 and the CSC 
Guidelines do not require that the entire special leave applied for be 
consumed, certain conditions must be satisfied for its propriety.


 Under the CSC Guidelines, a total hysterectomy is classified as a major surgical procedure
[32]
 requiring a minimum period of recuperation of three weeks to a maximum period of two months.
[33]

 Aside from observing this time frame, the employee, before she can 
return to work, shall present a medical certificate signed by her 
attending surgeon that she is physically fit to assume the duties of her
 position.
[34]


 Panga-Vega underwent total hysterectomy on February 7, 2011, and 
decided to return to work on March 7, 2011. As it appears, she was 
already able to observe a period of recuperation of four weeks. As to 
the requirement for a medical certificate, it is inconsequential to 
belabor the seeming deficiency of the first medical certificate dated 
March 5, 2011, which merely stated that there was no contraindication 
for her to resume light to moderate activities, as she already presented
 a medical certificate dated March 9, 2011 signed by her attending 
obstetrician/gynecologist attesting her physical fitness to report back 
for work.


 Based on these facts on record, the CSC found that Panga-Vega 
sufficiently complied with the CSC Guidelines warranting her return to 
work. The Court accords finality to these findings acknowledging the 
CSC's special knowledge and expertise on matters falling under its 
jurisdiction as an administrative agency,
[35]
 and given the affirmance by the CA.
[36]
