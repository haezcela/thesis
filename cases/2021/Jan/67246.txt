THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 196158, January 20, 2021 ]


MAGNA READY MIX CONCRETE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. ANDERSEN BJORNSTAD KANE JACOBS, INC., RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the September 8, 2010 Decision
[2]
 and March 14, 2011 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 92647, which affirmed with modifications the August 19, 2008 Decision
[4]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 161 of Pasig City in Civil Case No. 69953.

 The CA ordered petitioner Magna Ready Mix Concrete Corporation 
(MAGNA) to pay respondent Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs, Inc. 
(ANDERSEN) the amounts of US$60,786.59,
[5]
 plus 12% legal interest computed from the time of extrajudicial demand on June 26, 1998
[6]
 until full payment, as well as P30,000.00 as exemplary damages and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees.


 
The Factual Antecedents:
 


This case stemmed from a complaint for collection of a sum of money 
and damages filed on April 20, 2004 by ANDERSEN against MAGNA.


 MAGNA is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines.
[7]
 ANDERSEN is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Washington, United States of America.
[8]

 In its Complaint, ANDERSEN alleged that it was neither doing business 
in the Philippines nor licensed to do business herein; it is suing on an
 isolated transaction that it entered into with MAGNA.
[9]
 


In 1996, MAGNA ordered from ANDERSEN the form design and drawing 
development for its project on the development of a precast plant and 
PIC double tee design.
[10]
 In 
this connection, MAGNA issued a purchase order dated October 21, 1996; 
the parties also allegedly executed an Agreement for Professional 
Services
[11]
 dated November 29, 1996
[12]
 which provided that MAGNA would compensate ANDERSEN for the performance of services described therein.
[13]
 In February 1997, MAGNA asked ANDERSEN to prepare a preliminary design for its Ecocentrum Garage Project.
[14]
 Pursuant to the contract, ANDERSEN delivered the designs.
[15]


 MAGNA made partial payments, but left an unpaid balance in the 
amount of US$60,786.59 pertaining to: (a) precast plant inspection and 
consultation; (b) PIC double tee form design and plant development 
design; and, (c) Ecocentrum Garage preliminary design for bidding.
[16]
 


ANDERSEN made repeated demands for MAGNA to pay, but to no avail; hence the filing of the complaint.
[17]

 ANDERSEN claimed that MAGNA acted "maliciously, fraudulently, and in 
gross and evident bad faith" in refusing to pay the balance.
[18]
 ANDERSEN also sought payment of interest, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
[19]


 In its defense, MAGNA claimed that ANDERSEN did not render any inspection or consultation services for it.
[20]

 It averred that ANDERSEN's claims had no basis because the contract 
upon which they were based was executed after the services had been 
performed.
[21]
 MAGNA further 
stated that it could not be liable for the PIC double tee design and 
plant development design because these were not delivered.
[22]
 The Ecocentrum Garage preliminary design was also not delivered.
[23]
 MAGNA sought moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees in its compulsory counterclaim.
[24]
 


Gene Lim (Lim), MAGNA's general manager, testified that the services 
ANDERSEN allegedly rendered were not for MAGNA's benefit, but were for 
business development, due diligence, and feasibility studies undertaken 
for the creation of Structural Pre-cast Inc. (SPI).
[25]

 SPI was allegedly a corporation that Bharat Soli (Soli), ANDERSEN's 
principal owner, and Lim had planned to incorporate for their business 
venture.
[26]
 However, SPI was not formally incorporated due to the Asian Financial Crisis.
[27]


 During the trial, MAGNA filed a 
Motion to Dismiss with Motion to Cancel Hearing
[28]

 claiming that it later discovered (after filing its answer) that 
ANDERSEN previously filed a case against another Philippine corporation.
[29]

 In that earlier case, ANDERSEN sought to collect a sum of money from 
the defendant for the design and development of the latter's projects.
[30]

 MAGNA claimed that the earlier case covered several transactions 
different from the subject of the instant case but involved the same 
Ecocentrum design drawing.
[31]

 Due to this discovery, MAGNA asserted that ANDERSEN was indeed doing 
business in the Philippines but without the necessary license. Hence, it
 filed the motion to dismiss alleging that ANDERSEN has no legal 
capacity to sue.


The RTC, in its Order dated March 19, 2007, denied MAGNA's motion to 
dismiss on the ground that it was already estopped from challenging 
ANDERSEN's personality after having acknowledged the same by virtue of 
its entering into a contract with it.
[32]
 Trial then continued. 


Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:
 


It its August 19, 2008 Decision, the RTC ruled in favor of ANDERSEN. 
However, it did not grant the complete relief of payment of US$60,786.59
 which ANDERSEN prayed for but only USD35,694.03 with legal interest, 
P50,000.00 as attorney's fees, and costs of suit.
[33]

 In arriving at the amount of US$35,694.03, the RTC deducted the 
purported equity participation of Soli and a certain Jun Pelaez (Pelaez)
 in SPI.
[34]


 The RTC ruled that ANDERSEN was able to establish by preponderance 
of evidence that a contract (Agreement for Professional Services) indeed
 existed between the parties.
[35]

 The trial court also found that there was a series of exchanges of 
memoranda and notes between the parties showing that MAGNA instructed 
ANDERSEN to work on the design of the precast manufacturing even prior 
to the signing of the contract. The former was therefore liable for the 
services that the latter rendered even prior to the execution ofthe 
contract.
[36]
 


The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads: 


WHEREFORE
, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of 
the plaintiff Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs, Inc. and against defendant
 Magna Ready Mix Concrete Corporation [which] is directed to pay 
plaintiff the following:


The amount of $35,694.03 computed at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the time of the consummated contract on November 29, 1996 
with 12% legal interest per annum computed from the time of the filing 
of the complaint until fully paid.



The amount of P50,000 as attorney'S fees and litigation expenses.



The costs of suit.


SO ORDERED
.
[37]




Dissatisfied, both parties appealed the case to the CA.


 ANDERSEN contended that the RTC erred in: (a) finding that MAGNA is 
liable only in the amount of US$35,694.03 out of the US$60,786.59 prayed
 for; (b) holding that the legal interest shall be computed from the 
time of filing the complaint and not from the time when written demand 
was made on June 24, 1998; (c) not awarding exemplary damages; and, (d) 
awarding only P50,000.00 as attorney's fees considering that the legal 
fees it incurred far exceeds that amount.
[38]


 On the other hand, MAGNA contended that the RTC erred in: (a) not 
dismissing the complaint despite ANDERSEN's concealment of the fact that
 it is a foreign corporation doing business in the Philippines without a
 license, and filing a suit not based on an isolated transaction; (b) 
ruling that there was a consummated contract between the parties; and 
(c) holding MAGNA liable for the services ANDERSEN rendered prior to the
 date of the supposed contract; and, (d) holding that MAGNA was liable 
for the services ANDERSEN rendered regarding the precast double tee form
 design, plant development design, and Ecocentrum Garage preliminary 
design as these were not delivered to MAGNA as agreed.
[39]




Ruling of the Court of Appeals:


 In its assailed September 8, 2010 Decision, the CA partially granted
 ANDERSEN'S appeal and dismissed MAGNA's. It affirmed the RTC Decision 
with modification by ordering MAGNA to pay the complete relief ANDERSEN 
prayed for in the amount of US$60,786.59, subject to 12% legal interest 
from time of extrajudicial demand on June 26, 1998 until full payment.
[40]
 It also ordered MAGNA to pay exemplary damages and attorney's fees.
[41]


The CA ruled that ANDERSEN's filing of another case against another 
domestic corporation covering transactions different from the subject of
 the instant case does not necessarily prove that it is doing business 
in the Philippines without the requisite license.
[42]

 As the subject matter or transaction in the earlier case is not related
 nor relevant to the subject of the instant case, the latter is still 
deemed isolated.
[43]
 Further, the CA held that MAGNA has already waived its right to contest ANDERSEN's legal capacity to sue.
[44]

 Prior to filing of the motion to dismiss, MAGNA had already filed an 
answer and participated in the proceedings without assailing ANDERSEN's 
legal capacity to sue.
[45]
 The
 defense of plaintiffs lack of legal capacity to sue is not deemed 
waived even if not raised in a motion to dismiss or answer as provided 
in the Rules of Court and jurisprudence.
[46]
 


The CA ruled that there was a perfected and binding contract between the parties;
[47]

 and that MAGNA is estopped from disclaiming the existence of the 
contract in view of its stipulation during the pre-trial that it 
executed the said contract with ANDERSEN, which constitutes a judicial 
admission.
[48]
 Also, Lim himself admitted in his testimony that he signed the said contract.
[49]

 Further, the CA sustained the RTC's finding that even prior to the 
execution of the contract, MAGNA was already obtaining consultation 
services from ANDERSEN, making the former liable for the latter's 
services rendered prior to the contract.
[50]

 With regard to MAGNA's contentions that the various designs and 
drawings were not delivered, the CA ruled that the evidence (in the form
 of letters, purchase orders, and correspondences) adequately showed 
that MAGNA, through Lim, sought ANDERSEN'S services and the latter 
indeed performed the services required of it.
[51]
 


In awarding the whole amount of US$60,786.59, theCA found that the 
amount the RTC deducted pertaining to the equity participation of Soli 
and Pelaez in SPI were conditioned on the shares of stock to be issued 
by SPI.
[52]
 However, as SPI was not formally incorporated, MAGNA therefore remained liable for the amount previously deducted.
[53]
 There was no showing of a new agreement nor a valid novation of the contract transferring the liability to Soli and Pelaez.
[54]


 The CA reckoned the imposition of legal interest from the time a written demand was made on June 26, 1998.
[55]

 On the award of exemplary damages, it ruled that MAGNA's utter 
disregard of its contractual obligations to ANDERSEN evinced wanton, 
reckless, and malevolent conduct.
[56]
 Lastly, the CA found no cogent reason to warrant the increase of attorney's fees as awarded by the RTC.
[57]


The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads: 


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the appeal of plaintiff-appellant (Andersen) is 
PARTIALLY GRANTED
,
 while the appeal of defendantÂ­ appellant (Magna) is DISMISSED. The 
decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 161 dated 19 
August 2008, is 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATIONS
.
 Defendant-appellant is ordered to pay plaintiff-appeallant the amount 
of $60,786.59 computed at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of 
the subject contract on 29 November 1996, plus 12% legal interest per 
annum computed from the time of the extrajudicial demand on June 26, 199
[8]

 until full payment. It is further directed to pay plaintiff-appellant 
exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00 and attorney's fees in the
 amount of 50,000.00. 


SO ORDERED
.
[58]




MAGNA moved for a reconsideration but it was subsequently denied by the appellate court in its March 14, 2011 Resolution.
[59]
 


Hence, this Petition. 


Issue


The sole issue for the resolution of the Court is whether ANDERSEN has legal capacity to sue in the Philippines. 


Our Ruling


Well-established is the rule that only questions of law should be raised in a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.  This Court is generally not a trier of facts. This rule admits of exceptions
[60]
 but the instant case does not fall under any of these. This Court has repeatedly stated that:


A question of law exists when the doubt centers on what the 
law is on a certain set of facts while a question of fact results when 
the issue revolves around the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For
 a question to be one of law, the question must not involve an 
examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by any of 
the litigants. The resolution of the issue must solely depend on what 
the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is obvious 
that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question 
posed is one offact.
[61]


Except for the issue concerning ANDERSEN's legal capacity to sue, the
 Petition raises questions of facts already ruled upon by the RTC and 
affirmed by the CA.


 The Court resolves that ANDERSEN has no legal capacity to sue for 
doing business in the Philippines without procuring the necessary 
license. It is not suing on an isolated transaction on the basis of the 
contract it entered into with MAGNA. However, MAGNA is already estopped 
from challenging ANDERSEN's legal capacity when it entered into a 
contract with it.


Section 133 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines (1980)
[62]
 provides: 


Section 133. 
Doing Business Without License
. -No 
foreign corporation transacting business in the Philippines without a 
license, or its successors or assigns, shall be permitted to maintain or
 intervene in any action, suit or proceeding in any court or 
administrative agency of the Philippines; but such corporation may be 
sued or proceeded against before Philippine courts or administrative 
tribunals on any valid cause of action recognized under Philippine laws.


Thus, a foreign corporation that conducts business in the Philippines
 must first secure a license for it to be allowed to initiate or 
intervene in any action in any court or administrative agency in the 
Philippines. A corporation has legal status only in the state that 
granted it personality.
[63]
 
Hence, a foreign corporation has no personality in the Philippines, much
 less legal capacity to file a case, unless it procures a license as 
provided by law.
[64]
 


The case of 
Agilent Technologies v. Integrated Silicon
,
[65]
 citing 
Mentholatum v. Mangaliman
,
[66]
 discusses the two tests to determine whether a foreign corporation is doing business in the Philippines: 


In 
Mentholatum
, this Court discoursed on the two 
general tests to determine whether or not a foreign corporation can be 
considered as "doing business" in the Philippines. The first of these is
 the substance test, thus:


The true test [for doing business], however, seems to be 
whether the foreign corporation is continuing the body of the business 
or enterprise for which it was organized or whether it has substantially
 retired from it and turned it over to another.


The second test is the continuity test, expressed thus:


The term [doing business] implies a continuity of commercial
 dealings and arrangements, and contemplates, to that extent, the 
performance of acts or works or the exercise of some of the functions 
normally incident to, and in the progressive prosecution of, the purpose
 and object of its organization.
[67]




The number of the transactions entered into is not determinative 
whether a foreign corporation is doing business in the Philippines; the 
intention to continue the body of its business prevails.
[68]
 The number or quantity is merely an evidence of such intention.
[69]

 A single act or transaction may then be considered as doing business 
when a corporation performs acts for which it was created or exercises 
some of the functions for which it was organized.
[70]
 


As an exception, a foreign corporation may sue without a license on the basis of an isolated transaction. 
Eriks Pte. Ltd. v. Court of Appeals
[71]
 describes the concept of isolated transaction, to wit: 


The phrase "isolated transaction" has a definite and fixed 
meaning, i.e. a transaction or series of transactions set apart from the
 common business of a foreign enterprise in the sense that there is no 
intention to engage in a progressive pursuit of the purpose and object 
of the business organization. Whether a foreign corporation is "doing 
business" does not necessarily depend upon the frequency of its 
transactions, but more upon the nature and character of the 
transactions.
[72]


Based on the foregoing, a single act may be considered as either 
doing business or an isolated transaction depending on its nature. It 
may be considered as doing business if it implies a continuity of 
commercial dealings and contemplates the performance of acts or the 
exercise of functions normally incidental to and in the progressive 
pursuit of its purpose. Contrarily, it may be considered as an isolated 
transaction if it is different from or not related to the common 
business of the foreign corporation in the sense that there is no 
objective to increasingly pursue its purpose or object. And as stated, a
 license is not required if the foreign corporation is suing on an 
isolated transaction.


 Here, ANDERSEN alleged in its Complaint that it was suing on an 
isolated transaction based on its contract with MAGNA but admitting at 
the same time that it did not have a license to do business in the 
Philippines. The CA ruled that ANDERSEN was indeed suing on an isolated 
transaction.


This Court does not agree with theCA's finding in this regard.


ANDERSEN's act of entering into a contract with MAGNA does not fall 
into the category of isolated transactions. The contract clearly shows 
that ANDERSEN was to render professional services to MAGNA for a fee. 
These professional services included the following: (1) providing master
 plant site layout and plant design; (2) providing plant operation 
procedures and organization matrix; (3) providing plant management and 
production staff training; (4) providing plant construction and 
operation start-up services; and (5) providing consultation services for
 developing a precast plant program.
[73]

 It is clear then that ANDERSEN, in entering into that contract with 
MAGNA, was performing acts that were in progressive pursuit of its 
business purpose, which, as found by the RTC, involved consultation and 
design services.
[74]
 


Though it was a single transaction, ANDERSEN's act of entering into a
 contract with MAGNA constitutes doing business in the Philippines. It 
cannot be considered as an isolated transaction because the act is 
related to ANDERSEN's specific business purpose. Thus, in doing business
 without a license, ANDERSEN had no legal capacity to sue in the 
Philippines.


 However, the Court agrees that MAGNA is already estopped from 
challenging ANDERSEN's legal capacity to sue. The doctrine of estoppel 
states that the other contracting party may no longer challenge the 
foreign corporation's personality after acknowledging the same by 
entering into a contract with it.
[75]

 This principle is applied in order to "prevent a person (or another 
corporation) contracting with a foreign corporation from later taking 
advantage of its noncompliance with the statutes, chiefly in cases where
 such person has received the benefits of the contract."
[76]
 The case of 
Communications Materials and Design, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
[77]
 elaborates on the doctrine: 


A foreign corporation doing business in the Philippines 
may sue in Philippine Courts although not authorized to do business here
 against a Philippine citizen or entity who had contracted with and 
benefited by said corporation. To put it in another way, a party is 
estopped to challenge the personality of a corporation after having 
acknowledged the same by entering into a contract with it. And the 
doctrine of estoppel to deny corporate existence applies to a foreign as
 well as to domestic corporations. One who has dealt with a corporation 
of foreign origin as a corporate entity is estopped to deny its 
corporate existence and capacity. The principle will be applied to 
prevent a person contracting with a foreign corporation from later 
taking advantage of its noncompliance with the statutes chiefly in cases
 where such person has received the benefits of the contract.



The rule is deeply rooted in the time-honored axiom of 
commodum ex injuria sua non habere debet 
-no
 person ought to derive any advantage of his own wrong. This is as it 
should be for as mandated by law, "every person must in the exercise of 
his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give 
everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith." 


x x x x
[78]


By virtue of the doctrine of estoppel, a party cannot take undue 
advantage by challenging the foreign corporation's personality or legal 
capacity to sue when the former already acknowledged the same by 
entering into a contract with the latter and derived benefits therefrom.


 In this case, MAGNA is already estopped from challenging ANDERSEN's 
legal capacity to sue due to its prior dealing with the latter, that is,
 entering into a contract with it. As ruled by the courts below, there 
was a perfected and binding contract between the parties. By such 
contract, MAGNA effectively acknowledged ANDERSEN's personality. MAGNA's
 allegation that it only discovered during the trial that ANDERSEN was 
doing business in the Philippines without a license, is therefore 
irrelevant. Moreover, MAGNA had already benefited from the contract 
because as found by the lower and appellate courts, ANDERSEN indeed 
rendered services to MAGNA pursuant to their contract and even prior 
thereto.


Finally, the Court modifies the legal interest imposed by the CA. The appellate court applied the earlier case of 
Eastern Shipping Lines v. Court of Appeals
[79]
 in imposing 12% legal interest per 
annum

 reckoned from the date of extrajudicial demand on June 26, 1998 until 
full payment. Subsequently, as the Court discussed and applied in 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
,
[80]

 Resolution No. 796 issued by the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas which took effect on July 1, 2013, lowered the interest 
rate from 12% to 6% per annum for loans or forbearance of money, goods, 
and credit, in the absence of an express stipulation.
[81]

 Therefore, the interest on the amount due must be bifurcated, and is to
 be imposed as follows: (a) interest at the rate of 12% per 
annum

 is to be computed on the amount due from June 26, 1998, the date of 
extrajudicial demand, until June 30, 2013; and subsequently, (b) 
interest at the rate of 6% per 
annum
 is to be computed on the amount due from July 1, 2013 until full payment thereof.
[82]


WHEREFORE
, the Petition is 
DENIED
. The September 8, 2010 Decision and March 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 92647 are 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
 in that the amount of US$60,786.59 shall bear legal interest as follows: (a) 12% per

annum
 from July 1, 2013 until full payment thereof. Costs on petitioner.
