The Factual Antecedents:


An Information
[5]
 dated June 
1, 2005 was filed before the RTC of Pili, Camarines Sur against 
petitioner Pante and his two minor co-accused, charging them with the 
crime of Theft under Article 308, par. 2, subparagraph (1) of the 
Revised Penal Code (RPC) as follows:


That [sometime] on December 11, 2004, in barangay Palestina,
 Pili, Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the 
Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring, confederating and helping
 one another, without the consent of the owner, nor force, violence or 
intimidation, after having found the amount of US$4,550.00 or 
(P254,800.00) and P27,000.00, belonging to Dawson D. Word, and without 
delivering the same to its owner or authority, and once in possession of
 said amount, with intent to gain, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously, convert the said amount for their own 
personal use and benefits, to the damage and prejudice of Dawson D. 
Word.


ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.
[6]


Upon arraignment, Pante and his two co-accused entered separate pleas of "not guilty."
Version of the Prosecution:


On December 10, 2004, Dawson Word (Word) dropped by the People's Mart in
 Naga City, Camarines Sur with his househelper, Angie BeroÃ±o (BeroÃ±o), 
to buy fish. He was carrying US$4,550.00 and P27,000.00 bundled together
 in a rubber band placed on his lap. Word gave BeroÃ±o P1,000.00 to buy 
fish and arranged his remaining money while waiting inside the car. When
 BeroÃ±o returned, Word placed the bundle of money on his lap between his
 legs and drove back to his apartment.
[7]
 He parked his car in front of his residence and forgot the money that he placed on his lap.
[8]

 Apparently, upon alighting from the car, the bundled money fell on the 
road near his vehicle.
At about 5:30 a.m. the following morning, a bakery worker noticed a 
bundle of money lying on the ground near Word's car. Meanwhile, one of 
Pante's co-accused, who was riding his bike outside, also noticed the 
bundle of money and picked it up before going inside his house.
[9]
 
At around 8:00 a.m., Word realized that the money that he had placed on his lap was missing.
[10]

 He began searching for it in his car but could no longer find it. With 
the help of his landlord, Word learned that Pante's minor co-accused 
picked up the bundled money near his car.
[11]
 
On December 21, 2004, Word sought the help of the police in the recovery
 of his money. Upon investigation, it was found that Pante's minor 
co-accused was indeed the finder of the money. The police headed to the 
minor's residence where accused-minor admitted that he found the bundle 
of money under Word's car.
[12]

 He also averred that the money was shared among his other co-accused, 
who is a cousin and also a minor, Pante, and himself. His parents 
returned the US$1,300.00 to Word, as evidenced by the receipt
[13]
signed
 by his father.
On the same day, the police went to the house of the other accused- 
minor, who admitted getting US$500.00 but could no longer return the 
same because he already spent it.
[14]

 Thereafter, the police proceeded to the house of Pante, who also 
admitted that he received US$1,700.00. He was able to return US$300.00, 
P4,660.00, one unit of JVC component, and a gas stove with a tank. Pante
 also gave a receipt
[15]
 from 
Monton Hardware, where he bought construction materials. Seeing that 
some of the materials were already used, the police did not retrieve 
them anymore. Thereafter, all the money and items recovered from the 
three accused were returned to Word.
Version of the Defense:


The accused-minor testified that while riding his bike in the morning of
 December 11, 2004, he found 30 pieces of US$100 bills near Word's car, 
but no Philippine currency. The accused-minor testified that while riding his bike in the morning of
 December 11, 2004, he found 30 pieces of US$100 bills near Word's car, 
but no Philippine currency.
[16]

 He kept the money in his pocket and proceeded to deliver bread. 
Afterwards, he went to his co-accused cousin to ask him what to do with 
the money. While they were talking, Pante overheard their conversation. 
Being the only adult among them, Pante told them to get the money and 
proceed to the tree house. On their way to the tree house, Pante grabbed
 the money and counted it. Thereafter, he got 17 pieces of US$100 dollar
 bills for himself. His co-accused cousin received US$500.00 while he 
kept US$2,350.00. Pante went home with his share and never returned.
[17]
 
The other accused-minor admitted that his cousin gave him US$500.00 on 
the same day Word lost his money. However, he gave it back to his cousin
 so he could return it to Word. 
On the other hand, Pante testified that on December 11, 2004 at around 
6:30 p.m., he saw his two co-accused pass by the back of the bakery 
where he was working. They were carrying items like Playstation and new 
shoes. He asked them where they got the money to buy those things and 
learned that one of them found a bundle of dollar bills. He admitted 
receiving 10 dollar bills from his co-accused as his 
"balato."
 He
 kept the money for a few days then exchanged them to Philippine 
currency. He used the money to buy a JVC component, a gas stove with a 
tank, and a CD cassette.
[18]
 
When police authorities came to his house on December 21, 2004 demanding
 return of the money, he told his wife to get the remaining US$300.00 
and P4,660.00 and turned it over to them.
[19]


Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:


In its January 23, 2013 Judgment, the RTC found all three accused guilty
 beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Theft. The evidence submitted 
by the prosecution proved that Word lost his money and that the 
accused-minor was the finder thereof, and who shared the cash he found 
with his co-accused cousin and Pante, the latter both knowing where the 
money came from. While the trial Court was convinced that Word lost 
dollar bills in the amount of US$4,450, the prosecution failed to prove 
that he also lost money in Philippine currency. It found that Pante got 
US$1,700.00, while the two accused-minor netted US$500.00 and 
US$2,350.00 each. 
The trial court noted that Pante even instructed the two minors not to 
return the money. Instead of encouraging them to return the cash, Pante 
got a portion for himself and headed home. Thus, the trial court did not
 give credence to Pante's position that he did not have any interest in 
keeping the money. Neither can his act of returning the money be 
considered voluntary since he already knew that Word was looking for his
 lost money and he only returned it upon the arrival of police 
authorities in his house.
The dispositive portion of the RTC's Judgment
[20]
 insofar as petitioner Pante is concerned, reads:


WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing judgment, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:

x x x x

3. Finding the accused 
FERNANDO PANTE, "GUILTY"
 beyond reasonable
 doubt of the crime of theft under Article 308, par. 1 of the Revised 
Penal Code and imposing the penalty of imprisonment ranging from 
2 years 4 months and 1 day of prision correctional as minimum to 9 years and 1 day of prision mayor as maximum
. He is ordered to pay the private complainant Dawson Word the sum of P59,120.00 as actual damages.


SO ORDERED.
[21]
 (Emphasis in the original)


Aggrieved, Pante appealed
[22]
 
the judgment of conviction before the CA, arguing that the prosecution 
did not prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. First, the prosecution 
did not present any proof of ownership over the money that Word had 
allegedly lost.
[23]
 Moreover, he argued that Word's knowledge of Pante's participation in the crime was based solely on his co-accused's averments
[24]

 which are only circumstantial evidence that cannot warrant his 
conviction. Lastly, Pante posited that there was no unlawful taking of 
the money on his part because the finder of the lost money was his 
co-accused and not himself. Not knowing where it came from, he averred 
that he did not have any intent to take money belonging to another.
[25]
 On the other hand, the People, through the Office of the Solicitor 
General (OSG), maintained that Pante's guilt was clearly established 
beyond reasonable doubt. No less than the petitioner himself admitted in
 open court that he knowingly received US$1,000.00 from the lost money.
On the other hand, the People, through the Office of the Solicitor 
General (OSG), maintained that Pante's guilt was clearly established 
beyond reasonable doubt. No less than the petitioner himself admitted in
 open court that he knowingly received US$1,000.00 from the lost money.
[26]
 His co-accused also testified that Pante actually took US$1,700.00 and insisted they keep the money to themselves.
[27]

In fact, Pante's act of returning the items purchased using Word's 
money, and the remaining cash amounting to US$300.00 and P4,660.00, 
support such allegations. The OSG further contended that Pante is 
considered a "finder in law" and guilty of Theft even if the original 
finder of the money was his co-accused because he failed to return the 
same despite knowledge that it was lost property.
[28]
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:


The CA, in its assailed February 6, 2015 Decision,
[29]
 affirmed the RTC's ruling. The dispositive portion thereof reads:


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby 
DENIED
.
 The Judgment dated January 23, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch
 33, Pili, Camarines Sur finding accused-appellant Fernando Pante 
y

 Rangasa guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Theft defined 
and penalized under Article 308, par. 2, subpax. (1) of the Revised 
Penal Code and to pay private complainant Dawson Word the sum of 
P59,120.00 as actual damages is 
AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION
 in that appellant is ordered to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of 2 years 4 months and 1 day of 
prision correccional
, as minimum to 13 years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum.

SO ORDERED.
[30]
 (Emphasis in the original)


Undeterred, Pante filed the instant the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[31]
 raising the following â


Issues:


(A) WHETHER THE [CA] ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE CONVICTION OF 
THE PETITIONER FOR THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE 
TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.

(B) WHETHER THE [CA] ERRED IN CONVICTING THE PETITIONER FOR THE CRIME 
CHARGED DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH THAT HE CONSPIRED
 WITH [HIS CO-ACCUSED] IN THE COMISSION OF THE CRIME OF THEFT.
[32]


Our Ruling


The Petition is unmeritorious. 
The CA correctly found that the prosecution sufficiently established 
Pante's guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Theft. Under 
Article 308, par. 2 (1) of the RPC, Theft is also committed by one's 
failure to deliver lost property to its owner or local authorities.
[33]

 In this kind of Theft, it is essential to prove: 1) the finding of lost
 property; 2) the failure of the finder to deliver the same to the local
 authorities or its owner.
[34]
 
In the case at bar, both the trial court and the appellate court found 
that the prosecution witnesses were able to prove that Word lost his 
bundled money after alighting from his car in front of his residence and
 forgetting that he had placed them in between his legs. Such fact was 
corroborated by the prosecution witness who testified that he positively
 saw the accused-minor pick up the bundle of money under Word's car.
In the same vein, all three accused admitted that it was the 
accused-minor who found the bundle of money in front of the bakery, 
which they later divided among themselves in the following manner: 
US$1,700.00 for Pante; and US$500.00 and US$2,350.00 for each of the two
 accused-minor. Despite knowing that the money did not rightfully belong
 to them, Pante encouraged the two minor accused to keep the money for 
themselves. He also appropriated the money for himself by buying various
 items such as a JVC component, gas tank, and construction materials. He
 only returned the remainder of the money to Word when police 
authorities showed up in his house.
[35]
 
Time and again, this Court has held that greater weight is given to the 
positive identification of the accused by the prosecution witness than 
the accused's denial and explanation concerning the commission of the 
crime.
[36] 
Mere denials are 
only self-serving evidence whose evidentiary weight cannot outweigh the 
declaration of credible witnesses who testified on affirmative matters.
[37]
 
In relation thereto, findings of facts of the trial court, its 
calibration of the testimonial evidence of the parties as well as its 
conclusion on its findings, are accorded high respect if not conclusive 
effect.
[38]
 This is because of
 the unique advantage of the trial court to observe, at close range, the
 conduct, demeanor and deportment of the witness as they testify. 
[39]

 This rule applies even more when such findings are affirmed by the 
appellate court. When the trial court's findings have been affirmed by 
the appellate court, said findings are generally binding upon this 
Court.
[40]
 
Anent Pante's argument that he cannot be convicted for Theft because he 
is not the finder of the lost property, we are not persuaded. The 
question of whether criminal appropriation of found property can be 
committed by a person other than the one by whom the property is first 
found has been lengthily discussed and answered in the affirmative in 
People v. Avila
,
[41]
 viz.:


From a comparison of the definitions given above it is 
obvious that the most fundamental notion in the crime of theft is taking
 of the thing to be appropriated into the physical power of the thief, 
which idea is qualified by other conditions, such as that taking must be
 effected 
animo lucrandi
 and without the consent of the owner; 
and it will be here noted that the definition does not require that the 
taking should be effected against the will of the owner but merely that 
it should be without consent, â a distinction of no slight no sight 
importance.


Upon these considerations it is evident that the taking and 
appropriation of a thing by one who finds it, knowing the same to have 
been misplaced or lost by the true owner, and with knowledge of his 
identity, is legitimately within the classical definition of theft; and giving expression to the second subsection of article 517 of
 the Penal Code the authors of the Code have merely extended the general
 definition to a special case about which otherwise some doubt might 
have existed; and we cannot impute to them the clumsy mistake of having 
imported into the law of theft a form of offense foreign to that 
conception and which should properly have been incorporated in the 
chapter dealing with 
estafa
.


What has been said is of the greatest practical importance in dealing 
the problem now in hand, for it determines the proper point of view for 
the correct interpretation of the provision relating to the theft of 
found property; namely, the provision should be interpreted according to
 its true spirit and conformably with the doctrines that inform it. If 
we had discovered that this form of theft is really a species of 
estafa

 wrenched from its proper associations and artificially placed under a 
heading where it does not belong, much could be said in favor of a 
strict and literal interpretation; but when it is made to appear that 
the criminal misappropriation of found property is theft upon general 
principles of jurisprudence and not some other crime, it becomes obvious
 that the provision in question should be applied in accordance with its
 true spirit.

What then is the meaning of the second subsection of article 517, in so 
far as it affects the case before us? The words used in the law are 
literally these: "Those are guilty of theft: ... 2. Who, finding a lost 
thing, and knowing who the owner is, appropriate it with intent to 
gain." 
The gist of this offense is the furtive taking and 
misappropriation of the property found, with knowledge of its true 
ownership; and the word "finding" (in Spanish, 
encontrandose
) 
must not be treated as a cabalistic or sacramental first finder. The 
furtive appropriation of the found property, under the conditions 
stated, is the principal thing. In the case before us, the accused if 
not the actual finder, occupied towards the purse, from the time he took
 it into his hands, precisely the same relation as if he had picked it 
up himself. The purpose of the law is to protect the owner of the lost 
thing from appropriation by the person into whose hands it may come, 
with knowledge of its ownership. The accused was a finder in law, if not
 in fact; and his act in appropriating the property was of precisely the
 same character as if it had been originally found by him.
[42]


x x x x


The same writer then passes on to a proposition more directly connected 
with the case now before us, since it relates to the act of 
misappropriation by one who receives the property by voluntary 
substitution from the actual finder. Upon this the rule there formulated
 is this: "
One who receives property from the finder thereof assumes,
 in legal contemplation, by voluntary substitution, as to the property 
and the owner, the relation occupied by the finder, placing himself in 
the finder's stead.
 In such a case, whether the person taking the 
property is guilty must be determined on the same principles that govern
 in the case of the actual finder." (17 R. C. L., 36.)

In 
Allen vs. State (91 Ala., 19) some children found a pocketbook 
containing money and certain papers sufficient to identify the owner. 
Upon arriving home, the children delivered the purse to their father, 
who converted it of his own use. It was held that the accused was 
properly convicted and that his guilt was to be determined by the same 
principles that would have government if he had been the actual finder. 
In the course of the opinion the following language was used:


"... Finding it, and its delivery to the defendant by the 
finder, did not deprive the money, as to the owner of the character 
status of lost property; the ownership remained in him, drawing to it, 
constructively, the right of possession. 
When defendant took the 
money from his children, he knew it had been lost, and took it as such. 
It is manifest the children had no felonious intent, and properly 
delivered the money to their father for his disposition. By receiving it
 from his children, knowing it was lost, defendant assumed, in legal 
contemplation, by voluntary substitution, as to the money and the owner,
 the relation occupied by the finders, placing himself in their stead.

 Otherwise a person knowingly receiving lost properly from the finder, 
who had no intent to steal, with the felonious intent to appropriate it 
to his own use, escapes punishment. In such case, whether or not the 
person taking the money principles which govern in the case of the 
actual finder."
[43]
 (Emphasis supplied)


In fine, a "finder" under Article 308, par. 2(1) of the RPC is not only limited to the actual finder of the lost property
[44]
 since the gist of the offense is the furtive taking and misappropriation of the property found 
[45]

 Though not the actual finder, there is no dispute that Pante knew for a
 fact that his two co-accused minor did not own the subject money. He 
knew for a fact that his co-accused minor merely found the money along 
the road while the latter was delivering bread.
[46]

 Instead of returning the money, Pante convinced his co-accused minors 
not to return the money and to divide it among themselves. At that 
moment, Pante placed himself precisely in the situation as if he was the
 actual finder. Otherwise stated, petitioner was a "finder in law," if 
not in fact; and his act in appropriating the money was of precisely of 
the same character as if it had been originally found by him.
[47]

 His criminal intent to commandeer the money found was altogether clear 
at that point. 
The rationale for the "finder in law" concept is not difficult to 
fathom. It is precisely to protect the owner of the lost property in the
 event the lost property is transferred from one individual to another 
and to prevent the "finder in law" from escaping liability by claiming 
that he was not the actual finder thereof but was merely entrusted 
custody thereof by someone who had no intention to appropriate the same.
 "Otherwise a person knowingly receiving lost property from the finder, 
who had no intent to steal, with the felonious intent to appropriate it 
to his [or her] own use, escapes punishment. In such case, whether or 
not the person taking the money is guilty of [theft] must be determined 
on the same principles which govern in the case of the actual finder."
[48]
 Having obtained possession of Word's lost money, Pante had the 
opportunity and the obligation to return the lost property to its 
rightful owner or to the local authorities, but he unjustifiably 
refrained from doing so. Assuming for the sake of argument that he did 
not know that the money belonged to Word, Pante would still be held 
liable for Theft for failing to return the amount. This is because the 
RPC does not require that the thief must know the owner of the lost 
property.

liable for Theft for failing to return the amount. This is because the 
RPC does not require that the thief must know the owner of the lost 
property.
[49]
 This is 
precisely why the subject penal provision gave the finder the option to 
return the lost property not only to the owner thereof but also to the 
local authorities.
[50]
 
As to the second issue, this Court notes that petitioner raised the 
issue on conspiracy for the first time on appeal. On this point, we heed
 
Rebadulla v. Republic
,
[51]
 where it was pronounced that:


It is well-settled that no question will be entertained on 
appeal unless it has been raised in the proceedings below. Points of 
law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the 
lower court, administrative agency or quasi-judicial body, need not be 
considered by a reviewing court, as they cannot be raised for the first 
time at that late stage. Basic considerations of fairness and due 
process impel this rule. Any issue raised for the first time on appeal 
is barred by estoppel.
[52]


Clearly, issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be 
entertained because to do so would be contrary to the principles of 
fairness and due process.
[53]
 
As such, we agree with the findings of the RTC and the CA in finding 
petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Theft. 
However, this Court finds it necessary to modify the penalty to be 
imposed upon petitioner pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 10951,
[54]
 which became effective during the pendency of the case.
[55]

 The Act provides that its retroactivity shall be given effect insofar 
as it is favorable to the accused or person serving sentence by final 
judgment.
[56]
 Hence, it is 
applicable to petitioner's case.
Given that the value involved in this case is P59,120.00, the penalty 
under Article 309 of the RPC, as amended by Section 81 of RA No. 10951, 
is 
prisiÃ³n correccional
 in its minimum and medium periods
[57]
 which ranges from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months.
[58]
Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the penalty shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree 
i.e.
, 
arresto mayor
 in its medium and maximum periods,
[59]

 or anywhere from two months and one day to six (6) months. Hence, 
petitioner must suffer a minimum indeterminate penalty of four months 
and 20 days of 
arresto mayor
, as minimum to two (2) years, eleven (11) months, and ten (10) days of p
rision correccional
,
 as maximum. 
Moreover, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, the amount of 
P59,120.00 shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per 
annum
 from finality of this Decision until fully paid.


WHEREFORE,
 the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 is 
DENIED

 for lack of reversible error on the part of the Court of Appeals. The 
February 6, 2015 Decision and June 9, 2015 Resolution of the Court of 
Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 36219 are hereby 
AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION

 in that petitioner Fernando Pante y Rangasa is sentenced to suffer the 
penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and twenty (20) days of 
arresto mayor
, as minimum, to two (2) years, eleven (11) months, and ten (10) days of 
prision correccional

 as maximum. He is also ordered to pay private complainant the amount of
 P59,120.00 as actual damages, with interest at the rate of six percent 
(6%) per

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION


DELOS SANTOS, 
J.
:


I concur with the 
ponencia
 ably-written by my esteemed colleague,
 Associate Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando, and submit this Opinion to 
express my thoughts and stress on some particular points.

Petitioner Fernando Pante 
y
 Rangasa (Pante) was charged with theft under Article 308, paragraph 2 (1), of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), which provides:


Article 308. Who are liable for theft. x x x

Theft is likewise committed by:


Any person who, having found lost property, shall fail to deliver the same to the local authorities or to its owner;

x x x x


Reading the above provision, it is noteworthy that it does not matter if
 the finder knows the true owner of the lost property for him to be 
convicted of the crime of theft for failure to return the same. As 
pointed out in the 
ponencia
, the RPC does not require that the 
thief must know the owner of the lost property; the subject penal 
provision gives the finder the option to return the lost property not 
only to the owner thereof but also to the local authorities. This is an 
apparent change from the second subsection of Article 517 of the 1870 
Codigo Penal
,
 enforced in the Philippines prior to the effectivity of the Revised 
Penal Code in 1932, which requires that the finder must have knowledge 
of the identity of the true owner of the misplaced or lost thing,
[1]
 to wit: 
"Son
 reos de hurto: ... (2) Los que encontrÃ¡ndose una cosa perdida y 
sabiendo quiÃ©n es su dueÃ±o se la apropriaren co intentiÃ³n de lucro"
[2]
 or, if translated, says, 
"Those are guilty of theft:.... 2. Who, finding a lost thing, and 
knowing who the owner is
, appropriate it with intent to gain."
[3]


Relevant to the above discussion is the provision under Article 719 of 
the New Civil Code of the Philippines which sheds light on a situation 
where the finder of a lost property does not know the owner of the thing
 found. It provides:


Article 719.
 Whoever finds a movable, which is not 
treasure, must return it to its previous possessor. If the latter is 
unknown, the finder shall immediately deposit it with the mayor of the 
city or municipality where the finding has taken place.

The finding shall be publicly announced by the mayor for two consecutive
 weeks in the way he deems best.

If the movable cannot be kept without deterioration, or without expenses
 which considerably diminish its value, it shall be sold at public 
auction eight days after the publication.

Six months from the publication having elapsed without the owner having 
appeared, the thing found, or its value, shall be awarded to the finder.
 The finder and the owner shall be obliged, as the case may be, to 
reimburse the expenses.


As it stands now, the proper thing for a finder of a lost property of 
unknown owner, except hidden treasure, to do is to return or turn it 
over to the proper authority, who is the mayor of the city or 
municipality where the finding has taken place. Thereafter, the 
provision in Article 719 shall apply. Nevertheless, the failure, 
per se
, to turn it over to the mayor does not constitute the crime of theft. 
People v. Rodrigo
[4]
 instructs that there must be a deliberate failure on the part of the finder to return the lost thing. Thus:


[U]nder paragraph 2, subparagraph (1), the elements are (1) 
the finding of lost property; and (2) the failure of the finder to 
deliver the same to the local authorities or to its owner. In this kind 
of theft intent of gain is 
inferred from the deliberate failure to deliver the lost property to the proper person
, the finder knowing that the property does not belong to him.


As such, if a finder of lost thing of unknown owner turns it over to 
other local authorities or to any individual with the instruction or 
intention of returning it to the owner or to the proper authority, he 
could not be held guilty of the crime of theft. Such action negates the 
intent not to return the thing to the proper persons, much less an 
intent to gain or to appropriate the lost property. On the other hand, 
if the finder uses or appropriates the thing found or keeps the same for
 an unreasonable period of time, he is certainly guilty of theft. Such 
action constitutes a deliberate failure to deliver the lost property to 
the proper persons which is punished under Article 308 paragraph 2 (1).

In this case, the actions of Pante clearly establish that there was a 
deliberate intention on his part not to return or turn over the lost 
dollar bills he received from his minor co-accused to the owner or to 
the proper authority. First, he knew that the dollar bills were not 
owned but were just found by his minor co-accused.
[5]
 Second, he took a portion of the lost dollar bills, kept the same for a few days, and exchanged them to Philippine Currency.
[6]

 Third, he instructed his minor co-accused not to return the money. 
Fourth, he used the money to buy JVC component, a gas stove with a tank,
 a CD cassette, and construction materials.
[7]

 Concomitantly, not only that Pante did not have the intention to return
 the lost property to the owner or to proper authorities, he likewise 
appropriated the same for his own gain and benefit. Thus, he is guilty 
of the crime of theft.

Furthermore, I agree with the 
ponencia
 in rejecting Pante's argument that he cannot be convicted of theft because he is not a finder of the lost property. The 
ponente
 has appropriately cited the case of 
People v. Avila
[8]

 to elucidate that the finder under Article 308, par. 2 (1) is not 
limited to the actual finder or "finder in fact" of the lost property 
but also extends to the "finder in law" or one who receives the lost 
property from the actual finder and then appropriates the same or 
deliberately fails to return it to the owner or to proper authorities.

I must stress, though, that for one to be considered a "finder in law" 
and be held guilty for the crime of theft, he must have received the 
lost property from the actual finder who has no intention to appropriate
 the said property. This is the scenario under which the ruling in 
People v. Avila
 
(Avila)

 was arrived at by the Court. In that case, it was the driver of the 
carretela which actually found the purse containing money, gold coins, 
and jewels, left by his passenger inside the aforesaid carriage. He, 
however, handed the purse to the accused therein, who happened to be 
police officer, and asked him to deliver it to the owner. The accused 
therein, instead of returning it, appropriated the purse with all its 
contents. Accordingly, the Court pointed out the principal question in 
the said case to wit:


The principal question presented for consideration is one of
 law x x x. In other words, is this form of theft limited to the actual 
finder, using the word in its literal and most limited sense, or does it
 include misappropriation 
by any one into whose hands the property may be placed by the actual finder for delivery to the true and known owner?
 x x x


In ruling that the accused is guilty of theft, the Court in 
Avila

 held that "the accused occupied towards the purse, from the time he 
took it into his hands, precisely the same relation as if he had picked 
it up himself."
[9]
 It 
underscored that "the accused was a finder in law, if not in fact; and 
his act in appropriating the property was of precisely the same 
character as if it had been originally found by him."
[10]

 Citing English and American jurisprudence, the Court further ruled that
 "one who receives property from the finder thereof assumes, in legal 
contemplation, by voluntary substitution, as to the property and the 
owner, the relation occupied by the finder, placing himself in the 
finder's stead. In such a case, whether the person taking the property 
in guilty must be determined on the same principles that govern in the 
case of the actual finder."
[11]
 To further support its stand, the Court cited the American case of 
Allen v. State (Allen)
[12]
 and held:


In [Allen], some children found a pocketbook containing 
money and certain papers sufficient to identify the owner. Upon arriving
 home, the children delivered the purse to their father, who converted 
it to his own use. It was held that the accused was properly convicted 
and that his guilt was to be determined by the same principles that 
would have governed if he had been the actual finder. In the course of 
the opinion the following language was used:


* * * Finding it, and its delivery to the defendant by the 
finder, did not deprive the money, as to the owner, of the character or 
status

 of lost property; the ownership remained in him, drawing to it, 
constructively, the right of possession. When defendant took the money 
from his children, he knew it had been lost, and took it as such. 
It is manifest the children had no felonious intent,

 and properly delivered the money to their father for his disposition. 
By receiving it from his children, knowing it was lost, defendant 
assumed, in legal contemplation, by voluntary substitution, as to the 
money and the owner, the relation occupied by the finders, placing 
himself in their stead. Otherwise a person knowingly receiving lost 
property from the finder, 
who had no intent to steal,
 with the 
felonious intent to appropriate it to his own use, escapes punishment. 
In such case, whether or not the person taking the money is guilty of 
larceny must be determined on the same principles which govern in the 
case of the actual finder.


Based on the foregoing pronouncements and under the circumstances in which 
Avila

 was decided by the Court, and at the expense of being repetitive, I am 
of the opinion that for one to be considered a "finder in law" and be 
held guilty for the crime of theft, he must have received the lost 
property from the actual finder who has no intention to appropriate the 
same. I find this compelling to point out due to my humble opinion that 
if the actual finder already has the deliberate intention not to return 
the lost property, then he is the one who should be held liable as a 
principal in the crime for theft and that the persons who receive or 
profit from the stolen property should only be considered as a fence, 
which under our present laws may be punished as an accessory under 
paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the RPC
[13]
 to the crime of theft, or as a principal in the crime of fencing under Presidential Decree No. 1612,
[14]
 otherwise known as the "Anti-Fencing Law of 1979."
[15]

 Having said that, let me explain why Pante is properly convicted as a 
principal in the crime of theft and not merely considered as a fence.

It may be recalled that when Pante's minor co-accused found the lost 
bundle of dollar bills, he went to his cousin, the other minor 
co-accused, and Pante.
[16]
 At 
this point in time, there was no deliberate intent yet on the part of 
said minor co-accused not to return the lost property to its owner or to
 the proper authorities as the said minor actual finder did not know yet
 what to do with the money.
[17]

 Then came Pante, who, being the only adult among the accused, got hold 
of the lost money, took 17 pieces of US$100.00 dollar bills for himself 
and instructed the two minor co-accused not to return the money.
[18]

 At that moment, by taking a portion of the lost money, Pante became a 
"finder in law" with respect to the amount he took from the actual 
finder-minor accused. He assumed, in legal contemplation, the relation 
occupied by the actual finder with respect to the property and the 
owner. This obliged him to return the lost and found property to the 
owner or to the proper authorities. Instead, Pante appropriated the 
aforesaid amount for himself which makes him liable as principal in the 
crime of theft. It may not be amiss to point out that it was only after 
Pante took possession of a portion of the lost property and only after 
giving instruction to the two minor co-accused to keep the money for 
themselves that the actual finder-minor accused's intention not to 
return the money became manifest and deliberate when he acceded to 
Pante's instruction and began appropriating the money he found.

Based on the foregoing disquisitions, I vote to 
DENY
 the petition and 
AFFIRM
 the Decision of the Court of Appeals with 
MODIFICATION
 as to the penalty imposed against petitioner Fernando Pante 
y
 Rangasa, as discussed in the 
ponencia

 Article 19. 
Accessories
.
 - Accessories are those who, having knowledge of the commission of the 
crime, and without having participated therein, either as principals or 
accomplices, take part subsequent to its commission in any of the 
following manners:

By profiting themselves or assisting the offender to profit by the effects of the crime.


By concealing or destroying the body of the crime, or the effects or instruments thereof, in order to prevent its discovery.


By harboring, concealing, or assisting in the escape of the 
principals of the crime, provided the accessory acts with abuse of his 
public functions or whenever the author of the crime is guilty of 
treason, parricide, murder, or an attempt to take the life of the Chief 
Executive, or is known to be habitually guilty of some other crime.


[14]
 Section 2 of PD 1612 
defines Fencing as "the act of any person who, with intent to gain for 
himself or for another, shall buy, receive, possess, keep, acquire, 
conceal, sell or dispose of, or shall buy and sell, or in any other 
manner deal in any article, item, object or anything of value which he 
knows, or should be known to him, to have been derived from the proceeds
 of the crime of robbery or theft." The same Section also states that a 
Fence "includes any person, firm, association, corporation or 
partnership or other organization who/which commits the act of fencing."

 In 
Dizon-Pamintuan v. People

 (G.R. No. 111426, July 11, 1994, 234 SCRA 63), the Court held that 
while a Fence may be prosecuted either as an accessory of Robbery/Theft 
or a principal for Fencing, there is a preference for the prosecution of
 the latter as it provides for harsher penalties.
