MARYLOU R. ANCHETA, IN HER AND ON BEHALF OF HER MISSING FORMER COMMON-LAW HUSBAND RICARDO DIONILA, PETITIONER, VS. MARY CAMBAY,** RESPONDENT.


D E C I S I O N




HERNANDO, J.:


 This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assails the March 16, 2012 Decision
[2]
 and the October 18, 2012 Resolution
[3]

 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 102517 which denied the 
Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by herein petitioner Marylou R.
 Ancheta (Ancheta).

The assailed Decision and Resolution of the CA were rendered in 
connection with the August 31, 2005 Decision
[4]

 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 14 of Lagawe, Ifugao in a 
case filed by herein respondent Mary Cambay (Cambay) entitled 
"Mary Cambay v. Vivian Ancheta and Spouses Ricardo Dionila and Marilou Ancheta"

 and docketed as SPL Civil Action No. 64 ordering petitioner and her 
co-defendants therein to pay Cambay P50,000.00 plus interest at the rate
 of 24% per 
annum
 starting one year after June 16, 2003 until fully paid.


Factual Antecedents:


On June 12, 2003, Vivian Ancheta (Vivian) obtained a loan from Cambay in
 the amount of P25,000.00 with a 10% monthly interest payable within two
 months from even date. As security for the loan, Vivian executed a Real
 Estate Mortgage
[5]
 in favor 
of Cambay over a parcel of land located in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. 
Considering, however, that said parcel of land was registered under the 
names of Ancheta and her former common-law-spouse Ricardo Dionila 
(Dionila) under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-5 8527,
[6]
 Ancheta and Dionila allegedly executed on June 10, 2003 a Special Power of Attorney (SPA)
[7]

 in favor of Vivian authorizing her to use the land as collateral for 
her loan with Cambay. On June 16, 2003, Vivian obtained another loan 
from Cambay in the amount of P25,000.00 evidenced by a Promissory Note.
[8]


Alleging that Vivian failed to settle her obligation upon maturity 
despite repeated demands, Cambay filed on August 30, 2004 a Complaint 
for Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage
[9]

 against Vivian, Ancheta, and Dionila before the RTC. Ancheta narrated 
that while summons was served on and received by Vivian, no summons ever
 reached her (Ancheta) and/or Dionila.

Meanwhile, Vivian filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer
[10]
 with the RTC, which the latter favorably acted upon per its September 29, 2004 Order.
[11]

 However, neither Vivian, Ancheta, nor Dionila filed an Answer to 
Cambay's Complaint. Meanwhile, the RTC scheduled a pre-trial Conference 
on March 16, 2005 but was later reset to May 18, 2005 in an Order dated 
March 16, 2005.
[12]
 A copy of 
the March 16, 2005 Order of the RTC was not personally served on Ancheta
 and Dionila. A copy thereof, however, was supposedly received by their 
son, Ricmar John A. Dionila.
[13]


After trial on the merits, the RTC, on August 31, 2005, rendered a Decision
[14]
 by default against Vivian, Ancheta, and Dionila the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE,
 judgment by default is hereby issued in 
favor of the plaintiff pursuant to Sec. 2 Rule 68. The court hereby 
finds the amount of P50,000.00 plus interest at the rate of 24% per 
annum starting one year after June 16, 2003 until folly paid to be due 
payable to the plaintiff.

Defendants are directed to pay the said amount of money to the court or 
to the judgment [obligee] within 120 days from entry of judgment and in 
default of such payment the property shall be sold at public auction.


SO ORDERED.
[15]


The August 31, 2005 Decision of the RTC became final and executory, and 
entered in the book of entries of judgment on September 26, 2005.
[16]


Subsequently, the Clerk of Court and 
ex-officio
 Provincial Sheriff implemented the August 31, 2005 Decision of the RTC and, by virtue of an Absolute Deed of Sale
[17]

 dated May 22, 2007, sold the parcel of land to Cambay. Cambay 
subsequently consolidated her ownership over the property which resulted
 in the issuance of TCT No. T-145718 in her favor by the Register of 
Deeds of Nueva Viscaya
[18]
 and the cancellation of TCT No. T-58527
[19]
 in the names of Ancheta and Dionila.

On August 14, 2006, Ancheta filed with the RTC a Petition for Relief from Judgment
[20]

 arguing, among others, that: (1) Ancheta came to know of the case 
docketed as SPL Civil Action No. 64 only sometime in February 2006; (2) 
no summons was personally served on her and/or Dionila; and (3) the June
 10, 2003 SPA purportedly executed by Ancheta and Dionila empowering 
Vivian to utilize the land as security for her loan with Cambay was 
falsified, and thus, null and void.

The RTC, in its October 17, 2006 Order
[21]
 docketed as SPL Civil Case No. 82, dismissed Ancheta's Petition for Relief of Judgment, ratiocinating as follows:


The rule is explicit and mandatory that the petition must be filed within 
sixty (60) days after he/she learns of the judgment and not later than Six (6) months after judgment or final order was entered.

 Apparently, the petition was filed years after the judgment was 
rendered. Hence, the petition has to be dismissed.

Further, the Rule requires that the petition must be accompanied by an 
affidavit showing that fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence
 attended or contributed to the failure of defendant to partake in the 
proceedings of the case. In the instant petition, the affidavit fails to
 state facts constituting fraud, accident, mistake or excusable 
negligence. The allegations contain only substantial cause of defense 
which are collateral matters, such as the validity of the special power 
of attorney.

Petitioner contends that the special power of attorney which was 
purportedly executed by her is null and void for it is a forged one. 
Such defense could not be entertained, because the validity of a public 
document cannot be assailed collaterally. There must be an action filed 
to declare it void, for the presumption that it was duly executed before
 the notary public.
[22]


Undeterred, Ancheta assailed the August 31, 2005 Decision of the RTC in 
SPL Civil Action No. 64 by filing with the CA on February 29, 2008 a 
Petition for Annulment of Judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court 
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the persons of Ancheta and 
Dionila.
[23]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:


On March 16, 2012, the CA rendered its assailed Decision
[24]
, dismissing Ancheta's Petition for Annulment of Judgment, as follows:


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
DISMISSED
. The 
Petition for Annulment of Judgment cannot be availed of because 
Petitioner already resorted to Petition for Relief from Judgment and 
lost therefrom.


SO ORDERED.
[25]


According to the CA -


Since Petitioner had already availed of the remedy of 
petition for relief of judgment, she could no longer avail of a petition
 for annulment of judgment. x x x As mentioned earlier, the remedy [of a
 Petition for Annulment of Judgment] may not be invoked where the party 
already resorted to certain remedies, such as a petition for relief, and
 only lost in the process.
[26]


Ancheta thus moved for the reconsideration of the March 16, 2012 
Decision of the appellate court. In her Motion for Reconsideration,
[27]

 Ancheta emphasized that her petition was grounded on lack of 
jurisdiction, not extrinsic fraud. She argued that while extrinsic fraud
 is not a valid ground under a Petition for Annulment of Judgment if the
 same was already previously availed of, or could have been availed of, 
in a petition for relief, no such rule is applicable with respect to 
relief from judgment grounded on lack of jurisdiction.


In its assailed October 18, 2012 Resolution,
[28]
 the appellate court denied Ancheta's Motion for Reconsideration. Hence, the instant petition.


Issues


[A] Whether a named defendant in a judicial foreclosure case
 who was not served with summons may file an action for annulment of 
judgment which was rendered by default; and

[B.] Whether a prior resort [to] a relief from judgment, albeit 
erroneously availed of, bars a resort to the remedy of annulment of 
judgment.
[29]


Simply put, the issue in this case is whether or not the CA erred when 
it dismissed Ancheta's Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

In her Petition, Ancheta maintains that only the ground of extrinsic 
fraud, not lack of jurisdiction, is excluded as a valid ground for a 
petition for annulment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court if the same 
ground was availed of, or could have been availed of, in a petition for 
relief under Rule 38 of the same rules. Ancheta also insists that "a 
party who has previously availed of the remedy of Petition for Relief of
 Judgment, albeit an erroneous remedy, is not precluded from resorting 
to the correct remedy of Petition for Annulment of Judgment."
[30]


For her part, Cambay maintains in her Comment
[31]

 that Ancheta can no longer resort to an action for annulment of 
judgment since she had already filed a petition for relief with the RTC 
which she lost.


Our Ruling


The Petition is meritorious.


Ancheta availed of the remedy of
a Petition for Relief from
Judgment with the RTC.


The records show that Ancheta made inconsistent claims before the RTC 
and the CA, specifically, as to when she acquired knowledge of the 
proceedings in SPL Civil Action No. 64 and the judgment by default 
rendered by the RTC on August 31, 2005. In particular, while Ancheta, on
 one hand, stated in her petition for relief that she "came to know of 
the [case] only sometime during the last week of February, 2006 x x x,"
[32]

 her petition for annulment, on the other hand, stated that she "learned
 for the first that the assailed judgment by default was rendered 
against her sometime in April 2006 x x x."
[33]


Notably, despite Ancheta's assertion in her petition for annulment, the 
appellate court, for its part, underscored the allegation in her 
petition for relief, 
i.e.
, that she acquired knowledge of SPL 
Civil Action No. 64 "during the last week of February 26," and on the 
basis thereof, dismissed Ancheta's petition for annulment, with the 
following ratiocination:


In the case at bar, it is evident that Petitioner, after learning about the RTC's August 31, 2005 
Decision 
"during the last week of February 2006"
, filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment
.
 Unfortunately, the RTC denied the same for lack of merit based on the 
following reasons: (1) the petition was filed beyond the reglementary 
period provided under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; x x x.

Since petitioner has already availed of the remedy of petition for 
relief from judgment, she could no longer avail of a petition for 
annulment of judgment.
[34]
 (Underscoring supplied; italics in the original)


Ancheta, however, asserts in her petition before this Court that her 
previous filing of a petition for relief with the RTC in SPL Civil 
Action No. 82 cannot, under the circumstances, be considered an 
appropriate or proper remedy
 under Section l
[35]

 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Court because it was no longer legally and 
procedurally available to her at the time she acquired knowledge of the 
proceedings in SPL Civil Action No. 64 sometime in April 2006.

Ancheta insists that the CA erred in dismissing her petition for 
annulment since under the circumstances of her case, she could not have 
timely filed a petition for relief with the RTC in the first place.

This Court, however, is not inclined to embark on an extended discussion
 on whether the petition for relief filed by Ancheta with the RTC was 
proper or appropriate, or whether the same was filed beyond the period 
prescribed by the Rules of Court. It is beyond the province of this 
Court to disturb the findings in the October 17, 2006 Order of the RTC 
in SPL Civil Case No. 82, for it is not our function to re-examine a 
decision not the subject of review in this petition and which has long 
attained finality. On this point, the Court establishes as a foregone 
fact, there being no issue raised on the matter, that Ancheta indeed had
 already availed of the remedy of a petition for relief with the RTC 
which the latter dismissed in its October 17, 2006 Order.

Considering the foregoing, the pith of the issue, therefore, lies in 
whether Ancheta is already barred from filing with the CA a petition for
 annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court.


Ancheta is not precluded from
filing a petition for annulment of
judgment with the CA.


Rule 47 of the Rules of Court provides for the remedy of annulment of 
judgment with the appellate court of the judgments, final orders, and 
resolutions of the RTCs in civil actions for which the ordinary remedies
 of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies
 are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner. 
Significantly, Section 2, Rule 47 of the Rules limits the ground for the
 action of annulment of judgment to either extrinsic fraud or lack of 
jurisdiction, 
viz
.:


Section 2. 
Grounds for annulment
. â The annulment may be based only on the grounds of 
extrinsic fraud
 and 
lack of jurisdiction
.


Extrinsic fraud
 shall not be a valid ground if it was availed 
of, or could have been availed of, in a motion for new trial or petition
 for relief.
 (Underscoring and emphasis supplied)


"Lack of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court in rendering the 
judgment or final order is either lack of jurisdiction over the subject 
matter or nature of the action, or lack of jurisdiction over the person 
of the petitioner."
[36]


On the other hand, "[t]he overriding consideration when extrinsic fraud 
is alleged is that the fraudulent scheme of the prevailing litigant 
prevented the petitioner from having his day in court."
[37]

 At this juncture, worth reiterating is the rule that extrinsic fraud 
shall not be a valid ground if it was availed of, or could have been 
availed of, in a motion for new trial or petition for relief.
[38]



This means that the remedy of annulment of judgment, albeit a "last remedy,"
[39]

 is not an alternative remedy to the ordinary remedies of new trial, 
appeal, or a petition for relief. It must show or allege that the 
ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other 
appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of 
petitioner.
[40]
 Notably, we have held in 
Jose v. Intra Strata Assurance Corporation
[41]
 that "it is only 
extrinsic fraud
,
 not lack of jurisdiction, which is excluded as a valid ground for 
annulment if it was availed of, or could have been availed of, in a 
motion for new trial or petition for relief."
[42]

 This is because a judgment rendered without jurisdiction by the trial 
court is fundamentally void or nonÂ­existent, and therefore, can be 
"assailed at any time either collaterally or by direct action or by 
resisting such judgment or final order in any action or proceeding 
whenever it is invoked."
[43]
 The case of 
Pinausukan Seafood House, Roxas Boulevard, Inc. v. Far East Bank & Trust Co
.
[44]
 is instructive on this point, 
viz
.:


The first requirement prescribes that the remedy is 
available only when the petitioner can no longer resort to the ordinary 
remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate 
remedies through no fault of the petitioner. This means that the remedy,
 although seen as "a last remedy," is not an alternative to the ordinary
 remedies of new trial, appeal and petition for relief. The petition 
must aver, therefore, that the petitioner failed to move for a new 
trial, or to appeal, or to file a petition for relief without fault on 
his part. 
But this requirement to aver is not imposed when the ground
 for the petition is lack of jurisdiction (whether alleged singly or in 
combination with extrinsic fraud), simply because the judgment or final 
order, being void, may be assailed at any time either collaterally or by
 direct action or by resisting such judgment or final order in any 
action or proceeding whenever it is invoked,
 unless the ground of lack of jurisdiction is meanwhile barred by laches.
[45]
 (Emphasis supplied)


Also, in 
Coombs v. CastaÃ±eda
,
[46]
 we similarly held that -


Moreover, the Court of Appeals' dismissal based on technical grounds (
i.e.
,
 failure to allege that she did not avail of a motion for new trial, 
appeal, petition for relief, or other appropriate remedies and failure 
to append the affidavits of witnesses or documents supporting the cause 
of action of her petition) was also erroneous.


First
, when a petition for annulment of judgment is grounded 
on lack of jurisdiction, the petitioner need not allege that the 
ordinary remedy of new trial or reconsideration of the judgment sought 
to be annulled are no longer available through no fault of her own. This
 is because a judgment rendered without jurisdiction is fundamentally 
void.
 Thus, it may be questioned any time unless laches has already set in.
[47]


Thus, considering that the ground relied upon in the petition for 
annulment is lack of jurisdiction over the persons of Ancheta and 
Dionila, it was not necessary nor was it essential on the part of the CA
 to establish first, before it could have ruled on the merits of the 
petition for annulment, whether the remedy of petition for relief was 
earlier availed of by Ancheta. This is all the more so in this case 
where the issue of lack of jurisdiction was not even categorically ruled
 upon by the RTC. At most, Ancheta may have been barred from raising the
 defense of fraud in her petition for annulment with the CA.
[48]

 However, this should not have prevented the appellate court from ruling
 on the merits of the petition for annulment filed before it, and 
definitively rule on the issue of lack of jurisdiction raised therein.

Accordingly, we hold that while Ancheta had previously availed of the 
remedy of a petition for relief with the RTC, she is not precluded from 
filing with the CA a petition for annulment of judgment â one that is 
essentially anchored on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. If she can 
prove that she and Dionila were indeed not duly served with summons, the
 RTC never acquired jurisdiction over them, hence, its August 31, 2005 
Judgment would be void 
ab initio
, and the CA would thus be 
duty-bound to strike it down. We have observed, however, that instead of
 fully addressing the issue of lack of jurisdiction raised before it, 
the CA opted to dismiss the case outright based on a mere technical, 
albeit erroneous, interpretation of the rules. This the Court cannot 
countenance.

Lack of jurisdiction being a valid ground for annulment of a judgment, 
and one which may negate the court's acquisition of jurisdiction, 
including defective service of summons, it is a well-founded cause for 
an action for annulment of a judgment.
