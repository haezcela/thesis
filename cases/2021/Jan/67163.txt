LOPEZ, J.:


Central in this Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, assailing the Resolutions dated June 3, 2014
[2]
 and December 11, 2014
[3]

 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 129182, is the exemption
 from real property tax of petitioner Metropolitan Waterworks and 
Sewerage System (MWSS).


Facts



On June 19, 1971, Republic Act (RA) No. 6234
[4]

 created MWSS "to insure an uninterrupted and adequate supply and 
distribution of potable water for domestic and other purposes and the 
proper operation and maintenance of sewerage systems."
[5]

 It was vested with the power to exercise supervision and control over 
all waterworks and sewerage systems within Metro Manila, Rizal, and a 
portion of Cavite.
[6]





In 1997, pursuant to RA No. 8041
[7]

 or the "National Water Crisis Act of 1995," MWSS entered into a 
concessionaire agreement with Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (Maynilad) 
to service the West Zone of the Metropolitan Area that includes Pasay 
City.



On February 21, 2008, MWSS received Real Property Tax Computations
[8]

 from the Pasay City Treasurer for taxable year 2008, demanding payment 
of real property taxes in the total amount of P166,629.36. Allegedly on 
the same day, MWSS filed a Protest Letter
[9]

 dated February 3, 2008, addressed to then Pasay City Mayor Wenceslao 
Peewee Trinidad. MWSS argued that it is a public utility and a 
government instrumentality, and its properties and facilities are exempt
 from real property tax, consistent with its position in the Petition 
for 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition with the CA that it filed against the local government of Quezon City, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 100733.
[10]
 This claim was anchored upon the case of 
Manila International Airport Authority v. CA
,
[11]
 (
MIAA
) that declared MIAA a government instrumentality exercising corporate powers,
[12]
 and thus, exempt from real property taxes under Section 133(o)
[13]
 and Section 234(a)
[14]
 of RA No. 7160
[15]
 or the "Local Government Code of 1991" (LGC).
[16]





Due to inaction on the part of the Pasay City Treasurer, MWSS filed an appeal to the Local Board of Assessment Appeals (LBAA).
[17]


LBAA Ruling



The LBAA observed MWSS's non-compliance with Section 252
[18]

 of the LGC for failure to file protest with the city treasurer that 
made the assessment final and not appealable. Nonetheless, the LBAA 
resolved the substantive issue on whether MWSS is liable to pay real 
property taxes. It ruled that the MWSS is a government-owned or 
controlled corporation (GOCC), not a government instrumentality. Hence, 
the doctrine of tax exemption enunciated in 
MIAA
 is not 
applicable. It also pointed out that when the MWSS entered into a 
concessionaire agreement with Maynilad, the actual use of its real 
properties was turned over to a taxable person. Therefore, the 
assessment of real property taxes against the MWSS was "reasonable and 
collectible."
[19]





Aggrieved, the MWSS filed an appeal to the Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA).


CBAA Ruling



In its Decision
[20]
 dated 
August 30, 2012, the CBAA affirmed the assessment's finality, not for 
failure to comply with Section 252 of the LGC, but for failure to 
question the legality of the assessment before the city assessor in 
accordance with Section 226
[21]
 of the LGC.
[22]
 For this reason, the CBAA did not discuss the merits of the case for being moot and academic.





 


MWSS filed a motion for reconsideration (MR), but it was denied in an Order
[23]

 dated February 27, 2013. In denying the MR, the CBAA acknowledged that 
MWSS is a government instrumentality, recognized under RA No. 10149,
[24]

 or the "GOCC Governance Act of 2011." As such, it cannot be subjected 
to local taxes, fees and charges as provided under Section 133(o)
[25]
 of the LGC. However, this is not relevant since the collections involved are real property taxes. Instead, Section 40(a)
[26]
 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 464,
[27]
 as embodied under Section 234(a)
[28]

 of the LGC should apply. In other words, the CBAA ruled that the common
 limitation on the taxing power of the local government under Section 
133(o) should not affect the imposition of real property taxes. Besides,
 MWSS 's tax exemption under Section 18
[29]
 of its Charter (RA No. 6234)
[30]
 had already been withdrawn by Section 234 of the LGC, which states:


SEC. 234. x x x


x x x x


Except as provided herein, any exemption from payment of real property 
tax previously granted to, or presently enjoyed by, all persons, whether
 natural or juridical, including all government-owned or - controlled 
corporations are hereby withdrawn upon the effectivity of this Code.





MWSS appealed the CBAA's ruling to the CA.


CA Ruling



In a Resolution
[31]
 dated June
 3, 2014, the CA dismissed MWSS's appeal for failure to exhaust 
administrative remedies as provided under Sections 206
[32]
 and 252
[33]
 of the LGC, requiring proof of exemption and payment under protest, thus:


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DISMISSED
. The assailed dispositions dated August 30, 2012 and February 27, 2013 
STAND
.


SO ORDERED.
[34]



MWSS's MR was denied in a Resolution
[35]
 dated December 11, 2014, hence, this petition.


Issues



(1) Did the CA err in dismissing MWSS's appeal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies?



(2) Is Pasay City authorized to assess and collect real property taxes from MWSS?


Ruling






Administrative remedies are inapplicable when the issue presented is a pure question of law.


 







The CA palpably erred in dismissing MWSS's appeal solely on the ground 
of the alleged non-exhaustion of administrative remedies under the LGC. A
 careful reading of MWSS's arguments and allegations reveals that it is 
neither challenging the reasonableness or correctness of the City 
Assessor's assessment nor asserting error on the part of the City 
Treasurer's computation of the assessed tax. Plainly, MWSS is assailing 
the authority of the city assessor and treasurer to assess and collect 
real property taxes against it. The issue of whether a local government 
is authorized to assess and collect real property taxes from a 
government entity is a pure question of law,
[36]
 which is beyond the LBAA and CBAA's jurisdiction.












 
 


In the oft-cited case of 
Ty v. Hon. Trampe
,
[37]

 the Court held that the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies 
does not apply when the controversy does not involve questions of fact 
but only of law.
[38]
 The 
protest contemplated under Section 252 of the LGC is required when there
 is question as to the reasonableness or correctness of the amount 
assessed, while an appeal to the LBAA under Section 226 is fruitful only
 where questions of fact are involved.
[39]

 Accordingly, when the very authority and power of the assessor to 
impose the assessment, and of the treasurer to collect real property 
taxes are in question, the proper recourse is a judicial action.
[40]





Thus, despite the alleged non-exhaustion of administrative remedies, we 
give due course to the instant Petition on the ground that the 
controversy only involves a question of law.
[41]








MWSS is a government 
instrumentality with corporate powers, not liable to the local 
government of Pasay City for real property taxes. The tax exemption that
 its properties carries, however, ceases when their beneficial use has 
been extended to a taxable person. The liability to pay real property 
taxes on government-owned properties, the beneficial or actual use of 
which was granted to a taxable entity, devolves on the taxable 
beneficial user.


 







The case of 
Metropolitan Waterworks Sewerage System v. The Local Government of Quezon City
[42]

 (2018 MWSS Case), which reviewed the CA Decision in CA-GR. SP No. 
100733, has already settled with finality that MWSS is a government 
instrumentality vested with corporate powers, and as such, exempt from 
payment of real property taxes. The Court explained that with the 
issuance of Executive Order No. 596,
[43]
 as well as the passage of RA No. 10149,
[44]

 the Executive and the Legislative Branches have explicitly classified 
MWSS as a government instrumentality with corporate powers, thus:


Be that as it may, this Court's categorization cannot 
supplant that which was previously made by me Executive and Legislative 
Branches. After the promulgation of 
Manila International Airport Authority
,
 then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive Order No. 596, 
which recognized this Court's categorization of "government 
instrumentalities vested with corporate powers." Section 1 of Executive 
Order No. 596 states:


Section 1. The Office of the Government Corporate Counsel 
(OGCC) shall be the principal law office of all GOCCs, except as may 
otherwise be provided by their respective charter or authorized by the 
President, their subsidiaries, corporate offsprings, and government 
acquired asset corporations. The OGCC shall likewise be the principal 
law office of "government instrumentality vested with corporate powers" 
or "government corporate entity[,"] as defined by the Supreme Court in 
the case of "
MIAA vs. Court of Appeals, City of ParaÃ±aque, et al.
[,"] [
supra
],
 notable examples of which are: Manila International Airport Authority 
(MIAA), Mactan International Airport Authority, the Philippine Ports 
Authority (PPA), Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), 
Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Services

 (MWSS), Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI), Laguna Lake 
Development Authority (LLDA), Fisheries Development Authority (FDA), 
Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA), Cebu Port Authority 
(CPA), Cagayan de Oro Port Authority, and San Fernando Port Authority.


Under this provision, petitioner is categorized with other government 
agencies that were found to be exempt from the payment of real property 
taxes.




In 2011, Congress passed Republic Act No. 10149 or the GOCC Governance 
Act of 2011, which adopted the same categorization and explicitly lists 
petitioner together with the other government agencies that were 
previously held by this Court to be exempt from the payment of real 
property taxes:


(n) - 
Government Instrumentalities with Corporate Powers (GICP)/Government Corporate Entities (GCE)

 refer to instrumentalities or agencies of the government, which are 
neither corporations nor agencies integrated within the departmental 
framework, but vested by law with special functions or jurisdiction, 
endowed with some if not all corporate powers, administering special 
funds, and enjoying operational autonomy usually through a charter 
including, but not limited to, the following: the Manila International 
Airport Authority (MIAA), the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), the 
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), the 
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)
,
 the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), the Philippine Fisheries 
Development Authority (PFDA), the Bases Conversion and Development 
Authority (BCDA), the Cebu Port Authority (CPA), the Cagayan de Oro Port
 Authority, the San Fernando Port Authority, the Local Water Utilities 
Administration (LWUA) and the Asian Productivity Organization (APO).



The Executive and Legislative Branches, therefore, have already 
categorized petitioner not as a government-owned and -controlled 
corporation but as a Government Instrumentality with Corporate 
Powers/Government Corporate Entity like the Manila International Airport
 Authority and the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority. 
Privileges enjoyed by these Government Instrumentalities with Corporate 
Powers/Government Corporate Entities should necessarily also extend to 
petitioner. Hence, petitioner's real property tax exemption under 
Republic Act No. 6234 is still valid as the proviso of Section 234 of 
the Local Government Code is only applicable to government-owned and 
-controlled corporations.


Thus, petitioner is not liable to respondent Local Government of Quezon 
City for real property taxes, except if the beneficial use of its 
properties has been extended to a taxable person.


Respondents have not alleged that the beneficial use of any of 
petitioner's properties was extended to a taxable person. In the absence
 of any allegation to the contrary, petitioner's properties in Quezon 
City are not subject to the levy of real property taxes.
[45]
 (Citations omitted.)



Consistent with our ruling in the 2018 MWSS Case, in relation to 
MIAA
, the tax exemptions under Sections 133(o) and 234(a) of the LGC apply to MWSS, 
viz
.:


SEC. 133. Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local 
Government Units. - Unless otherwise provided herein, the exercise of 
the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays 
shall not extend to the levy of the following:


x x x x


(o) Taxes, fees, or charges of any kind on the National Government, its 
agencies and instrumentalities, and local government units.


SEC. 234. Exemptions from Real Property Tax. - The following are exempted from payment of the real property tax:


(a) Real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its
 political subdivisions except when the beneficial use thereof has been 
granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person[.]



These provisions are clear as to a government instrumentality's tax exemption. In brief, 
MIAA

 explained that this limitation to the local government's taxing power 
recognizes the basic principle that local governments cannot tax the 
national government, which merely delegated to local governments the 
power to tax. While the 1987 Constitution now includes taxation as one 
of the powers of local governments, local governments may only exercise 
such power "subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress 
may provide."
[46]
 Thus, when 
local governments invoke their power to tax on government 
instrumentalities, such power is construed strictly against local 
governments.
[47]





The tax exemption under Section 234(a), however, ceases when the 
beneficial use of the real properties is alleged and proved to have been
 granted, for a consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person.
[48]

 Beneficial use means actual use or possession of the property. Actual 
use refers to the purpose for which the property is principally or 
predominantly utilized by the person in possession thereof.
[49]



In this case, there was an allegation that the beneficial use of MWSS's 
properties in Pasay were given to Maynilad by virtue of a concession 
agreement. This factual allegation, however, was not proved and merely 
based on a sweeping conclusion that when MWSS entered into a concession 
agreement, all its properties were effectively turned over to the 
concessionaires for their operations. At this point, the Court cannot 
make a judicious determination of such factual matter due to the 
insufficiency of evidence on records. At any rate, the tax-exempt status
 of a government instrumentality is not lost when it grants the 
beneficial use of its real property to a taxable person; only the 
exemption of the real property ceases in such case. The LGC also leaves 
no room for interpretation on the corresponding liability of the taxable
 beneficial user for the payment of real property taxes on a government 
instrumentality property.
[50]
 Section 205(d) of the LGC provides:


SEC. 205. Listing of Real Property in the Assessment Rolls. - x x x


x x x x



(d) 
Real property owned by
 the Republic of the Philippines, 
its instrumentalities
 and political subdivisions, 
the
 beneficial use of which has been granted, for consideration or 
otherwise, to a taxable person, shall be listed, valued and assessed in 
the name of the possessor, grantee
, or of the public entity if such property has been acquired or held for resale or lease.
[51]
 (Emphasis supplied.)





 
 


Indeed, it is a fundamental principle in real property taxation that the
 assessment of real property shall be based on its actual use.
[52]

 The Court has consistently ruled that while the liability for taxes 
generally rests on the owner of the real property, personal liability 
for real property taxes may also expressly rest on the entity with the 
beneficial use of the real property at the time the tax accrues.
[53]
 In as early as 1980 in the case of 
City of Baguio v. Busuego
,
[54]

 we ruled that the taxable person who purchased in installment the 
property belonging to a tax-exempt person was held liable to pay the 
real property taxes from the time the possession of the property was 
transferred to him despite such tax-exempt person's retention of 
ownership and title over the property pending full payment of the 
purchase price.
[55]
 This ruling was made more explicit in the case of 
National Power Corp. v. Province of Quezon
:
[56]


The liability for taxes generally rests on the owner of the 
real property owner at the time the tax accrues. This is a necessary 
consequence that proceeds from the fact of ownership. However, personal 
liability for realty taxes may also expressly rest on the entity with 
the beneficial use of the real property, such as the tax on property 
owned by the government but leased to private persons or entities, or 
when the tax assessment is made on the basis of the actual use of the 
property. 
In either case, the unpaid realty tax attaches to the property but is directly chargeable against the taxable person who has 
actual and beneficial use and possession
 of the property regardless of whether or not that person is the owner.
[57]
 (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted.)




In sum, we hold that MWSS is not liable to the local government of Pasay
 City for real property taxes. The tax exemption of its properties, 
however, ceases when the beneficial or actual use is alleged and proven 
to have been extended to a taxable person. All the assessments issued in
 the name of MWSS should thus, be declared void. To be clear, Pasay City
 is not precluded from availing of the appropriate remedies under the 
law to assess and collect real property taxes from the private entities 
to whom MWSS may have granted the beneficial use of its properties.








MWSS' claim for refund of real property taxes erroneously paid will not automatically issue.


 







As the real property tax assessments issued in the name of MWSS are 
declared void, MWSS's claim for refund of the real property taxes 
erroneously paid based on void assessments cannot be ignored. This 
entitlement to a tax refund, however, is not automatic. The amount is a 
factual matter that must be threshed out with certainty in the normal 
course and in accordance with the administrative procedure provided 
under the LGC.
[58]





Section 253 of the LGC provides for the procedure in claiming for real property tax refund:


SEC. 253. Repayment of Excessive Collections. - When an 
assessment of basic real property tax, or any other tax levied under 
this Title, is found to be illegal or erroneous and the tax is 
accordingly reduced or adjusted, the taxpayer may file a written claim 
for refund or credit for taxes and interests with the provincial or city
 treasurer within two (2) years from the date the taxpayer is entitled 
to such reduction or adjustment.


The provincial or city treasurer shall decide the claim for tax refund 
or credit within sixty (60) days from receipt thereof. In case the claim
 for tax refund or credit is denied, the taxpayer may avail of the 
remedies as provided in Chapter 3, Title II, Book II of this Code.




MWSS's claim for tax refund should, therefore, be filed with the city 
treasurer within two years from the finality of this Decision, as it is 
only then that the invalidity of the Pasay City assessment is finally 
settled.


FOR THESE REASONS
, the petition is 
PARTLY GRANTED
. The Resolutions dated June 3, 2014 and December 11, 2014 in CA-G.R. SP No. 129182 are 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
. The real properties of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System located in Pasay City are 
DECLARED EXEMPT
 from real property tax, 
EXCEPT

 when their beneficial use is alleged and proved to have been granted to
 taxable entities. All the real property tax assessments and 
computations issued in the name of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage 
System are 
DECLARED VOID
.






 


The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System's claim for refund may 
be pursued in accordance with Section 253 of the Local Government Code 
of 1991 within two years from the finality of this Decision.
