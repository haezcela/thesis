RONNIE L. SINGSON, PETITIONER, VS. ARKTIS MARITIME CORP./FILPRIDE SHIPPING, CO., INC./PROSPER MARINE PRIVATE LTD., RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




HERNANDO, J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 seeks to set aside the May 31, 2013 Decision,
[2]
 and August 15, 2014 Resolution
[3]

 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 07134 denying petitioner
 Ronnie Singson's (Ronnie) claim for permanent and total disability 
benefits.

 
Antecedent Facts:
 


On January 13, 2010, respondent Fil-Pride Shipping Co. (Fil-Pride), 
for and in behalf of its foreign principal, respondent Prosper Marine 
Private Ltd. (Prosper)
[4]
 hired Ronnie as "third engineer officer" on board the vessel "MIT Atlanta 2" for a period of 10 months.
[5]


 Ronnie boarded the vessel on January 20, 2010 and commenced his employment.
[6]
 Concurrently, Fil-Pride was replaced by Arktis Maritime Corp. (Arktis) as the new manning agent of Prosper.
[7]


 On October 13, 2010, petitioner complained of severe stomach pains 
and was confined at the Citymed Hospital in Singapore. On October 14, 
2010, Dr. Noel Yao, petitioner's attending physician, declared him to be
 fit to rejoin the vessel with rest on board for three more days.
[8]
 When his condition did not improve, petitioner was recommended for repatriation.


 He arrived in Manila on October 17, 2010.
[9]
 The following day, he was referred for a medical check-up at the company's accredited clinic, Christian Medical Clinic, Inc.
[10]

 The company physician, Dr. Lyn C. de Leon (Dr. de Leon), diagnosed 
petitioner as suffering from "cholecystlithiasis and r/o pancreatic 
pseudo cyst," with a recommendation for surgery.
[11]
 


About four months later, or exactly 134 days from petitioner's 
arrival in Manila, he again underwent an examination. This time, he was 
declared by Dr. de Leon as "fit to work" in the Medical Report dated 
February 28, 2011.
[12]
 


On September 12, 2011, petitioner filed a complaint against 
respondents Arktis, Fil-Pride, and Prosper for the payment of his 
disability benefits, sickness allowance, refund of medical expenses, as 
well as damages and attorney's fees.
[13]


 Petitioner alleged that after he was diagnosed with the disease and recommended for surgery, Arktis took no action on the same.
[14]
 Consequently, he consulted Dr. Villanueva who recommended that he undergo an operation.
[15]

 Due to Arktis' inaction, petitioner claimed that he was forced to 
undertake medication at his own expense without receiving any assistance
 from the respondents.
[16]
 He 
further alleged that Arlctis denied him his sickness and medical 
benefits and failed to give him an assessment of his disability.
[17]

 Considering that he contracted the illness during the term of his 
employment contract, he maintained that his illness was work-related.
[18]


 Moreover, petitioner argued that for more than a year since his 
medical repatriation on October 17, 2010, he has been unable to resume 
work as a seafarer and there has been no finding or declaration from the
 companyÂ­designated physician regarding his disability.
[19]

 Consequently, he prayed for payment of permanent and total disability 
benefits, the refund of his medical expenses, damages and attorney's 
fees.
[20]


 On the other hand, respondents alleged that petitioner was no longer
 in their employ after the latter voluntarily disembarked from "MIT/ 
Atlanta 2" on October 17, 2010.
[21]

 In the absence of an employment relationship between the parties, 
respondents claimed that no liability should attach to them especially 
since petitioner himself freely executed a letter of appreciation in 
favor of the company.
[22]
 Respondents also stressed that petitioner was already declared as fit to work by the company physician.
[23]


Ruling of the Labor Arbiter (Arbiter):


 The Arbiter granted
[24]
 petitioner's claim for disability benefits, as follows: 


WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondents ARKTIS MARITIME 
CORPORATION, FIL-PRIDE SHIPPING COMPANY, INC. AND PROSPER MARINE PRlVATE
 LTD., are hereby Ordered to pay complainant jointly and solidarily the 
following amounts:


 
 
1. Full Disability Benefits 
 
-
 
US$60,000.00 
 
 
 
2. Sickness Allowance 
 
-
 
US$3964.00
 
 
 
3. Refund of Medical Expenses 
 
- 
 
P9,396.00
 
 
 
4. Moral Damages 
 
-
 
US$10,000.00
 
 
 
5. Exemplary Damages 
 
-
 
US$5,000.00
 
 
 
6. Attorney's Fees (10% of the total monetary awards) 
 
 


The awards in U.S. Dollars are convertible to Philippine Currency on the date of actual payment.



The rest of the claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED.
[25]


Ruling of the National Labor 

Relations Commission:


 
 Aggrieved, respondents filed an appeal with the NLRC by submitting their Memorandum of Appeal
[26]
 and attaching a Motion to Reduce Bond and Admit Surety Bond
[27]
 in the amount of P800,000. However, the NLRC dismissed their appeal in its March 15, 2012 Resolution
[28]
 on the ground that it was filed out of time. Consequently, it denied their motion to reduce the appeal bond.
[29]
 


Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration insisting on the 
timeliness of their appeal as shown by the registry return receipts and 
the affidavit of the person who served the registered mail, and the 
certification from the postmaster.
[30]


 On August 23, 2012, the NLRC issued a Resolution
[31]

 holding that the appeal was indeed filed on time, as posited by 
respondents. Nevertheless, the NLRC resolved the respondents' Motion for
 Reconsideration in this wise:




In the instant case, We do not find merit in respondents' request to be allowed to post a reduced cash bond.



x x x x



In the instant case, We do not find any grave abuse of discretion on 
the part of the Labor Arbiter when he found for complainant and when he 
cited the case of the 
Heirs of the Late Radio Operator Reynaldo Aniban v. NLRC
.
 The Labor Arbiter also correctly awarded complainant full disability 
benefits, sickness allowance, damages and attorney's fees. 


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, respondent's motion for reconsideration is DENIED and their appeal DISMISSED. 


SO ORDERED.
[32]




Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
 


Aggrieved, Arktis filed a Petition
[33]
 for 
Certiorari

 imputing grave abuse of discretion on the NLRC in denying their motion 
for reconsideration and dismissing their appeal. Moreover, the monetary 
awards in favor of petitioner were baseless considering that 
petitioner's illness was not work-related.


In its assailed May 31, 2013 Decision,
[34]

 the appellate court reversed the ruling of the NLRC. It found 
petitioner not entitled to permanent and total disability benefits. 
Thefallo of the appellate court's Decision reads: 


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing premises, the 
petition is hereby GRANTED. The assailed Resolutions dated 15 March 2012
 and 23 August 2012 promulgated by the National Labor Relations 
Commission Seventh Division in Cebu City in NLRC Case No. OFW 
VAC-02-000008-2012 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. A new judgment is 
accordingly rendered ordering Arlctis, Fil-Pride and Prosper to jointly 
and severally pay Singson the following amounts:


1) sickness allowance equivalent to Singson's basic wage 
corresponding to the 134 days he was unable to work amounting to 
US$4426.47;


2) refund of Singson's medical expenses amounting to Php9,396;


3) moral damages of Php30,000;


4) exemplary damages of Php20,000;


5) attorney's fees of Php20,000. 


SO ORDERED
.
[35]


Dissatisfied, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[36]
 but it was denied by the appellate court in its August 15, 2014 Resolution.
[37]


Hence, the instant Petition raising the sole -


Issue 


Whether or not the CA committed serious errors of law in ruling that he 
is not entitled to the award of total and permanent disability benefits.
[38]


Our Ruling 


The Petition is denied. 


The mere lapse of the 120-day period

under Article 198(c)(l) of the Labor

Code does not automatically give rise

to a cause of action for a claim of

permanent total disability benefits.
 


 To determine whether or not an error of law was committed, we must 
first examine what the applicable law actually says. Relevantly, how 
"permanent total disability" is defined under the law is of utmost 
importance to the resolution of sole issue in this petition. Article 198
 (formerly Article 192) of the Labor Code, as amended, defines 
"permanent total disability" as follows: 


Article 198. [192] 
Permanent total disability
. - x x x 


x x x x 


 
 
(c)
 
The following disabilities shall be deemed total and permanent:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
Temporary
 total disability lasting continuously for more than one hundred twenty 
days, except as otherwise provided for in the Rules; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)


 
Complete loss of sight of both eyes;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) 
 
Loss of two limbs at or above the ankle or wrist;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4)


 
Permanent complete paralysis of two limbs;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
 
Brain injury resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
 
Such cases as determined by the Medical Director of the System and approved by the Commission.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d) 
 
The number of months of paid coverage shall be
 defined and approximated by a formula to be approved by the Commission.
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 


Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc.(Vergara)
[39]

 clearly clarifies that the qualifying phrase "except as otherwise 
provided in the Rules" quoted above means those rules adopted to 
implement the provisions of the Labor Code, to wit:


In this respect and in the context of the present case, Article 192(c)(1) of the Labor Code provides that:


 x x x The following disabilities shall be deemed
 total and permanent
:


 (1) Temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than one hundred twenty days, 
except as otherwise provided in the Rules
;


x x x


The rule referred to - Rule X, Section 2 of the Rules and Regulations implementing Book IV of the Labor Code- states:


 Period of entitlement. - (a) The income benefit shall be paid 
beginning on the first day of such disability. If caused by an injury or
 sickness it shall not be paid longer than 120 consecutive days 
except
 where such injury or sickness still requires medical attendance beyond 
120 days but not to exceed 240 days from onset of disability in which 
case 
benefit for temporary total disability
 shall be paid. 
However, the System may declare the total and permanent status at any 
time after 120 days of continuous temporary total disability as may be 
warranted by the degree of actual loss or impairment of physical or 
mental functions as determined by the System
.


These provisions are to be read hand in hand with the POEA Standard Employment Contract whose Section 20 (3) states: 


Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the 
seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage 
until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability 
has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case 
shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.


As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off from his 
vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within three (3)
 days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the duration of the 
treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman is on temporary 
total disability as he is totally unable to work. He receives his basic 
wage during this period until he is declared fit to work or his 
temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, 
either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA 
Standard Employment Contract and by applicable Philippine laws. If the 
120 days initial period is exceeded and no such declaration is made 
because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the 
temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240
 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this 
period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists. The 
seaman may of course also be declared fit to work at any time such 
declaration is justified by his medical condition.
[40]
 (Underscoring in the original)


Indeed, the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation (AREC), as 
adopted by the Employees Compensation Commission, provides for an
 exception to the general rule provided by Article 192. Rule X, Section 
2(a) of the AREC expressly provides thus: 


Section 2. 
Period of entitlement
. - (a) The income 
benefit shall be paid beginning on the first day of such disability. If 
caused by an injury or sickness it shall not be paid longer than 120 
consecutive days 
except where such injury or sickness still requires 
medical attendance beyond 120 days but not to exceed 240 davs from onset
 of disability
 in which case benefit for temporary total disability 
shall be paid. However, the System may declare the total and permanent 
status at any time after 120 days of continuous temporary total 
disability as may be warranted by the degree of actual loss or 
impairment of physical or mental functions as determined by the System. 
(Underscoring supplied)


The above provision must be read with Section 1(b), Rule XI of the same AREC, which provides:


(b) The following total disabilities shall be considered permanent:


(1) Temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than 120 days, except as otherwise provided for in Rule X hereof. 


(2) Complete loss of sight of both eyes;


(3) Loss of two limbs at or above the ankle or wrist;


(4) Permanent complete paralysis of two limbs.


(5) Brain injury resulting in incurable imbecility and insanity, and


(6) Such cases as determined by the System and approved by the Commission. (Underscoring supplied) 


The AREC thus carved out an exception for situations wherein such injury
 or sickness causing temporary total disability still requires medical 
attendance beyond 120 days but not to exceed 240 days from the onset of 
disability. In such situations, the benefits for temporary total 
disability shall be paid. As an exception to this exception, the rule 
provides that the System (GSIS or SSS, whichever is applicable) may 
declare the total and permanent status at any time after 120 days of 
continuous temporary total disability as may be warranted by the degree 
of actual loss or impairment of physical or mental functions. This was 
also explained in 
Vergara
 where it was held that:


As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off 
from his vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within 
three (3) days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the 
duration of the treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman 
is on temporary total disability as he is totally unable to work. He 
receives his basic wage during this period until he is declared fit to 
work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be 
permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined 
under the POEA Standard Employment Contract and by applicable Philippine
 laws. 
If the 120 days initial period is exceeded and no such 
declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical 
attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up
 to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to 
declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability 
already exists. The seaman may of course also be declared fit to work at
 any time such declaration is justified by his medical condition
.
[41]


(Underscoring supplied)


In 
C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Taok
,
[42]
 we have further distilled the principles laid down in 
Vergara

 and clearly set out the conditions when an action for total and 
permanent disability may prosper. These conditions were reiterated in 
Daraug v. KGJS Fleet Management Manila, Inc.
[43]
 as follows:


Actually, petitioner's filing of his claim was premature.
 The Court has held that a seafarer may have basis to pursue an action 
for total and permanent disability benefits, if any of the following 
conditions are present:



(a) The company-designated physician failed to issue a declaration as
 to his fitness to engage in sea duty or disability even after the lapse
 of the 120-day period and there is no indication that further medical 
treatment would address his temporary total disability, hence, justify 
an extension of the period to 240 days;



(b) 240 days had lapsed without any certification issued by the company designated physician;



(c) The company-designated physician declared that he is fit for sea 
duty within the 120-day or 240-day period, as the case may be, but his 
physician of choice and the doctor chosen under Section 20 B(3) of the 
POEA-SEC are of a contrary opinion;



(d) The company-designated physician acknowledged that he is 
partially permanently disabled but other doctors who he consulted, on 
his own and jointly with his employer, believed that his disability is 
not only permanent but total as well;



(e) The company-designated physician recognized that he is totally 
and permanently disabled but there is a dispute on the disability 
grading;


 (f) The company-designated physician determined that his medical 
condition is not compensable or work-related under the POEA-SEC but his 
doctor-of-choice and the third doctor selected under Section 20-B(3) of 
the POEA-SEC found otherwise and declared him unfit to work;



(g) The company-designated physician declared him totally and 
permanently disabled but the employer refuses to pay him the 
corresponding benefits; and



(h) The company-designated physician declared him partially and 
permanently disabled within the 120-day or 240-day period but he remains
 incapacitated to perform his usual sea duties after the lapse of said 
periods.
[44]




To be clear, when a certain sickness or injury causes a temporary and
 total disability which lasts continuously for more than 120 days, then 
such total disability is considered to be permanent. However, as an 
exception to this rule, if the said sickness or injury that caused the 
temporary total disability 
requires medical treatment beyond the 120-day period but not to exceed 240 days
,
 then the employee is only entitled to temporary total disability 
benefits until he is declared as either: 1) "fit to work," which stops 
his entitlement to disability benefits; or 2) "permanently and totally 
disabled," which then entitles him to permanent total disability 
benefits. In any event, if the 240 days had lapsed without any 
certification issued by the companyÂ­designated doctor, then the employee
 may pursue an action for permanent total disability benefits.


With the above principles in mind, we must now determine whether the CA correctly applied the same to the present case. 


The appellate court did not commit

any error of law when it ruled that

petitioner is not entitled to total and

permanent disability benefits. 
 


The CA applied in this case the principles in 
Vergara
 since the factual milieu involved is similar.
[45]

 It held that petitioner was not entitled to permanent total disability 
benefits but only to temporary disability benefits until the time he was
 declared fit to work by the company physician, Dr. de Leon.
[46]
 


Petitioner, however, claims that the appellate court's Decision is 
erroneous. The fact that he still had to undergo surgery even after the 
company doctor's fit-to-work declaration clearly shows that he was not 
yet fit to work during the time when the said declaration was made.
[47]
 He then cited the case of 
Crystal Shipping v. Natividad (Crystal Shipping)
[48]
 and other related jurisprudence to support his claim.


 Petitioner's arguments clearly have no merit.


 
Petitioner failed to prove that the

company physician issued the fit to

work certification dated February 28,

2011 in bad faith.
 


Petitioner's mere allegation of bad faith cannot prevail over a 
medical certificate issued and signed by a duly licensed physician. Such
 medical certificates, even if unnotarized, bear all the earmarks of 
regularity in their issuance and are entitled to full probative weight.
[49]


 He who alleges must prove.
[50]
 Petitioner's imputations of bad faith must be duly proven.
[51]

 In this case, he utterly failed to discharge this burden of proof when 
he merely alleged possible ulterior motives behind the company 
physician's certification, without presenting proof to support such 
allegations. Simply put, petitioner's allegations discrediting the 
medical certificate issued by Dr. de Leon on February 28, 2011 cannot be
 given any weight as there is nothing on record to support the same. 


A recommendation to undergo

surgery does not necessarily prove

that petitioner was not fit to work.

Rather, such recommendation merely

proves that further medical

treatment is needed.
 


We cannot subscribe to petitioner's argument that the fit-to-work 
declaration was "absurd" since he still had to undergo surgery even 
after such declaration was made; the recommendation for surgery does not
 necessarily mean that petitioner is still not fit to work.


A person with a disease may be asymptomatic; he/she may not be 
showing symptoms of the disease. While still stricken by the disease, 
he/she may not even be aware of it, or even if he/she is aware of such 
disease, he/she may continue to function without impairment.


In this case, it is entirely possible that petitioner, while still 
afflicted with a disease, was not manifesting any symptoms, or that such
 symptoms were already managed in such a way that they did not manifest 
anymore. Thus, when he was examined by Dr. de Leon, it is possible that 
the latter might have determined that the disease that petitioner was 
diagnosed with had no notable effect on his fitness to work. Indeed, the
 mere presence of a disease is not necessarily a disability. 


The Crystal Shipping case and its

related line of cases do not apply to

the factual circumstances of the

present case.


 Finally, 
Crystal Shipping
 is not on all fours with the present case. In Crystal Shipping, the employee-respondent therein 
was never declared to be fit to work

 by any of the doctors involved in said case, and the primary issue was 
merely the grading or degree of disability employee-respondent therein 
suffered.
[52]
 On the other hand, the instant petition presents to us a situation wherein 
petitioner was expressly declared to be asymptomatic and fit to work
.
[53]
 


We have already explained in 
Vergara
 that several considerations must be taken into account when citing the same 
Crystal Shipping
 case, to wit: 


As a last point, the petitioner has repeatedly invoked 
our ruling in Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad, apparently for its 
statement that the respondent in the case "was unable to perform his 
customary work for more than 120 days which constitutes permanent total 
disability." 
This declaration of a permanent total disabilitv after 
the initial 120 days of temporary total disability cannot. however, be 
simply lifted and applied as a general rule for all cases in all 
contexts. The specific context of the application should be considered, 
as we must do in the application of all rulings and even of the law and 
of the implementing regulations
.


 Crystal Shipping was a case where the seafarer was completely unable
 to work for three years and was undisputably unfit for sea duty "due to
 respondent's need for regular medical check-up and treatment which 
would not be available if he were at sea." While the case was not clear 
on how the initial 120-day and subsequent temporary total disability 
period operated, 
what appears clear is that the disability went beyond 240 days without any declaration that the seafarer was fit to resume work
.
 Under the circumstances, a ruling of permanent and total disability was
 called for, fully in accordance with the operation of the period for 
entitlement that we described above. Viewed from this perspective, the 
petitioner caunot cite the Crystal Shipping ruling as basis for his 
claim for permanent total disability.


Additionally and to reiterate what we pointed out above regarding the
 governing rules that affect the disability of Filipino seafarers in 
ocean-going vessels, the POEA Standard Employment Contract provides its 
own Schedule of Disability or Impediment for Injuries Suffered and 
Diseases Including Occupational Diseases or Illness Contracted (Section 
32); Disability Allowances (a subpart of Section 32); and its own 
guidelines on Occupational Diseases (Section 32-A) which caunot be 
disregarded in considering disability compensation and benefits. 
All 
these - read in relation with applicable Philippine laws and rules - 
should also be taken into account in considering and citing Crystal 
Shipping and its related line of cases as authorities
.
[54]
 (Underscoring supplied).


As applied in the instant case, the records show that there was no 
declaration as to petitioner's fitness to work or as to the permanent 
and total status of his disability within the 120-day period. However, 
since petitioner's sickness required medical treatment beyond the 
120-day period, the temporary total disability period was extended up to
 a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of his employer to declare 
within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already 
exists. In this connection, petitioner never presented any declaration 
to the effect that his disability is total and permanent.

On the contrary, the evidence on record would reveal that 
petitioner 
was declared as asymptomatic and fit to work on Februarv 28, 2011 or one
 hundred thirty-four (134) days after the onset of the disability
, 
well within the 240-day period. Therefore, petitioner cannot claim 
permanent total disability benefits and is only entitled to temporary 
total disability benefits until the time when he was declared to be fit 
to work. 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED
. The May 31, 2013 Decision and August 15, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 07134 are 
AFFIRMED
