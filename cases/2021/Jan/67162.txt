SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 205725, January 18, 2021 ]


MARCELO M. CORPUZ, JR., PETITIONER, VS. GERWIL CREWING PHILS., INC., RESPONDENT.
DECISION




GESMUNDO, J.:


Licensed recruitment agencies are subject to a continuing liability to 
ensure the welfare of the Filipino workers they deployed abroad. Their 
carelessness and wanton disregard of such responsibility that result to 
the substitution of employment contracts previously approved by the 
Department of Labor and Employment (
DOLE
), through the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (
POEA
), shall render them liable for damages.


The Case



We resolve this appeal by 
certiorari
 seeking to reverse and set aside the September 28, 2012 Decision
[1]
 and January 30, 2013 Resolution
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
) in CA-G.R. SP No. 120720, which affirmed the March 30, 2011 Decision
[3]
 and May 30, 2011 Resolution
[4]
 of the National Labor Relations Commission (
NLRC
) in NLRC LAC No. 10-000818-10. The NLRC decision reversed and set aside the September 11, 2010 Decision
[5]
 of the Labor Arbiter (
LA
) that granted petitioner's claim for disability benefits.


Antecedents



Gerwil Crewing Phils., Inc. (
respondent
) recruited Marcelo M. Corpuz, Jr. (
petitioner
) to work as an Able Seaman for a period of twelve (12) months with Echo Cargo & Shipping LLC on board the vessel 
MT Azarakhsh
,
[6]
 with a monthly salary of Four Hundred Sixty-One Dollars ($461.00).
[7]
 Respondent deployed petitioner on August 5, 2008.
[8]



On May 17, 2009, petitioner was brought to the Sheik Khalifa Medical 
City in the United Arab Emirates due to severe headache and vomiting 
after he allegedly sustained a fall while lifting heavy motor parts on 
board the vessel. He experienced an episodic low back pain radiating to 
his left posterior thigh accompanied by severe pain of the foot. This 
caused him to slip, hitting his chest first, followed by his head. The 
diagnosis revealed that he suffered from 
Left Cerebellar Hemorrhage with Intraventricular Hematoma
. Aside from the medications given, he underwent an external ventricular drain (
EVD
)
 to relieve his hydrocephalus. Petitioner was eventually recommended for
 repatriation to undergo further evaluation and treatment.
[9]



On September 9, 2009, petitioner arrived in Manila on a wheelchair. 
Petitioner claims to have reported to the office of respondent the next 
day. However, respondent's Chief Executive Officer (
CEO
), Rommel S. Valdez (
Valdez
),
 denied his request for medical assistance on the ground that his 
illness was not work-related. Valdez also allegedly humiliated him in 
front of the people present in the agency.
[10]









 
 




Consequently, petitioner sought medical consultation with Dr. Nune Babao-Balgomera (
Dr. Balgomera
),
 a neurologist at Sta. Rosa Medical Center. On October 28, 2009, Dr. 
Balgomera issued a medical certificate declaring petitioner as 
permanently unfit for sea duty in any capacity and suffering from 
Severe Complex Cerebral Function Disturbance
 or 
Post Traumatic Psychoneurosis
. Dr. Balgomera classified petitioner's illness as a Grade I disability.
[11]



Petitioner also consulted Dr. Donald S. Camero (Dr. Camero), an 
internist, who also gave an assessment of POEA Disability Grade I. Armed
 with both medical assessments, petitioner demanded payment of 
disability benefits from respondent to no avail.
[12]



On April 20, 2010, petitioner instituted a complaint against respondent 
and Valdez for payment of disability benefits, among others.
[13]


Labor Arbiter Ruling



The Labor Arbiter (
LA
) promulgated a Decision on September 11, 2010, disposing as follows:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents to jointly and severally:


Pay complainant permanent disability benefit in the amount of $60,000.00;




Pay complainant sickness allowance in the amount of $1,844.00;




Pay complainant moral and exemplary damages in the total amount of [P300,000.00]; and




Pay complainant attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total award.




SO ORDERED.
[14]











 
 




The LA based his decision solely on the evidence submitted by petitioner
 in view of respondent's failure to file a position paper. The LA held 
that since respondent refused to provide petitioner with medical 
attendance, the latter was justified in consulting his own personal 
doctors. Also, both certifications issued by Dr. Balgomera and Dr. 
Camero showed that petitioner's injury was related to his exposure to 
toxic and hazardous materials.
[15]



Aggrieved, respondent appealed to the NLRC.


NLRC Ruling



On March 30, 2011, the NLRC reversed the decision of the LA and dismissed petitioner's complaint for lack of merit.
[16]
 The NLRC noted that based on petitioner's logbook, petitioner did not report to the agency on September 10, 2009.
[17]
 Petitioner's failure to report upon repatriation was fatal to his claim for disability benefits.




The NLRC also held that petitioner failed to prove that his injury was 
work-related. As an Able Seaman, petitioner's duties were confined only 
to deck and navigational work and did not include lifting of motor 
parts. Furthermore, the medical certificates submitted by petitioner 
failed to establish that the injury he sustained was work-related 
because his doctors readily concluded that he had been exposed to 
hazardous materials, although the evidence on record did not support 
such finding.
[18]



Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which the NLRC denied in its May 30, 2011 Resolution.
[19]
 Unsatisfied, petitioner filed a petition for 
certiorari
 before the CA.


CA Ruling



In the now assailed decision, the CA dismissed the petition for 
certiorari

 for lack of merit. It agreed with the NLRC that petitioner was not 
entitled to disability compensation and other benefits due to his 
failure to comply with the compulsory examination upon repatriation. It 
noted that petitioner's name did not appear in respondent's visitor 
logbook for the period of September 4, 2009 to October 6, 2009. The NLRC
 also held that petitioner failed to submit evidence to support his 
claim that his disability was work-related.
[20]




Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied in its January 30, 2013 Resolution.



Hence, this petition.


Issue



Petitioner attributes the sole error on the part of the CA:


WHETHER OR NOT THE NLRC (FIRST DIVISION) AND THE HONORABLE 
COURT OF APPEALS (FOURTEENTH DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF 
DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN RENDERING THE 
ASSAILED DECISIONS AND DENIED RESOLUTIONS.
[21]




Petitioner points to two (2) procedural defects in respondent's appeal 
before the NLRC: (1) that the appeal was filed out of time because 
respondent received a copy of the LA Decision on September 30, 2010 but 
filed the notice of appeal only on October 11, 2010; and (2) that 
respondent did not post a cash or surety bond.
[22]



He also argues that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in 
reversing the LA decision and denying his claim for Grade 1 disability 
benefits and attorney's fees. Based on his medical histories, records 
and physician's reports, the working conditions at 
MT Azarakhsh
 increased his risk of contracting 
Severe Complex Cerebral Function Disturbance
.
[23]
 Considering that his injury arose out of the occupational conditions on board 
MT Azarakhsh
, he should be entitled to disability compensation.
[24]



Finally, petitioner maintains that he has the prerogative to consult a 
physician of his choice. Hence, the CA and the NLRC erred in ruling that
 the company-designated physician is the sole authority to determine the
 degree of disability of an ailing seafarer.
[25]



The Court resolved to require respondent to comment on the petition in its June 19, 2013 Resolution.
[26]
 Despite such notice, respondent failed to file its comment. Hence, on March 3, 2014, the Court issued a Resolution
[27]
 requiring Atty. Robertson R. Aquino (
Atty. Aquino
)
 of Atienza Madrid and Formento, to file a comment and to show cause why
 he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt. Noting 
that respondent's counsel again failed to comply with the prior 
resolutions, the Court resolved on December 10, 2014 to impose upon 
Atty. Aquino a fine of P1,000.00 and to file a comment.
[28]
 Respondent counsel's failure to comply with said resolution prompted the Court to issue another Resolution on January 11, 2016
[29]

 imposing an additional fine of P1,000.00 on Atty. Aquino. Respondent's 
counsel once again failed to comply with the prior resolutions, and the 
Court resolved to impose on him another additional fine of P1,000.00.
[30]





In view of the several notices sent to respondent to file the required 
comment which remained unheeded, the Court deems it proper to dispense 
with the filing of the same and to proceed with the resolution of the 
instant petition.


Our Ruling



The petition is partially meritorious.






Respondent's appeal before the NLRC is not procedurally infirm


 







Petitioner insists that respondent's appeal before the NLRC was 
defective because it was filed beyond the reglementary period and was 
not accompanied by a cash or surety bond.



We find the above claim to have no basis both in fact and in law.










Section 1, Rule VI of the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure of the NLRC, 
the applicable rule at the time that respondent filed its appeal, reads:


Section 1. 
Periods of Appeal
. - Decisions, 
resolutions or orders of the Labor Arbiter shall be final and executory 
unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10)
 calendar days from receipt thereof; and in case of decisions, 
resolutions or orders of the Regional Director of the Department of 
Labor and Employment pursuant to Article 129 of the Labor Code, within 
five (5) calendar days from receipt thereof. 
If the 10th or 5th day, 
as the case may be, falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the last day
 to perfect the appeal shall be the first working day following such 
Saturday, Sunday or holiday.


x x x x (emphasis supplied)




Respondent received a copy of the LA Decision on September 30, 2010 and 
therefore had until October 10, 2010 to file an appeal to the same. 
Since October 10, 2010 fell on a Sunday, it had until October 11, 2010 
to file its appeal. Hence, respondent submitted its appeal within the 
reglementary period.



As regards respondent's alleged failure to secure a bond, We find the 
same to be without basis. The records show that it had secured a 
supersedeas

 bond covering the monetary award from CAP General Insurance Corporation
 to which the latter issued CGI Bond No. JCL (15) 00001/00242.
[31]
 Accordingly, respondent had perfected its appeal before the NLRC.






Petitioner is not entitled to 
disability benefits; Failure to submit to postÂ­employment medical 
examination was fatal to his cause




 







The main thrust of the instant petition anchors on petitioner's claim 
for disability benefits. As the one claiming entitlement to benefits 
under the law, petitioner must establish his right thereto by 
substantial evidence.
[32]



Petitioner's right to receive disability benefits is determined by his 
employment contract. Deemed written in his contract is a set of standard
 provisions established and implemented by the POEA called the 
Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels
, which are the mm1mum requirements acceptable to the government for the employment of Filipino seafarers.
[33]
 In petitioner's case, the 2000 POEA Standard Employment Contract (
2000 POEA-SEC
) governs his relationship with respondent.



Under the 2000 POEA-SEC, two elements must concur for an injury or illness to be compensable. 
First
, the injury or illness must be workÂ­related; and 
second
, the work-related injury or illness must have existed during the term of the seafarer's employment contract.
[34]

 Paragraph 3, Sec. 20(8) of the same contract also requires him to 
submit to a post-employment medical examination within three (3) days 
from repatriation, 
viz
.:


3. Upon sign off from the vessel for medical treatment, the 
seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage 
until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability 
has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case 
shall this period exceed one-hundred twenty (120) days.



For this purpose, 
the seafarer shall submit himself to a postÂ­ 
employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within 
three working days upon his return
 except when he is physically 
incapacitated to do so, in which case a written notice to the agency 
within the same period is deemed as compliance. 
Failure of the 
seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result
 in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.





If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a 
third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the 
seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both
 parties. (emphases and underscoring supplied)


Dionio v. ND Shipping Agency and Allied Services, Inc.
[35]

 succinctly laid down the rules relating to the mandatory 
post-employment medical examination under paragraph 3, Sec. 20 as 
follows:


[A] seafarer claiming disability benefits is required to 
submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a 
companyÂ­ designated physician within three (3) working days from 
repatriation. 
Failure to comply with such requirement results in the forfeiture of the seafarer's claim for disability benefits.

 There are, however, exceptions to the rule: (1) when the seafarer is 
incapacitated to report to the employer upon his repatriation; and (2) 
when the employer inadvertently or deliberately refused to submit the 
seafarer to a postÂ­ employment medical examination by a 
company-designated physician. Moreover, 
it is the burden of the employer to prove that the seafarer was referred to a company-designated doctor
.
[36]
 (emphases supplied; citation omitted)




Herein petitioner claims that he went to respondent's office on 
September 10, 2009, the day following his repatriation, but respondent, 
through CEO Valdez, refused to refer him to the company-designated 
physician.



We are unconvinced.



While the rule vests in the employer the burden to prove that the 
seafarer was referred to the company-designated physician for a postÂ­ 
employment examination, the same presupposes that the seafarer had first
 reported to the employer's office.



In here, respondent submitted copies of its visitor logbook to disprove 
petitioner's claim that he visited their office immediately after his 
repatriation. Notable that petitioner's name does not appear in the 
entries of said logbook from September 4, 2009 until October 6, 2009.
[37]

 Faced with this evidence, petitioner remained silent and did not rebut 
or address the same in his pleadings. Between petitioner's bare and 
unsupported allegations and the documentary evidence submitted by 
respondents, We are more inclined to accord weight to the latter. Thus, 
We find petitioner's failure to comply with the mandatory 
post-employment medical examination to be due to his own omission and 
not through respondent's fault.



In this regard, We likewise reject petitioner's assertion that he has the prerogative to consult a physician of his choice. In 
Coastal Safeway Marine Services, Inc. v. Esguerra
,
[38]

 We explained that despite having a choice to consult his own doctor for
 a second opinion, the seafarer still has to comply with the three-day 
mandatory post-employment medical examination, thus:


[Section 20-B(3) of the 2000 POEA-SEC] has been interpreted 
to mean that it is the company-designated physician who is entrusted 
with the task of assessing the seaman's disability, whether total or 
partial, due to either injury or illness, during the term of the 
latter's employment. Concededly, this does not mean that the assessment 
of said physician is final, binding or conclusive on the claimant, the 
labor tribunal or the courts. Should he be so minded, the seafarer has 
the prerogative to request a second opinion and to consult a physician 
of his choice regarding his ailment or injury, in which case the medical
 report issued by the latter shall be evaluated by the labor tribunal 
and the court, based on its inherent merit. 
For the seaman's claim to
 prosper, however, it is mandatory that he should be examined by a 
company-designated physician within three days from his repatriation. 
Failure to comply with this mandatory reporting requirement without 
justifiable cause shall result in forfeiture of the right to claim the 
compensation and disability benefits provided under the POEA-SEC.
[39]
 (emphasis supplied; citations omitted)



To reiterate, the three-day period from return of the seafarer or 
signÂ­off from the vessel, whether to undergo a post-employment medical 
examination or report the seafarer's physical incapacity, should always 
be complied with to determine whether the injury or illness is 
work-related.
[40]
 Hence, 
petitioner's failure to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement 
resulted in the forfeiture of his right to claim disability benefits and
 proved fatal to his cause.






Respondent is liable to pay moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees




 







While petitioner may have forfeited his right to claim disability 
benefits, We find it proper to award him with moral damages, exemplary 
damages, and attorney's fees.



Sec.18, Article II and Sec. 3, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution 
accord all members of the labor sector, without distinction as to place 
of deployment, full protection of their rights and welfare.
[41]
 Republic Act (
R.A.
) No. 8042 (
The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995
)
 confirms this State policy by declaring that the rights and interest of
 distressed overseas Filipinos, in general, and Filipino migrant 
workers, in particular, documented or undocumented, are adequately 
protected and safeguarded.
[42]

 Evidently, Congress enacted R.A. No. 8042 to institute the policies on 
overseas employment and to establish a higher standard of protection and
 promotion of the welfare of migrant workers.
[43]



One of the safeguards incorporated in R.A. No. 8042 is found in Sec. 10 
which provides for the solidary and continuing liability of recruitment 
agencies against monetary claims of migrant workers. These pecuniary 
claims may arise from employer-employee relationship or by virtue of law
 or contract, and may include claims of overseas workers for damages. 
Sec. 10 reads:


SEC. 10. Money Claims. - Notwithstanding any provision of 
law to the contrary, the Labor Arbiters of the National Labor Relations 
Commission (NLRC) shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction to 
hear and decide, within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of 
the complaint, 
the claims arising out of an employer-employee 
relationship or by virtue of any law or contract involving Filipino 
workers for overseas deployment including claims for actual, moral, 
exemplary and other forms of damages
.


The liability of the principal/employer and the recruitment/placement
 agency for any and all claims under this section shall be joint and 
several.
 This provision shall be incorporated in the contract for 
overseas employment and shall be a condition precedent for its approval.
 The performance bond to be filed by the recruitment/placement agency, 
as provided by law, shall be answerable for all money claims or damages 
that may be awarded to the workers. If the recruitment/placement agency 
is a juridical being, the corporate officers and directors and partners 
as the case may be, shall themselves be jointly and solidarily liable 
with the corporation or partnership for the aforesaid claims and 
damages.




Such liabilities shall continue during the entire period or duration 
of the employment contract and shall not be affected by any 
substitution, amendment or modification made locally or in a foreign 
country of the said contract.

The cases of 
Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission (Interorient)
[44]
 and 
Becmen Service Exporter and Promotion, Inc. v. Spouses Cuaresma (Becmen)
[45]

 affirm the continuing responsibility of recruitment agencies in 
ensuring the welfare and safety of overseas Filipino workers. In 
Interorient
, the Court held that the employer has the obligation to ensure the safe return of a distressed worker.
[46]
 In 
Becmen
,
 the Court stressed that recruitment agencies are expected to extend 
assistance to migrant workers, especially those who are in distress.
[47]
 We explained:


Under Republic Act No. 8042 (R.A. 8042), or the Migrant 
Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, the State shall, at all 
times, uphold the dignity of its citizens whether in country or 
overseas, in general, and Filipino migrant workers, in particular. The 
State shall provide adequate and timely social, economic and legal 
services to Filipino migrant workers. The rights and interest of 
distressed overseas Filipinos, in general, and Filipino migrant workers,
 in particular, documented or undocumented, are adequately protected and
 safeguarded.


x x x x



Thus, more than just recruiting and deploying OFWs to their foreign 
principals, recruitment agencies have equally significant 
responsibilities. In a foreign land where OFWs are likely to encounter 
uneven if not discriminatory treatment from the foreign government, and 
certainly a delayed access to language interpretation, legal aid, and 
the Philippine consulate, the recruitment agencies should be the first 
to come to the rescue of our distressed OFWs since they know the 
employers and the addresses where they are deployed or stationed. 
Upon them lies the primary obligation to protect the rights and ensure the welfare of our OFWs, whether distressed or not.
 Who else is in a better position, if not these recruitment agencies, to render immediate aid to their deployed OFWs abroad?
[48]
 (emphasis supplied; citations omitted)




We also ruled in 
Becmen
 that the acts and omissions of the 
foreign principal and the recruitment agencies on the plight of the 
migrant workers and their families ran against public policy. Their 
indifference undermined and subverted the interest and general welfare 
of our Filipino workers abroad who are entitled to full protection under
 the law. As such, they shall be liable to pay moral and exemplary 
damages, as well as attorney's fees.



Verily, R.A. No. 8042 did not limit the responsibility of recruitment 
agencies to the recruitment and deployment of Filipino workers to 
foreign countries. As DOLE-accredited agencies, they entered into a 
covenant with the State to promote the safety and welfare of Filipino 
workers. They have, in fact, undertaken to ensure that the "contracts of
 employment are in accordance with the standard employment contract and 
other applicable laws, regulations and collective bargaining 
agreements."
[49]
 This 
responsibility exists during the lifetime of the employment contract and
 shall continue despite substitution, amendment or modification of the 
agreement.
[50]








 
 




Hence, We turn our attention to the averments made by respondent in its Notice of Appeal with Memorandum of Appeal
[51]
 dated October 11, 2010 before the NLRC. Respondent laid down the following factual antecedents as follows:


Respondents-appellants 
GERWIL CREWING PHILS., INC. and MR. ROMMEL S. VALDEZ, ET AL.
, the former a domestic corporation, are engaged in the business of manning and crewing seafarers.



Complainant-appellee Corpuz was hired as Able Seaman and was deployed 
last August 5, 2009 through respondent agency, Gerwil under the 
principal, Echo Cargo & Shipping LLC, represented by Ms. Rosalie S. 
Cortes.



During that time of hiring and deployment of appellee Corpuz, the 
principal Echo Cargo was under probationary standing with appellant 
Gerwil. The extension of the accreditation of Echo Cargo was not granted
 for its failure to submit the required documents. For which reason, its
 agent Ms. Cortes decided to pull out Echo Cargo with Gerwil and 
transfer the same to other local agencies.



Appellants Gerwil and Valdez have not heard any news from appellee in 
regard to his status on board. In fact, they were never notified about 
the events that transpired until such time that they received a copy of 
the complaint with the NLRC.


x x x x
[52]



Notably, respondent deployed petitioner to work on board 
MT Azarakhsh

 while the foreign principal, Echo Cargo, was under probationary status 
and under an extended accreditation. However, the Court finds it 
disturbing that after petitioner's deployment on August 5, 2008 until 
sometime after the filing of the complaint on April20, 2010, respondent 
did not even have an iota of information regarding his status. It did 
not even attempt or seek out information about the worker that it 
recruited and deployed after the foreign principal failed to complete 
its accreditation. Palpably, this fell short of the agency's 
responsibility to continuously ensure petitioner's welfare and safety 
while deployed overseas.



Respondent's apparent carelessness became more glaring by the details disclosed in the Sea Service Certificate (
certificate
)
[53]
 dated August 13, 2009 presented by petitioner. The certificate showed that petitioner worked with 
Al Mansoori Production Services Co. (LLC)
 as an Oiler on board 
M.V. Alshaheen MPS (DPS2)
, a production well testing and supply vessel, from 
August 6, 2008 to August 10, 2009
.
[54]

 The entries in the certificate, which respondent did not refute, were 
completely different from those in the Contract of Employment

 the Sea Service Certificate readily reveals respondent's overwhelming 
inaction in ensuring the welfare of petitioner. In the POEA-approved 
contract, Echo Cargo appeared as petitioner's foreign employer while the
 certificate referred to a certain Al Mansoori Production Services Co. 
(LLC). Based on the contract, petitioner was recruited as an Able Seaman
 but the certificate showed him to have worked as an Oiler. Even the 
vessel assignment of petitioner appeared to be different. Furthermore, 
petitioner was deployed on August 5, 2008
[58]
 while the certificate showed that petitioner worked as Oiler on board 
M.V. Alshaheen MPS

 (DPS2) from August 6, 2008 to August 10, 2009. Evidently, petitioner 
rendered his services to Al Mansoori within the same 12-month period 
covered by the POEA Contract executed by respondent with Echo Cargo as 
the foreign principal.









 
 




Evidently, the salient terms of the Contract of Employment were altered 
or changed without the approval of the DOLE through the POEA. Respondent
 cannot feign ignorance of the same, considering that such was done well
 within the stipulated period of the POEA approved contract. As a 
licensed recruitment agency, respondent had full knowledge of the 
requirement of prior review and approval by the POEA in the event of any
 alterations or changes to the Contract. Only after gaining this 
approval shall the amendments, modifications or alterations be deemed an
 integral part of the POEA Standard Employment Contract.
[59]



In here, respondent had been complacent with the fact that it was able 
to deploy petitioner abroad without ensuring his status and his 
whereabouts despite the non-accreditation of the foreign principal Echo 
Cargo. Respondent seemed to have delighted in its own inaction, 
misguidedly secured in its flawed notion that once deployed, it no 
longer has any responsibility to petitioner. This nonchalant attitude 
cannot be countenanced. Respondent's seeming indifference cannot be 
ascribed as a simple case of negligence as it possessed full knowledge 
of its responsibilities as a licensed recruitment agency.



Needless to state that respondent's omission resulted in the change of 
petitioner's foreign employer on board a different vessel, and service 
in a totally different capacity which working conditions may have led to
 his medical repatriation. Indubitably, the substitution or alteration 
of the POEAÂ­approved contract had relegated petitioner to the 
unfavorable situation which R.A. No. 8042 specifically seeks to avoid. 
Sec. 6(i) of the law provides:


SEC. 6. Definition. - For purposes of this Act, illegal 
recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, 
transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes 
referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment 
abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by non-licensee or 
non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13(f) of Presidential
 Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the 
Philippines: 
Provided
, That any such non-licensee or non-holder 
who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad to 
two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. 
It shall likewise 
include the following acts, whether committed by any person, whether a 
non-licensee, nonÂ­ holder, licensee or holder of authority:


x x x x



(i) 
To substitute or alter to the prejudice of the worker, employment
 contracts approved and verified by the Department of Labor and 
Employment from the time of actual signing thereof by the parties up to 
and including the period of the expiration of the same without the 
approval of the Department of Labor and Employment;


x x x x (emphases supplied)




Clearly, respondent's inaction or omission was against existing law and 
public policy as it perpetrated the illegal and pernicious practice of 
substituting the POEA-approved contract to the detriment of the Filipino
 worker. Having knowingly reneged on its obligation to ensure the 
welfare of petitioner while deployed abroad, and in allowing the 
substitution of a previously approved POEA contract, respondent should 
be held liable.




To reiterate, Sec. 10 of R.A. No. 8042 allows the migrant worker to 
claim moral and exemplary damages in connection with the employment 
contract or as provided by law. In 
Becmen
,
[60]

 the Court imposed moral damages by reason of misconduct on the part of 
the employer under Article 2219(10) of the Civil Code, which allows 
recovery of such damages in actions referred to in Article 21.
[61]

 The Court also ordered the payment of exemplary damages to set an 
example to foreign employers and recruitment agencies on how to treat 
and act on the plight of distressed Filipino migrant workers.




In view of the foregoing, the Court holds that respondent should be 
liable to pay the following: moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00;
 exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00, due to its wanton 
behavior and by way of example for the public good;
[62]
 and attorney's fees equal to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award.
[63]
 Finally, the total monetary awards shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from finality of this judgment until fully satisfied.
