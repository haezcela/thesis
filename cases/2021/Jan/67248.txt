ARTOO P. GARIN, PETITIONER, VS. CITY OF MUNTINLUPA, HON. INTING, JAIME FRESNEDI, IN HIS OFFICIAL AND CAPACITY AS CITY MAYOR, KATARUNGAN VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




LEONEN, J.:


A dispute between a homeowners association and a non-member 
homeowner is an intra-association dispute; thus, jurisdiction belongs to
 the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board.
[1]


This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[2]
 assailing the Orders
[3]

 of the Regional Trial Court, which suspended the proceedings of a 
Petition for Mandamus pending exhaustion of administrative remedies with
 the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board.


 Artoo P. Garin (Garin), a resident of Pasig City, wanted to build a house in Katarungan Village in Muntinlupa City.
[4]

 Per Section 10 of Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047, one of the 
prerequisites to secure a building permit is a clearance from the 
homeowners' association.
[5]


 Garin requested clearance from Katarungan Village Homeowners 
Association (Katarungan), but clarified that "he is not a member of the 
association."
[6]
 However, 
Katarungan refused to give the required clearance until he paid an 
assessment fee and signed up for membership in their association.
[7]


 Thus, Garin filed a Petition for Mandamus with application for preliminary injunction before the Regional Trial Court.
[8]

 He sought to compel the City ofMuntinlupa to accept his application for
 processing, even without the required clearance. He also prayed that 
Section 10 of Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047 be declared 
unconstitutional "insofar as it relates to the tasking of the homeowners
 association for the issuance of clearance[.]"
[9]


 On September 5, 2014, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order
[10]

 denying the injunctive relief, but temporarily suspending the 
proceedings pending Garin's exhaustion of administrative remedies with 
the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board.
[11]


 In denying the injunctive relief, the trial court found that Garin 
failed to establish a clear right or any substantial injury that would 
be caused, since he has not yet commenced the construction of his abode.
[12]


The trial court also temporarily suspended the case pursuant to Rule 
11 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9904, 
or the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations, which 
empowers the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board to decide 
intraÂ­association disputes.
[13]
 


 Garin moved for reconsideration, but was denied by the Regional Trial Court in its January 9, 2015 Order.
[14]

 The trial court emphasized that the alleged suppression of Garin's 
right was caused by Katarungan, not Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 
02-047.
[15]
 It found that 
whether Katarungan properly imposed Republic Act No. 9904 is a matter 
that should first be determined by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory 
Board, before the constitutionality of Section 10 of Muntinlupa City 
Ordinance No. 02-047 could be decided.
[16]


 Aggrieved, Garin filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari.
[17]
 On July 27, 2015, this Court required respondents to comment on the Petition.
[18]
 


Respondent Katarungan
[19]
 and respondents City of Muntinlupa and Mayor Jaime R. Fresnedi
[20]
 (Mayor Fresnedi) filed their respective Comments, as noted in this Court's October 21, 2015 Resolution.
[21]
 


Upon being required by this Court,
[22]
 Garin filed his Consolidated Reply,
[23]
 as noted in this Court's November 6, 2017 Resolution.
[24]


Petitioner argues that the constitutionality of Section 10 of 
Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047 may be addressed by this Court 
without petitioner having to first exhaust the administrative remedies 
with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board. He argues that the 
"convoluted procedure"
[25]
 
recommended by the trial court "serves only to pressure the building 
applicant to capitulate rather than pursue the question of unjust 
imposition and derogation of one's constitutional right to 
disassociate."
[26]


 Petitioner also notes that the deed of sale of his property had no 
annotation on automatic membership in the association. This, he says, 
means that there was no contract existing between him and respondent 
Katarungan.
[27]
 


Petitioner argues that respondent Katarungan had "abused [its] delegated power"
[28]
 which was the "necessary consequence of the undefined authority conferred by the Ordinance[.]"
[29]
 He argues that "the Ordinance itself prescribes no specific limit or parameter for its exercise[.]"
[30]


 Respondent Katarungan counters that if petitioner wants to avail of 
its services, he must pay the required dues, fees, and charges.
[31]
 It notes that its refusal to issue the clearance is based on the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9904,
[32]

 which empowers an association to cause compliance on, among others, 
structures to be built within the subdivision, in accordance with 
existing laws.
[33]


In addition, Section 72 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9904 provides: 


SECTION 72. 
Prohibited Acts
. -It shall be prohibited for any person:


. . . .


 b. To deprive any homeowner of the right to avail of or enjoy basic 
community services and facilities provided that the dues, charges, and 
other fees for such services have been duly paid[.]
[34]




As for petitioner's right to abode, respondent Katarungan argues that
 this right can be limited by the general welfare clause under Section 
16 of the Local Government Code.
[35]
 It also argues that Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047 is presumed a valid exercise of police power.
[36]
 


Respondent Katarungan ends by reiterating that this case involves an 
intra-association dispute, which must properly be heard by the Housing 
and Land Use Regulatory Board, and not the regular trial courts.
[37]


 For their part, respondents City of Muntinlupa and Mayor Fresnedi cite Section 5(c)
[38]

 of HLURB Resolution No. R-771, series of 2004, and the Implementing 
Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9904, in arguing that: 


Clearly, . . . it is 
NOT
 the City Government or the 
assailed Ordinance which conferred upon [respondent Katarungan] the 
authority to issue homeowners clearance and impose fees. It is a 
national law no less, R.A. 9904, which the [Housing and Land Use 
Regulatory Board] is tasked to implement, that confers this authority[.]
[39]
 (Emphasis in the original)


In addition, Section 8 of Republic Act No. 9904 requires every 
homeowner to "pay the necessary fees, charges and special assessments of
 the homeowners' association."
[40]
 


Assuming that respondent Katarungan's power to issue a clearance was 
granted through Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047, respondents say 
that it would still be valid because of Article III, Section 2 of the 
"Zoning Ordinance."
[41]


 Respondents also raise that petitioner "resorted to an improper 
remedy" because the questioned Order is an interlocutory order, from 
which no appeal can be taken.
[42]


 In reply, petitioner reiterates that Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 
02-047 is unconstitutional because it conferred on respondent Katarungan
 "the absolute, unbridled power to determine the parameters for the 
issuance of its clearance"
[43]
â"an invalid delegation of legislative authority."
[44]
 


For resolution are the following ssues:


 First, whether or not a petition for review on certiorari under Rule
 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure is the correct remedy to question 
the Regional Trial Court's Orders; 


Second, whether or not petitioner Garin has complied with all the 
requisites of judicial review to question the constitutionality of 
Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047; 


Third, whether or not the Regional Trial Court erred in ruling that 
primary jurisdiction over the case lies with the Housing and Land Use 
Regulatory Board; and


Finally, whether or not the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board has
 jurisdiction over a dispute between a non-member homeowner and the 
homeowners' association.


We deny the Petition. 


I


As a general rule, only final judgments or orders of the trial court,
 the Court of Appeals, or the Sandiganbayan may be appealed through a 
petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. On 
its face, it may appear that the trial court's Orders were interlocutory
 orders, which are generally not appealable but may be questioned 
through a petition for certiorari under Rule 65.


However, the September 5, 2014 Order denied petitioner's application 
for preliminary injunction and suspended the case pending petitioner's 
exhaustion of administrative remedies. While this appears to be 
interlocutory, it is, in reality, an order of dismissal. Its dispositive
 portion reads:




WHEREFORE, premises considered, the application for a writ of mandatory preliminary injunction is hereby DENIED.


 Likewise, the instant case is temporarily suspended pending the 
exhaustion of administrative remedies by petitioner involving the issue 
herein with the HLURB.



 SO ORDERED[.]
[45]




The temporary suspension becomes indefmite pending any further action
 by petitioner. It creates the presumption that the trial court will 
never act on the Petition for Mandamus if petitioner does not file his 
case with the proper administrative agency. Thus, while the trial 
court's Order may appear to be an interlocutory order, it effectively 
dismissed the Petition without explicitly saying so. Hence, petitioner 
availed of the proper remedy.


In any case, petitioner elevated his appeal to this Court based on 
what he perceived to be errors of law, not errors of fact, by the trial 
court. 




II


Petitioner's main argument is that the trial court erred in refusing 
to resolve the issue on the Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02047's 
constitutionality since it was for the Housing and Land Use Regulatory 
Board to resolve. He prays that the Order be set aside and that Section 
10 of the Ordinance be declared unconstitutional.


This Court's power of judicial review may only be exercised if a case
 presents the following requisites: first, an actual case or 
controversy; second, the person bringing the case must have legal 
standing; third, the constitutional question is raised at the earliest 
possible opportunity; and fourth, the resolution of the constitutional 
question must be the very 
lis mota
 of the case, that is, it must be absolutely necessary for its determination.
[46]
 


The first three requisites are present here. The denial of 
petitioner's building permit application presents an actual controversy 
and legal standing. Petitioner is the homeowner who was directly 
"injured" by the non-issuance of the clearance by respondent Katarungan.
 He also raised the constitutional question at the earliest possible 
opportunity, submitting it before the trial court after his permit 
application had been denied.


The last requisite, however, remains wanting. Petitioner's cause of 
action can be resolved without having to pass upon the constitutional 
question.


 Petitioner argues that the requirements outlined in Section 10 of 
Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 02-047 are unconstitutional since 
requiring a homeowners' association clearance violates his right to 
disassociate. Section 10 ofthe Ordinance states: 


Section 10. APPLICATION AND APPROVAL OF PROJECTS. No project
 shall be approved unless the applicable requirements per project are 
complied with:


* Duly Accomplished and Notarized Application Form


*One Set of Plan


* One copy of lot plan with Vicinity Map


* Transfer Certificate of Title


* Barangay Clearance/Barangay Resolution
* Homeowners Association Clearance


* Deed of Sale


* Certification from MDCC/PHILVOCS
[47]


Here, respondent Katarungan refused to issue petitioner the required 
clearance until he has applied for membership and paid up the 
assessments amounting to P72,000.00, which, petitioner argues, "had 
nothing to do with the zoning, classification purpose of the Ordinance."
[48]

 Because petitioner could not secure the clearance, the City of 
Muntinlupa refused to process his application for a building permit.


 Republic Act No. 9904, or the Magna Carta for Homeowners and 
Homeowners' Associations, prohibits any person from compelling a 
homeowner to join the association unless it is made a condition 
precedent in the "the title of the property; the contract for the 
purchase of a lot in the subdivision project; or an award under a CMP 
project or a similar tenurial arrangement[.]"
[49]

 Under Section 9 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations, membership 
is optional "[u]nless otherwise provided in the Contract to Sell, Deed 
of Sale, or other instruments of conveyance, or annotated in the title 
of the property[.]"


If petitioner's allegation that the deed of sale for his property has
 no provision on automatic membership is true, respondent Katarungan 
could have possibly violated Republic Act No. 9904 when it imposed 
membership as a prerequisite for issuing a clearance. Clearly, 
petitioner's cause of action is against respondent Katarungan, not the 
City of Muntinlupa. However, petitioner did not attach any document to 
support his claim that there is no provision on automatic membership. He
 merely alleged: 


When petitioner purchased his property in Katarungan 
Village, Muntinlupa City, there was no annotation showing his automatic 
membership in the [association]. Thus, no privity of contract arising 
from the title certificate exists between petitioner and respondent 
[Katarungan].
[50]


Further, petitioner did not state whether the assessments imposed were 
for membership fees alone. It is entirely possible that part of the 
P72,000.00 worth of assessments included payment for the issuance of the
 clearance along with basic services and facilities. Petitioner has the 
right to disassociate or not become a member of the association, but he 
cannot refuse to pay for basic services and facilities. Section 5 of 
Republic Act No. 9904 provides:


SECTION 5. 
Rights and Duties of Every Homeowner
. -Every homeowner has the right to enjoy the basic community services and facilities: 
Provided
, That he/she pays the necessary fees and other pertinent charges.



In any case, it was well within respondent City ofMuntinlupa's police
 power to require clearance from a homeowners' association as a 
prerequisite for granting a building permit.


 A homeowners' association is empowered by law, among others, to 
cause compliance with the provisions of the National Building Code or 
refuse the establishment of institutions which may disrupt the privacy 
and security of its homeowners. Section 1OG) and (k) of Republic Act No.
 9904 state: 


SECTION 10. Rights and Powers of the Association. - An 
association shall have the following rights and shall exercise the 
following powers: 


 
 
(j)
 
 
Cause compliance with regard to height regulations, easements,
 use of homes, buildings, edifices, or structures that may be 
built within the subdivision, in accordance with the National 
Building Code, zoning laws, HLURB rules and regulations, 
existing local ordinances, and existing deeds of restriction; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(k)


 
Subject to consultation and with 
the approval of a simple majority of the association members, 
allow the establishment of certain institutions such as, but not limited
 to, schools, hospitals, markets, grocery stores and other similar 
establishments that will necessarily affect the character of the 
subdivision/village in terms of traffic generation, and/or 
opening the area to outsiders which may result in the loss of 
privacy, security, safety, and tranquility to its residents, in 
accordance with the National Building Code, zoning laws, existing local 
ordinances, HLURB rules and regulations, and 
existing jurisprudence: Provided, That such prior approval shall not be 
necessary for the establishment of sari - sari stores, home industries 
and similar small-scale business enterprises within the 
subdivision/village classified as socialized housing[.]
 
 


The Ordinance's requirement to secure a homeowners' association 
clearance applies to all homeowners' associations in Muntinlupa City, 
and not just respondent Katarungan. While the requisites for securing a 
clearance from respondent Katarungan may seem violative of Republic Act 
No. 9904 for allegedly forcing petitioner to become a member, it does 
not follow that the requirements for the issuance of a clearance by 
all
 other homeowners' associations within Muntinlupa City violate the law.


 Petitioner's cause of action, therefore, was not the result of the 
alleged invalidity of Section 10 of Muntinlupa City Ordinance No. 
02-047, but the alleged illegality of respondent Katarungan's clearance 
requirements. His case can be resolved in the proper proceeding without 
passing upon the constitutional question. 


III


The trial court did not err in ruling that the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board has primary jurisdiction over the case. In 
JAKA Investments Corporation v. Urdaneta Village Association, Inc.
,
[51]

 this Court held that "[c]ases involving intra-association controversies
 fall under the jurisdiction ofthe Housing and Land Use Regulatory 
Board, the government agency with the technical expertise on the 
matter."
[52]
 


Section 20(d) of Republic Act No. 9904 provides: 


SECTION 20. 
Duties and Responsibilities of the HLURB
.
 -In addition to the powers, authorities and responsibilities vested in 
it by Republic Act No. 8763, Presidential Decree No. 902-A, Batas 
Pambansa Big. 68 and Executive Order No. 535, Series of 1981, as 
amended, the HLURB shall:


. . . . 


(d) Hear and decide intra-association and/or 
inter-association controversies and/or conflicts, without prejudice to 
filing civil and criminal cases by the parties concerned before the 
regular courts: Provided, That all decisions of the HLURB are appealable
 directly to the Court of Appeals[.]


Section 4(w) of the law's Implementing Rules and Regulations defines an "intra-association dispute":


(w)
 Intra-association dispute
 refers to a 
controversy which arises out of the relations between and among members 
of the association; between any or all of them and the association of 
which they are members; and between such association and the State 
insofar as it concerns their individual franchise or right to exist. 
It
 refers also to a controversy which is intrinsically connected with the 
regulation of associations or dealing with the internal affairs of such 
entity
. (Emphasis supplied)


The next question that may be asked is whether the Housing and Land 
Use Regulatory Board has jurisdiction even if petitioner is not a member
 of the homeowners' association.

We answer in the affirmative.


Republic Act No. 9904 differentiates between a homeowner and a member. Section 30) defmes a homeowner: 


(j) "Homeowner" refers to any of the following:


(1) An owner or purchaser of a lot in a subdivision/village;


(2) An awardee, usufructuary, or legal occupant of a unit, house 
and/or lot in a government socialized or economic housing or relocation 
project and other urban estates; or


(3) An informal settler in the process of being accredited as 
beneficiary or awardee of ownership rights under the CMP, LTAP, and 
other similar programs. 


"Member" is not specifically defined, but Section 6 of the law states
 that "[a] homeowner as defined under this Act shall be qualified to be a
 member of an association[.]"


 The issue in this case may be considered a matter involving the 
internal affairs of the association. For internal affairs of the 
association, the Implementing Rules and Regulations does not mention 
that at least one of the parties to the dispute must be a member of the 
association.


 Moreover, in 2017, the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board 
promulgated HLURB Resolution No. 963-17, or the Revised Rules of 
Proceedings Before Regional Arbiters:
[53]


Rule 2


Regional Arbiters


. . . . 


6.2. 
Jurisdiction over homeowners and homeowners association
s. The Arbiters shall exercise exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving homeowners associations, as follows:


. . . . 


 6.2.4. Disputes or controversies between the association and the 
homeowners or other beneficial users relating to the exercise of their 
respective rights, duties and obligations[.]
[54]




Based on its current rules of procedure, the Housing and Land Use 
Regulatory Board has jurisdiction over disputes between a non-member 
homeowner and the homeowners' association. 


WHEREFORE
, the Regional Trial Court's September 5, 2014 and January 9, 2015 Orders in Civil Case No. 3930 are
