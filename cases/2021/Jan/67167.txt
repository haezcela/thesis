CARANDANG, J.:


Before Us is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]

 filed by petitioner Spouses Danilo and Nelda Yabut (spouses Yabut), 
represented by their son, Manuel C. Yabut (Manuel) assailing the 
Decision
[2]
 dated July 20, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 109165 affirming the Decision
[3]
dated
 June 27, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 55 in
 Civil Case No. 08-119524, which dismissed the complaint
[4]
 for annulment of the Special Power of Attorney
[5]
 (SPA) and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
[6]
(REM) executed by Anita Ignacio
[7]
 (Anita) in favor of Michelle C. Nachbaur (respondent).


Facts of the Case


Spouses Yabut, represented by their son Manuel alleged that Jose So and 
Antonio So (brothers So) were the owners of a parcel of land and 
improvements thereon located at 1150 Lardizabal St., Sampaloc, Manila 
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 196082
[8]

 (subject property), registered in the name of Antonio So (Antonio), 
married to Anita and Jose So. Manuel claimed that since 2001, he has 
been in possession of the property by virtue of a contract of lease.
[9]
 On July 2, 2007, brothers So sold the subject property to spouses Yabut for P3,300,000.00.
On July 2, 2007, brothers So sold the subject property to spouses Yabut for P3,300,000.00.
[10]
 The original title of the subject property was given to Manuel by Antonio after the payment of the purchase price.
[11]

 Thereafter, the brothers So paid the corresponding taxes and obtained 
the Certificate Authorizing Registration and Tax Clearance Certificate 
from the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
[12]


To cause the transfer of the title of the property in his parents' name,
 Manuel engaged the services of a certain Fe Manubay (Fe). Manuel also 
gave the original title, the Certificate Authorizing Registration and 
Tax Clearance Certificate to Fe in order to facilitate the transfer. For
 this, Manuel paid Fe an amount of P20,000.00. Then, sometime November 
2007, Fe delivered to Manuel TCT No. 271840, the purported new title to 
the subject property. The said title however was registered in the name 
of Manuel.
[13]



Sometime January 2008, a group of people arrived at the subject property
 and sought permission from Manuel to conduct an ocular inspection. It 
was then that Manuel learned that the subject property also became the 
subject of a mortgage agreement. The group of people who conducted the 
ocular inspection were armed with an original Owner's Duplicate 
Certificate of TCT No. 196082, which was annotated with an SPA and a 
REM. Manuel inquired with the brothers So as to whether they executed an
 SPA and a REM but the latter denied having executed those documents. 
Alarmed, Manuel went to the Register of Deeds of Manila (RD) to verify 
the title given to him by Fe and he learned that TCT No. 271840 under 
his name was fake.
[14]


Manuel asked Fe about the fake title. Fe then told Manuel that she will 
return the original title and the amount of P10,000.00 to Manuel. The 
promissory note
[15]
 executed 
by Fe in favor of Manuel to the effect that she will return the amount 
of P10,000.00 and return TCT No. 196082 was presented during the trial 
by respondent.
[16]



Fe, however, failed to return the P10,000.00 and the title. Sometime in 2009, Manuel filed a case for 
estafa

 and falsification against Fe. To protect petitioners' claim to the 
property, Manuel caused the annotation of an Adverse Claim over the 
property.
[17]


Meanwhile, on November 15, 2007, an SPA was allegedly executed by the 
brothers So in favor of Anita authorizing her to mortgage the property. 
Thus, on the strength of the SPA, Anita mortgaged the subject property 
and executed a REM
[18]
 and a Promissory Note
[19]

 on December 6, 2007, to secure the loan obtained by the brothers So 
from a certain Michelle Nachbaur in the amount of P800,000.00.
[20]


According to respondent, she came to know Anita through her 
sister-in-law, Sarah O. Vitaliano (Sarah). Anita's broker, Cora Ladiana 
(Cora) contacted Manuela Otrera (Manuela), Sarah's mother, to ask if 
Manuela knew someone who was willing to lend money to be secured by a 
real estate mortgage. Sarah then referred Anita to the respondent. The 
latter at first was not interested, but she eventually agreed 
considering that the loan will only be for a short period and because 
Anita badly needed money for the hospitalization of her husband.
[21]


Respondent asked Sarah to verify the title of the property if the same 
is clean and to verify if Anita has the authority to mortgage the 
property. Likewise, respondent asked Sarah to make an actual inspection 
of the subject property. After verifying that Anita had the authority to
 mortgage the property and after inspecting the title and the property 
were clean, Manuela, Cora, Anita and Norayda Palugod (Norayda) went to 
respondent's house on December 6, 2007. Anita signed the real estate 
mortgage and promissory note. To confirm the identification of Anita, 
the latter presented her company ID and Postal ID. Thereafter, Anita and
 the others went to the RD to have the REM and the SPA were annotated, 
Anita went back to respondent's house and surrendered the original title
 with its annotations and the tax declaration. In turn, respondent gave 
P760,000.00 to Anita after deducting the 5% interest. Anita also issued 
seven postdated checks to respondent. All of the checks however bounced.
[22]



Manuel then filed a case against respondent for the annulment of the 
SPA, the REM and to surrender the original owner's duplicate copy of TCT
 No. 196082.
[23]
 To support 
his claim that the brothers So did not execute any SPA in favor of 
Anita, Manuel presented the affidavits of the brothers So and Anita to 
that effect.
[24]
 During the 
trial, the brothers So and Anita categorically denied that the 
signatures appearing on the SPA, REM and promissory note were their 
signatures. They testified that the genuine signatures were those on the
 Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of spouses Yabut and their affidavits.
[25]


Ruling of the Regional Trial Court


In a Decision
[26]
 dated June 
27, 2016, the RTC ruled in favor of respondent. The RTC ruled that the 
claim of forgery was not established by clear and convincing evidence. 
Further, the RTC found that respondent is a mortgagee in good faith 
since she has no notice of any lien or encumbrance on the title. The 
torrens title being incontrovertible and indefeasible, respondent was 
only charged with notice only of such burdens and claims as are 
appearing on the title. In the absence of any circumstance that would 
arouse suspicion, respondent can rely on the certificate of title. Since
 the deed of absolute sale in favor of spouses Yabut was not annotated 
in the title, the same does not bind or affect respondent.
[27]
 Thus:


WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the instant complaint is hereby DISMISSED.


The counterclaim of defendant Michelle C. Nachbaur on the payment of attorney's fees is GRANTED.


Plaintiffs are ordered to pay the defendant fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) as and for attorney's fees.


SO ORDERED.
[28]
 (Emphasis omitted)


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


In a Decision
[29]
 dated July 
20, 2018, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC. It ruled that since the
 sale was not registered, the sale cannot affect third persons. The act 
of registration is the operative act that convey or affect the land 
insofar as third persons are concerned, as such, the sale between the 
brothers So and petitioners has no effect on respondent. Further, 
respondent does not need to look beyond the title to look for possible 
hidden defects or encumbrances on the property. As such, respondent is a
 mortgagee in good faith.
[30]


Petitioners' Arguments


Spouses Yabut claimed that the RTC erred in ruling that they did not 
establish by clear and convincing evidence that the signatures appearing
 on the REM and the SPA were forged. The brothers So and Anita 
categorically testified that the signatures appearing on the Deed of 
Absolute Sale were their genuine signatures. Also, the Joint Affidavit 
of the brothers So and the Affidavit of Anita were also presented to 
show the glaring disparity of the genuine signatures appearing on those 
documents as compared to the REM, SPA and the promissory note. 
Therefore, the fact that the REM and the SPA were spurious were 
sufficiently proved by spouses Yabut. Be it noted that the brothers So 
and Anita categorically testified during trial that the signatures on 
the REM and the SPA were not their signatures. Since the REM and the SPA
 were spurious, respondent has not acquired any legal right and cannot 
be presumed to be a mortgagee in good faith.
[31]


Further, spouses Yabut alleged that the RTC erred in ruling that 
respondent was a mortgagee in good faith. Respondent failed to prove 
that she exercised due diligence in entering into the REM. She should 
have exercised a greater diligence in verifying the property and the 
authority of Anita, since she was transacting with an agent.
[32]


Respondent's Arguments


Respondent argued that the RTC correctly held that the claim of forged 
signatures was not properly proven by a clear and convincing evidence. 
The mere denial of the brothers So and Anita in the absence of a 
comparative presentation of their genuine signatures does not constitute
 evidence of forgery. Also, the ruling that respondent was a mortgagee 
in good faith is correct. A mortgagee has the right to rely on the 
certificate of title and in the absence of any suspicion, has no 
obligation to undertake further investigation.
[33]


Issue


Whether respondent is a mortgagee in good faith such that the real estate mortgage is superior than the unregistered sale.


Ruling of the Court


At the outset, the issues raised by spouses Yabut in the present 
petition are questions of fact which normally are beyond this Court's 
jurisdiction. Questions of fact which require a re-evaluation of the 
evidence cannot be entertained in a petition under Rule 45. However, 
such rule is not absolute. When the judgment is based on a 
misapprehension of facts and when the findings of facts of the appellate
 court are contradicted by the evidence, such as in this case, this 
Court can examine the records and facts of the case.
[34]



Perusal of the records of the case show that the Deed of Absolute Sale 
and the Affidavits of Antonio, Jose and Anita, coupled by their 
categorical testimony that their signatures were forged, as compared to 
the SPA, REM, and promissory note, makes a re-examination of the 
evidence necessary.


The forged signatures of the brothers

So and Anita were sufficiently proved.


Forgery cannot be presumed. It must be proved by clear, positive and 
convincing evidence. The burden of proof lies on the party alleging 
forgery.
[35]
The fact of 
forgery can only be established by a comparison between the alleged 
forged signature and the authentic and genuine signature of the person 
whose signature is theorized upon to have been forged.
[36]


The RTC and the CA erred in ruling that there are no comparative 
signatures showing the genuine signatures of the brothers So and Anita 
where the Court can examine the genuine and the forged signatures. In 
this case, to prove that the signatures of the brothers So and Anita 
appearing on the SPA,
[37]
 REM
[38]
 and promissory note
[39]
 are all forgeries, spouses Yabut presented the Deed of Absolute Sale
[40]
, the Joint Affidavit
[41]
 of the brothers So and the Affidavit
[42]

 of Anita So. The brothers So and Anita were categorical in testifying 
during the trial that the signatures appearing on the Deed of Absolute 
Sale and the Affidavits are their genuine signatures while those on the 
SPA, REM and promissory note are not their signatures.

Settled is the fact that the presentation of handwriting experts to 
prove forgery is not required. 
The judge exercises independent judgment 
on the issue of authenticity of signatures.
[43]

 When the dissimilarity between the genuine and false specimens of 
writing is visible to the naked eye and would not ordinarily escape 
notice or detection from an unpracticed observer, resort to technical 
rules is no longer necessary and the instrument may be stricken off for 
being spurious. In other words, when so established and is conspicuously
 evident from its appearance, the opinion of handwriting experts on the 
forged document is no longer necessary.
[44]



Our review of the documents would readily show that there is apparent 
dissimilarity between the signatures on the Deed of Absolute Sale, the 
Joint Affidavit of the brothers So and the Affidavit of Anita, and the 
SPA, REM, and promissory note. In fact, the signatures are entirely 
different with each other such that the conclusion that the signatures 
on the questioned documents were made by another person can be 
reasonably presumed. Therefore, the SPA, REM, and promissory note can be
 declared as spurious. Be it noted that the documents were all executed 
merely months apart,
[45]
 thus, a comparison between the documents can result to an accurate analysis and conclusion.


Respondent is not a mortgagee in

good faith.



Nevertheless, a forged deed does not necessarily mean that it cannot 
confer any right. A fraudulent or forged deed may give rise to a valid 
title in the hands of an innocent third person. The determination of 
whether respondent's real estate mortgage is superior than the deed of 
sale lies not on whether the deed of sale was registered or not, but 
rather on the determination whether respondent is a mortgagee in good 
faith or in bad faith.


The "mortgagee in good faith" rule is based on the principle that 
persons dealing with a property covered by a torrens certificate of 
title are not required to go beyond what appears on the title,
[46]
 in the absence of any sign that might arouse suspicion.
[47]

 This doctrine, however, does not apply when the mortgagee does not 
directly deal with the registered owner, such as in this case. It is 
incumbent upon the mortgagee to exercise greater care and higher degree 
of prudence in dealing with the mortgagor.
[48]

 One who transacts with another who is not the registered owner of the 
property is expected to examine not only the certificate of title but 
all factual circumstances necessary for to determine if there are any 
flaws in the title of the transferor, or in the capacity to transfer the
 land.
[49]


Here, respondent is not a mortgagee in good faith since she failed to 
investigate the true nature of the property despite knowledge of 
circumstances that cause suspicion.


First
, respondent was merely dealing with an attorney-in-fact. 
Despite the presence of an alleged SPA from the registered owners, 
respondent should have inquired with the registered owners as to the 
extent of the authority of the attorney-in-fact, especially when the 
property is co-owned by two persons.


Second
, respondent did not personally investigate the identity of
 the property. Respondent claims that she asked her sister-in-law to 
conduct inspection of the property. If indeed they conducted a thorough 
inspection of the property, it is impossible not to notice the 
occupation of Manuel in the property. The fact that Manuel is the actual
 possessor and occupant of the property is undisputed. Despite the 
presence of Manuel in the property, respondent failed to inquire as to 
the nature of Manuel's possession of the property. Respondent cannot 
simply turn a blind eye and claim ignorance of any defect in the title 
of the property when a simple investigation would have revealed that the
 property was previously sold to spouses Yabut by the registered owners.


Third
, respondent was the one who presented the promissory note 
executed by Fe to Manuel stating that Fe will return the original title 
to Manuel. Rather than help respondent's claim, this even corroborates 
Manuel's testimony that the original owner's duplicate copy of the title
 was given to Fe for the purpose of registering the Deed of Sale. Be it 
noted that as testified by brothers So, the original owner's duplicate 
copy was already given to Manuel after the payment of the purchase 
price. Thereafter, for the purpose of transferring the title in the name
 of spouses Yabut, Manuel gave the title to Fe. These circumstances 
readily show that it is impossible for Anita to transact with respondent
 and hand over the title to the latter, when the title was already in 
the possession of Fe. Thus, in all probability the forgery was caused by
 Fe.
While We commiserate with the situation respondent is in, We are 
constrained to rule that the spurious REM, SPA and promissory note 
cannot grant respondent any right superior than the Deed of Absolute 
Sale in favor of the Yabut spouses. The issue in this case is not 
whether the Deed of Sale was registered in order to affect the land, but
 whether respondent was a mortgagee in good faith. As borne by the 
records, respondent failed to exercise the due diligence in dealing with
 an attorney-in-fact whose authority was derived from a spurious SPA. 
Further, respondent failed to fully investigate the title and condition 
of the land. 
As to the cancellation of TCT No. 196082 in the name of brothers So and 
the issuance of a new title in the name of spouses Yabut, this Court 
cannot immediately order its issuance as there are other processes 
exclusive to the domain of the RD that spouses Yabut must comply and 
file.
