FIRST DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 209601, January 12, 2021 ]


UNITED COCONUT PLANTERS BANK, PETITIONER, VS. SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR, TIRSO ANTIPORDA, JR. AND GLORIA CARREON, RESPONDENTS.


DECISION




CAGUIOA, J:


At the outset, the Court notes that the purported "point of law still undecided in our jurisprudence â 
i.e.
,
 whether Section 144 of the Corporation Code, which provides penal 
sanctions for violations of 'any provision of this Code or its 
amendments not otherwise specifically penalized therein,' is applicable 
to violations under Section 31 of the same Code, which provides for a 
civil indemnity,"
[1]
 as posited by petitioner, has, in fact, already been resolved by the Court in 
Ient v. Tullett Prebon (Philippines), Inc.
[2]
 
(Ient)
. In this connection, the Court also notes at the outset that 
Batas Pambansa Blg
. 68, otherwise known as "The Corporation Code of the Philippines," has been repealed by Republic Act No. 11232
[3]
otherwise known as the "Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines."

Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[4]
 (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) assailing the Decision
[5]
 dated May 24, 2013 and the Resolution
[6]
 dated October 17, 2013 of the Court of Appeals
[7]
 (CA) in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 114184.
[8]
 The CA Decision dismissed the Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari

 filed by UCPB and affirmed the Resolutions dated July 30, 2008 and 
March 1, 2010 of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary while the CA 
Resolution denied the motion for partial reconsideration filed by UCPB.


The Facts and Antecedent Proceedings


The CA Decision narrates the factual antecedents as follows:


x x x [UCPB], through its Legal Services Division Head, x x x
 Jose A. Barcelon, filed the Complaint-Affidavit dated 23 July 2007, for
 violation of Section 31 in relation to Section 144 of the Corporation 
Code against private respondents [Tirso Antiporda Jr. (Antiporda) and 
Gloria Carreon (Carreon)], docketed as I.S. No. 2007-633, before the 
[DOJ].

The Complaint-Affidavit alleged: [Antiporda and Carreon] were [UCPB's] 
former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), and former 
President and Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), respectively; UCPB 
Capital, Inc. ("UCAP"), a wholly owned subsidiary of [UCPB], was engaged
 in trading, underwriting of securities and syndication of loans from 
1996 to 1998; sometime in 1998, [Antiporda and Carreon] authorized the 
payment of bonuses, to some of [UCPB's] corporate officers and 
directors, for this purpose, 50 manager's checks amounting to Php 
117,872,269.43 were released from 6 April to 31 July 1998; on 27 
February 1998, due to substantial losses, [UCPB's] Board of Directors 
resolved to shorten the corporate existence of UCAP effective 31 March 
1998 and approved the takeover, purchase of assets and assumption of 
liabilities of UCAP by [UCPB]; when UCAP was absorbed by [UCPB], it had 
liabilities in the amount of Php 4.4 Billion; notwithstanding, 
[Antiporda's and Carreon's] knowledge of UCAP's losses, they declared 
bonuses in 1998 in bad faith, with gross negligence and in violation of 
[UCPB's] by-laws which requires a board authority prior to declaration 
of bonuses; thus, [Antiporda and Carreon] are liable under Section 31 of
 the Corporation Code which provides for the liability of directors or 
officers who conduct the affairs of a corporation in bad faith; and, 
[Antiporda and Carreon] are criminally liable under Section 144 which 
provides for penalties for violations of the Corporation Code.

[Antiporda] filed [a] Counter-Affidavit and alleged: his actions as 
Chairman and CEO were not done in bad faith as he was merely guided by 
[UCPB's] audited Financial Statements, by-laws and policies; [UCPB's] 
by-laws provided that 10% of [UCPB's] net profit is allot[t]ed as 
bonuses to its directors and officers, and, what is subject to Board 
approval is only the manner by which [UCPB's] President distributes the 
4% of the net profit to other officers; it had been the practice of 
[UCPB] to pay bonuses without a board resolution; the [Bangko Sentral ng
 Pilipinas (BSP)] examiners never questioned the absence of a board 
resolution in [UCPB's] previous grant of bonuses; there was factual and 
legal basis in the payment of bonus since [UCPB's] financial statements 
in 1997 showed a consolidated net income of Php 2.115 billion; there was
 no evidence of [UCPB's] losses amounting to Php 4.4 billion; the Php 
4.4 billion losses referred by [UCPB] was due to depreciation in the 
market values of the foreclosed real properties in 1998, thus, it is 
appropriate to charge these losses to years 1999 to 2003; while UCAP 
suffered a loss in 1997, other subsidiaries and affiliates of [UCPB] 
earned profits in excess of the Php 149 million loss incurred by UCAP, 
which formed the basis to declare bonuses in 1998; UCAP's loss of Php 
149 million in 1997 is a mere fraction of the Php 2.115 billion earned 
by [UCPB], as the parent bank; and, the action had prescribed since the 
alleged violation was committed in April 1998 and more than 9 years 
passed when the complaint was filed in 2007.

Carreon filed [a] Counter-Affidavit and alleged: there was sufficient 
legal and factual justification for the grant of bonuses since (a) it 
was expressly authorized by [UCPB's] by-laws, (b) it was the 
long-established policy and practice of [UCPB], and (c) the financial 
condition of [UCPB] allowed the grant of the bonuses; the bonuses given 
in a fiscal year are based on the net profit of [UCPB] in the 
immediately preceding fiscal year, since [UCPB] had a net profit of Php 
2.115 billion in 1997, there was a basis of bonus in 1998; the 
allegation of substantial losses was contradicted by the audited 
financial statements of [UCPB] for 1997 and 1998; the financial 
statements showing [UCPB's] losses were only released subsequent to her 
tenure with [UCPB]; there is no evidence that UCAP incurred losses of 
Php 4.4 billion in 1997; assuming that there were losses, she could not 
have known, because both the internal auditors and the independent 
auditors did not attest to the losses; she was not involved in the 
approval or distribution of bonuses since her participation was limited 
in evaluating the officers' performance; for the period covering her 
stay from 1993 to 1998, [UCPB's] internal and external auditors, and the
 examiners of BSP never questioned the grant and distribution of the 
bonuses, notwithstanding, the lack of a board resolution authorizing its
 grant; the presumption of regular performance of duties (Section 3[p] 
and 3[q], Rule 131 of the Revised Rules of Evidence) should operate in 
her favor; and, the action had prescribed.

[UCPB] filed [a] Consolidated Reply-Affidavit and alleged: the release 
of the bonuses was surreptitious since there was no board approval as 
certified by the Certification dated 9 January 2007; [Antiporda and 
Carreon] were aware of [UCPB's] losses since they participated in the 
board meeting where UCAP's financial problems were discussed, 
particularly, the Php 4 billion worth of UCAP's liabilities; [Antiporda]
 admitted in his counter-affidavit that he had knowledge of [UCPB's] 
losses; as high-ranking officers of [UCPB, Antiporda and Can-eon] cannot
 just rely on the findings of a subordinate controller; x x x Carreon's 
argument that her participation was limited, was negated by the demands 
and the seniority of her position and the bonuses will not be released 
without [Antiporda's and Carreon's] authorization; while the 10% bonus 
is specifically authorized by [UCPB's] by-laws, the manner and the 
procedure of the grant of the bonus[es] require the approval of the 
board of directors; the action had not prescribed since the reckoning 
period is not the commission of the violation but from discovery and 
institution of judicial proceedings, since, the issuance of bonuses was 
concealed from [UCPB]; and, prescription should only run upon the 
discovery of the unauthorized payment of bonuses through the special 
audit report of KPMG [o]n 30 June 2003.

[Antiporda] filed [a] Rejoinder Affidavit and alleged: [UCPB] did not 
refute that the grant and release of the bonuses without a board 
resolution was a long-standing practice; [UCPB] did not deny that it is 
the profits of [UCPB], as the parent bank, which were considered in 
granting the bonuses; thus, the Php 2.115 billion profits of [UCPB] were
 sufficient basis for the bonus; [UCPB's] financial statements showed 
that its losses through its assumption of liabilities from UCAP only 
amounted to Php 140.860 million not Php 4.4 billion, since the Php 4.430
 billion loss did not appear in [UCPB's] audited financial statements in
 1997 and 1998, it is logical to assume that the losses did not exist at
 such time; the cumulative losses acquired through several years could 
not affect the granting of the bonus in 1998 since the bonus in question
 was solely dependent on the net profits in 1997; prescription must be 
based on the commission of the alleged offense not on the discovery, 
since the grant of the bonus was publicly-known; the checks for the 
bonuses were signed by the controller and were cleared by the auditor 
and distributed to [UCPB's] directors and officers, thus, as early as 
1998, [UCPB] had full knowledge of the facts of the alleged offense; 
and, the alleged discovery of the offense on 30 June 2003, through the 
KPMG report, was unsubstantiated.

Carreon filed [a] Rejoinder Affidavit and alleged that the offense had 
prescribed since the grant of the bonus could have been discovered since
 all the pertinent records would have been available to [UCPB] in 
October 1998.

[UCPB] and [Antiporda] filed their respective Memoranda.

On 8 April 2008, the DOJ Task Force On Bank Fraud Cases issued the 
Resolution, finding probable cause against [Antiporda and Carreon] for 
violation of Section 31 in relation to Section 144 of the Corporation 
Code. It held: the action was not barred by prescription since [UCPB's] 
management discovered the unauthorized payment of bonuses only through 
the special audit report of KPMG on 30 June 2003; a board resolution is 
required before the grant of bonus as indicated in [UCPB's] by-laws; 
and, arguments raised by [Antiporda and Carreon] are matters of defense 
which they will have to present during trial.

The corresponding Information was filed, docketed as Criminal Case No. 
08-1106 before the Regional Trial Court ("RTC"), Makati.

[Antiporda] filed the Petition for Review before the DOJ Secretary 
seeking to set aside the Resolution dated 8 April 2008, and praying the 
Information in Criminal Case No. 08-1106, be withdrawn. It alleged: 
[UCPB] did not submit the KPMG special audit report as evidence; the 
Investigating Prosecutor erred in disregarding the long standing 
practice of the bank in granting bonuses based on [UCPB's] profits and 
without a board resolution; the practice of granting bonuses without a 
board resolution was never questioned through the years, and was 
ratified by [UCPB's] Board of directors; the BSP examiners did not cite 
the absence of a board resolution authorizing the annual payment of 
bonuses as an audit exception; he acted in good faith in relying on 
[UCPB's] practice that no board resolution is necessary; there was no 
finding that his acts indicated bad faith or gross negligence, which is 
not presumed; there was no finding as to the presence of any of the 
elements penalized under Section 31 of the Corporation Code; it was 
unfair that [Antiporda and Carreon] were the only officers charged by 
[UCPB]; and [UCPB's] business is a heavily regulated industry and whose 
operations were documented, thus, the discovery rule should not be 
applied.

In the assailed 30 July 2008 Resolution, the DOJ Secretary ruled Section
 144 was not applicable to violations of Section 31 of the Corporation 
Code, and the action against [Antiporda and Carreon] had prescribed. It 
held: the penalties in Section 144 of the Corporation Code apply, only 
when the other provisions of the Corporation Code, do not provide 
penalties; since Section 31 provides for the remedy of civil action for 
damages, Section 144 does not apply anymore; the act of "gross 
negligence and bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation" 
can be committed only by the directors and trustees of the corporation, 
thus, consistent with the principle of strict construction of penal 
laws, [Antiporda and Carreon] as [UCPB's] officers, are not liable; the 
action has prescribed since the alleged violation, which was committed 
by the payment of the bonus in early 1998, occurred more than 9 years 
ago; the allegation that the grant of the bonuses was only discovered 
through the KPMG audit report was unsubstantiated; the granting of the 
bonuses was made in public, thus, as early as 1998, [UCPB] had full 
knowledge of the offense and there was no need for the KPMG audit 
report; and, the findings of the DOJ Secretary were equally applicable 
to Carreon although she failed to appeal.

The 30 July 2008 DOJ Secretary Resolution set aside the DOJ Task Force 
On Bank Fraud Cases Resolution of 8 April 2008, and directed the Office 
of the Chief State Prosecutor to withdraw the Information in Criminal 
Case No. 08-1106.

[UCPB] filed the Motion for Reconsideration. [Antiporda and Carreon] 
separately filed their Oppositions to [UCPB's] Motion for 
Reconsideration. [UCPB] filed [a] Consolidated-Reply (To 
Respondents-Appellants' Oppositions). However, the DOJ Secretary denied 
the Motion for Reconsideration in the assailed Resolution of 1 March 
2010.

Thus, [UCPB filed a Rule 65] Petition for 
Certiorari
 [before the CA].
[9]


Ruling of the CA


The CA, in its Decision
[10]
 of May 24, 2013, dismissed the Rule 65 
certiorari

 petition of UCPB. With the CA holding that Section 31 of the 
Corporation Code was clear and categorical, there was therefore no room 
for construction or interpretation, but only for application.
[11]

 The CA observed that there would be no basis to subject directors, 
trustees, or corporate officers liable under Section 31 to the penalties
 under Section 144 of the Corporation Case because Section 31 itself 
provides for the proper remedy, which is civil sanction for damages 
rather than criminal sanction under Section 144.
[12]

 According to the CA, by providing the remedy of damages, the 
legislative intent is clear that Section 31 violations are excluded from
 the application of Section 144; and to apply Section 144 to acts 
committed under Section 31 would unduly extend its application to 
situations not intended by the legislature and would also violate the 
principle of strict construction of penal laws.
[13]


The CA also ruled that Antiporda and Carreon, as members of UCPB's Board
 of Directors, could be held liable for violating Section 31 of the 
Corporation Code because Antiporda was sued in his capacity as UCPB's 
Chairman of the Board while Carreon was sued in her capacity as 
Director, which were their designations at the time of the alleged 
Section 31 violation.
[14]


Further, the CA ruled that the action for violation of Section 31 of the Corporation Code had prescribed.
[15]
 The CA disagreed with the DOJ Secretary in applying the provisions of Act No. 3326,
[16]
 specifically Section 1
[17]
 on the issue of prescription.
[18]
 The CA applied Article 1146
[19]

 of the Civil Code because Section 31 only provides for payment of 
damages as penalty to erring directors and not fine and/or imprisonment.
[20]

 Counting four years from the commission of the offense in 1998, and not
 from the KPMG special audit report in 2003, which does not pertain to 
the financial losses suffered by UCPB at the time of the approval of the
 bonuses in 1998 and does not support UCPB's allegation that it was only
 in 2003 when it could have discovered the offense committed by 
Antiporda and Carreon, the action had prescribed in 2002.
[21]
 Thus, when the Complaint-Affidavit of UCPB was filed on July 23, 2007, the action had already prescribed.
[22]

 Also, the discovery rule was inapplicable given that the approval and 
grant of the questioned bonuses were widely and publicly known and that 
UCPB belongs to the heavily-regulated banking industry whose 
transactions are documented and audited by the BSP on a regular basis.
[23]


Finally, the CA ruled that the DOJ Secretary did not commit grave abuse 
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when he 
dismissed UCPB's complaint and ordered the withdrawal of the 
Information.
[24]


The dispositive portion of the CA Decision states:


WHEREFORE
, the Petition For 
Certiorari
 is 
DISMISSED
. The Resolution dated 30 July 2008, and the Resolution dated 1 March 2010, are 
AFFIRMED
.


SO ORDERED.
[25]


Not satisfied, UCPB filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration,
[26]
which the CA denied in its Resolution
[27]
 dated October 17, 2013.

Hence, the present UCPB's Rule 45 
certiorari
 Petition dated December 13, 2013. Antiporda filed his Comment
[28]
 dated March 18, 2014. Carreon filed her Comment
[29]
 dated March 19, 2014. UCPB filed its Consolidated Reply
[30]
 dated June 5, 2014. Antiporda filed his Memorandum
[31]
 dated April 13, 2015, while Carreon filed her Memorandum
[32]
 dated April 23, 2015. UCPB filed its Memorandum
[33]
 dated May 11, 2015.


The Issues


The Petition raises two issues:


 
 
(1) 
 
whether the CA erred in ruling that Section 144 of the Corporation Code does not apply to Section 31 thereof; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
whether the CA erred in ruling that the action based on Section 31 of the Corporation Code had prescribed.
 
 


The Ruling of the Court


The present case calls for the application of Sections 31 and 144 of the
 Corporation Code. As noted at the outset, the Corporation Code has been
 repealed by the Revised Corporation Code (RCC), which became effective 
on February 23, 2019. Despite the passage of the later law, the former 
is to be applied in this case because the alleged violation committed by
 Antiporda and Carreon happened in 1998 while the Corporation Code was 
in effect.

Section 31 of the Corporation Code provides:


SECTION 31. 
Liability of Directors, Trustees or Officers
.
 â Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent 
to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross 
negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation or 
acquire any personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with their duty 
as such directors or trustees shall be liable jointly and severally for 
all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its 
stockholders or members and other persons.

When a director, trustee or officer attempts to acquire or acquires, in 
violation of his duty, any interest adverse to the corporation in 
respect of any matter which has been reposed in him in confidence, as to
 which equity imposes a disability upon him to deal on his own behalf, 
he shall be liable as a trustee for the corporation and must account for
 the profits which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation.


The counterpart provision in the RCC is Section 30, which states:


SEC. 30. 
Liability of Directors, Trustees or Officers
.
 â Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent 
to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross 
negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation or 
acquire any personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with their duty 
as such directors or trustees shall be liable jointly and severally for 
all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its 
stockholders or members and other persons.


A
 director, trustee or officer 
shall not attempt
 to acquire or acquire [ ] any interest adverse to the corporation in respect of any matter which has been reposed in 
them
 in confidence, 
and upon which,
 equity imposes a disability upon 
themselves
 to deal 
in their
 own behalf; 
otherwise the said director, trustee or officer

 shall be liable as a trustee for the corporation and must account for 
the profits which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation.
[34]


Section 144 of the Corporation Code, in turn, provides:


SECTION 144. 
Violations of the Code
. â Violations of 
any of the provisions of this Code or its amendments not otherwise 
specifically penalized therein shall be punished by a fine of not less 
than one thousand (P1,000.00) pesos but not more than ten thousand 
(P10,000.00) pesos or by imprisonment for not less than thirty (30) days
 but not more than five (5) years, or both, in the discretion of the 
court. If the violation is committed by a corporation, the same may, 
after notice and hearing, be dissolved in appropriate proceedings before
 the Securities and Exchange Commission: 
Provided
, That such 
dissolution shall not preclude the institution of appropriate action 
against the director, trustee or officer of the corporation responsible 
for said violation: 
Provided, further,
 That nothing in this 
section shall be construed to repeal the other causes for dissolution of
 a corporation provided in this Code.


The counterpart provision in the RCC is Section 170, which states:


SEC. 170. 
Other
 Violations of the Code; 
Separate Liability
. - Violations of any of the 
other

 provisions of this Code or its amendments not otherwise specifically 
penalized therein shall be punished by a fine of not less than 
Ten
 thousand 
pesos
 (P
10
,000.00) but not more than 
One million pesos (PI,000,000.00)

 [ ]. If the violation is committed by a corporation, the same may, 
after notice and hearing, be dissolved in appropriate proceedings before
 the [ ] Commission: 
Provided
, That such dissolution shall not 
preclude the institution of appropriate action against the director, 
trustee, or officer of the corporation responsible for said violation: 
Provided, further
,
 That nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal the other 
causes for dissolution of a corporation provided in this Code.


Liability for any of the foregoing offenses shall be separate from 
any other administrative, civil, or criminal liability under this Code 
and other laws.
[35]


Proceeding to the first issue, UCPB argues that the civil sanction for 
damages under Section 31 of the Corporation Code is not the same as the 
imposition of penalty because damages refer to the sum of money that the
 law awards or imposes as pecuniary compensation, recompense or 
satisfaction for an injury done or a wrong sustained as a consequence of
 a breach of a contractual obligation, a tortious act or an illegal act 
while a penalty is the suffering inflicted by the State for the 
transgression of a law.
[36]
Citing 
Ramos v. Gonong
,
[37]

 UCPB posits that civil liability is not part of the penalty of the 
crime committed and when it is imposed for the commission of crimes, it 
is neither part of, nor intended to be merged into, the punishment of 
the crime.
[38]


UCPB further argues that since Section 31 of the Corporation Code refers
 to "all damages x x x suffered by the corporation" and considering that
 civil liability is not a penalty for the commission of a crime, the 
violation of Section 31 is not, by the words used in Section 144 of the 
Corporation Code, "specifically penalized therein."
[39]
 UCPB thus concludes that Section 144 should apply.
[40]


Moreover, UCPB cites the Decision of the Special Third Division of the CA in 
Ient v. Gonzalez and Tullett Prebon
[41]

 wherein the DOJ Secretary's directive to file an Information against 
corporate directors and officers for violation of Sections 31 and 34
[42]
 in relation to Section 144 of the Corporation Code was upheld.
[43]


UCPB's arguments are not persuasive enough for the Court to overturn or abandon its ruling in 
Ient
.
[44]


As mentioned at the outset, the Court has already ruled in 
Ient
 on the issue of the applicability of Section 144 to Section 31 of the Corporation Code. The Court, applying the rule of lenity,
[45]
 ruled in 
Ient

 that any violation of Section 31 of the Corporation Code was not 
considered as a violation of any provision of such Code not otherwise 
specifically penalized therein pursuant to Section 144. In other words, 
Section 144 did not apply to or include in its coverage Section 31 of 
the Corporation Code. The Court justified its ruling in 
Ient
, as follows:


After a meticulous consideration of the arguments presented 
by both sides, the Court comes to the conclusion that there is a textual
 ambiguity in Section 144; moreover, such ambiguity remains even after 
an examination of its legislative history and the use of other aids to 
statutory construction, necessitating the application of the rule of 
lenity in the case at bar.

x x x x

There is no provision in the Corporation Code using similarly emphatic 
language
[46]
 that evinces a 
categorical legislative intent to treat as a criminal offense each and 
every violation of that law. Consequently, there is no compelling reason
 for the Court to construe Section 144 as similarly employing the term 
"penalized" or "penalty" solely in terms of criminal liability.

x x x x

x x x We agree with petitioners that the lack of specific language 
imposing criminal liability in Sections 31 and 34 shows legislative 
intent to limit the consequences of their violation to the civil 
liabilities mentioned therein. Had it been the intention of the drafters
 of the law to define Sections 31 and 34 as offenses, they could have 
easily included similar language as that found in Section 74.
[47]


x x x x

xxx Sections 31 to 34 were introduced into the Corporation Code to 
define what acts are covered, as well as the consequences of such acts 
or omissions amounting to a failure to fulfill a director's or corporate
 officer's fiduciary duties to the corporation. A closer look at the 
subsequent deliberations on [Cabinet Bill (C.B.)] No. 3 [(the bill that 
was enacted into the Corporation Code)], particularly in relation to 
Sections 31 and 34, would show that the discussions focused on the civil
 liabilities or consequences prescribed in said provisions themselves. x
 x x

x x x x

Verily, in the instances that Sections 31 and 34 were taken up on the 
floor, legislators did not veer away from the civil consequences as 
stated within the four corners of these provisions. Contrasted with the 
interpellations on Section 74 (regarding the right to inspect the 
corporate records), the discussions on said provision leave no doubt 
that legislators intended both civil and penal liabilities to attach to 
corporate officers who violate the same x x x.

x x x x

Quite apart that no legislative intent to criminalize Sections 31 and 34
 was manifested in the deliberations on the Corporation Code, it is 
noteworthy from the same deliberations that legislators intended to 
codify the common law concepts of corporate opportunity and fiduciary 
obligations of corporate officers as found in American jurisprudence 
into said provisions. In common law, the remedies available in the event
 of a breach of director's fiduciary duties to the corporation are civil
 remedies. If a director or officer is found to have breached his duty 
of loyalty, an injunction may be issued or damages may be awarded. A 
corporate officer guilty of fraud or mismanagement may be held liable 
for lost profits. A disloyal agent may also suffer forfeiture of his 
compensation. There is nothing in the deliberations to indicate that 
drafters of the Corporation Code intended to deviate from common law 
practice and enforce the fiduciary obligations of directors and 
corporate officers through penal sanction aside from civil liability. On
 the contrary, there appears to be a concern among the drafters of the 
Corporation Code that even the imposition of the civil sanctions under 
Sections 31 and 34 might discourage competent persons from serving as 
directors in corporations.

x x x x

The Corporation Code was intended as a regulatory measure, not primarily
 as a penal statute. Sections 31 [and] 34 in particular were intended to
 impose exacting standards of fidelity on corporate officers and 
directors but without unduly impeding them in the discharge of their 
work with concerns of litigation. Considering the object and policy of 
the Corporation Code to encourage the use of the corporate entity as a 
vehicle for economic growth, we cannot espouse a strict construction of 
Sections 31 and 34 as penal offenses in relation to Section 144 in the 
absence of unambiguous statutory language and legislative intent to that
 effect.

When Congress intends to criminalize certain acts it does so in plain, 
categorical language, otherwise such a statute would be susceptible to 
constitutional attack. As earlier discussed, this can be readily seen 
from the text of Section 45(j) of Republic Act No. 8189 and Section 74 
of the Corporation Code.

We stress that had the Legislature intended to attach penal sanctions to
 Sections 31 and 34 of the Corporation Code it could have expressly 
stated such intent in the same manner that it did for Section 74 of the 
same Code.
[48]


In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the CA did not err in 
ruling that Section 144 of the Corporation Code did not cover or apply 
to Section 31 of the same Code.

With the passage of the RCC, will the Court arrive at the same ruling on
 the first issue as it did in 
Ient
 using the same legal 
framework? The answer will depend upon the factual milieu of the 
proceeding before the Court wherein the issue on the coverage or 
applicability of Section 170 to Section 30 of the RCC will be resolved. 
However, it must be noted, that under the RCC, there is now a provision 
on administrative sanctions that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(Commission) can impose if, after due notice and hearing, it finds that 
any provision of the RCC has been violated, 
viz
.:


SEC. 158. Administrative Sanctions. â If, after due notice 
and hearing, the Commission finds that any provision of this Code, rules
 or regulations, or any of the Commission's orders has been violated, 
the Commission may impose any or all of the following sanctions, taking 
into consideration the extent of participation, nature, effects, 
frequency and seriousness of the violation:

(a) Imposition of a fine ranging from Five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) to
 Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00), and not more than One thousand pesos
 (P1,000.00) for each day of continuing violation but in no case to 
exceed Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00);

(b) Issuance of a permanent cease and desist order;

(c) Suspension or revocation of the certificate of incorporation; and

(d) Dissolution of the corporation and forfeiture of its assets under 
the conditions in Title XIV of this Code.


The Court notes that the wording of the RCC reinforces the Court's 
interpretation that a violation of Section 31 of the Corporation Code, 
now Section 30 of the RCC, is not covered by Section 144 of the 
Corporation Code, now Section 170 of the RCC. While Section 170 of the 
RCC now clarifies that the said Section applies to 
"Other Violations of the Code"

 or "[violations of any of the other provisions of this Code or its 
amendments not otherwise specifically penalized therein" and provides 
for 
"Separate Liability"
 to the effect that "[l]iability for any 
of the foregoing offenses [or such violations] shall be separate from 
any other administrative, civil, or criminal liability under this Code 
and other laws," such language is still consistent with the violations 
contemplated under Section 144 of the Corporation Code â "[v]iolations 
of any of the provisions of this Code or its amendments not otherwise 
specifically penalized therein," the operative phrase "not otherwise 
specifically penalized therein" being retained. Also, the civil 
liability provided under Section 31 of the Corporation Code â "liable 
jointly and severally for all damages resulting therefrom suffered by 
the corporation, its stockholders or members and other persons" and 
"liable as a trustee for the corporation and must account for the 
profits which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation" â is 
phrased similarly in Section 30 of the RCC. In either Section, no 
administrative or criminal liability is provided. However, as stated 
earlier, under the RCC, there is now Section 158 on administrative 
sanctions, above quoted, that the Commission can impose if, after due 
notice and hearing, it finds that any provision of the RCC has been 
violated.

Thus, under the RCC, the Commission has now the authority to impose any 
or all of the foregoing sanctions in case "any provision of [the RCC,] 
rules or regulations, or any of the Commission's orders has been 
violated x x x, taking into consideration the extent of participation, 
nature, effects, frequency and seriousness of the violation."

As to the second issue, UCPB's argument is anchored on the applicability
 of Section 144 of the Corporation Code to Section 31.
[49]

 Since Section 144 provided as penalty imprisonment for not less than 30
 days but not more than 5 years, then the period of prescription, 
according to UCPB, should be 8 years for violations penalized under 
special laws by imprisonment for 2 years or more, but less than 6 years 
pursuant to Act No. 3326.
[50]
 
Citing Section 2 of Act No. 3326, which provides that "[prescription 
shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of 
the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery 
thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its 
investigation and punishment," UCPB posits that at the time of the 
commission of the alleged violation in 1998, there was no way that it 
could have taken action on the undue payment of bonuses because the 
recipients of the bonuses comprised the management of the bank with 
Antiporda and Carreon being the top two officers, and even when the bank
 changed administrations, 
i.e.
, from the administration of 
Antiporda and Carreon to the next administration, there was no way the 
new administration could have taken action against Antiporda and Carreon
 until it had evidentiary basis, which came through only with the KPMG 
report of 2003.
[51]
 To UCPB, 
the prescriptive period should have started to run only in 2003 when 
UCPB allegedly discovered the undue payment of bonuses from the KPMG 
report.
[52]


The Court having already ruled on the first issue that Section 144 of 
the Corporation Code did not include violations of Section 31 as 
"[violations of any provisions of [that] Code or its amendments not 
otherwise specifically penalize therein," wherein imprisonment for not 
less than 30 days but not more than 5 years was the imposable penalty, 
then Act No. 3326 is not the applicable law on prescription.

The liability of the erring director, trustee or officer under Section 
31 of the Corporation Code being purely civil, 
i.e.
, "all damages
 resulting [from its violation] suffered by the corporation, its 
stockholders or members and other persons," the Court holds that it is 
the Civil Code that is the controlling law. The Court thus agrees with 
the CA that it is Article 1146 of the Civil Code which determines the 
prescriptive period. It provides:


ART. 1146. The following actions must be instituted within four years:

(1) Upon an injury to the rights of the plaintiff;

(2) Upon a quasi-delict. (n)


To recall, the questioned bonuses were paid through 50 manager's checks 
amounting to P117,872,269.43, which were released to the concerned UCPB 
corporate officers and directors from April 6 to July 31, 1998. The KPMG
 special audit report
[53]
 was dated June 30, 2003. The Complaint-Affidavit of UCPB is dated July 23, 2007 and filed on even date with the DOJ.
[54]


Even if the Court were to uphold UCPB's actual discovery theory, the 
action upon the injury to its right under Section 31 of the Corporation 
Code or the damages that it had suffered by virtue of the alleged 
unauthorized payment of bonuses had prescribed on July 1, 2007 or four 
years from June 30, 2003, the purported day of actual discovery by UCPB.
 This is pursuant to 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Primetown Property Group, Inc.
,
[55]

 where the Court held that Section 31 of the Administrative Code of 
1987, which provides that "year" shall be understood to be twelve 
calendar months, governs the computation of periods, being the more 
recent law as compared to the Article 13 of the Civil Code, which 
provides that a year consists of 365 days. When UCPB thus filed its 
Complaint-Affidavit on July 23, 2007, the four years or 48 calendar 
months prescriptive period had already lapsed.

Under Article 1155 of the Civil Code, the prescription of actions is 
interrupted 
when they are filed before the court
, when there is a 
written extrajudicial deman
d
 by the creditors, and when there is any written acknowledgment of the 
debt by the debtor. The filing of the Complaint-Affidavit by UCPB with 
the DOJ did not interrupt the prescription of its action not only 
because this was beyond the 48 calendar months prescriptive period based
 on Section 31 of the Corporation Code, but also because it was not 
filed before the proper court and finally because the 
Complaint-Affidavit cannot even be deemed as an extrajudicial demand for
 damages given its prayer: "On the basis of the foregoing, [Antiporda 
and Carreon] should be held liable under 
Section 31, in relation to Section 144 of the Corporation Code
 for being guilty of gross bad faith/and/or gross negligence in directing the affairs of the corporation."
[56]
 Put simply, UCPB did not make a claim for any damage in the Complaint-Affidavit it filed.

Regarding the KPMG special audit report, the Court cannot make a determination based on the "Executive Summary"
[57]

 thereof, which UCPB attached to its Petition, that UCPB came to know of
 the payment of the questioned bonuses only on June 30, 2003. The 
"Executive Summary" merely mentions that UCPB "has been incurring net 
losses since 2000 x x x [and] its Audit Committee has recommended a 
special audit to determine the performance and accountabilities of the 
BOD and management, as appropriate, from 1986 to 2002;"
[58]

 and the primary objective of the special audit is: "to evaluate the 
performance and establish accountabilities of the BOD and management 
from 1986 to 2002.
[59]
 The 
unauthorized payment of the bonuses was not even mentioned therein. 
Thus, the actual discovery theory of UCPB does not even appear to have a
 factual leg to stand on.

Given that there is no factual basis from which actual discovery of the 
payment of the questioned bonuses by UCPB, assuming the same to have 
been concealed by Antiporda and Carreon, can be based and that, 
according to the CA, said payment had been widely and publicly known 
given that UCPB belongs to the heavily-regulated banking industry whose 
transactions are documented and audited by the BSP on a regular basis, 
the filing of the action for damages based on Section 31 of the 
Corporation Code had already prescribed 48 calendar months or 4 years 
from July 31, 1998, the last release date of the 50 manager's checks, at
 the latest.

Parenthetically, if the second issue is to be resolved under the aegis 
of the RCC and assuming that Section 170 applies to Section 30 of the 
RCC, prosecution of any violation of Section 30 prescribes in a year or 
12 calendar months pursuant to Section 1, Act No. 3326, given that the 
penalty of any Section 30 violation is fine only.

Disloyalty of a Director

 â Where a director, by virtue of his office, acquires for himself a 
business opportunity which should belong to the corporation, thereby

 has been ratified by a vote of the stockholders owning or representing 
at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding capital stock. This 
provision shall be applicable, notwithstanding the fact that the 
director risked his own funds in the venture.

[45]
 In American 
jurisprudence, the following are the two schools of thought regarding 
the application of the rule of lenity â a textually ambiguous penal 
statute being given more lenient interpretation in favor of a criminal 
defendant: (1) the rule is to be applied 
after
 resort to the 
language and structure, legislative history and motivating policies of 
the statute; and (2) the existence of textual ambiguity in the penal 
statute is sufficient for the rule's application,
