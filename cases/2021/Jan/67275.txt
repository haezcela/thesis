DELOS SANTOS, J.:


The Case


In determining whether a disease is compensable, it is enough that there exists a reasonable work connection.
[1]

 It is sufficient that the hypothesis on which the workmen's claim is 
based is probable since probability, not certainty is the touchstone.
[2]
 


This is to resolve the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[3]

 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of petitioner Jerome I. Mariveles 
(Mariveles) that seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision
[4]
 dated November 27, 2017 and the Resolution
[5]

 dated April 11, 2018, both of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 138754 and prays for the reinstatement of the Decision
[6]

 dated September 23, 2014 by the Office of the Voluntary Arbitrators 
(Arbitration Panel) of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board 
(NCMB) granting Mariveles disability benefits in the amount of US$ 
93,154.00 and 10% thereof as and for attorney's fees. 


The Facts


Mariveles was engaged by Wilhelmsen-Smithbell Manning, Inc., and the 
Wilhelmsen Ship Management, Ltd. (respondents) on April 8, 2013 as 
Able-Bodied Seaman on board the ship MV "Perseverance" with a basic 
monthly salary of US$ 689.00 for nine months, as indicated in the 
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) Contract of 
Employment. Prior to his deployment on March 19, 2013, Mariveles 
underwent preÂ­employment medical examination, and the physician's 
referral slip dated March 19, 2013 indicated that Mariveles had Cardiac 
Arrythmia (TET Impression). Respondents then referred Mariveles for 2D 
Echo with Doppler Study. However, despite such findings, on March 25, 
2013, respondents declared Mariveles fit to work, but the physician 
prescribed maintenance medicines for Mariveles' condition.
[7]
 


In November 2013, while on board the vessel, Mariveles experienced 
chest pain, dizziness, difficulty in sleeping and breathing. Mariveles 
immediately informed his officers of his condition. On November 18, 
2013, the ship captain referred Mariveles to a physician at the Canadian
 Specialist Hospital in Dubai for medical examination and treatment, and
 the physician diagnosed Mariveles to be suffering from "Coronary Artery
 Disease; Hyperlipidemia; Leukocytosis and Thrombocythemia; 
Hyperuricemia; and Hyperparathyroid Gland."
[8]

 Thereafter, Mariveles was confmed in the hospital from November 19, 
2013 to November 28, 2013, as indicated in the Medical Report. After 
discharge from the hospital, Mariveles was immediately repatriated to 
the Philippines.
[9]
 Upon 
arrival in the Philippines, Mariveles reported to respondents, and he 
was immediately referred to Marine Medical Services, where Dr. Esther G.
 Go (Dr. Go) examined and diagnosed Mariveles as suffering from 
"Coronary Artery Disease; SIP Percutaneous Coronary Intervention of the 
Right Coronary Artery - Right Posterolateral Branch; Essential 
Thrombocytosis; Dyslipidemia; and Hyperuricemia."
[10]
 On February 17, 2014, Dr. Go issued the Medical Certificate
[11]

 and assessed Mariveles' disability as Grade 7 - moderate residual or 
disorder. Subsequently, Mariveles consulted Dr. Leonardo Raymundo (Dr. 
Raymundo), an independent physician, and as indicated in the Medical 
Certificate dated April 29, 2014 executed bDr. Raymundo, Mariveles was 
"unfit to withstand the [rigors] of sea duty."
[12]


Mariveles instituted grievance proceedings at the Associated Marine 
Officers and Seamen's Union of the Philippines. Thereafter, he requested
 the referral of the case to the NCMB for mediation conferences. Since 
the parties failed to settle, the case was elevated to Arbitration 
Panel, and the Arbitration Panel eventually ordered the submission of 
the parties' respective pleadings.
[13]
 


In his Position Paper,
[14]
 
Mariveles enumerated some of his material and substantial duties being 
an Able-Bodied Seaman which includes "performing navigational 
[watchkeeping] and gangway [watchkeeping], performing duties of a 
[lookout] and helmsman; keeping the bridge and the gangway clean, and 
obey the orders of the deck [officer-in-charge] when carrying out 
maintenance or using navigation equipment, accessories in rescue boats, 
lifesaving appliances, pilot ladder, steering gear and other bridge 
accessories; perform duties assigned and guide ordinary seamen."
[15]
 Moreover, in his Rejoinder,
[16]

 Mariveles also asseverated that he had no choice of what to eat on 
board except those provided on the vessel which consisted mainly of 
high-fat, high-cholesterol, and low fiber food and that the work of a 
seafarer is generally strenuous and demanding. Such working conditions 
and the food provided to them on board surely caused his illness.
[17]


The Arbitration Panel's Ruling


In a Decision
[18]
 dated 
September 23, 2014, the Arbitration Panel found Mariveles totally and 
permanently disabled because of the coronary artery disease he suffered 
while on board the vessel MV "Perseverance," and granted him disability 
benefits and attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the Decision 
reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby 
rendered ordering respondents Wi1helmsen-Smith Bell Manning, Inc. and 
Wilhelmsen Ship Management Ltd., to pay jointly and solidarily, 
complainant Jerome I. Mariveles, the amount of NINETY[-]THREE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY[-]FOUR US DOLLARS (US$ 93,154.00) representing total 
permanent disability benefits, and ten percent (10%) thereof as and for 
attorney's fees.


All other claims are dismissed for lack of merit. 


SO ORDERED.
[19]


On November 13, 2014, respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[20]
 on the aforementioned Decision.


On December 9, 2014, the Arbitration Panel denied respondents' Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit.


Not satisfied with the Arbitration Panel's Decision, respondents filed a Petition for Review with the CA. 


The CA Ruling


In a Decision
[21]
 dated 
November 27, 2017, the CA set aside the Decision issued by the 
Arbitration Panel and instead, dismissed the complaint filed by 
Mariveles.


The CA ruled that the Arbitration Panel erred in ruling that Mariveles' illness (Coronary Artery Disease) was work-related.


 Under the POEA Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC), for a 
disability to be compensable, two requisites must be present: (1) the 
injury or illness must be work-related; and (2) the work-related injury 
or illness must have existed during the term of the seafarer's 
employment contract.
[22]
 The 
absence of any of the elements would not justify a disability award. The
 CA ruled that even though Mariveles was diagnosed with Coronary Artery 
Disease, he failed to adduce substantial evidence to show that his 
illness was work-related.
[23]


 Although Section 32-A of POEA-SEC lists heart disease as an 
occupational disease which is compensable, the mere inclusion of heart 
disease in the list did not 
ipso facto
 mean that all heart 
diseases are workÂ­related. As clearly defined by the POEA-SEC, a 
work-related illness refers to "any sickness resulting to disability or 
death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A 
of this contract with the conditions set therein satisfied." To be truly
 considered as an occupational disease, other than its inclusion under 
Section 32-A, the claimant must likewise prove that the conditions laid 
down by said provision are met. Otherwise, the claimed illness cannot be
 regarded as work-related.
[24]


 In this case, Mariveles was not able to prove the existence of the 
conditions in Section 32-A(ll) of POEA-SEC. He did not present clear 
evidence which could show a reasonable connection that his heart disease
 was caused by his job as Able-Bodied Seaman. There was no evidence to 
prove that Mariveles' conditions contributed to the development of the 
heart disease. In the absence of evidence, the CA ruled that they cannot
 presume that Mariveles' job as Able-Bodied Seaman had a direct causal 
connection in the development of his heart disease.
[25]


 Furthermore, the CA ruled that the Arbitration Panel erred in ruling
 that Mariveles was entitled to total and permanent disability benefits 
under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Under Article 20.1.3 of
 the CBA, disability compensation may be awarded when the disability 
arose as a result of work-related illness, or from an accident. Since 
Mariveles failed to substantiate the causal connection between his 
alleged illness and his job as Able-Bodied Seaman, and since there was 
no accident in this case, Mariveles was not entitled to disability 
compensation under the CBA.
[26]
 


Refusing to concede, on April 27, 2018, Mariveles filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[27]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court raising the following issues: 


The [CA] committed a serious error of law when it 
held that petitioner is not entitled to disability compensation as the 
illness is allegedly not work-related;



The [CA] committed grave error of law when it allowed the petition; and



Whether or not [Mariveles] is deemed to be totally and permanently disabled.
[28]


On June 20, 2018, the Court issued a Resolution
[29]
 requiring the respondents to file their Comment within 10 days from notice.


In their Comment,
[30]
 
respondents argued that the Petition should be dismissed for failing to 
raise questions of law. They alleged that in his Petition, Mariveles has
 not raised questions of law, but only questions of facts, thus, the 
Petition must be dismissed outright.
[31]
 


Respondents also rebutted Mariveles' argument that the CA committed a
 serious error of law when it held that Mariveles is not entitled to 
disability compensation as the illness is allegedly not work-related. 
Respondents emphasized that the company-designated physician 
categorically opined that Mariveles' illnesses are not work-related. 
Moreover, Mariveles failed to show the connection between the 
development of his diagnosed illness and the nature of his job as 
Able-Bodied Seaman.
[32]
 


On November 21, 2018, the Court issued a Resolution requiring Mariveles to file a Reply within 10 days from receipt of notice.
[33]
 On March 6, 2019, Mariveles, through his counsel, received a copy of such Resolution.


 In his Reply,
[34]
 
Mariveles submitted that he raised a question of law as there is doubt as
 to what law is applicable based on the facts presented by the parties 
especially that the Arbitration Panel and the CA decided on the matter 
differently. Mariveles also argued that work aggravation of an illness 
is considered compensable under the POEA-SEC. Mariveles cited 
More Maritime Agencies v. National Labor Relations Commission
,
[35]

 wherein the Court stated that compensability of an ailment does not 
depend on whether the injury or disease was pre-existing at the time of 
the employment, but rather if the disease or injury is work-related and 
aggravated his condition. Finally, Mariveles alleged that the CA 
committed grave error of law when it allowed respondents to belatedly 
file their petition before the CA. The petition, being filed out of 
time, is a mere scrap of paper and deserved no consideration at all. 
Hence, the CA's act of allowing the Petition amounted to grave abuse of 
discretion without or in excess of jurisdiction. 


The Court's Ruling


The fundamental issue that the Court must resolve is whether Mariveles is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.


Preliminarily, it must be emphasized that this Court is not a trier 
of facts and as general rule, only questions of law raised via a 
Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are reviewable 
by this Court.
[36]
 Factual 
findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, including labor 
tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are 
specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction 
especially when these are supported by substantial evidence.
[37]

 The rule, however, is not ironclad and a departure therefrom may be 
warranted where the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to the 
findings and conclusions of the trial court or quasiÂ­ judicial agency, 
as in this case.
[38]
 Thus, the Court is constrained to review and resolve the factual issue in order to settle the controversy.


 The present case before us involves the claim for permanent and 
total disability benefits of a seafarer, Mariveles. Mariveles argues 
that contrary to the findings of the CA, his illness is work-related and
 therefore, he is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.


He is.


 The entitlement of an overseas seafarer to disability benefits is 
governed by law, the employment contract, and the medical findings.
[39]

 By law, the seafarer's disability benefits claim is governed by 
Articles 197 to 199 (formerly Articles 191 to 193), under Chapter VI 
(Disability Benefits), Book IV of the Labor Code, in relation to Rule X 
of the Rules and Regulations Implementing Book IV of the Labor Code.
[40]

 By contract, it is governed by the employment contract which the 
seafarer and his employer/local manning agency executed prior to 
employment, and the applicable POEA-SEC that is deemed incorporated in 
the employment contract. Lastly, the medical findings of the 
company-designated physician, the seafarer's personal physician, and 
those of the mutually-agreed third physician, pursuant to the POEA-SEC, 
govern.
[41]
 In this case, 
Mariveles executed his employment contract with respondents during the 
effectivity of the 2010 POEA-SEC; hence, its provisions are applicable 
and should govern their relations.


 Before we discuss the merits of this case, there is a need to 
elucidate certain concepts relevant to a seafarer's compensation. The 
Court emphasizes that there exists a fme line between the 
work-relatedness of an illness and the matter of compensability. The 
former concept merely relates to the assumption that the seafarer's 
illness, 
albeit
 not listed as an occupational disease, may have 
been contracted during and in connection with one's work, whereas 
compensability pertains to the entitlement to receive compensation and 
benefits upon as showing that his work conditions caused or at least 
increased the risk of contracting the disease.
[42]


 In 
Romana v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation
,
[43]
 the Court clarified the confusion between work-relatedness and compensability. To wit: 


To address this apparent confusion, the Court thus 
clarifies that there lies a technical demarcation between 
work-relatedness and compensability relative to how these concepts 
operate in the realm of disability compensation. As discussed, 
work-relatedness of an illness is presumed; hence, the seafarer does not
 bear the initial burden of proving the same. Rather, it is the employer
 who bears the burden of disputing this presumption. If the employer 
successfully proves that the illness suffered by the seafarer was 
contracted outside of his work (meaning, the illness is pre-existing), 
or that although the illness is pre-existing, none of the conditions of 
his work affected the risk of contracting or aggravating such illness, 
then there is no need to go into the matter of whether or not said 
illness is compensable. As the name itself implies, work-relatedness 
means that the seafarer's illness has a possible connection to one's 
work, and thus, allows the seafarer to claim disability benefits 
therefor, albeit the same is not listed as an occupational disease.


The established work-relatedness of an illness does not, however, 
mean that the resulting disability is automatically compensable. As also
 discussed, the seafarer, while not needing to prove the 
work-relatedness of his illness, bears the burden of proving compliance 
with the conditions of compensability under Section [32-A] of the 2000 
POEA-SEC. Failure to do so will result in the dismissal of his claim. 


For disability to be compensable under Section 20(A) of the Amended 
Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of 
Filipino Seafarers on-Board Ocean-Going Ships issued on October 26, 2010
 (2010 POEA-SEC), two elements must concur: (1) the injury or illness 
must be work-related; and (2) the work-related injury or illness must 
have existed during the term of the seafarer's employment contract.
[44]

 A work-related illness is defined as "any sickness as a result of an 
occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this Contract with the
 conditions set therein satisfied."
[45]
 Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC reads:


SEC. 32-A. OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES


 For an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to
 be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied: 


The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein;



The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks;



The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it; and



There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.


Section 32-A(11) of the 2010 POEA-SEC lists cardiovascular disease as a 
compensable work-related condition. For cardiovascular disease to be 
considered as an occupational disease, sub-item number 11, Section 32-A 
of the 2010 POEA-SEC requires any of the following conditions to be met:


If the heart disease was known to have been present 
during employment, there must be proof that an acute exacerbation was 
clearly precipitated by an unusual strain by reasons of the nature of 
his work;



The strain of work that brings about an acute attack must be 
sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical
 signs of a cardiac insult to constitute causal relationship;



If a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being 
subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of cardiac injury 
during the performance of his work and such symptoms and signs 
persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship;



If a person is a known hypertensive or diabetic, he should show
 compliance with prescribed maintenance medications and doctorÂ­ 
recommended lifestyle changes. The employer shall provide a workplace 
conducive for such compliance in accordance with Section l(A) paragraph 
5; [and]



In a patient not known to have hypertension or diabetes, as indicated on his last Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME).


Thus, to be truly considered as an occupational disease, other than 
its inclusion under Section 32-A, the claimant must likewise prove that 
the conditions laid down by said provision are met. Otherwise, the 
claimed illness cannot be regarded as work-related.


Moreover, Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC commands that the employee
 seeking disability benefits submit himself to post-employment medical 
examination by a company-designated physician within three working days 
from his repatriation.


 Therefore, to summarize, when a seafarer seeks to claim the 
compensation and benefits that Section 20(A) of the POEA-SEC grants to 
him, the law requires the seafarer to prove that: 


 
 
1)
 
 
He suffered an illness; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)
 
 
He suffered this illness during the term of his employment contract;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3) 
 
He complied with the procedures prescribed under Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4)
 
 
His illness is one of the enumerated occupational disease or that his illness or injury is otherwise work-related; and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5) 
 
He
 complied with the four conditions enumerated under Section 32(A) for an
 occupational disease or a disputably-presumed workÂ­related disease to 
be compensable.
[46]
 
 


Applying the foregoing guidelines, the Court disagrees with the ruling of the CA and grants Mariveles' Petition.


 
Mariveles' illness is work-related;

probability, not certainty is the

touchstone.


 In this case, Mariveles was found to be suffering from Coronary 
Artery Disease which is considered as an occupational disease pertaining
 to Cardiovascular Diseases. In several cases, cardiovascular disease, 
coronary artery disease, as well as other heart ailments were held to be
 compensable.
[47]
 In 
Magsaysay Mitsui OSK Marine, Inc. v. Bengson
,
[48]
 the Court summarized its previous rulings as follows: 


In many cases decided in the past, this Court has held that 
cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and other heart 
ailments are compensable. Thus, in 
Fil-Pride Shipping Company, Inc. v. Balasta
,
 severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease which the seaman contracted 
while serving as Able Seaman was considered an occupational disease. In 
Villanueva, Sr. v. Baliwag Navigation
, Inc., it was held that the 2000 POEA-SEC considers heart disease as an occupational disease. In 
Jebsens Maritime, Inc. v. Undag
, the Court held that hypertensive cardiovascular disease may be a compensable illness, upon proof. In 
Oriental Shipmanagement Co., Inc. v. Bastol
 and 
Heirs of the late Aniban v. National Labor Relations Commission
, it was held that myocardial infarction as a disease or cause of death is compensable, such being occupational. 
Floreta v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc
.
 held that hypertensive cardiovascular disease/coronary artery disease 
and chronic stable angina are compensable. Micronesia Resources v. 
Cantomayor stated that a finding of coronary artery disease entitles the
 claimant - a seaman Third Officer-to disability compensation. In 
Remigio v. National Labor Relations Commission
,
 the Court held that the claimantâa musician on board an ocean-going 
vessel -was entitled to recover for suffering from coronary artery 
disease. In 
Sepulveda v. Employees' Compensation Commission
, it 
was declared that the employee's illness, myocardial infarction, was 
directly brought about by his employment as schoolteacher or was a 
result of the nature of such employment. (Citations omitted)


As previously discussed, the POEA-SEC provides as a condition for a 
known Coronary Artery Disease to be compensable that there is proof that
 an acute exacerbation was precipitated by the unusual strain of the 
seafarer's work. Hence, despite the presumption, the Court has held 
that, on due process grounds, the claimant-seafarer must still prove by 
substantial evidence that his work conditions caused, or at least 
increased, the risk of contracting the disease, as awards of 
compensation cannot rest entirely on bare assertions and presumptions.
[49]

 In this light, the claimant must prove, not that his illness is 
work-related, but that the same is ultimately compensable by satisfying 
the conditions for compensability under Section 32-A of the 2010 
POEA-SEC.


Applying the foregoing, the Court finds that, contrary to the ruling 
of the CA, Mariveles is entitled to disability benefits for his Coronary
 Artery Disease.


 The Court does not agree with the CA when it ruled that Mariveles 
failed to adduce substantial evidence to show that his illness was 
workÂ­related. A careful review of the records of this case shows that 
Mariveles was able to meet the required degree of proof that his illness
 is compensable as it is work-related. In his Position Paper
[50]
 and Rejoinder,
[51]

 Mariveles enumerated some of his material and substantial duties as an 
Able-Bodied Seaman and explained his poor diet which consisted mainly of
 high-fat, high-cholesterol, and low fiber food. Aside from his working 
condition and poor diet, seafarers like Mariveles are exposed to the 
harsh conditions of the sea, long hours of work, stress, and loneliness 
brought about by being away from their families. His working condition, 
poor diet, and stressful nature of his employment, would all lead to the
 conclusion that the work of petitioner as Able-Bodied Seaman caused or 
contributed even to a small degree to the development or aggravation of 
his heart disease. In determining whether a disease is compensable, it 
is enough that there exists a reasonable work connection.
[52]

 It is sufficient that the hypothesis on which the workmen's claim is 
based is probable since probability, not certainty is the touchstone.
[53]


 In sum, Mariveles is entitled to be awarded the total and permanent disability benefits that he seeks.


 While the Court need not discuss the other issues raised in the 
Petition, the Court fmds that this is an opportune time to reiterate the
 rule on the correct period for appealing the decision or award of the 
Arbitration Panel. 


The petition for review shall be filed

within 15 days pursuant to Section 4,

Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.
 


In resolving whether or not the CA committed grave abuse of 
discretion, the Court has to first determine the period to timely file 
an appeal from the decision or award by the Arbitration Panel.


 Mariveles posits that respondents' Petition for Review before the CA
 was filed out of time because the rule is that an Arbitration Panel's 
Decision shall be appealed before the CA within 10 days from receipt of 
the award of decision in accordance with Article 262-A (renumbered as 
Article 276)
[54]
 of the Labor Code. Since respondents filed its Petition for Review on January 21, 2015 or the 15
th

 day from the time of receipt of the Resolution of the Arbitration 
Panel, then the CA should have dismissed the Petition as it was not 
filed within the period provided for by Article 262-A of the Labor Code.


We do not agree.


 In 
Guagua National Colleges v. Court of Appeals
,
[55]

 this Court has finally clarified the variable rulings of the Court 
regarding the period to be followed in appealing the decisions or awards
 of the Arbitration Panel. It thoroughly discussed which between the two
 periods found in Article 262-A (now Article 276) of the Labor Code and 
Section 4, Rule 43 ofthe Rules of Court governs the appeal from the 
decision or award by the Arbitration Panel. The Court ruled: 


In the 2010 ruling in 
Teng v. Pagahac
, the Court 
clarified that the 10-day period set in Article 276 of the Labor Code 
gave the aggrieved parties the opportunity to file their motion for 
reconsideration, which was more in keeping with the principle of 
exhaustion of administrative remedies, holding thusly:


 In the exercise of its power to promulgate implementing rules and 
regulations, an implementing agency, such as the Department of Labor, is
 restricted from going beyond the terms of the law it seeks to 
implement; it should neither modify nor improve the law. The agency 
formulating the rules and guidelines cannot exceed the statutory 
authority granted to it by the legislature.


 By allowing a 10-day period, the obvious intent of Congress in 
amending Article 263 to Article 262-A is to provide an opportunity for 
the party adversely affected by the VA's decision to seek recourse [via]
 a motion for reconsideration or a petition for review under Rule 43 of 
the Rules of Court filed with the CA. Indeed, a motion for 
reconsideration is the more appropriate remedy in line with the doctrine
 of exhaustion of administrative remedies. For this reason, an appeal 
from administrative agencies to the CA [via] Rule 43 ofthe Rules of 
Court requires exhaustion of available remedies as a condition precedent
 to a petition under that Rule.


The requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted is based on
 the doctrine that in providing for a remedy before an administrative 
agency, every opportunity must be given to the agency to resolve the 
matter and to exhaust all opportunities for a resolution under the given
 remedy before bringing an action in, or resorting to, the courts of 
justice. Where Congress has not clearly required exhaustion, sound 
judicial discretion governs, guided by congressional intent.


By disallowing reconsideration of the VA's decision, Section 7, Rule 
XIX of DO 40-03 and Section 7 of the 2005 Procedural Guidelines went 
directly against the legislative intent behind Article 262-A of the 
Labor Code. These rules deny the VA the chance to correct himself and 
compel the courts of justice to prematurely intervene with the action of
 an administrative agency entrusted with the adjudication of 
controversies coming under its special knowledge, training and specific 
field of expertise. In this era of clogged court dockets, the need for 
specialized administrative agencies with the special knowledge, 
experience and capability to hear and determine promptly disputes on 
technical matters or intricate questions of facts, subject to judicial 
review, is indispensable. In 
Industrial Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
,
 we ruled that relief must first be obtained in an administrative 
proceeding before a remedy will be supplied by the courts even though 
the matter is within the proper jurisdiction of a court.


 
Hence, the 10-day period stated in Article 276 should be 
understood as the period within which the party adversely affected by 
the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrators or Panel of Arbitrators may file
 a motion for reconsideration. Only after the resolution of the motion 
for reconsideration may the aggrieved party appeal to the CA by filing 
the petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court within 15 
days from notice pursuant to Section 4 of Rule 43.

Following the ruling of the Court in 
Guagua National Colleges
,
 we ruled that the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting
 to lack or in excess of its jurisdiction when it allowed and acted on 
the respondents' position because it was filed within 15 days pursuant 
to Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. The 10-day period under 
Article 276 of the Labor Code refers to the filing of a motion for 
reconsideration 
vis-a-vis
 the Arbitration Panel's Decision or award.


In view of the foregoing disquisitions, the Court, therefore, affirms
 the compensability of Mariveles' permanent disability. The amount of 
US$ 93,154.00 is justified under Section 32 of the POEA-SEC as Mariveles
 suffered from permanent and total disability. The grant of attorney's 
fees is likewise affirmed for being justified in accordance with Article
 2208(2)
[57]
 of the New Civil Code since Mariveles was compelled to litigate to satisfy his claim for disability benefits. 


WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of petitioner Jerome I. Mariveles is 
GRANTED
.
 Consequently, the Decision dated November 27, 2017 and the Resolution 
dated April 11, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 138754 
are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
 and the Decision dated 
September 23, 2014 of the Office of the Voluntary Arbitrators of the 
National Conciliation and Mediation Board granting Mariveles disability 
benefits in the amount of US$ 93,154.00 and 10% thereof as and for 
attorney's fees, is 
REINSTATED
. 


SO ORDERED.
