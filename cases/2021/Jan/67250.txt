MIGUEL D. GOCOLAY, PETITIONER, VS.MICHAEL BENJO GOCOLAY, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




LEONEN, J.:


For a supervening event to stay a final and executory order, the 
event must be shown to have materially changed the parties' situation or
 altered the order's substance, rendering execution inequitable.

 This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 and Resolution
[3]

 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR. SP No. 137096. The Court of Appeals 
annulled and set aside the Regional Trial Court's March 31, 2014 and 
June 20, 2014 Orders, which granted Miguel Gocolay's motion to dismiss 
or recall the trial court's April 21, 2008 and April 1, 2009 Orders 
requiring him to undergo DNA testing to determine Michael Gocolay's 
paternity.


In 2005, Michael Benjo Gocolay (Michael) filed with the Regional 
Trial Court a petition for paternity, seeking to be recognized as a 
biological and nonmarital
[4]
 
son of Miguel Gocolay (Miguel). According to Michael, his mother 
Priscilla Castor (Priscilla) met Miguel in 1976, and had a romantic 
relationship with him which resulted in a pregnancy. When Michael was 
born, Miguel allegedly promised to support him and Priscilla, but he 
never did. In support of his petition, Michael presented his birth 
certificate, which named Miguel as his father and stated that Priscilla 
and Miguel were married.
[5]


 In Miguel's answer, he denied having a child with Priscilla. He also
 claimed that the statements in Michael's birth certificate regarding 
Michael's father and his and Priscilla's marital status were falsified.
[6]
 


During the trial, Michael filed a Motion for DNA Examination/Testing,
 which Miguel opposed on the ground that DNA testing would violate his 
right against involuntary servitude and self-incrimination. The Regional
 Trial Court granted the motion, which Miguel appealed, until the case 
reached this Court, which ultimately affirmed the grant in 2012.
[7]
 


Then, on November 18, 2013, Miguel filed a motion to dismiss or to 
recall the orders allowing the conduct of DNA testing. In his motion, he
 alleged that a supervening event occurred in that Priscilla had been 
charged and pled guilty of violating Presidential Decree No. 651,
[8]

 for making false entries in Michael's birth certificate. To Miguel, 
Priscilla's conviction showed that the birth certificate could no longer
 be used to establish a 
prima facie
 case for paternity that would support DNA testing.
[9]
 


On March 31, 2014, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order granting 
Miguel's motion. It found that Michael's birth certificate could no 
longer be relied upon as basis for ordering Miguel to undergo DNA 
testing. As such, there was no 
prima facie
 case in Michael's favor. Michael's motion for partial reconsideration was denied on June 20, 2014.
[10]
 


Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the Regional
 Trial Court's March 31, 2014 and June 20, 2014 Orders. The dispositive 
portion of the Court of Appeals' May 28, 2015 Decision stated: 


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Orders dated 
March 31, 2014 and June 20, 2014 of public respondent Regional Trial 
Court, Branch 18, Tagaytay City, are hereby 
ANNULLED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Accordingly, the court 
a quo
 is 
DIRECTED
 to set the date for the conduct of the DNA exarnination.
[11]
 (Emphasis in the original) 


The Court of Appeals held that Priscilla pleading guilty to violating
 Presidential Decree No. 651 was not a supervening event that could 
modifY the fmal and executory order to conduct DNA testing. When the 
appellate court examined that criminal case, it found that Priscilla's 
specific criminal act was making it appear in Michael's birth 
certificate that she and Miguel were married at the time of Michael's 
birth, which they were not. This false entry did not render the other 
entries in the birth certificate false, or change the other entries in 
it, especially the entry where Miguel was named Michael's father. It 
only changed Michael's status from a marital to a nonmarital chiId.
[12]
 


Moreover, to the Court of Appeals, the birth certificate was not the only piece of evidence that would show a 
prima facie

 case for Michael's paternity. During trial, Priscilla had testified on 
her sexual relationship with Miguel, her pregnancy, and Michael's birth.
 Both the birth certificate and Priscilla's testimony constitute the 
prima facie
 case that supported the final and executory orders to conduct DNA testing.
[13]
 


Finally, it noted that Miguel had belatedly raised Priscilla's 
criminal act as a supervening event. She was convicted by the 
Metropolitan Trial Court on June 18, 2012, while the entry of judgment 
that rendered final and executory the order to conduct DNA testing was 
issued by the Supreme Court on August 3, 2012. Yet, Miguel only raised 
Priscilla's conviction one year later, or on November 18, 2013. Even 
Michael's motion for the setting of the date of DNA testing was filed 
earlier, on November 4, 2013. To the Court of Appeals, Miguel's failure 
to promptly bring the court's attention to the existence of a 
supervening event should be deemed his waiver of that defense. Thus, the
 Regional Trial Court erred in granting Miguel's Motion.
[14]
 


The Court of Appeals denied Miguel's motion for reconsideration on September 7, 2015.
[15]
 


Hence, this Petition. Petitioner argues that Priscilla's criminal act
 was a supervening event that modified a final and executory judgment. 
He claims that he did not provide the information in the birth 
certificate and did not sign it. To him, if Priscilla could lie about 
their marital status, then she could have conceivably lied about 
respondent's paternity.
[16]
 


Petitioner further claims that since respondent's birth certificate 
contained false entries, then respondent had not established a 
prima facie

 case for his paternity and filiation. He points to Articles 172 and 175
 of the Family Code, which provide that a birth certificate is among the
 ways by which children may establish their marital and nonmarital 
filiation. Moreover, Priscilla's testimony on her alleged relationship 
with petitioner was self-serving and uncorroborated.
[17]
 Thus, in accordance with 
Lucas v. Lucas
,
[18]
 there is no evidence that would support the issuance of a DNA testing order.


 In his Comment,
[19]
 
respondent argues that the Court of Appeals correctly found that 
Priscilla's conviction was not a supervening event which will defeat the
 immutability of the judgment on the order for DNA testing. According to
 him, petitioner's motion to dismiss or recall the DNA testing orders 
functioned as a second motion for reconsideration, prohibited under the 
Rule 37, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, seeking to overturn a ruling 
already entered into judgment by no less than this Court.
[20]
 


He also argues that Priscilla's conviction did not affect the entire 
birth certificate, but only the falsified entries. Respondent's claim 
for paternity was also supported by Priscilla's testimony as to her and 
petitioner's sexual relations, consistent with this Court's ruling in 
Herrera v. Alba
.
[21


]
 In his Reply,
[22]

 petitioner reiterates his claim that the doctrine of immutability of 
judgment did not apply to this case, and that Priscilla's conviction 
following her admission of guilt was a timely raised supervening event. 
Because Priscilla's conviction tarnished the birth certificate itself, 
there is now insufficient evidence to support a 
prima facie
 case to justify the DNA testing.
[23]


 The issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not Priscilla 
Castor's conviction for making false entries in Michael Gocolay's 
Certificate of Live Birth is a supervening event that warrants the 
setting aside of the final and executory Regional Trial Court Orders for
 the DNA testing of Michael Gocolay and Miguel Gocolay.


When a judgment attains finality, it becomes immutable and 
unalterable, resisting even correction due to perceived errors of law or
 fact. Execution of the judgment becomes a matter of course. In 
Mercury Drug Corp. v. Spouses Huang:
[24]




A final and executory judgment produces certain effects. 
Winning litigants are entitled to the satisfaction of the judgment 
through a writ of execution. On the other hand, courts are barred from 
modifying the rights and obligations of the parties, which had been 
adjudicated upon. They have the ministerial duty to issue a writ of 
execution to enforce the judgment.


 It is a fundamental principle that a judgment that lapses into 
finality becomes immutable and unalterable. The primary consequence of 
this principle is that the judgment may no longer be modified or amended
 by any court in any manner even if the purpose of the modification or 
amendment is to correct perceived errors of law or fact. This principle 
known as the doctrine of immutability of judgment is a matter of sound 
public policy, which rests upon the practical consideration that every 
litigation must come to an end.


 The rationale behind the rule was further explained in 
Social Security System v. Isip
, thus: 


The doctrine of immutability and inalterability of a final judgment 
has a two-fold purpose: (1) to avoid delay in the administration of 
justice and thus, procedurally, to make orderly the discharge of 
judicial business and (2) to put an end to judicial controversies, at 
the risk of occasional errors, which is precisely why courts exist. 
Controversies cannot drag on indefinitely. The rights and obligations of
 every litigant must not hang in suspense for an indefinite period of 
time.
[25]
 (Citations omitted) 




One exception to the immutability of judgments is when there exists a
 supervening event, or "facts which transpire after judgment has become 
final and executory or to new circumstances which developed after the 
judgment has acquired finality, including matters which the parties were
 not aware of prior to or during the trial as they were not yet in 
existence at that time."
[26]
 A supervening event renders the execution of the judgment impossible or unjust,
[27]
 requiring new relief to be granted as the new facts or circumstances warrant.
[28]
 


For a supervening event to be an exception to the execution of a 
final judgment, the following must concur: first, the fact or 
circumstance must occur after the judgment became fmal and executory; 
and second, the fact or circumstance must be shown to affect or change 
the judgment's substance, making its execution inequitable.
[29]


 This Court has upheld the stay of execution of final and executory 
judgments in cases where orders for reinstatement to a previous position
 were no longer feasible,
[30]
 or where court decisions changing the execution of prior ones are promulgated.
[31]


 Conversely, this Court does not consider to be supervening event 
facts and circumstances that arose before the judgment became final and 
executory, but were only raised after.
[32]

 Further, if the fact or circumstance did not materially change the 
parties' situation and did not materially affect the execution ofthe 
judgment, it cannot be considered a supervening event.
[33]
 An instance would be the death of a party, as they may be substituted by heirs.
[34]
 


In this case, the final and executory nature of the Regional Trial 
Court's April 21, 2008 and April 1, 2009 Orders requiring the parties to
 undergo DNA testing is undisputed.


When the trial court granted respondent's motion, petitioner 
questioned the trial court's rulings in both the Court of Appeals and 
this Court, and was routed in both forums. Eventually, this Court denied
 petitioner's motion for reconsideration in that case, G.R. No. 200540, 
and entry of judgment was issued.
[35]

 Yet, in another attempt to defeat the Regional Trial Court's Orders, 
petitioner now comes before this Court with an allegation that, because 
the mother of his putative child pled guilty to making false entries in 
the child's birth certificate, he is entitled not to undergo DNA 
testing.


Petitioner is mistaken.


Priscilla's conviction for violating Presidential Decree No. 651 did 
not occur after the Regional Trial Court's April 21, 2008 and April 1, 
2009 Orders became final and executory. The Quezon City Metropolitan 
Trial Court handed down its judgment of conviction against Priscilla on 
June 19, 2012.
[36]
 At that 
time, G.R. No. 200540 had not yet been resolved with finality. This 
Court only issued its Resolution denying petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration eight days after, or on June 27, 2012. Indeed, the entry
 of judgment for G.R. No. 200540 was dated August 3, 2012.
[37]


 If petitioner had only been so inclined, and more assuredly vigilant
 in the vindication of his rights, he could have raised with this Court,
 in G.R. No. 200540, the existence of the pending case against 
Priscilla-but he did not. Instead, he waited for more than a year, after
 respondent moved for the setting of the DNA testing, before belatedly 
raising Priscilla's conviction as a so-called supervening event. As held
 by the Court of Appeals, petitioner failing to seasonably raise a 
defense that he could have raised at the earliest opportunity amounts to
 a waiver of that defense.
[38]


 More importantly, Priscilla's conviction did not materially change 
the parties' situation as to warrant recalling the April 21, 2008 and 
April 1, 2009 Orders. 


 The Information filed against Priscilla, and to which she pled guilty, stated: 


That on or about the 23rd day of March 1979, in Quezon 
City, Philippines, the said accused, being then the mother of MICHEL 
BENJO C. GOCOLAY and informant in the latter's birth certificate, did 
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and deliberately 
make false statements in said Birth form by then and there 
stating 
therein that a marriage was solemnized between her and one MIGUEL D. 
GOCOLAY in Bulacan on May 1978 and that the aforesaid MICHEL BENJO C. 
GOCOLAY is their legitimate child when in truth and in fact, accused 
knew fully that said informations and entries were false as MIGUEL D. 
GOCOLAY is not married to PRISCILLA GOCOLAY but to MARIE D. GOCOLAY
,
 after which said accused presented the same for registration at the 
Local Civil Registry of Quezon City and was registered as Local Civil 
Registry No. 2448, in violation of law.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
[39]
 (Emphasis supplied) 


Based on the Information, the false entry in respondent's birth 
certificate referred to Priscilla's claim that she was married to 
petitioner. Nothing about this defeats respondent's claim for paternity 
and filiation. Marriage between respondents' parents is not 
indispensable to establish the identity of his putative father. As 
correctly pointed out by the Court of be Appeals, it only affects his 
status, foreclosing the possibility that he could be a marital child of 
petitioner, but leaving the door open to him being petitioner's 
nonmarital child, in accordance with the definitions of "legitimate" and
 "illegitimate" children in our civil laws.
[40]
 


Even so, Priscilla's conviction does not undermine the ultimate 
allegations made by respondent. In his original petition for paternity, 
respondent clearly alleged that he was the "illegitimate and biological 
son of Respondent Miguel Gocolay and PRISCILLA A. CASTOR[.]
[41]

 This allegation has not been altered or modified in anyway by the false
 entry in respondent's birth certificate; in fact, petitioner and 
Priscilla not being married to each other corresponds with respondent's 
claim that he is petitioner's "illegitimate and biological son."


 The false entry in respondent's birth certificate did not undermine 
his claim to be recognized as petitioner's nonmarital son. Moreover, 
both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found Priscilla's 
testimony that she and petitioner had sexual relations resulting in a 
child to be sufficient. Reexamining her testimony at so late a stage 
would be tantamount to a prohibited second motion for reconsideration of
 a final and executory order.
[42]
 A reasonable possibility of paternity
[43]
 has already been established with finality. Thus, respondent's 
prima facie
 case for a DNA test must be upheld.


As no element of a supervening event occurs in this case which would 
warrant the staying of the final and executory April 21, 2008 and April 
1, 2009 Orders, respondent is entitled to their execution.
