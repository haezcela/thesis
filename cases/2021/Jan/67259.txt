DECISION


LEONEN, J.:


 It is the Court of Tax Appeals, and not the regional trial courts, 
that has the jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality and validity 
of revenue issuances by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 


 This Court resolves a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Court of Appeals' Decision
[2]
 and Resolution
[3]
 granting the appeal from the Order
[4]
 and Resolution
[5]

 of the Regional Trial Court, which declared Revenue Memorandum Order 
No. 20-2013 (RMO No. 20-2013) unconstitutional and Revenue Memorandum 
Circular No. 52-2013 (RMC No. 52-2013) illegal.
[6]


 In July 2013, Commissioner of Internal Revenue Kim S. JacintoÂ­ 
Henares (Commissioner Jacinto-Henares) issued RMO No. 20-2013, which 
provided the guidelines in the processing of tax exemption applications 
and the re-validation of tax exemption rulings and certificates of 
corporations listed under Section 30 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code.
[7]
 


A month later, Commissioner Jacinto-Henares issued RMC No. 52-2013, 
which clarified the validity of unused and unissued principal and 
supplementary receipts or invoices printed before January 18, 2013.
[8]

 The circular set deadlines for their validity; beyond the dates 
specified, the receipts and invoices would no longer be valid. Thus, 
taxpayers were required to secure new authority to print receipts or 
invoices.
[9]


 On November 13, 2013, Revenue District Officer Rene Detablan 
(Detablan) wrote a letter to St. Mary's Academy of Caloocan City (St. 
Mary's Academy), informing it of its failure to apply for a new 
authority to print. He also reminded the academy that under RMC No. 
52-2013, its receipts were no longer valid as of October 31, 2013, and 
that subsequent issuance ofreceipts starting November 1, 2013 without an
 authority to print violated the National Internal Revenue Code. Thus, 
Detablan demanded that St. Mary's Academy pay the penalty should it fail
 to show its new authority to print.
[10]
 


 In response, St. Mary's Academy said that it was a non-stock, nonÂ­ 
profit educational institution that was "exempt from taxes and 
duties[.]"
[11]
 It cited 
Revenue Ruling No. 159-98, which states that non-stock, non-profit 
educational institutions were exempt from issuance of receipts and sales
 invoices printed with the permission and stamp of the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue.
[12]
 Even if 
this ruling were or would be revoked, St. Mary's Academy maintained that
 it would still not be compelled to apply for a new authority to print, 
as that is only required for entities doing business.
[13]


 Detablan referred the matter to Regional Director Gerardo R. 
Florendo (Florendo). Florendo, in tum, wrote St. Mary's Academy saying 
that it was not exempt from applying for a new authority to print He 
explained that the regulation not only covers principal receipts and 
invoices, but also supplementary ones such as delivery receipts, 
collection receipts, and other documents, which St. Mary's Academy 
issues. The requirement was merely intended for recording, monitoring, 
and control purposes.
[14]
 


Florendo also insisted that St. Mary's Academy had to renew its 
application for tax exemption as a non-stock, non-profit educational 
institution under RMO No. 20-2013.
[15]

 Thus, St. Mary's Academy filed before the Regional Trial Court of 
Quezon City a Petition for Injunction and Prohibition against 
Commissioner Jacinto-Henares, Detablan, and Florendo. It alleged that as
 a non-stock, non-profit educational institution, all its assets and 
revenues "actually, directly, and exclusively used for educational 
purposes"
[16]
 were exempt from
 internal revenue taxes. It also claimed that it was not engaged in 
business and was not required to secure an authority to print receipts 
and invoices Despite this, the Bureau of Internal Revenue required it to
 surrender and destroy its official receipts and apply for a new 
authority to print When it did not do so, the Bureau of Internal Revenue
 allegedly imposed a penalty of P10,000.00 for non-registration, and an 
additional penalty of P20,000.00 for every receipt printed without 
authority.
[18]
 


Thus, St. Mary's Academy prayed that RMC No. 52-2013 and RMO No. 
20-2013, insofar as they cover non-stock, non-profit educational 
institutions, should be declared unconstitutional and illega.
[19]


 Defending the assailed issuances, Commissioner Jacinto-Henares, 
Detablan, and Florendo countered that they were made pursuant to the 
Commissioner's rule-making power. Accordingly, they said that injunction
 and prohibition are inapplicable remedies as they only apply to acts 
done in the exercise of judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial 
functions.
[20]
 They prayed 
that the Petition be dismissed for lack of merit and for violating the 
doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.
[21]


 The Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor
 General, filed its separate Comment, saying that the Petition was 
premature for raising no justiciable controversy. It argued that no 
sanction has been imposed on St. Mary's Academy at the time it filed the
 case.
[22]
 


On June 26, 2014, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order
[23]

 granting the prayer for preliminary injunction. It found that St. 
Mary's Academy did not need to apply for an authority to print since it 
was not subject to internal revenue taxes and was not engaged in 
business. It also ruled that Commissioner Jacinto-Henares had no 
authority to amend provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code by 
requiring additional documents before a tax-exempt entity such as St. 
Mary's Academy could enjoy this status.
[24]
 The dispositive portion of the Order reads: 


WHEREFORE, a Preliminary Injunction is hereby ISSUED to 
refrain RESPONDENTS and/or any of its representatives and agents from 
implementing Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 52-2013 and Revenue 
Memorandum Order No. 20-2013 with respect to non-stock non-profit 
educational institution, upon posting of the petitioner of a bond in the
 amount of TWO MILLION PESOS (P2,000,000.00).



SO ORDERED.
[25]




Commissioner Jacinto-Henares, Detablan, Flores, and the Republic moved 
for reconsideration of the Order, while St. Mary's Academy moved for the
 submission of the case for decision on the merits.
[26]


Subsequently, on October 10, 2014, the Regional Trial Court issued a Resolution
[27]
 declaring the issuances unconstitutional. The dispositive portion of the Order reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court orders: 


 
 
1) 
 
RMO
 20-2013 is hereby declared as UNCONSTITUTIONAL insofar as it is made to
 apply to non-stock and non-profit educational institutions and  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2) 
 
RMC
 52-201[3] ILLEGAL insofar as it is made to apply to non-stock and 
non-profit educational institutions as it is (sic) runs counter to 
Sections 237 and 238 of the National Internal Revenue Code.
 
 


SO ORDERED.
[28]


After a failed motion for reconsideration,
[29]
 Commissioner JacintoÂ­ Henares, Detablan, Florendo, and the Republic lodged their appeal. In its August 31, 2016 Decision,
[30]

 the Court of Appeals granted the appeal and set aside the Regional 
Trial Court's Order and Resolution. It dismissed St. Mary's Academy's 
Petition for injunction and prohibition.
[31]
 


 Preliminarily, the Court of Appeals held that Commissioner 
JacintoÂ­Henares, in issuing the assailed issuances, was exercising her 
rule-making power under Section 4 of the National Internal Revenue Code.
 She "did not act in any judicial, quasi-judicial ... or ministerial 
capacity";
[32]
 hence, there 
could not have been a violation of the rule on exhaustion of 
administrative remedies, since this principle only applies when the 
administrative agency concerned performs a quasi-judicial function.
[33]


 Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals ruled that St. Mary's Academy's 
Petition should be dismissed. It held that Rule 58 and Rule 65 of the 
Rules of Court say that injunction and prohibition, respectively, are 
unavailing when the acts sought to be enjoined had already been 
accomplished, as in the assailed issuances.
[34]

 Additionally, it noted that the writ of prohibition, which is directed 
against judicial, quasi-judicial, and ministerial acts, cannot be issued
 against the assailed issuances, which were issued pursuant to the 
Commissioner's quasi-legislative power.
[35]
 


The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads: 


WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The assailed Order(s) in 
Civil Case No. R-QZN-13-06083-CV are SET ASIDE for being null and void 
and therein petition is DISMISSED. No costs.
[36]


St. Mary's Academy moved for reconsideration, but the Court of Appeals dismissed its Motion in its March 1, 2017 Resolution.
[37]
 Hence, St. Mary's Academy filed this Petition.
[38]
 


Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals for deciding on the appeal 
purely on procedural grounds and failing to tackle the substantive 
issues.
[39]
 


On procedural grounds, petitioner argues that "[t]he Court of Appeals
 should have dismissed the appeal" since there was "no genuine issue of 
fact presented."
[40]
 
Respondents, it says, only belatedly contrived on appeal that it failed 
to exhaust administrative remedies so as to make it appear that a 
factual issue was involved.
[41]

 Since the appeal only raised questions of law, the Court of Appeals 
should have dismissed it outright, the proper remedy being a Rule 45 
petition directly filed with this Court.
[42]


 Moreover, petitioner insists that it properly raised the question of
 constitutionality through a petition for injunction and prohibition 
because of the courts' expanded powers of judicial review under the 
Constitution. It maintains that courts now have the power to determine 
grave abuse of discretion even when the act complained of was not done 
in the exercise of judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial functions.
[43]


 Further, petitioner argues that courts exercising their expanded 
judicial powers are not confined in cases for certiorari, but also in 
petitions for prohibition.
[44]

 Thus, it asserts that while respondent Commissioner Jacinto-Henares 
issued the regulations in her rule-making power, grave abuse of 
discretion may still be abated and corrected in an action for injunction
 and prohibition.
[45]
 It 
argues that the courts' expanded power of judicial review is not 
diminished even if the assailed act was done pursuant to a 
quasi-legislative power.
[46]


 Petitioner further claims that it brought its case before the 
Regional Trial Court pursuant to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. It
 says that it did so out of prudence in case a factual issue may arise; 
but it turns out that there was none.
[47]


 On the substantive issues, petitioner maintains its tax-exempt 
status as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution and how the 
assailed regulations erode this privilege under Article XIV, Section 
4(3) of the Constitution.
[48]



Particularly, petitioner maintains the unconstitutionality of RMC No. 
52-2013, insofar as it invalidates previous receipts or invoices, thus 
requiring all institutions, including non-stock, non-profit educational 
institutions, to apply for a new authority to print. The regulation, it 
says, assumes that the institution applying for an authority to print is
 already subject to internal tax revenue, and it is up to the 
institution to prove its taxÂ­ exempt status.
[49]


 Since the regulation imposes a penalty of P20,000.00 per transaction for receipts printed without an authority to print,
[50]

 petitioner claims that it would incur millions in penalty, more so as 
it now uses computer-generated receipts for its transactions.
[51]


 Citing 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. VG. Sinco
,
[52]

 petitioner asserts that respondent Commissioner cannot impose 
additional requirements before a non-stock, non-profit educational 
institution can enjoy its tax-exempt status.
[53]

 Petitioner cites a previous issuance, Department of Finance Order No. 
137-87, which exempts non-stock, non-profit institutions from the 
issuance of receipts and sales invoices.
[54]
 This exemption, petitioner says, means they should not be required to apply for authority to print receipts or invoices.
[55]
 


As to RMO No. 20-2013, which requires institutions to apply for tax 
exemption rulings, petitioner insists that this is also impermissible 
for imposing an additional requirement not found in the Constitution.
[56]

 It claims that it is already required to file an annual information 
return, from which the Bureau of Internal Revenue can assess whether it 
continues to operate as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution.
[57]

 This, it claims, is enough to safeguard the government's interest, and 
an additional requirement would be superfluous and unconstitutional.
[58]

 According to petitioner, its failure to secure a ruling under this 
regulation would result in it losing its tax-exempt status, and would 
subject it to income tax for all of its activities.
[59]
 


Finally, petitiioner asserts that it has presented its clear and 
unmistakable rights which are at risk of being violated by the 
questioned regulations. Thus, the relief of injunction is proper.
[60]
 


In their Comment
[61]
 filed 
by the Office of the Solicitor General, respondents mainly argue that 
tax exemptions are strictly construed against the persons claiming them.
 They say that enjoyment may be regulated to ensure that only those 
entitled to it are granted exempt status.
[62]
 


 Moreover, respondents insist that the questioned issuances did not a1nend, alter, or modify the National Internal Revenue Code.
[63]

 They were issued only "for the orderly recording, monitoring and 
control of receipts" issued by all entities, whether taxable or 
tax-exempt.
[64]
 To respondents, this is a policy decision in implementing tax laws, which is outside the scope of a court's review powers.
[65]
 


Respondents maintain that the questioned issuances "did not erode petitioner's tax-exempt status"
[66]

 since any claims for tax exemption must be substantiated. The issuances
 merely provided the framework for petitioner, and all other tax-exempt 
entities similarly situated, to substantiate its claim for validation.
[67]


 The documentary submissions, respondents insist, are not additional requirements.
[68]

 These are only required for monitoring and recording purposes, and for 
the State to examine whether the entities are still compliant with the 
constitutional requirement for their enjoyment of their tax-exempt 
status.
[69]
 Respondents 
further maintain that the issuances are reasonable regulations, as they 
aim to prevent abuse of entities' tax-exempt status by requiring them to
 renew tax exemption rulings that cover them.
[70]


 Finally, respondents claim that petitioner has not shown a clear 
legal right that it sought to be protected. According to them, 
injunctions are not proper if the right asserted is dubious or is 
disputed.
[71]


 The main issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not RMO No.
 20-2013 and RMC No. 52-2013 are constitutional and valid. Before 
passing on this issue, however, this Court must first resolve whether or
 not the Regional Trial Court had jurisdiction to hear this case.


Petitioner resorted to the remedy of injunction and prohibition which
 it filed before the Regional Trial Court. While the use of this remedy 
to question administrative tax issuances is proper, the forum where it 
was filed is not. The Regional Trial Court does not have the power to 
rule on the validity or constitutionality of the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue's administrative issuances pertaining to the 
enforcement of the National Internal Revenue Code. It is the Court of 
Tax Appeals that has the jurisdiction to rule on these matters.


 Jurisdiction is "the power and authority of a court to hear, try[,] and decide a case."
[72]

 It is conferred by law. Questions on a court's jurisdiction "may be 
raised at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal. In fact, courts 
may take cognizance of the issue even if not raised by the parties 
themselves."
[73]
 


 Petitioner argues that the regular court has jurisdiction to rule on
 the validity and constitutionality of administrative issuances. 
However, the law creating the Court of Tax Appeals is clear. Republic 
Act No. 1125, as amended by Republic Act No. 9282, states in Section 7:


SECTION 7. 
Jurisdiction
. - The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise: 
(a) exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided: 


 
 
(1) 
 
Decisions
 of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed 
assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, 
penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under 
the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of Law 
administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue[.]
 
 


This Court has previously applied this provision to emphasize that it
 is the Court of Tax Appeals, and not the regional trial courts, that 
has jurisdiction over questions on the validity of tax issuances by the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 


In 
Blaquera v. Rodriguez
,
[74]

 a taxpayer filed a complaint before the Court of First Instance seeking
 to enjoin the Collector of Internal Revenue from collecting deficiency 
percentage taxes and from levying on execution any of the taxpayer's 
property to satisfy the tax liability. This Court ruled that the Court 
of First Instance did not have jurisdiction to hear the case; instead, 
it should have been brought on appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals, 
pursuant to Section 7 ofRepublic Act No. 1125.


 In 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Leal
,
[75]

 the taxpayer questioned, through a petition for prohibition filed 
before the Regional Trial Court, a revenue memorandum order and a 
revenue memorandum circular that imposed lending investor's tax on 
pawnshops and subjected pawn tickets to documentary stamp tax. Leal 
again applied Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 to emphasize that the 
jurisdiction over these cases questioning the Commissioner oflnternal 
Revenue's issuances lies with the Court of Tax Appeals, not the regular 
courts. This Court declared the Regional Trial Court's ruling as void 
for being issued without jurisdiction.
[76]


Subsequently, in 
Asia International Auctioneers v. Parayno
,
[77]

 the issue on jurisdiction again arose when a taxpayer questioned a 
revenue memorandum circular before the Regional Trial Court and prayed 
for its nullity. Citing both 
Blaquera
 and 
Leal
, this Court
 reiterated that the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to 
review rulings or opinions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It 
then refused to rule on the merits, saying it "would only prove futile. 
Having declared the court 
a quo
 without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the instant case, any further disquisition would be 
obiter dictum
."
[78]


 However, a year after 
Asia International Auctioneers, this Court decided British American Tobacco v. Camacho
,
[79]

 which petitioner cites as authority. There, this Court allowed the 
taxpayer to question revenue regulations and a revenue memorandum 
circular before the Regional Trial Court through a petition for 
injunction, as the Court of Tax Appeals' jurisdiction does not include 
cases where the constitutionality of a law or rule is challenged. Thus: 


Where what is assailed is the validity or constitutionality 
of a law, or a rule or regulation issued by the administrative agency in
 the performance of its quasi-legislative function, the regular courts 
have jurisdiction to pass upon the same.
[80]


British American Tobacco was a deviation from the rulings in Blaquera, Leal, and Asia International Auctioneers
.


 This conflict has been resolved in 
Banco de Oro v. Republic
.
[81]
 
Banco de Oro
 acknowledged the deviation and reverted to the earlier rulings in 
Blaquera, Leal, and Asia International Auctioneers
. This Court said: 



The Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the 
constitutionality or validity of tax laws, rules and regulations, and 
other administrative issuances of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
[82]




This is now the prevailing rule, as affirmed m 
COURAGE v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
.
[83]


Thus, when petitioner filed its Petition before the Regional Trial 
Court to question the constitutionality and validity of RMO No. 20-2013 
and RMC No. 52-2013, it brought its case before the wrong court. The 
Regional Trial Court did not have jurisdiction to pass upon such issues,
 as it is the Court of Tax Appeals that can decide on them.




Consequently, the Regional Trial Court's Resolution declaring RMO No.
 20-2013 as unconstitutional and RMC No. 52-2013 as invalid is void. It 
was then incorrect for the Court of Appeals to rule on the propriety of 
issuing an injunction or a writ of prohibition, as the case should have 
been dismissed outright by the Regional Trial Court for lack of 
jurisdiction.


Before this Court exercises its review powers, especially when the 
issue involves the constitutionality and validity of an act of a 
co-equal branch of government, the case must first be heard on both the 
law and the facts by the appropriate trial court. The law has determined
 this to be the Court of Tax Appeals.
