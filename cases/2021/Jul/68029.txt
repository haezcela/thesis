LEONEN, J.:


Tobacco products are undoubtedly "
health products
" 
within the definition provided under Republic Act No. 9711, or the Food 
and Drug Administration Act of 2009, due to their harmful effects on 
health. As to their health aspect, tobacco products fall under the 
regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration.
 This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Regional Trial Court's ruling,
[1]

 which nullified certain provisions of the Rules and Regulations 
Implementing Republic Act No. 9711 insofar as it regulates tobacco 
products and the tobacco industry. 
 In 1963, the Food and Drug 
Administration was established under the Department of Health per 
Republic Act No. 3720, or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It was 
tasked with administering and implementing laws that guarantee "the 
safety and purity of foods, drugs and cosmetics being made available to 
the public."
[2]
 The agency was abolished in 1982, and its functions were undertaken by the Bureau of Food and Drugs.
[3]
 In 1987, certain provisions of Republic Act No. 3720 were amended by Executive Order No. 175.
[4]
 In 2009, Republic Act No. 9711 was enacted to reinforce the regulatory capacity of the Bureau,
[5]
 which was then renamed the Food and Drug Administration,
[6]
 now holding regulatory authority over all health products.
[7]
 
 In 2011, following Section 22 of the law,
[8]

 the Department of Health, in coordination with the Food and Drug 
Administration, promulgated the pertinent Implementing Rules and 
Regulations of Republic Act No. 9711 (Implementing Rules). 
 The 
controversy in this case arose when the Philippine Tobacco Institute, 
Inc. (PTI) filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief with Application for 
the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary
 Injunction
[9]
 before the 
Regional Trial Court. PTI sought to prohibit the enforcement of the 
Implementing Rules, and to declare it void for disregarding Republic Act
 No. 9711 and Republic Act No. 9211, or the Tobacco Regulation Act of 
2003.
[10]
 
 PTI argued 
that under Republic Act No. 9211, the Inter-Agency Committee Tobacco 
(IAC-Tobacco) had exclusive jurisdiction over tobacco products,
[11]
 including its health aspect.
[12]

 It also contended that Section 25 of the Republic Act No. 9711 
explicitly prohibited the Food and Drug Administration from taking 
cognizance of health products already regulated by other agencies.
[13]
 The provision states:
  


 SECTION 25. 
Coverage
. â This Act shall govern all health products: 
Provided
,
 That nothing in this Act shall be deemed to modify the sole and 
exclusive jurisdiction of other specialized agencies and special laws 
only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws,
 including, but not limited to, those covered by Republic Act No. 9211, 
Executive Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree
 No. 1468. 




 PTI added that per congressional deliberations, the legislature 
intended to exclude tobacco products from the Food and Drug 
Administration's regulatory power.
[14]

 It argued that even if the Health Secretary was designated as the 
permanent Vice Chairperson of the IAC-Tobacco under Republic Act No. 
9211, the Department of Health's authority over tobacco products is 
limited to its membership in the committee;
[15]
 as such, it could not allegedly issue rules on tobacco products and the tobacco industry.
[16]
 

 PTI then contested Book II, Article III of the Implementing Rules, 
which classified tobacco products as "health products," placing them 
under the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory authority.
[17]
 It states:
 
BOOK II
 
ARTICLE III
 

    Tobacco and Other Products




 SECTION 1. Rationale. â The FDA has full jurisdiction over the regulation of all health products. 


 SECTION 2. Tobacco. â The DOH, tasked with protecting the 
public's health against the injurious effects arising from the use of 
tobacco and tobacco products, has the responsibility of regulating 
tobacco and tobacco products through the FDA. 


 	Rules and Other Issuances to Implement this Section. Within a
 reasonable period from the date of effectivity of these Rules and 
Regulations, the FDA shall prepare and recommend for the approval to the
 Secretary of Health, the appropriate rules and regulations and other 
issuances to implement this Section.
 
 Protection against Tobacco Industry Interference. The FDA 
shall act to protect the formulation and implementation of rules and 
regulations under this Section from commercial and other vested 
interests of the tobacco industry, including organizations, entities, 
associations, individuals, and others that work to further the interests
 of the tobacco industry. 


 The FDA shall not deal with the tobacco industry or individuals 
or entities that work to further the interests of the tobacco industry, 
except to the extent strictly necessary to effectively regulate, 
supervise, or control the tobacco industry in relation to tobacco and 
tobacco products. 


 SECTION 3. Other Products. â Nothing in the FDA Act of 2009 
shall be deemed to modify the jurisdiction of other specialized agencies
 and special laws only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized 
agencies and laws except the health aspects of such products. 


 SECTION 4. Identification of Policy Areas. â The FDA shall 
promulgate the appropriate rules and regulations and other issuances to 
identify and define the policy areas that are not covered by specialized
 agencies and special laws, including, but not limited to, those covered
 by Republic Act No. 9211, Executive Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 
18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468. 




 PTI similarly pointed out that the restriction in the dealings 
between the Food and Drug Administration and the tobacco industry under 
Section 2(b), paragraph 2 above not only lacked statutory basis, but 
also violated the equal protection clause.
[18]

 Limiting the Food and Drug Administration's interaction with the 
tobacco industry only on matters necessary for effective regulation 
"unduly discriminate[d] against the tobacco industry and ma[de] an 
invalid classification as it fail[ed] to impose the same burden on other
 private industries with interest in other health products regulated by 
the  [Food and Drug Administration]."
[19]


 PTI also assailed Book II, Articles I, II, and V
[20]

 of the Implementing Rules, which cover tobacco products. PTI argued 
that under Republic Act No. 9211, the IAC-Tobacco had "jurisdiction over
 the regulation of labeling, advertisements, promotions, sponsorships 
and marketing activities involving tobacco products."
[21]
 The assailed provisions state: 
  
BOOK II




 
ARTICLE I
 

  Licensing of Establishments and Registration of Health Products






 SECTION 1. General Provisions. â


 The manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for
 sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising,
 or sponsorship of any health product without the proper authorization 
from the FDA is prohibited. 




 . . . .






 
 
ARTICLE II
 

  Labeling of Health Products






 SECTION 1. General Provision. â Consistent with the state policy
 of protecting the consumer against hazards to health and safety and 
providing information and education to facilitate sound choice in the 
proper exercise of their rights, all health products must be labeled and
 conform to the requirements on labeling set by the FDA. 


 . . . .




 
 
ARTICLE V
 

  Advertisements, Promotions, Sponsorship, and Other Marketing Activities






 SECTION 1. General Provision. â Consistent with the state policy
 of protecting the consumer against misleading, deceptive, false, 
erroneous impression regarding any health product's character, value, 
quantity, composition, merit, or safety, efficacy or quality, and in 
order to provide information and education to facilitate sound choice in
 the proper exercise of their rights, all advertisements, promotions, 
sponsorship, and other marketing activities about the health product 
must adhere to the standards, guidelines, and regulations of the FDA. 
For this purpose, advertisements, promotions, sponsorship, and other 
marketing activities on health products shall refer to those addressed 
to the general public in any form of media. 


 SECTION 2.	General Rules on Advertisements, Promotions, Sponsorship, and Other Marketing Activities of any Health Product. â


	No health product that has not been registered or authorized 
shall be advertised, promoted or subjected to any marketing activities;
 No claim in the advertisement, promotion and sponsorship, and
 other marketing activities shall be made other than those contained in 
the approved label or packaging of the health product, or as duly 
approved by the FDA[.]




 On the other hand, the Department of Health and the Food and Drug 
Administration insisted on the valid exercise of their rule-making power
[22]

 and regulatory authority over tobacco products. They argued that 
tobacco products were allegedly "health products" under Section 10(ff) 
of Republic Act No. 3720, as amended by Republic Act No. 9711, due to 
their detrimental effects to health.
[23]
 Section 10(ff) states: 
  


 SECTION 10. For the purposes of this Act, the term: 


 (ff) 'Health products' means food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, 
biologicals, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and household/urban 
hazardous substances and/or a combination of and/or a derivative 
thereof. 
It shall also refer to products that may have an effect on health which require regulations as determined by the FDA
. (Emphasis supplied) 




 They added that under Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711, the 
Food and Drug Administration allegedly "retain[ed] jurisdiction over all
 health products (including tobacco products) on matters that are not 
covered by special laws."
[24]
 
They denied stripping the IAC-Tobacco of its exclusive authority to 
implement Republic Act No. 9211, the latter's powers being distinct from
 them.
[25]
 
 As to the 
protection against tobacco industry interference, the Department of 
Health and the Food and Drug Administration contended that the 
Implementing Rules were allegedly "consistent with the State's 
constitutional mandate to protect public health, as recognized in the 
various provisions of the [World Health Organization Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC)]."
[26]
 
 On September 28, 2011, the Regional Trial Court denied PTI's move for injunction,
[27]
 and on December 15, 2011, denied its move for reconsideration.
[28]
 
 Later, in a January 27, 2012 Decision,
[29]
 the Regional Trial Court ruled on the merits and granted
[30]

 PTI's petition. Relying on Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711, it 
declared that tobacco products were expressly excluded from the coverage
 of the law, and hence, beyond the ambit of the Food and Drug 
Administration's regulatory power. Recognizing the IAC-Tobacco's 
exclusive jurisdiction over tobacco products under Republic Act No. 
9211, the trial court ruled that it was improper for the Department of 
Health and the Food and Drug Administration to include tobacco products 
under Book II, Article III of the Implementing Rules. It also agreed 
with PTI that the other contested provisions, which consequently applied
 to tobacco products, would encroach on IAC-Tobacco's authority over the
 same activities under Republic Act No. 9211.
[31]

 The trial court also explained that Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711
 conformed with existing statutes, particularly with Republic Act No. 
9211, the "primary law on regulating tobacco products."
[32]

 It pointed out that congressional deliberations relevant to the 
enactment of Republic Act No. 9711 recognized the IAC-Tobacco's 
exclusive authority over tobacco products, citing the following 
testimony of Atty. Emilio Polig (Atty. Polig), Head of the Food and Drug
 Administration's Legal Department:
  


 MR. POLIG (Head, Legal Department, Bureau of Food and Drugs) 
Yes, Madam-Chairman. While the definition on health products, 
particularly the last portion, practically covers every . . . every pro .
 . . other products that may have an effect on health on it is my . . . 
my opinion that since the . . . the law on that covers like tobacco is a
 special law, separate . . . hindi na po siya kasama dito Your Honor. 
(Exhibit D 45-46).
[33]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 The trial court ruled that the Department of Health, as a member 
of the IAC-Tobacco through the Food and Drug Administration, could only 
regulate tobacco products through the IAC-Tobacco by providing inputs 
and proposals for the body's deliberation. Thus, it declared that the 
Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration exceeded their
 rule-making powers in including the contested provisions of the 
Implementing Rules.
[34]
 The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Decision reads: 
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED. 
The Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9711, insofar as it 
regulates tobacco products and the tobacco industry is declared void. 
Public Respondents Department of Health and Food and Drug Administration
 are hereby directed to refrain from enforcing the	 Implementing Rules 
and Regulations on tobacco products and the tobacco industry. 


 SO ORDERED.
[35]




 On March 29, 2012, the Department of Health and the Food and Drug 
Administration, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed this 
Petition for Review.
[36]
 On August 28, 2012, PTI filed its Comment
[37]
 to the Petition.

 On April 11, 2013, petitioners-intervenors Senators Pilar Juliana S. 
Cayetano and Franklin M. Drilon filed their Petition-in-Intervention.
[38]
 
 On December 17, 2013, respondent-intervenor Representative Edcel C. Lagman filed his Opposition-in-Intervention.
[39]
 On September 9, 2014, this Court required the parties and intervenors to file their memoranda.
[40]
 
 Petitioners insist on the valid exercise of their regulatory powers.
[41]

 To them, Section 25 clearly says that Republic Act No. 9711 governs all
 health products except those matters covered by special laws. Hence, 
the Food and Drug Administration allegedly retained its regulatory 
powers over tobacco products on matters affecting public health, which 
are not covered by Republic Act No. 9211.
[42]

 Moreover, congressional deliberations allegedly reveal the lawmakers' 
intent to grant the Food and Drug Administration authority over the 
health aspects of all products, including tobacco.
[43]
 

 Petitioners repeat that due to their effects on health, tobacco 
products are "health products" under Section 10(ff) of Republic Act No. 
3720, as amended, and thus fall under the regulatory authority of the 
Department of Health through the Food and Drug Administration.
[44]

 This is despite the lack of a center under Section 5 of Republic Act 
No. 3720, as amended, which regulates tobacco products. After all, for 
petitioners, the Food and Drug Administration is empowered to create 
additional organizational units.
[45]
 

 Petitioners emphasize that the Department of Health's primary 
responsibilities of formulating and implementing health policies and 
programs were neither amended nor repealed by Republic Act No. 9211.
[46]

 Republic Act No. 9711, on the other hand, was enacted to strengthen the
 State's regulatory and enforcement capacity over health products.
[47]
 These laws do not confuse or merge the functions of the Food and Drug Administration and the IAC-Tobacco, petitioners say.
[48]


 Petitioners also explain
[49]

 that of Book II, Article III, Section 2(b), paragraph 2 of the 
Implementing Rules on protection against tobacco industry interference 
is consistent with Department Memorandum Order No. 2010-0126
[50]
 and Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2010-01,
[51]

 and conforms to the Philippines' obligations under the WHO FCTC to 
protect public health policies from the vested interests of the tobacco 
industry.
[52]


 Moreover, petitioners argue that the tobacco industry's 
distinct classification allegedly rests on valid and reasonable 
standards and do not violate the equal protection clause.
[53]
 

 To these, petitioners-intervenors add that Section 25 of Republic Act 
No. 9711 did not diminish petitioners' powers to promulgate rules and 
regulations over tobacco products.
[54]

 The proviso allegedly provides a limitation only insofar as certain 
acts have been covered by the special laws and agencies specified.
[55]

 As to acts not covered, including the health aspect of tobacco 
products, they say that the law has suppletory application and that 
these remain within the regulatory authority of petitioners.
[56]
 
 Petitioners-intervenors also contend that Republic Act No. 9211 does not address all obligations required under the WHO FCTC.
[57]

 It "regulates only certain aspects [of the tobacco industry], 
particularly sale and distribution, signages, smoke-free places, textual
 warnings on cigarette packages, advertisements, promotions and 
sponsorship."
[58]
 The 
IAC-Tobacco's task is merely compliance monitoring and program 
development, petitioners-intervenors say, while the implementation of 
programs and projects lies with the member-agencies of the IAC-Tobacco.
[59]

 Also citing congressional deliberations, petitioners-intervenors argue 
that "the consensus of the legislators was to include tobacco products 
within the coverage of [Republic Act No. 9711] and the regulatory 
authority of the [Food and Drug Administration.]"
[60]

 They add that the trial court erroneously relied on a mere opinion by 
Atty. Polig, as cited by respondent, which was also just a portion of 
the deliberations of the Bicameral Committee on February 23, 2009 and is
 not the intent of the Committee.
[61]

 Petitioners-intervenors echo petitioners in that tobacco products 
undeniably qualify as "health products" for their detrimental effects on
 health.
[62]
 They say that 
ejusdem generis

 only applies in case of ambiguity and would not be "controlling where 
the plain purpose and intent of the Legislature would thereby be 
hindered and defeated."
[63]
 
Restricting the law's coverage only to the list under the definition of 
health products or of the same class as the latter, they say, would 
defeat the law's very objective.
[64]

 On the other hand, respondent counters that Republic Act No. 9211 
bestows on the IAC-Tobacco the exclusive jurisdiction to regulate 
tobacco products, which includes their health aspect.
[65]

 It asserts that the Department of Health cannot regulate tobacco 
products on its own, and that its authority is limited to being part of 
IAC-Tobacco.
[66]
 
 In 
contrast to what petitioners say, respondent argues that Republic Act 
No. 9711, as supported by congressional deliberations, points to the 
legislative intent to exclude tobacco products from the coverage of the 
law.
[67]
 Likewise, tobacco 
products are allegedly not health products, they not being mentioned in 
Republic Act No. 9711, nor was there a specific center created under the
 law to regulate it.
[68]
 

 Respondent also argues that Section 25 of the law delimited the Food 
and Drug Administration's jurisdiction by explicitly divesting it of 
power over matters already under the exclusive jurisdiction of other 
regulatory agencies, such as the IAC-Tobacco under Republic Act No. 
9211. It notes that Congress had decided not to give Republic Act No. 
9711 application "in a suppletory manner to other special laws"
[69]
 as seen in how this clause was omitted in the final version.
[70]

 It adds that the Implementing Rules unduly encroach on the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the IAC-Tobacco over the labeling,  advertising, 
sponsorship, and marketing of tobacco products.
[71]
 

 Respondent adds that Book II, Article III, Section 2(b), paragraph 2 of
 the Implementing Rules lacks basis and runs counter to constitutional 
and statutory provisions. It notes that the WHO FCTC is allegedly not 
self-implementing, which means that petitioners cannot use it as "basis 
of any right or obligation";
[72]
 and that the restriction provided in the Implementing Rules violates respondent's right to equal protection.
[73]


 Respondent-intervenor supports respondent in that tobacco 
products are not "health products" under Section 10(ff) of Republic Act 
No. 3720.
[74]
 He claims that 
the provision's second sentence, which states that health products are 
those that have an effect on health, must be construed as "akin in 
nature to those enumerated in the first sentence in application of the 
doctrine of 
ejusdem generis
."
[75]
 Tobacco products, he argues, are not included in the list
[76]

 or germane to such classâunlike the health products enumerated which 
"have generally beneficial use, albeit, with potential harm[,]"
[77]
 tobacco products have no health benefits.
  
 Respondent-intervenor adds that Republic Act No. 9211 
effectively amended the Department of Health's general powers on health 
matters under the Administrative Code.
[78]

 He opposes the inclusion of tobacco products and the tobacco industry 
in the Implementing Rules pursuant to DOH Memorandum No. 2010-0126, 
Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2010-01, and the WHO FCTC, claiming that 
petitioners "were tasked to implement solely the provisions of [Republic
 Act No. 9711], not any administrative fiat or international covenant 
which could stand on their own."
[79]
 He adds that the WHO FCTC is "addressed principally to the State Parties' legislature, not to mere administrative bodies."
[80]


 Respondent-intervenor contends that having "[d]ual 
jurisdiction will definitely spawn conflicts and confusion which may be 
inimical to the government's health agenda on tobacco products."
[81]

 With the Department of Health's vast functions in protecting the 
people's health, it would allegedly "be best for a specialized agency 
like the IAC-Tobacco to focus on a particular[ly] deleterious product 
[which is] tobacco."
[82]
 He 
points out that ascertaining the correctness of the legislature's wisdom
 behind excluding tobacco products and the tobacco industry from the 
coverage of Republic Act No. 9711 is beyond the authority of any court 
or administrative body to correct or defy.
[83]


 Respondent-intervenor further argues that the Food and Drug 
Administration's assumption of jurisdiction over tobacco products will 
yield absurd results. It would allegedly be incredible to ensure the 
"safety, efficacy, purity and quality"
[84]

 of tobacco products, the latter being hazardous. He adds that, although
 regulated, tobacco products remain to be "legitimate articles of 
commerce"
[85]
 which cannot be banned for failing to conform to standards imposed by the Food and Drug Administration.
[86]
 

 For this Court's resolution is the main issue of whether or not the 
Regional Trial Court correctly nullified the Rules and Regulations 
Implementing Republic Act No. 9711 insofar as it included tobacco 
products and the tobacco industry in its coverage. 
 Subsumed under this are two issues: 

 First, whether or not Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711 excludes the 
regulation of the health aspects of tobacco products from the Food and 
Drug Administration's authority; and
 Second, whether or not 
tobacco products are "health products" under the definition provided 
under Section 10(ff) of Republic Act No. 3720, as amended by Section 9 
of Republic Act No. 9711. 
 The Petition is granted. 
 
 I 
 

 Before delving into the issues, a brief overview of the government's 
tobacco control measures to reduce tobacco use in our country is 
apropos. 
 It is the State policy to "protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them."
[87]

 The Department of Health, as the government agency that chiefly 
responds to health concerns, is "primarily responsible for the 
formulation, planning, implementation, and coordination of policies and 
programs in the field of health."
[88]
 Specifically,  its powers and functions are:
  


 SECTION 3. Powers and Functions. â The Department shall:






(1)


Define the national health policy and formulate and implement a national health plan 
within
 the framework of the government's general policies and plans, and 
present proposals to appropriate authorities on national issues which 
have health implications;






 


 






(2)


Provide for health programs, services, 
facilities and other requirements as may be needed, subject to 
availability of funds and administrative rules and regulations;






 


 






(3)


Coordinate or collaborate with, and 
assist local communities, agencies and interested groups including 
international organizations in activities related to health; 






 


 






(4)


Administer all laws, rules and regulations in the field of health
, including quarantine laws and food and drug safety laws;






 


 






(5)


Collect, analyze and disseminate 
statistical and other relevant information on the country's health 
situation, and require the reporting of such information from 
appropriate sources; 






 


 






(6)


Propagate health information and 
educate the population on important health, medical and environmental 
matters which have health implications
; 






 


 






(7)


Undertake health and medical research and conduct training in support of its priorities, programs and activities;






 


 






(8)


Regulate the operation of and issue 
licenses and permits to government and private hospitals, clinics and 
dispensaries, laboratories, blood banks, drugstores and such other 
establishments which by the nature of their functions are required to be
 regulated by the Department;






 


 






(9)


Issue orders and regulations concerning the implementation of established health policies
; and














(10)

[89]
 (Emphasis supplied) 








As the national technical authority on health, the Department of 
Health serves as the key government agency for promoting tobacco control
 in the country.	In 1987, the then Non-Communicable Disease Control	 
Service,
[90]
 under the 
Department's Public Health Services, developed a five-year national 
smoking control plan as its primary strategy in the lung cancer 
prevention program.	The plan aimed to reduce the national prevalence of 
smoking by 10% in 1997, render all the department facilities smoke-free 
by  1993, and ban smoking among elementary and high school students.
[91]

 To increase public awareness against smoking, it launched its 
anti-smoking campaign in the 1990s, through its "Yosi Kadiri" iconic 
mascot and media campaigns, to illustrate the detrimental effects of 
cigarette smoking on the health of both smokers and non-smokers.
[92]


 In 1992, Republic Act No. 7934 or the Consumer Act of the 
Philippines was passed, aiming to protect consumer interest and promote 
general welfare
[93]
 through the following measures:    
  






a)


protection against hazards to health and safety;






b)


protection against deceptive, unfair and unconscionable acts and practices;






c)


provision of information and education to facilitate sound choice and the proper exercise of rights by the consumer;






d)


provision of adequate rights and means of redress; and






e)


involvement of consumer representatives in the formulation of social and economic policies.
[94]
 








The Department of Health is the implementing agency tasked to 
establish and enforce consumer product quality and safety standards,
[95]
 compulsory labeling and fair packaging,
[96]
 and advertising and sales promotion restrictions
[97]
 relative to food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, and hazardous substances.
[98]
 It may also require that labels of packaging indicate the following: 








a)


 whether it is flammable or inflammable;






b)


 directions for use, if necessary;






c)


warning of toxicity;






d)


wattage, voltage or amperes; or






e)


process of manufacture used if necessary.
[99]
 








 In relation to tobacco's health hazards, the law required that all
 cigarette packs carry a health warning: "Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous
 to Your Health."
[100]
 The Department of Health likewise enforced labeling and packaging requirements,
[101]

 issuing Administrative Order No. 10 in 1993. It provided that no 
cigarette without the warning statement would be allowed in the market 
beginning January 1, 1994, and would be seized by food and drug 
regulation officers. 


 That same year, the Department of Health issued Administrative 
Order No. 8, prohibiting smoking in all its offices, agencies, 
hospitals, and premises nationwide. A 100% smoke-free policy was later 
established for all government agencies, local government units, and 
state universities,
[102]
 as well as in public utility vehicles and land transportation terminals.
[103]
 

 In 1999, Republic Act No. 8749 or the Philippine Clean Air Act also 
prohibited under Article 5, Section 24 smoking in public buildings or 
enclosed public places, including public vehicles and other means of 
transport. It also banned smoking in any enclosed area outside one's 
private residence, private place of work, or any duly designated smoking
 area. 
 To further curtail the increasing tobacco consumption and
 its negative effects on health and the economy, Republic Act No. 9211 
or the Tobacco Regulation Act was enacted on June 23, 2003. It regulated
 the use, sale, and advertisement of tobacco products while promoting 
healthy environments and mandating health programs and withdrawal 
clinics.
[104]
 Smoking in public places like hospitals, clinics, and enclosed public places are banned.
[105]
 All forms of mass media advertising were banned by July 1, 2008,
[106]
 including the sponsorship of cultural and sporting events by the tobacco industry.
[107]
 

 The law adds that, by 2004, cigarettes advertisements and packs must 
bear a warning on specific health hazards caused by smoking. Warnings 
should include, on a rotating basis, separately or simultaneously, 
messages such as, "Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health," 
"Cigarettes are Addictive," "Tobacco Smoke can Harm Your Children," or 
"Smoking Kills,"
[108]
 amending Article 94 of the Consumer Act.
[109]

 The law also requires that all tobacco packages contain either of the 
messages "NO SALE TO MINORS" or "NOT FOR SALE TO MINORS" on one panel.
[110]

 The law expressly repealed DOH Administrative Order No. 10, as well as 
Administrative Order No. 24, series of 2003, which had also provided 
guidelines on cigarette labeling and advertisements.
[111]


 Under Section 29, the law also created the IAC-Tobacco, which 
was vested with the exclusive power and function to administer and 
implement the provisions of the law. Accordingly, the IAC-Tobacco issued
 Memorandum Circular No. 1, series of 2004, or the Implementing Rules 
and Regulations of the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003.
[112]

 As with the Tobacco Regulation Act, these Implementing Rules and 
Regulations cover a range of topics on tobacco controlâproviding 
definitions and standards for designated smoking areas, access 
restrictions, and restrictions on advertising, promotions, and 
sponsorships, among others. 
  
 Shortly after, on September 23, 2003, the Philippines became a
 signatory to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on 
Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), which was ratified on June 6, 2005.
[113]

 The WHO FCTC embodies the WHO's tobacco-free initiative, recognizing 
that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is a	
basic constitutional right.
[114]
 
 Being a party to the WHO FCTC, the Philippines committed to implement tobacco control measures such as price and tax policies.
[115]

 It also committed to "adopt and implement effective legislative, 
executive and administrative or other measures" to reduce tobacco demand
 and consumption, including: 
  
 	protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor 
workplaces, public transport, indoor public places, and other public 
places;
[116]
 


	regulation of tobacco products' contents, emissions,
[117]
 and disclosures;
[118]
 


	packaging and labelling regulations;
[119]
 


	education and public awareness measures;
[120]
 


	comprehensive ban/restrictions on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship;
[121]


measures to combat illicit trade;
[122]
 


prohibition of sale by, and to, minors;
[123]
 


	measures to promote cessation of tobacco use and adequate treatment for tobacco dependence;
[124]
 and 


 reduction of tobacco industry interference in setting and implementing public health policies.
[125]
 


 The treaty also provides for international cooperation to support 
tobacco control, including scientific, technical, and legal cooperation 
and information sharing.
[126]
 Finally, each state party is required to submit periodic reports on its implementation of the Convention.
[127]
 

 In accordance with the WHO FCTC, the Department of Health 
institutionalized the National Tobacco Prevention and Control Program, 
which would focus on five priority areas: (1) tobacco dependence and 
cessation; (2) protection from exposure to tobacco smoke; (3) education,
 communication, and training; (4) regulation of tobacco product 
disclosure; and (5) regulation of tobacco products' contents.
[128]
 
 In line with Articles 7 and 11 of the WHO FCTC, the Department of Health issued Administrative Order No. 2010-0013
[129]

 on May 25, 2010, requiring graphic health information on tobacco 
product packages and prohibiting the promotion of any tobacco product 
using misleading descriptors. Also, aligned with the WHO FCTC, the Civil
 Service Commission and the Department of Health issued Joint Memorandum
 Circular No. 2010-01,
[130]
 
which provides guidelines for interactions with the tobacco industry 
under the policy protecting the bureaucracy against tobacco industry 
interference. The Department of Health further issued Memorandum No. 
2010-0126,
[131]
 with the same purpose but specific to protecting the Department against tobacco industry interference.

 In 2011, the Department of Health, through the Food and Drug 
Administration, issued the Rules and Regulations Implementing Republic 
Act No. 9711 (Implementing Rules), incorporating provisions on tobacco 
product regulation and protection against tobacco industry interference.
 
 As to price and tax measures, Republic Act No. 10351 or the Sin
 Tax Law was signed into law in 2012. In considerably increasing the 
specific excise tax on tobacco and tobacco products, the law raised the 
consumer price of cigarettes, discouraging consumption. The law also 
provided funds for the Universal Health Care Law.
[132]

 On July 15, 2014, Republic Act No. 10643 or the Graphic Health Warnings
 Law was enacted, recognizing the Philippines' obligation under the WHO 
FCTC "to inform every person of the health consequences of tobacco 
consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke; to enact effective measures 
to curb and reduce tobacco use, especially among the youth; and to 
protect public health policy from the commercial and vested interests of
 the tobacco industry."
[133]
 
The law also acknowledged the Philippines' duty under Article 11 of the 
WHO FCTC to adopt and implement effective health warnings on tobacco 
products.
[134]
 It expressly 
repealed Section 13 of Republic Act No. 9211 on cigarette package 
warnings, and DOH Administrative Order No. 2010-0013. Republic Act No. 
10643 is implemented by administrative orders
[135]
 issued by the Department of Health which establish the templates of the required graphic health warnings.

 This narrative clearly establishes that the Department of Health has 
been at the forefront of policymaking and implementation on matters 
affecting public health, including tobacco control programs. 
 
 II 
 

 This case involves the validity of the Implementing Rules of Republic 
Act No. 9711, insofar as it included the health aspects of tobacco 
products in the regulatory authority of the Department of Health through
 the Food and Drug Administration under Book II, Article III. 
 
Respondent primarily argues that the inclusion of tobacco products 
disregards Republic Act No. 9211, which vested in the IAC-Tobacco 
exclusive power to regulate tobacco products, and Section 25 of Republic
 Act No. 9711, which excludes tobacco products from the Food and Drug 
Administration's jurisdiction.
[136]

 Ruling for respondent, the Regional Trial Court held that petitioners 
erred in including tobacco products under Book II, Article III of the 
Implementing Rules.
[137]
 
 The Regional Trial Court is incorrect. 
 

     II (A) 
  
 
 
 The enactment of Republic Act No. 9711, 
geared toward strengthening the State's regulatory capacity and 
enforcement of compliance with regulations over health products,
[138]
 finds support in the Constitution. 
 Article II, Section 15 states: 
  


 SECTION 15. The State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. 




 Meanwhile, under Section 12 of Article XIII, on social justice and human rights, states: 
  


 SECTION 12. The State shall establish and maintain an effective 
food and drug regulatory system and undertake appropriate health 
manpower development and research, responsive to the country's health 
needs and problems. 




 Republic Act No. 9711 created the Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked to carry out its provisions.
[139]
 Aligned with the constitutional declarations, Republic Act No. 9711 aims: 
  






a)


To enhance and strengthen 
the administrative and technical capacity of the FDA in the regulation 
of establishments and products under its jurisdiction; 






 


 






b)


 
To ensure the FDA's monitoring and regulatory coverage over establishments and products under its jurisdiction; and






 


 






c)


To provide coherence in the FDA's regulatory system for establishments and products under its jurisdiction.
[140]
 








Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9711, which amends Republic Act No. 
3270, explicitly provides the specific functions and duties of the Food 
and Drug Administration:
  


 (a)	
To administer the effective implementation of this Act and of the rules and regulations issued pursuant to the same; 


 (b)	
To assume primary jurisdiction in the collection of samples of health products; 


 (c)	
To analyze and inspect health products in connection with the implementation of this Act
; 


 (d)	
To establish analytical data to serve as basis for the 
preparation of health products standards, and to recommend standards of 
identity, purity, safety, efficacy, quality and fill of container;
 


 (e)	
To issue certificates of compliance with technical 
requirements to serve as basis for the issuance of appropriate 
authorization and spotÂ­ check for compliance with regulations regarding 
operation of manufacturers, importers, exporters, distributors, 
wholesalers, drug outlets, and other establishments and facilities of 
health products, as determined by the FDA
; 


 (f)	To levy, assess and collect fees for inspection, analysis 
and testing of products and materials submitted in compliance with the 
provisions of this Act. 


 (g)	To certify batches of anti-biotic and anti-biotic preparations in compliance with the provisions of this Act. 


 (h)	
To conduct appropriate tests on all applicable health 
products prior to the issuance of appropriate authorizations to ensure 
safety, efficacy, purity, and quality
; 


 (i)	
To require all manufacturers, traders, distributors, 
importers, exporters, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, and 
non-consumer users of health products to report to the FDA any incident 
that reasonably indicates that said product has caused or contributed to
 the death, serious illness or serious injury to a consumer, a patient, 
or any person; 


 (j) 
To issue cease and desist orders motu proprio or upon 
verified complaint for health products, whether or not registered with 
the FDA: Provided
, that for registered 
health products
, the
 cease and desist order is valid for thirty (30) days and may be 
extended for sixty (60) days only after due process has been observed; 


 (k)	
After due process, to order the ban, recall, and/or 
withdrawal of any health product found to have caused the death, serious
 illness or serious injury to a consumer or patient, or is found to be 
imminently injurious, unsafe, dangerous, or grossly deceptive, and to 
require all concerned to implement the risk management plan which is a 
requirement for the issuance of the appropriate authorization; 


 (l)	
To strengthen the post market surveillance system in 
monitoring health products as defined in this Act and incidents of 
adverse events involving such products;
 


 (m) 
To develop and issue standards and appropriate authorizations that would cover establishments, facilities and health products;
 


 (n)	
To conduct, supervise, monitor and audit research studies
 on	 health and safety issues of health products undertaken by entities 
duly approved by the FDA;
 


 (o)	To prescribe standards, guidelines, and regulations with 
respect to information, advertisements and other marketing instruments 
and promotion, sponsorship, and other marketing activities about the 
health products as covered in this Act; 


 (p)	To maintain bonded warehouses/ and/or establish the same, 
whenever necessary or appropriate, as determined by the director-general
 for confiscated goods in strategic areas of the country especially at 
major ports of entry; and


 (q)	To exercise such other powers and perform such other 
functions as may be necessary to carry out its duties and 
responsibilities under this Act.
[141]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 At the core of the present controversy is Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711, which reads: 
  


 SECTION 25. 
Coverage
. â This Act shall govern all health products: 
Provided,
 That nothing in this Act shall be deemed to modify the sole and 
exclusive jurisdiction of other specialized agencies and special laws 
only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws,
 including, but not limited to, those covered by Republic Act No. 9211
, Executive Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468. (Emphasis supplied) 




 Petitioners argue for including tobacco products in the 
Implementing Rules, these being health products due to their hazardous 
effects on health.
[142]
 
Petitioners contend that under Section 25, the Food and Drug 
Administration "retains jurisdiction over health products (including 
tobacco products) on matters delving on the protection of public 
healthâthe same not being within the jurisdiction of other specialized 
agencies."
[143]
 
 
Respondent counters that Republic Act No. 9211 encompasses the 
regulation of health matters concerning tobacco products and tobacco 
use.
[144]
 While Section 25 
acknowledges the Food and Drug Administration's authority over health 
products, it explicitly excluded products and industries governed by 
other laws.
[145]
 Says 
respondent, the Food and Drug Administration "has no jurisdiction over 
tobacco products and the tobacco industry, which are under the sole and 
exclusive jurisdiction of the IAC-T[obacco], as provided under [Republic
 Act No. 9211]."
[146]
 
 We rule for petitioners. 

 The mere acknowledgment in Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711 that 
nothing in that law "shall be deemed to modify the sole and exclusive 
jurisdiction of other specialized agencies[,]" such as the IAC-Tobacco 
under Republic Act No. 9211, does not automatically place tobacco 
products  outside the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory 
authority. Quite the contrary, the IAC-Tobacco's authority under 
Republic Act No. 9211 does not cover the regulation of the health 
aspects of tobacco products. 
 Recognizing the need to protect the
 people from hazardous products and, simultaneously, to protect the 
interest of various stakeholders and workers in the tobacco industry, 
Republic Act No. 9211 was enacted to further the government's "balanced 
policy" in regulating the use, sale, and advertisement of tobacco 
products: 
  


 Section 2. 
Policy
. â It is the policy of the State to 
protect the populace from hazardous products and promote the right to 
health and instill health consciousness among them. It is also the 
policy of the State, consistent with the Constitutional ideal to promote
 the general welfare, to safeguard the interests of the workers and 
other stakeholders in the tobacco industry. 
For these purposes, the government shall institute a balanced policy whereby the 
use, sale and advertisements of tobacco products shall be regulated

 in order to promote a healthful environment and protect the citizens 
from the hazards of tobacco smoke, and at the same time ensure that the 
interests of tobacco farmers, growers, workers and stakeholders are not 
adversely compromised
. (Emphasis supplied) 




 Hence, Republic Act No. 9211 holds the following objectives: 
  
 	Promote a 
healthful environment
;
Inform
 the public of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking and tobacco use;
 Regulate and subsequently ban all 
tobacco advertisements and sponsorships
; 
 Regulate the 
labeling
 of tobacco products;
	Protect the youth from being initiated to cigarette smoking and tobacco use by 
prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors
;
 Assist and encourage Filipino 
tobacco farmers
 to cultivate alternative agricultural crops to prevent economic dislocation; and 
 Create an 
Inter-Agency Committee on Tobacco (IAC-Tobacco)
 to oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Act. (Emphasis supplied) 


 Republic Act No. 9211 created the IAC-Tobacco,
[147]
 which "shall have the 
exclusive
 power and function to administer and implement" the law:
  


 Section 29. Implementing Agency. â An Inter-Agency Committee â Tobacco (IAC-Tobacco), which shall have the 
exclusive power and/unction to administer and implement the provisions of this Act,

 is hereby created. The IAC-Tobacco shall be chaired by the Secretary of
 the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) with the Secretary of the 
Department of Health (DOH) as Vice Chairperson. The IAC-Tobacco shall 
have the following as members: 


	Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA);
 Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ); 
 Secretary of the Department of Finance (DOF);
 Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR); 
Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST); 
Secretary of the Department of Education (DepEd); 
 Administrator of the National Tobacco Administration (NTA);
 A representative from the Tobacco Industry to be nominated by the legitimate and recognized associations of the industry; and
A representative from a nongovernment organization (NGO) 
involved in public health promotion nominated by DOH in consultation 
with the concerned NGOs; 




 The Department Secretaries may designate their Undersecretaries as their authorized representatives to the IAC.
[148]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 Accordingly, the IAC-Tobacco's implementing authority is limited to the acts under Republic Act No. 9211, which include: 
  




I.


Healthful Environment








 


 








1)

III.


Advertising and Promotion






 


 


 






 


1)


Required printed warnings on cigarette packaging;
[156]






 


2)


Required warnings in all forms of tobacco advertising;
[157]

 Subsequent ban on tobacco advertisements
[162]
 and sponsorships;
[163]






 


5)


Limitations on Naming Rights
[164]






The law also mandates the IAC-Tobacco to monitor compliance with Republic Act No. 9211.
[165]
 Section 33 further specifies the IAC-Tobacco's involvement in relevant programs under the law:




 SECTION 33. Programs and Projects. â For a period not exceeding 
five (5) years, the National Government and the concerned departments 
and agencies shall provide the following programs and projects: 


Tobacco Growers' Assistance Program
 â This program 
shall be utilized to support financially the tobacco farmers who may be 
displaced due to the implementation of this Act or has voluntarily 
ceased to produce tobacco. . . .

        . . . .
      
Tobacco Growers' Cooperative
. â This program shall 
promote cooperative programs to assist tobacco farmers in developing 
alternative farming systems, plant alternative crops and other 
livelihood projects . . . 
National Smoking Cessation Program
. â 
A National Smoking Cessation Program shall be undertaken with the approval of the IAC-Tobacco
.
 The implementing rules and guidelines to reinforce this program shall 
be submitted to the IAC-Tobacco by the Secretary of Health within three 
(3) months after the effectivity of this Act. 
Research and Development Program
. â 
The IAC-Tobacco 
shall establish a research and development program to be spearheaded by 
the NTA in cooperation with the DOST, which will undertake studies 
concerning technologies and methods to reduce the risk of dependence and
 injury from tobacco product usage and exposure, alternative uses of 
tobacco and similar research programs
. 
National Tobacco-Free Public Education Program
. â State
 Universities and Colleges and Technical and Vocational Schools shall 
provide scholarship programs for dependents of tobacco growers for which
 the administrator of the NTA shall provide implementing rules and 
guidelines. 
The guidelines shall be submitted to the IAC-Tobacco within three (3) months after the effectivity of this Act.
Displaced Cigarette Factory Workers' Assistance Program
. â 
The
 Secretary of Labor and Employment, with the concurrence of the 
IAC-Tobacco shall establish a program to assist displaced, 
terminated/separated or retrenched cigarette factory workers as a result
 of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Labor in coordination 
with the NTA and DTI shall provide the rules and guidelines to 
effectuate this program and submit the same to the IAC-Tobacco within 
three (3) months after the effectivity of this Act.
Health Programs
. â 
 The IAC-Tobacco, in consultation
 with the DOH, shall be responsible for awarding grants to all medical 
institutions for the purpose of planning, carrying out, and evaluating 
activities related to smoking-related illnesses. The IAC-Tobacco shall 
submit to Congress and the President of the Philippines the annual 
report of expenditures related to this program
.
Withdrawal Clinics
. â The DOH shall establish smoking 
withdrawal clinics to provide counseling regarding the hazardous health 
effects of tobacco/cigarette smoking and to rehabilitate smokers from 
the hazardous effects of such products.




 If a smoker-minor voluntarily submits himself for treatment, 
counseling, or rehabilitation in a smoking withdrawal clinic located in 
any medical institution in the Philippines, or through his 
parent/guardian, the expenses incurred shall be a reimbursable 
outpatient service of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation. 
(Emphasis supplied)






 Meanwhile, Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711 clearly establishes that the law shall cover 
all
 health products, except for 
acts covered by special laws
. Hence, matters 
not covered

 by special laws remain under the Food and Drug Administration's broad 
regulatory authority. Exceptions are strictly construed and "extend only
 as far as their language fairly warrants[.]"
[166]

 Moreover, "particular clauses and phrases of a statute should not be 
taken as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part
 thereof must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts."
[167]
 Respondent cannot truncate Section 25 and only focus on a particular phrase to suit its desired interpretation. 
 It is evident from Republic Act No. 9211 that the IAC-Tobacco has 
limited 
jurisdiction
 over tobacco products and does not regulate all their aspects. Its 
implementing authority is only restricted to the acts provided under the
 law, which mainly include the regulation of distribution, access, sale,
 labeling, advertisements, sponsorships, and promotions of tobacco 
products.
[168]
 Nothing in the law denotes that it holds authority over the health aspects of tobacco products. 
 Conversely, under Republic Act No. 9711, the Food and Drug Administration has regulatory authority over all 
health products
,
 which include tobacco products. Under Section 25, the Food and Drug 
Administration retains its regulatory authority as to the health aspect 
of tobacco products, it being beyond IAC-Tobacco's implementing 
authority under Republic Act No. 9211. This interpretation is more in 
keeping with the oft-repeated rule on statutory construction that laws 
are interpreted not only to be consistent throughout its provisions, but
 also to be in harmony with other laws on a similar subject, to build a 
coherent system.
[169]
 
Accordingly, there is no merit in respondent-intervenor's claim that 
insofar as the health aspects of tobacco products are concerned, 
Republic Act No. 9211 diminished the Department of Health's general 
authority on health concerns under the Administrative Code.
[170]

 Section 34 of the law even recognized the Department of Health's 
capability on matters of health when it was designated to lead the 
information dissemination on the harmful effects of smoking:
 
Information Program




 SECTION 34. 
Information Drive. â Consistent with the 
provisions of this Act, the DOH shall, in cooperation with the DepEd and
 with the assistance of the Philippine Information Agency (PIA), 
undertake a continuous information program on the harmful effects of 
smoking
.


 The DOH shall enlist the active participation of the public and 
private sectors in the national effort to discourage the unhealthy habit
 of smoking.


 SECTION 35. 
Instruction on the Hazardous Effect of Smoking as Part of School Curricula
.
 â Instruction on the adverse effects of cigarette/tobacco smoking, 
including their health, environmental and economic implications, shall 
be integrated into the existing curricula of all public and private 
elementary and high schools. 


 The DepEd Secretary shall promulgate such rules and regulations 
as may be necessary to carry out the above stated policy hereof, and, 
with the assistance of the Secretary of Health, and with the approval of
 the IACÂ­ Tobacco, shall cause the publication and distribution of 
materials on the unhealthy effects of smoking to students and the 
general public. (Emphasis supplied) 




 
 II (B) 
 
 
 Besides, 
tobacco products are undeniably "health products" based on the 
definition provided in Section 10(ff) of Republic Act No. 3720, as 
amended by Section 9 of Republic Act No. 9711, which reads: 
  


 (ff) 'Health products' means food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, 
biologicals, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and household/urban 
hazardous substances and/or a combination of and/or a derivative 
thereof. 
It shall also refer to products that may have an effect on health which require regulations as determined by the FDA
. (Emphasis supplied) 




 This definition is clear "that there is no room for construction or interpretation, but only application."
[171]

 Section 10(ff) comprises two parts. The first part refers to an 
enumeration of specific products considered as health products. The 
second part is a general statement that health products "
shall also refer to products that may have an 
effect
 on health which require regulations as determined by the FDA.
"
[172]


 Tobacco use, as well as exposure to secondhand smoking, pose health hazards that cause death and disease among people.
[173]

 Clearly, all products affecting healthâincluding tobacco productsâare 
within Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction. The second part of 
the definition in Section 10(ff) even gives the Food and Drug 
Administration discretionary authority to determine which products 
require regulation. 
  
 Respondent-intervenor's view that tobacco products are not "health products" by the 
ejusdem generis
 principle is flawed.
[174]
 The principle only applies in case of ambiguity, which is not the case here. Moreover, 
ejusdem generis

 would not control since restricting "health products" to the list 
provided under Section 10(ff) or to the same class would hinder the 
lawmaker's intent of strengthening the Food and Drug Administration's 
regulatory authority under Republic Act No. 9211.
[175]

 To sum, it would be misplaced to construe Section 25 of Republic Act 
No. 9711 as an express delineation which placed tobacco products beyond 
the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory authority. It is within 
the Food and Drug Administration's competence and mandate "to ensure 
safety, efficacy, purity, and quality"
[176]

 of health products which, based on the definition under the law, 
clearly includes tobacco products. A contrary reading, in that the Food 
and Drug Administration could regulate cosmetics due to its effects on 
health but not tobacco products, would be illogical.
 
 III 
 

 The inclusion of tobacco products in the coverage of the Implementing 
Rules is not only supported by the text of the law, but also by 
pertinent congressional deliberations. It likewise adheres to the 
Philippines' obligations under the WHO FCTC. 
 The Food and Drug 
Administration is an attached agency of the Department of Health. As 
such, the regulatory authority over the health aspect of tobacco 
products not only falls within its mandate, but more so within its 
competence and expertise. 
 This much is revealed in the 
deliberations of the Bicameral Conference Committee on Section 25 of 
Republic Act No. 9711. The legislative intent was that the health 
aspects of tobacco, sugar, and coconut are within the regulatory 
authority of Food and Drug Administration, consistent with the thrust of
 Republic Act No. 9211 to strengthen the regulatory, licensing, and 
monitoring powers of the Food and Drug Administration on health 
products. In this sense, it was made clear that Republic Act No. 9711 
applies suppletorily to the special laws, with regard to the health 
effects of these products. Pertinent portions of the deliberations cited
 by the petitioners-intervenors are insightful: 
  


 REP VALDEZ: Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Senator Legarda, 
for the honor of proposing these amendments.	This is actually, Your  
Honor, a follow-up of the proceedings during the Bicameral Conference 
that we had on February 23 where the Honorable Senator Legarda sought to
 clearly exclude from the coverage of the proposed law those that are 
already covered by special laws particularly sugar, tobacco and coconut .
 . . that the powers, Your Honor please, of the FDA shall not include 
those that are already covered . . . .


 . . . .


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.): 
But just to clarify. This does not in any way extend beyond the actual coverage of those special laws
.
 So, like I said, if the special law referred to the subsidy to coconut 
growers, that what we're saying that BFAD will not get involved there, 
'no. But 
with respect to the health aspect, to the extent that BFAD monitors all health products, then BFAD will still be involved
.


 REP. VALDEZ: For as long as they are covered by the special law, Your Honor please, then it will be covered by the BFAD. 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.): For as long as that act is not covered by the special agency. 


 REP. VALDEZ: Yes, Your Honor. 


 . . . .


 REP LOCSIN: Madam Chair, 
may I ask, Your Honor, Senator 
Legarda, do any of these agencies - sugar, coconut, tobacco - have the 
capability to enhance FDA that we have envisioned to monitor the health 
effects of the products of each of these sectors? I think none of them 
do, none of them [have] the capabilities to monitor the health effects 
of any of these products that the new BFAD will have
. Unless there 
is actually a scientific component to RA . . . preventing BFAD, the new 
BFAD from making a declaration against tobacco if they feel the way 
surgeon general in the United States does. He probably has no authority 
to do it but nobody can stop him either and say, "Whatever the tobacco, 
coconut or sugar industry say, we say, 'Too much consumption of sugar is
 bad for your health."' I just don't want that to be . . .


 SEN. LEGARDA: 
My only concern is, there should not be any 
duplication of laws so that there's no confusion. But to prevent the new
 BFAD from becoming strong in its implementation, I think, would defeat 
the purpose of this law. So [,] I support you in a sense that we should,
 of course, strengthen the power of BFAD
. But my concern in not 
including all these three commodities is the duplication and the 
confusion of the sectors concerned whether these are big industries 
coconut, tobacco . . .


 REP. LOCSIN: I can see that. But, Madam Chair, perhaps in the body of the proposed legislation, 
we
 can emphasize that the new BFAD will have the power to investigate the 
health effects of any product in Philippine agriculture
. 


 SEN. LEGARDA: I think, if I may add, the strength of this new 
law, Congressman Locsin, should also be founded in its capability. It 
will be allowed to coordinate, to cooperate with already existing 
specialized agencies in the exercise of its functions because it's not 
only the health that is concerned, it's the economic aspect, the way it 
affects agriculture and all the farmers down the drain. So I don't think
 we will â what's the word, emasculate the new law or destrengthen or 
soften the â weaken the powers of BFAD. We simply did not want to 
confuse all the various sectors in the . . . 


 REP. LOCSIN: So when it comes to health, Madam Chair, BFAD's power is all encompassing and can reach into these areas? 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.): In fact[,] I was thinking 
in Section 26, just to clarify this further. In the very last sentence, 
it says, "This Act shall be applied in suppletory character." The 
intention of that was to say that the BFAD, the new FDA law and BFAD's 
previous function continues to exist but really what we really need to 
be sure is not misinterpreted is that BFAD, the new FDA is the authority
 as far as health concerned. So I was thinking and you did make a very 
simple statement that, I guess something like, with respect to the 
health aspect, the FDA shall continue to exercise its mandate. Something
 like that so that there is no confusion. I think the records will bear 
out all that â do you hear me? Okay. 


 REP LOCSIN: But, 
Madam Chair, I'm arguing for double 
jurisdiction in the sense that unless it is clear that the tobacco 
authority has the capability to monitor health consequences of the 
products they regulate, then BFAD should have supervening authority to 
interfere
[.]


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.): I agree because the 
confusion may arise that these special laws somehow cover the health 
aspect when it is really not their expertise even if they claim that 
they have some kind of say in it. 
So, I tend to agree with 
Congressman Locsin that it should be very clear that this law, the FDA 
bill will be now in-charge of the health aspect. And in that sense, it's
 suppletory to whatever the mandate the special laws have on those 
products but the health aspects is an FDA affair
.
[177]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 While not controlling, these deliberations are persuasive and 
support our interpretation of Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9711. 

 To emphasize, the IAC-Tobacco does not have sole and exclusive 
jurisdiction over tobacco products and the tobacco industry, but only 
over the implementation of Republic Act No. 9211. As to the health 
aspect of tobacco products, petitioners have the regulatory authority 
under Republic Act No. 9711. Therefore, they did not exceed their 
authority in promulgating the Implementing Rules in regulating tobacco 
products. 
 Parenthetically, the promulgation and enforcement of 
the Implementing Rules on the regulation of tobacco products follows the
 mandate of Article XIII, Section 12
[178]
 of the Constitution to establish and maintain an effective regulating body and system to protect public health. 

 Moreover, the contested provisions in the Implementing Rules are 
aligned with our international commitment under the WHO FCTC which 
"address[es] the 
health
, social, environmental and economic 
consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke
 worldwide."
[179]
 Salient provisions of the WHO FCTC read: 
 
 Article 3 

  Objective 
  
 




 The objective of this Convention and its protocols is to protect
 present and future generations from the devastating health, social, 
environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and 
exposure to tobacco smoke by providing a framework for tobacco control 
measures to be implemented by the Parties at the national, regional and 
international levels in order to reduce continually and substantially 
the prevalence of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke. 


 . . . .




 
 
Article 5 

  General Obligations










1.


Each Party shall develop, 
implement, periodically update and review comprehensive multisectoral 
national tobacco control strategies, plans and programmes in accordance 
with this Convention and the protocols to which it is a Party.






 


 






2.


Towards this end, each Party shall, in accordance with its capabilities: 






 


 


 








(a)


establish or reinforce and finance a national coordinating mechanism or focal points for tobacco control; and






 


 


 








(b)


adopt and implement 
effective legislative, executive, administrative and /or other measures 
and cooperate, as appropriate, with other Parties in developing 
appropriate policies for preventing and reducing tobacco consumption, 
nicotine addiction and exposure to tobacco smoke
.






 


 






3.


In setting and 
implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco 
control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and
 other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with 
national law.






 


 






4.


The Parties shall cooperate
 in the formulation of proposed measures, procedures and guidelines for 
the implementation of the Convention and the protocols to which they are
 parties.






 


 






5.


The Parties shall 
cooperate, as appropriate, with competent international and regional 
intergovernmental organizations and other bodies to achieve the 
objectives of the Convention and the protocols to which they are 
Parties. 






 


 






6.


The Parties shall, within 
means and resources at their disposal, cooperate to raise financial 
resources for effective implementation of the Convention through 
bilateral and multilateral funding mechanisms.
[180]
 (Emphasis supplied) 








Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC requires state parties to protect their
 tobacco control policymaking from tobacco industry interference. The 
WHO FCTC Guidelines reiterate this: 




 The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that efforts to 
protect tobacco control from commercial and other vested interests of 
the tobacco industry are comprehensive and effective. 
Parties should 
implement measures in all branches of government that may have an 
interest in, or the capacity to, affect public health policies with 
respect to tobacco control.
 


 The aim of these guidelines is to assist parties in meeting 
their legal obligations under Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC. The 
guidelines draw on the best available scientific evidence and the 
experience of Parties in addressing tobacco industry interference. 


 . . . .


 The guidelines are applicable to government officials, 
representatives and employees of any national, state, provincial, 
municipal, local or other public or semi/quasi-public institution or 
body within the jurisdiction of a Party, and to any person acting on 
their behalf. 
Any government branch (executive, legislative and 
judiciary) responsible for setting and implementing tobacco control 
policies and for protecting those policies against tobacco industry 
interests should be accountable
.
[181]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Moreover, the WHO FCTC stipulates price and tax measures
[182]
 and non-price measures to be implemented by state parties to reduce the demand for tobacco, including:    
  






i.


Testing, measuring and regulation of the contents and emissions of tobacco products;
[183]
 






 


 






ii.


Regulation of tobacco product 
disclosures to governmental authorities and to the public of information
 about the toxic constituents of the tobacco products and the emissions 
that they may produce;
[184]






 


 






iii.


Packaging and-labeling of tobacco products, including; 






 


 








 
(1) Information on constituents and emissions on outside packaging and labeling;
[185]
 






 


 








(2) Ban on packaging or labeling means 
that are false, misleading, deceptive or likely to create an erroneous 
impression about the product's characteristics, health effects, hazards 
or emissions, including any term, descriptor, trademark, figurative or 
other sign that directly or indirectly creates the false impression that
 a particular tobacco product is less harmful than others;
[186]
 or






 


 






iv.


Ban on all forms of tobacco 
advertising, promotions and sponsorship by any means that are false, 
misleading or deceptive or likely to create an erroneous impression 
about the tobacco product's characteristics, health effects, hazards or 
emissions.
[187]
 








The Philippines' entry into the WHO FCTC represents its commitment to "give priority to [its] right to protect public health";
[188]

 in particular, to implement the above-stated tobacco control measures 
to "reduce continually and substantially the prevalence of tobacco use 
and exposure to tobacco smoke."
[189]
 With the Senate's concurrence,
[190]
 the WHO FCTC became operative as part of national law in accordance with Section 21, Article VII
[191]
 of the Constitution.


 As explained in 
David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal
:
[192]




 The Senate's ratification of a treaty makes it legally effective
 and binding by transformation. It then has the force and effect of a 
statute enacted by Congress. In 
Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines v. Duque III, et al
.: 




 Under the 1987 Constitution, international law can become part
 of the sphere of domestic law either by transformation or 
incorporation. 
The transformation method requires that an 
international law be transformed into a domestic law through a 
constitutional mechanism such as local legislation
. The 
incorporation method applies when, by mere constitutional declaration, 
international law is deemed to have the force of domestic law.


 
Treaties become part of the law of the land through 
transformation pursuant to Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution 
which provides that "[n]o treaty or international agreement shall be 
valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all 
the members of the Senate." Thus, treaties or conventional international
 law must go through a process prescribed by the Constitution for it to 
be transformed into municipal law that can be applied to domestic 
conflicts
.




 Following ratification by the Senate, no further action, legislative or otherwise, is necessary.	
Thereafter;
 the whole of government â including the judiciary â is duty-bound to 
abide by the treaty, 
consistent with the maxim
 pacta sunt servanda
.
[193]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Accordingly, as national health authority, the Department of 
Health, along with the Food and Drug Administration, must consider the 
country's commitments under the WHO FCTC in exercising their regulatory 
powers over health products. 
 From the standpoint of Republic Act
 No. 9711, the Constitution, and the WHO FCTC, petitioners acted within 
their powers in including Book II, Article III (Tobacco Products) in the
 Implementing Rules. There is no overlap of functions, as it is clear 
that petitioners have technical authority over matters of public health.
 At any rate, the Implementing Rules explicitly state that the rules and
 regulations and other issuances to be promulgated by the Food and Drug 
Administration will refer to policy areas that are not covered by 
specialized agencies and special laws.
[194]


 Respondent, representing major transnational tobacco companies
 in this country, proposes an interpretation of our law that will 
effectively remove them from petitioners' regulation. Its desired 
interpretation allows for tobacco companies to be principally regulated 
by the IAC-Tobacco, of which they happen to also be members. This not 
only leads to an absurd result, but it is also contrary to law and our 
international obligations.

 SECTION 3. Other Products. â 
Nothing in the FDA Act of 2009

 including, but not limited to, those covered by Republic Act No. 9211, 
Executive Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree
 No. 1468.194 (Emphasis supplied) 
 


CONCURRING	OPINION




 PERLAS-BERNABE, 
J
.:


 I concur. 
 The crux of the present controversy is 
whether or not the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) issued by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to implement Republic Act No. 
(RA) 9711,
[1]
 otherwise known 
as the "Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009," went beyond the 
auspices of the statute it seeks to implement by according the FDA the 
authority to regulate tobacco products by classifying them as "health 
products." 
 To recount, the case began when respondent Philippine
 Tobacco Institute, Inc. (PTI) filed a petition for declaratory relief 
before the Regional Trial Court of Las Pinas City, Branch 255 (RTC) 
seeking to prohibit the enforcement of the FDA IRR on the ground that it
 unduly expands RA 9711, insofar as it classified tobacco products as 
"health products," and hence, unduly placed the same under the FDA's 
regulatory power.
[2]
 
 PTI contended that under RA 9211,
[3]

 otherwise known as the "Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003," it is the 
Inter-Agency Committee on Tobacco (IAC-Tobacco) which has exclusive 
jurisdiction over tobacco products, including its health aspects, and 
not the FDA. As basis, it cited Section 25
[4]
 of RA 9711 which specifically excluded tobacco products from the FDA's jurisdiction.
[5]
 

 In response, petitioners Department of Health (DOH) and FDA posited 
that the FDA retains jurisdiction and regulatory powers over the health 
aspects of certain products, such as tobacco. Meanwhile, the IAC-Tobacco
 only has authority to oversee the implementation of the provisions of 
RA 9211. As such, there is nothing repugnant with the FDA IRR insofar as
 it regulates tobacco products as "health products."
[6]
 
 The RTC ruled in favor of PTI, and hence, nullified the provisions of the FDA IRR (
i.e
.,
 Article III, Book II) insofar as it regulates tobacco products and the 
tobacco industry within the auspices of the FDA's jurisdiction.
[7]
 
 However, as correctly ruled by the 
ponencia
, the RTC's ruling must be reversed. 
 Under Section 10 (ff) of RA 3720,
[8]
 as amended
[9]

 by RA 9711, "health products" is defined as "food, drugs, cosmetics, 
devices, biologicals, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and 
household/urban hazardous substances and/or a combination of and/or a 
derivative thereof. 
It shall also refer to products that may have an effect on health which require regulations as determined by the FDA
."
 While tobacco products are not mentioned under the first paragraph of 
this section, these nevertheless fall under the second paragraph of the 
said provision, since tobacco products clearly affect the health of 
people. 
  
 On this score, it is worthy to point out that RA 9211 provides for the inclusion of warnings on cigarette packages, such as "
GOVERNMENT WARNING: Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health
;" "
GOVERNMENT WARNING: Cigarettes are Addictive
;" "
GOVERNMENT WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Can Harm Your Children
;" or "
GOVERNMENT WARNING: Smoking Kills
."
[10]
 Meanwhile, RA 10643,
[11]
 otherwise known as "The Graphic Health Warnings Law," added the requirement of 
placing graphic health warnings on the tobacco product package which accurately depicts the hazards of tobacco use
, accompanied by textual warning related to the picture.
[12]
 Palpably, these tobacco-specific laws recognize that tobacco products indeed "
have an effect on health
," which would necessarily make them fall under the definition of health products in RA 9711. 
  
 As earlier stated, PTI cited Section 25 of RA 9711, arguing 
that the same specifically excluded tobacco products from the 
jurisdiction of the FDA, because they are already put under the 
authority of other specialized agencies, 
i.e
., the IAC-Tobacco. Section 25 of RA 9711 reads: 
  


 Section 25. 
Coverage
. - This Act shall govern all health products: 
Provided
, 
That
 nothing in this Act shall be deemed to modify the sole and exclusive 
jurisdiction of other specialized agencies and special laws only insofar
 as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws, including, 
but not limited to, those covered by Republic Act No. 9211
 [or 
the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003
], Executive Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468. (emphasis supplied) 




 However, a study of the Congressional deliberations on RA 9711 would reveal that the 
legislature apparently intended to include tobacco as a health product, which is subject to regulation by the FDA at least 
insofar as its health aspect is concerned
. As stated during the deliberations, "
[t]he
 confusion may arise that these special laws somehow cover the health 
aspect when it is really not their expertise even if they claim that 
they have some kind of say in it
. x x x [I]t should be very clear that this law, 
the FDA bill[,] will be now in-charge of the health aspect
. And in that sense, 
[it is] suppletory to whatever mandate the special laws have on those products but the health aspects is an FDA affair

 REP. LOCSIN. Madam Chair, may I ask, Your Honor, Senator Legarda, 
do
 any of these agencies  â sugar, coconut, tobacco â have the capability 
to enhance FDA that we have envisioned to monitor the health effects of 
the products of these sectors
? I think none of them [does], none of 
them has the capabilities to monitor the health effects of any of these 
products that the new [Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD)] will have. 
Unless
 there is actually a scientific component to RA 9211, because I [do not]
 want this to be seen as preventing BFAD, the new BFAD[,] from making a 
declaration against tobacco
 if they feel the way the surgeon general in the United States does. x x x


 SEN. LEGARDA. My only concern is, there should not be any 
duplication of laws so that [there is] no confusion. But to prevent the 
new BFAD from becoming strong in its implementation, I think, would 
defeat the purpose of this law. So I support you in a sense that we 
should, of course, strengthen the power of BFAD. But my concern in not 
including all commodities is the duplication and the confusion of the 
sectors concerned whether these are big industries coconut, tobacco... 


 REP. LOCSIN. I can see that. But, Madam Chair, perhaps in the 
body of the proposed legislation, we can emphasize that the new BFAD 
will have the power to investigate the health effects of any product in 
Philippine agriculture. 


 SEN. LEGARDA. I think, if I may add, 
the strength of this new
 law, Congressman Locsin, should also be founded in its capability. It 
will be allowed to coordinate, to cooperate with already existing 
specialized agencies in the exercise of its functions because [it is] 
not only health that is concerned, [it is] the economic aspect
, the 
way it affects agriculture and all the farmers down the drain. So I [do 
not] think we will â [what is] the word, emasculate the new law or 
[de-strengthen] or soften the â weaken the powers of BFAD. We simply did
 not want to confuse all the various sectors in the implementation of 
the new law. 


 REP. LOCSIN. So when it comes to health, Madam Chair, BFAD's power is all encompassing and can reach into these areas? 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.). In fact, I was thinking in 
Section 26 just to clarify that further. In the very last sentence, it 
says, "This Act shall be applied in suppletory character." The intention
 of that was to say that the BFAD, the new FDA law and BFAD's previous 
function continues to exist but really what we really need to be sure is
 not misinterpreted, is that BFAD, 
the new FDA is the authority as far as health is concerned
. 


 So I was thinking and you did make a very simple statement that, I guess something like, 
with respect to the health aspect, the FDA shall continue to exercise its mandate
. Something like that so that there is no confusion. I think the records will bear out all that â do you hear me? Okay. 


 x x x x


 REP. LOCSIN. But, Madam Chair, [I am] arguing for double 
jurisdiction in the sense that unless it is clear that the tobacco 
authority has the capability to monitor the health consequences of the 
products they regulate, then BFAD should have supervening authority to 
interfere. 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.). 
I agree because the 
confusion may arise that these special laws somehow cover the health 
aspect when it is really not their expertise even if they claim that 
they have some kind of say in it.
 So, I tend to agree with Congressman Locsin that 
it should be very clear that this law, the FDA bill[,] will be now in-charge of the health aspect.
 And in that sense, 
[it is] suppletory to whatever mandate the special laws have on those products but the health aspects is an FDA affair
.
[14]
 ( emphases supplied) 




 Further, the Congressional deliberations would also show that 
despite the deletion of a previously proposed Section 26, which was 
meant to provide for the suppletory character of RA 9711 to the special 
laws governing products such as tobacco (RA 9211 and Executive Order 
[EO] No. 245), sugar (EO No. 18), and coconut (Presidential Decree No. 
1568), 
the legislature still intended RA 9711 to govern the health 
aspects of the products covered by these special laws through Section 25
 of RA 9711
, 
viz
.: 
  


 REP. LOCSIN. I think this Section 26 can be left as it is. 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.). Actually, [it is] not even necessary. 


 REP. LOCSIN. [That is] also true. 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.). [It is] [kind of] redundant. 


 REP. LAGMAN. Yeah, [it is] redundant altogether. We might as well remove it. That is not anymore a useful surplusage. 


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.). So we go to Section 25 
na lang
. 


 x x x x


 THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. CAYETANO, P.). x x x May I just raise concern, 
'no
. 
On Section 25 and 26, we just agreed to delete 26
.
 But the BFAD is just ensuring that our intention here is that they will
 continue to do the work they were doing with respect to health products
 because they wanted us to include the suppletory effect. But my 
understanding is that 
this provision exactly says what we want to say which is they will continue to govern health products
. x x x
[15]
 (emphases supplied)




 For these reasons, it appears that notwithstanding RA 9211 which 
created the IAC-Tobacco, Congress intended for tobacco products to be 
considered as health products, which limited aspect falls under the 
regulatory jurisdiction of the FDA. Verily, 
Section 25 of RA 9711
 â which essentially provides that the FDA shall have jurisdiction over health products except "
only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws
" â 
does not preclude the FDA's retention of regulatory powers over the health aspect of certain products, such as tobacco
.
 The reasonable harmonization therefore would be that, insofar as 
tobacco products are concerned, Section 25 maintains both the 
jurisdiction of the FDA and the IACÂ­ Tobacco. On the one hand, the FDA 
has regulatory jurisdiction 
only over the
 
health aspect
 of
 tobacco products, such as the determination of the amount of nicotine 
in tobacco products; on the other hand, the IAC-Tobacco has regulatory 
jurisdiction over 
all the other aspects
 of tobacco products, such
 as packaging, use, sale, distribution, and advertisements, which are 
the functions and processes provided for under RA 9211. To repeat, as 
stated in Section 29 of RA 9211, the IAC-Tobacco "shall have the 
exclusive power and function to administer and implement the provisions 
of this Act." RA 9211 is distinct and separable from the FDA Act (
i.e
., RA 9711) in that it does not directly regulate the health aspects of tobacco. 

 Based on the foregoing, it is therefore possible to reconcile RA 9211 
(which remains to be one of the special laws on tobacco and tobacco 
products) and RA 9711 (which is the general law on health products). 
Case law states that "
[t]he rule is that on a specific matter, the 
special law shall prevail over the general law, which shall be resorted 
to only to supply deficiencies in the former
. In addition, x x x 
[i]t is a canon of statutory construction that a later statute [(such as
 RA 9711 or the FDA Act)], general in its terms and not expressly 
repealing a prior special statute [(such as RA 9211 or the Tobacco 
Regulation Act of 2003)], will ordinarily not affect the special 
provisions of such earlier statute."
[16]

 In this light, it is therefore my considered view that RA 9711 merely 
supplies the deficiencies in RA 9211 with respect to the health aspects 
of tobacco products (
e.g
., the amount of nicotine in tobacco products), which the latter does not cover. 
 In fine, as correctly ruled by the 
ponencia
,
 Article III, Book II of the FDA IRR pertaining to tobacco should be 
upheld. As envisioned by the lawmakers, "the new FDA is the authority as
 far as health is concerned." To be sure, this Article recognizes that 
the mandate of the FDA is only limited to the products' health aspects 
and in tum, respects the mandates of specialized agencies, which include
 the IAC-Tobacco:

DISSENTING OPINION


 
CAGUIOA, 
J
.:
 The 
ponencia
 grants the petition for review on 
certiorari
 of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which seeks to reverse the Decision
[1]

 of Branch 255, Regional Trial Court of Las PiÃ±as City (RTC) declaring 
void the provisions of the Rules and Regulations Implementing Republic 
Act (R.A.) No. 9711 insofar as they regulate tobacco products and the 
tobacco industry.
[2]
 The 
ponencia

 holds that due to the known health hazards of tobacco products, these 
are "health products" within the definition of R.A. No. 9711, or the FDA
 Act of 2009. The DOH, in coordination with the FDA, is deemed to have 
acted within the confines of R.A. No. 9711 when it tasked the FDA with 
the responsibility of regulating tobacco and tobacco products in its 
implementing rules and regulations.
[3]
 I dissent.

 The sole purpose of the rule-making power of an administrative agency 
is to implement the provisions of the delegating statute. For this 
purpose, the exercise of this power is necessarily limited to filling in
 the details of the statute. The administrative agency should craft the 
implementing regulation in conformity with the law it seeks to implement
 and cannot unduly expand the statute's application. To hold otherwise 
is to allow administrative agencies to venture into the amendment or 
repeal of a statute â a power that lies exclusively with Congress.
[4]

 In this case, the Court is asked to resolve whether R.A. No. 9711 
contemplates the regulation of tobacco products. I disagree with the 
ponencia
 that it is "illogical"
[5]

 to place tobacco and tobacco products outside the regulatory authority 
of the FDA. The DOH cannot arrogate unto itself the authority to 
designate the FDA as an additional regulatory body over tobacco and 
tobacco products. By providing this in the implementing rules of R.A. 
No. 9711, the DOH effectively expanded its application beyond the 
confines of the FDA's enabling law. I maintain that the Court should 
refrain from reading into the law what is not written in its text. I 
respectfully submit this Opinion to elaborate on my position and to 
emphasize the Court's duties in delineating the boundaries of the 
exercise of the delegated rule-making power of administrative agencies. 
 
 I. 
 
 

 Preliminarily, I disagree with the submission of Associate Justice Amy 
C. Lazaro-Javier (Justice Lazaro-Javier) that this case presents no 
actual case or controversy.
[6]
 

 Under Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution, courts are empowered
 "to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally 
demandable and enforceable."
[7]

 Thus, even with the expanded power of judicial review, courts cannot 
adjudicate cases on the basis of hypothetical or assumed facts. There 
should be "a contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted and 
enforced on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence."
[8]

 In addition, the question presented should also be ripe for 
adjudication â meaning, there must be an "immediate or threatened injury
 to [the petitioner] as a result of the challenged action."
[9]
 The court can only intervene when the act complained of on the part of the government is a "completed action"
[10]
 giving rise to a "direct, concrete, and adverse effect on the petitioner."
[11]

 The requirement of an actual case or controversy proceeds from the 
elementary principle of separation of powers, which prevents courts from
 intruding into areas committed to other branches of the government.
[12]

 There is no question, therefore, that these procedural prerequisites to
 the exercise of judicial review are imperative. However, I disagree 
with the view of Justice Lazaro-Javier that respondent Philippine 
Tobacco Institute, Inc. (PTI) could only raise "apprehensions and 
speculations of harassments"
[13]

 on the conflicting interpretations on the extent of the FDA's or the 
DOH's rule-making authority. Justice Lazaro-Javier further opines that, 
absent actual facts, the Court dangerously ventures into making policy 
decisions.
[14]
 
 As stated at the outset, I disagree with this view. It is clear from the 
ponencia

 that the main issue in this case is the validity of the DOH's exercise 
of its rule-making power pursuant to R.A. No. 9711. In particular, 
respondent PTI assails the provisions of the Rules and Regulations 
Implementing R.A. No. 9711, which included tobacco and other tobacco 
products within the regulatory authority of the FDA. PTI argues that 
there is nothing in R.A. No. 9711, the delegating statute, which covers 
tobacco or tobacco products. Petitioners DOH and FDA, and 
petitioner-intervenors Senator Pilar Juliana Cayetano and Senator 
Franklin Drilon, on the other hand, disagree. They insist that the 
mandate of the FDA, as well as the definition of "health products" under
 R.A. No. 9711,
[15]
 is broad 
enough to include tobacco and tobacco products. Petitioners are 
contrarily asserting that Section 25 of R.A. No. 9711 confers to the FDA
 regulatory power over matters not within the ambit of R.A. No. 9211,
[16]
 or the "Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003."
[17]
 

 In view of the foregoing, it is therefore untenable to argue that PTI 
is anchoring its claim on mere speculations. Surely, a determination on 
the validity of the provisions on the implementing rules directly 
affects the tobacco companies constituting PTI, as they would have to 
comply with the FDA's regulatory guidelines should the challenged 
provisions be upheld. 
 Furthermore, it is important to contextualize the requirement of "actual facts of injury or threats of injury"
[18]
 in determining whether the case presents a justiciable controversy. In 
SPARK v. Quezon City
,
[19]
 the Court notably found that there exists an actual case or controversy "given the evident clash of the parties' legal claims."
[20]

 Even without "actual facts," the Court proceeded to rule on the 
constitutionality of the curfew ordinances in several cities in Metro 
Manila, based on the assertions of the petitioners therein that the 
ordinances impair their constitutional rights. 
 In a similar manner, the Court, in
 Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison v. De Lima
,
[21]

 proceeded to pass upon the validity of the implementing rules to the 
statutory amendments on the computation of good conduct time allowance. 
The respondents therein directly argued that there was no actual case or
 controversy, and any claim of injury was premature and anticipatory. 
The Court, notably with the concurrence of Justice Lazaro-Javier, 
explicitly rejected the proposition that there should be concrete acts 
before the case becomes justiciable, thus: 
  


 
 There is an actual case or controversy in the case at bar 
because there is a contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted 
and enforced on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence.
 
Respondents stand for the prospective application of the grant of GCTA, 
TASTM, and STAL while petitioners and intervenors view that such 
provision violates the Constitution and Article 22 of the RPC. 
The 
legal issue posed is ripe for adjudication as the challenged regulation 
has a direct adverse effect on petitioners and those detained and 
convicted prisoners who are similarly situated.
 There exists an 
immediate and/or threatened injury and they have sustained or are 
immediately in danger of sustaining direct injury as a result of the act
 complained of. In fact, while the case is pending, petitioners are 
languishing in jail. If their assertion proved to be true, their illegal
 confinement or detention in the meantime is oppressive. With the 
prisoners' continued incarceration, any delay in resolving the case 
would cause them great prejudice. Justice demands that they be released 
soonest, if not on time. 


 There is no need to wait and see the actual organization and operation of the MSEC. Petitioners Edago,
 et al
., correctly invoked Our ruling in 
Pimentel, Jr. v. Hon. Aguirre
.
 There, We dismissed the novel theory that people should wait for the 
implementing evil to befall on them before they could question acts that
 are illegal or unconstitutional, and held that 
"(by) the mere 
enactment of the questioned law or the approval of the challenged 
action, the dispute is said to have ripened into a judicial controversy 
even without any other overt act."
 Similar to
 Pimentel, Jr
., 
the real issue in this case is whether the Constitution and the RPC are 
contravened by Section 4, Rule 1 of the IRR, not whether they are 
violated by the acts implementing it. 
Concrete acts are not necessary
 to render the present controversy ripe. An actual case may exist even 
in the absence of tangible instances when the assailed IRR has actually 
and adversely affected petitioners. The mere issuance of the subject IRR
 has led to the ripening of a judicial controversy even without any 
other overt act.
 If this Court cannot await the adverse consequences
 of the law in order to consider the controversy actual and ripe for 
judicial intervention, the same can be said for an IRR. Here, 
petitioners need not wait for the creation of the MSEC and be 
individually rejected in their applications. They do not need to 
actually apply for the revised credits, considering that such 
application would be an exercise in futility in view of respondents' 
insistence that the law should be prospectively applied. If the assailed
 provision is indeed unconstitutional and illegal, there is no better 
time than the present action to settle such question once and for all.
[22]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 It is clear from the foregoing that the requirement of an actual 
case or controversy is satisfied when there is a contrariety of legal 
rights. Here, the parties rely on their respective interpretations of 
the related laws to bolster their position on whether tobacco and 
tobacco products are within the FDA's regulatory framework. The conflict
 between the administrative issuance of the DOH on the one hand, and the
 statute reorganizing the FDA on the other, is evidently not an issue 
that requires 
overt
 facts before the Court may adjudicate.
 In fact, the DOH and the FDA directly filed this Rule 45 petition with 
the Court on pure questions of law after the RTC had determined that the
 DOH overstepped its quasi-legislative authority in promulgating the 
assailed implementing rules. I therefore take exception to the 
submission of Justice Lazaro-Javier that there are no actual facts of 
injury, which effectively constrains the Court to render an opinion "on a
 state of assumed and hypothetical facts."
[23]

 Verily, the requirement of actual case or controversy should not be 
confused and equated with the existence of overt acts, as issues in a 
case do not necessarily become "abstract, hypothetical or contingent 
questions" simply because there were no overt acts that preceded the 
filing of the petition. 
 In this connection, the remedy availed 
of in this case â a petition for declaratory relief â precisely 
contemplates scenarios where there are actual cases or controversies, 
but there has yet to be any overt act that constitutes any breach or 
violation of the statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or 
any other governmental regulation in question. To recall, the Rule 63 of
 the Rules of Court provides that: 
  


 SECTION 1. 
Who may file petition
. â Any person interested
 under a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, whose rights 
are affected by a statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or 
any other governmental regulation may, 
before breach or violation thereof
,
 bring an action in the appropriate Regional Trial Court to determine 
any question of construction or validity arising, and for a declaration 
of his rights or duties, thereunder. (Emphasis supplied) 




 According to jurisprudence, the requisites of an action for declaratory relief are: 
  


 1] the subject matter of the controversy must be a deed, will, 
contract or other written instrument, statute, executive order or 
regulation, or ordinance; 2] the terms of said documents and the 
validity thereof are doubtful and require judicial construction; 3] 
there must have been no breach of the documents in question; 4] there 
must be an actual justiciable controversy or the "ripening seeds" of one
 between persons whose interests are adverse; 5] the issue must be ripe 
for judicial determination; and 6] adequate relief is not available 
through other means or other forms of action or proceeding.
[24]
 




 Clear from the foregoing requisites is that it is enough that 
there be at least two adverse interests to constitute an actual 
justiciable controversy, and that the existence of an overt act is not 
only not required to be present, 
but is actually required to be absent
. 
 In 
Caltex v. Palomar
,
[25]

 there were no overt acts yet that were done before judicial 
intervention was sought through a petition for declaratory relief. 
Caltex simply publicized a contest which would involve the use of mails,
 and it just sought clearance from the Postmaster General to use the 
facilities of the post office â which the latter denied because it 
deemed the contest violative of the anti-lottery provisions of the 1983 
Administrative Code. There was as yet no person who tried to participate
 in the contest by sending mail matter through the post office who was 
refused. There was as yet no "facts" as Justice Lazaro-Javier requires.
[26]

 Nevertheless, the Court ruled on the petition as there was an actual 
case or controversy given the contrariety of legal rights as asserted by
 Caltex and the Postmaster General. 
 On the other hand, in 
Ollada v. Central Bank
,
[27]

 the Court dismissed the petition for declaratory relief because 
petitioner's right had already been violated before the petition for 
declaratory relief was filed. Insisting on the requisite that there must
 be no breach or violation before a petition for declaratory relief is 
filed, the Court said: 
  


 Petitioner commenced this action as, and clearly intended it to 
be one for Declaratory Relief under the provisions of Rule 66 of the 
Rules of Court. On the question of when a special civil action of this 
nature would prosper, we have already held that the 
complaint for declaratory relief will not prosper if filed after a contract, statute or right has been breached or violated
.
 In the present case such is precisely the situation arising from the 
facts alleged in the petition for declaratory relief. As vigorously 
claimed by petitioner himself, respondent had already invaded or 
violated his right and caused him injury â all these giving him a 
complete cause of action enforceable in an appropriate ordinary civil 
action or proceeding. The dismissal of the action was, therefore, proper
 in the light of our ruling in De Borja vs. Villadolid, 47 O.G. (5) p. 
2315, and Samson vs. Andal, G.R. No. L-3439, July 31, 1951 where 
we
 held that an action for declaratory relief should be filed before there
 has been a breach of a contract, statute or right, and that it is 
sufficient, to bar such action, that there had been a breach â which 
would constitute actionable violation
. The rule is that an 
action for Declaratory Relief is proper only if adequate relief is not 
available through the means of other existing forms of action or 
proceeding (1 C.J.S. 1027-1028).
[28]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 Respectfully, it is therefore error to require overt acts or 
"actual injury" in this case before the same could be said to be ripe 
for adjudication. It is simply incongruent to ask the same, especially 
in a case involving a petition for declaratory relief. 
 Finally, 
the Court need not speculate on the provisions of R.A. No. 9711 or the 
other relevant statutes on tobacco regulation in order to determine the 
boundaries of the DOH's rule-making power. The only necessary and 
undisputed fact in this case is the DOH's promulgation of the Rules and 
Regulations Implementing R.A. No. 9711, which gives rise to an actual 
controversy susceptible of judicial resolution. Needless to state, where
 an action of a political department is alleged to have infringed the 
Constitution or contravened a law, there should be no question on the 
propriety of the Court's exercise of its judicial power of review.
[29]
 
 
 
II.
 
 
 On the merits, I respectfully disagree with the 
ponencia

 in ruling that the provisions of the Rules and Regulations Implementing
 R.A. No. 9711, insofar as they placed tobacco and tobacco products 
within the regulatory authority of the FDA, are valid. I submit that the
 relevant provisions of the implementing rules were correctly stricken 
down by the RTC as an excessive exercise of the DOH and the FDA's 
rule-making authority under R.A. No. 9711. 
 The Court recognizes 
that the principle of subordinate legislation is necessary for the 
legislature to adapt to the numerous issues confronting the government. 
By entrusting administrative agencies with the task of filling in the 
details of the law, "administrative bodies may implement the broad 
policies laid down in a statute x x x which the Congress may not have 
the opportunity or competence to provide."
[30]
 These implementing rules have the force and effect of law.
[31]

 Nevertheless, this delegated rule-making power is not a legislative 
function but only a mechanism for the implementation of the law. The 
administrative agency is confined to supplying details within the scope 
of the statutory authority granted to it by the legislature. As aptly 
noted by Associate Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando (Justice Hernando), 
the "specialized jurisdiction of administrative bodies x x x is not a 
license to expand, extend, or add anything to the law it seeks to 
implement thereby."
[32]
 

 This, to my mind, is the most significant consideration in this case. 
The delegated rule-making power of administrative agencies is 
circumscribed by the provisions of the Constitution or a law, especially
 the statute it administers, or which created it. The exercise of the 
quasi-legislative power cannot derogate or defeat the purpose of a 
statute, or expand its application. It is, at all times, confined within
 the four walls of the delegating statute. Any conflict between the 
statute and the implementing rule must be resolved in favor of the 
former:
[33]




 As early as 1970, in the case of 
Teoxon vs. Members of the Board of Administrators (PVA)
,
 we ruled that the power to promulgate rules in the implementation of a 
statute is necessarily limited to what is provided for in the 
legislative enactment. Its terms must be followed for an administrative 
agency cannot amend an Act of Congress. "The rule-making power must be 
confined to details for regulating the mode or proceedings to carry into
 effect the law as it has been enacted, and it cannot be extended to 
amend or expand the statutory requirements or to embrace matters not 
covered by the statute." If a discrepancy occurs between the basic law 
and an implementing rule or regulation, it is the former that prevails.
[34]
 




 
 III. 
 
 
 In this 
case, R.A. No. 9711 reorganized the FDA and strengthened its mandate by 
broadening its jurisdiction from "food, drug and cosmetic"
[35]
 to "health products" as defined under the law. Section 9 of R.A. No. 9711 defines "health products" as follows: 
  


 (ff) 'Health products' means food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, 
biologicals, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and household/urban 
hazardous substances and/or a combination of and/or a derivative 
thereof. It shall also refer to products that may have an effect on 
health which require regulations as determined by the FDA. 




 The DOH was tasked to craft the implementing rules and regulations of R.A. No. 9711.
[36]

 For this purpose, it promulgated the Rules and Regulations Implementing
 R.A. No. 9711, which included the following contentious provisions: 
 ARTICLE III 
Tobacco and Other Products
  


 SECTION 1. 
Rationale
. â 
The FDA has full jurisdiction over the regulation of all health products.
 


 SECTION 2. 
Tobacco
. â T
he DOH, tasked with protecting 
the public's health against the injurious effects arising from the use 
of tobacco and tobacco products, has the responsibility of regulating 
tobacco and tobacco products through the FDA.
 








a.


 
Rules and Other 
Issuances to Implement this Section. Within a reasonable period from the
 date of effectivity of these Rules and Regulations, the FDA shall 
prepare and recommend for the approval to the Secretary of Health, the 
appropriate rules and regulations and other issuances to implement this 
Section.














b. 


Protection against Tobacco Industry 
Interference. The FDA shall act to protect the formulation and 
implementation of rules and regulations under this Section from 
commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry, including
 organizations, entities, associations, individuals, and others that 
work to further the interests of the tobacco industry. 








The FDA shall not deal with the tobacco industry or individuals 
or entities that work to further the interests of the tobacco industry, 
except to the extent strictly necessary to effectively regulate, 
supervise, or control the tobacco industry in relation to tobacco and 
tobacco products. 


 SECTION 3. 
Other Products
. â Nothing in the FDA Act of 
2009 shall be deemed to modify the jurisdiction of other specialized 
agencies and special laws only insofar as the acts covered by these 
specialized agencies and laws except the health aspects of such 
products. 


 SECTION 4. 
Identification of Policy Areas
. â The FDA 
shall promulgate the appropriate rules and regulations and other 
issuances to identify and define the policy areas that are not covered 
by specialized agencies and special laws, including, but not limited to,
 those covered by Republic Act No. 9211, Executive Order No. 245, 
Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468.
[37]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The DOH and FDA argue that by virtue of the second sentence in the
 definition of "health products," any product that has an "effect on 
health" may be regulated by the FDA. They maintain that this includes 
tobacco and tobacco products, the health aspect of which may be subject 
to FDA regulation.
[38]
 This argument, to my mind, is belied by a holistic reading of R.A. No. 9711, in relation to tobacco-specific legislation. 

 In order to arrive at the true meaning of "health products," the Court 
must not read the second sentence of its definition in isolation. It 
must be considered together with the other parts of R.A. No. 9711, 
particularly, with respect to Section 25 of the law, which states: 
  


 SECTION 25. 
Coverage
. â This Act shall govern all health products: 
Provided
,
 That nothing in this Act shall be deemed to modify the sole and 
exclusive jurisdiction of other specialized agencies and special laws 
only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws
,
 including, but not limited to, those covered by Republic Act No. 9211, 
Executive Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree
 No. 1468. (Emphasis supplied) 




 As I see it, this provision carves out tobacco and tobacco 
products from the regulatory authority of the FDA, even with respect to 
the health aspect thereof. Contrary to the 
ponencia
's claims, 
this reading is certainly not illogical as this is supported not only by
 R.A. No. 9711, but by R.A. No. 9211 as well. 
 The adverse effect
 of tobacco and tobacco products on a person's health is 
well-established. This is not an issue in this case and neither should 
this be the sole consideration in determining whether a product is a 
"health product." R.A. No. 9211, or the "Tobacco Regulation Act of 
2003," recognizes the dangers of using tobacco products, as well as the 
need for a balanced policy on "the use, sale and advertisements of 
tobacco products x x x to promote a healthful environment and protect 
the citizens from the hazards of tobacco smoke, and at the same time 
ensure that the interest of tobacco fanners, growers, workers and 
stakeholders are not adversely compromised."
[39]

 Among the purposes of R.A. No. 9211 is to promote a healthful 
environment and provide the public with information as to the health 
risks associated with cigarette smoking and tobacco use.
[40]
 

 In line with this, R.A. No. 9211 created the Inter-Agency Committee â 
Tobacco (IAC-T), which possesses the "exclusive power and function to 
administer and implement the provisions"
[41]

 of the Act. The IAC-T is headed by the Secretary of the Department of 
Trade and Industry (DTI) as the Chairperson and the DOH Secretary as the
 Vice Chairperson,
[42]
 
consistent with the declared policy to balance the right to health with 
the interests of tobacco farmers, growers, workers, and other 
stakeholders.
[43]
 
 The IAC-T is tasked to oversee the implementation of R.A. No. 9211, which regulates the marketing
[44]
 and labelling of tobacco products,
[45]
 as well as its use,
[46]
 sale, and distribution.
[47]

 The DOH, on the other hand, was specifically tasked to conduct a 
continuous information program on the harmful effects of smoking.
[48]
 
 Relatedly, R.A. No. 10643
[49]

 or the "Graphic Health Warnings Law," was recently enacted to provide a
 more stringent requirement on the labels and packaging of cigarettes 
and tobacco products. This is in line with the World Health 
Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which the 
Philippines is a party. This legislation also reiterates the state 
policy to promote the right to health and aims to protect consumers from
 "trade malpractices and substandard tobacco products."
[50]

 Several implementing agencies, including the IAC-T, were designated 
with specific roles to ensure compliance with R.A. No. 10643, to wit: 
  


 SECTION 16. 
Implementing Agencies
. â For purposes of the implementation of this Act, the following government agencies are given these mandates: 








(1)


 
The DOH shall issue the templates as required under Sections 6, 7 and 15. 






 


 






(2)


The BIR shall ensure that cigarette 
stamps are not affixed on noncompliant packages and shall certify under 
oath that the products withdrawn are compliant with this Act.






 


 






(3)


The Inter-Agency Committee on 
Tobacco (IAC-T) created under Republic Act No. 9211 or the Tobacco 
Regulation Act of 2003 shall monitor compliance with the law, and 
motu proprio

 or upon any sworn written complaint, institute the appropriate action 
for any violation of this Act as provided under Section 14 and this 
section.
 






 


 






(4)


The DTI shall hear complaints 
filed by the IAC-T or any private citizen, corporation or organization, 
for any violation of this Act, and after notice and hearing, impose 
administrative fines of not more than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) 
for any violation of this Act, the proceeds of which will be used for 
health promotion campaigns on tobacco control of the DOH and the 
Department of Education (DepEd). 
The imposition of the 
administrative fines shall take into consideration the annual gross 
sales, capital investment and employee size of the manufacturers, 
importers and distributors, and in the case of retailers and sellers, 
their total assets. 






 


 






(5)


The DepEd shall use Graphic Health 
Warnings templates to educate children on the ill-effects of tobacco and
 shall ensure that these are included in relevant subjects under the 
K-12 curriculum. 








Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, the 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) Committee led by the DOH and 
the DTI, and to be composed of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 
Department of Finance (DOF), the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR), the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the 
DepEd, the National Tobacco Administration (NTA) and the Department of 
Agriculture (DA) shall draft and issue the IRR for its effective 
implementation, after public consultations with stakeholders such as 
NGOs, farmers, and industry representatives: 
Provided
, That the non-issuance of the IRR shall not prevent the coming into force of this Act. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The manufacture of tobacco and tobacco products, on the other hand, is regulated by the National Tobacco Administration (NTA).
[51]

 While it does not primarily regulate the health aspect of tobacco 
products, it is mandated to enforce the relevant rules on the 
"production, standardization, classification, grading and trading of 
tobacco and tobacco products as may be necessary to attain its purposes 
and objectives 
and to pursue the policy of government on tobacco
."
[52]

 In this regard, I respectfully disagree with how Senior Associate 
Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe (Justice Perlas-Bernabe) reconciles 
R.A. No. 9211 and R.A. No. 9711. She submits that R.A. No. 9711 is the 
general law on health products, which grants "the FDA regulatory 
jurisdiction only over the health aspect of tobacco products,"
[53]

 while R.A. No. 9211 may be considered a special law on tobacco and 
tobacco products, which grants the IAC-T regulatory jurisdiction over 
"all the other aspects of tobacco products."
[54]

 With due respect, bifurcating the regulatory framework of tobacco and 
tobacco products into "all other aspects" and "health aspects" fails to 
consider and properly appreciate the overarching structure set up by the
 Legislature regarding tobacco and tobacco products. 
 As 
mentioned, the DOH, to which the FDA is attached, is already part of the
 IAC-T. In fact, the DOH Secretary is not only a member, but a Vice 
Chairperson of the IAC-T.
[55]
 
This fact alone belies Justice Perlas-Bernabe's line of reasoning that 
R.A. No. 9711 was meant to regulate only the "health aspect" of tobacco 
and tobacco products whereas R.A. No. 9211 was meant to regulate only 
"all other aspects." To be sure, the DOH Secretary would not be made a 
part of the IAC-T if this view is correct. 
 Indeed, what is clear
 from the laws passed by the Legislature is that the government had 
adopted a multi-sectoral approach in regulating tobacco and tobacco 
products, considering the various components underlying the production 
of tobacco. For this purpose, the IAC-T is not only composed of the DOH 
Secretary, but also the Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture, 
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the DTI, among 
others.
[56]
 Thus, if the Court
 were to consider the "health aspect" separable from all other aspects, 
it follows that the various agencies comprising the IAC-T would likewise
 have regulatory jurisdiction over the corresponding "aspect" relevant 
to their agency. In my view, this contravenes the underlying purpose in 
the creation of an inter-agency arrangement, and the explicit functions 
of the IAC-T. 
 Indeed, a careful reading of R.A. No. 9211 reveals
 that in the regulation of the so-called other "aspects," such as 
packaging, use, sale, distribution, and advertisements,
[57]

 the IAC-T does so already cognizant of the effects of tobacco products 
on a person's health in line with the declared State policy to protect 
its citizens from the hazards of tobacco products and tobacco smoke, 
viz
.: 
  


 SECTION 2. 
Policy
. - It is the policy of the State 
to protect the populace from hazardous products and promote the right to health and instill health consciousness among them
.
 It is also the policy of the State, consistent with the Constitutional 
ideal to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the interests of the 
workers and other stakeholders in the tobacco industry. For these 
purposes, the government shall institute a 
balanced policy
 whereby 
the
 use, sale and advertisements of tobacco products shall be regulated in 
order to promote a healthful environment and protect the citizens from 
the hazards of tobacco smoke, 
and at the same time ensure
 that the interests of tobacco farmers, growers, workers and stakeholders are not adversely compromised. 








SECTION 3.
 Purpose
. â It is the main thrust of this Act to:






a.


Promote a healthful environment; 






b.


Inform the public of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking and tobacco use;
 






c.


Regulate and subsequently ban all tobacco advertisements and sponsorships;
 






d.


Regulate the labeling of tobacco products;






e.


Protect the youth from being initiated to cigarette 
smoking and tobacco use by prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to 
minors;






f.


Assist and encourage Filipino tobacco farmers to cultivate alternative agricultural crops to prevent economic dislocation; and






g.


Create an Inter-Agency Committee on Tobacco (IAC-Tobacco) to oversee the implementation of the provisions of this Act
. (Emphasis, italics, and underscoring supplied)










On this point, I agree with Justice Hernando's Dissenting Opinion 
in which he aptly points out that the mandate of the FDA is to ensure 
the safety of health products. For this purpose, it has the authority to
 recall products, which are found to have "caused the death, serious 
illness or serious injury to a consumer or patient" or "imminently 
injurious, unsafe, dangerous, or grossly deceptive."
[58]

 In light of the State's recognition of the health risks arising from 
the use of tobacco and tobacco products, it is incongruous for the FDA 
to simply "regulate" tobacco. The DOH is even tasked under R.A. No. 9211
 to "enlist the active participation of the public and private sectors 
in the national effort to discourage the unhealthy habit of smoking."
[59]


 In other words, it is untenable to argue that the FDA should 
regulate the health aspect of tobacco products and, in the same breath, 
acknowledge its adverse effects on the health. If the Court were to 
uphold the regulatory authority of the FDA, the exercise of its 
statutory mandate would essentially result in the prohibition â not the 
regulation â of tobacco and tobacco products,
[60]

 simply by virtue of an implementing rule. This effectively renders the 
powers of the IAC-T nugatory, and runs counter to the explicit purposes 
for which it was constituted. The proposed harmonization therefore would
 likely cause an administrative nightmare than harmony. 
 
In
 fine, the statutory measures meant to regulate tobacco and tobacco 
products are all already premised on the harmful effects that these have
 on a person's health.
 This is acknowledged by these tobaccoÂ­ specific statutes and by other executive issuances such as: Executive Order No. 26,
[61]
 which provides for the establishment of smoke-free places,
[62]
 and Executive Order No. 106,
[63]
 which prohibits the manufacture and sale of unregistered and adulterated heated tobacco products.
[64]
 
The
 regulation of the health aspect of tobacco products is therefore 
already intrinsically woven into the respective mandates of the IAC-T 
and the NTA.
 Accordingly, I disagree with the majority's view 
that any product which has an "effect on health" covers tobacco and 
tobacco products that can be made subject to the FDA's authority under 
R.A. No. 9711.
 It goes without saying that practically all 
products have an "effect on health." Take for instance firearms, which 
could arguably fall within this meaning because of the risks it poses to
 the health and safety of its owner and the public â not unlike the 
adverse and harmful effects of tobacco and tobacco products. As well, 
gasoline, whether ingested or used as fuel for motor vehicles, could be 
reasonably construed as a health product if the Court were to follow the
 same line of argument. That said, it is inconceivable to consider these
 products as health products that the FDA can regulate. Again, this 
interpretation is not only contradicted by the clear text of Section 25 
of R.A. No. 9711, but would result in an absurd conclusion that grants 
the DOH and the FDA absolute authority over any and all products, even 
those outside their administrative expertise. 
 What the DOH and FDA are trying to do is to 
encroach on the authority and jurisdiction of the agencies

 to which Congress had explicitly granted the power to regulate tobacco 
and tobacco products. Thus, to grant the FDA this power is tantamount to
 repealing or amending the laws which created these agencies and which 
delineated the coverage of their respective authorities. This cannot be 
done â 
as this can only be done through the enactment of a new law
 and not through the DOH's promulgation of the rules and regulation 
implementing the FDA's charter
. 
 In this light, the 
Court's inquiry on whether the DOH validly exercised its delegated 
rule-making power should be answered in the negative. Notwithstanding 
the language in Section 9 of R.A. No. 9711 which defines "health 
products" as those that may have an "effect on health," neither the FDA 
nor the DOH has unbridled discretion to fill in the details of the law. 
Read in conjunction with Section 25 thereof, products and substances 
that are subject of special laws and specialized agencies are outside 
the operation of the law. Section 25 therefore qualifies the definition 
of "health products." 
 As such, the exercise of quasi-legislative power by the DOH is circumscribed by standards in R.A. No. 9711 
as a whole
.
 The DOH therefore exceeded the bounds of its authority when it expanded
 the coverage of the statute it sought to implement. On this point, the 
Court's ruling in 
United BF Homeowner's Association v. BF Homes, Inc
.
[65]
 is enlightening: 
  


 
Moreover, where the legislature has delegated [to executive] 
or administrative officers and boards authority to promulgate rules to 
carry out an express legislative purpose, the rules of administrative 
officers and boards, which have the effect of extending, or which 
conflict with the authority-granting statute, do not represent a valid 
exercise of the rule-making power but constitute an attempt by an 
administrative body to legislate. 
"A statutory grant of powers 
should not be extended by implication beyond what may be necessary for 
their just and reasonable execution." It is axiomatic that a rule or 
regulation must bear upon, and be consistent with, the provisions of the
 enabling statute if such rule or regulation is to be valid.
[66]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 The expertise and competence of the FDA to ensure the safety and 
efficacy of health products is not in question. However, its authority 
to regulate should emanate from the law. It is not up to the DOH to 
craft the policy of the government insofar as the regulation of tobacco 
and tobacco products is concerned. Allowing the unfettered exercise of 
the rule-making power effectively sanctions the DOH or the FDA's 
exercise of policy-making powers, as their sole discretion on the scope 
and definition of "health products" would always prevail.
 In all, I vote to

DISSENTING OPINION


 
HERNANDO, 
J
.:
 I maintain that the Department 
of Health (DOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exceeded 
their rule-making powers in promulgating Article III, Book II of the FDA
 Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) which listed tobacco products 
as health products and carved out the FDA's regulatory jurisdiction over
 the same. 
 Article III, Book II of the FDA IRR shows that it 
indeed unduly expands Republic Act No. (RA) 9711, or The Food and Drug 
Administration Act of 2009 (FDA Act). While the delegation to the FDA to
 determine what are health products is proper, complete in itself, and 
with sufficient standards, the FDA IRR's provisions on tobacco products 
go beyond the purview of RA 9711, are inconsistent with RA 9711's 
provisions, and are contrary to other laws involving tobacco specific 
legislation.
 
First
. On its face, RA 9711 does not purport 
to regulate tobacco products. Textually, the whole of RA 9711 does not 
mention tobacco products. It does not define tobacco products or declare
 a special treatment for tobacco products as a specific health concern. 
 Sections 3
[1]
 and 4
[2]

 of RA 9711 pronounce the overall poiicy and objectives of the law to 
strengthen and rationalize the regulatory capacity of the FDA to ensure 
the safety of food, medicine, health products, and the like made 
available to the public. Clearly, RA 9711 seeks to establish and 
maintain an effective health product regulatory system. 
 In
 Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr
.
[3]
 
(Imbong)
,
 the Court sustained the delegation by Congress to the FDA, under RA 
10354, or The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 
2012,
[4]
 the determination of whether a supply or product is to be included in the essential drugs list, was sustained by the Court.
 Imbong

 held that the functions, powers and duties of the FDA are specific to 
enable the agency to carry out the mandates of the law, thus: 
  


 The petitioners likewise question the delegation by Congress to 
the FDA of the power to determine whether or not a supply or product is 
to be included in the Essential Drugs List 
(EDL)
. 


 The Court finds nothing wrong with the delegation. The FDA does 
not only have the power but also the competency to evaluate, register 
and cover health services and methods. It is the only government entity 
empowered to render such services and highly proficient to do so. It 
should be understood that health services and methods fall under the 
gamut of terms that are associated with what is ordinarily understood as
 "health products." In this connection, Section 4 of R.A. No. 3720, as 
amended by R.A. No. 9711 reads: 




 SEC. 4. To carry out the provisions of this Act, there is 
hereby created an office to be called the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in the Department of Health (DOH). Said Administration shall be 
under the Office of the Secretary and shall have the following 
functions, powers and duties: 


 x x x x


 "(c) 
To	analyze	and	inspect	health	products
 in connection with the implementation of this Act; 


 x x x x


 "(h) 
To conduct appropriate tests on all applicable health 
products prior to the issuance of appropriate authorizations to ensure 
safety, efficacy, purity, and quality;


 x x x x


 "(k) 
After due process, to order the ban, recall, and/or 
withdrawal of any health product found to have caused death, serious 
illness or serious injury to a consumer or patient, or is found to be 
imminently injurious, unsafe, dangerous, or grossly deceptive
, and 
to require all concerned to implement the risk management plan which is a
 requirement for the issuance of the appropriate authorization; 


 x x x x




 As can be gleaned from the above, the functions, powers and 
duties of the FDA are specific to enable the agency to carry out the 
mandates of the law. Being the country's premiere and sole agency that 
ensures the safety of food and medicines available to the public, the 
FDA was equipped with the necessary powers and functions to make it 
effective. Pursuant to the principle of necessary implication, the 
mandate by Congress to the FDA to ensure public health and safety by 
permitting only food and medicines that are safe includes "service" and 
"methods." From the declared policy of the RH Law, it is clear that 
Congress intended that the public be given only those medicines that are
 proven medically safe, legal, non-abortifacient, and effective in 
accordance with scientific and evidence-based medical research 
standards. x x x
[5]
 




 In 
Imbong
, the Court affirmed Congress's determination that
 reproductive health products, which necessarily include services and 
methods, are to be regulated by the FDA pursuant to its powers.
[6]

 Significantly, the RH Law explicitly legislated for regulation by the 
FDA reproductive health products, services and methods pursuant to the 
RH law's declared policy to provide the public only those medicines and 
health products that are proven medically safe, legal, 
non-abortifacient, and effective. 
 In marked contrast, there was 
no such delegation by Congress to the FDA in the present case. It is the
 DOH and the FDA, and not Congress, that effectively determined first 
that tobacco products are health products which ought to be regulated by
 the FDA. Ultimately, the exercise of the rule-making power is improper;
 petitioners' determination that tobacco products are health products is
 incorrect. 
 On several occasions, we have disallowed an excess of administrative rule-making power no matter its avowed public purpose.
[7]

 The consistent stance of the Court has been that the specialized 
jurisdiction of administrative bodies which impels the allowance of 
delegation of legislative powers is not a license to expand, extend, or 
add anything to the law it seeks to implement thereby.
[8]
 In 
MCC Industrial Sales Corporation v. Ssangyong Corporation
[9]

 (MCC), the Court reaffirmed the basic tenet that the power of 
administrative officials to promulgate rules in the implementation of a 
law is necessarily limited to what is found in the legislative 
enactment. The reinstatement of a phrase in the IRR on the definition of
 an electronic data message which had already been deleted by Congress 
in the ultimate enactment of the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, RA 
8792, albeit lifted from the Model Law on Electronic Commerce adopted by
 the UNCITRAL
[10]
 from which 
majority of the provisions of the law were taken, expands the coverage 
of the law which an implementing rule and regulation cannot do. An 
implementing rule and regulation cannot extend the law or expand its 
coverage, as the power to amend or repeal a statute is vested in the 
Legislature:
  


 The inclusion of this phrase in the IRR offends a basic tenet in
 the exercise of the rule-making power of administrative agencies. After
 all, the power of administrative officials to promulgate rules in the 
implementation of a statute is necessarily limited to what is found in 
the legislative enactment itself. The implementing rules and regulations
 of a law cannot extend the law or expand its coverage, as the power to 
amend or repeal a statute is vested in the Legislature. 
Thus, if a 
discrepancy occurs between the basic law and an implementing rule or 
regulation, it is the former that prevails, because the law cannot be 
broadened by a mere administrative issuance â an administrative agency 
certainly cannot amend an act of Congress. Had the Legislature really 
wanted ordinary fax transmissions to be covered by the mantle of the 
Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, it could have easily lifted without a 
bit of tatter the entire wordings of the UNCITRAL Model Law.
[11]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted.) 




 Parenthetically, had the Legislature really intended for the FDA 
to regulate tobacco products, then it could have easily defined tobacco 
products as it did in previous legislation. In fact, Congress could have
 explicitly declared in Section 25 that RA 9711's coverage extends to 
the health aspect of certain products despite the wording of the 
proviso. Moreover, Congress could have retained the proposed section on 
the suppletory application of the FDA Act to special laws such as RA 
9211. 
 
Second
. The last paragraph of Article 7 of the 
Civil Code could not be any clearer: "Administrative or executive acts, 
orders and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to
 the laws or the Constitution." 
 In 
Review Center Association of the Philippines v. Ermita
,
[12]

 the Court struck down executive issuances, Executive Order No. 566 and 
Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 30, Series of
 2007, which provided for the CHED's regulation of review centers and 
effectively expanded the coverage of RA 7722, the Higher Education Act 
of 1994. We ruled therein that the CHED may only exercise its 
rule-making power within the confines of its jurisdiction under RA 7722:
 
  


 The scopes of EO 566 and the RIRR clearly expand the CHED's 
coverage under RA 7722. The CHED's coverage under RA 7722 is limited to 
public
 and private institutions of higher education and degree-granting 
programs in all public and private post-secondary educational 
institutions
. EO 566 directed the CHED to formulate a framework for the regulation of review centers and similar entities. 


 The definition of a review center under EO 566 shows that it refers to one which offers 
"a
 program or course of study that is intended to refresh and enhance the 
knowledge or competencies and skills of reviewees obtained in the formal
 school setting in preparation for the licensure examinations"
 given
 by the PRC. It also covers the operation or conduct of review classes 
or courses provided by individuals whether for a fee or not in 
preparation for the licensure examinations given by the PRC. 


 
A review center is not an institution of higher learning as contemplated by RA 7722.

 It does not offer a degree-granting program that would put it under the
 jurisdiction of the CHED. A review course is only intended to "refresh 
and enhance the knowledge or competencies and skills of reviewees." A 
reviewee is not even required to enroll in a review center or to take a 
review course prior to taking an examination given by the PRC. Even if a
 reviewee enrolls in a review center, attendance in a review course is 
not mandatory. The reviewee is not required to attend each review class.
 He is not required to take or pass an examination, and neither is he 
given a grade. He is also not required to submit any thesis or 
dissertation. Thus, programs given by review centers could not be 
considered "programs x x x of higher learning" that would put them under
 the jurisdiction of the CHED. 


 Further, the "similar entities" in EO 566 cover centers 
providing "review or tutorial services" in areas not covered by 
licensure examinations given by the PRC, which include, although not 
limited to, college entrance examinations, Civil Services examinations, 
and tutorial services. These review and tutorial services hardly qualify
 as programs of higher learning. 


 x x x x


 
Administrative agencies exercise their quasi-legislative or 
rule-making power through the promulgation of rules and regulations. The
 CHED may only exercise its rule-making power within the confines of its
 jurisdiction under RA 7722. The RIRR covers review centers and similar 
entities which are neither institutions of higher education nor 
institutions offering degree-granting programs
.

 In 
Quezon City PTCA Federation, Inc. v. Department of Education
,
[14]

 the validity of Department Order (DO) No. 54, Series of 2009, which 
rationalized the mechanism for the organization and grant of official 
recognition to Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs), was upheld by the 
Court because the exercise of the rule-making power was consistent with 
the enabling statutes. It was noted that the organization of PTAs at the
 school level and approval of the school head as a prerequisite for 
organization hewed closely to the provisions of the Education Act of 
1982 and of the Child and Youth Welfare Code which expressly recognized 
the rights of parents to organize by themselves and/or with teachers. In
 contrast to PTAs and upon examination of the statutes DO No. 54 
purportedly enforces, We found that the creation and organization of 
Parent-Teacher Community Associations (PTCAs) is not statutorily 
mandated, thus:




 Petitioner insists that the Department Order is an invalid 
exercise of the rule-making power delegated to the Secretary of 
Education as it supposedly disregards PTAs' and PTCAs' purposes, not 
only as partners of the Department of Education in the implementation of
 programs, but also as a watchdog against "abuses, mismanagement, 
inefficiency[,] and excesses of public officials within the public 
school system." Petitioner also assails the Department Order's 
limitation of official recognition to PTAs, and no longer to PTCAs, as 
being contrary to law. 


 x x x x


 Petitioner is in error for asserting that the assailed 
Department Order is contrary to the statutes it aims to put into effect 
as it fails to put PTCAs on the same footing as PTAs. 


 Article 77 of the Child and Youth Welfare Code provides for the organization and purposes of PTAs: 




 Article 77. Parent-Teacher Associations. â Every elementary and secondary school shall organize a parent-teacher association 
for
 the purpose of providing a forum for the discussion of problems and 
their solutions, relating to the total school program, and for insuring 
the full cooperation of parents in the efficient implementation of such 
program
. All parents who have children enrolled in a school are 
encouraged to be active members of its PTA, and to comply with whatever 
obligations and responsibilities such membership entails. 


 Parent-Teacher Association[s] all over the country 
shall 
aid the municipal and other local authorities and school officials in 
the enforcement of juvenile delinquency control measures, and in the 
implementation of programs and activities to promote child welfare
. x x x




 The Education Act of 1982, a statute adopted subsequent to the 
Child and Youth Welfare Code, expressly recognizes the right of parents 
to organize by themselves and/or with teachers: 




 Section 8. Rights of Parents. â In addition to other rights 
under existing laws, all parents who have children enrolled in a school 
have the following rights: 


 1.	The right to organize by themselves and/or with teachers 
for
 the purpose of providing a forum for the discussion of matters relating
 to the total school program, and/or ensuring the full cooperation of 
parents and teachers in the formulation and efficient implementation of 
such programs
. 


 2.	The right to access to any official record directly 
relating to the children who are under their parental responsibility. x x
 x




 As is evident from the Child and Youth Welfare Code's use of the
 word "shall," it is mandatory for PTAs to be organized in elementary 
and secondary schools. As against this, the Child and Youth Welfare Code
 is silent on the creation of PTCAs. The Education Act of 1982 is 
equally silent on this. Hence, while the creation and/or organization of
 PTAs are statutorily mandated, the same could not be said of PTCAs. 


 However, petitioner argues differently. In support of its 
position, it cites Republic Act No. 9155, otherwise known as the Basic 
Education Act of 2001, more specifically its Section 3 (d), on its 
purposes and objectives: 




 Section 3. Purposes and Objectives. â The purposes and objectives of this Act are: 


 x x x x


 (d)	To ensure that schools and learning centers receive the 
kind of focused attention they deserve and that educational programs, 
projects and services take into account the interests of all members of 
the community[.]




 Petitioner also cites Republic Act No. 8980, otherwise known as 
the Early Childhood Care and Development Act. More specifically, 
petitioner cites Section 7(a)(1) on implementing arrangements and 
operational structures: 




 Sec. 7. 
Implementing Arrangements and Operational Structures
.
 â The implementation of the National [Early Childhood Care and 
Development or] ECCD System shall be the joint responsibility of the 
national government agencies, local government units, nongovernment 
organizations, and private organizations that are accredited to deliver 
the services or to provide training and technical assistance. 


 (a)	
Responsibilities of the National Government
 â 
National government agencies shall be responsible for developing 
policies and programs, providing technical assistance and support to the
 ECCD service providers in consultation with coordinating committees at 
the provincial, city/municipal, and barangay levels, as provided for in 
Section 8 of this Act, and monitoring of ECCD service benefits and 
outcomes. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the 
Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), the Department of 
Health (DOH), the Department of the Interior and Local Government 
(DILG), the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the Department of
 Agriculture (DA), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the National 
Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and the National Nutrition 
Council (NNC) shall jointly prepare annual ECCD for work plans that will
 coordinate their respective technical assistance and support for the 
National ECCD Program. They shall consolidate existing program 
implementing guidelines that ensure consistency in integrated service 
delivery within the National ECCD System. 


 (1)	The DECS shall promote the National ECCD Program in 
schools. ECCD programs in public schools shall be under the joint 
responsibility of their respective school principal/school-head and 
parents-teachers-community association (PTCA) within the standards set 
forth in the National ECCD System and under the guidance of the 
City/Municipal ECCD Coordinating Committee for the effective and 
equitable delivery of ECCD services. It shall also make available 
existing facilities of public elementary schools for ECCD classes. 




 Neither Republic Act No. 9155 nor Republic Act No. 8980 supports
 petitioner's contentions that PTCAs should stand on the same footing as
 PTAs and that their existence is statutorily mandated. 


 Republic Act No. 9155 does not even mention or otherwise refer 
to PTCAs. All it does is exhort that the interest of all members of the 
community should be taken into account in the administration of the 
country's basic education system. The Department Order does not run 
afoul of this. On the contrary, the Department Order specifically 
provides for PTAs' collaboration with members of the community: 




 I. General Policy


 1. Every elementary and secondary school shall organize a 
Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) for the purpose of providing a forum 
for the discussion of issues and their solutions related to the total 
school program and to ensure the full cooperation of parents in the 
efficient implementation of such program. 


 
Every PTA shall provide mechanisms to ensure proper coordination with the members of the community
,
 provide an avenue for discussing relevant concerns and provide 
assistance and support to the school for the promotion of their common 
interest. Standing committees may be created within the PTA organization
 to coordinate with community members. Regular fora may be conducted 
with local government units, civic organizations and other stakeholders 
to foster unity and cooperation. x x x




 Republic Act No. 8980 does mention PTCAs, but this is only in 
the specific context of the National Early Childhood Care and 
Development (ECCD) System. The ECCD System "refers to the full range of .
 . . programs that provide for the basic holistic needs of young 
children 
from birth to age six (6)
." It is not even an 
education program and does not involve the age range of students â 
elementary to high school â that is relevant to the Department Order. In
 any case, an isolated and passing mention does not equate to a mandate.
 


 Petitioner's invocation of Republic Act Nos. 9155 and 8980 only 
serve to muddle the issues by entreating considerations that are 
irrelevant to the purposes of the statute (
i.e
., the Child and Youth Welfare Code) that actually pertains to and requires the organization of PTAs. 


 From the previously quoted provisions of the Child and Youth 
Welfare Code and the Education Act of 1982, the purposes for which the 
organization of PTAs is mandated are clear. First, a PTA is to be a 
forum for discussion. Second, a PTA exists to ensure the full 
cooperation of parents in the implementation of school programs. The 
assailed Department Order serves these purposes. 


 By ensuring fiscal transparency and accountability, and by 
providing the basic framework for organization and official recognition,
 the Department Order ensures that PTAs exist and function in a manner 
that remains consistent with the articulated purposes of PTAs under the 
Child and Youth Welfare Code and the Education Act of 1982. A framework 
for organization ensures that PTAs are properly organized and are both 
adequately representative of and limited only to those interests that 
are appropriate to the education of children in elementary and high 
school. Measures for fiscal transparency and accountability ensure that 
PTAs are not hampered by pecuniary or proprietary interests that have 
nothing to do with the effective implementation of school programs. 
Finally, mechanisms for official recognition ensure that only those 
associations that organize and conduct themselves in a manner that is 
consistent with these purposes are privileged with state sanction.

 From petitioners' own submissions in their Memorandum, they list 
the requisites for valid administrative rules and regulations: 
  


 (1)	Their promulgation must be authorized by the Legislature; 


 (2)	They must be within the scope of the authority given by the Legislature; 


 (3)	They must be promulgated	in accordance	with the prescribed procedure; and


 (4)	They must be reasonable.
[16]
 




 While petitioners have demonstrated their compliance with 
requisites 1, 3 and 4, they failed however to substantiate their 
arguments anent the second requisite â that Article III of the FDA IRR 
is within the scope of RA 9711. Petitioners merely re-stated the policy 
for enactment of the law and the scope of the functions of the FDA 
without linking it to the exact provision in RA 9711 stating that 
tobacco products are health products. 
 The dearth of petitioners'
 argument on this score is further highlighted by their perfunctory 
discussion on delegated legislative power. From there petitioners drew 
conclusions of law that the FDA Act is complete in all its terms and 
with adequate guidelines, ultimately leaving only their enforcement by 
the appropriate authorities. 
 Petitioners concluded, thus: 
  


 In the case at bar, the subject IRR was issued within the limits
 of the authority conferred by law. The provisions of the IRR did not 
supplant the Constitution, the enabling law and other existing laws.
[17]




 On the whole, I cannot abide by petitioners' determination that 
tobacco products are health products by the mere expedient of relying on
 the second sentence of the amended Section 10(ff) of RA 3720 which 
provides that any sort of product, goods, and merchandise that has an 
effect on health are considered health products. As correctly ruled by 
the Regional Trial Court, and as I shall hereafter discuss, Section 25 
of RA 9711 clearly excludes tobacco products from the regulatory 
jurisdiction of the FDA. 
 
Third
. Regulations are not supposed to be a substitute for the general policymaking that Congress enacts in the form of a public law.
[18]

 In this regard, petitioners' claim that RA 9711 is a police power 
measure does not bear on the validity of Article III of the FDA IRR 
classifying tobacco products as health products. 
 In 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) v. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc
.,
[19]

 the Court delved into the nature of police power as inherent in the 
Legislative branch endowed with plenary power to make, amend, and repeal
 laws. Such power can be exercised only by Congress or upon a valid 
delegation of legislative power to the President and administrative 
boards. We thus held that based on its enabling law, the MMDA does not 
exercise police power and cannot enact rules ordering the opening of a 
private road within a private subdivision: 
  


 Police power is an inherent attribute of sovereignty. It has 
been defined as the power vested by the Constitution in the legislature 
to make, ordain, and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable 
laws, statutes and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not 
repugnant to the Constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good 
and welfare of the commonwealth, and for the subjects of the same. The 
power is plenary and its scope is vast and pervasive, reaching and 
justifying measures for public health, public safety, public morals, and
 the general welfare. 


 It bears stressing that police power is lodged primarily in the 
National Legislature. It cannot be exercised by any group or body of 
individuals not possessing legislative power. The National Legislature, 
however, 
may delegate
 this power to the President and 
administrative boards as well as the lawmaking bodies of municipal 
corporations or local government units. Once delegated, the agents can 
exercise 
only
 such legislative powers as are conferred on them by the national lawmaking body.
[20]
 




 Thereafter, in a subsequent case, 
Metro Manila Development Authority v. Viron Transportation Co., Inc
.,
[21]

 the Court affirmed the well-settled principle that the power of 
administrative agencies to prescribe regulations to promote health, 
morals, education, good order or safety, and general welfare of the 
people must have legal basis, 
i.e
., tethered to the powers granted in its enabling law. 
  


 Respecting the President's authority to order the implementation
 of the Project in the exercise of the police power of the State, 
suffice it to stress that the powers vested in the DOTC Secretary to 
establish and administer comprehensive and integrated programs for 
transportation and communications and to issue orders, rules and 
regulations to implement such mandate (which, as previously discussed, 
may also be exercised by the President) have been so delegated for the 
good and welfare of the people. Hence, these powers partake of the 
nature of police power. 


 Police power is the plenary power vested in the legislature to 
make, ordain, and establish wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes and 
ordinances, not repugnant to the Constitution, for the good and welfare 
of the people. This power to prescribe regulations to promote the 
health, morals, education, good order or safety, and general welfare of 
the people flows from the recognition that 
salus populi est suprema lex
 â the welfare of the people is the supreme law. 


 While police power rests primarily with the legislature, such 
power may be delegated, as it is in fact increasingly being delegated. 
By virtue of a valid delegation, the power may be exercised by the 
President and administrative boards as well as by the lawmaking bodies 
of municipal corporations or local governments under an express 
delegation by the Local Government Code of 1991. 


 The authority of the President to order the implementation of 
the Project notwithstanding, the designation of the MMDA as the 
implementing agency for the Project may not be sustained. It is 
ultra vires
, there being no legal basis therefor. 


 
It bears stressing that under the provisions of E.O. No. 125,
 as amended, it is the DOTC, and not the MMDA, which is authorized to 
establish and implement a project such as the one subject of the cases 
at bar.
 Thus, the President, although authorized to establish or 
cause the implementation of the Project, must exercise the authority 
through the instrumentality of the DOTC which, by law, is the primary 
implementing and administrative entity in the promotion, development and
 regulation of networks of transportation, and the one so authorized to 
establish and implement a project such as the Project in question. 


 
By designating the MMDA as the implementing agency of the 
Project, the President clearly overstepped the limits of the authority 
conferred by law, rendering E.O. No. 179 
ultra vires
.
[22]
 (Citations omitted) 




 I relate the foregoing to what has been discussed that rule-making
 power is legislative in character and can only be exercised by 
administrative officials and bodies only upon a statutory delegation of 
legislative power. Plainly, administrative agencies do not have inherent
 legislative power, more so police power. In their exercise of a validly
 delegated rule-making power, these bodies must toe the line under the 
aegis of their enabling law. That administrative bodies may only 
exercise such legislative powers as are conferred upon them should 
therefore brook no further argument. 
 Considering thus the 
emphasis made by petitioners on the harmful health effects of tobacco as
 against the range or scope of the subject matters that Congress may 
legislate on, if RA 9711 indeed contemplated (without articulation) that
 tobacco products be regulated by the FDA, then such a power ought to 
have been specifically carved out in the law. In reality, the regulation
 of tobacco products has been addressed in tobacco-specific legislation,
 in particular RA 9211 and RA 10643. 
 The public purpose of 
promotion and protection of public health harped on by petitioners, as 
well as our international obligation under the WHO FCTC, do not justify 
an all-encompassing grant of regulatory power over virtually any product
 determined by the FDA to have an effect on health. The delegation from 
Congress saw to placing guidelines in the implementation by petitioners 
of the FDA Act. 
 I draw a parallel in 
Office of the Solicitor General v. Ayala Land, Inc
.,
[23]
 which declared the IRR of the National Building Code as 
ultra vires
 for promulgating a rule imposing on shopping centers the obligation to provide free parking spaces for their patrons: 
  


 The explicit directive of the afore-quoted statutory and 
regulatory provisions, garnered from a plain reading thereof, is that 
respondents, as operators/lessors of neighborhood shopping centers, 
should provide parking and loading 1spaces, in accordance with the 
minimum ratio of one slot per 100 square meters of shopping floor area. 
There
 is nothing therein pertaining to the collection (or non-collection) of 
parking fees by respondents. In fact, the term "parking fees" cannot 
even be found at all in the entire National Building Code and its IRR. 


 Statutory construction has it that if a statute is clear and 
unequivocal, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without 
any attempt at interpretation. Since Section 803 of the National 
Building Code and Rule XIX of its IRR do not mention parking fees, then 
simply, said provisions do not regulate the collection of the same. x x x


 x x x x


 Hence, in order to bring the matter of parking fees within the 
ambit of the National Building Code and its IRR, the OSG had to resort 
to specious and feeble argumentation, in which the Court cannot concur. 


 The OSG cannot rely on Section 102 of the National Building Code
 to expand the coverage of Section 803 of the same Code and Rule XIX of 
the IRR, so as to include the regulation of parking fees. The OSG limits
 its citation to the first part of Section 102 of the National Building 
Code declaring the policy of the State "to safeguard life, health, 
property, and public welfare, consistent with the principles of sound 
environmental management and control"; but totally ignores the second 
part of said provision, which reads, "and to this end, make it the 
purpose of this Code to provide for all buildings and structures, a 
framework of minimum standards and requirements to regulate and control 
their location, site, design, quality of materials, construction, use, 
occupancy, and maintenance". While the first part of Section 102 of the 
National Building Code lays down the State policy, it is the second part
 thereof that explains how said policy shall be carried out in the Code.
 
Section 102 of the National Building Code is not an all-encompassing
 grant of regulatory power to the DPWH Secretary and local building 
officials in the name of life, health, property, and public welfare. On 
the contrary, it limits the regulatory power of said officials to 
ensuring that the minimum standards and requirements for all buildings 
and structures, as set forth in the National Building Code, are complied
 with.
 


 
Consequently, the OSG cannot claim that in addition to fixing
 the minimum requirements for parking spaces for buildings, Rule XIX of 
the IRR also mandates that such parking spaces be provided by building 
owners free of charge. If Rule XIX is not covered by the enabling law, 
then it cannot be added to or included in the implementing rules. The 
rule-making power of administrative agencies must be confined to details
 for regulating the mode or proceedings to carry into effect the law as 
it has been enacted, and it cannot be extended to amend or expand the 
statutory requirements or to embrace matters not covered by the statute.
 Administrative regulations must always be in harmony with the 
provisions of the law because any resulting discrepancy between the two 
will always be resolved in favor of the basic law.
[24]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted). 




 As in this case, there is nothing in RA 9711 which grants the FDA,
 in the guise of protecting public health, an all-encompassing grant of 
regulatory power over tobacco products because of its specific harmful 
health effects. 
 Section 2, Article III, Book II of the FDA IRR reads: 
  


 SECTION 2. 
Tobacco
. - The DOH, tasked with protecting the
 public's health against the injurious effects arising from the use of 
tobacco and tobacco products, has the responsibility of regulating 
tobacco and tobacco products through the FDA. 




 Ultimately, the grant of rule-making power is not a grant of 
unbridled discretion to the petitioners to regulate tobacco products. 
The determination of what constitutes health products not tethered to 
the exclusion of coverage found in Section 25 of RA 9711 is an exercise 
of unbridled discretion. 
 
Tobacco Products are not Health Products
 "Health products" is defined under Section 10(ff) of RA 3720 as amended by RA 9711 as follows: 
  


 (ff) 'Health products' means food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, 
biologicals, vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and household/urban 
hazardous substances and/or a combination of and/or a derivative 
thereof. It shall also refer to products that may have an effect on 
health which require regulations as determined by the FDA. 




 The foregoing definition laid down by Congress is one such 
standard and guideline in the delegation of power to prevent the 
delegate from running riot and exercising unbridled discretion. Another 
legislative guideline is the contentious Section 25 and specific 
provisions of special laws. 
 The succeeding sentence of RA 9711 
is qualified by the enumeration in the preceding sentence which, though 
these may have a negative effect on health, have a claimed therapeutic 
benefit which outweighs the negative effects. Thus, the power of the FDA
 to determine what are health products should be construed through the 
prism of 
ejusdem generis
[25]
 in accordance with the first sentence enumerating what are health products. 

 The layman's definition of "health products" is consistent with the 
FDA's vast expanse of powers. It is a compound word composed of an 
attributive noun "health" that qualifies the second word "products." 
Used as an adjective, "health" means "of, relating to, or conducive to 
health."
[26]
 Thus, it refers 
to products which claim to have a beneficial or therapeutic effect on 
health but do not fall within the enumeration in the first sentence of 
the amended Section 10(ff) of RA 3720. Health supplements logically fall
 under this category. 
 The argument of petitioners and Senators 
Franklin "Frank" M. Drilon (Senator Drilon) and Pilar Juliana "Pia" S. 
Cayetano (Senator Cayetano) that soft drinks, which likewise have no 
therapeutic effect, but are still regulated by the FDA, easily falls by 
the wayside. The very nomenclature "soft drinks" connotes a beverage and
 falls within the meaning of "food" specified in RA 9711.
[27]
 As a drink for man, "soft drinks" are specifically regulated by the FDA. 

 The definition that I accord here with regard to health products and my
 conclusion that these do not include tobacco products is stacked 
against the primary power and function of the FDA to ensure the safety 
of health products available to the public. If tobacco products were to 
be regulated by the FDA, such would contradict the regulatory scheme 
conferred upon it by law. 
 The objectives of the FDA Act are 
consistent with its conferment of general powers to regulate 
establishments and products under its jurisdiction.
[28]

 These are not the sole provisions to which the FDA IRR must adhere to. 
All the provisions thereof, including Article III on Tobacco and Other 
Products, must be anchored and clearly refracted from the law. 
 
Demonstrably, the powers of the FDA call for the removal of health 
products which are found to have harmful health effects. The definition 
under the law to which petitioners anchor their regulation of tobacco 
productsâ the harmful health effectsâis their very objection to the 
same. 
 Section 4 of RA 3720 as amended by RA 9711 enumerates the functions, powers and duties of the enhanced and strengthened FDA: 
  


 SEC. 4. To carry out the provisions of this Act, there is hereby
 created an office to be called the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
in the Department of Health (DOH). Said Administration shall be under 
the Office of the Secretary and shall have the following functions, 
powers and duties: 


 x x x x


 (i) To require all manufacturers, traders, distributors, 
importers, exporters, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, and 
non-consumer users of health products to report to the FDA any incident 
that reasonably indicates that said product has caused or contributed to
 the death, serious illness or serious injury to a consumer, a patient, 
or any person; 


 (j) To issue cease and desist orders 
motu propio
 or upon verified complaint for health products, whether or not registered with the FDA: 
Provided
,
 That for registered health products, the cease and desist order is 
valid for thirty (30) days and may be extended for sixty (60) days only 
after due process has been observed; 


 (k)	After due process, to order the ban, recall, and/or 
withdrawal of any health product found to have caused the death, serious
 illness or serious injury to a consumer or patient, or is found to be 
imminently injurious, unsafe, dangerous, or grossly deceptive, and to 
require all concerned to implement the risk management plan which is a 
requirement for the issuance of the appropriate authorization; 


 (l)	To strengthen the post market surveillance system in 
monitoring health products as defined in this Act and incidents of 
adverse events involving such products[.]




 Ineluctably, following the FDA's conferred powers and its 
determination of what are health products, petitioners will be 
hard-pressed to retain tobacco products in the market. 
 Further, pursuant to its powers, the FDA issued Circular No. 2016-012
[29]
 providing the 
Guidelines on Product Recall 
 addressed to "
All Licensed Establishments of Health Products and Other Concerned Stakeholders
." 

 The Rationale and the Scope of FDA Circular No. 2016-012 reveal the 
scope and power of the FDA over health products that are proven unsafe 
or hazardous as what petitioners claim tobacco products to be: 
  


 1. 
Rationale


 Republic Act No. 3720, also known as the "Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act", as amended, and Republic Act No. 9711, also known as the 
"Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Act of 2009" and its Implementing 
Rules and Regulations were all enacted to establish an effective 
regulatory system for the authorization, registration, and monitoring of
 health products. 


 Section 5 (i) of Republic Act No. 9711 mandated the FDA to 
require all manufacturers, traders, distributors, importers, exporters, 
wholesalers, retailers, consumers and non-consumer users of health 
products to report to the FDA any incident that reasonably indicates 
that a product has caused or contributed to the death, serious illness 
or serious injury to a consumer, a patient, or any person. Moreover, 
Section 5 (k) of the same law empowers the FDA, after due process, to 
order the ban, recall, and/or withdrawal of any health product found to 
have caused the death, serious illness or serious injury to a consumer 
or patient, or is found to be imminently injurious, unsafe, dangerous, 
or grossly deceptive, and to require all concerned to implement the risk
 management plan which is a requirement for the issuance of the 
appropriate authorization. 


 Recall is the method of withdrawing or correcting unsafe or 
hazardous health products from the distribution chain that may present a
 health hazard to the consumer or user. It is an action taken by 
establishments involved in the supply chain (
e.g
., manufacturers,
 distributors, or retailers) as (1) part of their responsibility to 
protect the public health and well-being, (2) compliance to the 
appropriate good practices (
e.g
., good manufacturing, distribution, or storage practices), and (3) compliance to existing standards and regulations. 


 x x x x


 3.	
Scope


 This FDA Circular shall apply to all licensed manufacturers, 
traders, distributors (importers, exporters, and wholesalers), and 
retailers of health products. 




 Thus, within the envisioned regulatory system of the FDA over 
health products, the regulation of tobacco products is equivalent to a 
prohibition because of petitioners' submission that these are hazardous.
 Applying RA 9711, the FDA IRR, and FDA Circular No. 2016-012 to tobacco
 products, the FDA would have nothing more to regulate since tobacco 
products 
per se
 would be banned, recalled, and or withdrawn from the market. 
 Lastly, it must be noted that tobacco-specific legislation
[30]
 explicitly granted regulation of tobacco products, not its prohibition, ban, recall or withdrawal.
[31]
 On the other hand, the power to "regulate" means the power to protect, foster, promote, preserve and control.
[32]






ARTICLE III is inconsistent with Tobacco-Specific Legislation.
 






Article III, Book II of the FDA IRR is contrary to the statutes which specifically refer to the regulation of tobacco products. 
  
 
First
. Section 25 of RA 9711 provides: 
  


 SECTION 25. 
Coverage
. - This Act shall govern all health products: 
Provided
, 
That
 nothing in this Act shall be deemed to modify the sole and exclusive 
jurisdiction of other specialized agencies and special laws only insofar
 as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws, including, 
but not limited to, those covered by Republic Act No. 9211, Executive 
Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468.
 
(Emphasis supplied) 




 Section 25 is clear as to the jurisdiction of the FDA over all 
health products. To recall, Section 9 thereof which amended Section 
10(ff) of RA 3720 defines "health products." While using the word "all" 
to span the entire gamut of health products, Section 25 unmistakably 
contains a proviso which on its face limits the expansive grant of 
powerâthe regulation of all health products. Certainly, if tobacco 
products are not health products and excluded from the coverage of RA 
9711, then it cannot be regulated by the FDA. 
 
Lim v. Gamosa
[33]

 is instructive on the language used to determine the scope of the 
bestowal of jurisdiction. While the subject matter in this case involved
 the exercise of 
quasi-judicial
 power by the National Commission 
on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), the exercise thereof must still be derived
 from the enabling law: 
  


 Jurisdiction	is	the	power	and	authority, conferred	by the 
Constitution and by statute, to hear and decide a case. The authority to
 decide a cause at all is what makes up jurisdiction. 


 Section 66 of the IPRA, the law conferring jurisdiction on the NCIP, reads: 




 Sec. 66. 
Jurisdiction of the NCIP
. â 
The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs:
 Provided, however, 
That
  no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have 
exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws
. For this
 purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of 
Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute 
that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a 
condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. x x x




 The conferment of such jurisdiction is consistent with state 
policy averred in the IPRA which recognizes and promotes all the rights 
of ICCs/IPs within the framework of the constitution. Such is likewise 
reflected in the mandate of the NCIP to "protect and promote the 
interest and wellbeing of the ICCs/IPs with due regard to their beliefs,
 customs, traditions and[,] institutions." 


 In connection thereto, from 
Bank of Commerce v. Planters Development Bank
, 
we
 learned that the provisions of the enabling statute are the yardsticks 
by which the Court would measure the quantum of quasiÂ­ judicial powers 
an administrative agency may exercise, as defined in the enabling act of
 such agency.
 


 Plainly, the NCIP is the "primary government agency responsible 
for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs 
to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the ICCs/IPs and the
 recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights 
thereto." Nonetheless, the creation of such government agency does not 
per se

 grant it primary and/or exclusive and original jurisdiction, excluding 
the regular courts from taking cognizance and exercising jurisdiction 
over cases which may involve rights of ICCs/IPs. 


 Recently, in 
Unduran, et al. v. Aberasturi, et al.
, we 
ruled that Section 66 of the IPRA does not endow the NCIP with primary 
and/or exclusive and original jurisdiction over all claims and disputes 
involving rights of ICCs/IPs. Based on the qualifying proviso, we held 
that the NCIP's jurisdiction over such claims and disputes occur only 
when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. 
Since two of the defendants therein were not IPs/ICCs, the regular 
courts had jurisdiction over the complaint in that case. 


 In his concurring opinion in 
Unduran
, Justice Jose P. 
Perez submits that the jurisdiction of the NCIP ought to be definitively
 drawn to settle doubts that still linger due to the implicit 
affirmation done in
 The City Government of Baguio City, et al. v. Atty. Masweng, et al
. of the NCIP's jurisdiction over cases where one of the parties are not ICCs/IPs. 


 In 
Unduran
 and as in this case, 
we are hard[-]pressed 
to declare a primary and/or exclusive and original grant of jurisdiction
 to the NCIP over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs 
where there is no clear intendment by the legislature.
 


 
Significantly, the language of Section 66 is only clear on 
the nature of the claim and dispute as involving rights of ICCs/IPs, but
 ambiguous and indefinite in other respects. While using the word "all" 
to quantify the number of the "claims and disputes" as covering each and
 every claim and dispute involving rights of ICCs/IPs, Section 66 
unmistakably contains a proviso, which on its face restrains or limits 
the initial generality of the grant of jurisdiction. 
(Emphasis supplied) 


 
Unduran
 lists the elements of the grant of jurisdiction to the NCIP: (1) the claim and dispute involve the right of ICCs/IPs; 
and

 (2) both parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their 
customary laws. Both elements must be present prior to the invocation 
and exercise of the NCIP's jurisdiction. 


 Thus, despite the language that the NCIP shall have jurisdiction
 over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs, we cannot be
 confined to that first alone and therefrom deduce primary sole NCIP 
jurisdiction over all ICCs/IPs claims and disputes 
to the exclusion of the regular courts
.
 If it were the intention of the legislative that: (1) the NCIP exercise
 primary jurisdiction over, and/or (2) the regular courts be excluded 
from taking cognizance of, claims and disputes involving rights of 
ICCs/IPs, the legislature could have easily done so as in other 
instances conferring primary, and original and exclusive jurisdiction to
 a specific administrative body. x x x
[34]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 Patently, tobacco products are not health products because the 
proviso in Section 25 specifically excluded it from the jurisdiction of 
the FDA. 
 Still and all, petitioners insist that the proviso retained with the FDA the regulatory power over the 
health aspect

 of the already excluded products, to wit: "That nothing in this Act 
shall be deemed to modify the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of other 
specialized agencies and special laws 
only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws
,
 including, but not limited to, those covered by RA 9211, Executive 
Order No. 245, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 
1468."
[35]
 This is evidently not so. 
 There is nothing in the use of the phrase ''only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws"
[36]
 which delineated the FDA's retention of regulatory powers over the health aspect of certain products, 
e.g.
,
 tobacco (RA 9211 and EO 245), sugar (EO 18), and coconut (PD 1468). The
 intention to exclude tobacco products from regulation by the FDA is 
especially true since two agencies already oversee, administer and 
regulate it and the tobacco industry: (1) IAC-Tobacco, and (2) the 
National Tobacco Administration (NTA). 
  
 To emphasize, RA 9711 did not repeal the foregoing laws and 
executive orders. Moreover, under Section 33 of RA 9211, the NTA was 
accorded an additional mandate to implement various programs and 
projects.
[37]
 
 Notably,
 the special laws on the subject of tobacco regulation, RA 9211 and RA 
10643, both deal with the health aspect of, and define, tobacco 
products, to wit: 
  


 Republic Act No. 9211


 SECTION 4.	
Definition of Terms
. - As used in this Act: 


 x x x x


 s. "Tobacco Product"â refers to any product that consists of 
loose tobacco that contains nicotine and is intended for use in a 
cigarette, including any product containing tobacco and intended for 
smoking or oral or nasal use. Unless stated otherwise, the requirements 
of this Act pertaining to cigarettes shall also apply to other tobacco 
products[.]


 Republic Act No. 10643


 SECTION 4.	
Definition of Terms
. -


 x x x x


 (f) "
Tobacco Products
" means products entirely or partly 
made of leaf tobacco as raw material, which are manufactured to be used 
for smoking, sucking, chewing or snuffing, or by any means of 
consumption. 




 Verily, the hazardous effect of tobacco products is necessarily 
intertwined with its status as a key agricultural product in the 
Philippines. The policy to balance the health and economic aspects of 
tobacco products and the tobacco industry is reflected in Section 2 of 
RA 9211 aptly titled The Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003: 
  


 SECTION 2. 
Policy
. - It is the policy of the State to 
protect the populace from hazardous products and promote the right to 
health and instill health consciousness among them. It is also the 
policy of the State, consistent with the Constitutional ideal to promote
 the general welfare, to safeguard the interests of the workers and 
other stakeholders in the tobacco industry. For these purposes, the 
government shall institute a balanced policy whereby the use, sale and 
advertisements of tobacco products shall be regulated in order to 
promote a healthful environment and protect the citizens from the 
hazards of tobacco smoke, and at the same time ensure that the interests
 of tobacco farmers, growers, workers and stakeholders are not adversely
 compromised. 




 In short, the regulation of tobacco products is not solely a health concern. 

 Tobacco products have a dual aspect which tobacco-specific legislation 
has sought to balance; the wisdom behind the characterization and the 
balancing policy are within the exclusive realm of legislative 
discretion. Inquiry into the wisdom of laws is beyond the province of 
the Supreme Court.
[38]
 
The balancing policy and dual aspect of tobacco regulation are again 
reflected in the creation of the IAC-Tobacco as the implementing agency 
of the provisions of RA 9211. The IAC-Tobacco is composed of various 
cabinet secretaries in the executive department and is chaired by the 
Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, with the Secretary of
 the DOH as Vice-Chairperson.
[39]
 

 Moreover, Section 30 of RA 9211 militates against all the assertions of
 petitioners as it specifies the unqualified application of the TRA to 
all tobacco products: 
  


 SECTION 30. 
Application to Tobacco Products
. - The 
provisions of this Act shall apply to all tobacco products placed into 
commerce in the Philippines. Except as provided below, no provision of 
this Act shall apply to tobacco products intended or offered by the 
manufacturer for export and not for [retail] sale in the Philippines. 




 Recently, in 
Department of Health v. Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing, Inc
.
[40]

  we had occasion to affirm the regulatory power conferred upon the 
IAC-Tobacco by RA 9211 which effectively divested the DOH and the FDA of
 any authority to act upon applications for tobacco sales promotional 
permit. We declared, thus: 
  


 Furthermore, the declared policy of RA 9211 where "promotion" is
 defined includes the institution of "a balanced policy whereby the 
use, sale and advertisements

 of tobacco products shall be regulated in order to promote a healthful 
environment and protect the citizens from the hazards of tobacco smoke .
 . . ." Hence, if the IAC-Tobacco was created and expressly given the 
exclusive authority to implement the provisions of RA 9211 in accordance
 with the foregoing State policy, it signifies that it shall also take 
charge of the regulation of the use, sale, distribution, and 
advertisements of tobacco products, as well as all forms of "promotion" 
which essentially includes "sales promotion." 
Therefore, with this 
regulatory power conferred upon the IAC-Tobacco by RA 9211, the DOH and 
the BFAD have been effectively and impliedly divested of any authority 
to act upon applications for tobacco sales promotional permit, including
 PMPMI's.
 


 Finally, it must be stressed that RA 9211 is a special 
legislation which exclusively deals with the subject of tobacco products
 and related activities. On the other hand, RA 7394 is broader and more 
general in scope, and treats of the general welfare and interests of 
consumers 
vis-Ã -vis
 proper conduct for business and industry. As such, 
lex specialis derogat generali
.
 General legislation must give way to special legislation on the same 
subject, and generally is so interpreted as to embrace only cases in 
which the special provisions are not applicable. In other words, where 
two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, 
the one specially designed therefore should prevail. 


 In fine, the Court agrees with the CA that it is the IAC-Tobacco
 and not the DOH which has the primary jurisdiction to regulate sales 
promotion activities as explained in the foregoing discussion. As such, 
the DOH's ruling, including its construction of RA 9211 (
i.e
., that it 
completely
 banned tobacco advertisements, 
promotions
, and sponsorships, as 
promotion

 is inherent in both advertising and sponsorship), are declared null and
 void, which, as a necessary consequence, precludes the Court from 
further delving on the same. 
As it stands, the present applications 
filed by PMPMI are thus remanded to the IAC-Tobacco for its appropriate 
action. Notably, in the proper exercise of its rule-making authority, 
nothing precludes the IAC-Tobacco from designating any of its pilot 
agencies (which, for instance, may even be the DOH) to perform its 
multifarious functions under RA 9211.
[41]

 On the whole, Article III of the FDA IRR contradicts 
tobacco-specific legislation by expanding the scope of the definition of
 health products and appropriating FDA regulation of tobacco products. 

 Significantly, a similar question on the jurisdiction of the United 
States of America Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) to regulate 
tobacco products was brought before the United States Supreme Court in 
FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation
.
[42]

 In that case, the US Supreme Court considered the enabling law as a 
whole and found that the US Congress intended to exclude tobacco 
products from the US FDA's jurisdiction. The US Supreme Court noted the 
contradiction in the FDA's exercise of jurisdiction which would result 
in the complete removal of tobacco from the market. Any resulting ban 
would contradict the US Congress's clear intent as expressed in their 
tobacco-specific legislation. The US Supreme Court therefore concluded 
that there existed no room for tobacco products within the then 
prevailing US FDA Act. 
 Heeding the US Supreme Court's 
construction of the law and determining that the remedy laid with 
Congress to specifically legislate the FDA's regulatory jurisdiction 
over tobacco products, the US Congress enacted The Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) which was 
signed into law on June 22, 2009. The aforesaid law specifically 
provided for the US FDA's authority to regulate the manufacture, 
distribution, and marketing of tobacco products. 
 It bears further repeating that tobacco products are covered by RA 9211 with short title "
Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003
"
 which same law is referred to by RA 9711, the FDA Act of 2009, in 
Section 25. That the right to health is constitutionally enshrined does 
not grant the FDA unbridled authority to exercise its power beyond the 
provisions of the empowering statute. 
 In all, the delegated 
rule-making power of administrative agencies ought to be exercised 
within the confines of the Constitution, the enabling statute, and other
 laws, such as tobacco-specific legislation. Consequently, the foregoing
 alleged violations in the FDA's exercise of administrative rule-making 
power calls to the fore our own power and duty that is judicial review.
[43]


 That there is an actual case or controversy is further 
emphasized by the opposing pleadings in intervention of legislators of 
RA 971â Senator Drilon and Senator Cayetano as 
Petitioners-In-Intervention and Congressman Edcel C. Lagman as 
Respondent-in-Intervention. Indeed, the crafters of our laws have 
opposing views on the the scope of FDA's regulatory jurisdiction and on 
the other laws covering the specific subject-matter of tobacco. 
  
 There are instances when this Court exercised the power of judicial review in cases involving newly-enacted laws. 
 In 
Pimentel, Jr. v. Aguirre
,
[44]

 this Court fixed the point at which a legal issue matures into an 
actual case or controversyâat the pre-occurrence of an "overt act":
  


 In the unanimous en banc case 
TaÃ±ada v. Angara
, this 
Court held that when an act of the legislative department is seriously 
alleged to have infringed the Constitution, settling the controversy 
becomes the duty of this Court. By the mere enactment of the questioned 
law or the approval of the challenged action, the dispute is said to 
have ripened into a judicial controversy even without any other overt 
act. Indeed, even a singular violation of the Constitution and/or the 
law is enough to awaken judicial duty. Said the Court: 




 "In seeking to nullify an act of the Philippine Senate on the 
ground that it contravenes the Constitution, the petition no doubt 
raises a justiciable controversy. Where an action of the legislative 
branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it 
becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to 
settle the dispute. . . .The duty (to adjudicate) remains to assure that
 the supremacy of the Constitution is upheld.' Once a 'controversy as to
 the application or interpretation of a constitutional provision is 
raised before this Court . . ., it becomes a legal issue which the Court
 is bound by constitutional mandate to decide. '


 x x x x


 "As this Court has repeatedly and firmly emphasized in many 
cases, it will not shirk, digress from or abandon its sacred duty and 
authority to uphold the Constitution in matters that involve grave abuse
 of discretion brought before it in appropriate cases, committed by any 
officer, agency, instrumentality or department of the government." 




 In the same vein, the Court also held in Tatad v. Secretary of the Department of Energy: 




 ". . . Judicial power includes not only the duty of the courts
 to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally 
demandable and enforceable, but also the duty to determine whether or 
not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess
 of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of 
government. The courts, as guardians of the Constitution, have the 
inherent authority to determine whether a statute enacted by the 
legislature transcends the limit imposed by the fundamental law. Where 
the statute violates the Constitution, it is not only the right but the 
duty of the judiciary to declare such act unconstitutional and void." 




 By the same token, when an act of the President, who in our 
constitutional scheme is a coequal of Congress, is seriously alleged to 
have infringed the Constitution and the laws, as in the present case, 
settling the dispute becomes the duty and the responsibility of the 
courts.

 Thus, in 
Province of North Cotabato v. Government of the Republic of the Philippines Peace Panel on Ancestral Domain
,
[46]
 this Court stated: "[t]hat the law or act in question is not yet effective does not negate ripeness."
[47]
 
 Subsequently, this Court, in 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council
[48]
 stated: 
  


 The Court is not unaware that a reasonable certainty of the 
occurrence of a perceived threat to any constitutional interest suffices
 to provide a basis for mounting a constitutional challenge. This, 
however, is qualified by the requirement that there must be sufficient 
facts to enable the Court to intelligently adjudicate the issues.
[49]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 This Court's liberality in scrutinizing a petition for an actual case or controversy was more recently illustrated in 
Belgica v. Ochoa
[50]
 
(Belgica)
. In 
Belgica
, this Court found that there was an actual case or controversy: 
  


 The requirement of contrariety of legal rights is clearly 
satisfied by the antagonistic positions of the parties on the 
constitutionality of the "Pork Barrel System." Also, the questions in 
these consolidated cases are ripe for adjudication since the challenged 
funds and the provisions allowing for their utilization â such as the 
2013 GAA for the PDAF, PD 910 for the Malampaya Funds and PD 1869, as 
amended by PD 1993, for the Presidential Social Fund â are currently 
existing and operational; hence, there exists an immediate or threatened
 injury to petitioners as a result of the unconstitutional use of these 
public funds.
[51]
 




 
Belgica
 was followed by 
Araullo v. Aquino III
,
[52]
 where this Court stated: 
  


 An actual and justiciable controversy exists in these 
consolidated cases. The incompatibility of the perspectives of the 
parties on the constitutionality of the DAP and its relevant issuances 
satisfy the requirement for a conflict between legal rights. The issues 
being raised herein meet the requisite ripeness considering that the 
challenged executive acts were already being implemented by the DBM, and
 there are averments by the petitioners that such implementation was 
repugnant to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Moreover, the 
implementation of the DAP entailed the allocation and expenditure of 
huge sums of public funds. The fact that public funds have been 
allocated, disbursed or utilized by reason or on account of such 
challenged executive acts gave rise, therefore, to an actual controversy
 that is ripe for adjudication by the Court.
[53]
 




 In 
Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa
,
[54]
 this Court found that there was an actual case or controversy, despite the Petition being a facial challenge: 
  


 The OSG also assails the propriety of the facial challenge 
lodged by the subject petitions, contending that the RH Law cannot be 
challenged "on its face" as it is not a speech regulating measure. 


 The Court is not persuaded. 


 In United States (US) constitutional law, a facial challenge, 
also known as a First Amendment Challenge, is one that is launched to 
assail the validity of statutes concerning not only protected speech, 
but also all other rights in the First Amendment. These include 
religious freedom, freedom of the press, and the right of the people to 
peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of 
grievances. After all, the fundamental right to religious freedom, 
freedom of the press and peaceful assembly are but component rights of 
the right to one's freedom of expression, as they are modes which one's 
thoughts are externalized. 


 In this jurisdiction, the application of doctrines originating 
from the U.S. has been generally maintained, albeit with some 
modifications. While this Court has withheld the application of facial 
challenges to strictly penal statutes, it has expanded its scope to 
cover statutes not only regulating free speech, but also those involving
 religious freedom, and other fundamental rights. The underlying reason 
for this modification is simple. For unlike its counterpart in the U.S.,
 this Court, under its expanded jurisdiction, is mandated by the 
Fundamental Law not only to settle actual controversies involving rights
 which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also to determine 
whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to 
lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or 
instrumentality of the Government. Verily, the framers of Our 
Constitution envisioned a proactive Judiciary, ever vigilant with its 
duty to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution. 


 Consequently, considering that the foregoing petitions have 
seriously alleged that the constitutional human rights to life, speech 
and religion and other fundamental rights mentioned above have been 
violated by the assailed legislation, the Court has authority to take 
cognizance of these kindred petitions and to determine if the RH Law can
 indeed pass constitutional scrutiny. To dismiss these petitions on the 
simple expedient that there exist no actual case or controversy, would 
diminish this Court as a reactive branch of government, acting only when
 the Fundamental Law has been transgressed, to the detriment of the 
Filipino people.[151] (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) 




 Our disposition in 
GIOS Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications
[55]
 
(GIOS Samar)
 is quite telling of our holdings on the existence of an actual case or controversy. 
 In 
GIOS Samar
, we amplified on the doctrine of hierarchy of courts which had long been recognized in our jurisdiction.
[56]

 The petitioner therein questioned the constitutionality of the bundling
 of various Airport Projects instituted during the time of President 
Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III. In dismissing the case, the Court found 
that while the issues alleged by petitioner GIOS Samar are ostensibly 
constitutional and legal, the main issue on the bundling of the Airport 
Projects are inextricably intertwined with underlying questions of fact.
 From there, the Court proceeded to trace the history of the doctrine of
 hierarchy of courts and one by one dismissed the assertions of 
petitioner GIOS Samar as factual questions properly cognizable by the 
lower courts, specifically the Regional Trial Courts. 
 However, note that the constitutionality of the bundling of the Airport Projects is not the
 lis mota
 of the case. At the time of the disposition of 
GIOS Samar

 in 2019, and as early as November 14, 2016, the National Economic 
Development Authority (NEDA) Board approved the unbundling of the 
regional airport projects. On January 24, 2017 the DOTr published an 
advertisement inviting new players to participate in the bidding of the 
airport projects.
[57]
 
 
Plainly, there was no longer any bundled Airport Projects to speak of 
and thus the case could have been dismissed for mootness. Yet, the Court
 proceeded to rule on the substantive issue of the allegations in the 
petition and ruled that the Court is not a trier of facts.
 
Moreover, the Court saw no need to discuss the necessity to establish 
injury or threat of injury by GIOS Samar as a result of the bundling of 
the Airport Projects. Evident from the facts in 
GIOS Samar
 is the
 lack of establishment of supposed substantial injury to "a 
non-governmental organization composed of subsistence farmers and 
fisherfolk from Samar, who are among the victims of Typhoon Yolanda 
relying on government assistance for the rehabilitation of their 
industry and livelihood"
[58]
 by virtue of the bundling of the Airport Projects.

 Although we have previously ruled that "in order for an association to 
have legal standing, it must establish the identity of its members, and 
present proof of its authority to bring the suit for and on behalf of 
its members,"
[59]
 in 
GIOS
 Samar, we ruled on the petitions given the import of emphasizing the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. 

 In contrast, and as we have already laid out throughout our discussion 
of this case, there is an actual case or controversy which properly 
calls for the Court's exercise of its inherent power of judicial review.
[60]
 
 The 
ponencia

 focuses on the known harmful health effects of tobacco which squarely 
falls within the definition of health products and in turn, within the 
FDA's competence and mandate "to ensure the safety and quality of health
 products." It holds that any other contrary reading would be illogical â
 
in that
â the FDA can regulate cosmetics due to its effects on health but not tobacco products. 

 I disagree. "Cosmetics" are specifically defined in the FDA actsâ 
Section 10 (h) of RA 3720, as amended by RA 9711. Section 9 of RA 9711 
provides: 
  


 SECTION 9. Section 10, subsections (a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i),
 (q), (r), (v), and (w) of Republic Act No. 3720, as amended, are hereby
 further amended, and new subsections (x), (y), (z), (aa), (bb), (cc), 
(dd), (ee), (ff), (gg), (hh), (ii), (jj), (kk), (ll), and (mm) are 
hereby added to read as follows: 


 "SEC. 10. For the purposes of this Act, the term: 


 "(h) 'Cosmetics' means any substance or preparation intended to 
be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body 
or with the teeth and the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, with a 
view exclusively or mainly to cleaning them, perfuming them, changing 
their appearance and/or correcting body odor, and/or protecting the body
 or keeping them in good condition. 




 Cosmetics are included within the FDA's regulatory jurisdiction because the FDA Act provides so. 

 The FDA's mandate and its heightened powers over health products is not
 assailed or questioned. The harmful health effects of tobacco are 
conceded. In fact, Section 2 of RA 9211, the Tobacco Regulation Act, 
declares the legal policy on tobacco, thus: 
  


 SECTION 2. Policy. â It is the policy of the State to protect 
the populace from hazardous products and promote the right to health and
 instill health consciousness among them. It is also the policy of the 
State, consistent with the Constitutional ideal to promote the general 
welfare, to safeguard the interests of the workers and other 
stakeholders in the tobacco industry. 
For these purposes, the 
government shall institute a balanced policy whereby the use, sale and 
advertisements of tobacco products shall be regulated in order to 
promote a healthful environment and protect the citizens from the 
hazards of tobacco smoke, and at the same time ensure that the interests
 of tobacco farmers, growers, workers and stakeholders are not adversely
 compromised.
 (emphasis ours) 




 In my disposition herein, I am expectedly constrained by what the 
prevailing laws provide, both RA 9711, and tobacco-specific legislation,
 RA 9211. I cannot immediately discount that tobacco is an agricultural 
product of economic interest to different stakeholders such as tobacco 
farmers, growers, workers and stakeholders and thereby ignore a specific
 law thereon. 
  
 Undeniably, from legislation, tobacco is an agricultural product used in trade in the Philippines, to wit: 
  


 SECTION 4. Definition of Terms. â As	used in this Act: 


 r. "Tobacco" â refers to agricultural components derived from 
the tobacco plant, which are processed for use in the manufacturing of 
cigarettes and other tobacco products; 


 s. "Tobacco Product" â refers to any product that consists of 
loose tobacco that contains nicotine and is intended for use in a 
cigarette, including any product containing tobacco and intended for 
smoking or oral or nasal use. Unless stated otherwise, the requirements 
of this Act pertaining to cigarettes shall also apply to other tobacco 
products; 




 We cannot simply apply the FDA Act, or RA 9711, to tobacco as a health product without considering the TRA, or RA 9211. In 
People v. Ejercito
,
[61]
 citing 
Teves v. Sandiganbayan
,
[62]

 we emphasized the rules of statutory construction that different 
statutes intersecting on the same subject matter should first be 
harmonized but in case of conflict, the statute dealing in detail with 
the subject matter, as opposed to the statute dealing with the subject 
in general terms, should prevail: 
  


 It is a rule of statutory construction that where one statute 
deals with a subject in general terms, and another deals with a part of 
the same subject in a more detailed way, the two should be harmonized if
 possible; but if there is any conflict, the latter shall prevail 
regardless of whether it was passed prior to the general statute. Or 
where two statutes are of contrary tenor or of different dates but are 
of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one designed 
therefor specially should prevail over the other.
[63]




 In this instance, the TRA, and its particular provisions on 
tobacco against the backdrop of a "Healthful Environment, Access 
restrictions, Advertising and Promotions, Implementing Agency and 
Application, Penal Provisions, Programs and Projects, Information 
Program and Miscellaneous Provisions" is patently the applicable law in 
the characterization of tobacco and tobacco products. 
 In addition, other aspects of tobacco regulation have been addressed in tobacco-specific regulation as Republic Act No. 10643
[64]
 in compliance with our international obligations under the WHO FCTC. Section 2 of RA 10643 explicitly provides:
  


 SECTION 2. Declaration of Principles. â The State shall protect 
and promote the right to health of the people and instill health 
consciousness among them. 


 The State shall protect consumers from trade malpractices and from substandard tobacco products. 


 The State accepts that, as a State-Party to the World Health 
Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a treaty 
that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standards of 
health, the Philippines is obliged to inform every person of the health 
consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke; to 
enact effective measures to curb and reduce tobacco use, especially 
among the youth; and to protect public health policy from the commercial
 and vested interests of the tobacco industry. 


 The State is cognizant of the Philippines' duty under Article 11
 of the FCTC which is to adopt and implement by September 2008 effective
 health warnings on tobacco products that should describe the harmful 
effects of tobacco use. 


 The State recognizes that based on empirical data, text warnings
 have been shown to be insufficient in conveying the dangers of tobacco 
products while Graphic Health Warnings have been shown to be more 
effective in conveying the truth about the dangers of exposure and 
consumption of tobacco smoke. 




 Significantly, the construction that tobacco products are health 
products is not inconsistent with our international commitments since we
 remain compliant by virtue of tobacco-specific legislation such as RA 
10643. My opinion herein does not in any way dilute the heightened 
powers of the FDA granted in RA 9711 but is consistent with our state 
recognition and policy of the dual aspect of tobacco products involving 
both a health and economic aspect. 
 As for the submission that 
tobacco is a drug and cigarette is a device, suffice to state that the 
FDA itself in the assailed IRR considers tobacco as a health product 
falling within the scope of RA 9711. We cannot substitute our wisdom for
 that of legislators and administrative executors of the law. 
  
The ruling in the US case of 
FDA v Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation
,
[65]

 regardless of the lack of unanimity in the ruling by the members of the
 US Supreme Court, and the consequent enactment by the US Congress of 
The Tobacco Control Act of 2009, speak volumes on the issue at hand. 
Where there was no specific law providing for FDA regulation of tobacco 
products, the US Supreme Court constricted the US FDA's exercise of 
jurisdiction by construing that tobacco is 
not a health product
. 
Addressing the apparent lacunae, the US Congress enacted the law 
specifically providing for the US FDA's authority to regulate the 
manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products. 
  
 
 CONCLUSION 
 
 All
 told, I am hard-pressed to sustain petitioners' assertion that the FDA 
has authority to regulate tobacco products. The FDA IRR pertaining to 
tobacco products is contrary to the enabling law which failed to 
legislate for the FDA's regulation of tobacco products or confine it to 
the health aspect. As previously mapped out herein, Section 25 excluded a
 number of products, including tobacco, from the coverage of RA 9711. 
Lastly, Article III, Book II of the FDA IRR is contrary to other laws, 
i.e

 Supra note 42. 


 


SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION


 LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


 I concur in the erudite 
ponencia
 of Justice Marvic 
M.V.F. Leonen that tobacco and cigarettes are health products which are 
subject to regulation by the Department of Health (DOH) through the Food
 and Drugs Administration (FDA). But aside from that, I vote to dismiss 
the petition for declaratory relief of respondent Philippine Tobacco 
Institute (PTI) for lack of actual case or controversy.
 
There is no actual case or controversy
 The 
most apparent defect
 of this case is the 
absence of any allegation of injury
 or 
threat of injury
 to respondent PTI. Where there is 
no
 such allegation of injury or threat of injury, there would also be 
no actual case or controversy
,
[1]
 an 
element
 in obtaining judicial review.
[2]
 In the 
absence
 of both 
injury
 or 
threat of injury
 and an 
actual case or controversy
, this case is 
not ripe for adjudication
 and 
must be dismissed
.
[3]
 I am aware that this case was pursued as a petition for 
declaratory relief
. However, this action is 
not exempt
 from either the 
injury
 or 
threat of injury
 or the 
actual case or controversy
 requirements.
  
 
De Borja v. PUMALU-MV
[4]
 held:
  


 Petitioners call upon us to disregard procedural rules on 
account of the alleged novelty and transcendental importance of the 
issue involved here. However, the transcendental importance doctrine 
cannot remedy the procedural defects that plague this petition. In the 
words of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Reynato Puno, "no amount of 
exigency can make this Court exercise a power where it is not proper." 
A
 petition for declaratory relief, like any other court action, cannot 
prosper absent an actual controversy that is ripe for judicial 
determination. 


....


 We deny the petition. 


For a 
petition for declaratory relief to prosper
, it must be shown that (a) 
there is a justiciable controversy
,
 (b) the controversy is between persons whose interests are adverse, (c)
 the party seeking the relief has a legal interest in the controversy, 
and (d) 
the issue invoked is ripe for judicial determination
. We 
agree with the CA when it dismissed De Borja's petition for being 
premature as it lacks the first and fourth requisites. We hasten to add 
that the petition, in fact, lacks all four requisites. 


 First, we find that De Borja's 
petition does not present a justiciable controversy or the "ripening seeds" of one as to warrant a court's intervention
.
 A justiciable controversy is a definite and concrete dispute touching 
on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests, which 
may be resolved by a court of law through the application of a law. It 
must be appropriate or ripe for judicial determination, admitting of 
specific relief through a decree that is conclusive in character. It 
must not be conjectural or merely anticipatory, which only seeks for an 
opinion that advises what the law would be on a hypothetical state of 
facts. 


 In his five-page petition for declaratory relief, De Borja 
failed to provide factual allegations showing
 that his legal rights were the subject of an 
imminent or threatened violation that should be prevented
 by the declaratory relief sought. He 
simply went on to conclude that the construction or interpretation of the reckoning point
 of the 15-kilometer range of municipal waters under the 1998 Fisheries Code 
would affect his rights
 as he is "
now exposed to apprehensions and possible harassments
 that may be
 brought about by conflicting interpretations
 of the said statute x x x." As to 
how these apprehensions and harassments shall come about, De Borja did not elaborate
. Clearly, 
therefore, there is no actual or imminent threat to his rights
 which is ripe for judicial review....




 In 
Republic v. Roque
,
[5]
 the Court explained:
  


 A perusal of private respondents' 
petition for declaratory relief
 would show that they 
have failed to demonstrate how they are left to
 
sustain or are in immediate danger to sustain some direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the assailed provisions
 of RA 9372. Not far removed from the factual milieu in the Southern Hemisphere cases, private respondents
 only assert general
 interests as citizens, and taxpayers and 
infractions which the government could prospectively commit if the enforcement of the said law
 would remain untrammelled. As their petition would disclose, private respondents' 
fear of prosecution was solely based on remarks of certain government officials
 which were addressed to the general public. They, however, 
failed to show how these remarks tended towards any prosecutorial or governmental action geared towards the implementation
 of RA 9372 
against them
. In other words, 
there was no particular, real or imminent threat to any of them
.




 ....


 
The possibility of abuse in the implementation of RA 9372 
does not avail to take the present petitions out of the realm of the 
surreal and merely imagined.
 Such possibility is not peculiar to RA 9372 since 
the
 exercise of any power granted by law may be abused. Allegations of 
abuse must be anchored on real events before courts may step in
 to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable. 




 Thus, in the same light that the Court dismissed the SC 
petitions in the Southern Hemisphere cases on the basis of, among 
others, lack of actual justiciable controversy (or the ripening seeds of
 one), the RTC should have dismissed private respondents' 
petition for declaratory relief
 all the same. 




 Here, respondent does 
not
 allege 
any injury
 it has suffered or any 
threat of suffering such injury
 as a result of the action of the FDA to 
classify tobacco as a health product
 and
 issue Article III, Book II of the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 9711
 (
The Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009
). What respondent could only refer us to are 
apprehensions
 and 
speculations
 of 
harassments
 that may be brought about by the
 conflicting interpretations
 of the 
breadth of rule-making authority
 given to the FDA in light of the amendments to its charter, RA 3720
[6]
 (1963), by RA 9711.
[7]
 
 The 
importance
 of 
actual facts
 of 
injury
 or 
threats of injury
 cannot be overstated. This is because 
without
 such 
actual
 facts, the Court would in effect be 
rendering an opinion
 on a state of 
assumed
 and 
hypothetical facts
. Other countries like Canada, India, and Nauru allow such process through what they call 
reference
 petitions, but the Philippines and the United States have 
no authority
 to do so because of the requirement of an actual case or controversy. Hence, 
for this doctrinal reason
, it is my respectful stand that the Court ought to have called the attention of the courts below about this fatal defect and 
dismissed
 this case. 
 The 
absence of actual facts
 nesting the claim injury or threats of injury and actual case or controversy is 
critical
 for 
another
 reason â it 
deprives
 the Court of the 
exact boundaries
 of the 
relief
 to which respondent as then petitioner may perhaps be entitled and the 
obligations
 which petitioner now as respondent then must discharge or endure. The 
result
 of the our approach here is to 
establish
 an 
overbroad
 and 
over-encroaching binding doctrine
 â here, that the FDA has 
absolutely no jurisdiction over tobacco, period
. 
 This is a 
dangerous precedent
 because we provide here 
no context
 as to when this doctrine would or should kick in. The 
actual facts
 of the 
injury
 or 
threat of injury
 would have supplied that 
limiting
 context. 
 By the end of our discussion here, we are unfortunately 
left with
 the 
same issue
 that this case should have 
properly
 resolved 
had there been actual facts
 â in what instances would the FDA have 
jurisdiction over tobacco
 and in what instances would it have to 
give way
 to other agencies' jurisdictions per Section 25
[8]
 of RA 9711? 
 By 
delving
 and 
resolving
 this issue 
sans actual facts
, we might inappropriately 
adopt
 a 
policy decision
 as 
legally binding doctrine
 â I respectfully say a 
POLICY decision
 since we 
totally ease out here the FDA without
 providing 
specific relief
 to a 
specific injury or threat of injury
 to respondent.
 No doubt, I am crying for 
actual facts
 of injury or 
threat of injury
, and of 
actual case or controversy
. The reason is that the 
delineation of jurisdiction
 among the concerned administrative agencies, the FDA and the Inter-Agency-Tobacco Committee (under RA 9211
[9]
) included, is 
not all clear
 and 
brightly divided
 or 
apportioned
. There are 
gaps
 and 
omissions
 and 
obvious difference of opinions
 on the impact of these gaps and omissions, which 
would have been clarified
 by the 
actual injury
 or 
threat of injury
 that respondent allegedly suffered 
as a result
 of the issuance of the assailed FDA implementing rule. 
 Has the FDA interfered with the 
advertisement
 and 
packaging
 of and 
sponsorship
 by tobacco products? Has the FDA meddled in the 
identification
 of 
smoking areas
 or the 
employment
 of 
minors
 in the sale of tobacco products? Has the FDA regulated respondent's tobacco 
manufacturing
 or 
pre-sale
 activities and if yes in 
what aspects
? We 
do not
 and 
will never know
 because respondent 
posthaste
 filed the petition for declaratory relief 
just after
 the issuance of the assailed FDA implementing rule. 
 Indeed, had we 
required
 the statement of an actual case or controversy, inclusive of injury or threat of such injury, we would have 
clarified
 the 
boundaries
 of the relief we are giving to respondent. However, as things stand, we have 
decided
 to 
totally eliminate
 the FDA 
from anything
 about tobacco 
without the benefit
 of an 
actual case or controversy
 and 
without
 any 
injury
 or 
threat of injury
. Courts are not 
like Congress which
 does 
not
 deal with 
justiciable
 controversies and 
adjudicative
 facts but 
policy decisions
 arising from 
legislative
 or 
social
 facts involving 
multitudes
 of peoples.
[10]
 This is 
not the role
 of the courts since courts decide matters 
incrementally
 on a 
case-by-case
 basis. 

 In his Dissenting Opinion, my esteemed colleague Justice Caguioa 
insists that an actual case or controversy does not require overt acts 
showing a violation of one's rights. According to Justice Caguioa, 
"[t]he only necessary and undisputed fact in this case is the DOH's 
promulgation of the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 9711,
[11]

 which gives rise to an actual controversy susceptible of judicial 
resolution." Other than that, facts are not important in the case at 
bar. In support of his theory, Justice Caguioa invokes the Court's 
rulings in 
Samahan ng Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK) v. Quezon City
[12]
 and 
Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison v. De Lima
,
[13]
 which purportedly rejected the proposition that there should be concrete acts before the case becomes justiciable. 
 I respectfully disagree. 
 Facts are 
important
. Facts are needed for a 
contextualization of respondent's arguments using factual
 and 
evidentiary bases
. 
 The 
reason
 for the 
need for facts
 is Section 25 of RA 9711, 
Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009
: 
  


 SECTION 25. Coverage. â 
This Act shall govern all health products
: Provided, That 
nothing
 in this Act shall be 
deemed to modify
 the
 sole and exclusive jurisdiction
 of other specialized agencies and special laws 
only insofar as the acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws
, including, but not limited to, those covered by 
Republic Act No. 9211, Executive Order No. 245
, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468. (emphases and underscoring added) 




 Clearly, the FDA is 
not prohibited
 from exercising its jurisdiction over 
health products 
unless
 such exercise 
intrudes
 into 
acts covered by the respective charters of other tobacco agencies
. Hence, we 
need facts
 in this case to determine if the FDA has intruded into the other agencies' jurisdictions. 
 In other words, if respondent's 
only fact of interest
 is the 
passage of the DOH IRR
 confirming FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products, this is clearly 
insufficient
. We need 
more facts
 if indeed the 
FDA has intruded
 into the 
acts covered by these specialized agencies and laws
. This is 
because
 
not every act of jurisdiction
 of the 
FDA
 over 
tobacco products
 is ultra vires for being outside of the FDA's mandate and for being intrusive of other agencies' respective mandates. It 
depends on the acts of the FDA
 being complained of. It 
cannot just be
 because FDA has been 
confirmed by the DOH IRR to have some jurisdiction
 over tobacco and its devices. 
 Had Section 25 of RA 9711 been 
clear, categorical, and absolute
 that 
FDA had utterly no jurisdiction
 over 
tobacco
 and 
its devices
, the 
mere enactment
 of the 
DOH IRR
 giving FDA jurisdiction over tobacco and its devices 
would have been enough
 to establish an 
actual case or controversy
. This is 
because
 the 
mere enactment
 is the clear act or conduct that 
ripens
 the 
seeds
, if 
not
 already the 
seeds themselves
, of 
violation
 of another agency's right or mandate. 
 With all due respect to Justice Caguioa, his reliance on 
SPARK
 and 
Inmates
 is misplaced. For in these cases, 
there were clear and concrete acts
 which made the cases before the Court 
justiciable
, 
i.e
., the controversy was 
actual
 and 
ripe
 for adjudication. 
 In 
SPARK
, the Court explicitly noted that: 
  


 [f]ollowing the campaign of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to implement a nationwide curfew for minors, 
several
 local governments in Metro Manila started to strictly implement their 
curfew ordinances on minors through police operations
 which were publicly known as part of 'Oplan Rody.'... The case is likewise ripe for adjudication, considering that 
the Curfew Ordinances were being implemented
 until the Court issued the TRO enjoining their enforcement. 
The purported threat or incidence of injury is, therefore, not merely speculative or hypothetical but rather, real and apparent.
 (emphases and undersoring added) 




 Meanwhile, in 
Inmates
, the Court held that the mere fact of petitioners' 
incarceration
 and 
continued incarceration
 provided the actual case or controversy even 
sans
 the overt act
 of an 
actual denial
 of a good conduct time allowance (GCTA) application. This is because, as the Court expressly stressed, "
[w]ith
 the prisoners' continued incarceration, any delay in resolving the case
 would cause them great prejudice. Justice demands that they be released
 soonest, if not on time
. . . ." 
 Verily, neither 
SPARK
 nor 
Inmates

 supports Justice Caguioa's claim that the only fact necessary here is 
the issuance of the Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 9711. They do 
not serve as justification to entertain respondent's petition for 
declaratory relief. Without the necessary ripening of seeds, the trial 
court should have dismissed respondent's petition. 
 I rest my case on the Court's recent ruling in 
Manning Group Inc. v. Social Security System
[14]
 penned by Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo and concurred in by Justice Caguioa, among others, no less. thus:
  


 An actual case or controversy means an existing case or 
controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not 
conjectural or anticipatory, lest the decision of the court would amount
 to an advisory opinion. 
The rule is that courts do not sit to 
adjudicate mere academic questions to satisfy scholarly interest, 
however intellectually challenging.
 The controversy must be 
justiciable â definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of 
parties having adverse legal interests. In other words, the pleadings 
must show an active antagonistic assertion of a legal right, on the one 
hand, and a denial thereof, on the other; 
that is, it must concern a real, tangible and not merely a theoretical question or issue.

 There ought to be an actual and substantial controversy admitting of 
specific relief through a decree conclusive in nature, as distinguished 
from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state
 of facts. 


 Corollary to the requirement of an actual case or controversy is
 the requirement of ripeness. A question is ripe for adjudication when 
the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the 
individual challenging it. 
For a case to be considered ripe for 
adjudication, it is a prerequisite that something has then been 
accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into 
the picture, 
AND
 the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself as a result of the challenged action.
 He must show that he 
has sustained
 or 
is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury
 as a result of the act complained of. 


 Here, petitioners did not allege that they already sustained or 
are immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury from R.A. No.
 11199: 
The mere passage of the law does not per se absolutely 
determine the justiciability of a particular case attacking the law's 
constitutionality. Petitioners 
did not even allege that the law is already implemented against their interests
.
 They simply gave a broad statement that "[t]he execution of Section 9-B
 of the 2018 SSS Law will definitely work injustice and irreparable 
damage to the petitioner manning agencies which are made to answer to so
 much liabilities as employer when it is not the seafarer's employer."

 Again, there must be an immediate or threatening injury to petitioners 
as a result of the challenged action; and not a mere speculation. 
(emphases and underscoring added) 




 In 
Falcis III v. Civil Registrar General
,
[15]
 the Court also rejected the idea that the mere passage of a law 
per se
 makes for an actual case or controversy. Thus: 
  


 First, 
whether or not the mere passage of the Family Code creates an actual case or controversy
 reviewable by this Court... 


 â¦.


 It is 
not enough that laws or regulations have been passed or are in effect

 when their constitutionality is questioned. The judiciary interprets 
and applies the law. "It does not formulate public policy, which is the 
province of the legislative and executive branches of government." Thus,
 it does not â by the mere existence of a law or regulation â embark on 
an exercise that may render laws or regulations inefficacious .... 


 â¦.


 
Ultimately, petitions before this Court that challenge an executive or legislative enactment must be based on actual facts
,
 sufficiently for a proper joinder of issues to be resolved. If 
litigants wish to assail a statute or regulation on its face, the burden
 is on them to prove that the narrowly-drawn exception for an 
extraordinary judicial review of such statute or regulation applies. 


 
When faced with speculations â situations that have not yet 
fully ripened into clear breaches of legally demandable rights or 
obligations â this Court shall refrain from passing upon the case. 
Any
 inquiries that may be made may be roving, unlimited, and unchecked. In 
contrast to political branches of government, courts must deal with 
specificities... 


 â¦.


 
It is the parties' duty to demonstrate actual cases or controversies worthy of judicial resolution.
 


 
Pleadings before this Court must show a violation of an existing legal right
 or a controversy that is ripe for judicial determination.... 


 â¦.


 
Facts are the basis of an actual case or controversy.
 To reiterate, "
there must be sufficient facts to enable the Court to intelligently adjudicate the issues
." Thus, as illustrated in 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc.
: 




 
Petitioners' obscure allegations of sporadic "surveillance"
 and supposedly being tagged as "communist fronts" in no way approximate
 a credible threat of prosecution. From these allegations, the Court is 
being lured to render an advisory opinion
, which is not its function.... 


 â¦.




 Here, 
petitioner has no actual facts that present a real conflict between the parties
 of this case. The Petition 
presents no actual case or controversy
. 


 Despite a goal of proving to this Court that there is a 
continuing and pervasive violation of fundamental rights of a 
marginalized minority group, 
the Petition is woefully bereft of sufficient actual facts to substantiate its arguments
.... 


 â¦.


 Petitioner presents no proof at all of the immediate, inextricable danger that the Family Code poses to him. 
His
 assertions of injury cannot, without sufficient proof, be directly 
linked to the imputed cause, the existence of the Family Code.
 His fixation on 
how the Family Code is the definitive [be]cause of his inability to find a partner is plainly non sequitur
. 


 
Similarly, anticipation of harm is not equivalent to direct injury.
 Petitioner fails to show how the Family Code is the proximate cause of his alleged deprivations. 
His
 mere allegation that this injury comes from "the law's normative 
impact" is insufficient to establish the connection between the Family 
Code and his alleged injury.
 


 
If the mere passage of a law does not create an actual case 
or controversy, neither can it be a source of direct injury to establish
 legal standing.
 This Court is 
not duty bound to find facts on petitioner's behalf just so he can support his claims
. (emphases added) 




 I further refer to Justice Jardeleza's 
Concurring Opinion
 in 
Falcis III
,  to which Justice Caguioa also agreed, thus: 
  


 
The petition presents no actual case or controversy....
 Furthermore, a case is ripe for adjudication 
when
 the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the 
individual challenging it. Something must have been accomplished or 
performed by either branch of Government
 before a court may come into the picture, 
and
 a 
petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury
 to him/her as a result of the challenged action. 


 
On its face, it presents a hypothetical and contingent event
, not ripe for adjudication, which is hinged on 
petitioner's future plan
 of settling down with a person of the same-sex. 


 Petitioner alleged that "the prohibition against the right to 
marry the same-sex injures [his] plans to settle down and have a 
companion for life in his beloved country." 
Yet as of the filing of the petition, petitioner has no partner
.
 He lamented that his "ability to find and enter into a long-term 
monogamous same-sex relationship is impaired because of the absence of a
 legal incentive for gay individuals to seek such relationship." 
Significantly, however, even if he has a partner, petitioner admitted in
 open court that it is not automatic that his partner might want to 
marry him. 
Thus, petitioner cannot, did not or even attempted to, 
file an application for marriage license before the civil registry of 
his residence.
 (emphases added) 




 Similarly, respondent herein has never alleged that the IRR of RA 
9711 is already being implemented against its interest. Thus, there has 
yet to be a ripening of seeds which is necessary to confer the courts 
with jurisdiction over respondent's petition for declaratory relief. 
 
RA 9711 applies to tobacco


 I would like to address the arguments raised for nullifying Article III, Book II of the 
Implementing Rules and Regulations 
of
 
RA 9711.    
  






1.


The language of RA 9711 does not expressly include tobacco as a health product.






 


 






2.


Construed in its totality, RA 9711 
could not have intended to include tobacco within its regulatory 
mechanism since its inclusion would result in its prohibition and not 
merely its regulation, contrary to the legislative intent not to 
prohibit tobacco but only to regulate it. Prohibition will be the 
end-result because the FDA is statutorily mandated by RA 3270 as amended
 by RA 9711 to prohibit a product whose ill-effects outweigh its 
therapeutic effects, and the FDA has ruled that tobacco has only 
ill-effects and no therapeutic value whatsoever. 






 


 






3.


 
Tobacco-specific legislations, 
especially those expressly mentioned in Section 25 of RA 9711 have 
divested the FDA of jurisdiction over tobacco.






a.	Tobacco and cigarettes are health products




 It is 
admitted
 that RA 9711 does 
not
 mention expressly 
tobacco
. But this 
does not mean
 that RA 9711 does not apply to tobacco. We recognize though that 
softdrinks
 fall within RA 9711 because softdrinks can be 
classified
 under 
one of the categories
 regulated by RA 9711 â 
food
.
[16]
 
 In the 
same manner
, we do 
not
 have to search for the word 
tobacco
 in RA 9711 to be able to conclude cogently that tobacco 
falls within 
the ambit of this statute. So long as tobacco 
can be categorized
 under one of the regulated items in RA 9711, just like softdrinks, tobacco 
falls within the
 FDA's regulatory regime. 
 I most respectfully submit that 
tobacco
 falls within the definition of 
drug
,
[17]
 and 
cigarette
 within the definition of 
device
,
[18]
 and since both 
drug
 and 
device
 are also 
health products
, tobacco and cigarette are also 
health
 
products
.
[19]
 As such, 
tobacco
 and 
cigarette
 fall, within the regulatory jurisdiction of the FDA. 

 The other basis of the ruling that tobacco, and especially cigarette, 
is not subject to FDA jurisdiction, may be re-stated as follows â
 






1.


The inclusion of tobacco 
within the regulatory mechanism of RA 9711 would have meant its 
prohibition and not merely its regulation because tobacco's ill-effects 
totally outweigh its absent therapeutic value. 






 


 






2.


Under RA 9711 the FDA would have no 
choice but to ban tobacco from the market because the FDA had already 
concluded that tobacco had only ill-effects and no therapeutic value. 






 


 






3.


This inevitable action of the FDA â 
i.e
.,
 prohibition of tobacco â would be illegal because contrary to 
established legislative intent as expressed in Section 25 of RA 9711
[20]
 and tobacco-specific legislations. 








This rationale 
follows the thought-process
 in the United States Supreme Court case of 
Food and Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp
.
[21]
 Notably, a statutory amendment to the US FDA's charter was introduced in 2009, 
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act)
, which 
expanded the US FDA's authority
 to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products, 
to address the otherwise adverse ruling
 in the 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp
. case and similar cases. Notably, the ruling in 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp
. was 
not unanimous
 since a vigorous dissent was registered against the exclusion of tobacco from the US FDA's jurisdiction. 


 Going to our own FDA, tobacco is a 
drug
: it is an 
article
 other than food that respondent knows and offers to be used 
to affect the structure of any function of the body of humans
 or animals. The science behind this 
effect
 on the 
structure of any function
 has been explained in the dissent in 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp
., as follows: 
  


 Although I now oversimplify, the FDA has determined that 
once nicotine enters the body, the blood carries it almost immediately to the brain
. See 61 Fed.Reg. 44698-44699 (1966). Nicotine then 
binds
 to receptors on the surface of brain cells, setting off a series of 
chemical reactions that alter one's mood and produce feelings of 
sedation and stimulation
. See id., at 44699, 44739. Nicotine also 
increases the number of nicotinic receptors on the brain's surface, and alters its normal electrical activity
. See id., at 44739. And nicotine 
stimulates the transmission of a natural chemical that "rewards" the body with pleasurable sensations
 (dopamine), causing nicotine addiction. See id., at 44700, 44721-44722. The upshot is that **1320 
nicotine
 stabilizes mood, suppresses appetite, tranquilizes, and satisfies a 
physical craving that nicotine itself has helped to create â all through
 chemical action
 within the body after being metabolized. 


 
This physiologyâand not simply smoker psychologyâhelps to 
explain why as many as 75% of adult smokers believe that smoking 
"reduce[s] nervous irritation,"
 60 Fed.Reg. 41579 (1995); why 73% of
 young people (10- to 22-year-olds) who begin smoking say they do so for
 "relaxation," 61 Fed.Reg. 44814 (1996); and why less than 3% of smokers
 succeed in quitting each year, although 70% want to quit, id., at 
44704. 
That chemistry also helps to explain the Surgeon General's 
findings that smokers believe "smoking [makes them] feel better" and 
smoke more "in situations involving negative mood."
 Id., at 44814. And, 
for
 present purposes, that chemistry demonstrates that nicotine affects the
 "structure" and "function" of the body in a manner that is quite 
similar to the effects of other regulated substances
. See id., at 
44667 (FDA regulates Valium, NoDoz, weight-loss products). Indeed, 
addiction, sedation, stimulation, and weight loss are precisely the 
kinds of product effects that the FDA typically reviews and controls. 
And, 
since the nicotine in cigarettes
 *170 
plainly is not a 
"food," its chemical effects suffice to establish that it is as a "drug"
 (and the cigarette that delivers it a drugÂ­ delivery "device")
 for the purpose of the FDCA.




 This is 
science
. And, it has not been refuted by respondent in this case.
  A 
cigarette
 is a 
health-related device
 as RA 9711
[22]
 defines it: 
any device
 not used in health care but has been 
determined
 by the FDA 
to adversely affect the health
 of the people. A 
cigarette
 is a 
drug-delivery device
.
 Both 
tobacco
 and 
cigarette
 are health products: they are both "food, 
drugs
, cosmetics, 
devices
. . . " and "
products that may have an effect on health
 which require regulations as determined by the FDA." 
 Justice Caguioa ripostes that practically all products have an effect on health: 
  


 Take for instance firearms, which could arguably fall within 
this meaning because of the risks it poses to the health and safety of 
its owner and the public -- not unlike the adverse and harmful effects of
 tobacco and tobacco products. As well, gasoline, whether ingested or 
used as fuel for motor vehicles, could be reasonably construed as a 
health product if the Court were to follow the same line of argument. 
That said, it is inconceivable to consider these products as health 
products that the FDA can regulateâ¦.




 With all due respect, Justice Caguioa is comparing apples and oranges with poison. 
 The reason why tobacco and cigarettes are under regulation of the FDA is not because they have negative impact on health 
per se
, but because 
their 
only
 purpose is to negatively impact health.

 Unlike firearms which could be used for safety and protection and 
gasoline which is an everyday commodity, tobacco and cigarettes simply 
don't have any other use than poison the body. Thus, our only guide in 
determining which agency has authority to regulate such product is its 
sole purpose
 which is to 
negatively impact health
. Based on this criterion it is the DOH, through the FDA, which has authority to regulate such health product. 
  


 
b.	The FDA has jurisdiction over health products including tobacco and cigarettes




 The 
otherwise expansive jurisdiction
 of the FDA is 
tempered by Section 25
 of RA 9711. This is 
admitted
 even by the FDA itself. Section 25 states: 
  


 
This Act shall govern all health products
: Provided, that 
nothing in this Act
 shall be 
deemed to modify
 the 
sole and exclusive jurisdiction
 of 
other
 specialized agencies and special laws 
only insofar as the acts covered
 by these specialized agencies and laws, including, but not limited to, those covered 
by Republic Act No. 9211, Executive Order No. 245
, Executive Order No. 18, and Presidential Decree No. 1468. 




 To reiterate, it is 
in this portion
 of the rationale where the 
allegation
 and 
existence
 of the 
actual facts
 of the 
injury
 or 
threat of injury
 to respondent, if there had been any, assumes 
supreme importance
. The 
nature
 of the
 injury
 or 
threat of injury
 â if otherwise alleged and of course proved â would have 
determined to what extent
 the FDA acted 
ultra vires
 or 
encroached
 the other agencies' respective jurisdictions. This 
underlying fact
 is 
extremely relevant
 because of the 
structure itself
 of Section 25. 
 Section 25 
begins
 with an acknowledgement and affirmation of the FDA's jurisdiction over 
health products
, which include 
drugs
 and 
devices
 (therefore tobacco and cigarettes) â "[t]his Act 
shall govern
 
all
 health products. . . ."
 It is 
only by way of an exception
 that it 
recognizes
 the jurisdictions of other specialized agencies and specialized laws. This means that 
without this qualification
, RA 9711
[23]
 would have 
actually amended
 or 
even repealed
 such statutes as RA 9211
[24]
 and EO 245.
[25]


 In any event, the 
exception
 to the 
expansive
 FDA jurisdiction is 
qualified
 by two important qualifiers:    
  






(i)
 


the other agencies' jurisdiction must be 
sole and exclusive
 (Section 25 itself already determined that the jurisdictions under RA 9211 and EO 245 are 
sole
 and 
exclusive
); and






 


 






(ii)


 
the 
exception
 applies "
only insofar as the acts covered
 by these specialized agencies and laws," here, 
RA 9211
 and 
EO 245
. 








This means that the 
expansive FDA jurisdiction
 applies to tobacco and its derivative products 
except only insofar as the acts
 covered by RA 9211 and EO 245. Hence, we 
cannot immediately divest
 the FDA of any jurisdiction over tobacco and its derivatives 
without looking into
 the 
acts covered
 by RA 9211 and EO 245. 


 
More important
, we 
cannot castrate
 the FDA of 
any
 jurisdiction over tobacco and its derivatives 
solely because
 this 
exercise
 of jurisdiction 
may actually
 or 
effectively result in
 the 
prohibition
 of the sale or use of tobacco and its derivatives or 
more likely
 the 
particular commercial products
 thereof. 
 Whether the FDA's exercise of jurisdiction 
will cause
 the 
prohibition
 of tobacco or its derivatives is 
not the test
 of the propriety of the FDA's exercise of jurisdiction, as asserted here. 
Rather
, the 
test
 is whether the 
exception
 to the FDA's jurisdiction over 
health products
 
applies
. 
 If 
particularized injury
 or 
threat of injury
 has been alleged and proved, it 
would have been easy
 to determine if the 
act done by the FDA
 falls within 
its RA 9711 jurisdiction
 or falls within the 
Section 25 exception for other specialized agencies
. The fact is that 
there are no facts
, yet we proceeded to rule on this case 
as if there were facts constituting an actual case or controversy
. Consequently, the 
resulting doctrines
 produced, I respectfully submit, are 
inaccurate
 and 
dangerous precedents
. They 
do not address
 a 
particularized
 controversy or dispute 
but
 a 
social
 and 
policy
 decision that for this reason is 
overbroad
 and 
overreaching
. 
 In any event, RA 9211 
does not intend
 to cover the 
whole subject matter
 about 
tobacco
. Instead, RA 9211 addresses 
only these specified acts 
and/or 
circumstances
: 
  
  SECTION 5. Smoking Ban in Public Places. 
SECTION 6. Designation of Smoking and Non-smoking Areas. 
SECTION 7. Prohibition and/or Regulation of Vending Machines, Self-Service Facilities. 
 SECTION 8. Removal of all non-compliant tobacco-related 
self-Service displays or facilities, advertising, labeling and other 
items. 
 SECTION 9. Prohibition of Minors from Using, Selling Cigarettes. 
SECTION 10. Prohibition of Sale	of Tobacco	Products	Within School Perimeters.
SECTION 11. Signage Requirements.
SECTION 12. Requirement of Proof of Age Verification. 
SECTION 13. Warnings on Cigarette Packages. 
SECTION 14. Warnings in Advertising. 
SECTION 15. Restrictions on Advertising. 
SECTION 16. Restrictions on Print Media Advertising.
 SECTION 17. Restrictions on Outdoor Advertising. 
 SECTION 18. Restrictions on Advertising in Cinemas.
SECTION 19. Restrictions on Television and Radio Advertising. 
 SECTION 20. Restrictions on Advertising in Audio, Video and Computer Cassettes/Discs and Similar Medium.
SECTION 21. Restrictions on Advertising on the Internet and Similar Medium.
 SECTION 22. Ban on Advertisements. 
SECTION 23. Restrictions on Tobacco Promotions.
 SECTION 24. Naming Rights. 
SECTION 25. Restrictions on Sponsorships. 
SECTION 26. Ban on Sponsorships.
SECTION 27. Prohibition	on the Distribution	of Samples of Tobacco Products to Persons Below 18 Years Old. 
 SECTION 33. a. Tobacco	Growers'	Assistance Program;	b. Tobacco 
Growers' Cooperative; c. National Smoking Cessation Program; d. Research
 and Development Program; e. National Tobacco-Free Public Education 
Program; f.		Displaced Cigarette	Factory	Workers'		Assistance	Program;	
g.	Health Programs; h. Withdrawal Clinics
SECTION 34. Information Drive.
 SECTION 35. Instruction on the Hazardous Effect of Smoking as Part of School Curricula. 


 It is 
glaring
 that RA 9211 covers only 
post-production acts
 when the tobacco or its derivative is 
ready to be introduced to commerce
 and its 
after-effects
. Section 30 of RA 9211 is clear on this matter, 
viz
.: 
  


 
Section 30. 
Application to Tobacco Products
 - This provision of this Act shall apply to all tobacco products 
placed into commerce
 in the Philippines. xxx (emphasis added) 




 Justice Caguioa nevertheless argues that the Health Secretary's 
vice-chairmanship of the IAC-T sufficiently vests said committee with 
authority to regulate 
all health aspects
 relating to tobacco and tobacco products under RA 9211.
[26]
 
 I respectfully differ. 

 The mere inclusion of the Health Secretary in the IAC-T does not mean 
that the agency surrenders its regulatory power over tobacco cigarettes 
in favor of the committee. Too, the policy declaration and statement of 
general purpose under Sections 2 and 3 of RA 9211 does not convincingly 
support his theory.
[27]
 For 
under the specific provisions of RA 9211, the IAC-T has very limited 
concerns in relation to the health impact of tobacco products. 
 Specifically, the ambit of IAC-T's mandate under RA 9211 refers only to those mentioned therein â 
Smoking
 Ban in Public Places; Designated Smoking and Non-smoking Areas; Access 
Restrictions based on Age; Sale of Tobacco Products Within School 
Perimeters; Signages; Warnings on Cigarette Packages; Warnings in 
Advertising; Restrictions on Advertising; Restrictions on Print Media 
Advertising; Restrictions on Outdoor Advertising; Restrictions on 
Advertising in Cinemas; Restrictions on Television and Radio 
Advertising; Restrictions on Advertising in Audio, Video and Computer 
Cassettes/Discs and Similar Medium; Restrictions on Advertising on the 
Internet and Similar Medium; Ban on Advertisements; Restrictions on 
Tobacco Promotions; Naming Rights; Restrictions on Sponsorships; Ban on 
Sponsorships; Restrictions on Sampling to Minors
. There are also 
Programs and Projects

 for which the IAC-T are responsible for. As regards health programs, 
the award of grants to hospitals for researches on smoke-related 
illnesses is the IAC-T's mandate. 
 Clearly, RA 9211 
does not cover
, for example, 
manufacturing health standards
 and 
health-related use standards
.
 These pre-commerce concerns are therefore beyond the regulatory power 
of the IAC-T and falls squarely within the jurisdiction fo the FDA under
 RA 9711. To illustrate: 
 
 (image should be here) 
 

 To be sure, none of the provisions of RA 9211 squarely deal with the 
production and manufacture of tobacco and tobacco products. Surely, it 
would be a stretch to interpret RA 9211 as authorizing the IAC-T to 
regulate the production and manufacture of tobacco products when none of
 its provisions even make reference these activities. Thus, to fill this
 gap in RA 9211, the provisions of RA 9711 on the general authority of 
the FDA must come into play. 
 In fact, President Duterte issued last February 2020 his 
Executive Order No. 106
 entitled 
PROHIBITING
 THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING AND SALE OF UNREGISTERED 
AND/OR ADULTERATED ELECTRONIC NICOTINE/NON-NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS, 
HEATED TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND OTHER NOVEL TOBACCO PRODUCTS, AMENDING 
EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 26 (S. 2017) AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
, which 
recognized
 and utilized the FDA's jurisdiction under RA 9711 to deal with 
Electronic Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS/ENNDS) and 
heated tobacco products (HTPs).
 Particularly, the role of the FDA 
was delineated as follows: (i)	registration of all e-liquids, solutions 
or refills forming components of ENDS/ENNDS or HTPs; product standards 
for all devices forming components of ENDS/ENNDS or HTPs; licensing of 
all establishments engaged in the manufacture, distribution, 
importation, marketing and sale of ENDS/ENNDS, HTPs, or their 
components; licensing of entry/importation of ENDS/ENNDS, HTPs, and 
their components into the Philippine market. 
 On the other hand, 
EO 245 covers acts
 that are meant to "
promote
 the 
development of the tobacco industry
 and to 
improve
 the 
quality of life of all those who depend upon the industry
 as a 
source of livelihood
, especially the tobacco farmers" (Section 1). The powers and functions
[28]
 of the 
National Tobacco Administration (NTA)
 are 
circumscribed
 by these purposes under Section 2: 
  


 a.	To 
improve the economic and living conditions and raise the quality of life of the tobacco farmers
 including those who depend upon the industry for their livelihood; and


 b.	To 
promote the balanced and integrated growth and development of the tobacco industry
 to help make agriculture a solid basis for industrialization. 




 Obviously, the NTA under EO 245 
does not have jurisdiction
 over 
health aspects
 of tobacco and its derivatives. The NTA is 
concerned only with acts
 that can be described as 
economic
 and 
industry-related
. Therefore, so long as the FDA does 
not
 regulate those 
acts
 referred to above as belonging to the NTA, 
the FDA would be within its right and authority to do so
. 
 In the exercise of its jurisdiction, the FDA 
cannot act
 in a manner that would 
prevent
 the other specialized agencies from doing 
the acts covered
 by their specialized laws, here, 
RA 9211
 and 
EO 245
. This is 
pursuant to Section 25
 of RA 9711. 
 But 
whether
 the FDA has breached this boundary 
must be
 resolved on a 
case-by-case
 basis. 

 For example, if a tobacco product has been laced with cyanide or 
illegal drugs, the FDA would be within its right and jurisdiction 
to prohibit
 this product from reaching the market. While this 
may have an impact
 on the 
NTA's mandate to protect the tobacco industry as an economic base for tobacco workers
, though a small impact it may be, the resolution of this issue will 
not
 depend upon a 
bright-line rule
 but the 
balancing of interests
. This 
inevitably calls for
 a 
fact-centered analysis
 â hence, the necessity for an 
actual case or controversy
 and the 
precise allegation
 and 
proof
 of 
injury
 or at least 
threat of injury
. This inquiry 
cannot proceed
 on 
speculations
 or 
hypothetical assertions
, much less, 
on the absence of facts as in the present case
. 
 This segues to a 
clarification
 of the 
FDA's jurisdiction
. Contrary to our holding, the FDA is 
not only concerned
 with a health product's 
safety
 and 
efficacy
. There are 
other equally compelling standards
 under RA 9711 that the FDA 
must weigh
 and 
consider
 in the exercise of its jurisdiction. Some of these 
standards
 are: 
  
	good quality,
 purity, 
 rational use, 
strength, 
registration with FDA, 
compliance with regulations regarding 
operation of manufacturers, importers, exporters, distributors, 
wholesalers, drug outlets, and other establishments and facilities of 
health products,
 reasonable indication that a product has caused or contributed 
to the death, serious illness or serious injury to a consumer, a 
patient, or any person, 
 finding	of imminent	injury,	or dangerous	or grossly	deceptive characteristics, 
 presence of and implementation of a risk management plan, 
presence or strengthening of post market surveillance system in 
monitoring health products, 
 adulteration or manufacturing, preparation or storage under unsanitary conditions, 
 current good manufacturing practice, 
 false or misleading labelling (but must tread carefully so as 
not to unduly usurp the functions of the Inter-Agency-Tobacco under RA 
9211), 
 transparency as to the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the manufacture of a drug or device,	 
 assessment of the methods used in, and the facilities of a drug
 or device to determine adequacy to preserve its identity, strength, 
quality and purity, 
among others
. 


 In addition, the FDA is 
not hamstrung to simply prohibit
 tobacco and its derivatives. RA 9711 has provided the FDA with an 
arsenal of remedies
 and 
enforcement actions
 when its standards are breached.
[29]
 Before even that point is reached, RA 9711 has mandated FDA to observe 
procedural fairness

 before imposing any remedy or enforcement action, which includes 
coordinating with and hearing other specialized agencies and 
stakeholders. 
 Clearly, it is 
not correct
 for us to oust the FDA of 
any
 and 
all jurisdiction
 over tobacco and its derivatives. The
 language of RA 9711
 precludes this conclusion. A 
sensible
 and 
sensitive reading

 of Section 25, RA 9711 and the specialized jurisdictions of other 
agencies disproves our conclusion. What is at stake is not an all or 
nothing proposition, but a nuanced harmonization and congruence of the 
several jurisdictions at play vis-Ã -vis the almighty tobacco. 
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote to 
grant
 the petition, 
reverse
 and 
set aside
 the decisions of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals, 
dismiss
 the petition for declaratory relief, and 
affirm
 the validity of Article III, Book II of the 
Implementing Rules and Regulations
 of RA 9711.

Belgica v. Executive Secretary
,
 G.R. No. 210503, October 8, 2019 [Belgica]: "Jurisprudence defines an 
actual case or controversy as one which 'involves a conflict of legal 
rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial 
resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference 
or dispute.' 
Subsumed in the requirement of an actual case or controversy is
 the requirement of ripeness, and "[f]or a case to be considered ripe for adjudication, it is a prerequisite 
that
 something has then been accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into the picture, and 
the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself as a result of the challenged action
.' To be sure, 
the Court may not wield its power of judicial review to address a hypothetical problem
. '
Without any
 completed action or a 
concrete threat of injury
 to the petitioning party, 
the act is not yet ripe for adjudication
."'

 522 Phil. 1, 27 (2006): "It is well-settled that the Court's exercise 
of the power of judicial review requires the concurrence of the 
following elements: (1) there must be an 
actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power
;
 (2) the person challenging the act must have the standing to question 
the validity of the subject act or issuance; otherwise stated, 
he 
must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he 
has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its 
enforcement
; (3) the question of constitutionality must be raised at
 the earliest opportunity; and (4) the issue of constitutionality must 
be the very 
lis mota
 of the case."
