ZALAMEDA, J.:


We resolve the Motion for Reconsideration (Motion)
[1]
 of the 24 September 2019 Decision rendered by the Court 
En Banc
 dismissing the Special Civil Action for Prohibition with Prayer for the Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order (Petition).
[2]
 
 Petitioners - editors and publisher of 
FHM Philippines
 - sought to enjoin the conduct of preliminary investigation of a criminal complaint filed against them for 
grave scandal under Article 200 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and violation of Manila City Ordinance No. 7780 which penalizes the printing, distribution, circulation and sale of scandalous, obscene and pornographic materials.
[3]
 According to petitioners, the vague and expansive language of Ordinance No. 7780 is unconstitutional for being patently offensive to their rights to free speech and expression, due process, privacy and the principle of separation of church and state.
[4]
 
 On 11 November 2013, and while this case was still pending resolution, petitioners informed the Court that the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Manila had issued a Resolution dated 25 June 2013 dismissing the charges for violation of Article 200 of the RPC and Ordinance No. 7780. A criminal information for violation of Article 201(3) of the RPC
[5]
 was ordered filed against petitioners instead. This case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 13-30084 and assigned to Branch 16 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, which was eventually dismissed.
[6]
 
 In dismissing the Petition, the Court, voting 9 to 4, held that: (1) the dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioners for violation of the provisions of Ordinance No. 7780 has rendered this case moot and academic; and (2) Ordinance No. 7780, being an anti-obscenity law, cannot be facially attacked on the ground of overbreadth as obscenity is unprotected speech.
[7]
 
 Petitioners, in their Motion for Reconsideration dated 06 February 2020, ask the Court to revisit its dismissal of the case on the ground of mootness. They likewise reiterate their arguments for the declaration of Ordinance No. 7780's unconstitutionality.
[8]
 
 We DENY the Motion.
 It is not disputed that the criminal charges against petitioners for violation of Ordinance No. 8870 have been dismissed.
[9]
 This dismissal has clearly rendered the case for prohibition moot and academic.
 Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe and Associate Justices Marvic Leonen and Rosmari D. Carandang, however, are of the view that the case persists as the issue raised by petitioners against the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 is separate and distinct form the matter of their criminal prosecution.
[10]
 Senior Associate Justice Bernabe posits that a declaration on the matter of constitutionality would have practical legal value give its "expansive scope" and "subsistence in the legislative books of the City of Manila. . . "
[11]
 Justice Leonen, on the other hand, sees the case as falling within the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception of the rule on mootness.
[12]
 
First
. Without doubt, any ruling from this Court, with respect to the constitutionality of a subsisting law would have legal value, this Court being the "final arbiter of the Constitution."
[13]
 As some commentators have put it, Supreme Court decisions "change the law and, thus, the country, by their very publication."
[14]
 This, however, surely does not mean that the Court must settle 
all
 constitutional controversies presented before it 
under all circumstances
; hence, the constitutional policy of avoidance.
[15]
 To borrow from the words of Justice Kapunan, "[w]here a controversy can be settled on a platform other than the one involving constitutional adjudication," as in this case, "the court should exercise becoming modesty and avoid the constitutional question."
[16]
 
Second
. As explained in the Decision, the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception has been applied in limited cases, that is, in cases where the following requisites have been shown to concur: (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.
[17]
 Both of these requirements are absent in this case.
 Petitioners have not shown that criminal prosecution under the Ordinance would be of such short duration as to prevent this Court from ever being able to rule on the constitutionality of its provisions. Neither have they demonstrated any reasonable likelihood that they would be subjected to criminal prosecution under the same Ordinance again. In 
Oclarino v. Navarro
,
[18]
 we clarified that reasonable expectation is something more than mere speculation that the complaining party would be subjected to the same action. As noted in the Decision, the OCP of Manila did not even bother to challenge the dismissal of the case against petitioners. In fact, petitioners were hard-pressed to show any other prosecution, whether against them or others, under said Ordinance, much less on the level of occurrence they argue they would be prosecuted. This, to this Court's mind, may also explain why, by petitioners' own admission, "no other case has been filed to question [Ordinance No. 7780]'s constitutionality."
[19]
 
Third
. Petitioners' arguments are facial attacks against Ordinance No. 7780 on the ground of overbreadth. A litigant, however, cannot mount a facial challenge against a criminal statute on either vagueness or overbreadth grounds. The overbreadth doctrine finds special application in free speech cases; it is not used to test the validity of penal laws.
[20]
 
Fourth
. Ordinance No. 7780 is a law which criminalizes obscenity and pornography. These are unprotected speech which the State has the right and mandate, as 
parens patriae
, to protect the public from.
[21]
 Laws regulating such materials cannot be facially invalidated precisely because there is no "transcendent value to society" that would justify such attack.
[22]
 This is all the more important especially when one considers that the Manila City Council, arguably an indispensable party considering that Ordinance No. 7780 was its enactment, was not made party to the proceedings and therefore was not heard on this specific issue.
[23]
 We acknowledge that this Court has, in the past, seen fit to resolve questions even when subsequent events have rendered the resolution of said matter unnecessary at that time.
[24]
 Further research would nevertheless also show an equally significant number of cases wherein this Court has seen fit to stay its hand and refrain from delving into the substantive aspects of a case where the case can be resolved on 
other
 grounds,
[25]
 novelty or presence of constitutionality issues notwithstanding.
 Finally, in dismissing this case, we do not mean to give short shrift to the constitutional freedoms sought to be protected by petitioners when they filed this case. However, it is one thing to strike down a legislative enactment (albeit in this case, a local ordinance) determined to be violative of fundamental rights in an actual case 
after a full-blown hearing, where all pertinent issues are sufficiently and exhaustively briefed by all indispensable parties
, and quite another to cast aspersions on a law based on seemingly unfounded presumptions
[26]
 and, on that basis, declare said law unconstitutional. We must be reminded of Justice Stone's admonition: "While unconstitutional exercise of power by the executive and legislative branches of the government is subject to judicial restraint, the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint."

DISSENTING OPINION
 
 
 
PERLAS-BERNABE, 
J
.:
 I write to reiterate my 
dissent
 against the majority's ruling on the main. I maintain my view that the present petition assailing the constitutionality of Manila Ordinance No. 7780 or the "Anti-Obscenity and Pornography [O]rdinance of the City of Manila"
[1]
 (Ordinance No. 7780) should not have been dismissed on the ground of mootness, and instead, should have been resolved by the Court on the merits, and consequently decreed unconstitutional based on the overbreadth doctrine.
 To recount, petitioners Allan Madrilejos, Allan Hernandez, Glenda Gil, and Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng (petitioners) were the respective editor-in-chief, managing editor, circulation manager, and president of Summit Publishing Company, Inc., which published the FHM Magazine.
[2]
 In 2008, they were charged before the City Prosecutor's Office of Manila under Ordinance No. 7780 which proscribes the "printing, distribution, circulation, sale, and exhibition[,]" as well as the "production, public showing[,] and viewing" of 
obscene and pornographic acts of materials.
[3]
 Subsequently, petitioners filed this 
petition for prohibition
 assailing the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 for being patently offensive to [the] 
constitutional right to free speech and expression
, and for violating "privacy rights," among others. They claim that the definitions of obscenity and pornography in Ordinance No. 7780 are 
unduly expansive
 in that they disregard the guidelines prescribed in 
Miller v. California
 (
Miller
),
[4]
 to wit: 
 
 (a) whether "the average person, applying contemporary community standards" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, x x x (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
 
 
 Respondents Lourdes Gatdula, Agnes Lopez, and Hilarion Buban of the City Prosecutor's Office of Manila (respondents) countered that since our statutes do not define what is "obscene," the Ordinance's definition of obscenity could very well be the contemporary community standard under the 
Miller
 test.
[5]
 Pending resolution of the said petition, the criminal charge against petitioners was dismissed. This notwithstanding, petitioners did not move to withdraw the present action, arguing that the case has not become moot by the fact of the criminal case's dismissal since the distinct issue anent the constitutionality/validity of the Ordinance subsists. However, taking cognizance of the supervening dismissal of the criminal case, the Court likewise dismissed the present petition on the grounds that: (
a
) the dismissal of the criminal charge against petitioners rendered the case moot; and (
b
) Ordinance No. 7780, an anti-obscenity law, cannot be facially attacked on overbreadth grounds because obscenity is unprotected speech.
[6]
 According to the 
ponencia
 on the main, petitioners' purpose in filing the petition was to stop the conduct of the preliminary investigation on their alleged violation of an unconstitutional ordinance. In any case, petitioners still failed to establish a cause of action to warrant a ruling in their favor, holding that they cannot mount a facial challenge against the Ordinance on the ground of overbreadth because the present petition does not involve a free speech case as it stemmed, rather, from an obscenity prosecution. Aggrieved, petitioners moved for reconsideration.
[7]
 The present 
ponencia
 denies petitioners' motion, reiterating that the dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioners has rendered moot this prohibition case. It then proceeds to counter the dissenting views by: (1) insisting on the constitutional policy of avoidance and judicial restraint when no full-blown hearing is conducted with all indispensable parties, such as the Manila City Council; (2) limiting the application of the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to the mootness rule; (3) rejecting an overbreadth analysis on the ground that such doctrine is not used to test the validity of penal laws; and (4) noting that obscenity is unprotected speech that has no transcendent value to society.
[8]
 I maintain my dissent. 
 Verily, it is my view that the present prohibition case is not mooted by the dismissal of the criminal charge at the prosecutor level because 
the issue regarding the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 is separate and distinct from the matter of petitioners' criminal prosecution.
 From the records, it is clear that petitioners not only questioned the legality of the criminal prosecution against them but also the validity of Ordinance No. 7780 itself, 
invoking their constitutional right to free speech and expression.
 Indeed, despite the dismissal of the criminal case, petitioners' proffered curtailment of their free speech rights â as well as other persons similarly situated as them â still looms in the horizon because Ordinance No. 7780 remains valid and subsisting. 
 To be sure, case law states that a case is moot "when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, 
so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use
." "[T]he judgment will 
not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect
 because, in the nature of things, it 
cannot be enforced
."
[9]
 To my mind, there remains to be practical legal value in resolving the constitutionality issue as regards Ordinance No. 7780, considering its chilling effect on protected speech. In view of its expansive scope, its subsistence in the legislative books of the City of Manila has the 
effect of chilling
 otherwise protected forms of speech because of the impending threat of further prosecution based on the same. This concern is particularly relevant for petitioners who 
regularly
 publish a magazine (
i.e
., monthly) in a particular genre. As asserted in their motion for reconsideration, petitioners' roles as editors and publishers of the monthly FHM Magazines render them continuously vulnerable to criminal charges under the assailed ordinance for every publication. Hence, the dismissal of the criminal charge against them alone does not remove their interest in pursuing this case on their own behalf and of other similarly situated publishers. Besides, the relief prayed for by petitioners in filing the present petition was not only to obtain the dismissal of the criminal charges against them but, moreover, to directly assail the validity of Ordinance No. 7780. Therefore, 
the constitutionality issue persists as a live controversy
 which the Court is duty-bound to resolve. Accordingly, since the constitutionality issue is not moot, the exception of capable of repetition yet evading review discussed in the 
ponencia
 is not even necessary to be applied in this case.
 Furthermore, contrary to the 
ponencia
, a 
facial challenge
 against Ordinance No. 7780 on 
overbreadth
 grounds is 
proper
 in this case. The overbreadth doctrine decrees that "a governmental purpose may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms";
[10]
 hence, 
a statute or ordinance may be declared as unconstitutional if it transgresses free speech
. In this relation, jurisprudence illumines that "[b]y its nature, 
the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected speech
, 
inevitably almost always under situations not before the court
, that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation. Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being substantially overbroad if the court 
confines itself only to facts 
as applied
 to the litigants
."
[11]
 The 
ponencia
 states that the "overbreadth doctrine finds special application in free speech cases" and "is not used to test the validity of penal laws."
[12]
 I disagree. In the more recent case of 
Nicolas-Lewis v. Commission on Elections
,
[13]
 the Court 
En Banc
 invalidated a penal
[14]
 provision for being overbroad
[15]
 in view of its chilling effect. It explained that while facial invalidation of laws is generally disfavored, its use is justified "to 
avert the 'chilling effect'
 on protected speech,"
[16]
 as in this case. Notably, even indecent speech not amounting to obscenity, may be considered as constitutionally protected depending on the context or the medium of communication.
[17]
 As in the main Decision, the 
ponencia
 refuses to examine Ordinance No. 7780's constitutionality under the lens of the overbreadth doctrine, stating that the subject regulation 
punishes "obscenity" which is not protected speech
.
[18]
 However, with all due respect, I submit that this is misplaced reasoning. It should be borne in mind that in this case, the Court is not asked to examine a material whether it is obscene and therefore unprotected, but rather, 
to evaluate whether or not 
the very parameters used by the Ordinance to determine obscenity itself is constitutionally valid
. Indeed, there is a clear difference between the parameters to determine obscenity from a finding that the material itself is obscene. The former is the very issue in this case and not the latter. As I have explained in my opinion on the main, 
if a statute or ordinance foists unreasonable parameters for obscenity, then it will have the effect of 
sweeping unnecessarily and broadly against protected areas of free speech
 which would have otherwise been deemed as protected under our Constitution
.
[19]
 Thus, since this Court is asked to examine the validity of the obscenity parameters in Ordinance No. 7780, a facial challenge based on the overbreadth doctrine is proper in this case.
 On this score, I join the opinion of Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen that Ordinance No. 7780 is unconstitutional. However, I find it opportune to clarify that Ordinance No. 7780 is regarded as constitutionally infirm 
not because it transgresses the 
Miller
 test 
per se
, but because it 
violates substantive due process
 under an 
"overbreadth" analysis
. As will be briefly explained below, the 
Miller
 test is conceptually different from the overbreadth doctrine.
 The 
Miller
 test is a test to determine if a certain material is obscene; in contrast to the overbreadth doctrine, the 
Miller
 test is not a test to determine an ordinance or law's constitutionality. To be sure, 
Miller
 traces its roots to a rich history of jurisprudence that demonstrates the constant struggle to capture, at its truest form, a reasonable definition of obscenity so as not to impinge on free speech and expression. The ultimate goal is to ensure that protected expression will not be lumped together with unprotected expression and be unduly restrained. Hence, an obscenity regulation that prohibits a wider range of expression than 
Miller
 runs the risk of being overbroad. 
 In 
Fernando v. Court of Appeals
,
[20]
 the Court observed that: 
 
 There is no perfect definition of "obscenity" but the latest word is that of 
Miller v. California
 which established basic guidelines, to wit: (a) whether to the average person, applying contemporary standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
[21]
 
 
 The 
Miller
 test consists of three (3) parameters to determine whether or not a particular material is considered "obscene"; in consequence, if a material is considered obscene, then it can be the subject of government regulation without infringing on the author's freedom of speech and expression. Through these three (3) parameters, the 
Miller
 test aims to define into demonstrable criteria what material may be properly considered as "obscene" under judicial standards, and in so doing, seeks to delimit the conceptual malleability of "obscenity." Practically speaking, a person's appreciation of obscenity may be based on his or her disposition, mores, or values. As such, 
Miller
 is a jurisprudential attempt to set a uniform benchmark for such a highlyÂ­ subjective term as "obscenity."
 Since 
Miller
 is a test to determine what is obscene or not, its proper application is to "zero-in" on the actual material. In this regard, 
Miller
 is not â strictly speaking â the test to determine the constitutionality of a particular ordinance or statute. 
However, this does not mean that the Miller parameters are completely taken out of the equation in constitutional entreaties related to free speech issues
.
 Since 
Miller
 provides the 
prevailing proper standard to determine what is obscene
, an obscenity regulation that 
fails to take into account 
Miller
's three (3) parameters 
effectively foists an overbroad definition of obscenity
 and therefore, 
dangerously suppresses what should have been protected speech or expressions.
 In this case, petitioners argue that the Ordinance's definitions of obscenity and pornography are 
unduly expansive
 as to disregard the guidelines prescribed in 
Miller
. The relevant portions of the Ordinance read:

 To highlight the relevant points, the subject Ordinance criminally punishes the mere "showing, depicting, or describing" "
sexual acts
," "
completely nude human bodies
", and "
human sexual organs or the female breasts
" for being obscene or pornographic. A 
proviso
 exempts these expressions when used for science, scientific research, medical or medicallyÂ­ related art, profession, and for educational purposes. 
 
A perusal of Ordinance No. 7780 reveals that it utterly failed to take the 
Miller
's guidelines into account in defining and penalizing obscenity under the parameters set therein. 
 In particular, 
Miller
's first guideline ("whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest") was exceeded, considering that Ordinance No. 7780 defines the mere depiction of "sexual acts" as obscene without looking at whether the 
dominant theme
 of the work has a tendency to excite lustful thoughts. While the phrase "act calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest" appears in the Ordinance's definition of what is obscene, it is not the sole and definitive factor on what is obscene. Notably, such phrase is qualified by the conjunction "or," which means that it is an alternative to the other four (4) phrases contained in the passage (
i.e
., any material or act that is (1) indecent, erotic, lewd, or offensive; (2) contrary to morals, good customs, or religious beliefs, principles or doctrines; (3) unfit to be seen or heard; or (4) violative of the proprieties of language or behavior, regardless of the motive of the printer, publisher, seller, distributor, performer, or author of such act or material). As such, Ordinance No. 7780 is unduly expansive. 
 Hypothetically therefore, under the Ordinance's definition, a short section in a publication describing a sexual act would be sufficient to penalize the producer even though the effect of the work, taken as a whole, is not to excite the prurient interest. This depiction is a protected expression under 
Miller
. It has long been understood that "sex and obscenity are not synonymous," such that the portrayal of sex, by itself, is not sufficient to deny a material of constitutional protection. However, Ordinance No. 7780 attempts to criminalize such portrayal without any regard as to whether the dominant theme of the material "appeals to the prurient interest" as required by 
Miller
. 
 
Miller
's second guideline â that is, "whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct," was likewise ignored, since the Ordinance disallows even the mere showing of completely nude human bodies, as well as of sexual organs. As unanimously held in 
Jenkins v. Georgia
,
[22]
 the showing of nudity alone does not render a material patently offensive or obscene based on 
Miller
's standards. However, as petitioners point out, a resident of Manila who invites a guest into his home where a nude painting or sculpture is casually displayed, can be held liable under the assailed ordinance.
[23]
 
 Finally, 
Miller
's third guideline (
i.e
., whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious 
literary, artistic, political
, or 
scientific
 value) was disregarded. While the Ordinance contains a 
proviso
 that it shall not apply to materials made or used for "science and scientific research and medical or medically related art, profession, and x x x educational purposes," this 
proviso
 does not include the full range of considerations in 
Miller
 such that those with 
serious literary, artistic, and political value are still considered obscene
. It bears noting that the 
proviso
 exempts art only when it is medically related even though Miller does not contemplate such restrictive appreciation of a material's artistic value. 
 Accordingly, by failing to take into account the 
Miller
 guidelines, whether implicitly or explicitly, in its characterization of what is "obscene," 
the assailed Ordinance unduly sweeps towards protected forms of speech and expression in violation of Section 4
,
[24]
 A
rticle III of the Constitution
. Thus, it violates the overbreadth doctrine. 
In 
Adiong v. Commission on Elections
,
[25]
 the Court has held that "[a] statute is considered void for overbreadth when 'it offends the constitutional principle that a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulations may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."'
[26]
 Notably, the "[o]verbreadth doctrine is a principle of judicial review that a law is invalid if it punishes constitutionally protected speech or conduct along with speech or conduct that the government may limit to further a compelling government interest. A statute that is 
broadly written which deters free expression can be struck down on its face
 because of its 
chilling effect
 even if it also prohibits acts that may legitimately be forbidden."
[27]
 Truly, a facial evaluation of Ordinance No. 7780 reveals its undeniably expansive scope as it prohibits even protected expression.

DISSENTING OPINION
 
 
LEONEN, 
J
.:
 I dissent. 
 An ordinance previously held valid but whose terms are clearly so broad and vague as to easily allow repeated prosecution that will chill both creative and political expression, may still be reviewed by this Court. 
 This case arose from a Petition for Prohibition
[1]
 questioning the constitutionality of Manila Ordinance No. 7780 or the "Anti-Obscenity and Pornography Ordinance of the City of Manila." 
 On February 19, 1993, the City of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 7780
[2]
 which penalizes the printing, publishing, distribution, circulation, sale, production, exhibition, showing, and viewing of obscene and pornographic materials. Ordinance No. 7780 provides: 
 
 SECTION 2. 
Definition of Terms
. â As used in this ordinance, the terms: 
 
 A. Obscene shall refer to any material or act that is indecent, or offensive or erotic, lewd or offensive, or contrary to morals, good customs, or religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, or to any material or act that tends to corrupt or deprive the human mind, or is calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, or is unfit to be seen or heard, or which violates the proprieties of language or behavior, regardless of the motive of the printer, publisher, seller, distributor, performer, or author of such act or material, such as but not limited to: 
 
 Printing, showing, depicting or describing sexual acts; 
 Printing, showing, depicting or describing children in sexual acts; 
 Printing, showing, depicting or describing completely nude human bodies; and
 Printing, showing, depicting or describing the human sexual organs or the female breasts; 
 
 B. Pornographic or pornography shall refer to such objects or subjects of photography, movies, music records, video and VHS tapes, laser discs, billboards, television, magazines, newspapers, tabloids, comics and live shows calculated to excite or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination, regardless of the motive of the author thereof, such as, but not limited to the following: 
 
 Performing live sexual acts in whatever form; 
Those other than live performances showing, depicting or describing sexual acts; 
Those showing, depicting or describing children in sexual acts; 
 Those showing, depicting or describing completely nude human body, or showing, depicting or describing the human sexual organs or the female breasts. 
 
 SECTION 3. 
Prohibited Acts
. The printing, publishing, distribution, circulation, sale, and exhibition of obscene and pornographic acts and materials and the production, public showing and viewing of video and VHS tapes, laser discs, theatrical or stage and other live performances and private showing for public consumption, whether for free or for a fee, of pornographic pictures as herein defined are hereby prohibited within the City of Manila and accordingly penalized as provided herein. 
 
 SECTION 4. 
Penalty Clause
. Any person violating this ordinance shall be punished as follows: 
 
 For the printing, publishing, distribution or circulation of obscene or pornographic materials; the production or showing of obscene movies, television shows, stage and other live performances; for producing or renting obscene videos and VHS tapes, laser discs, for viewing obscene movies, television shows, videos and VHS tapes, laser discs or stage and other live performances; and for performing obscene act on stage and other live performances â imprisonment of one (1) year or fine of five thousand pesos (P5,000.00), or both, at the discretion of the court.
For the selling of obscene or pornographic materials â imprisonment of not less than six (6) months nor more than one (1) year or a fine of not less than one thousand (P1,000.00), nor more than three thousand (P3,000.00) pesos. 
 
 Provided, that in case the offender is a juridical person, the President and the members of the board of directors, shall be held criminally liable; Provided, further, that in case of conviction, all pertinent permits and licenses issued by the City Government to the offender shall be confiscated in favor of the City Government for destruction; Provided, furthermore, that in case the offender is a minor and unemancipated and unable to pay the fine, his parents or guardian shall be liable to pay such fine; Provided, finally, that this ordinance shall not apply to materials printed, distributed, exhibited, sold, filmed, rented, viewed, or produced by reason of or in connection with or in furtherance of science and scientific research and medical or medically related art, profession, and for educational purposes.

 On July 7, 2008, 12 pastors and preachers filed a Joint Complaint-Affidavit
[4]
 before the City Prosecutor's Office of Manila against the officers and publishers of various magazines and tabloids for violation of Articles 200
[5]
 and 201, paragraph 2(a)
[6]
 of the Revised Penal Code, and violation of Ordinance No. 7780. They were led by Pastor Bienvenido M. Abante, Jr., then Representative of the Sixth District of Manila and principal author of Ordinance No. 7780.
[7]
 
 Among those charged were petitioners Allan Madrilejos, Allen Hernandez, Glenda Gil, and Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng who were respectively the editor-in-chief, managing editor, circulation manager, and president of Summit Publications, which publishes FHM Magazine.
[8]
 The criminal case, docketed as I.S. No. 08G-12234, was set for preliminary investigation.
[9]
 The Office of the City Prosecutor created a special panel of prosecutors composed of Lourdes Gatdula, Agnes Lopez, and Hilarion Buban (Gatdula et al.).
[10]
 On September 12, 2008, petitioners filed a Petition for Prohibition with a Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction
[11]
 with this Court against respondents Gatdula et al. seeking to prevent the implementation of the Ordinance on the ground that it is invalid on its face for being patently offensive to the constitutional right to free speech and expression, repugnant to due process and privacy rights, and violative of the principle of separation of church and state. 
 Petitioners later manifested to this Court that I.S. No. 08G-12234 was dismissed with prejudice.
[12]
 However, they argued that the Petition has not yet become moot as they questioned not only the validity of the criminal prosecution against them, but the validity of Ordinance No. 7780 itself. 
 In a September 24, 2019 Decision,
[13]
 this Court dismissed the Petition on the ground of mootness, holding that the issue on the validity of the Ordinance cannot be addressed since it did not undergo a regular appeals process before it was filed with this Court. In particular, petitioners have not satisfied the two requirements in footnote 11 of 
Pormento v. Estrada
[14]
 to warrant a review. The charge against them was "not of such inherently short duration that it will lapse before petitioners are able to see it challenged before a higher prosecutorial authority (i.e., the Department of Justice) or the courts."
[15]
 They "have also failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that they will once again be hailed before the OCP Manila for the same or another violation of Ordinance No. 7780."
[16]
 In their Motion for Reconsideration, petitioners assert that the case has not yet become moot since the issue of the constitutionality of a valid and existing Ordinance subsists. They maintain that both requirements of 
Pormento
 were present in this case, in that the period between the filing and dismissal of I.S. No. 08G-12234 was too short for it to be fully litigated and that the monthly publication of the magazine makes them vulnerable to criminal charges for every month.
[17]
 Petitioners insist that Ordinance No. 7780 was patently unconstitutional and susceptible to a facial challenge since its provisions are overbroad and violate the right to free speech and expression. They state that the Ordinance provides for a definition of "obscene" and "pornography" which disregards the doctrine in 
Miller vs. California
.
[18]
 They assert that the standards set forth in the Ordinance are vague as it uses expansive language for "Pastors and Preachers of different churches in Metro Manila, [who] are not within the class of the 'average person' referred to in [
Miller
], who may be called upon to apply 'contemporary community standards' in order to gauge whether or not a given work can be considered obscene."
[19]
 They maintain that "it is not for ultra-conservatives or extreme liberalists to dictate upon society what they can or should not see or hear. Neither is it the place for militants, fanatics, radicals or traditionalists to determine the same."
[20]
 Petitioners assert that Ordinance No. 7780 is unduly expansive since that it considers as obscene and pornographic the mere printing, showing, depicting, or describing of sexual acts regardless of whether these are "patently offensive" according to the 
Miller
 test.
[21]
 They maintain that the Ordinance "discounts any appreciation of 'whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value' in direct contravention to the 
Miller
 Test."
[22]
 They likewise contend that the ordinance violates their right to due process as the means employed were not reasonably necessary to accomplish its purpose. They allege that the Ordinance imposes criminal liability based on mere membership in a publication's board, regardless of actual involvement in the publication of the contentious material. Considering that their mother corporation Summit Media publishes several magazines other than FHM, they argue that the Ordinance effectively discourages persons from pursuing other legitimate businesses.
[23]
 Petitioners also assert that the Ordinance offends privacy rights as it "intrude[s] into the privacy of one's home with no other purpose than to control individual thought."
[24]
 The majority is now dismissing this Motion for Reconsideration, invoking this Court's constitutional policy of avoidance.
[25]
 It held that petitioners have not "demonstrated any reasonable likelihood that they would be subjected to criminal prosecution under the same Ordinance again."
[26]
 Further, it held that facial challenges cannot be mounted against penal statutes,
[27]
 that obscenity and pornography have always been unprotected speech, and that there should have been a full blown hearing before striking down a legislative enactment, so "all pertinent issues are sufficiently and exhaustively briefed by all indispensable parties."
[28]
 Respectfully, I maintain my dissent. An overbroad provision goes beyond punishing obscenity. It provides an uncontrolled, unbridled, and unregulated warrant to attack and prohibit protected creative speech. It clearly has a chilling effect on the fundamental right to expression contained in Article III, Section 4 of the Constitution: 
 
 SECTION 4. No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.
 
 
 Ordinance No. 7780's broad and expansive language goes beyond punishing obscenity. It should be struck down as unconstitutional.
 
I
 
 The dismissal of the criminal prosecution has not yet rendered the Petition moot. 
 As a general rule, cases which have become moot will no longer be reviewed by this Court. However, this Court "will decide cases, otherwise moot, if: first, there is a grave violation of the Constitution; second, the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; third, when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and fourth, the case is capable of repetition yet evading review."
[29]
 
 Petitioners did not merely assail their criminal prosecution before this Court. They squarely addressed the apparent unconstitutionality of the criminal statute they were being charged under. As petitioners point out, Ordinance No. 7780 is still valid within the City of Manila. The dismissal of the criminal cases against them does not mean that no other person will be penalized under the Ordinance. Its constitutionality, therefore, is an issue that is precisely "capable of repetition, yet evading review." 
 The two requirements in footnote 11 of 
Pormento v. Estrada
[30]
 are likewise present. Due to the short duration of the criminal prosecution, this Court had to pass upon the issue of mootness. Likewise, petitioners publish their magazines monthly. The continuing validity of Ordinance No. 7780 means that petitioners could be subjected to similar criminal charges for every monthly publication. Thus, there is a reasonable likelihood that petitioners could again be criminally charged under the Ordinance. 
 In any case, this Court has not hesitated in passing upon the merits of a case despite it already being rendered moot by subsequent events.
 In 
Nicolas-Lewis v. Commission on Elections
,
[31]
 this Court entertained a petition questioning the prohibition against partisan political activities abroad during the 2019 National and Local Elections even if the petition had already become moot. This Court exercised its power of judicial review on the ground that the questioned provision might have a chilling effect on a citizen's fundamental right to speech, expression, and suffrage.
 In 
Marquez v. Commission on Elections
,
[32]
 petitioner questioned the Commission on Elections' cancellation of his Certificate of for being a nuisance candidate. This Court, while conceding that the case should have been dismissed for mootness since winning candidates have already been proclaimed, still proceeded to rule on the case since the continuing application of the Commission on Elections of its rules on nuisance candidates is capable of repetition, yet evading review.
 Considering that this case is a rare instance to examine a local legislation's effect on constitutional freedoms, it is more prudent for this Court to exercise its power of judicial review to settle the controversy: 
 
 There is no question that the issues being raised affect the public's interest, involving as they do the people's basic rights to freedom of expression, of assembly and of the press. Moreover, the Court has the duty to formulate guiding and controlling constitutional precepts, doctrines or rules. It has the symbolic function of educating the bench and the bar, and in the present petitions, the military and the police, on the extent of the protection given by constitutional guarantees. And lastly, respondents' contested actions are capable of repetition. Certainly, the petitions are subject to judicial review.

II
 
 An opinion in 
Soriano v. Laguardia
[34]
 succinctly provides for a brief history of the test for determining whether a certain material is obscene and how the test was eventually applied in this jurisdiction: 
 
 One of the established exceptions in freedom of expression is speech characterized as obscene. I will briefly discuss obscenity as the majority opinion characterized the subject speech in this case as obscene thereby taking the speech out of the scope of constitutional protection.
 
 The leading test for determining what material could be considered obscene was the famous 
Regina v. Hicklin
 case wherein Lord Cockburn enunciated thus:
 
 
 I think the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall. 
 
 
 Judge Learned Hand, in 
United States v. Kennerly
, opposed the strictness of the Hicklin test even as he was obliged to follow the rule. He wrote:
 
 
 I hope it is not improper for me to say that the rule as laid down, however consonant it may be with mid-Victorian morals, does not seem to me to answer to the understanding and morality of the present time.
 
 
 
Roth v. United States
 laid down the more reasonable and thus, more acceptable test for obscenity: "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest." Such material is defined as that which has "a tendency to excite lustful thoughts," and "prurient interest" as "a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion."
 
 
Miller v. California
 merely expanded the 
Roth
 test to include two additional criteria: "the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and the work, taken as whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." The basic test, as applied in our jurisprudence, extracts the essence of both 
Roth
 and 
Miller
 â that is, whether the material appeals to prurient interest.
[35]
 (Citations omitted)
 
 
 In this case, we are not tasked to determine whether a certain work or publication is obscene. Rather, we are asked to resolve whether a certain local legislation follows the guidelines set by this Court to protect speech and expression.
 While obscenity is considered unprotected speech which may be validly regulated, there must be a prior declaration stating that a certain speech is obscene before it can be regulated. Jurisprudence has yet to accept the idea of any speech or expression that is obscene 
per se
.
 With this, anti-obscenity statutes may still be subjected to a constitutional challenge to determine if they violate certain constitutional freedoms. In this case, petitioners assail the Ordinance for overbreadth, as its language and provisions are unduly expansive and transgress against constitutionally-protected freedoms.
 While penal statutes are generally not subject to facial challenges, petitioners' argument that the provisions of the Ordinance have a chilling effect on protected speech and expression supports a facial challenge against it. As explained by Justice Mendoza in his opinion in 
Estrada v. Sandiganbayan
:
[36]
 
 
 A facial challenge is allowed to be made to a 
vague
 statute and to one which is 
overbroad
 because of possible "chilling effect" upon protected speech. The theory is that "[w]hen statutes regulate or proscribe speech and no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution, the transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression is deemed to justify allowing attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with narrow specificity." The possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that the protected speech of others may be deterred and perceived grievances left to fester because of possible inhibitory effects of overly broad statutes. 
 
 This rationale does not apply to penal statutes. Criminal statutes have general 
in terrorem
 effect resulting from their very existence, and, if facial challenge is allowed for this reason alone, the State may well be prevented from enacting laws against socially harmful conduct. In the area of criminal law, the law cannot take chances as in the area of free speech.
 
 The overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application only to free speech cases. They are inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes. As the U.S. Supreme Court put it, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, "we have not recognized an 'overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment." In 
Broadrick v. Oklahoma
, the Court ruled that "claims of facial overbreadth have been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate only spoken words" and, again, that "overbreadth claims, if entertained at all, have been curtailed when invoked against ordinary criminal laws that are sought to be applied to protected conduct." For this reason, it has been held that "a facial challenge to a legislative Act is ... the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid." As for the vagueness doctrine, it is said that a litigant may challenge a statute on its face only if it is vague in all its possible applications. "A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others."
 
 In sum, the doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth, and vagueness are analytical tools developed for testing "on their faces" statutes in free speech cases or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases. They cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute. With respect to such statute, the established rule is that "one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional." As has been pointed out, "vagueness challenges in the First Amendment context, like overbreadth challenges typically produce facial invalidation, while statutes found vague as a matter of due process typically are invalidated [only] 'as applied' to a particular defendant." Consequently, there is no basis for petitioner's claim that this Court review the Anti-Plunder Law on its face and in its entirety.
[37]

 The void-for-vagueness doctrine holds that a statute may be declared unconstitutional if its provisions are vague such that it fails to "inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties."
[38]
 
 
 A statute or act suffers from the defect of vagueness when it lacks comprehensible standards that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. It is repugnant to the Constitution in two respects: (1) it violates due process for failure to accord persons, especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of the conduct to avoid; and (2) it leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions and becomes an arbitrary flexing of the Government muscle.

 In 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council
,
[40]
 this Court clarified that a vagueness challenge may only be invoked in "as applied" cases.
[41]
 However, 
Disini v. Secretary of Justice
,
[42]
 broadened the scope of facial challenges based on vagueness to include cases where "a penal statute encroaches upon the freedom of speech."
[43]
 The overbreadth doctrine, on the other hand, invalidates statutes which aim to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulations "by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."
[44]
 In applying the overbreadth doctrine the primary criterion "is not whether the case is a freedom of speech case, but rather, whether the case involves an as-applied or a facial challenge."
[45]
 
 
 By its nature, the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected speech, inevitably almost always under situations not before the court, that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation. Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being substantially overbroad if the court confines itself only to facts as applied to the litigants. 
 
 . . . .
 
 In restricting the overbreadth doctrine to free speech claims, the Court, in at least two cases, observed that the US Supreme Court has not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment, and that claims of facial overbreadth have been entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to regulate only spoken words. In 
Virginia v. Hicks
, it was held that rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or speech-related conduct. Attacks on overly broad statutes are justified by the "transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression."
[46]
 (Citations omitted)
 
 
 While both void-for-vagueness and overbreadth doctrines tackle freedom of expression cases, the primary consideration in applying them is still whether the assailed statute violates the fundamental right to due process. Further, the application of the overbreadth doctrine also considers whether the case involves a facial challenge or an "as applied" challenge.
[47]
 Here, petitioners assailed the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 on the ground that its provisions were unduly expansive and encroaches upon protected expression. Thus, the overbreadth doctrine must be applied to determine the validity of Ordinance No. 7780.
 In 
Nicolas-Lewis v. Commission on Elections
,
[48]
 this Court subjected Section 36.8
[49]
 of Republic Act No. 9189,
[50]
 as amended to a facial challenge for being overbroad, as it was alleged that the provision, on its face, violated the right to free speech, expression, and assembly, as well as the right to suffrage. This Court stated: 
 
 Foremost, a facial review of a law or statute encroaching upon the freedom of speech on the ground of overbreadth or vagueness is acceptable in our jurisdiction. Under the overbreadth doctrine, a proper governmental purpose, constitutionally subject to state regulation, may not be achieved by means that unnecessarily sweep its subject broadly, thereby invading the area of protected freedoms. Put differently, an overbroad law or statute needlessly restricts even constitutionally-protected rights. On the other hand, a law or statute suffers from vagueness when it lacks comprehensible standards that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess as its meaning and differ as to its application. 
 
 It is noteworthy, however, that facial invalidation of laws is generally disfavored as its results to entirely striking down the challenged law or statute on the ground that they may be applied to parties not before the Court whose activities are constitutionally protected. It disregards the case and controversy requirement of the Constitution in judicial review, and permits decisions to be made without concrete factual settings and in sterile abstract contexts, deviating thus from the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication. Hence, an on-its-face invalidation of the law has consistently been considered as a "manifestly strong medicine to be used "sparingly and only as a last resort." 
 
 The allowance of a review of a law or statute on its face in free speech cases is justified, however, by the aim to avert the "chilling effect" on protected speech, the exercise of which should not be at all times abridged. The Court elucidated: 
 
 
 The theory that "[w]hen statutes regulate and proscribe speech and no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution, the transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression is deemed to justify allowing attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with narrow specificity.
[51]
 (Citations omitted)
 
 
 
 The question before this Court is whether the enumeration in the Ordinance is so overbroad that it invades the areas of protected freedoms. Otherwise stated, we are asked to resolve whether the statute' on its face, contains provisions that result in a "chilling effect" on constitutionally protected speech and expression. 
 The problem in this case lies on 
how
 to determine if the provisions of the Ordinance are overbroad. To resolve this, resort should be made to more specific tests. For this reason, this Court must apply the 
Miller
 Test, as this is the current and prevailing test within this jurisdiction. 
 In its September 24, 2019 Decision, this Court suggested that the case should have first undergone the appellate process before review by this Court, so that the trial court could rule on the factual issues, adopt the 
Miller
 Test, and receive evidence.
[52]
 However, it must be emphasized that there is no need to make a factual determination of the issues when the mode of analysis to be applied is a facial overbreadth challenge as the constitutionality of the statute is determined "on its face," rather than "as applied," which requires factual antecedence. 
 In recent cases of this Court, it was unnecessary to resolve questions of fact when subsequent events have already rendered the facts moot. 
 In 
Marquez v. Commission on Elections,
[53]
 this Court did not delve into the factual issue of whether petitioner Marquez had the financial capacity to launch a nationwide senatorial campaign since the conduct of the elections already rendered this issue moot. 
 In 
Nicolas-Lewis v. Commission on Elections
,
[54]
 there were no questions of fact to be resolved since there was no allegation that petitioner in that case, a private citizen with dual citizenship, had been campaigning for certain candidates abroad. She merely argued that the questioned provision prevented her from doing so. 
 There are even certain obscenity cases which did not require the conduct of an appellate process before this Court exercised its power of judicial review.
[55]
 
 In 
Gonzalez v. Katigbak
,
[56]
 a petition was filed directly with this Court questioning the resolution of the Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television, which classified the movie 
Kapit sa Patalim
 as "For Adults Only." There was no question raised as to whether the issue should first be resolved by the trial court or whether the trial court should first receive evidence that moviegoers and critics found the movie too obscene for commercial distribution. On the contrary, this Court assumed jurisdiction over the certiorari petition. 
 In 
Soriano v. Laguardia
,
[57]
 this Court did not hesitate to entertain a petition directly filed with this Court assailing decision of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board suspending petitioner from his television program for allegedly uttering obscene words. It was unnecessary that the case be first reviewed by the Court of Appeals before this Court could fully resolve the issues raised by the parties.
 Considering that this case presents a novel issue that is susceptible to a facial challenge on the basis of overbreadth, it is unnecessary to require the parties to complete the criminal prosecution and come to this Court on appeal before we can exercise our power of judicial review. 
 
III
 
 Petitioners argue that Ordinance No. 7780 violates the guidelines in the 
Miller
 Test in that first, its expansive language fails to consider contemporary community standards in its application; second, it considers as obscene certain acts without determining whether it was made in a patently offensive manner; and third, it fails to take into account whether a certain speech, when taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
 The Ordinance considers as "obscene" and therefore, illegal, the following acts or materials: 
 
 A. Obscene shall refer to any material 
or
 act that is indecent, 
or
 offensive 
or
 erotic, lewd or offensive, 
or
 contrary to morals, good customs, or religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, 
or
 to any material or act that tends to corrupt or deprive the human mind, 
or
 is calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, 
or
 is unfit to be seen or heard, 
or
 which violates the proprieties of language or behavior, regardless of the motive of the printer, publisher, seller, distributor, performer, or author of such act or material, such as but not limited to: 
 
 Printing, showing, depicting or describing sexual acts; 
 Printing, showing, depicting or describing children in sexual acts; 
Printing, showing, depicting or describing completely nude human bodies; and 
Printing, showing, depicting or describing the human sexual organs or the female breasts[.]
[58]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 As it is worded, the Ordinance does not take into account contemporary community standards in determining whether a print, show, depiction, or description is considered obscene. It does not define what may be considered "indecent, or offensive or erotic, lewd or offensive, or contrary to morals, good customs, or religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, or to any material or act that tends to corrupt or deprive the human mind, or is calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, or is unfit to be seen or heard, or which violates the proprieties of language or behavior." It encompasses all kinds of behavior without acknowledging what the present standards of the community are.
 The language used by the Ordinance is likewise unduly expansive. It tends to punish every single print, show, depiction, or description of nudity and sex seemingly without distinction. For example, it unnecessarily lumps together eroticism with lewdness, "regardless of the motive of the printer, publisher, seller, distributor, performer, or author." It even singles out the female breast as lewder and more offensive than other sexual organs. 
 Under the 
Miller
 Test, material is obscene if it is "patently offensive." Of the examples listed, only that of child pornography is patently, on its face, offensive. Even without the Ordinance, child pornography would still be illegal under Republic Act No. 9775, or the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009. 
 Under the Ordinance's expansive language, the motive of the author, performer, or publisher is disregarded. Any work that is "indecent, or offensive or erotic, lewd or offensive, or contrary to morals, good customs, or religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, or to any material or act that tends to corrupt or deprive the human mind, or is calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, or is unfit to be seen or heard, or which violates the proprieties of language or behavior" is immediately categorized as obscene. 
 Disregard of the author, performer, or publisher's motives contradicts the last proviso of Section 4 of the Ordinance: 
 
 [T]his ordinance shall not apply to materials printed, distributed, exhibited, sold, filmed, rented, viewed, or produced by reason of or in connection with or in furtherance of science and scientific research and medical or medically related art, profession, and for educational purposes. 
 
 
 An artist may intend for his or her painting to be erotic and still be considered as art. There are instances where artists do not intend for their paintings to be patently offensive. The Ordinance penalizes the artist regardless of the motive. This is an arbitrary restraint on that artist's freedom of expression. 
 The Ordinance also fails to consider whether the materials, when taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
 In disregarding the motives of the printer, publisher, distributor, or seller, the Ordinance makes broad presumptions that an entire publication can only contain obscene material and nothing more. There are certainly instances where parts of the magazine may appeal to prurient interests, but some parts may have serious literary value. Petitioners point out that the alleged offensive magazines featured "literature from award-winning writers such as Marguerite de Leon, Anna Felicia Sanchez and Norman Wilwayco."
[59]
 
 The prohibition in the Ordinance likewise includes materials that are contrary to religious beliefs but does not mention which religion's beliefs it seeks to protect. 
 Article II of the Constitution provides that there shall be an inviolable separation of Church and State.
[60]
 Article III, Section 5 is even more explicit: 
 
 SECTION 5. No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights. 
 
 
 Local legislation that bases its standards of morality on a particular religion only tends to establish a dominant religion, to the exclusion of all other faiths. It may be that certain material is not considered by one particular religion as offensive. One religion may even view human sexuality as part of the religious experience. To arbitrarily create legislation based on the puritanical views of one religion is not merely insensitive; it is unconstitutional. 
 The Ordinance likewise imposes criminal liability on the president and board members of a publication, regardless of whether they were personally involved in the actual publication of the alleged obscene publication. Petitioners' publishing corporation also publishes several other magazines that are not, under the Ordinance's provision, considered obscene. However, because of the Ordinance, the president and the board may be held criminally liable for offenses they may have no personal knowledge of which may prevent them from doing their jobs. This is an arbitrary restraint on their legitimate pursuit of business. 
 The Ordinance does not give due regard to measures that may have been undertaken by the publishing corporation to ensure that only adults, who have full autonomy over all their moral choices, are in possession of the materials. As petitioners point out, "a clear 18+ mark appears prominently on the covers of all FHM magazines, together with the words 'CONTENTS MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR MINORS' . . . [they] are released to distributors sealed in plastic covers, for sale only in legitimate magazine stands and only to adults."
[61]
 
 Measures have already been taken to protect the "unwary consumers," which is less restrictive than the penal provisions provided in the Ordinance. As this Court aptly observed: 
 
 The promotion of public welfare and a sense of morality among citizens deserves the full endorsement of the judiciary provided that such measures do not trample rights this Court is sworn to protect. The notion that the promotion of public morality is a function of the State is as old as Aristotle. The advancement of moral relativism as a school of philosophy does not de-legitimize the role of morality in law, even if it may foster wider debate on which particular behavior to penalize. It is conceivable that a society with relatively little shared morality among its citizens could be functional so long as the pursuit of sharply variant moral perspectives yields an adequate accommodation of different interests. 
 
 To be candid about it, the oft-quoted American maxim that "you cannot legislate morality" is ultimately illegitimate as a matter of law, since as explained by Calabresi, that phrase is more accurately interpreted as meaning that efforts to legislate morality will fail if they are widely at variance with public attitudes about right and wrong. Our penal laws, for one, are founded on age-old moral traditions, and as long as there are widely accepted distinctions between right and wrong, they will remain so oriented. 
 
 Yet the continuing progression of the human story has seen not only the acceptance of the right-wrong distinction, but also the advent of fundamental liberties as the key to the enjoyment of life to the fullest. Our democracy is distinguished from non-free societies not with any more extensive elaboration on our part of what is moral and immoral, but from our recognition that the individual liberty to make the choices in our lives is innate, and protected by the State. Independent and fair-minded judges themselves are under a moral duty to uphold the Constitution as the embodiment of the rule of law, by reason of their expression of consent to do so when they take the oath of office, and because they are entrusted by the people to uphold the law. 
 
 Even as the implementation of moral norms remains an indispensable complement to governance, that prerogative is hardly absolute, especially in the face of the norms of due process of liberty. And while the tension may often be left to the courts to relieve, it is possible for the government to avoid the constitutional conflict by employing more judicious, less drastic means to promote morality.
[62]
 
 
 
 The alleged legislative intent of the Ordinance was to eradicate greed, "which preys on and appeals [to] the baser instincts of unwary consumers."
[63]
 This purpose being "far superior to the 'property rights' of the petitioners in the hierarchy of values within the due process clause."
[64]
 
 However, in achieving this, the local government of Manila made an unnecessary intrusion into the private rights of its citizens based on its own pre-determined standard of morality. Whatever baser instinct an adult consumer may have is not for local government to legislate. Consumers may buy the publications not merely to satisfy their prurient curiosity but because the publication actually contains serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The State cannot likewise interfere if they, who have complete autonomy over their morals and choices, choose to buy these publications for prurient reasons. 
 Neither the State nor this Court can attempt to legislate morality. Ordinance No. 7780 does not penalize mere possession of obscene material; it relies heavily on inserting perceived values into each individual's thoughts. 
 While this Court is granted the discretion to decide what is and what is not obscene, standards for determination must be done on a case-to-case basis and must evolve over time. Any legislation passed, whether local or national, that seeks to restrain the free exercise of speech and expression must be stricken down.

DISSENTING OPINION
 
 
CAGUIOA, 
J
.:
 
 After a careful re-evaluation of the merits of the instant case, aided by the sharp Dissenting Opinion of Senior Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe, I am now reconsidering my vote in the main Decision.
[1]
 
 To recall, the dismissal of the petition in the main Decision was hinged on two grounds: (1) the dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioners for violation of Manila Ordinance No. 7780
[2]
 has rendered the case moot and academic; and (2) Ordinance No. 7780, an anti-obscenity law, cannot be facially attacked on the ground of overbreadth because obscenity is unprotected speech. On the first ground, the main Decision held that a justiciable controversy has ceased to exist with the dismissal of the charge against petitioners for violation of Ordinance No. 7780, as well as the dismissal with prejudice of the criminal case filed against them for violation of Article 201(3)
[3]
 of the Revised Penal Code. While acknowledging several exceptions to the moot and academic doctrine laid down in various jurisprudence over the years, the main Decision zeroed in on the inapplicability of one of the exceptions, which was the "capable of repetition, yet evading review." The discussion on the evolution of this principle being sound and exhaustive notwithstanding, upon my re-assessment of the issues in this case, I submit that the Court should not have felt precluded from taking cognizance of the case despite the dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioners. I join Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe's observation that with petitioners also questioning the validity of the Ordinance, there remains a live controversy which is ripe for adjudication. 
 The dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioners did not strip their petition before the Court of the requirement of actual case or controversy in judicial review. "[A]n actual case or controversy is one which 'involves a 
conflict of legal rights
, an assertion of 
opposite legal claims
, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute.' In other words, 'there must be a 
contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted and enforced on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence
."'
[4]
 In relation to this requirement, the case must also be ripe for adjudication. A question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it. It is a prerequisite that something has then been accomplished or performed by either the executive or legislative branch before a court may come into the picture, and petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself or herself as a result of the challenged action. He or she must show that he or she has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of the act complained of.
[5]
 In 
Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr
.
[6]
 (
Imbong
), the Court rejected the arguments of the proponent of the Reproductive Health Law (RH Law) or Republic Act No. (R.A.) 10354
[7]
 that the petitions did not present any actual case or controversy because the RH Law has yet to be implemented, no one has been charged with violating any of its provisions, and that there was no showing that any of petitioners' rights has been adversely affected by its operation. In finding that there was, on the contrary, an actual case or controversy that was ripe for judicial determination, the Court explained: 
 
 In this case, the Court is of the view 
that an actual case or controversy exists and that the same is ripe for judicial determination
. Considering that the RH Law and its implementing rules have already taken effect and that budgetary measures to carry out the law have already been passed, it is evident that the subject petitions present a justiciable controversy. As stated earlier, when an action of the legislative branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it not only becomes a right, but also a duty of the Judiciary to settle the dispute. 
 
 Moreover, the petitioners have shown that the case is so because medical practitioners or medical providers are in danger of being criminally prosecuted under the RH Law for vague violations thereof, particularly 
public health officers
 who are 
threatened to be dismissed from the service with forfeiture of retirement and other benefits
. They must, at least, be heard on the matter 
NOW
.
[8]
 (Emphasis in the original)
 
 
 
Imbong
 relied on the case of 
The Province of North Cotabato v. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines Peace Panel on Ancestral Domain (GRP)
,
[9]
 where the Court ruled that the fact of the law or act in question being not yet effective does not negate ripeness. Concrete acts under a law are not necessary to render the controversy ripe. Even a singular violation of the Constitution and/or the law is enough to awaken judicial duty.
[10]
 Similarly, in 
Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK) v. Quezon City
[11]
 (
SPARK
), which involved an original Petition for 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition before the Court assailing the constitutionality of the curfew ordinances issued by the local governments of Quezon City, Manila, and Navotas, the Court found the existence of an actual justiciable controversy in the case in this wise: 
 
 x x x [T]his Court finds that there exists an actual justiciable controversy in this case given the evident clash of the parties' legal claims, particularly on whether the Curfew Ordinances impair the minors' and parents' constitutional rights, and whether the Manila Ordinance goes against the provisions of RA 9344. Based on their asseverations, petitioners have â as will be gleaned from the substantive discussions below â conveyed a 
prima facie
 case of grave abuse of discretion, which perforce impels this Court to exercise its expanded jurisdiction. The case is likewise ripe for adjudication, considering that the Curfew Ordinances were being implemented until the Court issued the TRO enjoining their enforcement. The purported threat or incidence of injury is, therefore, not merely speculative or hypothetical but rather, real and apparent.
[12]
 
 
 
 Applying the foregoing cases here, there remains an actual case or controversy with the continued presence of Ordinance No. 7780. Not having been struck down and declared void, the Ordinance remains good law. As in 
SPARK
, there is, in this case, an "evident clash of the parties' legal claims," particularly on whether the Ordinance is violative of the constitutional rights of petitioners and of others who are similarly situated like them. Evidently, this issue is purely legal and therefore does not require the presence of prevailing, concrete, or overt facts before the Court may be taken to task to adjudicate. 
 On this score, I further concur with Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe's position that there remains a practical legal value to judicially pass upon the facial challenge posed by petitioners against Ordinance No. 7780. Specifically, petitioners filed the case on the ground that it is "invalid on its face for being patently offensive to their constitutional right to free speech and expression, repugnant to due process and privacy rights, and violative of the constitutionally established principle of separation of church and state."
[13]
 As will be further discussed below, the chilling effect of the overbroad provisions of the Ordinance on the exercise of the fundamental freedom of speech and expression warrants the judicial review of the Court. As a matter of fact, by this very reason, the facial challenge can prosper even without further facts that usually animate an actual case or controversy. 
 In 
Romualdez v. Sandiganbayan,
[14]
 the Court explained why facial invalidation is generally disfavored and employed sparingly and as a last resort in facial challenges involving penal statutes. The concern was that an "on-its-face" invalidation of statutes would result in a mass acquittal of parties whose cases may not have even reached the courts. Such invalidation would constitute a departure from the usual requirement of "actual case and controversy" and permit decisions to be made in a sterile abstract context having no factual concreteness.
[15]
 
 Subsequently in 
Imbong
, the Court, veering away from the restrictive application of facial challenges to strictly penal statutes, held that it has expanded the scope of facial challenges to cover statutes not only regulating free speech, 
but also those involving religious freedom, and other fundamental rights in a modified approach from that of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS)
. The Court elucidated that unlike its counterpart in the U.S., its expanded jurisdiction under the Constitution mandates it to not only settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. The Court then concluded that the framers of our Constitution envisioned a proactive Judiciary, ever vigilant with its duty to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution.
[16]
 Verily, the Court expounded on the requirement of justiciable controversy and notably held that 
to dismiss the petitions before it on the "
simple expedient that there exist(s) no actual case or controversy
, would diminish this Court as a reactive branch of government, acting only when the Fundamental Law has been transgressed, to the detriment of the Filipino people
."
[17]
 
 Insofar as overbreadth is concerned, in particular, the explanation of the Court on the necessity to apply a facial type of invalidation in 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council
[18]
 (
Southern
 
Hemisphere
) which was later reiterated in 
SPARK
, bears emphasis. The discussion, albeit done in the context of third-party standing, is consonant and closely related with the principle of actual case or controversy. 
Southern Hemisphere
 instructed that, 
by its nature, the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected speech, inevitably almost always 
under situations not before the court
, that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation. Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being substantially overbroad if the court confines itself only to facts as applied to the litigants
.
[19]
 The Court expounded on this "exception to some of the usual rules of constitutional litigation" and to the factor that motivates the departure, to wit: 
 
 "The most distinctive feature of the overbreadth technique is that it marks an exception to some of the usual rules of constitutional litigation. Ordinarily, a particular litigant claims that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him or her; if the litigant prevails, the courts carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law by invalidating its improper applications on a case to case basis. Moreover, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests. 
In overbreadth analysis, those rules give way; challenges are permitted to raise the rights of third parties; and the court invalidates the entire statute "on its face," not merely "as applied for" so that the overbroad law becomes unenforceable until a properly authorized court construes it more narrowly. 
The factor that motivates courts to depart from the normal adjudicatory rules is the concern with the "chilling;" deterrent effect of the overbroad statute on third parties not courageous enough to bring suit. The Court assumes that an overbroad law's "very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression." 
An overbreadth ruling is designed to remove that deterrent effect on the speech of those third parties
.
" x x x
[20]
 (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied; underscoring in the original omitted)
 
 
 Hence, under pain of repetition, the continued effectivity of Ordinance No. 7780, which has overbroad provisions that infringe on freedom of speech and expression, should impel the Court to take cognizance of the facial challenge by petitioners despite the dismissal of the criminal charges against them. True, it has been pointed out that "procedures for testing the constitutionality of a statue 'on its face' xx x are fundamentally at odds with the function of courts in our constitutional plan."
[21]
 When an accused is guilty of conduct that can constitutionally be prohibited and that the State has endeavored to prohibit, the State should be able to inflict its punishment. Such punishment violates no personal right of the accused.
[22]
 
I submit, however, that this precept should never remain unbending when
 
fundamental rights are violated by a law. 
In such cases, it cannot be gainsaid that the legislature has repudiated its duty to uphold the Constitution.
[23]
 It becomes the Court's duty then not to reward or accommodate the legislature's failure, but to protect individual rights from it.
[24]
 Complete, pre-enforcement invalidation of the law in such circumstances satisfies constitutional norms and vindicates the courts' critical role in protecting individual rights from majority oppression.
[25]
 The main Decision dismissed the petition also on the ground that petitioners cannot mount a facial challenge against Ordinance No. 7780 because it is a penal statute proscribing obscenity, which is unprotected speech. Again, on reconsideration, I now demur from this restrictive interpretation. 
 Indeed, what has been often repeated in cases involving the constitutionality of a penal law is the observations of former Associate Justice Vicente V. Mendoza adopted in the 
ponencia
 of 
Estrada v. Sandiganbayan
[26]
 (
Estrada
). Ruling on whether the allegations that the Plunder Law is vague and overbroad justify a facial review of the law's validity, Justice Mendoza answered in the negative. He concluded that the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines have special application only to free speech cases and are inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes.
[27]
 The challenge is allowed because of the possible "chilling effect" upon protected speech. This possibility outweighs the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished, a rationale that, according to Justice Mendoza, does not apply to penal statutes. Criminal statutes have general 
in terrorem
 effect resulting from their very existence, and, if facial challenge is allowed for this reason alone, the State may well be prevented from enacting laws against socially harmful conduct. In the area of criminal law, the law cannot take chances as in the area of free speech.
[28]
 However, in his opinion in the resolution of the motion for reconsideration in 
Estrada
, Justice Mendoza clarified the observations he made in the main 
ponencia
, to wit: 
 
 Before discussing these cases, let it be clearly stated that, when we said that "the doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth and vagueness are analytical tools for testing 'on their faces' statutes in free speech cases or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases [and therefore] cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute," we did not mean to suggest that the doctrines do not apply to criminal statutes at all. They do, although they do not justify a facial challenge, but only an as-applied challenge, to those statutes. Parties can only challenge such provisions of the statutes as applied to them. 
Neither did we mean to suggest that the doctrines justify facial challenges only in free speech or First Amendment cases. 
To be sure, they also justify facial challenges in cases under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution with respect to so-called "fundamental rights." 
In short, a facial challenge1 as distinguished from as-applied challenge, may be made on the ground that, because of vagueness or overbreadth, a statute has a chilling effect on freedom of speech or religion or other fundamental rights
. But the doctrines cannot be invoked to justify a facial challenge to statute where no interest of speech or religion or fundamental freedom is involved, as when what is being enforced is an ordinary criminal statute like the Anti-Plunder law.
[29]
 (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied) 
 
 
 Later, the Dissenting Opinion of former Associate Justice Dante O. Tinga in 
Spouses Romualdez v. Commission on Elections
[30]
 pointed out that "[i]n light of Justice Mendoza's subsequent clarification, 
it is a disputable matter whether 
Estrada
 established a doctrine that 'void-for-vagueness or overbreadth challenges do not apply to penal statutes.
'"
[31]
 The foregoing interpretation on the application of facial challenges to penal statutes made by Justice Mendoza and Justice Tinga is, I submit, the correct position. The nature of the assailed law should not be controlling â rather, what should be key is whether fundamental rights or freedoms can be demonstrated to have been implicated by the law. To once again take a cue from the clarificatory opinion of Justice Mendoza in 
Estrada
: 
 
 x x x For the question in the case at bar, it cannot be overemphasized, is not whither (sic) the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines apply to facial challenges to criminal statutes. The question rather is whether the mere assertion that a penal statute is vague or overbroad â without a showing that interests of speech (or, it may be added, freedom of religion) or other fundamental rights are infringed â triggers a facial review of the said statutes, using strict scrutiny as the standard of judicial review. We hold it does not. 
 
 As the Anti-Plunder Law implicates neither free speech nor freedom of religion or other fundamental rights of petitioner, a facial review of the law cannot be required nor the burden of proving its validity placed on the State. Mere assertions that it is vague or overbroad only justify an "as-applied" review of its challenged-provisions. x x x
[32]
 
 
 
 Hence, to deny a facial attack on Ordinance No. 7780 on the basis alone that it is a penal statute would foreclose a prompt examination by the Court on whether it truly impinges on constitutionally protected speech and expression. Moreover, to await an as-applied challenge would render, in the meantime, petitioners and those who are similarly situated like them, to exist in uncertainty about the limits of Ordinance No. 7780. Excessive uncertainty, however, about the limits of a criminal law can chill even innocent expression.
[33]
 
 
Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union
[34]
 (
Reno
) is instructive. At issue in said case was the constitutionality of two statutory provisions under the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) enacted to protect minors from "indecent" and "patently offensive" communications on the Internet. Notwithstanding the legitimacy and importance of the congressional goal of protecting children from harmful materials, 
Reno
 held that the CDA abridges "the freedom of speech" protected by the First Amendment because it effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another. Ruling in favor of the facial invalidation of the CDA, the concern in 
Reno
 included, in fact, the punitive nature of the law: 
 
 The vagueness of the CDA is a matter of special concern for two reasons. First, the CDA is a content-based regulation of speech. The vagueness of such a regulation raises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech. See, 
e.g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nev
., 501 U. S. 1030, 1048-1051 (1991). 
Second, the CDA is a criminal statute. In addition to the opprobrium and stigma of a criminal conviction, the CDA threatens violators with penalties including up to two years in prison for each act of violation. The severity of criminal sanctions may well cause speakers to remain silent rather than communicate even arguably unlawful words, ideas, and images.
 See, 
e.g., Dombrowski v. Pfister
, 380 U. S. 479, 494 (1965). As a practical matter, this increased deterrent effect, coupled with the "risk of discriminatory enforcement" of vague regulations, poses greater First Amendment concerns than those implicated by the civil regulation reviewed in 
Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC
, 518 U. S. 727 (1996).
[35]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 Furthermore, to ban altogether and unqualifiedly a facial attack against a penal statute that professedly aims to regulate obscenity is quite dangerous. Obscenity is, indeed, outside the mantle of protection of protected speech and expression. 
But it is also true that its definition has consistently been regarded as a term that eludes precise definition, so much so that the SCOTUS' logic of what makes frank depictions and descriptions of sex dangerous has fluctuated wildly from case to case.
[36]
 
 Over time, the consensus that has developed is to confine the definition of obscenity to the unduly dangerous and morally corrupting expression.
[37]
 To clearly set out this delimitation, the SCOTUS, in the leading case of 
Miller v. California
[38]
 (
Miller
), established basic guidelines which remain relevant to this day. These are: (a) whether to the average person, applying contemporary standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appealing to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
[39]
 Significantly, in our jurisdiction, this Court has recognized that the latest word on the definition of obscenity is that of 
Miller
,
[40]
 and has applied its "contextual lessons" in deciding what constitutes obscenity.
[41]
 Simply put, the 
Miller
 guidelines were set out to define and circumscribe what obscene is from what is not. In this case, the provisions of Ordinance No. 7780 have overstepped the 
Miller
 guidelines and the chilling effect presented by this overbreadth is unmistakable. The relevant portion of Ordinance No. 7780 reads in part: 
 
 
Sec. 2. Definition of Terms:
 As used in this ordinance, the terms: 
 
 A. 
Obscene
 shall refer to any material or act that is indecent, erotic, lewd or offensive, or contrary to morals, good customs or religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, or to any material or act that tends to corrupt or deprive the human mind, or is calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, or is unfit to be seen or heard, or which violates the proprieties of language or behavior, regardless of the motive of the printer, publisher, seller, distributor, performer or author of such act or material, such as but not limited to: 
 
 1. Printing, showing, depicting or describing sexual acts; 
 
 2. Printing, showing, depicting or describing children in sexual acts; 
 
 3. Printing, showing, depicting or describing completely nude human bodies; and
 
 4. Printing, showing, depicting or describing the human sexual organs or the female breasts. 
 
 B. 
Pornographic or pornography
 shall refer to such objects or subjects of photography, movies, music records, video and VHS tapes, laser discs, billboards, television, magazines, newspapers, tabloids, comics and live shows calculated to excite or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination, regardless of the motive of the author thereof, such as but not limited to the following: 
 
 1. Performing live sexual acts in whatever form; 
 
2. Those other than live performances showing, depicting or describing sexual acts; 
 
 3. Those showing, depicting or describing children in sex acts; 
 
 4. Those showing, depicting or describing completely nude human body, or showing, depicting or describing the human sexual organs or the female breasts. 
 
 C. Materials shall refer to magazines, newspapers, tabloids, comics, writings, photographs, drawings, paintings, billboards, decals, movies, music records, video and VHS tapes, laser discs, and similar matters. 
 
 
Sec. 3. Prohibited Acts
[:] The printing, publishing, distribution, circulation, sale and exhibition of obscene and pornographic acts and materials and the production, public showing and viewing of video and VHS tapes, laser discs, theatrical or stage and other live performances and private showing for public consumption, whether for free or for a fee, of pornographic pictures as herein defined are hereby prohibited within the City of Manila and accordingly penalized as provided herein. 
 
 
Sec. 4. Penalty Clause:
 Any person violating this ordinance shall be punished as follows: 
 
 x x x x
 
 Provided, that in case the offender is a juridical person, the President and the members of the board of directors, shall be held criminally liable; Provided, further, that in case of conviction, all pertinent permits and licenses issued by the City of Government to the offender shall be confiscated in favor of the City Government for destruction; Provided, furthermore, that in case the offender is a minor and unemancipated and unable to pay the fine, his parents or guardian shall be liable to pay such fine; provided, finally, that this ordinance shall not apply to materials printed, distributed, exhibited, sold, filmed, rented, viewed, or produced by reason of or in connection with or in furtherance of science and scientific research and medical or medically related art, profession, and for educational purposes. 
 
 
 As summarized by Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe, the Ordinance criminally punishes the mere "showing, depicting, or describing" of "
sexual acts
," "
completely nude human bodies
," and "
human sexual organs or the female breasts
" for being obscene or pornographic. These materials or acts are not so narrowly tailored as to what the 
Miller
 guidelines define as unprotected speech and expression. Specifically, the definitions of obscenity and pornography under the Ordinance lack the elements of 
appealing to prurient interest when taken as a whole and of being a patently offensive depiction or description of sexual conduct
. Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe aptly observes that while the definition of obscenity includes the phrase 
calculated to excite impure imagination or arouse prurient interest
 (or 
calculated to excite or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination
 in pornography), it is only one of the factors to be considered in determining what is obscene under the Ordinance. Equally important, the dominant theme of the work is completely disregarded. This absence is crucial because material appealing to the prurient interest or having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts is confined to that which appeals to shameful or morbid interests in sex and excludes as obscene material that provokes only normal, healthy sexual desires.
[42]
 
 In the same vein, the materials and acts sought to be punished do not fall within 
being patently offensive depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct
. In 
Jenkins v. Georgia
[43]
 (
Jenkins
), the SCOTUS recounted on the pains it took in 
Miller
 to "'give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced,' that is, the requirement of patent offensiveness."
[44]
 These examples, 
Jenkins
 further held, included "representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated," and "representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals."
[45]
 
Jenkins
 explained that while this did not purport to be an exhaustive catalog of what juries might find patently offensive, it was certainly intended to fix substantive constitutional limitations, deriving from the First Amendment, on the type of material subject to such a determination.
[46]
 In reversing the conviction of the appellant for showing an allegedly obscene film in a movie theater,
[47]
 
Jenkins
' disquisition on why the standard of 
being patently offensive depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct
 is important in determining obscenity is illuminating: 
 
 Our own viewing of the film satisfies us that "Carnal Knowledge" could not be found under the 
Miller
 standards to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Nothing in the movie falls within either of the two examples given in 
Miller
 of material which may constitutionally be found to meet the "patently offensive" element of those standards, nor is there anything sufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment. While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including "ultimate sexual acts" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes. 
There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene under the 
Miller
 standards.
 
 
 Appellant's showing of the film "Carnal Knowledge" is simply not the "public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake and for the ensuing commercial gain" which we said was punishable in 
Miller. Id
., at 35. We hold that the film could not, as a matter of constitutional law be found to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and that it is therefore not outside the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it is obscene. No other basis appearing in the record upon which the judgment of conviction can be sustained, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia.
[48]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 Finally, it may be argued that the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 may be saved by its 
proviso
 which exempts from the definition of obscenity materials printed, distributed, exhibited, sold, filmed, rented, viewed, or produced 
by reason of or in connection with or in furtherance of science and scientific research and medical or medically-related art, profession, and for educational purposes
. This 
proviso
, however, is utterly incomplete in what 
Miller
 requires, that is, 
whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value
. Consequently, as again correctly observed by Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe, those with serious literary, artistic, and political value are still considered obscene under the Ordinance. I hasten to add that the problem with overbreadth cannot be saved by simply reading or interpreting the 
proviso
 to nonetheless include these textually excluded values, considering that the definitions of obscenity and pornography under the Ordinance contain the express clause 
regardless of the motive
 of the printer, publisher, seller, distributor, performer or author of the act or material
. 
 Notably, the third standard in 
Miller
 is an evolution of the "value" element in U.S. obscenity cases. The exclusion of obscenity from the protection of the First Amendment began on a mere assumption that it was 
utterly without redeeming social importance
 in 
Roth v. United States
.
[49]
 Later, the element was expressly incorporated as a component into the obscenity test for the first time in 
Memoirs v. Massachusetts
[50]
 (
Memoirs
). It bears to stress that 
Memoirs
 held that the work remains constitutionally protected even if it appeals to prurient interests or is patently offensive, so long as it has social value. The social value of the work can neither be weighed against nor canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness. Subsequently, in 
Miller
, the "value" element was drastically recast. The test of 
utterly without redeeming social value
 articulated in 
Memoirs
 was rejected as a constitutional standard and in its stead, the test now is "
whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value
."
[51]
 As with the first guideline, the dominant theme of the work is similarly taken into consideration, with the end in view of limiting obscenity to materials that depict or describe patently offensive "hard core" sexual conduct and, at the same time, remaining sensitive to any infringement of genuinely serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific expression.
[52]
 
 All told, the continued presence of Ordinance No. 7780, which is, on its face, overbroad, justifies the Court's judicial review. The mere fact that a statutory regulation of speech was enacted for the important purpose of curbing obscenity does not foreclose inquiry into its validity.
[53]
 That inquiry embodies an "overarching commitment" to make sure that Congress has designed its statute to accomplish its purpose "without imposing an unnecessarily great restriction on speech."
[54]
 Certainly, while obscenity is outside the realm of protected speech and may therefore be a proper subject of regulation by the local government of Manila, the regulation may not be done by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and invade the area of the cherished and protected freedom of speech and expression.
[55]
 To reiterate, what is obscene has been carefully defined under the prevailing guidelines set forth in 
Miller
, which this Court has likewise recognized and adhered to. What is outside or excluded from this definition merits the protection of the Constitution, even if such material is of a sexually provocative nature. To be sure, sex and obscenity are not synonymous,
[56]
 and it is likewise well-settled that all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance generally have the full protection of the Constitution.
[57]
 Hence, regulations that aim to restrict or stifle materials and acts falling outside of the limiting definition established in 
Miller
 must be guarded against, lest the guaranteed freedom of speech and expression is deprived of the breathing space it needs to survive.
[58]
 
 In view of the foregoing, I vote to 
GRANT
 the motion for reconsideration of petitioners and to declare Ordinance No. 7780 
VOID
 and 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

 3. Those who shall sell, give away or exhibit films, prints, engravings, sculptures, or literature which are offensive to morals. 
 
 
 On the other hand, the pertinent portions of Ordinance No. 7780 read:

. (Emphases supplied.) 
 
 
 Meantime, the Office of the City Prosecutor formed a panel of prosecutors to conduct the preliminary investigation. While it was ongoing, petitioners filed the present petition which, in the words of the 
ponencia
 of Honorable Associate Justice Francis H. Jardeleza (now retired) is premised "on the ground that Ordinance No. 7780 is 
invalid on its face
 for being patently offensive to their constitutional right to free speech and expression, repugnant to due process and privacy rights, and violative of the constitutionally established principle of separation of church and state." 
 In so many words, petitioners themselves described the present petition as both an 
as-applied
 and a 
facial 
challenge to the validity of Ordinance No. 7780.
[1]
 Petitioners prayed for a writ of prohibition restraining the conduct of the preliminary investigation 
and
 a declaration nullifying the Ordinance and enjoining its implementation. 
 As aptly summarized in the 
ponencia
, petitioners
 particularized
 their 
as-applied
 and
 facial
 challenge to the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 by - 
 
 x x x alleging that [Ordinance No. 7780] defines the terms "obscene" and "pornography" in such a way that 
a very broad range of speech and expression are placed beyond the protection of the Constitution
, thus violating the constitutional guarantee to free speech and expression. 
Specifically, petitioners take issue with the "expansive" language
 of Ordinance No. 7780 
which
, petitioners claim, 
paved the way for complainants, a group of pastors and preachers, to impose their view
 of what is "unfit to be seen or heard" and "violate[s] the proprieties of language and behavior."
[2]
 x x x Petitioners' arguments are facial attacks against Ordinance No. 7780 on the ground of overbreadth.
 
 x x x x
 
 
 The Office of the City Prosecutor filed its own Comment on the petition 
arguing in the strongest terms possible in favor of the constitutionality of the assailed Ordinance
. 
 Meanwhile, the Office of the City Prosecutor issued Resolution dated June 25, 2013 dismissing the charges for violation of Article 200 and Ordinance No. 7780 but ordering the filing of an Information for violation of Article 201 (3) of the RPC. The pertinent portion of the Resolution, as quoted in the 
ponencia
, reads: 
 
 x x x x
 
 If the act or acts of the offender are punished under another article of the Revised Penal Code, Article 200 is not applicable. Considering that the subject matter of the complaint is the obscene publication under Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code, [petitioners] should not be liable for Grave Scandal; hence, the complaint for Grave Scandal should be dismissed.
 
 On the other hand, considering that the subject matter covered by the city ordinance of Manila is likewise the printing, publication, sale, distribution and exhibition of obscene and pornographic acts and materials, it is already absorbed in Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code and the complaint for violation of the city ordinance should likewise be dismissed.
 
 x x x x
 
 Any person who has something to do with the printing, publication, circulation and sale of the obscene publications should be made liable. Hence, except for respondents Eugenio Lopez III, who was charged being the Chairman of the Board of ABS-CBN Publishing, Inc., Ernesto M. Lopez, being the President of the said publishing company, Lance Y. Gokongwei and Lisa Y. Gokongwei-Cheng, being the Chairman of the Board and President, respectively of Summit Publishing, their actual knowledge, consent, and/or participation in the obscene publications not having been clearly established by the evidence, said respondents should not be made liable thereto. However, all the other respondents being persons responsible for the publication, circulation and sale of the subject obscene publications should be made liable thereto.
 
 All the other respondents, either being the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Director, General Manager or Circulation Manager of their respective publishing companies should be made liable for Violation of Section 201 paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code.
 
 x x x x 
 
 
 The criminal case against petitioners for violation of Article 201 (3) of the RPC was docketed Criminal Case No. 13-30084 and raffled to Branch 16 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), City of Manila. 
 The 
ponencia
 further recounted: "Despite the 
dismissal of the charge for violation of Ordinance No. 7780
, petitioners 
did not move to withdraw the present action, adamant that the Ordinance 'violates the constitutional guarantees to free speech and expression
, violates the right to due process, and offends privacy rights." (Emphasis supplied.) 
 Back to Criminal Case No. 13-30084, the same was ordered dismissed with prejudice, upon petitioners' motion on account of the People's failure to prosecute.
 
THE COURT'S RULING
 
 The 
ponencia
 dismissed the present petition on the following grounds: 
 
 
 
(1)
 
The dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioners for violation of the provisions of Ordinance No. 7780 has rendered this case moot and academic.
 
 
 
 
One
. The 
ponencia
 
characterized
 the present petition as one "for prohibition with prayer for the 
issuance of a preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order
, seeking to 
prevent respondents
 from carrying out the
 preliminary investigation
 of the criminal complaint entitled 
Abante, et al. v. Asumbrado, et al.
, docketed as I.S. No. 08G-12234, 
on the ground
 that Ordinance No. 7780 is 
unconstitutional
." This 
characterization
 is clarified by the 
ponencia
's understanding of the petition's 
sole thrust
, which " ... was
 to stop the conduct of the preliminary investigation
 into their alleged violation of an unconstitutional statute â a process that concludes with an Order whether or not to indict petitioners," and inferentially, of the 
unconstitutionality
 of Ordinance No. 7780 as a 
tool
 meant 
merely to terminate
 the preliminary investigation of the criminal complaint against petitioners. Therefore, as the 
ponencia
 ruled, with the 
dismissal
 on preliminary investigation of the complaint for 
violation of the Ordinance
 (along with Article 200 of the RPC) and during the trial of the criminal case for violation of Article 201 (3) of the RPC, it 
should follow
 that the 
outcome of the present petition
 as to the 
unconstitutionality
 of the Ordinance would have 
no practical use or value
 to petitioners.
 
 
Two
. The 
ponencia
 defined a 
"moot and academic case"
 as "one that 
ceases to present a justiciable controversy
 by virtue of supervening events, so that a 
declaration
 thereon would be of 
no practical use or value
." A 
moot case lacks "actual controversies
 involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable x x x" without which courts have 
no jurisdiction
 to act.
 The 
ponencia
, however, did 
not
 explain (at least in this section) why an actual controversy 
had ceased
 to exist after the dismissal of the criminal case and why the 
declaration
 sought by petitioners would have 
no
 practical use or value to them or those similarly situated. 
Instead, the 
ponencia
 went on to explain why the 
exception
 to the general rule that this Court 
should decline
 to act upon 
moot
 cases â 
the case is capable of repetition yet evading review
. 
 The 
ponencia
 explained that this exception has 
two (2) requisites
: 
(1)
 the challenged action was 
in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to
 its cessation or expiration, and
 (2)
 there was a 
reasonable expectation
 that 
the same complaining party
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
. The 
ponencia
 ruled that neither of these requisites applied to the present petition.
 The 
ponencia
 held that the 
preliminary investigation
 which the present petition sought to stop did 
not 
involve a 
very short duration
: 
 
 In this case, it must be noted that petitioners' purpose in filing the present action was to stop the conduct of the preliminary investigation into their alleged violation of an unconstitutional statute â a process that concludes with an Order whether or not to indict petitioners. 
Relatedly, and as it happened in this case, such an Order, if and when issued, is not of such inherently short duration that it will lapse before petitioners are able to see it challenged before a higher prosecutorial authority (
i.e
., the Department of Justice) or the courts
. In fact, and unless reversed by the Secretary of Justice or by the courts, 
an order to indict does not lapse
. Thus,
 the time constraint
 that justified the application of the exception in 
Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC
[3]
 (two-year validity of an Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) cease and desist order) and 
Roe v. Wade
[4]
 (266-day human gestation period) 
does not exist here
.
 
 
 It also ruled that there was 
no reasonable expectation
 that 
petitioners
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
 because: 
 
 x x x when 
the criminal charges against petitioners were dismissed with prejudice, they can no longer be refiled
 without offending the constitutional proscription against double jeopardy. Petitioners have 
also failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that they will once again be hailed
 before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila (OCP) for the same or another violation of Ordinance No. 7780. It should be noted that 
the OCP Manila did not even question the dismissal
 of the case. There is likewise 
no showing that the pastors and preachers who initiated
 the complaint here 
filed
, or 
have threatened to file, new charges
 against petitioners, 
over new material published
 in FMH Philippines alleged to be obscene, after the case below was dismissed as early as July 19, 2016.
 
 
 The 
ponencia
 
took an exacting interpretation
 of the second requisite. The Court required
 reasonable expectation
 or a 
demonstrated probability
 that
 the same complaining party
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
. This second element is 
missing
 if it were 
highly speculative
 and 
hypothetical
, or 
highly doubtful
 if he or she can demonstrate a 
substantial likelihood
, that
 the same complaining party
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
.
 This ruling stressed that this second element may refer to 
history
 that it was 
not far-fetched
 that 
the same complaining party
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
. An
 affair of annual occurrence 
is one where there 
exists
 a
 reasonable expectation
 that 
the same complaining party
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
.

Ordinance No. 7780, an anti-obscenity law, cannot be facially attacked on the ground of overbreadth because obscenity is unprotected speech.
 
 
 
 
One.
 The 
ponencia
 held that petitioners'
 facial
 challenge based on the overbreadth doctrine was 
improper
 because this ground applied 
only
 to 
free speech cases
 â which the present petition was 
not
. According to the 
ponencia
, as this petition stemmed from an 
obscenity
 
and
 a 
criminal prosecution
, such 
facial
 challenge is 
not available
. (Emphasis supplied)
 
 The 
ponencia
 explained â
 
First
, a 
facial
 overbreadth challenge is
 limited
 to cases involving
 protected speech
, and 
obscenity
 is 
not a protected speech
. The 
ponencia
 justified this conclusion by holding that "laws that regulate or proscribe classes of speech falling beyond the ambit of constitutional protection cannot, therefore, be subject to facial invalidation 
because there is no 'transcendent value to all society' that would justify
 such attack." (Emphasis supplied)
 And, 
second
, a
 facial
 overbreadth challenge does 
not
 apply even to vague and overbroad 
penal statutes
 since the latter have
 no possible "chilling effect" upon protected speech
.
[5]
 Thus: 
 
 x x x The theory is that "[w]hen 
statutes regulate or proscribe speech
 and 
no readily apparent construction suggests itself
 as a vehicle
 for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution
, the 
transcendent value
 to all society 
of constitutionally protected expression
 is 
deemed
 to 
justify allowing attacks on overly broad statutes
 with 
no requirement
 that the 
person making the attack
 demonstrate that his 
own conduct could not be regulated
 by a statute 
drawn with narrow specificity
." The 
possible harm to society
 in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is 
outweighed by the possibility
 that the 
protected speech of others may be deterred
 and perceived grievances left to fester because of 
possible inhibitory effects of overly broad statutes
.
 
 
This rationale does not apply to penal statutes. Criminal statutes have general in terrorem effect
 resulting from their very existence, and, 
if facial challenge is allowed for this reason alone, the State may well be prevented from enacting laws
 against socially harmful conduct. In the area of criminal law, the law cannot take chances as in the area of free speech.
 
 The
 overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application only to free speech cases
. They are
 inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes
. As the US Supreme Court put it, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, "we have not recognized an 'overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment." x x x
 
 In sum, the 
doctrines of strict scrutiny, overbreadth, and vagueness
 are analytical tools developed
 for testing "on their faces" statutes in free speech cases
 or, as they are called in American law, First Amendment cases. They 
cannot be made to do service when what is involved is a criminal statute
. With respect to 
such statute, the established rule
 is that 
"one to whom application of a statute is constitutional
 will 
not be heard to attack
 the statute on the 
ground
 that impliedly it might
 also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional
." (Emphases supplied) 
 
 x x x x
 
 
 The 
ponencia
 further affirmed the rule that "only 
statutes on free speech, religious freedom
, and 
other fundamental rights may be facially challenged
. Under 
no
 case may 
ordinary penal
 statutes be 
subjected to a facial challenge
. The 
rationale
 is obvious. If a 
facial challenge
 to a penal statute is permitted, the 
prosecution of crimes may be hampered. No prosecution would be possible.
" 
 
Two
. The 
ponencia
 then 
characterized
 Ordinance No. 7780 as a 
criminal
 or 
penal statute
 that 
criminalizes
 or 
penalizes
 an 
unprotected speech
 â
obscenity
. As thus 
characterized
, this Court ruled that the Ordinance 
cannot be challenged on its face
. 
 On 
obscenity
 being an 
unprotected
 speech, the 
ponencia
 expounded: 
 
 It was in 1942 when the US Supreme Court first held in the landmark case of 
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire
[6]
 that the lewd and the obscene are not protected speech and therefore falls outside the protection of the First Amendment. x x x These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting" words â those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that 
such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas
, and are 
of such slight social value as a step to truth
 that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the 
social interest in order and morality
.
 
 Beginning from 
Roth v. United States
[7]
 (implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity) to Miller v. California, (this much has been categorically settled by the Court, that obscene material is unprotected by the First Amendment), the US Supreme Court has invariably held that obscene materials do not come under the protection of the First Amendment x x x
 
 As earlier stated, this Court has long accepted Chaplinsky's analysis that obscenity is unprotected speech. In 1985, We held, in the case of 
Gonzalez v. Katigbak
,
[8]
 that 
the law on freedom of expression frowns on obscenity.
 
x x x 
 
 x x x But implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance. This rejection for that reason is mirrored in the universal judgment that obscenity should be restrained, reflected in the international agreement of over 50 nations, in the obscenity laws of all of the 48 States, and in the 20 obscenity laws enacted by the Congress from 1842 to 1956. (Emphases supplied)
 
 x x x x
 
 
 
Three
. The 
ponencia
 held that 
while
 petitioners had
 no right
 to assail a law that regulates unprotected speech, such as Ordinance No. 7780, using a
 facial 
challenge, they may do so 
as-applied
, 
viz
: 
 
 This is not to suggest, however, that these laws are absolutely invulnerable to constitutional attack. 
 
 A litigant who stands charged under a law that regulates unprotected speech can still 
mount a challenge that a statute is unconstitutional as it is applied
 to him or her. In such a case, courts are left to 
examine the provisions
 of the law 
allegedly violated in light of the conduct
 with which the litigant has been charged. If the litigant prevails, the courts 
carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law
 by invalidating its improper applications 
on a case to case basis
. (Emphases supplied)
 
 
 The 
ponencia
 outlined the steps in assailing the Ordinance 
as-applied
.
 An 
as-applied
 challenge would require petitioners to 
go to trial
 to allow the trial court to determine whether "the materials complained of as obscene were indeed proscribed under the language of Ordinance No. 7780." This might also entail the 
adoption of the 
Miller
[9]
 
standards
 if petitioners raise them as a defense: 
 
 x x x x
 
 (a) whether "the 
average person
, applying 
contemporary community standards
" would find that the work,
 taken as a whole
, appeals to the 
prurient interest
; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a 
patently offensive way, sexual conduct
 specifically defined by the applicable state law; and
 (c)
 whether the work, 
taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
 value.
 
 The next steps in the 
as-applied
 challenge would be as follows:
 
 
 x x x petitioners could argue based on the 
Miller
 standards
 as applied
 to the specific material over which they were being prosecuted, they should be acquitted.
 
 
 On the other hand, the trial court, assuming it adopts Miller, will then have to receive evidence and render opinion on such issues as to: (a) who is the "average" Filipino; (b) what is the "community" against which "contemporary standards" are to be measured; (c) whether the subject material appeals to the "prurient" interest; (d) whether the material depicts "patently offensive" sexual conduct: and (e) whether the material "taken as a whole" has serious value.
 
 The decision of the RTC, whether or not in favor of petitioners, may then be brought up on appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), whose decision may later on be brought to this Court for review. Such is the process observed by the US Supreme Court in all of the obscenity cases cited by the 
ponencia
 which led to the adoption of the Miller standards in the US. The cases, including Miller, all involved appellate review conducted with the benefit of a full record.
 
 x x x x
 
 
 The 
ponencia
 stressed that 
none
 of the cases challenging anti-obscenity laws involved a 
facial
 attack on the ground of overbreadth. It also rejected, on separation of powers rationale, petitioners' plea to superimpose the 
Miller
 standards on Ordinance No. 7780, thus: 
 
 x x x x
 
 We stress at this point that the Court in Miller did not impose that the standards it laid down be legislated. On the contrary, the Court there was very careful not to overstep its judicial boundaries: 
 
 We emphasize that it is not our function to propose regulatory schemes for the States. That must await their concrete legislative efforts. It is possible, however, to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion, 
supra
: 
 
 (a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.
 (b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals. 
 
 In fact, Miller explicitly held that the 
obscene conduct
 depicted or described in materials which is
 sought to be regulated "must be specifically defined by the applicable state law
, as written or authoritatively construed." x x x Accordingly, 
whether a material is obscene
 or not is still 
for the Court to decide as it applies or construes a specific statute in a particular case
.
 
 x x x x
 
 Finally, x x x 
as applied to the actual facts of the case 
is the 
proper precedent to follow
 if the Court were 
to consider adopting the Miller standard
 in our jurisdiction. Thus, and until the proper case presents itself, prudence dictates that the Court should exercise judicial restraint.
 
 x x x x
 
 
 Petitioners moved for reconsideration of the 
dismissal
 of the petition. The Resolution penned by the learned Honorable Chief Justice Diosdado M. Peralta affirmed the dismissal by reiterating the 
ponencia
's rationale.
 
Since 2018
, FHM has shifted from 
paper-based
 to 
digital publications
.
[10]
 There is 
no reason
 to believe that this shift has exempted petitioners as publishers and distributers of these magazines in 
digital format
 from the coverage of Ordinance No. 7780. If at all, this shift may have
 far worse adverse implications
 upon them due to Section 6 of RA 10175 (2012), 
Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012
, which states: 
 
 SECTION 6. 
All crimes defined and penalized by the Revised Penal Code, as amended
, and special laws, if committed by, through and with the use of information and communications technologies 
shall be covered by the relevant provisions of this Act: Provided, That the penalty to be imposed shall be one (1) degree higher
 than that provided for by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and special laws, as the case may be.
 
 
 
MY RESPECTFUL DISSENT
 
 
 I joined the 
ponencia
 when the case was 
first
 decided. My vote was based on my assessment 
then
 of the cogency of its
 ratio decidendi
.
 On petitioners' motion, however, and after a more introspective analysis of the arguments raised in my senior colleagues' respective Opinions and relevant case law both new and old,
 I now vote to grant
 the petition and 
to declare
 Ordinance No. 7780 as 
unconstitutional
. 
 
 A. The Issues
 
 
 
 The dispositive issues are:
 
One
. Is the petition a 
freedom of expression
 (or 
free speech
) case?
 
Two
. Has the petition seeking to declare Ordinance No. 7780 as unconstitutional been rendered 
moot
 â
 1. When, after preliminary investigation, the criminal complaint for violation of Ordinance No. 7780 (along with Article 200 of the RPC but upon another ground) was dismissed per Resolution dated June 25, 2013 of the OCP of Manila, since "the subject matter covered by the city ordinance of Manila is already absorbed in Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code."
 2. When, during the trial, Criminal Case No. 13-30084 for violation of Article 201 (3) of the RPC was dismissed with prejudice upon petitioners' motion due to the People's failure to prosecute?
 
Three
. May Ordinance No. 7780 be 
challenged on its face
 on the ground of 
overbreadth
 though it is a 
penal
 statute that seeks
 to punish alleged obscene and indecent expressions
?
 
Four
. If Ordinance No. 7780 may be challenged 
facially
, does Ordinance No. 7780 
on its face
 violate freedom of expression for being 
overbroad
; and as a 
content-based criminalization
, the 
strict scrutiny test
?
 
Five
. 
As applied
 to petitioners, did Ordinance No. 7780 violate their freedom of expression when it sought to prohibit and penalize their acts of printing, publishing, distributing, circulating and/or selling certain identified issue of their FHM Magazine? 
 
 B. My Submissions
 
 
 
 
 
One
. 
The present petition is a 
freedom of expression
 (or 
free speech
) case.
 
 
 
 
It is my respectful submission that the 
pitfalls
 in the original 
ponencia
 
started
 with its 
characterization
 of the petition as 
not being
 a
 freedom of expression
 or 
free speech
 case, and its 
approach
 to 
lump
 Ordinance No. 7780 
together with penal laws
 that has 
nothing to do
 with 
expression
. 
 The 
ponencia
 
held
 that this case is
 not
 about 
free speech 
because 
obscene
 expression is
 unprotected speech
. This, however,
 begs the question
.
 The petition was initiated 
precisely to test
 whether indeed Ordinance No. 7780 
impacts on expression
, and
 if it does
, whether it 
only penalizes obscene
 expression or includes within its ambit 
protected
 speech. To 
at once concede
 that the assailed Ordinance is 
all about obscenities
 is to 
assume
 the 
truthfulness
 of the
 issues
 that 
in the first place
 are precisely the 
subject of the petition
.
 The 
characterization
 of the petition as 
not
 being a free speech case is 
erroneous
 because the 
subject matter of Ordinance No. 7780
 â 
materials
 or 
acts
 such as 
photography, movies, music records, video and VHS tapes, laser discs, billboards, television, magazines, newspapers, tabloids, comics
 and 
live shows
 â is a form of 
speech
 or 
expression
, and the assailed Ordinance 
punishes on its face
 the 
printing, publishing, distributing, circulating
 and/or 
selling
 of these materials or acts 
on account
 of their respective 
contents
 or 
messages
.
 The
 materials
 or
 acts
 subject of Ordinance No. 7780 are forms of 
speech
 or 
expression
 since they each
 intend to convey a particularized message
, and each of the messages they intend to convey is 
most likely to be understood as such
 by those who heard, read, or viewed it.
[11]
 
 Here, the 
particularized messages
 targeted by the Ordinance are 
indecency, eroticism, lewdness, offensiveness to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind, calculation to excite impure imagination or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, unfitness to be seen or heard, or violation of the proprieties of language or behavior
. As stated, this Ordinance 
punishes on its face
 the 
printing, publishing, distributing, circulating
 and/or
 selling
 of these materials or acts 
on account
 
of
 these 
contents
 or 
messages
.
 It is accepted that: 
 
 x x x x
 
 The 
First Amendment literally forbids the abridgment only of
 "
speech
," 
but we have long recognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word
. While we have 
rejected
 "
the view
 that an apparently
 limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever
 the person engaging in the conduct
 intends thereby to express an idea
," we 
have acknowledged
 that 
conduct
 may be "
sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First
 and Fourteenth 
Amendment
s." x x x Hence, we have 
recognized the expressive nature
 of students' wearing of black armbands to protest American military involvement in Vietnam, of a sit-in by blacks in a "whites only" area to protest segregation; of the wearing of American military uniforms in a dramatic presentation criticizing American involvement in Vietnam; and of picketing about a wide variety of causes.
[12]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
x x x x
 
 
 Here, the petition 
challenges
 Ordinance No. 7780 
precisely
 because it 
seeks to control
 by 
criminalizing
 the 
expressions
 of petitioners and those similarly situated 
because
 of the 
criminalized meanings
 the expressions convey.
 Note that laws regulating 
speech
 or 
expression
 are classified as either 
content-based
 or 
content-neutral
. For this reason, 
challenges
 to 
such laws
 are 
treated
 and 
analyzed
 as 
free speech
 cases. 
 
Content-neutral 
laws involve regulations that impact upon the
 time, place,
 and 
manner
 of the expression or the 
secondary effects
 of the speech and 
only minimally
 the 
message
 or 
meaning
 conveyed or imparted. Ordinance No. 7780 is
 not
 a
 content-neutral
 penal law because it has 
nothing to do with
 the time, place, and manner of the subject-matter expression or its secondary effects. 
 On the other hand
 content-based 
laws target speech based on its 
communicative content
.
[13]
 These laws ask
 
what the subject materials
 or 
acts communicate
 as 
meanings
 and 
what punishments
 or 
regulations
 are to be 
imposed
 these 
materials
 or 
acts on account of
 these 
meanings
. Stated differently, the
 test
 to determine whether a government regulation is 
content-based
 is as follows: 
 
 x x x x
 
 Government regulation of speech is 
content based
 if 
a law applies to particular speech
 
because of
 the 
topic discussed
 or the
 idea or message expressed
. This common-sense meaning of the phrase "content based" requires a court to consider 
whether a regulation of speech "on its face" draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys
.
[14]
 
 x x x x
 
 
 As held in 
Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, Inc. v. Joyce
,
[15]
 [a] statute 'would 
not be content neutral
 if it were 
concerned with undesirable effects
 that arise from 'the 
direct impact of speech on its audience
' or '
[l]isteners' reactions to speech
."' To illustrate: 
 
 In Boos, a District of Columbia provision 
banned display of any sign within 500 feet of a foreign embassy which tended to bring the foreign government into ''public odium" or ''disrepute."
 485 U.S. at 315 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court decided that
 the District's law was content based and unconstitutional
, for
 its ban on sign displays sought to regulate "speech due to its potential primary impact"
 â that is the 
effect
 
"that speech has on its listeners."
 Id. at 321, 329. Because the law sought "'to protect the dignity of foreign diplomatic personnel 
by shielding them from speech that is critical of their governments
," it was content based.
[16]
 
 
 To elucidate further, a rule is "
content-based
 on its face" if it 
defines several terms based on the message
 the material or act conveys, and then 
subjects each message or category of message
 to different restrictions,
[17]
 or in this case,
 to different criminal penalties
.
 Ordinance No. 7780's ban on allegedly indecent and obscene materials and acts is 
obviously designed to protect against
 these materials and acts' "
potential primary impact
." The Ordinance thus seeks to criminalize their 
printing, publishing, distributing circulating
 and/or 
selling
. Some of the messages which petitioners 
seek to communicate
 may well be considered indecent and obscene by their target audience. The very topics which petitioners wish to address, including eroticism, sexuality, sex stories, sexual abuse, women and LGBTQ rights, sectarian and religious beliefs and quirks, fashion, anything and everything that a reader 
may not find
 in broadsheets and 
regular
 publications, can 
elicit strong emotional responses
 whether from the religious (such as the 
complainants against petitioners
), church members, victims of abuse and their supporters, those erotically inclined, or any other member of the public. Others 
may take exception
 to the materials or acts demonstrations, others 
may accept
 and 
embrace
 the 
messages
 â the fact remains that the 
control
 sought by the Ordinance emanates from the materials and acts' respective 
communicative
 
actual
 and 
perceived
 intent.
 Once a law is 
determined
 to be either 
content-based
 or 
content-neutral
, it 
necessarily follows
 that the 
analysis
 in the 
challenge to that law
 would have to take account of the 
standards
 inherent in 
free speech
 cases.
 Ordinance No. 7780 is thus a 
content-based
 criminal prohibition. It operates upon the 
materials
 or 
acts 
therein mentioned 
precisely because
 of the 
topic they discuss
 or 
the idea or message they express
. This Ordinance 
draws distinctions
 on what is 
criminal
 and what is not 
criminal 
based on the 
message
 a speaker conveys. As stated, the
 criminal messages
 are 
indecency, eroticism, lewdness, offensiveness to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind, calculation to excite impure imagination or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, unfitness to be seen or heard, or violation of the proprieties of language or behavior
. The Ordinance 
punishes on its face
 the 
printing, publishing, distributing, circulating
 and/or
 selling
 of materials or acts that convey these 
contents
 or 
messages
. 
 The petition seeks to declare Ordinance No. 7780 because of its 
adverse impact
 on petitioners' free expression as a 
content-based
 criminal law. The 
analysis
 of the arguments raised in the petition 
necessarily calls for
 the application of
 free speech
 standards. To 
reject
 this petition as a free speech case is to 
undermine
 progressive 
generations of human rights jurisprudence
 on the 
right to free expression
. 
 Additionally, the 
characterization
 of the petition as 
not
 a free speech case is 
especially problematic
 since'"[i]n evaluating the 
free speech rights of adults
,' the Supreme Court has "made it perfectly clear that '
sexual expression
 which is 
indecent
 but not obscene is 
protected by the First Amendment
."'
[18]
 To illustrate, 
nude dancing
 of a certain type is
 expressive
 conduct, so that "
any ordinance regulating nude dancing
 must be 
analyzed
 to ensure it does 
not unduly impair
 the 
exercise of First Amendment rights
."
[19]
 To repeat, the 
holding
 that
 ordinances
 aimed at 
regulating adult entertainment businesses
 may constitute 
content-based
 or 
content-neutral
 regulations
[20]
 
seriously
 and 
necessarily implies
 that such ordinances must be 
reviewed
 as
 free speech
 cases.
 It is 
of course true
 that 
obscene
 expressions are 
beyond
 the succor of the
 right to expression
. But, 
before
 we may even reach the 
conclusion
 that Ordinance No. 7780 
penalizes only speech outside
 of constitutional 
protection
, which in this case would be 
obscene
, and is therefore, 
constitutionally permissible
, we 
must first examine
 the Ordinance from the perspectives of 
free speech
.
 In other words: we 
must treat
 the petition as a 
free speech
 case. Thus: Is the Ordinance one that 
impacts on expression
? And because the Ordinance does, is it a 
content-based
 or a content-neutral 
prohibition
? Here, I have explained that the Ordinance is a 
content-based
 prohibition. Further: What 
injuries
 have been 
caused
 to 
petitioners' expression
? Do these 
injuries persist
? Or have they been 
mooted
? May these
 injuries
 be still 
remedied
 through this petition? How do we 
test
 the 
validity
 of the 
criminal punishment
 of expression as specified in the assailed Ordinance? And, what is the 
result
 of the 
application
 of the 
appropriate test
? 
 
Free speech
 cases allow both 
on-its-face challenge
 and 
as-applied challenge
. A 
facial challenge 
alleges
 overbreadth
 and as a result 
covers instances 
or 
illustrative incidents
 that may not be the petitioner or plaintiff's own situation or situations. The offending law may be
 invalidated
 on the ground of 
overbreadth
 â this is because the 
chilling
 effect on one's expression is an 
injury-in-fact
 in free speech cases
[21]
 that may be 
remedied
 by the 
invalidation
. 
Content-based
 regulations of expression are 
presumptively unconstitutional
 and may be
 justified only
 under 
strict scrutiny
 if the government proves that they are 
narrowly tailored
 to serve
 compelling state interests
.
 This Court's ruling also 
erred
 in 
lumping
 Ordinance No. 7780 
together with penal laws
 that have 
nothing to do
 with 
expression
, such as the criminal law against 
plunder
 referred to in the 
ponencia

 With 
utmost respect
, this approach is 
erroneous
 since
 laws that impact on free expression
 are 
analyzed differently

other penal
 laws. Thus, in

Fire Fighters

The injury requirement is most loosely applied--particularly in terms of how directly the injury must result from the challenged governmental action--where First Amendment rights are involved
, because of the fear that free speech will be chilled [*1494] even before the law, regulation, or policy is enforced.

 fear of disciplinary action was reasonable
 and thus, the 
harm he suffered was an objective chill
 of his First Amendment rights.

 This is precisely the approach taken by the Third Circuit in Stretton, 944 F.2d 137. There, a judicial candidate brought a 
pre-enforcement
 challenge
 to a section of Pennsylvania's Code of Judicial Conduct that bars judicial candidates from announcing their views on disputed legal or political issues. The 
plaintiff alleged a chill of his protected speech rights
 and the disciplinary authorities disclaimed that the proposed speech would violate the canon. 
Nevertheless, the court held that a case or controversy existed
. The court wrote:
 
 The Boards take the position here as they did in the district court that the topics plaintiff proposes to discuss in the course of his campaign do not violate the Code. The Boards, however, do not have the final word [**32] on interpretation of the Code. Moreover, 
plaintiff has also challenged the Canon on overbreadth grounds and 
may maintain the action on that basis
. See Board of Trustees of the State Univ. of New York v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 484, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 3037, 106 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1989)

Two
. 
The present petition seeking to declare Ordinance No. 7780 as unconstitutional has
 not
 been rendered 
moot
 when (a) after preliminary investigation, the criminal complaint for violation of Ordinance No. 7780 was dismissed (along with Article 200 of the RPC but upon another ground) through the Resolution dated June 25, 2013 of the Office of the City Prosecutor since "the subject matter covered by the city ordinance of Manila x x x is already absorbed in Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code x x x" and (b) during trial, Criminal Case No. 13-30084 for violation of Article 201 (3) of The Revised Penal Code was dismissed with prejudice upon petitioners' motion due to the People's failure to prosecute.
 
 
 
 
The 
ponencia
 correctly defined a 
"moot and academic case"
 as "one that 
ceases to present a justiciable controversy
 by virtue of supervening events, so that a 
declaration thereon
 would be of 
no practical use or value
." A
 moot case lacks "actual controversies
 involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable x x x" without which courts have 
no jurisdiction
 to act. 
 I respectfully beg to differ. 
 
 a. The Doctrine of Mootness is inapplicable. 
 
 
 
 
 The 
doctrine of mootness
 is 
intimately connected
 with the 
interrelated requirements
 of 
standing, injury
 and 
case and controversy
. This is because 
only if an actual controversy ceases to exist
 at any stage of litigation 
would the case
 become 
moot
 and should be dismissed.
[24]
 Hence, if 
standing, injury 
and 
case and controversy 
have been established to exist and 
continues to exist
, it 
necessarily follows
 that the case is 
not moot
. 
 The 
case or controversy requirement
 must be met throughout the entirety of the proceedings.
[25]
 Whether an
 actual and live controversy
 exists over the constitutionality of a law, when a party brings a 
pre-enforcement
 challenge 
or
 a challenge 
after-the-fact
, that is, when the government has 
voluntarily ceased
 the challenged conduct, the court 
must
 ask 
whether
 
"the conflicting parties present a real, substantial 
controversy
 which is definite and concrete rather than hypothetical and abstract
."
[26]
 In order
 to prove
 that a 
real and substantial 
controversy
 exists
, a plaintiff 
must
 show "
a realistic danger of sustaining direct injury as a result of the statute's operation or enforcement
."
[27]
 On the other hand, to have 
standing
, a plaintiff must (1) have
 suffered an 
injury in fact
, (2) that is
 fairly traceable to the challenged action
 of the defendant, and (3) that will
 likely be redressed by a favorable decision
.
[28]
 
Standing
 and 
case and controversy
 depend upon, among others, the existence and 
continued existence
 of an 
injury in fact
. Where the case points to these 
three (3) items
, it 
cannot be said
 that 
mootness
 adversely impacts on the case.
 Here, the 
dismissal
 of the complaint for violation of Ordinance No. 7780 on 
preliminary investigation
 and the 
dismissal
 on trial of the criminal case for violation of Article 201 (3) of 
The RPC
 
did not stop
 the injury-in-fact to petitioners, 
did not end
 the enforceability of the Ordinance, and 
did not render ineffectual 
the declaration of the Ordinance as void for being unconstitutional. It must be stressed that the instant petition is 
not just about halting the criminal proceedings
 against petitioners 
but also involves making sure that the criminal proceedings do not happen again
 and that 
petitioners are not ever chilled, unsettled, alarmed, petrified
, and 
terrified
 in making the speech or expression they have been doing. In sum, 
these matters clarify
 why the case has 
not
 been rendered moot and is 
not
 moot, and why petitioners have
 retained their standing
 and are 
still entitled to seek relief 
on judicial review. 
 
 i. Injury-in-fact and Case and Controversy
 
 
 
 In a 
pre-enforcement
 challenge, when a plaintiff has stated that he or she "
intends to engage
 in a specific course of conduct '
arguably affected with a constitutional interest
,' he or she "
does not have to expose
 himself [or herself] 
to enforcement
 to be able to challenge the law. If the 
injury is certainly impending
, that is 
enough
."
[29]
Thus, a plaintiff has "
suffered an injury in fact
 if he or she 
(1)
 has an "
intention to engage
 in a course of 
conduct arguably
 affected with a 
constitutional interest
, (2) his or her 
intended future conduct
 is '
arguably . . . proscribed
 by [the
 policy in question
],' and (3) the 
threat of future enforcement
 of the [challenged policies] is 
substantial
."
[30]
 
 In a challenge 
after-the-fact
, that is, when the government has
 voluntarily ceased
 the challenged conduct, 
as in here
, a 
live case or controversy
 remains if there is 
some possibility
 that "the defendants 
will seek to enforce
 the challenged regulation." This is the case 
if
, as in the
 present case
, the 
prosecutors continue to assert 
that, despite their acquiescence in the 
dismissal
 of the complaint for violation of Ordinance No. 7780, the 
latter
 is 
constitutional
.
[31]
 This
 assertion
 of the 
prosecutors
 is found in the 
Comment
 they 
filed
 against the present petition.
 Therefore, I have 
no reason to think that Ordinance No. 7780 would not be enforced again
 in the future against petitioners or others similarly situated.
[32]
 This is 
because neither
 the prosecutors at the Office of the City Prosecutor in the City of Manila 
nor
 any panel to be constituted by that office is 
bound
 by the 
Resolution
 dated June 25, 2013. 
More
, the panel of prosecutors that investigated the criminal complaint against petitioners is 
not
 the final arbiter of whether a violation of the Ordinance 
cannot be pursued
 simultaneously with a charge for violating Articles 200 and 201 of 
The RPC
 as was resolved in the preliminary investigation against petitioners.
 An 
absolute bar
 from 
any re-filing
 of similar criminal complaints 
would moot
 this case.
[33]
 Unfortunately, however, that 
bar
 is 
not yet in place
. The "
[v]oluntary cessation
 of challenged conduct" 
moots
 a case "
only if
 it is '
absolutely clear
 that the allegedly 
wrongful behavior could not be reasonably expected to recur
."' Certainly, the 
continuing existence
 of the unaltered Ordinance No. 7780 and the Office of the City Protector's 
continuous assertion
 of its constitutionality and enforceability 
do not make it "absolutely clear"
 that the Office of the City Prosecutor will 
not
 change its mind as expressed in its 
Resolution
 dated June 25, 2013.
[34]
 
 
 
 
ii.
 
 Injury-in-fact, Case and Controversy and Causation (fairly traceable to defendant's action) 
 
 
 
 
 
There is a
 real and immediate fear
 of 
indictmen
t and 
prosecution against petitioners
, together with their 
collateral negative effects
 of 
again violating
 and 
chilling
 their
 right to free speech
 when the Office of the City Prosecutor 
again accepts a criminal complaint
 for violation of Ordinance No. 7780 against petitioners or those similarly situated, 
entertains the criminal complaint
 by 
forming a panel of prosecutors
 to 
interrogate
 them and 
resolve
 the criminal complaint, and 
files
 and
 prosecutes
 the Information against them for violating the Ordinance, with the trial court 
issuing warrants for their arrest, requiring bail
 for their continuous appearance, 
limiting
 their r
ight to travel or movement
, and 
entering criminal records
 under their respective names. 
 
 The same facts â the 
continuing existence
 of the unaltered Ordinance No. 7780 and the Office of the City Prosecutor's 
continuous assertion
 of the 
constitutionality
 and
 enforceability
 of Ordinance No. 7780 â 
represent
 a 
"very real, and very fearsome, possibility
 of [a 
criminal complaint
 and] 
prosecution
," and 
"ample demonstration that [petitioners'] concern with
 [
criminal complaint
 and 
prosecution
] 
has not been 'chimerical
."
[35]
 To be sure,
 past enforcement
 of speech-related laws and the 
continuing assertions of their validity
 and 
enforceability
 can legitimately assure
 injury-in-fact
.
[36]
 
 As held in 
American Civil Liberties Union v. The Florida Bar
,
[37]
 a 
live case
 or 
controversy continues to exist
 where "plaintiffs '
wanted to pursue a specific course of action
 which they knew was at least 
arguably forbidden
 by the pertinent law'; 
and
 (2) "
all that remained
 between the plaintiff and 
impending harm
 was the 
defendant's discretionary
 decision â 
which could be changed
 â to withhold [enforcement]." 
 
American Civil Liberties Union v. The Florida Bar 
further notes that the United States Supreme Court has held that a 
case or controversy remains
 after a defendant 
voluntarily ceases
 an alleged improper behaviour 
but is free to resume it at any time
, a situation that often arises when the parties enter into a 
voluntary dismissal 
of the action to which the 
defendant is not bound
 â 
as in this
. 
 This situation could result in 
hardship
 and 
absurdity
. If the defendant 
resumes the harmful
 activity, and plaintiff 
goes back to court
, the defendant 
can again cease to engage in the harmful conduct
 and 
argue
 that the case is 
moot
. To address this hardship and absurdity, 
American Civil Liberties Union v. The Florida Bar cited United States v. W.T. Grant Co.
, 345 U.S. 629, 73 S. Ct. 894, 97 L. Ed. 1303 (1953) and held that in this situation, the only way the case would be rendered 
moot
 is if "the 
defendant can demonstrate
 that there is
 no reasonable expectation
 that 
the wrong will be repeated
." 
 Here, the
 wrong
 that would 
reasonably be repeated
 is the 
continuous assertion
 by the Office of the City Prosecutor that 
Ordinance No. 7780
 is 
constitutional
 and 
enforceable
 as well as the 
continued enforcement
 of the assailed Ordinance. Because it is
 not bound
 by the dismissal of the criminal complaint against petitioners in other criminal complaints, a 
reasonable expectation
 exists that 
this wrong will be repeated
. This 
straightforward assertion
 of 
constitutionality
 and 
enforceability
 would be 
enough to chill speech
 and would 
cause
 and 
perpetuate
 the aforementioned 
correlative negative consequences
. These constitute petitioners' 
injury-in-fact
 that would then 
establish
 the 
live case or controversy
 in the present 
free speech case
. 
 In 
Willson v. City of Bel-Nor
,
[38]
 the plaintiff was charged with a violation of a sign-regulation ordinance, and as a result, sought an injunction against the charge and a declaratory relief against the sign-regulation ordinance. But before this action could be resolved, the City 
nolle prosequi
 the Information. The court 
held
 that the 
nolle prosequi
 of the Information 
did not moot
 the case for injunction and declaratory relief. It explained: 
 
 x x x "A 
case becomes moot
 if it 
can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation
 that the 
violation will recur
 or if interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation." Kennedy Bldg. Assocs. v. Viacom, Inc., 375 F.3d 731, 745 (8th Cir. 2004). "The 
heavy burden of persua[ding] the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness
." Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)." Here, there is 
no change to the Ordinance
 and the Court finds 
Plaintiff is still in violation of it
. 
 
 x x x x
 
 
 As in 
Willson
, respondents
 did 
not
 discharge 
their burden
 of proving that the 
challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again
. Actually, respondents 
could not have discharged
 this 
burden
 because they have
 consistently asserted
 the 
constitutionality
 and 
enforceability
 of Ordinance No. 7780. 
 In 
City of Erie v. Pap's A.M.
,
[39]
 the United States Supreme Court
 rejected
 the claim that the case for injunction and declaratory relief as regards an anti-nudity ordinance has been
 mooted
 by the 
closure of the subject establishment
 offering public nudity. This is because: (1) the establishment was then "still incorporated under Pennsylvania law, and 
it could again decide to operate
 a nude dancing establishment in Erie;" and (2) the City that enacted the ordinance would be 
suffering an ongoing injury
 because it 
lost 
the court case in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and as a result would be 
barred from enforcing the public nudity provisions of its ordinance
. The 
respective interests
 of the nudity establishment, the City, and the administration of justice itself 
demanded
 a 
resolution
 of the case of injunction and declaratory relief to its
 finality
: 
 
 x x x If the 
challenged ordinance is found constitutional
, then 
Erie can enforce it
, and the availability of such relief is sufficient to prevent the case from being moot. And
 Pap's still has a concrete stake in the outcome
 of this case because, to the extent Pap's 
has an interest in resuming operations
, it has an interest in preserving the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 
Our interest
 in 
preventing litigants from attempting to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review
 further counsels against a finding of mootness here.
[40]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 x x x x
 
 
 The same interests are 
impacted
 here. The City of Manila
 can enforce without challenge
 Ordinance No. 7780. Petitioners 
can operate
 its publications business 
without fear of prosecution and public relations backlash
. This Court would have an interest in 
precluding
 litigants from 
insulating
 a 
favorable decision
, as in the case of the Office of the City Prosecutor's Resolution dated June 25, 2013, from our 
review
. 
 Hence, the 
controversy
 here is 
not moot
. 
 Notably, in 
both types of challenge
,
 pre-enforcement
 and 
after-theÂ­ fact,
 the
 injury
 requirement is 
most loosely applied
 â particularly in terms of how directly the injury must result from the challenged governmental action â where the 
right to free expression is involved
, because of the 
fear that free speech will be chilled
 even 
before
 the law, regulation, or policy is 
enforced
[41]
 or when the 
enforcement 
is 
voluntarily stopped
. 
 Here, petitioners'
 fear of prosecution was
 and 
remains reasonable
 because of the 
continued assertion
 by the Office of the City Prosecutor of the 
constitutionality
 and 
enforceability
 of Ordinance No. 7780. The
 harm they have suffered
 and 
will continue to suffer was
 and
 remain
 to be an 
objective chill
 of their 
right to free expression
 and the aforesaid 
negative collateral consequences
 of the filing of a criminal complaint and its prosecution. This
 harm substantiates
 the claim that a 
case or controversy
 existed and
 continues to exist
.
[42]
 
 The 
nature
 of the petition as a
 facial challenge
 is also 
significant
. It is a
 factor
 in determining 
whether it is clearly likely that
 "
the future threat of enforcement of the [challenged policy] is substantial
."
[43]
 Thus: 
 
 At this point, 
"[t]he distinction between facial and as-applied challenges bears legal significance."
 See Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 766. Whereas "
[t]here must be some evidence
 that [a] rule would be applied to the plaintiff in order for that plaintiff to bring an 
as-applied challenge
," that is 
not the case for facial challenges
. Instead, "
when dealing with pre-enforcement challenges to recently enacted
 (or, at least, non-moribund) 
statutes
 that 
facially restrict expressive activity
 by the class
 to which the plaintiff belongs, courts will assume a credible threat of prosecution in the absence. of compelling contrary evidence
."
[44]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 This 
presumption of a credible threat of prosecution
 applies to this case at bar. There is
 no evidence
 to the contrary. 
 
 
 
iii.
 
Causation and Redressability
 
 
 
 
Lastly, 
mootness
 is 
defeated
 as well by the 
existence of causation
 and 
redressability
.
[45]
 Here, the 
enforcement
 though 
aborted
 and the 
continued threat of enforcement
 of the challenged Ordinance have caused petitioners' 
chill
 of their expression and 
negative collateral consequences
 from their 
adverse involvement
 in the 
criminal
 justice system. These
 injuries
 could be 
redressed
 by a
 categorical and non-discretionary
 ruling
 enjoining
 the
 enforcement
 of Ordinance No. 7780.
[46]
 
 
 b. At any rate, the exceptions to the Doctrine of Mootness apply.
 
 
 
 
i.
 
Capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review Exception
 
 
 
 
 
In any event, assuming 
without conceding
 that the present case appears
 technically mooted
, it 
still has
 in reality a
 live controversy
 because 
the legal questions it presents for decision 
will recur and again evade review.
[47]
 The petition falls within the category of cases that are "
capable of repetition, yet evading review
" 
exception
 to mootness. 
 
 As the 
ponencia
 correctly said, this 
exception
 applies when "(1) the 
challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated
 prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [i]s a
 reasonable expectation
 that 
the same complaining party
 would be 
subjected to the same action again
."
[48]
 As the party asserting the exception, 
petitioners bear the burden
 of establishing that it applies.
[49]
 Petitioners satisfied the 
first prong
 of the 
capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review
 exception. 
 
Ordinarily
, there is 
no preliminary investigation
 of criminal complaints for 
violations of ordinances
 since the 
penalties
 for these violations 
do not exceed
 imprisonment for 
four (4)
 years.
[50]
 Under the Rules of Court, the 
process
 should be 
finished
 in 
no more than ten days from the date of filing
 of the criminal complaint.
[51]
 This 
timing discrepancy
 virtually 
guarantees
 that the 
direct filing will expire before
 the constitutional challenge reaches the courts, let alone, the Supreme Court. 
Notably, too, the power of 
judicial review
, or the power to 
declare unconstitutional
 a statute, treaty, international or executive agreement, presidenti
al decree, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation lies in the courts
 and 
not
 with an administrative officer or agency such as the Office of the City Prosecutor in Manila City or its panels.
[52]
 Hence, it would 
not be the proper office
 to resolve; and therefore would be 
useless to raise
, the issue of constitutionality of Ordinance No. 7780 before the Office of the City Prosecutor. 
 The 
second prong
 of the requisites â ''
a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again
" â presents a 
more difficult question
. It has been affirmed that the "
reasonable expectation
" 
of repetition
 must be 
more than
 "a 
mere physical or theoretical possibility
." 
 But 
what exactly
 must be 
capable of repetition
? 
Nathan M. v. Harrison Sch. Dist. No. 2
,
[53]
 illustrated the
 different ways 
this question has been answered: 
 
 x x x This difficulty stems, in part,
 from a lack of precision in our cases describing exactly what must be likely to recur
. In Fischbach, vve asked whether the complaining party would be "
subjected to the action again
." Fischbach, 38 F.3d at 1161 (quoting Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 377, 99 S. Ct. 2898, 61 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1979)). Then in Wyoming v. U.S. Dep't of Agric. 414 F.3d 1207, 1212 (10th Cir. 2005), we asked the same question, but about potentially
 recurrent
 "
conduct
." We reframed the question again in McKeen v. U.S. Forest Serv., 615 F.3d 1244, 1255-56 (10th Cir. 2010), which spoke in terms of an "
issue
" or an "
alleged injury
" that could be repeated, and in Parker v. Winter, 645 F. App'x 632, 635 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished) (quoting Honig, 484 U.S. at 319 n.6), asking whether a claimant had demonstrated that a recurrence of the "
dispute
" was more [*1042] probable than not and whether the "
controversy
" was capable of repetition. (Emphases supplied) 
 
 
 As 
summarized
 in 
Nathan M. v. Harrison Sch. Dist. No. 2
,
[54]
 "the 
'wrong
' that is, or is not, 'capable of repetition' must be 
defined in terms of the precise controversy it spawns
." The alleged '
wrong
' must be put in terms of
 the legal questions it presents for decision
." 
 Pulling these various threads together,
 to satisfy the second prong of the capable-of-repetition exception to mootness
, petitioners 
bear the burden
 of establishing that it is 
reasonably likely
[55]
 that the Office of the City Prosecutor, 
to repeat
, will
 again violate
 and
 chill
 their
 right to free speech
 by 
accepting a criminal complaint
 for violation of Ordinance No. 7780 against petitioners or those similarly situated, 
entertaining 
the 
criminal complaint
 by
 forming a panel of prosecutors
 to 
interrogate
 them and 
resolve
 the criminal complaint, and 
filing
 and 
prosecuting
 the Information against them for violating the Ordinance, with the trial court
 issuing warrants for their arrest, requiring bail
 for their continuous appearance,
 limiting
 their
 right to travel or movement
, and 
entering criminal records
 under their respective names. 
 Petitioners have clearly 
discharged
 their burden of proving the 
wrongs
 that will 
likely happen
 if the present case would 
continue
 to be declared 
moot
, as was done by this Court in its present ruling. The 
second prong
 of the 
capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review
 exception has also been 
satisfied
. 
 But to justify its ruling that the present case has been rendered 
moot
, the 
ponencia
 held that the 
dismissal with prejudice 
of the criminal case
 against petitioners before the trial court would ensure that
 they would not be prosecuted again
 for violation of Ordinance No. 7780. 
 With utmost respect, this ruling is based on an
 erroneous appreciation of the facts
, and as result, 
inaccurate conclusion of law
. 
 The 
dismissal with prejudice
 by the trial court referred 
solely
 to the charge for
 violation of Article 201 (3)
 of the RPC, and 
not
 to the charge for 
violation of Ordinance No. 7780
. The 
dismissal with prejudice
 precludes
 only
 the re-filing of 
the same acts
 complained of as constituting the offense 
under Article 201 (3)
 of the RPC. The 
dismissal with prejudice
 has 
nothing
 to do with the 
violation of the City Ordinance
 or with the 
other issues
 of the 
condemned publications
 whether prior or subsequent to the latter. 
 To recall, the 
complaint for violation of Ordinance No. 7780
 was processed at the 
level of the Office of the City Prosecutor
 in the City of Manila. It was 
dismissed
 by said office in its 
Resolution
 dated June 25, 2013
 not because
 the complaint was
 unmeritorious; rather
, the 
dismissal
 was based on its theory that the elements of this offense were 
absorbed
 by the
 complainants' other claims
 for violations of the RPC. There is also
 no res judicata
 or 
double jeopardy
 in proceedings before the Office of the City Prosecutor.
[56]
 
 Hence, 
both requisites
 for the application of the 
capable-ofÂ­ repetition-yet-evading-review exception
 to 
mootness
 are present. There is no way the present petition has been mooted. 
 
 
 
ii.
 
Negative collateral consequences 
 
 
 
 
Another 
exception to mootness
 justifies the foregoing conclusion â 
negative collateral consequences
.
[57]
 To recall, the 
doctrine of mootness
 is 
justified
 by the 
requirement
 of an "
actual controversy
 arising between 
adverse
 litigants who have a 
legally cognizable interest in the outcome
 of the case."
[58]
 This 
requirement
 is in turn 
warranted
 by the 
lack of constitutional authority
 to render mere 
advisory opinions
.
[59]
 
 A case 
becomes moot
 when a court "
can no longer grant effective relief
."
[60]
 And even if a case 
was not moot when it was first filed' intervening events
 since its filing 
can render it moot
.
[61]
 
 As explained, the present petition 
was not moot
 when it was 
filed
. It 
has not been rendered moot
 by changes in circumstances. Assuming 
without conceding
 that it has become moot, the 
negative collateral consequences
 apply to support this Court's action 
on the merits
. 
 The 
exception
 for 
negative collateral consequences
 means what it says: negative collateral consequences are likely to result from the action being reviewed. This exception is based on the premise that â 
 
 x x x the Court should still consider a case â even if it no longer involves a live controversy â 
if the action challenged by the appellant will continue to pose negative consequences for the appellant if it is not addressed
. It is a 
natural extension of the concept
 that "[t]he central question of all mootness problems is '
whether decision
 of a once living dispute 
continues to be justified by a sufficient prospect
 that the 
decision will have an impact on the parties
."' For example, we have held that the exception applied in a mental health case in which an involuntary hospitalization order â which had expired â nevertheless could have resulted in "
legal disabilities
" and "
social stigmatization
" for the patient past its effective date. "[D]espite [the] appellant's continued hospitalization under an order for continued treatment, the 
negative collateral consequences
 of being 
initially adjudicated mentally ill
 and then 
involuntarily hospitalized
 may 
continue to plague
 [the] appellant 
with both legal disabilities
 and 
social stigmatization
."
[62]
 x x x (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 For the 
negative collateral consequences exception
 to apply, "the contemplated 
prospective 'impact on the parties'
 that justifies the exception must be 
specific to the claimant
.
[63]
 It may 
not
 be a 
generalized grievance shared widely among the public
. 
 Petitioners' case 
meets
 the 
negative collateral consequences exception
 because of these 
negative collateral consequences
: (i) their 
right to free speech
 continues to be 
chilled
 by the 
real and reasonable fear
 of complaint and prosecution, which arises from respondents' 
continuous assertion
 of the 
constitutionality
 and 
enforceability
 of Ordinance No. 7780; (ii) the 
legal disabilities
 and 
other collateral consequences
 resulting from the filing of the criminal complaint, its prosecution and the actions of the trial court; and (iii) the 
social stigmatization
 of being referred to as 
purveyors of smut 
and 
kindred terms
. 
 These 
negative collateral consequences
 are 
specific to petitioners
. They have actually 
suffered these consequences
. They may be shared with others 
similarly situated
, but 
these others
 are certainly 
not
 the sharedÂ­ widely-among- the-public-as-a-whole 
disqualified
 by the exception. The 
similarly situated
 is a 
very small
 and 
compact community
 of publishers engaged in the same erotic and benign expressions as petitioners. 
 In sum, the present petition is
 not moot
. But even assuming it has become moot, two (2) 
exceptions
 to mootness apply, as heretofore discussed. 
 
 
Three.
 Ordinance No. 7780 
may be challenged on its face
 on the ground of 
overbreadth even
 though it is a 
penal
 statute that seeks 
to punish alleged obscene and indecent expressions. 
 
 
 
I also respectfully submit that the 
ponencia
 was 
mistaken
 when it disallowed petitioners, 
facial challenge
 of Ordinance No. 7780 to insist only on an
 as-applied challenge
. 
 It has 
long
 been 
settled
 that a law 
impacting
 on speech or expression is
 reviewable
 not only on the basis of a 
plaintiff's own injuries
 but also upon its 
overbreadth
.
[64]
 
Willson v. City of Bel-Nor
[65]
 explained: 
 
 "
[A] law may be invalidated as overbroad
 if '
a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep
."' United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 473, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2010) (quoting Wash. State Orange v. Wash. State Repub. Party, 522 U.S. 442, 449 n.6 (2008)); Langford v. City of St. Louis, 2020 WL 1227347. at *6 (E.D. Mo. Mar. 5, 2020). "
The First Amendment doctrine of overbreadth is an exception to [the] normal rule regarding the standards for facial challenges.
" Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113; 118, 123 S. Ct. 2191, 156 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2003). "
[T]he overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights
 if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when 'judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'" City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 52, 119 S. Ct. 1849, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1999) (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973)). "
The aim of facial overbreadth analysis is to eliminate the deterrent or 'chilling' effect an overbroad law may have on those contemplating conduct protected by the First Amendment
." Turchick v. United States, 561 F.2d 719, 721 (8th Cir. 1977). 
 
 
 To stress, the 
overbreadth
 doctrine exists "to 
prevent the chilling of future
 protected expression."
[66]
 Therefore, any law imposing 
restrictions so broad that it chills speech outside the purview of its legitimate
 regulatory purpose will be 
struck down
.
[67]
 For the same reason, petitioners would "have standing to challenge the Ordinance's overbreadth 
even though they do not dispute that the Ordinance applies to each of them
." The 
overbreadth
 doctrine 
constitutes an exception to traditional rules of standing
 and 
allows claimants to assert the rights of parties not before the court
."
[68]
 
 To conclude, the assailed Ordinance, as it criminalizes certain forms of speech, may be 
challenged on its face
 on the ground of
 overbreadth
 as a
 free speech or expression issue
. More, since the Ordinance is a 
content-based criminalization
, it is 
presumptively unconstitutional
 and 
may only be validated
 if it passes the 
strict scrutiny test
. 
 
 
Four.
 As Ordinance No. 7780 may be challenged 
facially, on its face
, it violates freedom of expression for being 
overbroad
, and as a 
content-based criminalization
, the 
strict scrutiny test
. 
 
 
 
 
a. Overbreadth 
 
 
 
 First, I discuss the objection on the 
overbreadth
 of Ordinance No. 7780. 
 A three-part test is used to determine whether a statute is unconstitutionally overbroad.
[69]
 Thus: 
 
 "The 
first step
 in 
overbreadth analysis
 is to
 construe the challenged statute
; it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first 
knowing what the statute covers
." Snider v. City of Cape Girardeau, 752 F.3d 1149, 1158 (8th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285. 293, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008)). "
After construing
 the statute, the 
second step
 is to 
examine whether the statute criminalizes a 'substantial amount' of expressive conduct
." Id., citing Williams, 553 U.S. at 292).
 Third
, courts must "
ask whether
 [*20] 
the statute is readily susceptible to a limiting construction which would render it constitutional
." (Id., citing Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S. Ct. 636, 98 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1988)). (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 The Ordinance's 
expansive
 definition of what is 
obscene
 â the 
particularized messages
 targeted by the Ordinance are 
indecency, eroticism, lewdness, offensiveness to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind, calculation to excite impure imagination or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, unfitness to be seen or heard
, or
 violation of the proprieties of language or behavior 
â and its 
criminalization
 of the 
printing, publishing, distributing, circulating
 and/or 
selling
 of these materials or acts 
on account of 
these 
contents
 or 
messages
, applies to a 
substantial amount of expressive conduct
. The Ordinance is 
not vague
. It is 
clear as to its meanings and implications
. But it is 
overbroad
. 
 I can 
illustrate
 numerous examples of expressive conduct that the Ordinance prohibits 
beyond what it should only be criminalizing
: 
 Rigoberto Tiglaoâs op-ed entitled "Did Jesus Exist?"
[70]
 This appears to be 
offensive to religious beliefs
. Mr. Tiglao in fact prefaces his op-ed with this opening paragraph: "AT this time, when our culture, dominated for nearly four centuries by the Hispanic model of late-medieval Catholicism, imposes on us several days of contemplating the Christian Messiah, I dare post again a piece I wrote two years ago, discussing whether Christ did exist in the first place. Someday, sometime in your lives, you will have to choose: the Red or the Blue pill."
 Mr. Tiglao's op-ed "The Real Origins of Christmas."
[71]
 This appears to be 
offensive
 not just to religious beliefs but also 
to good customs, principles or doctrines
, one having a 
tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind
, characterized by 
unfitness to be seen or heard
, or 
violation of the proprieties of language or behavior
.
 Nadine Lustre's sexy photos published in ABS-CBN's 
Lifestyle
 webpage.
[72]
 The photos appear to be 
erotic
.
 Same-sex stories as narrated and depicted in the internet.
[73]
 They appear to be a 
smorgasbord
 of everything the Ordinance 
criminalizes
 â 
indecency, eroticism, lewdness, offensiveness to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind, calculation to excite impure imagination or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, unfitness to be seen or heard
, or 
violation of the proprieties of language or behavior
. 
 As illustrated in 
Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, Inc. v. Joyce
:
[74]
 
 
 As amici point out, 
critical portrayals of Muhammad outside a mosque
 or 
of the Pope outside a Catholic Church
 might well be considered 
profane or indecent by their audiences
. Others may find 
language using the name of holy figures as swear words not only disrespectful, but profane
 as well. Similar expressions in the near vicinity of a house of worship have the potential to disturb or disquiet those present for worship. The meaning of "profane," or irreverence to the sacred, is 
not a well defined legislative term familiar to people of different faiths. Any silent demonstration outside a house of worship would likely be able to create a disturbance
 only by the content of its message. 
Even expression that may be perceived as offensive, rude, or disruptive remains protected by the First Amendment.
 
 
 
Some of the messages which appellants seek to communicate may well be considered rude and offensive by their target audience.
 The very topics which the record indicates appellants wish to address, including 
sexual abuse and the concealment of such crimes, can elicit strong emotional responses whether from clergy accused of wrongdoing
, victims of abuse and their supporters, or church members. Others may take exception to the demonstrations by Call to Action advocating for the 
ordination of women and church acceptance of gay, lesbian, and transgender people
. (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 Any movie or video featuring a single shot of a person's nude or partially-covered buttocks or a woman's partially covered breast is an 
obscene material or act
 under the Ordinance, irrespective of whether the content constitutes "adult entertainment" or causes the type of secondary effects, such as crime (sexual and nonsexual) and public health risks, that any government may seek to regulate.
[75]
 
 A painting of a nude person or several nude persons. 
Compelling narration in a court decision of sexual acts. 
 
 Any
 enlightened
 court would find these examples to illustrate that Ordinance No. 7780 creates a "prohibition of alarming breadth."
[76]
 Making things even more problematical is the fact the the 
ponencia
 
did not identify
 the 
compelling state interests
 that the Ordinance would want to pursue and accomplish. Thus, the Ordinance is 
overbroad
 and 
facially invalid
 because the 
impermissible applications
 of the law are 
substantial
 when judged 
in relation to its plainly legitimate sweep
 if at all. 
 Further, the Ordinance is 
not readily susceptible to a limiting construction
 because it would have to be rewritten in order to conform to constitutional requirements.
[77]
 Indeed: 
 
 The courts do not rewrite laws in these circumstances, as this would invade the "legislative domain." (citing Stevens, 559 U.S. at 481); Snider, 752 F.3d at 1158 ("No limiting construction would be consistent with any plausible understanding of the legislature's intent"). "Limiting constructions of state and local legislation are more appropriately done by a state court or an enforcement agency." Willson, 924 F.3d at 1004 (quoting Ways v. City of Lincoln, 274 F.3d 514, 519 (8th Cir. 2001)).
[78]
 
 
 
 The 
free expression rights of adults
 are 
not the same as
 or 
identical to
 the 
free speech rights 
vis-Ã -vis
 minors
. "In evaluating the free speech rights of adults," the United States Supreme Court has "made it perfectly clear that '
sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is protected
 by the First Amendment."
[79]
 Also, "[s]peech 
within the rights of adults to hear
 may 
not be silenced completely
 in an attempt 
to shield children from it
."
[80]
 
 Here, there is 
nothing
 in Ordinance No. 7780 which limits its scope to any 
established criminal practice
, much less to, for example, the transmission of harmful material to a minor with the intent of facilitating the sexual exploitation of the minor. The Ordinance is 
actually very broad
 in scope when it comes to 
online speech
, notably, the assailed FHM magazines that have been transformed into 
digital
 editions. The Ordinance is 
especially offensive
 to 
free expression
 in the 
digital platform
 because it 
forces every speaker on the internet
 in every state or community anywhere in the Philippines or even the world 
to abide by the alleged prevailing community standards of the City of Manila
, even if the 
online speech
 would 
not be found harmful in any other
 location. Truly: 
 
 To paraphrase the Supreme Court, it is 
neither realistic nor constitutionally sound
 to read the First Amendment as 
forcing the people
 of New York City or San Francisco 
to restrict their speech to abide by what is deemed acceptable speech
 in Vermont. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 32, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419, 93 S. Ct. 2607 (1973). "
People in different States vary in their tastes and attitudes and this diversity
 is not to be strangled by the absolutism of imposed uniformity. x x x"
[81]
 (Emphases supplied) 
 
 
 Ordinance No. 7780 
also lacks "
practical
 safe harbors or exceptions"
[82]
 for most publishers. With the exception of "
materials printed, distributed, exhibited, sold, filmed, rented, viewed, or produced by reason of or in connection with or in furtherance of science and scientific research and medical or medically related art, profession, and for educational purposes
," the Ordinance 
applies to an entities and individuals
 that communicate the 
prohibited messages
 on 
whatever platform
. Thus, the Ordinance "effectively drives protected and valuable speech for adults out of the 'marketplace of ideas."'
[83]
 
 
 b. Content-Based and Strict scrutiny 
 
 
 
 The constitutionality of a restriction on speech depends in large part on whether it is 
content-based
 and thus subject to the 
most exacting
 or 
strict scrutiny
, or a 
content-neutral time, place, manner
 or 
secondary effects
 regulation subject to intermediate scrutiny.
[84]
 
 To recall, 
content-based
 laws are those that target speech based on its communicative content. As already explained above, 
Ordinance No. 7780
 is a 
content-based criminalization
 of 
overly broad
 forms of speech. It defines 
obscenity
 based on the message the subject material or act conveys and then subjects each category to varying criminal penalties. It is also 
content-based
 because 
enforcement authorities must determine
[85]
 whether a material or act evokes 
indecency, eroticism, lewdness, offensiveness to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind, calculation to excite impure imagination or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, unfitness to be seen or heard, or violation of the proprieties of language or behavior.
 
 Because the Ordinance is a 
content-based
 prohibition, it 
must satisfy strict scrutiny
 regardless of the City of Manila's "benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of 'animus toward the ideas contained' in the [prohibited] speech."
[86]
 They are 
presumptively unconstitutional
. They may be 
justified only if
 the 
government proves
 that they are 
narrowly tailored
 to serve 
compelling state interests
. If the restriction is 
not narrowly tailored
 to achieve a 
compelling interest
, it is an 
unconstitutional restraint
 on free speech.
[87]
 
 There is 
nothing on record 
about the government interests sought to be advanced by Ordinance No. 7780. If it was meant to 
curb prurient interests
 or 
patently offensive sexual conduct
, the 
broad sweep
 of 
the
 messages it criminalizes â 
indecency, eroticism, lewdness, offensiveness to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines, tendency to corrupt or depr[a]ve the human mind, calculation to excite impure imagination or stimulate sexual drive or impure imagination or arouse prurient interest, unfitness to be seen or heard, or violation of the proprieties of language or behavior
 â are 
not narrowly tailored
 to meet its objectives. 
 These 
messages
 may capture even 
contrarian ideas
 simply because they offend others and may be interpreted by them as 
indecent, erotic, lewd, offensive to morals, good customs, religious beliefs, principles or doctrines
, etc. The Ordinance therefore runs a 
substantial risk
 of 
suppressing ideas
 in the process, as it 
impermissibly
 requires enforcement authorities to 
look into the content of the speaker's message
 in order to enforce it. This is 
not permissible
. The right to free expression 
guarantees
 that the government 
ought not to prohibit
 and 
inhibit
 the expression of an idea merely because 
society finds the idea itself offensive
 or 
disagreeable
.
[88]
 
 It must also be stressed that: 
 
 The 
tailoring requirement
 does not simply 
guard against
 an impermissible 
desire to censor
. The government may 
attempt to suppress speech
 not only because 
it disagrees
 
with
 the message being expressed, but also for 
mere convenience
. [B]y demanding a close fir between ends and means, the tailoring requirement 
prevents the government from too readily sacrificing speech for efficiency
.
[89]
 
 
 
 Here, the approach of Ordinance No. 7780 
to lump together everything contrarian
 under the criminal term 
obscene
 manifests its 
overwhelming
 intention 
not only
 to 
censor ideas disagreed
 with, 
but also
 to use the 
most convenient mode
 of doing so, that is, by 
banning
 and 
criminalizing everything
 not to a complainant's or the Ordinance enforcer's liking. 
 The Ordinance also 
fails strict scrutiny analysis
 because respondents have failed to demonstrate 
why a less restrictive provision would not be as effective
 in addressing the goal of curbing prurient interest and patently offensive sexual conduct.
[90]
 There are 
several other criminal statutes
 that are 
potentially less restrictive alternatives
 to Ordinance No. 7780. Although 
very insistent
 on the 
continuing validity
 and 
enforceability
 of this Ordinance, the Office of the City Prosecutor was in fact able to identify provisions in the RPC that appear to be 
narrowly tailored
 to suppressing prurient and patently offensive sexual conduct. 
 "When First Amendment compliance is the point to be proved, the risk of non-persuasion â operative in all trials â must rest with the Government, not with the citizen."
[91]
 The Ordinance remains 
presumptively invalid
, and this presumption 
has not been rebutted
 here because the Ordinance has drawn content-based distinctions that are not necessary to achieve the asserted interest against prurient and patently offensive sexual conduct. 
 
 
Five
. 
As applied to petitioners
, Ordinance No. 7780 has 
violated their freedom of expression
 when it sought to prohibit and penalize their acts of printing, publishing, distributing, circulating and/or selling 
certain identified issues or editions of FHM Magazine. 
 
 
 
An 
as-applied challenge
 consists of a challenge to the law's application 
only as-applied
 to the party before the court.
[92]
 To prevail, a plaintiff must show that the law is unconstitutional 
because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of his or her case
.
[93]
 
 For the same reasons discussed with respect to 
facial overbreadth
 and 
failed strict scrutiny
, Ordinance No. 7780 has the 
effect of unconstitutionally circumscribing
 petitioners' free speech 
as-applied
 to the assailed FHM magazines. For sure, not all of their expressive content would be 
unprotected speech
. But unfortunately, the 
standards
 set forth in the Ordinance are 
so broad
 that they prohibit and criminalize even those portions in petitioners' magazines that are 
protected speech
. The Ordinance is 
incapable
 of 
distinguishing
 between 
protected
 and 
unprotected
 speech. As a result of this sweeping coverage, the 
entirety
 of the 
content
 of petitioners' magazines is 
deemed criminal
 by the Ordinance 
simply because
 they are 
offensive to the religious beliefs
 of the pastors and preachers who filed the criminal complaint and what they deem to be the 
appropriate language and behavior
. 
 In any event, I 
do not find
 the assailed issues or editions of FHM Magazine to be 
obscene
 or in any other manner 
unprotected
 by the right to free expression. 
As-applied
 to these magazines, Ordinance No. 7780 
unconstitutionally
 curtails petitioners' free speech. 
 The prevailing test of obscenity in our jurisdiction
[94]
 is founded upon 
Miller v. California
.
[95]
 Under 
Miller
, the basic guidelines to determine whether a work is obscene and, therefore, subject to state regulation, are as follows: 
 
 (a) whether "the average person, applying contemporary community standards" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
 
 
 All three prongs of the 
Miller
 test must be satisfied for a work to be found obscene.
[96]
 
 The key terms in the 
Miller
 test have been explained in this manner: 
 
 1. Community Standards 
 
 
 Analysis of obscenity under the Miller test looks to 
local, as opposed to national, community standards
. The 
"community standards" test
 seeks to ensure that jurors assess the potentially obscene material 
from the point of view of an average person, not the most sensitive member
 of the community. The court or the jury can define the relevant community. The community can include a state as large as California or a small, rural community in Georgia. Thus, First Amendment protection might be afforded in New York to materials deemed obscene, and therefore prohibited, in Maine. 
 
 Despite the apparent repudiation of a national standards test in Miller, the Supreme Court has 
allowed courts to apply both national and local standards of decency
. In Hamling v. United States, the Court stated that the purpose of the community standards test was "
to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror's personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group
." Referencing national standards as well as community standards fulfilled this goal. Further, when instructing jurors on the community standards test, courts are not required to define which community jurors should consider. Both parties 
may choose to use expert witnesses to help explain what the community standard should be
; however, that determination is ultimately left up to the juror. 
 
 The interaction between obscene speech and the Internet also creates interesting problems in determining community standards. For example, 
when obscenity is posted to the internet it cannot be prevented from entering any community
. Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit 
has applied the standard of the local community in which the materials are received
 rather than a national community standard. In effect, this means if distributors of sexual material wish to receive First Amendment protection, 
they must comply with the community standards where the materials are disseminated
. However, more recently, the Ninth Circuit has interpreted the plurality in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union to give us a clearer way in how to define community standards. In United States v. Kilbride, the court followed the position of the Justices who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds. The court concluded that Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer's concurrences in the judgment were the correct standards to follow, and that a national community standard must be used to determine obscene material on the Internet. Justice O'Connor reasoned that "
given internet speakers' inability to control the geographic location of their audience, expecting them to bear the burden of controlling the recipients of their speech
, as we did in Hamling and Sable, 
may be entirely too much to ask
, and 
would potentially suppress an inordinate amount of expression
" and that a national community standard would avoid this First Amendment problem. Justice Breyer reasoned that 
a local community standard
 would "
provide the most puritan of communities with a heckler's Internet veto affecting the rest of the Nation
." 
 
 2. Prurient Interest 
 
 
 Before Miller, the Supreme Court defined "
prurient"
 as "
material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts
" including "
itching; longing; uneasy with desire or longing . . . lascivious desire or thought
."
 Prurient interest
, as used in the Miller test, is understood as "
that which appeals to shameful or morbid interest in sex
." Triers of fact 
need not be aroused
 by material to judge it prurient. Instead, they 
merely need to determine whether the material in question would appeal to a member of the target group in a prurient manner 
and 
is intended to arouse members of the target group
. Triers of fact have recognized that 
not all nudity appeals to a prurient interest
; 
alternative lifestyles
, such as that of a nudist, sometimes encompass materials that 
do not necessarily appeal to a prurient interest
. 
 
 3. Patently Offensive 
 
 
 Miller did not require states to define "patently offensive" in a uniform way. In fact, many obscenity statutes "
[go] substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation
." The Miller Court explained that "
patently offensive
," for example, could 
include "representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated x x x [or] masturbation, excretory functions, [and] a lewd exhibition of the genitals
." Some states have included sexual acts not mentioned in Miller, such as 
bestiality, sadomasochism
, and 
sexual bondage
. These additions have been found to be permissible examples of "patently offensive" behavior that states may restrict or ban as obscene. 
 
 4. Societal Value 
 
 
 
Sexually explicit materials
 that 
have
 "
serious literary, artistic, political
, or 
scientific value
" when 
viewed as a whole
 receive full First Amendment protection under Miller, according some protection for sexual materials with societal value. 
Context is important
 in this determination. For example, "
medical books
 for the education of physicians and related personnel" with explicit illustrations and descriptions are protected. Also, 
videogames with fleeting nudity
 can be protected. In Entertainment Software Ass'n v. Blagojevich, the court held that the video game God of War was essentially an interactive version of Homer's Odyssey, and its fleeting nudity in one scene should be protected because
 the game as a whole has literary value for the youths who play
 it. In contrast, merely putting a quotation from a famous author in the flyleaf of a book does not render it a work of serious literature such that it will merit full First Amendment protection.
[97]
 
 
 
 The assailed FHM magazines do 
not
 exhibit
 any
 of these three prongs. 
 For one, the assailed FHM magazine 
contains both texts and pictures
 that 
cover a variety of general interest topics
 â women, pop culture, fashion and grooming, sports, music, movies, gadgets, sex and relationship, and humor. The 
magazines have edgy photos
 of women in various stages of undress but not totally nude, but nudity per se, much less sexy pictorials, is 
not obscenity
. To the average person using contemporary community standards, especially when each page of an issue of the magazine is read with its other pages and the other issues or editions of the magazines in toto, the magazines
 cannot be adjudged
 as pandering solely to 
prurient
 interests. 
 Neither do the magazines depict 
sexual conduct in a patently offensive
 manner. 
United States v. Various Articles of Merch
.
[98]
 has explained this 
second prong
 as follows: 
 
 The Supreme Court emphasized in Miller that "no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials
 unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive 'hard core' sexual conduct
." The Court, recognizing the difficulty and the dangers of attempting to regulate any form of expression,
 gave a few examples of what a state statute could define for regulation
 under part (b) of the Miller standard: 
 
 (a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated. 
 
 (b) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals. 
 
 x x x x 
 
 
 In 
Fernando v. Court of Appeals
,
[99]
 this Court adopted the foregoing formulation of patently offensive to define this phrase and prevent unbridled discretion in its invocation. 
 The
 photographs
 in the assailed magazines 
do not depict private parts at all
. Though there are photographs of women and at times men 
in various stages of undress
, their 
private parts
, however, are 
not exposed
. Neither of these private parts is being exhibited nor being shown off. While their bodies,
 including provocative imaginings
 or 
inciting to sensual imagination
 of their private parts, are the
 focal point
 of the photos, the fact remains that 
none
 of these photos 
actually shows off
 the model's private parts. 
At a minimum
, the 
exposure
 of one's private parts would be 
necessary
 to aggravate the images as being 
patently offensive sexual conduct
. 
 
Nor 
can I conclude that the magazines depict or describe patently offensive
 hard core
 sexual conduct. Nudity, much less near nudity is 
not
 
enough
 to make the magazines legally obscene under the
 Miller
 standards. We
 need more than nudity 
to up the ante. Unfortunately, there are no
 explicit sexual positions
 on display. Only the 
titillating pictures and postures
 and
 sultry looks
 are all there is to even suggest that the materials are obscene. The magazines thus
 fall far outside
 the zone of 
hardcore sexual conduct
 that may constitutionally be found to be 
patently offensive
. 
 The
 final prong
 of the 
Miller
 test, as stated, is 
whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value
. 
 The assailed FHM magazines possess 
political value
. "The term '
political
' which we employ here is
 broad enough to encompass
 that which 
might tend to bring about 'political and social changes
."'
[100]
 The magazines espouse 
alternative lifestyles
 and 
alternative communities
, which celebrate 
sexuality
 and
 sensuality 
as acceptable behavior, values and mindset. It is true that the political value of these magazines is not as immediately evident as the political value of, say, the 
Economist
 or the 
Political Science Review
. "However, publications dedicated to presenting a visual depiction of an alternative lifestyle, a depiction with a decidedly Utopian flavor, have political value similar to the political value of articles criticizing government regulation of that and other lifestyles."
[101]
 
 I would suggest that the subject FHM magazines do not even reach the status of an 
indecent speech
, which at any rate is a category of 
protected speech
: 
 
 
Indecent speech is protected
 by the First Amendment 
but is disfavored and may be regulated. Indecent speech
, while not defined by the Supreme Court, has been explained by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
as that which "in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards
 x x x
 sexual or excretory activities or organs
." The FCC uses a
 contextual balancing test of three factors
 when looking at broadcast material to determine 
whether or not it is indecent
: "
(1) whether the description or depiction is explicit or graphic, (2) whether that material dwells on or repeats at length descriptions or depictions of sexual or excretory organs,
 and 
(3) whether the material appears to pander or is used to titillate or shock
." Thus, unlike obscene speech, 
indecent speech need not appeal to the prurient interest
 or 
lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value in order to be regulated. 
 
 The First Amendment 
protects sexual speech not rising to the level of obscenity, but provides less protection than it does for more valuable forms of speech
. The Supreme Court has explained that: 
 
 [E]ven though we recognized that the First Amendment will 
not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials
 x x x 
society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different
, and
 lesser, magnitude
 than the interest in untrammeled political debate x x x Whether political oratory or philosophical discussion moves us to applaud or to despise what is said, every school child can understand why our duty to defend the right to speak remains the same. But 
few of us would march our sons and daughters off to war to preserve the citizen's right to see "Specified Sexual Activities"
 exhibited in the theaters of our choice. 
 
 
 Generally, when the government regulates speech on the basis of its indecent content, courts must apply strict scrutiny.
[102]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
Sexual speech
 is a specie of indecent speech.
[103]
 It is disfavored but still 
protected
. On the other hand, free speech does 
not protect obscenity
. The government may ban or regulate it. But it must do so narrowly. Laws that prohibit 
obscenity
 may be found unconstitutional if they 
potentially prohibit an excessive amount of non-obscene speech
.
[104]
 
Private possession
 of obscene materials is
 generally protected
, while distribution and transmission of such materials is not.
[105]
 
 The subject FHM magazines are 
benign
 expressions of sexuality and sensuality. They are 
playful flirtations
 with 
beauty
 and 
sexiness
. But they are 
not obscene
 by 
Miller
's standards. 
Neither
 are they even 
indecent expression
 as defined by the United States' Federal Communications Commission. Thus,
 as applied
 to these magazines, the Ordinance has 
violated petitioners' free speech
 when it was used to prohibit and penalize, as well as shame and bring opprobrium to, their acts of printing, publishing, distributing, circulating and/or selling these protected magazines. 
 
TOWARDS A MORE INCLUSIVE OBSCENITY AND OTHER SEXUAL 
 SPEECH TEST
 
 
 A final point. I agree with the learned Associate Justice Marvic F. Leonen that the 
constitutional protection 
given to 
sexual speech
 has ridden the crest of the 
commodification of women
, the
 sexual gratification of the heterosexual male specie
, and the 
dehumanization and demonization of the
 other
 
(
female, lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer
) 
bodies
. I find it both 
funny
 and 
disconcerting
 that in defining the 
obscene
 and
 indecent
, the 
puerileness
 of the expression to the male penis or its exposure of the
 female 
nipple has been the standard of constitutional protection. Justice Leonen could be correct that this jurisprudential development is 
largely a reflection
 of the communities we live in â the rise and power of the 
macho
 society within and outside of the family and into institutions of power and authority, the courts included. 
 Helen Longino
[106]
 describes the sexual speech that has
 also
 greatly benefitted from the constitutional protection to free speech: 
 
 
Pornography
 lies when it says that 
our sexual life is or ought to be subordinate to the service of men
, that our pleasure consists 
in pleasing men and not ourselves
, that we are depraved, that we are fit subjects for rape, bondage, torture, and murder ... [this] fosters more lies about our humanity, our dignity, and our personhood. (Emphases supplied) 
 
 
Catherine MacKinnon explains, 
sexual expression causes harm
 not because it leads to a particular violent act against women; rather, the 
harm of sexual expression
 lies in its 
negative impact on a consumer's understanding of gender and sexuality
 â it generates 
a social environment in which women are devalued
 and in which 
sex is eroticized violence
 by which 
men seek gratification
.
[107]
 
 
 Andrea Dworkin
[108]
 would thus advocate: 
 
 The 
oppression of women 
occurs through
 sexual subordination
. It is the
 use of sex as the medium of oppression
 that
 makes the subordination of women
 so distinct from racism or prejudice against a group based on religion or national origin. Social inequality is created in many different ways x x x the
 radical responsibility
 is to 
isolate the material means of creating the inequality
 so that material remedies can be found for it. (Emphases supplied) 
 
 
 The 
Miller 
test references
 community standards
 and
 societal values
. The question is the
 locus 
of these standards and values. Upon whose standards and values do we anchor what is obscene and what is not obscene, what is protected and what is unprotected? It is said that the standards and values should be that of the
 average person
 â what was
 intolerable to the average member
 of the national community would determine
 obscenity
. 
 But the 
average person
 is also 
situated
 somewhere, sometime, and somehow. We 
do not live
 in homogenous communities. There will always be those who would be the 
majority
, the 
minority
, the 
marginalized
, and the 
underrepresented
 and 
unrepresented
. Substantive equality will have to account as well for their standards and values. 
 I believe that 
majoritarian community standards
 tolerate if not accept the materials and acts published in the challenged FHM magazines. The 
popularity 
and 
acceptability 
of this magazine as a whole are 
off-the-roof
. They are considered 
fashionable
 and
 rarely
 referred to as
 smut
. The magazines provide political, entertainment, and aesthetic values to the communities in which they are read. Therefore, the magazines 
should easily pass
 the 
Miller
 test. 
 But, I 
do not accept
 that 
what is 
tolerated
 and 
accepted
 by the majority is necessarily 
liberating
 and 
progressive
. We 
recognize
 as a
 rule of law
 the 
equality of the dignities and personhood
 of all peoples 
regardless
 of race, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity and other indicators of one's autonomy and actualization in society. The community standards test 
must account
 for these differences and 
allow for
 the distinctiveness of individuals and communities in our midst. 
 In place of the 
standards-of-the-community-of-the-average-person test
, I respectfully endorse the 
harm-based approach
 in assessing the community standards of tolerance.
[109]
 The approach requires the courts to determine using 
evidence
 about the
 harmful effects
 of the expression and
 inference
 from the expression itself "what the 
community
 would tolerate 
others
 being exposed to on the basis of the 
degree of harm
 [to the others] that may flow from such exposure."
[110]
 
 
Harm
 in this context has 
three types
: "(1) harm to those whose autonomy and liberty may be restricted by being confronted with inappropriate conduct; (2) harm to society by predisposing others to antiÂ­ social conduct; and (3) harm to individuals participating in the conduct."
[111]
 
 Harm may either be in the 
form 
of 
anti-social conduct
 or 
anti-social attitudes
.
[112]
 In terms of 
conduct
, "criminal law may 
limit conduct and expression
 in order
 to prevent people
 who may see it from becoming 
predisposed to acting in an anti-social manner
."
[113]
 As regards 
attitudinal harm
, the 
expression
 must be one (i) to which the 
public
 has been exposed and (ii) which "
perpetuates negative and demeaning images
 of humanity and is 
likely to undermine respect 
for members of the targeted groups and hence
 to predispose others to act
 in an anti-social manner towards them."
[114]
 
 The 
degree of harm
 that would necessitate regulation, prohibition or even criminalization, was
 assessed
 by ascertaining 
whether the material or conduct was
 "
incompatible with the proper functioning of society
."
[115]
 The 
threshold
 for establishing such a standard must be
 high
, since membership in a diverse society
 mandates tolerance
 of conduct or material of which one disapproves.
[116]
 
High
 means it must be "
objectively shown beyond a reasonable doubt 
to interfere with the proper functioning of society." 
 The 
proof of harm
 demands more than speculation and vague generalizations.
[117]
 There must be a
 real risk
 that the expression will cause any one of the types of harm â the sexual act or speech at issue will
 lead to attitudinal changes
 and hence
 to anti-social behaviour
.
[118]
 The
 causal link
 between images of sexuality 
and
 anti-social behaviour cannot be assumed; rather, a 
link
 must be established
 first between
 the sexual act or speech 
and
 the formation of negative attitudes,
 and second
 between those attitudes
 and
 real risk of antisocial behaviour.
[119]
 
Expert evidence 
may help to establish 
actual harm
, while the
 probability
 (
and not merely the possibility
) of the 
risk of harm
 may be shown from the act or expression itself. 
 In 
Regina v. Labaye
,
[120]
 the accused was charged with operating a "common bawdy-house," a violation under Section 210(1) of the 
Criminal Code
 of Canada, for owning the club, in which persons who paid membership fees and their guests could assemble and engage in group and oral sex and masturbate. These activities were consensual and, while members paid the club membership fees, the members did not pay each other in exchange for sex. In determining whether the accused was guilty of owning a bawdy-house, the Canadian Supreme Court had to decide 
whether the activities
 taking place within should be classified as 
indecent
, since 
bawdy-houses
 are, by definition, 
houses in which
 prostitution or 
indecency
 occurs or is planned to occur. The accused was found guilty. 
 The Canadian Supreme Court acquitted the accused. Using the harm-based approach in arriving at the community standards of tolerance, the Court found 
no evidence 
that the degree of alleged harm rose to the
 level of incompatibility with the proper functioning 
of society. It held that consensual
 conduct behind code-locked doors
 can 
hardly
 be supposed to 
jeopardize 
society. 
Nothing
 was involved that encouraged 
sexist 
and 
misogynist 
attitudes. The sex was consensual and
 not prostitution
. The threat of sexually transmitted diseases are more of a health issue than a harm that comes exclusively from deviant sex. 
 The 
harm-based approach
 could help in pursuing 
inclusive 
community standards. It allows courts to consider 
all of the stakeholders
, not only the community of the average person, in a meaningful manner. 
 Admittedly, though,
 Labaye
 was decided the way it did on the ground that 
no harm to others 
that the community would have been 
unwilling
 to tolerate and accept happened. The 
cognitive lens 
was still the perspective of the 
others
, and not the 
autonomy
 of the participants in the bawdy-house. Indeed, the "swingers might have been more concerned that the practice at issue was central to the way in which they lived their lives â to their actualization in society."
[121]
 
 Further: 
 
 Rather than recognizing the integral nature of the practice to the aggrieved community and then utilizing that affirmative principle to buttress the right to practice the lifestyle, the Court instead arrives at its conclusion by considering the negative implications of swinging as a lifestyle. The underlying messages are that swinging appeals to base interests, that the average member of society is not likely to suffer, and that swingers are not harmed since they are already attitudinally changed; therefore the practice in the case at bar was permissible. 
 
 The focus does not consider all of the stakeholders in a meaningful manner, most notably the beliefs of the aggrieved swingers. The members outside of mainstream society were analyzed as "others" and were left to behave as they wished so long as "our" interests were not harmed.
[122]
 
 
 
 Just the same, the 
harm-based approach
 can be enriched "with a 
multitude of variables
 that would fully situate the harm analysis in a contextually sensitive manner."
[123]
 In determining 
whether the sexual act
 
or speech is harmful
 as it
 unduly exploits sex 
and would be
 accepted 
or 
tolerated
 by society, the 
harms test
 may take into account factors such as the sex, race, age, disability, and sexual orientation of the participants; the purposes of the materials; the intended audience, the existence of real or apparent violence; the existence of consent; the nature of the publication, including the relationship of the impugned materials to the entirety of the publication; the framework and manner of production, distribution and consumption; and the benefits to viewers and readers from the production and dissemination of the materials.
[124]
 
 Arguably, an 
enriched harm-based
 context would satisfy the
 concerns for equality 
and 
against stereotyping and discrimination
. This would be the case in the context of sexually explicit materials that challenge the dominant heterosexual male perspective and are enriched by factors that are tailored to account for members of the 
other
 communities. 
 I am aware that developments in jurisprudence as remedies to societal inequities 
take time
 to percolate, and the thoughts I have discussed 
would likely remain just
 that, idle 
thoughts
. In any event, the law is only one among many forums for change. As Brenda Cossman cautions, "while the law is busy trying to discipline these unruly sexual subjects, these sexual subjects are actually being normalized through other competing discourses."
[125]

., 601 Phil. 245 (2009). "Nonetheless, the issue is deemed seasonably raised because it is not the NLRC but the CA which has the competence to resolve the constitutional issue. The NLRC is a labor tribunal that merely performs a quasi-judicial function â its function in the present case is limited to determining questions of fact to which the legislative policy of R.A. No. 8042 is to be applied and to resolving such questions in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself; thus, its foremost function is to administer and enforce R.A. No. 8042, and not to inquire into the validity of its provisions." Also,
