[ G.R. No. 244115, February 03, 2021 ]


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF ANDRES FRANCISCO, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N






 Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to annul and set aside the Decision
[2]
 dated June 13, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated January 10, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 108050. The CA partially granted the Decision
[4]
 dated February 22, 2016 and the Order
[5]

 dated September 1, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Valenzuela
 City, Branch 172, in Civil Case No. 169-V-12. It remanded the case to 
the RTC for the proper determination of the just compensation and 
deleted the award of consequential damages and attorney's fees for lack 
of adequate factual and legal bases. 

Essentially, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the 
Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH; petitioner), is 
questioning the CA's imposition of the interest rate of 12% per annum 
from the time of taking until June 30, 2013 considering that the subject
 lots were taken after the payment of the just compensation. 
The Facts


On October 19, 2012, petitioner filed a complaint for expropriation 
against Andres Francisco and Socorro Luna (spouses Francisco) for the 
acquisition of the 970.50-square meter (sq. m.) portion of Lot No. 
962-D-3-C-3
[6]
 and the 290-sq. m. portion of Lot No. 962-D-3-B,
[7]
 residential lots located in 
Barangay

 General T. De Leon, Valenzuela City, for the construction of the C-5 
Northern Link Road Project Phase 2 (Segment 9) from North Luzon 
Expressway to MacArthur Highway, Valenzuela City.
[8]
 

Upon their death, the spouses Francisco were substituted by their 
children Alejandro Francisco and Sonia Francisco Soriano (respondents).
[9]
 
On November 23, 2012, petitioner deposited with the RTC Land Bank of the
 Philippines (LBP) Manager's Check No. 698188 in the amount of 
P1,559,560.62, representing the equivalent of 100% of the cost of the 
improvements found in the subject lots. On December 13, 2012, it also 
deposited with the RTC LBP Manager's Check No. 1185752 in the amount of 
P2,647,050.00, representing the equivalent of 100% of the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) zonal value of the subject lots.
[10]
 

On February 8, 2013, the RTC issued a Writ of Possession in favor of petitioner.
[11]
 
On April 17, 2013, the RTC ordered the replacement of the LBP manager's 
checks after they became stale while in the trial court's custody.
[12]
On August 29, 2013 and February 21, 2014, petitioner issued the replacement checks
[13]
 and deposited the same with the trial court.

On June 20, 2013, the parties agreed to execute a compromise agreement to determine the valuation of the subject properties.
[14]
 
On February 3, 2014, respondents declared that they are no longer amenable to enter into a compromise agreement.
[15]


On August 7, 2014, the parties manifested that they would dispense with 
the referral of the case to the Board of Commissioners for the 
determination of the just compensation and thereafter submitted their 
respective position papers.
[16]


In their position paper, respondents claimed that they should be paid 
the just compensation computed at P7,500.00 per sq. m. and P1,000,000.00
 as consequential damages. But petitioner countered that the just 
compensation should be fixed at P400.00 per sq. m. and P2,100.00 per sq.
 m. Petitioner likewise prayed that the amount of P1,559,560.62 
representing the replacement cost of the subject improvements be 
considered as the full settlement of the just compensation thereon.
[17]


The Ruling of the RTC


On February 22, 2016, the RTC rendered a Decision
[18]
 with the dispositive portion as follows:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered fixing the just 
compensation of the total subject of 1,260.50 square meters lot of the 
defendants in the amount of SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PESOS 
(Php7,500.00) per square meter or in the total amount of NINE MILLION 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS 
(Php9,453,750.00), and authorizing the payment thereof by the plaintiff 
to the defendants for the property condemned, deducting the provisional 
deposit previously, made and subject to the payment of all unpaid 
property taxes and other relevant taxes, by the defendant up to the 
filing of the complaint, if there be any.

The plaintiff is also directed to pay defendants the amount of ONE 
MILLION PESOS (Php 1,000,000.00) by way of consequential damages and ONE
 HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php100,000.00) as attorney's fees.

The plaintiff is ordered to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum on
 the unpaid balance of just compensation on the lot, as well as the 
damages, computed from the time of the taking of the property until July
 1, 2013 and thereafter the rate of 6% per annum shall apply until the 
same shall have been paid in full, as per BSP Circular No. 799.


SO ORDERED.
[19]


The RTC pegged the amount of just compensation at P7,500.00 per sq. m. 
taking into account its decisions in similar expropriation cases 
involving residential properties in Gen. T. De Leon, Valenzuela City. In
 2007 and 2008, the RTC fixed the just compensation in condemnation 
proceedings between P3,000.00 to P5,000.00 per sq. m. It opined that 
petitioner's valuation at P400.00 and P2,100.00 per sq. m. for the 
subject lots cannot be applied in a complaint for expropriation filed in
 2012.
[20]


Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied in an Order
[21]
 dated September 1, 2016. 
The Ruling of the CA


On June 13, 2018, the CA rendered a Decision, the 
fallo
 of which reads:


WHEREFORE, the present appeal is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The February 22, 2016 
Decision
 and its subsequent September 1, 2016 
Order in Civil Case No. 169-V-12
,
 is hereby MODIFIED as follows:
 a. This case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Valenzuela
 City, Branch 172, for the proper determination of just compensation in 
conformity with this Decision. To forestall any farther delay in the 
resolution of the case, the trial court is ordered to make the 
determination within six (6) months from receipt of this Decision and 
afterwards to report to this Court its compliance thereon.


b. From the date of taking of the property on February 8, 2013 until 
June 30, 2013, the unpaid balance of the just compensation to be 
determined by the trial court shall earn interest at 12% 
per annum
. From July 1, 2013 until the finality of the decision fixing the just compensation, the legal interest shall be 6% 
per annum
. The total amount due shall earn a straight 6% 
per annum

 interest from the finality of the decision fixing the just compensation
 until full payment.


c. The trial court's award of consequential damages and attorney's fees 
are hereby DELETED for lack of adequate factual and legal bases.


SO ORDERED.
[22]


The CA remanded the case to the RTC because of the absence of reliable 
and actual data as bases in fixing the value of the condemned 
properties. It declared that the RTC seemed to have overlooked that the 
classification and use for which the properties are suited are not the 
only criteria for the determination of the just compensation.


The CA upheld the 12% interest imposed by the RTC on the unpaid balance
 of the just compensation clarifying that it should be reckoned from the
 time of taking, which is on February 8, 2013. The 12% per annum 
interest rate applies until June 30, 2013 and, thereafter, the interest 
rate shall be at 6% per annum.
[23]


The CA deleted the award of consequential damages for failure of 
respondents to present substantive evidence that the remaining 
unaffected properties had suffered an impairment amounting to 
P1,000.000.00. Further, the award of attorney's fees is deleted because 
of the lack of proof of malice or bad faith to justify its imposition.
[24]


Petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the June 13, 2018 CA Decision, but the same was denied in a Resolution
[25]
 dated January 10, 2019. 
The Arguments of the Parties


Petitioner argues that the subject lots were taken after the payment of 
the just compensation. Since there was no delay in the payment of the 
value of the condemned properties, it asserts that the CA erred in 
holding it liable to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the 
unpaid balance of the just compensation computed from the time of taking
 until July 1, 2013, and thereafter, at the rate of 6% per annum. It 
invokes the Court's ruling in the case of 
Republic v. Soriano
[26]

 that the payment of legal interest in expropriation cases only applies 
when the property was taken prior to the deposit of payment with the 
court and only to the extent that there is delay in payment. It further 
maintains that assuming, without conceding, that respondents are 
entitled to the payment of legal interest, the same should only be at 
the rate of 6% per annum in accordance with Article 2209
[27]

 of the Civil Code.


Respondents, on the other hand, counter that the just compensation in 
expropriation cases earns interest and that petitioner is liable 
therefor. Citing 
Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic
,
[28]

 they contend that that interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due 
if there is no full compensation for the expropriated property, as in 
this case where only the initial payment has been made. 
The Issue


Whether or not the award of interest on the unpaid compensation is proper. 
The Court's Ruling


The petition is denied. 

The power of eminent domain of the State is enshrined in Section 9, 
Article III of the 1987 Constitution which provides that "no private 
property shall be taken for public use without just compensation." While
 the power is inherent in nature and deeply ingrained in the exercise of
 sovereignty, limitations still exist to cushion the blow to an 
individual's right to property. Thus, no less than the Constitution 
requires that the purpose of taking must be for public use and that just
 compensation must be given to the owner of the private property.
[29]

 Clearly, the exercise of the right to reassert dominion over a private 
property pivots on the recognition of the State's authority to 
expropriate or condemn said property and the determination of the amount
 and the payment of just compensation, the latter being the 
crux
 
of the instant petition.

Jurisprudence defines just compensation as the full and fair equivalent 
of the property subject of expropriation. It is ascertained based on the
 owner's loss and not the taker's gain. Hence, to recoup the loss 
suffered by the owner of the private property, it is essential that the 
compensation be just such that the equivalent to be given for the 
property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample.
[30]
 Simply put, the just compensation in condemnation proceedings envisages timely or 
prompt payment in full
 of the just compensation 
as finally determined by the courts.
[31]
 In 
Republic v. Judge Mupas
,
[32]

 the Court explained that prompt payment must be made to the property 
owner so that he may derive income from both the condemned property and 
its income-generating potential. This is because the property owner 
suffers the immediate deprivation of both his land and its fruits or 
income. 

As to the manner of payment of the just compensation, Section 4 of 
Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8974
[33]
 instructs:


SEC. 4. 
Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings
. â 
Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property for the right-of-way 
or location for any national government infrastructure project through 
expropriation, the appropriate implementing agency shall initiate the 
expropriation proceedings before the proper court under the following 
guidelines:
(a) Upon the filing of the complaint, and after due notice to the 
defendant, 
the implementing agency shall 
immediately pay
 the 
owner of the property the amount equivalent to the sum of (1) one 
hundred percent (100%) of the value of the property based on the current
 relevant zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR); and 
(2) the value of the improvements and/or structures as determined under 
Section 7 hereof;
(b) In provinces, cities, municipalities and other areas where there is 
no zonal valuation, the BIR is hereby mandated within the period of 
sixty (60) days from the date of the expropriation case, to come up with
 a zonal valuation for said area; and


(c) In case the completion of a government infrastructure project is of 
utmost urgency and importance, and there is no existing valuation of the
 area concerned, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner
 of the property its proffered value taking into consideration the 
standards prescribed in Section 5 hereof.


Upon compliance
 with the guidelines [abovementioned], the 
court shall immediately issue to the implementing agency an order to take possession
 of the property and start the implementation of the project.
Before the court can issue a Writ of Possession, the implementing agency
 shall present to the court a certificate of availability of funds from 
the proper official concerned.

In the event that the owner of the property contests the implementing 
agency's proffered value, the court shall determine the just 
compensation to be paid the owner within sixty (60) days from the date 
of filing of the expropriation case. 
When the decision of the court becomes final and executory, the implementing agency shall 
pay the owner the difference
 between the amount already paid and the just compensation as determined by the court.
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)


In 
Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic
,
[34]

 the Court noted that the just compensation contemplated in R.A. No. 
8974 contemplates the completion of two payments to the property owner, 
to wit: (1) the initial payment of the amount equivalent to the sum of 
100% of the value of the property based on the current relevant BIR 
zonal valuation and the value of the improvements and/or structures 
thereon, which is made upon the filing of the complaint; and (2) the 
payment of the difference between the amount already paid and the just 
compensation as determined by the court, which is made after the trial 
court's decision becomes final and executory. Upon initial payment of 
the so-called provisional value of the condemned property, the court 
shall issue a writ of possession in order to provide the government the 
"flexibility to immediately take the property pending the court's final 
determination of just compensation"
[35]

 and commence the implementation of the infrastructure project. 

In the present case, the findings of the RTC and the CA showed that 
after the filing of the expropriation complaint, petitioner deposited 
the amounts of P1,559,560.62 and P2,647,050.00 which correspond to 100% 
of the cost of the improvements found on the subject lots and 100% of 
the value of the subject lots based on its BIR zonal valuation, 
respectively Thereafter, a writ of possession was issued in favor of 
petitioner. At this juncture, the full and fair equivalent of the 
properties have yet to be determined with finality by the court. On 
February 22, 2016, the RTC pegged the amount of just compensation at 
P7,500.00 per sq. m. or in the total amount of P9,453,750.00, exclusive 
of the amount of P1,000,000.00 as consequential damages which petitioner
 was directed to pay. Obviously, the amount of petitioner's initial 
deposit is much less than that adjudged by the RTC. Hence, petitioner 
must pay the difference between the final amount as fixed by the RTC and
 the initial payment made by petitioner coupled with legal interest as a
 forbearance of money, in line with 
Evergreen Manufacturing
.

Incidentally, the CA did not agree with the amounts fixed by the RTC as 
just compensation and ordered that the case be remanded for the proper 
determination of just compensation 
vis-Ã -vis
 all the standards for the assessment of the value of properties as provided in Section 5
[36]

 of R.A. No. 8974. Even so, petitioner must still pay the legal interest
 on the difference between the initial payment and the final amount of 
just compensation, to be adjudged by the RTC anew. The reason is not 
hard to discern. The variance between the final amount as fixed by the 
court and the initial payment is part and parcel of the just 
compensation that the property owner is entitled from the date of taking
 of the properties.


The Court enunciated in 
Republic v. Judge Mupas
:
[37]


Ideally, just compensation should be immediately made 
available to the property owner so that he may derive income from this 
compensation, in the same manner that he would have derived income from 
his expropriated property.

However, if full compensation is not paid for the property taken, then 
the State must pay for the shortfall in the earning potential 
immediately lost due to the taking, and the absence of replacement 
property from which income can be derived. 
Interest on the unpaid 
compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate 
on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness.


Thus, interest in eminent domain cases "runs as a matter of law and 
follows as a matter of course from the right of the landowner to be 
placed in as good a position as money can accomplish, as of the date of 
taking." (Emphasis supplied)


We echoed the above pronouncement in 
Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines
,
[38]
 where we expounded on the 
raison d'etre for the imposition of legal interest in the payment of just compensation
:


The award of interest is intended to 
compensate the 
property owner for the income it would have made had it been properly 
compensated for its property at the time of the taking
. "The need for prompt payment and the necessity of the payment of interest is to 
compensate for any 
delay
 in the payment of compensation for 
property already taken
."
 "The award of interest is imposed in the nature of damages for delay in
 payment which, in effect, makes the obligation on the part of the 
government one of forbearance to ensure prompt payment of the value of 
the land and limit the opportunity loss of the owner." (Emphases and 
underscoring supplied)


To excuse itself from the payment of interest, petitioner insists that 
there was no delay in the payment of the value of the expropriated 
properties because of its initial deposit with the RTC. We do not agree.

It cannot be overemphasized that the initial payment made by petitioner 
only represents the provisional value of the subject properties which 
"serves the double-purpose of (a) pre-payment if the property is fully 
expropriated, and (b) indemnity for damages if the proceedings are 
dismissed.
[39]
 It does not, in
 anyway, constitute the full and fair equivalent of the expropriated 
properties for it is the court which can judicially determine the same. 
Here, it is crystal clear that when the RTC adjudged the amount of just 
compensation, petitioner has already taken the condemned properties and 
respondents have already been deprived of the income that their 
properties would have made. There was already a delay in fully 
satisfying the payment of the just compensation. "Without prompt 
payment, compensation cannot be considered 'just' inasmuch as the 
property owner is made to suffer the consequences of being immediately 
deprived of his land while being made to wait for a decade or more 
before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss."
[40]

 Accordingly, the difference between the final amount to be adjudged by 
the RTC and the initial payment made by petitioner should earn interest.

Petitioner anchors its argument on the case of 
Republic v. Soriano
[41]
where the Court deleted the RTC's imposition of interest at 12% per annum for being unjustified. A plain reading of 
Soriano

 will readily show that it is not on all fours with the present dispute.
 The Court explicitly stated therein that the Republic "did not delay in
 its payment of just compensation as it had deposited the pertinent 
amount 
in full
 due to respondent on January 24, 2011 or four 
months before the taking thereof x x x." The Republic deposited the 
amount of P420,000.00 as initial payment and took possession of the 
property. Subsequently, the RTC pegged the just compensation at 
P2,100.00 per sq. m. or in the total amount of P420,000.00 for the 
200-sq. m. expropriated property. There being no unpaid balance of the 
just compensation, the Court ruled that the RTC's award of legal 
interest at 12% per annum is unwarranted. Undoubtedly, petitioner's 
reliance on 
Soriano
 is misplaced.

In ascertaining the proper legal interest to be imposed, we are guided by the Court's declaration in 
Republic v. Spouses Silvestre
:
[42]


[T]he delay in the payment of just compensation is a 
forbearance of money and, as such, is necessarily entitled to earn 
interest.
 Thus, the difference in the amount between the final 
amount as adjudged by the Court, which in this case is P15,225,000.00, 
and the initial payment made by the government, in the amount of 
P3,654,000.00 â which is part and parcel of the just compensation due to
 the property owner â should earn legal interest as a forbearance of 
money. Moreover, with respect to the amount of interest on this 
difference between the initial payment and the final amount of just 
compensation, as adjudged by the Court, we have upheld, in recent 
pronouncements, the imposition of 
12% interest rate from the time of taking, when the property owner was deprived of the property, until July 1, 2013
,
 when the legal interest on loans and forbearance of money was reduced 
from 12% to 6% per annum by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Circular No. 
799. Accordingly, 
from July 1, 2013 onwards, the legal interest on the difference between the final amount and initial payment is 6% per annum
. (Underscoring supplied)


Petitioner instituted the complaint for expropriation on October 19, 
2012 and was issued the writ of possession on February 8, 2013. The just
 compensation shall be appraised as of October 19, 2012 as it preceded 
the actual taking of the properties. The legal interest at 12% per annum
 on the difference between the final amount to be adjudged by the RTC 
and the initial payment made shall accrue from February 8, 2013 until 
June 30, 2013. From July 1, 2013 until the finality of the RTC Decision,
 the difference between the initial payment and the final amount to be 
adjudged by the RTC shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum. 
Thereafter, the total amount of just compensation shall earn legal 
interest of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full 
payment thereof.
[43]


WHEREFORE,
 in view of the foregoing reasons, the Court 
DISMISSES
 the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 of the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and 
AFFIRMS

 the Decision dated June 13, 2018 and the Resolution dated January 10, 
2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 108050. From the date of 
taking of the property on February 8, 2013 until June 30, 2013, the 
unpaid balance of the just compensation to be determined by the trial 
court shall earn interest at 12 % 
per annum
. From July 1, 2013 until the finality of the Decision fixing the just compensation, the legal interest shall be 6% 
per annum
. The total amount due shall earn a straight 6% 
per annum
 interest from the finality of the Decision fixing the just compensation until full payment.

.
 â In order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, the 
court may consider, among other well-established factors, the following
