DELOS SANTOS, J.:


Â It is not the injury which is compensated, but rather it is the 
incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning 
capacity.
[1]
 

This is to resolve the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[2]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of petitioner Raul D. Bitco (Bitco) seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision
[3]
 dated November 29, 2017 and the Resolution
[4]
dated
 May 3, 2018, both of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 
151891.


The factual antecedents are as follows:

Bitco was hired as Ordinary Seaman by respondent Crossworld Marine 
Services, Inc. (Crossworld) for and in behalf of its foreign principal 
Kapal (Cyprus) Ltd. after having passed his Pre-Employment Medical 
Examination and certified fit to work. The employment contract 
stipulated an eight-month duration plus one month upon mutual consent of
 both parties for a basic monthly salary of US$406.39 plus other 
benefits. Complainant left the Philippines on November 6, 2014 to board 
his vessel "M/V Eurocargo Bari." Sometime in February 2015, while on 
duty, Bitco suddenly felt a snap at his lower back while lifting 
supplies during provisions in Italy that resulted in acute moderate 
pain. He ignored the pain and continued with his work.
[5]
 

On June 25, 2015, after performing another heavy work, Bitco's lower 
back pain recurred. He was then brought to a medical facility in 
Valencia, Spain for check-up. Bitco was diagnosed to be suffering from 
Post Effort Acute Lumbociatalgia. He was given medication and was 
advised to rest for three days. Due to persistent pain, however, Bitco 
was declared unfit for sea duties and was ordered for repatriation to 
seek further evaluation and management in the Philippines.
[6]
 

Upon arrival in the Philippines on July 22, 2015, Bitco immediately 
reported to Crossworld for post-employment medical examination. He was 
referred to Ship-to-Shore Medical Assist in Makati City for medical 
treatment. Thereafter, Bitco was referred to St. Luke's Medical Center, 
Global City, Taguig City (St. Luke's Medical Center) for further 
treatment. He underwent eight sessions of physical therapy.
[7]


However, as no significant improvement was noted, Bitco underwent 
epidural steroid injection on September 12, 2015 and given another set 
of physiotherapy. On October 16, 2015, he underwent Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging Examination of the Lumbosacral Spine at St. Luke's Medical 
Center. Results revealed the following: Straightened Lumbar Curvature 
maybe due to muscle spasm; Dessicated disks and Spondylosis at L4-L5 and
 L5-S1 resulting in severe bilateral neural canal narrowing and mild 
spinal canal narrowing at L4-L5 and mild narrowing of the spinal and 
both neural canals at L5-S1; small center annular tear L5-S1; mild 
levoscoliosis; incidental note of small cyst in the right kidney.
[8]
 

Despite physical therapy, Bitco noted veiy minimal improvement. Bitco 
was treated by the company-designated physician until December 15, 2015.
 Thereafter, the company-designated physician assessed Bitco with a 
partial disability Grade 8 pursuant to the Philippine Overseas 
Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC).
[9]
 

On January 26, 2016, as Bitco was still experiencing severe pains in his
 lower back and numbness on his left leg, he consulted Dr. Renato P. 
Runas (Dr. Runas), an Orthopedic Surgeon. Said doctor issued a Medical 
Report stating that Bitco is unfit for duty as a seafarer in whatever 
capacity with a total permanent disability since he can no longer 
perform his work which he is previously engaged. Dr. Runas further noted
 that Bitco remains incapacitated and is "saddled with the impediment of
 being unable to carry and lift heavy objects due to back stiffness 
which make it difficult for him to bend, pick-up and carry objects from 
the floor. Prolonged [sitting] and standing worsen the discomfort."
[10]


As parties could not agree and settle the disability benefits claimed by Bitco, this case was filed.
[11]


In their defense, respondents argued that Bitco could not claim total 
and permanent disability because he did not present a second doctor's 
opinion and referral to a third doctor. He is only entitled to receive 
partial disability benefits because that was what was assessed by the 
company-designated physician (Grade 8 disability). Moreover, they 
reminded the Labor Arbiter (LA) that the POEA-SEC states that disability
 compensation shall be complied with in accordance with the schedule of 
benefits. Likewise, the claim under the Collective Bargaining Agreement 
should also fail because the ailment did not result from an accident.
[12]


In response, Bitco insisted that the referral to a third doctor is 
merely permissive, not mandatory. While non-referral to a third doctor 
will render the doctor's diagnosis controlling, it is not the absolute 
and automatic consequence in all cases. Courts and tribunals remain 
duty-bound to evaluate and examine the contents of the medical 
evaluations submitted in evidence. In Bitco's case, there was no 
definite declaration within the 120/240-day period on whether or not he 
can still resume his post as an Ordinary Seaman. Remarkably, the final 
medical report stated that his trunk motion remained limited despite 
extensive treatment, thus, indicating that despite treatment, he remains
 incapacitated to perform his duties.
[13]


Labor Arbiter's Ruling


On January 23, 2017, LA Irene Castro-De Quiroz rendered a Decision
[14]

 finding merit in the complaint for total and permanent disability. The 
LA found that Bitco's disability became total and permanent because he 
failed to return to work after 120 days or even 240 days.

Moreover, the LA found that the company-designated physician's 
disability grading of 8 doubtful, given that there was no guarantee that
 physical therapy and/or surgery can restore Bitco's capability to 
assume sea duties. Thus, while Bitco's own physician assessed him to be 
permanently incapacitated, the non-referral to a third doctor did not 
negate Bitco's cause of action. The dispositive portion of the Decision 
reads as follows:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Labor Arbitration 
Branch finds merit in the complaint for total and permanent disability.

The respondent companies Crossworld Marine Services Inc. and Kapal 
(Cyprus), are held jointly and severally liable to pay the complainant 
his disability benefit of USD 60,000.00 and 10% Attorney's fees.
[15]


Aggrieved by the LA's Decision, respondents elevated the case to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for review. 
NLRC Ruling


On May 9, 2017, the NLRC issued a Decision
[16]
 dismissing respondents' appeal and affirming 
in toto

 the Decision of the LA. 
The NLRC adopted the finding of the LA that Bitco was already declared 
partially and permanently disabled within the 120-day or 240-day period,
 but he remained incapacitated to perform his usual sea duties after the
 lapse of said period.
[17]


The NLRC also ruled that the lack of opinion by a third doctor did not 
defeat Bitco's cause of action. It noted the permissiveness of Section 
20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC, which should be invoked for the protection and
 benefit of the seafarer. The provision used the phrase "may be agreed 
jointly" when pertaining to the referral to a third doctor. Hence, the 
said referral is not mandatory.
[18]
 

The respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration.

On May 31, 2017, the NLRC issued a Resolution
[19]
 denying respondents' Motion for Reconsideration.

Thus, respondents elevated the matter to the CA via a Petition for 
Certiorari

 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.

In their petition, respondents argued that Bitco had no cause of action 
at the time the complaint was filed. There was no evidence that he was 
incapacitated for work except for the opinion of the company-designated 
physician. In fact, the company-designated physician gave him a Grade 8 
partial disability rating. As regards the allegations that the 240-day 
period had already lapsed, respondents argue that the number of days 
alone does not determine the entitlement to disability benefits. Rather,
 it is the disability ratings that determine the basis for such 
entitlement.
[20]
 They also 
claimed that the NLRC gravely erred in stating that the referral to a 
third doctor is not mandatory and absent the third doctor's opinion, a 
complaint shall be dismissed for lack of cause of action.
[21]

 As regards the award of attorney's fees, they asserted that Bitco is 
not entitled to the same since the respondents acted within their rights
 when they denied his demands for total and permanent disability 
benefits.
[22]
 Moreover, they 
also argued that Bitco is not entitled to moral damages, as he failed to
 allege and prove any of the situations provided in the said provision.
[23]
 

On the other hand, Bitco averred that the grounds raised by respondents 
which question the labor tribunal's ascribing of liability upon them is 
not a proper subject of a 
certiorari
 petition under Rule 65 of 
the Rules of Court. Only errors of jurisdiction, not errors of judgment,
 may be dealt with in a petition for 
certiorari
.
[24]

 Bitco also reiterated that the Medical Report dated December 17, 2015 
clearly failed to make a definite declaration from the 
company-designated physician within the period of 120 or 240 days that 
he can still resume his customary duties as an Ordinary Seaman.
[25]

 Anent attorney's fees, Bitco argued that the award is proper because he
 was constrained to secure the services of a counsel to pursue his 
claims against the respondents.
[26]

 Thus, there was no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction when the NLRC affirmed the award of attorney's 
fees.
[27]


CA Ruling


In a Decision
[28]
 dated November 29, 2017, the CA granted the petition, the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE, the instant petition for 
certiorari
 is GRANTED. The Decision dated May 9, 2017 and Resolution dated May 31, 2017 of the NLRC are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

SO ORDERED.
[29]


The CA reiterated that it is a settled rule that referral to a third 
doctor is a mandatory procedure. The NLRC is incorrect in automatically 
concluding that the opinion of the third doctor is no longer binding 
because the same would have been issued after the lapse of the 240-day 
period. The rule is that the findings of the company-designated 
physician shall prevail in cases where the seafarer did not observe the 
third doctor referral provision in the POEA-SEC.
[30]


The CA ruled that the findings of the company-designated physician have 
sufficient basis in light of the fact that Bitco has been under her 
treatment and management for several months. The company-designated 
physician was likely to have more credible assessment of Bitco's medical
 condition since she was able to closely monitor his ailment ever since 
his repatriation.
[31]


On December 22, 2017, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration assailing the November 29, 2017 Decision of the CA.

On May 3, 2018, the CA denied, in a Resolution,
[32]
 the Motion for Reconsideration. Hence, this Petition raising the following errors:


I.

THE HONORABLE [CA] GRAVELY ERRED IN ANNULLING AND SETTING ASIDE THE 
DECISION OF THE NLRC AWARDING PERMANENT AND TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFITS TO
 HEREIN PETITIONER.


II.

THE HONORABLE [CA] ERRED IN NOT AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES TO HEREIN PETITIONER.
[33]


The Court's Ruling


The fundamental issue that the Court must resolve is whether Bitco is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.


At the outset, it must be emphasized that this Court is not a trier of facts and as general rule, only questions of law raised 
via
 a Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are reviewable by this Court.
[34]
The function of the Court in petitions for review on 
certiorari
 is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts.
[35]
 
Factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, including 
labor tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are 
specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction 
especially when these are supported by substantial evidence.
[36]

 The rule, however, is not ironclad and a departure therefrom may be 
warranted where the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to the 
findings and conclusions of the trial court or quasi-judicial agency, as
 in this case.
[37]
 Thus, the 
Court is constrained to review and resolve the factual issue in order to
 settle the controversy.

The present case before us involves the claim for permanent and total 
disability benefits of a seafarer, Bitco.

In his Petition, Bitco argues that he is entitled to permanent and total
 disability benefits because it is undeniable that his injury remained 
unresolved. The recommended treatment and therapy accorded to Bitco by 
respondents' medical team, did not restore his pre-injury capacity. 
Bitco's tasks as Ordinary Seaman were predominantly manual in nature 
involving a lot of lifting and carrying heavy objects. Thus, while the 
company- designated physician assessed Bitco of a partial disability of 
Grade 8, the latter has remained incapacitated to work for more than 240
 days owing to the injury he sustained on board respondents' vessel "M/V
 Eurocargo Bari." As such, he is already considered to be permanently 
and totally disabled. Bitco avers that it is the inability of a seafarer
 to work within the period prescribed by law that determines his 
entitlement to permanent total disability compensation and not merely on
 the disability gradings provided under the POEA-SEC. Moreover, Bitco 
also maintains that there was no definite declaration from the 
company-designated physician with the period of 120 or 240 days whether 
he can still resume his customary duties as Ordinary Seaman. In the 
absence of such declaration, Bitco is still deemed to be permanently and
 totally disabled. Lastly, since Bitco was constrained to secure the 
services of a counsel to pursue his claims, he is also entitled to 
attorney's fees. 
In their Comment,
[38]
 
respondents posit that the lone Medical Report presented by Bitco can be
 hardly considered to be sufficient under the provisions of the 
POEA-SEC. First, there was no declaration of how work- related illness 
applies, as it only provides for generic allegations; second, there was 
no proper degree of disability assessment; third, it was a product of a 
single consultation; and fourth, it was obviously issued by mere 
accommodation. Therefore, it cannot be gainsaid that no physician 
credibly declared Bitco as permanently and totally disabled, in fact the
 assessment was not a work-related condition. Respondents also argue 
that the provisions under the POEA-SEC and not the number of days of 
disability determine whether or not Bitco is permanently and totally 
disabled.

The Petition is meritorious.


Without a valid, final, and definitive

assessment, the seafarer's disability 
becomes permanent and total.


The entitlement of an overseas seafarer to disability benefits is 
governed by law, the employment contract, and the medical findings.
[39]

 By law, the seafarer's disability benefits claim is governed by 
Articles 197 to 199 (formerly Articles 191-193), under Chapter VI 
(Disability Benefits), Book IV of the Labor Code, in relation to Rule X 
of the Rules and Regulations Implementing Book IV of the Labor Code.
[40]

 By contract, it is governed by the employment contract which the 
seafarer and his employer/local manning agency executes prior to 
employment, and the applicable POEA-SEC that is deemed incorporated in 
the employment contract. Lastly, the medical findings of the 
company-designated physician, the seafarer's personal physician, and 
those of the mutually-agreed third physician, pursuant to the POEA-SEC, 
govern.
[41]
 Since Bitco was 
employed in 2014, the 2010 POEA-SEC governs the procedure for 
compensation and benefits for a work-related injury or illness suffered 
by a seafarer on board sea-going vessels during the term of his 
contract.

Pursuant to Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, when a seafarer suffers a
 work-related injury or illness in the course of employment, the 
company-designated physician is obligated to arrive at a definite 
assessment of the former's fitness or degree of disability within a 
period of 120 days from repatriation.
[42]

 During the said period, the seafarer shall be deemed on temporary total
 disability and shall receive his basic wage until he is declared fit to
 work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be 
permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined 
under the POEA-SEC and by applicable Philippine laws. However, if the 
120-day period is exceeded and no definitive declaration is made because
 the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary 
total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, 
subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a
 permanent partial or total disability already exists.
[43]

 But before the company-designated physician may avail of the allowable 
240-day extended treatment period, he must perform some significant act 
to justify the extension of the original 120-day period.
[44]
 Otherwise, 
the law grants the seafarer the relief of permanent total disability benefits due to such nonÃÂ­compliance.
[45]
 

In 
Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue
,
[46]

 the Court summarized the rules regarding the company-designated 
physician's duty to issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's 
disability grading as follows:


The company-designated physician must issue a final 
medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period 
of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him;


If the company-designated physician fails to give his 
assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable 
reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total;


If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (
e.g.
,
 seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was 
uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be 
extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the 
company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the 
period; and


If the company-designated physician still fails to give his 
assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's 
disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.
[47]


In the case at bar, Bitco was medically repatriated and he arrived in 
the Philippines on July 22, 2015. He immediately reported to his manning
 agency for post-employment medical examination and was referred at 
Ship-to-Shore Medical Assist in Makati City for medical treatment. 
Thereafter, Bitco was referred to St. Luke's Medical Center for further 
treatment wherein he underwent eight sessions of physical therapy. On 
December 17, 2015 or after 150 days, the company-designated physician 
assessed Bitco with a partial disability Grade 8 pursuant to the 
POEA-SEC, but there was no definite declaration whether Bitco can still 
return to his customary duties as an Ordinary Seaman.

A final, conclusive, and definite medical assessment must clearly state 
whether the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or 
whether such illness is work-related, and without any further condition 
or treatment. It should no longer require any further action on the part
 of the company-designated physician and it is issued by the 
company-designated physician after he or she has exhausted all possible 
treatment options within the periods allowed by law.
[48]


Without a valid, final, and definitive assessment from the 
company-designated physician, respondent's temporary and total 
disability, by operation of law, became permanent and total.
[49]


Mandatory third-physician rule,
exception.


Petitioner asserts that the CA erred in ruling that referral to a third doctor is mandatory procedure.

Section 20 of the POEA-SEC states:


A. Compensation and Benefits for Injury or Illness

The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-

related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows:


x x x x


3. In addition to the above obligation of the employer to provide 
medical attention, the seafarer shall also receive sickness allowance 
from his employer in an amount equivalent to his basic wage computed 
from the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the 
degree of disability has been assessed by the company-designated 
physician. The period within which the seafarer shall be entitled to his
 sickness allowance shall not exceed 120 days. Payment of the sickness 
allowance shall be made on a regular basis, but not less than once a 
month.

The seafarer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the cost of medicines
 prescribed by the company-designated physician. In case treatment of 
the seafarer is on an out-patient basis as determined by the 
company-designated physician, the company shall approve the appropriate 
mode of transportation and accommodation. 
The reasonable cost of actual 
traveling expenses and/or accommodation shall be paid subject to 
liquidation and submission of official receipts and/or proof of 
expenses.

For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment
 medical examination by a company-designated physician within three 
working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated 
to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same 
period is deemed as compliance. In the course of the treatment, the 
seafarer shall also report regularly to the company-designated physician
 specifically on the dates as prescribed by the company-designated 
physician and agreed to by the seafarer. Failure of the seafarer to 
comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his 
forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.
Â 
If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a
 third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the 
seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both
 parties.
 (Emphasis supplied)


The assessment referred to in this provision is the declaration of 
fitness to work or the degree of disability. It presupposes that the 
company-designated physician came up with a valid, final, and definite 
assessment on the seafarer's fitness to work before the 120-day or 
240-day period expires.
[50]
 
The company can insist on its disability rating even against a contrary 
opinion by another doctor, unless the seafarer signifies his intent to 
submit the dispute assessment to a third physician.
[51]

 The duty to secure the opinion of a third doctor belongs to the 
employee asking for disability benefits. He must actively or expressly 
request for it.
[52]


The Court, in the recent cases of 
Murillo v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.
,
[53]
 and 
Dionio v. Trans-Global Maritime Agency, Inc.
,
[54]

 reiterated the settled rule that referral to a third doctor is 
mandatory, and the seafarer's failure to abide thereby is a breach of 
the POEA-SEC which makes the assessment of the company-designated 
physician final and binding. 
However, our jurisprudence is replete with cases which pronounce that 
before a seafarer should be compelled to initiate referral to a third 
doctor, there must first be a final and categorical assessment made by 
the company designated-physician as to the seafarer's disability within 
the 120/240-day period. Otherwise, the seafarer shall be considered 
disabled by operation of law.
[55]
 

In 
Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar
,
[56]

 the Court ruled that a seafarer's compliance with the third-doctor rule
 presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with an 
assessment as to his fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration 
of the 120-day or 240-day periods. 

In the case at bar, the company-designated physician issued an 
assessment on December 17, 2015 that the petitioner is with a partial 
disability Grade 8, but he did not state whether the petitioner is fit 
to work or not. Consequently, the absence of a final assessment by the 
company-designated physician makes the rule on third-doctor-referral 
inapplicable in the instant case. The failure of the company-designated 
physician to issue a final assessment and disability grading within the 
240-day period made the petitioner's disability total and permanent even
 without evaluation by a third doctor. Evidently, there is no need for 
the petitioner to initiate the referral to a third doctor for him to be 
entitled to permanent disability benefits.
[57]


Incapacity to work is compensated,
not the injury per se.


In the said final Medical Report dated December 17, 2015, it was 
declared that the patient's medical condition is work-related and that 
Bitco's trunk motion remains to be limited despite extensive treatment 
accorded to him. An analysis of the final Medical Report alongside with 
the Medical Report in November 2015 also reveals that Bitco was 
forewarned that "prognosis with his two-level disc herniation/extrusion 
is guarded when it comes to returning to heavy labor."
[58]

 As correctly ruled by the NLRC, as an Ordinary Seaman, Bitco cannot 
choose his tasks which, more often than not, includes heavy lifting. To 
limit his tasks only means he can no longer function in the same manner 
for which he was trained and accustomed to perform. 
Moreover, the Medical Evaluation Report dated January 26, 2016 by 
Bitco's own physician, Dr. Runas, also revealed that Bitco has not 
actually recovered from his condition since his repatriation on July 22,
 2015. 
With practically the same medical observations of the company- 
designated physician and Bitco's own doctor, it is undeniable that 
Bitco's injury persists and remained unresolved. Even if the two 
physicians gave different disability grading, it is a fact that Bitco 
remained to be incapacitated to work and there is no guarantee that he 
can return to his normal sea duties. Bitco's disability, thus, became 
total and permanent as he failed to return to work after 120 and even 
240 days after his repatriation. 
Permanent disability transpires when the inability to work continues 
beyond 120 days, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any 
part of his body. On the other hand, total disability means the 
incapacity of an employee to earn wages in the same or similar kind of 
work that he was trained for, or is accustomed to perform, or in any 
kind of work that a person of his mentality and attainments can do. It 
does not mean absolute helplessness.
[59]


Accordingly, permanent total disability means the inability to do 
substantially all material acts necessary to the prosecution of a 
gainful occupation without serious discomfort or pain and without 
material injury or danger to life. In disability compensation, it is not
 the injury 
per se
 which is compensated, but the incapacity to work.
[60]


Otherwise stated, "it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather
 it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's 
earning capacity."
[61]
 Total 
disability refers to an employee's inability to perform his or her usual
 work. It does not require total paralysis or complete helplessness.
[62]

 Permanent disability, on the other hand, is a worker's inability to 
perform his or her job for more than 120 days, or 240 days if the 
seafarer required further medical attention justifying the extension of 
the temporary total disability period, regardless of whether or not he 
loses the use of any part of his body.
[63]


Applying previous pronouncements of the Court, under the circumstances 
of this case, Bitco is entitled to permanent and total disability 
benefits. 


Claim for Attorney's Fees.
 

Anent Bitco's claim for attorney's fees, Article 2208 of the New Civil 
Code provides that attorney's fees can be recovered in actions for the 
recovery of wages of laborers and actions for indemnity under the 
employer's liability laws. Attorney's fees is also recoverable when the 
respondent's act or omission has compelled the complainant to incur 
expenses to protect his interest.
[64]
 Such conditions being present in the case at bar, we find that an award of attorney's fees is warranted in favor of Bitco.


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the instant Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 is hereby 
GRANTED
.
 The Decision dated November 29, 2017 and the Resolution dated May 3, 
2018, both of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 151891 are 
REVERSED
