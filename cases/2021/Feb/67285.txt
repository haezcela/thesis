SUSAN M. BANCE,[1] ARLENE C. DIMAIWAT, JEAN O. VELASCO, NANCY M. AGUIRRE, AND HAZEL A. LOBETANIA, PETITIONERS, VS. UNIVERSITY OF ST. ANTHONY AND SANTIAGO ORTEGA, JR., RESPONDENTS.

HERNANDO, J.:


Challenged in this Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[2]
 are the April 17, 2012 Decision
[3]
 and June 27, 2012 Resolution
[4]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 115111, which affirmed with modification the September 30, 2009 Decision
[5]
 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC Case No. 12-003998-08. 

The NLRC Decision reversed and set aside the October 1, 2008 Decision
[6]

 of the Labor Arbiter (LA), and held that the petitioner-employees were 
rightfully dismissed from employment in respondent University of St. 
Anthony (University). 


The Factual Antecedents:
 

Petitioners Susan M. Bance (Bance), Arlene C. Dimaiwat (Dimaiwat), Jean 
O. Velasco (Velasco), Nancy M. Aguirre (Aguirre), and Hazel A. Lobetania
 (Lobetania; collectively, petitioners) filed complaints for illegal 
dismissal with money claims against respondents University and Atty. 
Santiago D. Ortega, Jr. (Atty. Ortega; collectively, respondents). 

The University is an educational institution duly organized and existing
 under Philippine laws.
[7]
 Atty. Ortega is the President and the Chairman of the University's Board of Trustees.
[8]
 Mrs. Victoria SD. Ortega (Mrs. Ortega) was originally impleaded in the case but was subsequently dropped as a party respondent.
[9]
 She is the University's Vice-President for Finance.

[12]
 


Facts relative to Lobetania:


In June 2006, several irregular and anomalous transactions were noted in the University's Accounting Office.
[13]
 Consequently, in January 2007, Atty. Ortega hired an external auditor to conduct an investigation.
[14]

 The audit report dated March 13, 2007 revealed a cash shortage of 
PI,239,856.25, which represents the net collection of book remittances.
[15]
 The cash should have been kept inside the cash vault under the custody of Lobetania but it was missing.
[16]
As a result, Lobetania was asked to go on a leave of absence.
[17]

 During her conference with Atty. Ortega, Lobetania admitted that she 
failed to deposit the amount in the University's bank account.
[18]
 Upon demand to return the amount,
[19]

 Lobetania paid it in installments out of her personal funds as 
evidenced by official receipts issued by the University under her name.
[20]

 In a subsequent audit report dated May 15, 2007, additional anomalous 
transactions in the prior years surfaced where the tellers accommodated 
the encashment of checks not in the name of the University.
[21]
 
Lobetania went on leave for the duration of the audit. Eventually, she 
tendered her resignation on July 27, 2007 (to take effect on August 1, 
2007), and was approved by Atty. Ortega on August 9, 2007.
[22]


Subsequently, on February 22, 2008, the University filed criminal cases for Estafa against Lobetania.
[23]

 On March 25, 2008, the prosecutor found probable cause to charge her 
with Qualified Theft and filed the corresponding Information before the 
Regional Trial Court of Iriga City.
[24]




Facts relative to Bance, 
Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre: 
At around the same period, Bance, Dimaiwat, and Aguirre were found to 
have taken advantage of their positions in the Accounting Office by 
enrolling their children and relatives, including Velasco's, under the 
University's group enrollment incentive program
[25]
 despite knowing that they were unqualified.
[26]
Upon
 discovery of the fraudulent scheme in November 2007, Atty. Ortega 
immediately ordered an investigation and called a conference with the 
alleged perpetrators.
[27]
 

During the December 2007 conference, petitioners (excluding Lobetania) 
were apprised of the infractions they committed. During the conference, 
they admitted that their children and relatives indeed benefitted from 
the unauthorized discounts.
[28]
 Atty. Ortega thus verbally informed them that their employment will be terminated.
[29]

 On December 22, 2007, Atty. Ortega issued Office Memo No. 007-026, 
informing them that their employment will be terminated effective 
January 1, 2008 on grounds of dishonesty amounting to malversation of 
school funds.
[30]
 The office 
memo was allegedly not preceded by any written notice to petitioners 
except for the two conferences and a verbal announcement during the 
second conference.
[31]
 
Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre opted to resign. They tendered their 
resignation on December 22, 2007 (taking effect on January 2, 2008), and
 these were approved by Atty. Ortega on December 26, 2007.
[32]
 Bance did not tender her resignation.
[33]


Subsequently, the University filed several criminal cases for Estafa against Bance, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre.
[34]
 These are pending before the Municipal Trial Court in Iriga City.
[35]
 
On April 1, 2008, Bance, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre filed their 
respective complaints for illegal dismissal with money claims against 
the respondents.
[36]
 Lobetania filed hers on April 22, 2008.
[37]

 They subsequently amended their complaints to include claims for unpaid
 salaries and 13th month pay, and to implead Mrs. Ortega as respondent 
in Lobetania's complaint.
[38]
 
Proceedings ensued. Respondents opted to file two separate position 
papers-one position paper on Lobetania's case and another on Bance, 
Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre's case.
[39]
 They, however, belatedly filed their position paper on Bance, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre's case before the LA.
[40]
 

In their Joint Position Paper,
[41]
 petitioners contended that their dismissal was illegal for lack of just or authorized causes
[42]
 and non-observance of the requirements of procedural due process.
[43]

 Lobetania, for her part, stated that there was no missing money as the 
P1,239,856.25 she allegedly pilfered was actually used by Mrs. Ortega to
 pay off loans 
[44]
 She was 
only forced to pay the amount from her personal funds, as evidenced by 
official receipts issued by the University under her name, because of 
the threats issued by Atty. Ortega.
[45]
 Petitioners prayed for reinstatement, and payment of money claims, moral, nominal, and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
[46]
 

On the other hand, in their two separate Position Papers,
[47]
 respondents contended that petitioners' (except Bance) resignation rendered the complaints for illegal dismissal without basis.
[48]
 Respondents added that, in any event, petitioners' (including Bance) dismissals were for a just cause (
i.e.
,
 willful breach of trust and fraud) based on the acts that they 
committed during their employment as shown by the result of the 
investigation and audits.
[49]
Respondents prayed for the dismissal of the complaints and for the payment of moral and exemplary damages to the University.
[50]


Ruling of the Labor Arbiter:
 

On October 1, 2008, the LA rendered a Decision finding petitioners to have been illegally dismissed
[51]

 and ordering the respondents to reinstate them to their previous or 
equivalent positions without loss of seniority rights, and to pay them 
(jointly and severally) backwages, unpaid salaries, 13
th
 month pay, holiday pay, damages, and attorney's fees.
[52]
 The LA also ordered respondents to reimburse Lobetania the amount of P1,239,856.25.
[53]


The LA found that the University, as employer, failed to discharge the 
burden of showing by substantial evidence that there was just or 
authorized cause in the dismissal of Bance, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and 
Aguirre.
[54]
 In failing to file a position paper on time, respondents were deemed to have waived presenting evidence in their favor.
[55]

 As for Lobetania's case, the LA found that the missing funds were 
actually used by Mrs. Ortega to pay off her personal obligations.
[56]
 Moreover, Lobetania was even forced to repay that amount to the University from her personal funds.
[57]
 The LA also ruled that respondents failed to afford petitioners procedural due process in effecting their dismissal.
[58]


The dispositive portion of the LA Decision reads:


WHEREFORE,
 in view of the foregoing, judgment is 
hereby rendered finding respondents UNIVERSITY OF SAINT ANTHONY/ATTY. 
SANTIAGO D. ORTEGA, JR., guilty of illegal dismissal and liable for 
money claims of complainants SUSAN M. BANCE, ARLENE C. DIMAIWAT, JEAN O.
 VELASCO, and NANCY M. AGUIRRE.

Likewise, respondents UNIVERSITY OF SAINT ANTHONY/ATTY. SANTIAGO D. 
ORTEGA, JR./MRS. VICTORIA SD. ORTEGA are found guilty of illegal 
dismissal and liable for money claims of complainant HAZEL LOBETANIA.
 x x x x

SO ORDERED.
[59]


Aggrieved, respondents appealed the LA Decision to the NLRC.


Ruling of the National Labor 
Relations Commission:


In its September 30, 2009 Decision, the NLRC reversed and set aside the 
LA Decision. It ruled that petitioners were not illegally dismissed.
[60]
 It, however, ordered the University to pay Bance indemnity for failure to observe procedural due process; pay Lobetania her 13
th
 month pay; and, pay all petitioners their holiday pay for three (3) years.
[61]
 The Decision also dropped Mrs. Ortega as respondent.
[62]


The NLRC ruled that the complaints for illegal dismissal have no basis 
as petitioners, except for Bance, had voluntarily resigned before the 
effectivity of the termination of their employment.
[63]

 In other words, they opted for a voluntary exit instead of being fired.
 As for Bance, the criminal charges for Estafa filed by the University 
against her provided ample basis for her dismissal on grounds of serious
 misconduct and loss of trust and confidence.
[64]
However,
 the NLRC found that procedural due process was not observed in the 
termination of Bance's employment, thus, it awarded nominal damages in 
the amount of P5,000.00.
[65]


On the matter of the payment of P1,239,856.25 as reimbursement to 
Lobetania, the NLRC declared that the claim is not covered by any labor 
law, labor standard, or a provision of a collective bargaining agreement
[66]
 hence it dismissed the claim with advice that the parties may litigate in a different forum.
[67]


The dispositive portion of the NLRC Decision reads:


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the appeal filed by 
respondents is GRANTED. The appealed Decision of Labor Arbiter Jesus 
Orlando M. Quinones dated October 1, 2008 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and
 a NEW ONE [is] rendered declaring complainants not to have been 
illegally dismissed by respondents.

1. However, respondent USANT is hereby ordered:

a. To pay complainant Susan Bance the sum of P5,000.00 as indemnity for 
failure to observe procedural due process as discussed above
b. To pay all complainants their holiday pay for 3 years
c. To pay complainant Lobetania her 13
th
 month pay for 2007 in the sum of P2,334.00 as computed in this Decision; and

2. Individual respondent Victoria SD. Ortega is hereby dropped as party respondent


SO ORDERED.
[68]


Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but this was subsequently denied in a Resolution dated April 8, 2010.
[69]


Hence, they filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
 before the CA.
[70]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:


On April 17, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision affirming the ruling of 
the NLRC with modification in that it deleted the award of nominal 
damages in favor of Bance.
[71]


It found that the requirement of substantive due process was satisfied with respect to Lobetania and Bance's dismissal,
[72]
 
i.e.
,
 loss of trust and confidence in view of their participation in the 
anomalous handling of the University's finances. Lobetania failed to 
remit collections to the University's bank account while Bance enrolled 
unqualified candidates into the University's group enrollment incentive 
program.
[73]
 Further, the CA 
ruled that the requirement of procedural due process was aptly observed 
in Bance's dismissal, hence, she is not entitled to nominal damages.
[74]
 As for Lobetania, the requirement of procedural due process is irrelevant in view of her voluntary resignation.
[75]


With respect to Velasco, Aguirre, and Dimaiwat, there was just cause for their dismissal, 
i.e.
,
 dishonesty, when they participated in the anomalous scheme in the 
University's accounting department by making their children and 
relatives beneficiaries of the group enrollment incentive program.
[76]


The CA agreed with the NLRC's disposition on the matter of the payment 
of P1,239,856.25 as reimbursement to Lobetania. It stated that the issue
 did not arise from an employer-employee relationship but was a personal
 financial accommodation on the part of Lobetania.
[77]


The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:


WHEREFORE,
 foregoing considered, the Petition is hereby 
DISMISSED
. The September 30, 2009 Decision of the NLRC is 
AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION
 that the award of nominal damages in favor of Susan [Bance] is 
DELETED
.


SO ORDERED.
[78]


Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but this was subsequently denied in a Resolution dated June 27, 2012.
[79]


Steadfast, petitioners elevated the case to this Court praying for the reinstatement of the LA Decision.
[80]

 They maintain that there was no just cause in their dismissal from 
employment. They allege that Lobetania was dismissed because Atty. 
Ortega found out that she was more loyal to Mrs. Ortega than to him.
[81]
 There were no missing funds contrary to what the respondents alleged, hence, Lobetania's termination was unfounded.
[82]

 With respect to Bance, the allegation that she took undue advantage of 
the University's group enrollment incentive program was unsubstantiated.
[83]

 The same was true as to Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre â the allegation
 that they participated in the anomalous transaction involving the group
 enrollment incentive program was unsubstantiated.
[84]

 Petitioners also argue that the finding of probable cause in the 
criminal cases filed against them does not constitute just cause for 
their dismissal from employment.
[85]


Petitioners further allege that procedural due process was not observed.
 Respondents allegedly did not issue a written notice informing them of 
the charges.
[86]
 In relation to this, petitioners claim that an award of nominal damages is proper based on existing case law.
[87]


On the matter of reimbursement to Lobetania, petitioners contend that 
the financial accommodation extended by Lobetania to Mrs. Ortega arose 
from employer-employee relationship.
[88]


In their Comment,
[89]
 
respondents claim that petitioners, except Bance, voluntarily resigned, 
hence, their complaints for illegal dismissal had no basis.
[90]

 Bance's dismissal was for a just cause because the audit results showed
 that she committed anomalous transactions in the Accounting Department 
by extending group enrollment incentives and discounts to unqualified 
beneficiaries, including her children and relatives.
[91]

 She gravely abused her authority and committed fraudulent acts, 
resulting to loss of the trust and confidence reposed by respondents.
[92]

 In any case, notwithstanding their voluntary resignation, the other 
petitioners were dismissed for just cause, i.e., fraud and willful 
breach of trust and confidence.
[93]

 Respondents also point out the CA's pronouncement that procedural due 
process was observed in Bance's dismissal from employment.
[94]

 They likewise reiterate the CA's ruling that Lobetania's claim was 
entirely a personal transaction between Lobetania and Mrs. Ortega.
[95]


Issues


Whether petitioners' (except Bance) voluntary resignation render their complaints for illegal dismissal without basis.


Whether Bance was illegally dismissed.


Whether the labor tribunal has jurisdiction to resolve the issue of reimbursement to Lobetania.


Our Ruling


We affirm the Decision of the CA with modification on the award of 
nominal damages. After an exhaustive review of the records, We hold 
that: (1) the voluntary resignation of Lobetania, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and
 Aguirre rendered their complaints for illegal dismissal without any 
basis; (2) Bance's dismissal was valid, but procedural due process was 
not observed, entitling her to nominal damages; and, (3) the issue of 
reimbursement to Lobetania is already moot.

The Constitution affords protection to labor and promotes full 
employment.
[96]
 This policy is echoed in Article 3 of the Labor Code (as amended and renumbered).
[97]


Philippine labor laws are adopted with a view to give maximum aid and protection to labor.
[98]
 However, they are not to be applied in a manner that undermines a valid exercise of management prerogative.
[99]

 The Constitution and labor laws recognize the right of the employers to
 regulate all aspects of employment, and this right is limited only by 
those imposed by labor laws and principles of equity and substantial 
justice.
[100]
 
Telus International Philippines, Inc. v. De Guzman
[101]
 instructs:


Similarly, labor laws and the [Constitution] recognize the 
right of the employers to regulate, according to his/her own discretion 
and judgment, all aspects of employment, including hiring, work 
assignments, working methods, the time, place[,] and manner of work, 
work supervision, transfer of employees, lay-off of workers, and 
discipline, dismissal, and recall of employees. The only limitations to 
the exercise of this prerogative are those imposed by labor laws and the
 principles of equity and substantial justice. (Citations omitted)


Management prerogative includes the right to discipline employees, which
 necessarily includes dismissal of employees based on just and 
authorized causes.
[102]


For a dismissal from employment to be valid, both the substantial and 
procedural due process requirements must be satisfactorily complied 
with.
[103]
 Substantial due 
process pertains to the "employee's right not to be dismissed without 
just or authorized cause, as provided by law."
[104]

 Procedural due process pertains to the employer's compliance with the 
procedure in effecting a dismissal as provided in the Labor Code and 
implementing rules.
[105]
 The burden of proving that the dismissal was valid rests on the employer; failure to do so renders the dismissal illegal.
[106]


A dismissal based on a just cause implies that the employee has 
committed some violation against the employer, hence, it can be said 
that the employee initiated the dismissal process.
[107]
 The Labor Code provides for the instances when an employer may terminate an employment due to just cause:


Art. 297. 
[282]
 
Termination by Employer. â An employer may terminate an employment for 
any of the following causes:

(a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the 
lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his 
work;

(b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;

(c) Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him 
by his employer or duly authorized representative;

(d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person 
of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly 
authorized representatives; and

(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing.


To comply with the requirements of substantial due process, the cause of
 the dismissal must have basis under the law. Failure to observe 
substantial due process renders the dismissal illegal and entitles the 
employee to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other 
privileges, full backwages inclusive of allowances, and other benefits 
or their monetary equivalent.
[108]


On procedural due process, Article 292 (formerly Article 277) of the 
Labor Code provides for the maimer of termination of employment based on
 just cause. The case of 
King of Kings Transport, Inc. v. Mamac
[109]
standardized
 the requirements of procedural due process in termination of 
employment, applying Article 292 and its corresponding implementing 
rules. The case provides:


To clarify, the following should be considered in terminating the services of employees:

(1)
 The first written notice to be served oil the employees should 
contain the specific causes or grounds for termination against them
,
 and a directive that the employees are given the opportunity to submit 
their written explanation within a reasonable period. "Reasonable 
opportunity" under the Omnibus Rules means every kind of assistance that
 management must accord to the employees to enable them to prepare 
adequately for their defense. This should be construed as a period of at
 least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to give the 
employees an opportunity to study the accusation against them, consult a
 union official or lawyer, gather data and evidence, and decide on the 
defenses they will raise against the complaint. Moreover, in order to 
enable the employees to intelligently prepare their explanation and 
defenses, the notice should contain a detailed narration of the facts 
and circumstances that will serve as basis for the charge against the 
employees. A general description of the charge will not suffice. Lastly,
 the notice should specifically mention which company rules, if any, are
 violated and/or which among the grounds under Art. 282 (now 297) is 
being charged against the employees.

(2) After serving the first notice, the employers should schedule and 
conduct a 
hearing or conference
 wherein the employees will be 
given the opportunity to: (1) explain and clarify their defenses to the 
charge against them; (2) present evidence in support of their defenses; 
and (3) rebut the evidence presented against them by the management. 
During the hearing or conference, the employees are given the chance to 
defend themselves personally, with the assistance of a representative or
 counsel of their choice. Moreover, this conference or hearing could be 
used by the parties as an opportunity to come to an amicable settlement.

(3) After determining that termination of employment is justified, the 
employers shall serve the employees 
a written notice of termination 
indicating that: (1) all circumstances involving the charge against the 
employees have been considered; and (2) grounds have been established to
 justify the severance of their employment.
[110]


To comply with the requirements of procedural due process, two notices 
must be served to the employee. The conduct of a hearing or conference 
though is, as held in 
Perez v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Company
,
[111]

 mandatory only "when requested by the employee in writing or 
substantial evidentiary disputes exist or a company rule or practice 
requires it, or when similar circumstances justify it."
[112]

 Failure to comply with procedural due process (although the dismissal 
is based on just or authorized causes) will entitle the employee to 
nominal damages: if the dismissal is based on just cause, the employee 
is entitled to P30,000.00;
[113]
 if the dismissal is based on authorized cause, the employee is entitled to P50,000.00.
[114]


Lobetania, Dimaiwat, Velasco
and Aguirre voluntarily
resigned rendering their
complaints for illegal dismissal
without basis.


Respondents correctly argued that Lobetania, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and 
Aguirre had voluntarily tendered their resignation before filing their 
complaints for illegal dismissal. The NLRC ruled that this event 
rendered their complaints for illegal dismissal without basis as the 
employment relationship was severed before the effectivity date of its 
termination. Petitioners, on the other hand, did not contest this but 
insisted that there they were illegally dismissed.

The Court holds that petitioners' voluntary resignation effectively 
rendered their complaints for illegal dismissal without any basis.


Central Azucarera De Bais, Inc. v. Siason
[115]
 discusses the concept of resignation:


Resignation is the formal pronouncement or relinquishment of
 a position or office. It is the voluntary act of an employee who is in a
 situation where he believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed 
in favor of the exigency of the service, and he has then no other choice
 but to disassociate himself from employment. The intent to relinquish 
must concur with the overt act of relinquishment; hence, the acts of the
 employee before and after the alleged resignation must be considered in
 determining whether he in fact intended to terminate his employment. In
 illegal dismissal cases, it is a fundamental rule that when an employer
 interposes the defense of resignation, on him necessarily rests the 
burden to prove that the employee indeed voluntarily resigned.
[116]


For resignation from employment to be valid, there must be an intent to 
relinquish the position together with the overt act of relinquishment. 
Resignation must be voluntary. In illegal dismissal cases, the employer,
 if defense of resignation is presented, must show that the employee 
indeed voluntarily resigned. 
In the instant case, the fact of petitioners' resignation is undisputed.
 Lobetania tendered her resignation on July 27, 2007, and was approved 
by Atty. Ortega on August 9, 2007. Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre 
tendered their resignation on December 22, 2007, and these were approved
 by Atty. Ortega on December 26, 2007. In examining the totality of 
circumstances, respondents showed that Lobetania, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and
 Aguirre voluntarily resigned prior to the effectivity date of the 
termination of their employment. There were ongoing investigations 
against petitioners for the irregular acts they committed thereby 
placing them in a difficult position. Moreover, from the wording
[117]

 of the resignation letters, it can be implied that petitioners' 
resignations were voluntary. Though not the sole test, the wording of 
resignation letters may be considered as a factor, together with other 
circumstances, in assessing the voluntariness of a resignation.
[118]

 Also, to emphasize, petitioners did not contend or present 
countervailing evidence that their resignation was involuntary. 
Likewise, "it is settled that there is nothing reprehensible or illegal 
when the employer grants the employee a chance to resign and save face 
rather than smear the latter's employment record."
[119]
 
Thus, because of the voluntary resignations of Lobetania, Dimaiwat, 
Velasco, and Aguirre prior to the termination of their employment, their
 complaints for illegal dismissal have no basis. 
Even if we disregard their voluntary resignation, this Court agrees with
 the CA that Lobetania, Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre were dismissed 
for just causes. 
Lobetania's failure to remit and deposit the University's funds to its 
bank account amounted to a willful breach of trust. To constitute 
willful breach of trust, the employee concerned must be holding a 
position of trust and confidence, and there must be an act, that is 
willful, that would justify the loss of trust and confidence.
[120]

 Additionally, cashiers, auditors, property custodians, and those 
positions who, in the normal and routine exercise of their functions, 
regularly handle significant amounts of money or property are considered
 positions of trust.
[121]
 
These requisites are satisfied with respect to Lobetania. She is holding
 a position of trust because her duties as Credit and Collection Officer
 included safeguarding of the cash vault and depositing cash to the 
University's bank account, among others. The audit report proved that 
there were undeposited amounts that should have been inside the cash 
vault under Lobetania's custody but were unaccounted for. Therefore, 
Lobetania was validly dismissed for willful breach of trust. 

As to Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre, their collective act of taking 
undue advantage of the University's group enrollment incentive program 
despite knowledge that their children and relatives were unqualified 
amounted to fraud and dishonesty. The investigation conducted by 
respondents showed that petitioners enrolled their unqualified children 
and relatives in the program. Moreover, as confirmed by the CA, 
petitioners even admitted during a conference with Atty. Ortega that 
their children and relatives indeed benefitted from the unauthorized 
discounts. These acts constitute fraud which, as provided in Article 297
 of the Labor Code, is a ground that is separate and distinct from 
willful breach of trust.
[122]
 
Fraud and dishonesty can only be used to justify termination from 
employment when the employee concerned commits a dishonest act that 
reflects a disposition to deceive, defraud and betray the employer.
[123]


On the aspect of procedural due process, the Court deems it not 
necessary to discuss because, to reiterate, Lobetania, Dimaiwat, 
Velasco, and Aguirre all voluntarily resigned.

Consequently, it follows that petitioners are not entitled to backwages 
and other money claims arising from illegal dismissal. 


Bance's dismissal from 
employment is valid but

procedural due process was not 
observed by respondent.
 

As stated, Bance did not tender her resignation. She insists that she 
was illegally dismissed for lack of substantial and procedural due 
process. Respondents, on the other hand, argue that she was validly 
dismissed based on fraud resulting to willful breach of trust. The NLRC 
ruled that the dismissal was valid but procedural due process was not 
observed, awarding nominal damages in the amount of P5,000.00. The CA 
agreed but deleted the award of nominal damages and ruled that 
procedural due process was observed. 
The Court holds that Bance's dismissal was for a just cause. She 
willfully breached the trust that the University has reposed on her. 
Bance's act of accommodating into the University's group enrollment 
incentive program unqualified beneficiaries, including the children and 
relatives of the petitioners, constitute willful breach of trust. As 
stated, to constitute willful breach of trust, the employee concerned 
must be holding a position of trust and confidence, and there must be a 
willful act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence.
[124]
 In 
Alvarez v. Golden Tri Bloc, Inc.
,
[125]

 this Court ruled that a supervisory position is considered a position 
of trust because of the high degree of honesty and responsibility 
required and expected of the employee as compared with ordinary rank and
 file employees.
[126]
 
Hence, Bance's position as Senior Accounts Officer, being supervisory in
 nature, can be considered as a position of trust. The investigation 
conducted by respondents showed that Bance (with Dimaiwat, Velasco, and 
Aguirre) participated in the scheme in the incentive program by 
enrolling unqualified beneficiaries. Likewise, as confirmed by the CA, 
Bance admitted during a conference with Atty. Ortega and other 
petitioners that her children or relatives (as the case may be) 
benefitted from the unauthorized discounts. By her admission, Bance's 
act was willful. Such constitutes willful breach of the trust that the 
University has reposed on her. 

Having been dismissed for a just cause, it follows that Bance is not 
entitled to backwages and other money claims arising from an illegal 
dismissal. 
The Court, however, does not agree with the CA on its ruling on the 
aspect of procedural due process. As discussed above, to comply with the
 requirement of procedural due process, two written notices must be 
issued. The first written notice should contain the specific causes or 
grounds for termination against the employee. The second written notice 
contains the decision terminating the employment after considering all 
circumstances involving the charge. 
Records show that during the events leading to Bance's dismissal, two 
conferences were held, after which, Office Memo No. 007-026 was issued 
to inform her (and Dimaiwat, Velasco, and Aguirre) of the termination of
 her employment effective January 1, 2008. Clearly, these are not 
compliant with the requirements established by law. Only the second 
written notice or Office Memo No. 007-026, was served on Bance. The 
records show that no first written notice was given to Bance. 
Conferences and verbal announcements do not suffice as substitute for 
the requisite first written notice. 
Applying 
Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission
,
[127]
 Bance is therefore entitled to nominal damages in the amount of P30,000.00. 


The issue of reimbursement of the 
amount of Php1,239,856.25 to 
Lobetania is moot.
 

Petitioners argue that Lobetania paid Atty. Ortega the amount of 
PI,239,856.25 because of the latter's threats. They claim that the 
amount arose from an employer-employee relationship. Respondents, as 
affirmed by both the CA and NLRC, contend that the amount did not arise 
from employer-employee relationship. 

The Court concludes otherwise and rules that, after a judicious review 
of the records, respondents are not liable to reimburse the amount to 
Lobetania. As found, the amount pertains to the cash shortage that was 
unaccounted for. Lobetania subsequently paid the amounts to the 
University as evidenced by official receipts
[128]

 issued by the University under her name. It can then be concluded that 
the purpose of the payment was to return the cash shortage. Thus, the 
University is not obligated to return this amount to Lobetania. 

If Lobetania insists that there was a personal accommodation between her
 and Mrs. Ortega, the NLRC and the CA are correct in ruling that the 
matter should be litigated before the regular courts. In unpaid debts 
such as this, the facet of employer-employee relationship is merely 
incidental and the cause of action proceeds from a different source of 
obligation.
[129]


Lastly, there is no reason to disturb the CA and NLRC's finding that 
respondents are liable to pay petitioners their holiday pay for the 
three (3) years preceding their resignation. Likewise, the Court agrees 
that respondents are liable to pay Lobetania her 13
th
 month 
pay for the year 2007, prorated to the months she was still in 
employment. For both instances, respondents failed to present proof of 
payment.
