DELOS SANTOS, J.:


 Assailed before the Court, through a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the Decision
[2]
 dated August 31, 2016 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated May 15, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 104140, which set aside the Order
[4]

 dated November 10, 2014 remanding the case to the Regional Trial Court 
(RTC) of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, Branch 25, for further proceedings. 
The Antecedents


On June 26, 2014, Michael Gonzales and Mario Solomon Gonzales 
(respondents) filed a Complaint for Recovery of Possession and Damages 
under Civil Case No. 495
[5]
 (unlawful detainer) against the spouses Rolando
[6]
and Fe Tobias (petitioners) before the RTC alleging that they are the owners of a 1,057-square meter parcel of land located in 
Barangay

 Del Pilar, Tagudin, Ilocos Sur covered by Transfer Certificate of Title
 (TCT) No. 024Â­2013000860. The said parcel of land, on which a house was
 built, was in possession of petitioners who also reside in the said 
property. Consequently, respondents sent a notice to vacate, but they 
were unsuccessful as petitioners refused to vacate the property. As a 
result, the Complaint
[7]
 for recovery of possession based on ownership under Civil Case No. 01546-T was filed by respondents.
[8]


Subsequently, petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss based on 
litis pendentia

 and forum shopping, citing that respondents had previously filed a 
complaint for unlawful detainer against them involving the same property
 before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Tagudin-Suyo, Ilocos Sur. 
Petitioners averred that the complaint for unlawful detainer and 
recovery of possession based on ownership have the same causes of action
 since both were instituted by respondents to gain possession of the 
house and lot. Additionally, petitioners contended that the Verification
 and Certification Against Forum Shopping submitted by respondents is 
defective because it was only signed by their attorneys-in-fact. 
Moreover, the Special Power of Attorney (SPA) authorized the 
attorneys-in-fact to file a complaint regarding a property covered by 
TCT No. T-47672 in the name of Elias Villanueva and not TCT No. 
024-2013000860 in the name of respondents. Therefore, the Complaint for 
Recovery of Possession based on ownership, according to petitioners, is 
no more than a mere scrap of paper.
[9]


In their opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, respondents contended that there is no 
litis pendentia
 because the causes of action are different. The cause of action in the unlawful detainer case is only possession 
de facto
 while the cause of action for the recovery of possession based on ownership is possession 
de jure
.
 Also, respondents averred that the signatures of their 
attorneys-in-fact did not violate the requirement that the Verification 
and Certification Against Forum Shopping must be personally signed by 
the parties since it was accompanied by an SPA. To explain the 
difference in TCT No. T-47672 referred to in the SPA to TCT No. 
024-2013000860 which is the subject property, respondents reasoned out 
that this was because the SPA was executed prior to the issuance of TCT 
No. 024-2013000860 on July 25, 2013. Nevertheless, the SPA subsists 
since it refers to the same property despite the changes in the 
certificates of title.
[10]


Ruling of the RTC


On November 10, 2014, the RTC issued an Order
[11]
 dismissing respondents' complaint for recovery of possession based on ownership, ratiocinating, thus:


It is thus beyond cavil that inasmuch as plaintiffs in this 
case merely reiterated the basis of their ownership which was already 
passed upon in previous proceedings, as the foundation of their present 
case against the same defendants, the elements of [
litis pendentia
]
 and forum shopping are present. If this case will be allowed to 
prosper, the courts will be trying the same issues all over again and 
conflicting decisions are a certainty. This is anathema to the proper 
administration of justice as capsulized in the two latin maxims: "[
republicae ut sit litium
]" (it is to the interest of the State that there should [be] and end to litigation) and "[
nemo debet bis vexari et eadem causa
]"
 (no person should be vexed twice for the same cause).

WHEREFORE, premises considered[,] this case is ordered DISMISSED for 
lack of merit as it would constitute [forum shopping] and violates the 
rule against [
litis pendentia
].

SO ORDERED.
[12]


Undaunted, respondents filed an appeal to the CA raising the issue of whether there was 
litis pendentia

 between the unlawful detainer case and the complaint for recovery of 
possession based on ownership and whether respondents are guilty of 
forum shopping, among others.
[13]


Ruling of the CA


In its August 31, 2016 Decision,
[14]
 the CA granted the appeal and set aside the November 10, 2014 Order of the RTC. The 
fallo
 of the Decision of the appellate court reads:


ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is GRANTED. The November 10, 2014 
Order is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court 
of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, Branch 25, for further proceedings with 
dispatch.

SO ORDERED.
[15]


Despite petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, the CA affirmed its August 31, 2016 Decision 
via
 the May 15, 2017 Resolution.
[16]


Hence, this Petition.

A Comment
[17]
 to the petition dated October 25, 2017 was filed by respondents and a Reply
[18]
 to the Comment dated December 1, 2017, was filed by petitioners subsequently. 
The Issues


Petitioners anchor their prayer for the reversal of the August 31, 2016 
Decision and the May 15, 2017 Resolution of the CA based on the 
following issues:


Whether or not the Honorable Court 
a quo

 gravely erred under [the] law when it held that the causes of action in
 Civil Case No. 495 (unlawful detainer) and Civil Case No. 01546-T are 
different.


Whether or not the Honorable Court 
a quo
 gravely erred under [the] law when it held that there is no forum shopping.
[19]


The Court's Ruling


After a careful perusal of the arguments presented and the evidence 
submitted, the Court finds no merit in the petition.


Petitioners argue that respondents violated the rule against forum 
shopping when Civil Case No. 01546-T was filed before Civil Case No. 495
 became final and executory, both cases being founded on the same facts,
 cause of action, and relief sought. 

Specifically, petitioners contend that there is identity in the causes 
of action in Civil Case No. 495 and Civil Case No. 01546-T because both 
involve the issue of possession where respondents, in both cases, anchor
 their right to possess from their alleged ownership of the property 
such that the evidence for Civil Case No. 495 for the unlawful detainer 
is the same evidence that will be utilized for Civil Case No. 01546-T, a
 reivindicatory action.


It is a fundamental principle of civil law that the owner of real 
property is entitled to the possession thereof as an attribute of his or
 her ownership. Verily, the holder of a Torrens Title is the rightful 
owner of the property thereby covered, and is entitled to its 
possession.
[20]
 This notwithstanding, "the owner cannot simply wrest possession thereof from whoever is in actual occupation of the property."
[21]

 Rather, to recover possession, the owner must first resort to the 
proper judicial remedy, and thereafter, satisfy all the conditions 
necessary for such action to prosper.
[22]


Accordingly, the owner may decide among three kinds of actions to recover possession of real property â an 
accion interdictal, accion publiciana or an accion reivindicatoria
, thus:


Accion interdictal
 comprises two distinct causes of action, namely, forcible entry 
(detentacion)
 and unlawful detainer 
(desahuico)

 [sic]. In forcible entry, one is deprived of physical possession of 
real property by means of force, intimidation, strategy, threats, or 
stealth whereas in unlawful detainer, one illegally withholds possession
 after the expiration or termination of his right to hold possession 
under any contract, express or implied. The two are distinguished from 
each other in that in forcible entry, the possession of the defendant is
 illegal from the beginning, and that the issue is which party has prior
 
de facto
 possession while in unlawful detainer, possession of 
the defendant is originally legal but became illegal due to the 
expiration or termination of the right to possess.

The jurisdiction of these two actions, which are summary in nature, lies
 in the proper municipal trial court or metropolitan trial court. Both 
actions must be brought within one year from the date of actual entry on
 the land, in case of forcible entry, and from the date of last demand, 
in case of unlawful detainer. The issue in said cases is the right to 
physical possession.


Accion publiciana
 is the plenary action to recover the right of 
possession which should be brought in the proper regional trial court 
when dispossession has lasted for more than one year. It is an ordinary 
civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession of realty 
independently of title. In other words, if at the time of the filing of 
the complaint more than one year had elapsed since defendant had turned 
plaintiff out of possession or defendant's possession had become 
illegal, the action will be, not one of the forcible entry or illegal 
detainer, but an 
accion publiciana
. On the other hand, 
accion reivindicatoria
 is an action to recover ownership also brought in the proper regional trial court in an ordinary civil proceeding.
[23]


In an ejectment suit 
(action interdictal)
, the sole issue is the 
right of physical or material possession over the subject real property 
independent of any claim of ownership by the parties involved. Ownership
 over the property is immaterial and is only passed upon 
provisionally
 for the limited purpose of determining which party has the better right to possession.
[24]
 
On the other hand, 
accion reivindicatoria
 or 
action de reivindicacion

 is an action whereby plaintiff claims ownership over a parcel of land 
and seeks recovery of its full possession. It is a suit to recover 
possession of a parcel of land as an element of ownership.
[25]
 In 
Amoroso v. Alegre, Jr.
,
[26]
 the Court held that an 
accion
 reivindicatoria is an action instituted to recover possession of a 
parcel of land as an element of ownership. "It is an action whereby the 
plaintiff alleges ownership over a parcel of land and seeks recovery of 
its full possession. The judgment in such a case determines the 
ownership of the property and awards the possession of the property to 
the lawful owner
."
[27]
 
Moreover, the evidentiary requirement for unlawful detainer and 
accion reivindicatoria

 is distinct from each other. In unlawful detainer, it is required that 
the aggrieved party allege lawful possession that turned to be unlawful 
by the party withholding possession under any contract, express or 
implied.
[28]
 However, in an 
action reivindicatoria
,
 no such evidence is required since it is an accion based on ownership 
over a parcel of land, seeking recovery of its full possession.
[29]

 Simply put, evidence of prior physical possession and of the subsequent
 unlawfulness of possession is irrelevant.

On the basis of the foregoing, it is unmistakable that the causes of 
action in Civil Case No. 495 and Civil Case No. 01546-T are different. 
While the parties are the same, the sole issue in Civil Case No. 495 is 
the right of physical or material possession over the subject real 
property independent of any claim of ownership by the parties involved. 
Contrastingly, the issue to be resolved in Civil Case No. 01546-T is the
 ownership of the property claimed. 

Anent the issue of whether or not there is forum shopping, forum 
shopping is defined as the filing of multiple suits involving the same 
parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or 
successively, for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment. It 
exists where the elements of 
litis pendentia
 are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to 
res judicata
 in another.
[30]


For 
litis pendentia
 to be a ground for the dismissal of an 
action, the following requisites must concur: (a) identity of parties, 
or at least such parties who represent the same interests in both 
actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the 
relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity with 
respect to the two preceding particulars in the two cases is such that 
any judgment that may be rendered in the pending case, regardless of 
which party is successful, would amount to 
res judicata
 in the other case.
[31]
 

Here, the elements of forum shopping are not present. It must be 
recalled that respondents, in the beginning, filed an unlawful detainer 
suit. Afterwards, respondents filed an action to recover possession 
based on ownership or 
accion reivindicatoria
.

While it is true that the parties and the subject matter in both cases 
are the same, the causes of action and the reliefs prayed for axe 
different from each other. In the unlawful detainer case under Civil 
Case No. 495, the main issue to be resolved by the Court is who has the 
better right of possession over the property regardless of the aspect of
 ownership of the property. On the other hand, it is in the action to 
recover possession based on ownership or 
accion reivindicatoria
 that the matter of ownership will be threshed out.

Indeed, 
accion reivindicatoria
 is an action for the recovery of ownership which includes the recovery of possession.
[32]
 
The rationale of the rule regarding the difference of unlawful detainer to 
accion reivindicatoria
 is that the former involves only the issue of material possession or possession 
de facto
,
 while the latter involves the question of ownership. There may be 
identity of parties and subject matter, but not of the cause of action 
or the relief prayed for.
[33]


Consequently, it is obvious that 
litis pendentia
 is not present in the case at bar because the second and third requisites are wanting.


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the Petition is 
DENIED
. 
Accordingly, the Decision dated August 31, 2016 and the Resolution dated
 May 15, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104140 are 
hereby 
AFFIRMED
