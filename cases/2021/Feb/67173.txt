RE: LETTER DATED MARCH 9, 2020 OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SECRETARY FRANCISCO T. DUQUE III, MD, MSC, RE: SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS CASE NO. R-MNL-19-12843-SP (JBROS CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION/FUJIAN[1] ZHONGMA CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING CO., LTD. CONSORTIUM AND/OR JBROS CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION, BOTH REPRESENTED BY ENGR. JESUSITO B. LEGASPI, JR. V. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, HON. FRANCISCO T. DUQUE III, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, AND THE GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT POLICY BOARD).
RESOLUTION




GESMUNDO, J.:




The instant administrative matter stems from a Letter
[2]

 dated March 9, 2020 of the Honorable Secretary of the Department of 
Health, Hon. Francisco T. Duque III, addressed to the Honorable Chief 
Justice Diosdado M. Peralta, calling the attention of the Court on the 
alleged improper issuance of a preliminary injunction by the Regional 
Trial Court (RTC), Manila, Branch 27 in Spec. Pro. Case No. 
R-MNL-19-12843-SP presided by Judge Teresa Patrimonio-Soriaso (
Judge Soriaso
)
 despite the denial of the same application in an earlier case filed 
before RTC Manila, Branch 12, docketed as Civil Case No. 19-09240-SC, 
presided by Judge Renata Z. Enciso (
Judge Enciso
).



    The Court referred the matter to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for Investigation, Report and Recommendation.



    In a Memorandum
[3]
 dated 
January 7, 2021, the OCA submitted its report and recommendation to the 
Court. The OCA summarized the controversy in this manner:




The instant administrative matter stemmed from the 
Blacklisting Order dated 20 May 2019 issued by the Department of Health 
(DOH) against JBros Construction Corporation (JBROS) for alleged 
irregularities and failure to deliver on Phase II of its "
Barangay

 Health Stations Project." JBROS contested the blacklisting order by 
filing separate petitions in two (2) Regional Trial Courts, with said 
courts issuing contrasting orders.



As culled from the 9 March 2020 Letter (with attachments) of DOH Secretary Francisco T. Duque III, the "
Barangay

 Health Stations Project" was launched to make quality health care 
accessible to the poor. The project was supposed to provide a functional
 
Barangay
 Health Station in every 
barangay
, using public elementary schools as the sites.



Through competitive public bidding, JBROS entered into two (2) contracts
 with the DOH. The contracts were made in accordance with Section 59, 
Article XVIII if Republic Act No. 9184 (
Government Procurement Reform Act
)
 which provides that any dispute arising from the implementation of the 
contract entered into under said Act shall be submitted to arbitration 
in the Philippines. The process of arbitration was incorporated in the 
contracts pursuant to the provisions of the Act.



The first contract was for the construction of the 
Barangay
 
Health Stations. The contract of Phase I of the project was executed on 
22 January 2016. Phase I of the project actually became the subject of 
an arbitration case between the parties.



The second contract, Phase II of the project, was executed between JBROS
 and DOH on March 2016. Supposedly, the DOH had until 30 March 2016 to 
give possession of all 2,500 sites to JBROS. It was the contention of 
JBROS that the completion of Phase II was contingent on the DOH 
completely delivering the identified sites. In a Letter dated 16 May 
2016, addressed to then DOH Secretary Janette Garin, JBROS pointed to 
various reasons for the delay in Phase II, including the undue delay in 
the determination of the replacement school sites. Apparently, the 
Regional Directors of the DOH had not been informed of the project, 
preventing JBROS from commencing work on the identified sites.



The second contract was suspended on 31 May 2016 by the DOH, but JBROS 
claimed that it had accomplished at least 14.37% of the works. JBROS 
requested the DOH to lift the suspension of Phase II, but the request 
fell on deaf ears.



With Phase II of the project suspended for almost three (3) years 
starting in May 2016, JBROS sent a Notice of Termination dated 25 
January 2019 pursuant to R.A. [No.] 9184 which grants JBROS the right to
 terminate the contract that had been suspended for at least sixty (60) 
days. Under R.A. No. 9184, the DOH had another thirty (30) days from 
receipt of notice to resolve the grounds for suspension and/or lift the 
same, otherwise the contract shall be deemed terminated by operation of 
law. When the DOH failed to do its part, the contract was deemed 
terminated by operation of law on 24 February 2019.





Following JBROS' early termination, it was taken by surprise when it 
received a Notice of Termination from the DOH dated 1 March 2019. 
Attached to the notice was a verified report dated 21 February 2019 
detailing the alleged irregularities committed by JBROS relative to 
Phase II of the project.





In the interim, JBROS countered with a letter demanding payment of its 
claims arising out of the termination of the contract. The DOH issued an
 Amended Notice of Termination on 4 April 2019, along with a 
Supplemental Verified Report alleging the same grounds for termination 
cited in the first notice. JBROS, in a Letter dated 23 April 2019, 
insisted that Phase II of the project was terminated due to the DOH's 
fault.



On 20 May 2019, some three (3) months after JBROS terminated the 
contract, the DOH issued a decision declaring the contract as 
terminated. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:


"WHEREFORE, premises considered this Office resolves to:


DECLARE the subject Contract as TERMINATED;


DENY the demand for payment for failure to prove Respondent's claim;


BLACKLIST the Contractor for engaging in unlawful acts relative
 to the contract acquisition and implementation, pursuant to GPPB 
Guidelines for Blacklisting[;] and


DEMAND the return of the mobilization fee in the amount of Five
 Hundred Fifty-One Million Two Hundred [Thirty]-Three Thousand Three 
Hundred Thirty-Three and 33/100 Pesos (P551,233,333.33).["]



A motion for reconsideration of the decision was denied by the DOH in a Resolution dated 15 July 2019.



On July 24, 2019, the DOH issued the formal Blacklisting Order 
disqualifying JBROS from participating in the procurement of all 
governmental projects from 28 August 2019 to 28 August 2020. In its 
letter dated 30 August 2019, the Government Procurement Policy Board 
(GPPB) confirmed the inclusion of JBROS in the Consolidated Blacklist 
Report.



As aforementioned, the Blacklisting Order dated 20 May 2019 of the DOH 
became the point of dispute between JBROS and DOH and the GPPB.



Questioning the blacklisting order, JBROS filed a Petition for 
Certiorari
 with application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) or 
Status Quo Ante

 Order and a Writ of Preliminary Injunction. The petition was raffled to
 Branch 12, RTC, Manila, and docketed as Civil Case No. 19-09240-SC.



In an Order dated 26 September 2019, Presiding Judge Renato Z. Encisco, 
Branch 12, RTC, Manila, denied the prayer of JBROS for the issuance of a
 writ of preliminary injunction. Judge Enciso's main argument was that 
the acts sought to be enjoined by JBROS were already performed or 
completed prior to the filing of the petition, hence there was nothing 
more to be enjoined or restrained. Instead, Judge Enciso directed the 
parties to file their respective memoranda. However, JBROS withdrew the 
case. In its Motion to Dismiss dated 3 October 2019, JBROS claimed that 
the case may still be dismissed as a matter of right considering that 
the respondents had yet to file any responsive pleading. The motion 
sought the dismissal of the case without prejudice. Judge Enciso granted
 the motion in his Order dated 14 October 2019.



JBROS refiled the case designating it as a "Petition for Interim Measure
 of Protection in Aid of Arbitration under the Alternative Dispute 
Resolution Act (R.A. No. 9285)" with an urgent motion for ex parte 
issuance of a 20-day Temporary Restraining Order of Protection (TROP). 
The case was raffled to Branch 27, RTC, Manila, and docketed as Special 
Proceeding Case No. R-MNL-19-12843-SP.



In an Order dated 19 December 2019, Judge Lily Joy LabayoÂ­Patria, in her
 capacity as Pairing Judge of Branch 27, RTC, Manila, issued the 20-day 
TROP prayed for by JBROS. The DOH filed a motion for reconsideration but
 in an Order dated 20 January 2020, Judge Teresa Patrimonio-Soriaso, 
Presiding Judge, Branch 27, RTC, Manila denied the motion for being moot
 and academic, the 20-day TROP having already expired.



Judge Patrimonio-Soriaso proceeded to hear the application for a writ of
 preliminary injunction. In an Order dated 20 January 2020, she issued a
 writ of preliminary injunction directing the DOH to desist from 
implementing the termination of the contract, recall the blacklisting 
order and submit a Delisting Order to the GPPB notifying it of the 
delisting of JBROS. The reliefs granted by Judge Patrimonio-Soriaso 
removed JBROS from the GPPB's list of blacklisted entities. The DOH, 
through the Office of the Solicitor General, has since filed a Motion 
for Inhibition and a Motion for Reconsideration."
[4]
 (emphases omitted)




Eventually, the OCA found sufficient grounds to make Judge Soriaso 
administratively liable when she issued a writ of preliminary injunction
 against the earlier dismissal order of Judge Enciso in violation of the
 doctrine of judicial stability. It also noted that the issuance of the 
writ of preliminary injunction is erroneous as the acts sought to be 
restrained had already been executed prior to any judicial intercession.
 Lastly, the OCA noticed that Judge Soriaso failed to recognize that 
JBROS had committed forum shopping when it nonchalantly moved for the 
dismissal of the case pending before Judge Enciso after receiving an 
unfavorable judgment by thereafter filing a similar petition hoping for a
 more favorable outcome.




Thus, the OCA recommended that: (1) the DOH letter be considered as a 
formal complaint against Judge Soriaso, (2) she be furnished a copy of 
the letter, and (3) she be required to comment.




In response, Judge Soriaso disavowed any liability to the charge of 
violation of forum shopping claiming that the two petitions, the one 
filed before the 
sala
 of Judge Enciso and the other in her 
sala
,
 were two different cases that do not preclude one another, thereby 
concluding that no violation was made. Also, Judge Soriaso avers she did
 not violate the doctrine of judicial stability when she took cognizance
 of the special proceeding, the civil case before Judge Enciso being 
already dismissed; thus no outstanding order was contradicted by her 
grant of the writ of preliminary injunction. Lastly, she raises good 
faith and argues that she did not know of the existence of the case 
filed before the sala of Judge Enciso and the issuance of the writ of 
preliminary injunction was based on the facts presented during the 
hearing.







 






Considering the answer of Judge Soriaso, the OCA maintained that she be 
made administratively liable for violating the doctrine of judicial 
stability as well as the rule on forum shopping. The OCA found that her 
actions were not justified. First, the OCA pointed out that while 
captioned differently, the two cases seek the same remedy - to thwart 
the blacklisting of JBROS. Second, it found that Judge Soriaso cannot 
feign ignorance of the earlier ruling of Judge Enciso since she was 
informed by the DOH of the same. For this, the OCA recommended that 
Judge Soriaso be found guilty of: (i) a serious charge of Gross 
Ignorance of the Law or Procedure and fined in the amount of P20,000.00,
 and (ii) the less serious charge of violation of Supreme Court rules, 
directives and circulars relating to the issuance of writs of 
preliminary injunction and fined the additional amount of P10,000.00.
[5]


The Court's Ruling




The Court adopts the recommendation of the OCA save for the recommended penalty.




It is doctrinal that though not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance 
of the law and that, if committed in good faith, does not warrant 
administrative sanction, the same applies only in cases within the 
parameters of tolerable misjudgment. Where the law is straightforward 
and the facts so evident, not to know it or to act as if one does not 
know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law. One who accepts the 
exalted position of a judge owes the public and the court the ability to
 be proficient in the law and the duty to maintain professional 
competence at all times. When a judge displays an utter lack of 
familiarity with the rules, he erodes the confidence of the public in 
the courts. A judge owes the public and the court the duty to be 
proficient in the law and is expected to keep abreast of laws and 
prevailing jurisprudence. Ignorance of the law by a judge can easily be 
the mainspring of injustice.
[6]




In this regard, the doctrine of judicial stability or the doctrine of 
nonÂ­interference states that the judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any court of concurrent 
jurisdiction. The rationale for the same is founded on the concept of 
jurisdiction - verily, a court that acquires jurisdiction over the case 
and renders judgment therein has jurisdiction over its judgment, to the 
exclusion of all other coordinate courts, for its execution and over all
 its incidents, and to control, in furtherance of justice, the conduct 
of ministerial officers acting in connection with this judgment.
[7]

 It is an elementary principle in the administration of justice: no 
court can interfere by injunction with the judgments or orders of 
another court of concurrent jurisdiction having the power to grant the 
relief sought by the injunction.
[8]




Here, if Judge Soriaso had just heeded the information provided by the 
DOH regarding the existence of the earlier decision of Judge Enciso, she
 would have been more circumspect in the eventual issuance of the writ 
of preliminary injunction realizing the ruse propagated by JBROS to get a
 favorable judgment. Surely, as the OCA correctly pointed out, Judge 
Soriaso's eventual issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction causes
 confusion as to which order the parties should follow: the initial 
decision of Judge Enciso denying the application of the writ or the 
subsequent decision of Judge Soriaso? This could have easily been 
avoided if only Judge Soriaso observed the aforementioned doctrine.




Further, the circumstance above is a textbook example of forum shopping.
 Jurisprudentially, the test for determining forum shopping is whether 
in the two (or more) cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights
 or causes of action, and reliefs sought.
[9]

 Here, while the nomenclature used was different, both cases seek the 
same outcome. Also, both cases involve the same parties. Lastly, the 
same evidence is required to prove both cases. The OCA is, therefore, 
correct in finding Judge Soriaso guilty of gross ignorance of the law 
for violating the rule on forum shopping and the doctrine of judicial 
stability.




Likewise, the Court is convinced that Judge Soriaso failed to comply with Administrative Circular No. 7-99.
[10]

 She utterly failed to notice that the contract between JBROS and the 
DOH had long been extinguished. As such, the same cannot be the source 
of any right to be protected by injunction. Also, as correctly ruled 
upon by Judge Enciso, the acts sought to be enjoined have already been 
accomplished. The settled rule is that an injunction would not lie where
 the acts sought to be enjoined had become 
fait accompli
 - an accomplished or consummated act.
[11]

 It is thus undeniable that Judge Soriaso erroneously issued the writ of
 preliminary injunction despite two glaring warning signs signs she 
would have surely taken into consideration had she not taken a 
nonchalant attitude towards Judge Enciso's earlier decision.




Due to the gravity of the infractions committed by Judge Soriaso, the 
Court cannot accept the penalty recommended by the OCA. Instead, the 
Court resolves to impose a fine amounting to Forty Thousand Pesos 
(P40,000.00) for gross ignorance of the rules of procedure and another 
Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) for violating Administrative Circular 
No. 7-99.


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Court finds Judge Teresa Patrimonio-Soriaso 
GUILTY
 of Gross Ignorance of the Law and Procedure and 
IMPOSES
 a 
FINE
 in the amount of Forty Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00). The Court, likewise, finds Judge Soriaso 
GUILTY
 ofthe less grave offense of violation of Administrative Circular No. 7-99 and is 
IMPOSED
 an additional 
FINE
 in the amount of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00). Judge Soriaso is hereby 
WARNED
 that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future shall merit a more severe sanction from the Court.


SO ORDERED.
