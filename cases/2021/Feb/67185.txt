INTING, J.:


This resolves the Petition for 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (COA Proper) Decision
[2]
 dated November 15, 2010 (Original COA Proper Decision) and the Resolution
[3]
 dated September 27, 2013. The assailed issuances upheld Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. BMHI-04-002-(03)
[4]
 dated November 4, 2004 and Supplemental ND No. BMHI-2008-008
[5]
 dated March 26, 2008 which 
disallowed
 the Annual Gift Checks (AGCs)
[6]
 paid by Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) Management and Holdings, Inc. (BMHI) amounting to P2,158,000.00 and P754,000.00,
[7]
 respectively, and held the payees, certifying and approving officers, liable therefore.
The Antecedents
BCDA was created pursuant to Republic Act No. 7227
[8]
 to act as the lead instrumentality tasked to facilitate the conversion of the Clark and Subic military reservations and extensions into alternative productive uses.
[9]
 Herein petitioners
[10]
 are employees of BMHI, a subsidiary of BCDA.
[11]
On September 18, 2003, the BCDA Board of Directors (Board) approved Resolution No. 2003-09-186 authorizing the payment of 2003 AGCs.
[12]
 The Guidelines on the Grant of the AGCs
[13]
 provide as follows:
1. COVERAGE
1.1 
Annual gift checks shall be granted to all BCDA regular plantilla personnel and contractual officers and employees including the members of the Board, office-based consultants and 
those on detail from other government agencies rendering full time service to BCDA
 and who are in the service as of 30 September 2003.
1.2
 The gift check shall be equivalent to at least P35,000.00 net of tax.
1.3
 x x x
1.4 
For this purpose, services rendered continuously by employees of BMHI
, the BCDA Manpower Services provider, office-based consultants performing BCDA functions who were subsequently hired by BCDA prior to 30 September 2003 
are considered actual service in BCDA
.
[14]
 (Italics supplied.)
On the strength of their 
parent company's
 Board Resolution No. 2003-09-186 and guidelines, BMHI management released the AGCs to its employees and the members of the Board, through Disbursement Voucher (DV) Nos. 2003-09-130
[15]
 and 2003-09-131
[16]
 dated September 23, 2003, amounting to P2,569,000.00 and P343,000.00, respectively.
The payment was 
approved
 by Isaac S. Puno III (Puno), BMHI President. It was also 
certified
 by Rowena B. Tanagon (Tanagon), Department/Unit Head, and Glorificacion M. Nocos (Nocos), Accounting Department Head, as follows: (a) that the "expenses/advances [are] necessary, lawful and incurred under [her] direct supervision" and (b) that "supporting documents [are] complete and proper, and cash [is] available," respectively.
[17]
On March 31, 2004, the COA, relative to the payment of AGCs through Corazon V. EspaÃ±o, Audit Team Supervisor, issued 
Audit Observation Memorandum No. (AOM) 2004-05
[18]
 addressed to Puno. According to the COA, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) prescribes that year-end and other fringe benefits, such as the AGCs, are 
personnel benefits
 granted in addition to salaries, or paid only when basic salary is also paid. The members of the BMHI Board are not entitled to these benefits because they are not salaried government officials.
[19]
 In this regard, the COA requested Puno/BMHI to explain why the subject payment to non-salaried personnel should not be disallowed in audit.
[20]
Thereafter, the COA evaluated the matters raised in the AOM, together with relevant supporting documents. Consequently, the COA Legal and Adjudication Office-Corporate (LAO-C), through Rogelio D. Tablang, Director IV, issued 
ND No. BMHI-04-002-(03)
[21]
 dated November 4, 2004 disallowing the P2,158,000.00 of the total P2,912,000.00 paid for AGCs, computed as follows:
DV No.
Payees
Paid 
Disallowed
2003-09-130 
BMHI Employees/Personnel 
P2,569,000.00
 P1,835,000.00
2003-09-131
Members of BMHI Board
343,000.00
323,000.00 
Total
P2,912,000.00 
P2,158,000.00 
The COA disallowed the above-mentioned amounts for the following reasons: 
first
, P1,835,000.00 from DV No. 2003-09-130 was paid in excess of the rate authorized under the DBM approved corporate budget; and 
second
, P323,000.00 from DV No. 2003-09-131 was paid to the members of the Board, non-salaried employees, contrary to DBM Circular No. 2002-2 dated January 2, 2002.
[22]
The following BMHI personnel were held liable for the disallowance: (a) Tanagon and Nocos as 
certifiers
; (b) Puno as 
approver
; and (c) all 
payees
 who received the AGCs.
[23]
Aggrieved, these personnel, in their personal capacities, appealed
[24]
 the disallowance which was treated as a motion for reconsideration.
[25]
Ruling of the COA Director
In LAO-C Decision No. 2008-011
[26]
 dated March 4, 2008, Janet D. Nacion, Director IV upheld the disallowance, 
viz
.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the disallowance of subject [AGCs] is hereby AFFIRMED. In addition, the P10,000.00 out of the P35,000.00 [AGCs], granted to each personnel not previously disallowed in audit, is hereby disallowed for lack of legal basis. Accordingly, an ND disallowing the P10,000.00 portion of the P35,000.00 [AGCs] shall now be issued by this Office.
[27]
The Director explained as follows: 
first
, BMHI's employees are not automatically entitled to the benefits accruing to the personnel of the 
parent corporation
. BMHI, a 
subsidiary
, has a personality separate and distinct from BCDA, its 
parent
. BCDA Board Resolution No. 2003-09-186 cannot justify BMHI's grant/payment of AGCs to the latter's employees. Verily, BMHI's own Board is empowered to adopt a compensation plan and prepare/approve BMHI's annual budget. However, the BMHI Board did not pass a separate resolution exercising these powers to grant the subject AGCs.
[28]
 
Second
, the BMHI Board is not entitled to AGCs. Under the BMHI by-laws; the members of the Board shall be entitled only to a reasonable 
per diem
 allowance per board meeting and 
compensation
, which shall not exceed 10% of the preceding year's net income before income tax.
Based on this ruling, the LAO-C issued 
Supplemental ND No. BMHI-2008-008
[29]
 dated March 26, 2008 to 
completely
 disallow the payment for AGCs amounting to P2,912,000.00, not merely portions thereof.
Undaunted, the persons held liable for the disallowance appealed
[30]
 to the COA Proper.
Ruling of the COA Proper
A. Original COA Proper Decision.
 
 In the assailed 
Original COA Proper Decision
, the COA Proper sustained the disallowance for lack of legal basis.
[31]
 It reiterated that the BMHI Board did not pass a resolution granting AGCs to BMHI personnel, from BCDA Board Resolution No. 2003-09-186. "BMHI employees are not automatically entitled to whatever benefits the BCDA may grant to its personnel precisely because BCDA and BMHI have distinct and separate juridical personalities."
[32]
The appellants pointed out that the BMHI Board issued Resolution No. 04-15 dated April 15, 2008 ratifying the grant of AGCs. However, the COA Proper ruled that this does not "cure the defect of the irregular disbursement x x x because BMHI did not have authority to grant something which its parent corporation, the BCDA, did not have authority to grant."
Furthermore, Administrative Order No. (AO) 37
[33]
 dated November 21, 1998 and DBM Circular No. 16-98 dated November 26, 1998, prohibit government-owned and -controlled corporations from granting incentives and/or allowances, unless previously authorized by the Office of the President 
via
 administrative order.
[34]
Lastly, relying on 
Executive Director Casal v. Commission on Audit
,
[35]
 the COA Proper ruled on the appellants' liabilities as follows: (a) all 
payees
, except the members of the Board, are absolved from liability, having received the AGCs without participating in the approval thereof and without knowledge that the grant lacked legal basis; (b) the 
members of the Board
 are liable to refund the amounts they received because as non-BMHI employees, they are not authorized to receive such benefits; and (c) the BMHI officials who 
approved/ratified
 the payments shall be liable for the total amount.
[36]
 Their patent disregard of the applicable issuances amounted to gross negligence. The aggrieved parties, consisting of the BMHI Board and 
officials who approved/certified
 the subject disbursements, moved
[37]
 for reconsideration.
B. Resolution dated September 27, 2013 
 
In its assailed 
Resolution
, the COA Proper upheld the disallowance for lack of the requisite executive approval, as required by AO 37.
[38]
 However, it restored the payees' liability to return the disallowed amount and declared that the payees' obligation to refund is founded on the principles of implied trust
[39]
 and unjust enrichment.
[40]
 Thus, good faith is not a defense.
[41]
Hence, petitioners who are the payees of the disallowed amount filed the present petition.
Petitioners assert that the COA Proper gravely abused its discretion in the following instances: 
first
, when it upheld the disallowance based on grounds other than those cited by the Director;
[42]
 
second
, when it gave due course to the motion filed by the BMHI Board and officials to reconsider the Original COA Proper Decision despite the lapse of the reglementary period for filing an appeal; and 
third
, when it reversed the Original COA Proper Decision and required the payees to refund the amounts they received.
The Issue
Did the COA Proper commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in upholding the disallowance and holding the petitioners/payees, the BMHI Board, an other approving/certifying officials liable therefor?
The Courts Ruling
The Court upholds the disallowance of the payment for AGCs, as well as the payees' concomitant liability for the following reasons: 
first
, the ruling had already attained finality; and 
second
, in any case, the ruling is in accord with the law and prevailing jurisprudence.
The disallowance already attained finality.
 
The Court's review of COA decisions sought through a Rule 64 petition is limited to acts of grave abuse amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction alleged to have been committed by the COA Proper.
[43]
Petitioners insist that the COA Proper gravely abused its discretion when it gave due course to the motion for reconsideration of the 
Original COA Proper Decision
 despite being filed 
beyond the reglementary period to appeal/intervene and by individuals not parties to the case
.
[44]
Notably, only the 
BMHI Board and officials-approvers/certifiers
 moved for reconsideration of the 
Original COA Proper Decision
. Herein petitioners no longer assailed the ruling for the obvious reason that they, the payees, were already absolved from liability. However, in resolving the motion, the COA Proper reversed itself and reinstated the payees/petitioners' liability to return the amounts they received.
Petitioners submit that an aggrieved party has six months 
from receipt of the Director's Decision to appeal the same to the COA Proper
.
[45]
 Should the party opt to further assail the COA Proper's decision, he must move for reconsideration within the remainder of the original six-month period to appeal.
[46]
 Having been filed outside the appeal period, the COA had no jurisdiction to entertain the BMHI Board and officials' motion.
The Court agrees with the petitioners. However, after a judicious review of the antecedent facts, the Court finds that even the petitioners' appeal to the COA Proper was belated.
Verily, petitioners refer to the 
six-month reglementary period of appeal
 in disallowance cases,
[47]
 as prescribed in Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code.
[48]
 However, their interpretation of the rule is erroneous.
The Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA (COA Rules)
[49]
 allows an aggrieved party to appeal a notice of disallowance to the 
Director
 having jurisdiction over the government agency audited
[50]
 within six months from receipt thereof.
[51]
 Thereafter, the Director's ruling
[52]
 may be appealed to the COA Proper for review 
within the time remaining from the original six-month reglementary period
.
[53]
In other words, the six-month period shall be reckoned from the time the aggrieved party received the notice of disallowance. A timely appeal to the Director merely tolls the running of this period.
[54]
 After which, 
the aggrieved party only has the remainder of that same period to further elevate the case to the COA Proper
.
In the present case, petitioners received a copy of ND No. BMHI-04-002-(03) on November 12, 2004.
[55]
 Based on the 
rollo
, they waited until May 12, 2005
[56]
 or the very last day to appeal to the Director. In doing so, they completely exhausted the original six-month reglementary period.
[57]
Subsequently, petitioners received on March 19, 2008
[58]
 the Director's Decision No. 2008-011, which upheld the disallowance and payees' liability therefor. Given that they already took exactly six months prior to appeal 
to
 the Director, a timely appeal 
from
 the Director's ruling (LAO-C Decision No. 2008-011) should have been filed no later than March 19, 2008 or the same day they were notified of the adverse decision. 
However, petitioners mistakenly believed that they had another six months to appeal therefrom.
[59]
 Thus, they filed their appeal
[60]
 before the COA Proper on September 19, 2008, the last day of the supposed fresh period.
[61]
Certainly, petitioners' erroneous interpretation of the rules was fatal.
 Without a timely/perfected appeal to the COA Proper, the Director's ruling lapsed into finality
[62]
 on March 19, 2008. To recall, the Director disallowed the payment of AGCs and held the 
payees, approver
 (Puno), and 
certifiers
 (Tanagon and Nocos) 
liable
 therefor. In view of the foregoing, this ruling already attained finality.
It is well-settled that a final and executory decision is immutable or unappealable.
[63]
 In which case, an appellate tribunal such as the COA Proper generally does not have jurisdiction to further entertain any appeal, much less alter or modify, the lower body (Director)'s ruling. Guided by these principles, 
the Directors 
final
 decision may no longer be disturbed
.
At any rate, even if the Court brushes aside the petitioners' procedural lapse, their fate remains the same.
The disallowance and ruling on the liability therefor are supported by law and jurisprudence.
 
In the assailed issuances, the COA Proper ultimately affirmed the Director's ruling: (a) disallowing the payment of AGCs; and (b) finding the payees, approver, and certifiers liable.
Apart from its, final and executory character, the Court also finds no reason to deviate from the findings and conclusions of the COA, inasmuch as these are based on applicable law and jurisprudence.
a) The disallowance is proper because the payment of AGCs lacks legal basis and requisite board approval.
 
The fundamental principles governing government financial transactions
[64]
 require all public disbursements to be founded on a specific statute
[65]
 and to bear the approval of the proper officials.
[66]
 Otherwise, these payments shall be considered as illegal.
A closer look at the subject transaction reveals that the payment of AGCs was 
not founded on any specific law
 authorizing its grant/release. It is undisputed that BMHI paid the subject AGCs solely based on 
BCDA Board Resolution No. 2003-09-186
, which was passed by the Board of its 
parent company
, not its own.
Verily, the law considers a corporate act valid and effective only if it bears the board's seal of approval, which is ordinarily evidenced by a resolution passed by the board acting as a body
[67]
 and in accordance with the formalities required by the corporate by-laws.
However, the formal approval of corporate powers must be understood to be specific to a corporation's own board.
[68]
 A corporate act's validity cannot be made to rely on a resolution passed by the board of another entity, even that of its 
parent company
, because the authority to approve corporate transactions is purely personal to a corporation's own board. To be sure, a parent company's board resolution authorizing the payment of benefits will not automatically redound to its subsidiaries. The directive shall be ineffectual as to the subsidiary unless the subsidiary's own board separately convenes and approves it.
Certainly, 
without an express statutory grant and/or a specific board resolution approving its payment
, the release of AGCs contravenes the law and must be disallowed.
b) The finding of liability conforms with the law and jurisprudence.
 
A person's liability for unlawful expenditures hinges upon the extent of his participation in the disallowed transaction.
[69]
Payees
 shall bliable to refund the disallowed amount, regardless of good faith and passive receipt thereof.
[70]
 The disbursement of AGCs, having adjudged to be unlawful, is considered to have been paid in error or through mistake.
[71]
 Thus, herein petitioners/payees' liability "is a civil obligation to which fundamental civil law principles, such as unjust enrichment and '
solutio indebiti
' apply."
[72]
 Unless there are "
bona fide
 exceptions manifest on the record, the Court shall remain stringent in appreciating the defense of good faith when determining a 
payee's
 liability over disallowed expenses."
[73]
On the other hand, 
approvers
, as public officers, are presumed to have acted in the regular performance of their duties and in good faith.
[74]
 Thus, they shall not answer for the disallowed amount, unless it is shown that they are guilty bad faith or malice.
[75]
In the present case, Puno 
approved
 DV Nos. 2003-09-130 and 2003-09-131, allowing the payment of AGCs. For their part, Tanagon and Nocos did not merely certify that funds were available for the subject disbursement. They attested that it was 
necessary/valid/proper
 and 
supported by complete documentation
. That these personnel affixed their signatures on the DVs despite 
the clear absence of a BMHI board resolution authorizing the expense
 disputes good faith and regular performance of their respective duties.
Based on these considerations, the finding of liability against the 
payees and BMHI approving/certifying personnel
 is also proper.
WHEREFORE
, the Commission on Audit Commission Proper Decision No. 2010-116 dated November 15, 2010 and the Resolution dated September 27, 2013 are 
SET ASIDE
. The Commission on Audit Legal and Adjudication Office-Corporate Decision No. 2008-011 dated March 4, 2008 is 
AFFIRMED
, holding Isaac S. Puno III, as approving officer, and Rowena B. Tanagon and Glorificacion M. Nocos, as certifying officers, solidarily liable for the return of the disallowed amounts. Meanwhile, petitioners, as payees, are individually liable for the return of the disallowed amounts they respectively received.
