DELOS SANTOS, J.:


The Case


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking the reversal and setting aside of the Decision
[2]
 dated April 3, 2018 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated December 6, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 04930. The assailed Decision affirmed the Order
[4]

 dated February 21, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lapu-Lapu 
City, Branch 27, which dismissed Civil Case No. 6837-L, a case for 
Declaration of Trust and Reconveyance filed by Benson Chua (petitioner),
 on the ground of failure to pay the required docket fees.


Antecedents


Petitioner alleged that sometime in 1991, he decided to buy two (2) 
parcels of land, but because his marriage was shaky, he requested 
respondent Philip L. Go (Philip), his cousin, that the title to the said
 properties will be placed under the latter's name in trust for him. 
According to petitioner, when he eventually demanded the transfer of the
 title to the two (2) properties to him, Philip and his wife, Diana G. 
Go (collectively, respondents), refused. Thus, on July 12, 2007, 
petitioner filed the Complaint
[5]
 for Declaration of Trust and Reconveyance against respondents, docketed as Civil Case No. 6837-L. 

In their Verified Answer,
[6]
 
respondents interposed their affirmative defenses and counterclaims, and
 prayed for a preliminary hearing as if a motion to dismiss was filed 
under Section 6 (1), Rule 17 of the Revised Rules of Court. After 
respondents presented their evidence in support of their defenses, the 
RTC dismissed petitioner's complaint for utter lack of merit and 
confirmed the titles to the properties in the name of respondents.
[7]


Feeling aggrieved, petitioner filed an appeal before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 02997. In a Decision
[8]

 promulgated on July 30, 2010, the CA reversed and set aside the 
aforementioned dismissal and remanded the case to the RTC for further 
proceedings.

When the case was remanded to the RTC, respondents filed several motions
 pertaining to petitioner's payment of docket fees.


First
, an 
Ex-Parte
 Motion
[9]

 filed on July 18, 2012, asking for an order that will direct the Office
 of the Clerk (OCC) of the RTC of Lapu Lapu City to furnish the trial 
court with certified true copies of the official receipts for the total 
docket fees paid by petitioner. Meanwhile, on August 9, 2012, the OCC 
issued a certificate stating that petitioner paid the amount of 
P111,157.60 as docket fees.
[10]


Second
, a Manifestation and Motion
[11]

 filed on August 23, 2012, asking the court to direct the OCC to issue a
 certified copy of a reÂ­assessment/re-computation of the correct docket 
fees. Consequently, the trial court issued an Order
[12]

 granting the motion. 

Subsequently, during the hearing held on October 25, 2012, the trial 
court observed that the OCC have submitted two (2) certifications 
stating different amounts paid by petitioner, to wit: (1) a certificate 
dated August 9, 2012 indicating P111,157.60; and (2) a second 
certificate dated September 20, 2012 stating the amount of P202,993.00. 
Thus, the trial court issued an Order
[13]

 directing the OCC to explain the difference in the amounts.


In compliance to the trial court's order, Atty. Rey Ciriaco Ponce (Atty.
 Ponce), Clerk of Court, OCC Lapu-Lapu City, wrote a Letter
[14]

 dated November 12, 2012 explaining that the second certification 
stating the amount of P202,993.00 is a re-assessment/re-computation of 
the amount that should have been paid by petitioner. It was further 
clarified that the amount paid was really P111,157.60. As to the 
difference on the assessed amounts (P202,993.00 and P111,157.60), it was
 explained that it was due to the fact that the original complaint did 
not specify the exact location of the property nor did it mention the 
exact zonal valuation. When the cash clerk made the initial assessment, 
the computation for the docket fee was based on P345.00 per square meter
 Bureau of Internal Revenue zonal valuation, which should have been 
P650.00 per square meter, thus, the difference in the amount of 
P91,835.40.
[15]
 


Lastly
, respondents filed an Urgent 
Ex-Parte
 Motion
[16]

 on November 26, 2012, praying that: (1) the re-assessment by Atty. 
Ponce be rejected; and (2) petitioner be ordered to pay, before the next
 hearing on December 7, 2012, the total amount of P346,470.40 in 
accordance to the first assessment by the cash clerk on August 2, 2012, 
which was based on the lowest zonal value of P1,125.00 per square meter.

On December 7, 2012, the trial court in the presence of petitioner's 
counsel, Atty. Manuel Zosa III (Atty. Zosa), gave an order in open 
court, which directed petitioner to pay the deficiency in the docket 
fees in the amount of P91,735.40 within 10 days from receipt of the 
order. The trial court ruled that said valuation has no basis and that 
Atty. Ponce's assessment must prevail.
[17]
 

Thereafter, the trial court furnished petitioner with copies of the Order
[18]

 at his two (2) addresses appearing on the records. However, the copies 
for petitioner were returned unserved with the postal carrier's notation
 "RTS (Return to Sender)-moved."
[19]


Petitioner failed to pay the deficiency as ordered by the court.


Ruling of the RTC


On February 21, 2013, the trial court issued an Order
[20]
 dismissing the case for failure of petitioner to pay the required docket fees. The dispositive portion reads:


Wherefore, for failure of the plaintiff to pay the required legal fees, this case is hereby ordered DISMISSED.
 
SO ORDERED.
[21]


On March 20, 2013, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[22]

 (MR) arguing that the period of 10 days to pay the deficiency in the 
docket fees never started to run because Atty. Zosa never received a 
copy of the Order issued on December 7, 2012. According to petitioner, 
even if the trial court attempted to furnish him of the copy of the said
 order at his two (2) addresses, the same was not valid because he is 
represented by counsel. Moreover, petitioner claimed that the amount of 
P91,735.40 was not the correct amount because Atty. Ponce based the 
computation on the zonal value of P650.00 per square meter. Petitioner 
explained that there are two (2) lots involved which are in different 
locations, thus, he claimed that there is a need to make a 
re-computation of the docket fees based on the correct zonal value of 
the subject lots.
[23]


In an Order
[24]
 dated July 1, 
2013, the trial court denied petitioner's MR. The trial court maintained
 that the service of an Order dated December 7, 2012 is valid and 
binding. The trial court explained that since the said order clearly 
directed petitioner himself to pay the docket fees, service upon him was
 really intended to ensure his receipt of the same and not to his 
counsel, Atty. Zosa, who appeared during the hearing and did not even 
manifest any intention to file a motion for reconsideration on the 
computation of the docket fees. As regards petitioner's dissent on the 
basis of the computation, the trial court sustained the OCC's 
computation since it is the office designated to determine the same. It 
was noted that instead of signifying his intention to pay the deficiency
 in the docket fees, petitioner opted to ask for re-computation, which 
the trial court deemed to be unviable at that stage of the proceeding.
[25]


Petitioner went to the CA to appeal the RTC's dismissal of the case.


The Ruling of the CA


In a Decision
[26]
 promulgated on April 3, 2018, the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit. Applying the ruling enunciated in 
Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals
,
[27]

 the CA ruled that the RTC's jurisdiction over the case had yet to 
properly attach. According to the CA, despite the directive of the RTC 
to pay the correct docket fees, petitioner did not only fail to pay but 
also clearly evaded payment by challenging Atty. Ponce's assessment or 
computation. The CA noted that in both petitioner's MR before the RTC 
and appeal to the CA, he did not signify his intention to pay the 
assessed deficiency in the docket fees.
[28]
 
Moreover, the CA rejected petitioner's claim that the period of 10 days 
within which to pay the deficiency in the docket fees did not run 
because his counsel did not receive a copy of the RTC's order. It was 
pointed out that: (1) even if petitioner was represented by counsel, the
 service of the said order personally to him remains valid considering 
that the RTC specifically directed that the same should be furnished to 
him; (2) the copy of the order was properly sent to his addresses 
appearing on the records; and (3) it was petitioner who, without 
justifiable reason, failed to notify the trial court of his change of 
address.
[29]
 

It was further emphasized that Atty. Zosa, who was duly notified in open
 court of the order of the RTC, has the duty to inform petitioner 
regarding the directive to pay the deficiency in the docket fees. The CA
 held that Atty. Zosa's negligence in not informing petitioner binds the
 latter. Thus, petitioner cannot now be permitted to hide behind the 
flimsy excuse that no written notice was received by his counsel as the 
latter cannot feign ignorance of the existence of the order
.
[30]


On May 8, 2018, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration,
[31]
 which was denied for lack of merit by the CA in its Resolution
[32]
 dated December 6, 2018. 
Issues


The issues submitted for the Court's resolution are:


(1) Whether or not the CA erred in affirming the RTC even if petitioner 
paid the deficiency in the docket fees while the case was pending before
 the CA; and 

(2) Whether or not the CA erred in affirming the order of the RTC even 
if neither petitioner nor his counsel received a copy of the order 
directing petitioner to pay the deficiency in the docket fees.
[33]


Prefatorily, petitioner claimed that he consistently manifested his 
willingness to pay the correct deficiency in the docket fees. He also 
pointed out that he already paid for the deficiency in the docket fees 
during the pendency of his appeal before the CA.
[34]


Petitioner alleged that the CA should have applied the ruling of this Court in the case of 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr. v. Court of Appeals
,
[35]

 wherein it was held that the court may allow payment of the deficiency 
in the docket fees within a reasonable period of time instead of 
dismissing the case. According to petitioner, he never defrauded the 
Court in the payment of the docket fees as he merely relied on the 
assessment done by the clerk of court when he filed the case.
[36]


In their Comment/Opposition,
[37]
 respondents countered that petitioner's reliance in 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr.
 was misplaced since the factual 
milieu

 of said case is different from the instant case, such that, the issue 
of incomplete payment of the docket fees was never raised in the trial 
court. Respondents claimed that petitioner's payment of the full amount 
of the docket fees was already too late, as it was done when the case 
was already on appeal and after the CA had already rendered an 
unfavorable judgment against him.
[38]


Respondents highlighted that petitioner did not demonstrate his 
willingness to abide by the rules by paying the required additional 
docket fees. They believed that petitioner must not be allowed to hide 
behind the excuse that no written and signed copy of the Order dated 
December 7, 2012 was sent to his counsel.
[39]


In his Reply,
[40]
 petitioner 
emphasized that the deficiency in the amount of P91,735.40 was already 
paid and that he had no intention to defraud the government. He 
reiterated that he was not able to timely pay the said deficiency 
because they did not receive the Order of the RTC dated December 7, 2012
 and he was still praying for a re-computation of the docket fees by the
 OCC.
[41]


Our Ruling


The RTC was able to acquire jurisdiction.
 

In 
Manchester
, the Court explicitly pronounced that "[t]he court 
acquires jurisdiction over any case only upon the payment of the 
prescribed docket fee."
[42]
 Hence, the payment of docket fees is not only mandatory, but also jurisdictional. 
The above-ruling was later modified in 
Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion
,
[43]

 wherein the Court ruled that where the filing of the initiatory 
pleading is not accompanied by payment of the docket fee, the court may 
allow payment of the fee within a reasonable time but in no case beyond 
the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period 
[44]


Moreover, the Court ruled in 
Rivera v. Del Rosario
:
[45]


If the amount of docket fees paid is insufficient 
considering the amount of the claim, the clerk of court of the lower 
court involved or his duly authorized deputy has the responsibility of 
making a deficiency assessment. The party filing the case will be 
required to pay the deficiency, but jurisdiction is not automatically 
lost.
[46]


In 
Ramones v. Spouses Guimoc
,
[47]
 the Court explained:


[P]revailing case law demonstrates that non-payment of the 
prescribed filing fees at the time of the filing of the complaint or 
other initiatory pleading fails to vest jurisdiction over the case in 
the trial court. 
Yet, where the plaintiff has paid the amount of filing fees 
assessed by the clerk of court
,
 and the amount paid turns out to be deficient, the trial court still 
acquires jurisdiction over the case, subject to the payment by the 
plaintiff of the deficiency assessment
. The reason is that to 
penalize the party for the omission of the clerk of court is not fair if
 the party has acted in good faith.
[48]
 (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)


Applying the foregoing principles in the instant case, the Court does 
not agree with the CA that the RTC never acquired jurisdiction in the 
case. It is undisputed that petitioner had paid the amount of 
P111,157.60 as docket fees, which was based on the initial assessment of
 the OCC. Corollarily, while the payment turned out to be deficient, the
 jurisdiction of the RTC have already attached when the amount of 
P111,157.60 was paid by petitioner. 


The RTC's dismissal was proper.
 
While the Court rules that the RTC acquired jurisdiction over 
petitioner's complaint notwithstanding the deficiency in the docket 
fees, 
We
 find that the consequent dismissal of the case was proper.


In 
Emnace v. Court of Appeals
,
[49]

 the Court reiterated that the liberal application of the rule allows 
the plaintiff to pay the proper docket fees within a reasonable time 
before the expiration of the applicable prescriptive or reglementary 
period.
[50]
 Accordingly, the 
trial court should determine the proper docket fee based on the 
estimated amount being sought to be collected and direct for it to be 
paid within reasonable time, provided the applicable prescriptive period
 or reglementary period has not yet expired. Failure to comply 
therewith, and upon motion by petitioner, the immediate dismissal of the
 complaint shall issue on jurisdictional grounds.
[51]


In this case, respondents were able to timely raise their issues as 
regards petitioner's payment of the docket fees. The Court notes that 
respondents also prayed for the dismissal of the case in case petitioner
 fails to pay the correct docket fees. 

However, in conformity with 
Sun Insurance
,
[52]

 the RTC did not dismiss the case outright, but instead, asked the OCC 
for clarification, and for re-computation and re-assessment of the 
docket fees. Corollarily, the trial court granted petitioner the time to
 pay his deficiency after the OCC determined the correct docket fees. 
Despite the apparent liberality of the trial court, petitioner still 
failed to pay. 
Accordingly, the RTC cannot be said to have whimsically or capriciously 
dismissed the case.


In praying for the Court's liberality to reverse the ruling of the CA 
that affirmed the dismissal of the RTC, petitioner invokes that: (1) the
 deficiency in the docket fees has already been paid; (2) he 
consistently manifested willingness to pay the deficiency; (3) the CA 
should have applied the ruling in 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr.
; and (4) his counsel did not receive the order of the trial court directing him to pay the said deficiency. 
After a careful review of the records, petitioner's invocation for the Court's liberality must fail.


Negligence of the lawyer binds
petitioner.
 

Petitioner claims that the attempt of the RTC to furnish him of the 
order was not valid because he was represented by a counsel. Further, 
petitioner argues that the period of 10 days given by the RTC within 
which to pay the P91,735.40 never started to run because his counsel 
never received a copy of the Order dated December 7, 2012.

Petitioner's argument is untenable.

As a general rule, if any party has appeared by counsel, service upon 
him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon 
the party himself is ordered by the court.
[53]


Accordingly, petitioner cannot fault the RTC in sending him the copies 
of the Order dated December 7, 2012, the dispositive portion of which 
reads:


WHEREFORE,
 plaintiff is hereby directed to pay the deficiency of the legal fees in the amount of P91,735.40 pesos 
within ten (10) days from the receipt of this order.


x x x x

Atty. Zosa is notified of this order in open court.
 Furnish copy of this order to Atty. Ala.


SO ORDERED.
[54]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)


Moreover, there is no question that petitioner's counsel, Atty. Zosa, 
was able to attend the hearing on December 7, 2012. The latter was 
personally informed in open court of the RTC's order for petitioner to 
pay the deficiency in the docket fees. In this regard, it bears 
stressing that while petitioner zealously harps that Atty. Zosa should 
have received a copy of the said order, albeit court appearance, the 
former did not give any explanation why the latter failed to inform him 
of the court's order. Prudence and diligence dictate that since the 
foregoing order of the RTC was crucial to the case, Atty. Zosa should 
have immediately informed petitioner about it.

Unfortunately, it is well-settled that the negligence of the counsel 
binds the client.
[55]
 The exception is where the gross negligence of the lawyer deprived his client of due process of law,
[56]

 which was not present in this case. Oddly, the omission of petitioner 
to even allege his counsel's negligence gives the Court a clear 
impression that he is trying to shroud or disproving to deny Atty. 
Zosa's negligence in timely notifying him.


Petitioner has not shown willingness
to pay.


In the case of 
United Overseas Bank v. Ros
,
[57]
 the Court explained that:


[W]here the party does not deliberately intend to defraud 
the court in payment of docket fees, and manifests its willingness to 
abide by the rules by paying additional docket fees when required by the
 court, the liberal doctrine enunciated in 
Sun Insurance
, and not the strict regulations set in 
Manchester
, will apply.
[58]


Notwithstanding the ruling in 
Sun Insurance
, it must be 
emphasized that payment of filing fees in full at the time the 
initiatory pleading or application is filed is still the general rule. 
Exceptions that grant liberality for insufficient payment are strictly 
construed against the filing party.
[59]


In this case, petitioner faults the CA for not applying United Overseas 
Bank and further alleged that he consistently manifested in his brief 
and reply brief that he was willing to pay the correct deficiency in the
 docket fees.

After a review of the records, the Court agrees with the CA that 
petitioner's willingness to pay the deficiency was wanting. While he 
claims that he was awaiting to find out if the OCC made the correct 
computation of the docket fees, nowhere in any of petitioner's pleadings
 filed before any court did he manifest his willingness, to the RTC or 
to the CA, that he will be paying additional docket fees when required. 
As aptly observed by the CA:


In this case, the appellant not only failed to pay the 
correct docket fees corresponding to his Complaint but also clearly 
evaded its payment by challenging Atty. Ponce's assessment or 
computation of his correct filing fees and by his failure to heed the 
court [
a quo
]'s Order dated 07 December 2012. Notably, appellant omitted to mention in his Motion for Reconsideration before the court 
a quo

 that he intended to pay the correct docket fees. Even in this appeal, 
appellant has not signified his intention to pay the assessed deficiency
 in the court fees.
[60]


Relatedly, it is significant to note that petitioner paid to the OCC the
 subject deficiency only on May 7, 2018, which was only after the 
receipt of the CA's adverse decision in CA-G.R. CVNo. 04930.

To 
Our
 mind, considering that the matter pertaining to the 
payment of the correct docket fees has been an issue since the start of 
the trial, and that he already failed to pay the subject deficiency as 
ordered by the RTC, petitioner should have been more judicious in 
signifying his willingness to pay, starting from his motion for 
reconsideration before the trial court.


Heirs of Reinoso, Sr. not applicable.
 

Petitioner argued that the CA should have applied 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr.
,
 wherein it was held that the court may allow payment for the deficiency
 within a reasonable period of time instead of dismissing the case. 
The Court agrees with the CA that petitioner's reliance in 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr
. is misplaced. Indeed, the factual 
milieu
 of the said case differs from the instant case. 
Foremost, in 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr.
, petitioners raised the principal issue of whether the CA misapplied the ruling in 
Manchester
.
 The Court sustained petitioners' argument and applied the liberal 
interpretation of the rule in payment of the docket fees, after taking 
into account that the case was filed before the 
Manchester
 ruling came out. In this case, aside from the fact that this case was filed after the 
Manchester
 ruling came out, petitioner never directly raised the 
Manchester

 ruling as an issue. 

Moreover, the deficiency in the docket fees raised in this case was 
consistently raised before the RTC, and then, was brought on appeal 
before the CA.  On the other hand, it must be noted that in 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr.
,
 the matter of failure to pay the correct docket fees was never an issue
 before the RTC, and it was the CA which dismissed the case for the said
 reason.


Concomitantly, it must be noted that the instant case was not dismissed 
outright by the RTC. It bears stressing that the dismissal came only 
after the deficiency was clarified and upon failure of petitioner to 
unjustifiably pay the same. In fact, in 
Heirs of Reinoso, Sr.
, 
there was outright dismissal on the ground of non-payment of docket fees
 and prescription. 
At any rate, the Court finds that petitioner was sufficiently and timely
 accorded the liberality he is praying for during the trial. Again, it 
bears stressing that the trial court acted judiciously, such that: (1) 
it did not dismiss the case outright; (2) it gave petitioner the chance 
to pay; (3) it sent notices to his addresses indicated in the records; 
and (4) it waited for the returns of the proof of service to petitioner.
 Unfortunately, petitioner has to bear the fateful outcome of his case 
due to the negligence of his counsel and for being unmindful of 
informing the trial court of his change in address.


All things considered, the Court holds that petitioner failed to show 
grave error on the part of the CA in affirming the RTC's dismissal of 
the instant case.


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, this Court resolves to 
DENY

 the petition. The Decision dated April 3, 2018 and the Resolution dated
 December 6, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 04930 are 
hereby 
AFFIRMED.
