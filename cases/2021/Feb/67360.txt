THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 239505, February 17, 2021 ]


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. ROGELIO B. CIRUELAS,* REPRESENTED BY HIS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, DOMINADOR B. CIRUELAS, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




DELOS SANTOS, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision
[2]
 dated December 1, 2017 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated May 22, 2018 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV 
No. 104582. The CA upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Amended 
Decision
[4]
 to issue a new 
Certificate of Title in the name of respondent Rogelio B. Ciruelas 
(Rogelio) and in the same proceeding, authorized the correction of his 
surname on the title from Ceruelas to Ciruelas. 
The Facts


Rogelio and Dominador B. Ciruelas (Dominador) are brothers. The instant controversy arose from a 
Petition
 for the Issuance of a New Owner's Duplicate Copy of Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. T-62328 Registered in the name of Rogelio 
Ceruelas and Correction in the Family Name of the Registered Owner from 
Ceruelas to Ciruelas and on file in the Register of Deeds [of] Batangas 
Province
 filed by Dominador, as Rogelio's attorney-in-fact.
[5]


Rogelio executed an Affidavit of Loss
[6]

 stating, that: (a) he was the registered owner of a parcel of land 
situated in Bayorbor, Mataas na Kahoy, Batangas, covered under Transfer 
Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-62328;
[7]
(b)
 he kept his owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328 inside a cabinet 
in his bedroom at his residence; and (c) despite diligent and exhaustive
 efforts, said owner's duplicate copy could not be located and thus, 
deemed lost and beyond recovery. A Certification was issued by the 
Register of Deeds of Batangas Province certifying that a copy of TCT No.
 T-62328 registered under the name of Rogelio Ceruelas is intact and 
existing in their files,
[8]
 The Affidavit of Loss was submitted to the Registry of Deeds of Batangas and annotated on the title.
[9]


The petition prayed for the following reliefs: (a) that the owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328 be declared null and void; (b) an 
order be issued directing the Registry of Deeds of Batangas Province to 
issue a new owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328 in the name of the
 registered owner; and (c) to amend his surname from Ceruelas to 
Ciruelas.
[10]


As there was no opposition to the petition, Dominador presented his evidence 
ex parte
.
 Dominador testified as to the circumstances relating to the loss of the
 owner's duplicate copy and how his brother's family name was 
inadvertently misspelled as "Ceruelas" when their true and correct 
family name is Ciruelas.
[11]
 
Likewise submitted into evidence was the Special Power of Attorney (SPA)
 issued by Rogelio designating Dominador to appear on his behalf
[12]
 and documentary evidence to establish the requisite jurisdictional facts.


The RTC Ruling


On March 28, 2014, the RTC rendered a Decision
[13]
 granting the petition. The court found no reason to doubt the claim that the owner's duplicate copy of TCTNo. T-62328 was lost.

The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) sought reconsideration, which was denied in an Order
[14]

 dated September 30, 2014. In the same Order, the RTC granted the Motion
 for Clarification filed by Dominador which sought to amend the 
dispositive portion of the RTC Decision to include the matter of 
correcting Rogelio's surname.
[15]


Considering that the RTC Decision had not yet attained finality and the 
matter of the correct spelling of Rogelio's surname was discussed in the
 body of the said Decision, the RTC rendered an Amended Decision.
[16]
 Thus, the dispositive portion of the RTC Decision was amended as follows:


WHEREFORE, the foregoing petition is hereby GRANTED. 
Accordingly, the lost owner's duplicate copy of Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. T-62328 is hereby cancelled; and the Register of Deeds for the
 Province of Batangas is hereby ordered to issue a new owner's copy of 
the title which shall bear the annotation that the same is issued in 
lieu of the lost one; and that it shall in all respects be entitled to 
like faith and credit as the original copy of TCT No. T-62328 on file 
with the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Batangas, and shall be 
regarded as such for the purposes of Presidential Decree No. 1529 
(Property Registration Decree), as amended.


Likewise, the Register of Deeds is hereby directed to cause the 
correction of the petitioner's family name as registered owner in TCT 
No. T-62328 from CERUELAS to 
CIRUELAS
 such that his full name shall 
appear therein as ROGELIO B. CIRUELAS
.


SO ORDERED.
[17]


The CA Ruling


On December 1, 2017, the CA rendered the assailed Decision
[18]

 dismissing the appeal. In so ruling, the CA held: (1) the registration 
of the SPA in favor of Dominador is neither a prerequisite for its 
validity nor will its non-registration render an agent's authority 
invalid;
[19]
 (2) sufficient evidence was adduced to warrant a reconstitution of TCT No. T-62328 which was lost;
[20]

 and (3) while an action for judicial reconstitution under Section 109 
of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529, otherwise known as the "Property
 Registration Decree," should be resolved ahead of an action to amend 
under Section 108 of the same law, to split the proceedings at this 
juncture would result in multiplicity of suits, duplicitous procedure 
and cause unnecessary delay.
[21]


Dissatisfied, the OSG sought reconsideration.

On May 22, 2018, the CA rendered the assailed Resolution
[22]

 denying the Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit.

Hence, this Petition.

The Republic (petitioner), through the OSG, maintains that Dominador had
 no authority to either institute the action on behalf of Rogelio or 
sign the Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping because 
the SPA was not registered with the Register of Deeds as mandated by 
Section 64 of P.D. No. 1529.
[23]

 Further, the evidence presented by Dominador could not prove the fact 
of loss of the owner's duplicate copy insofar as the Affidavit of Loss 
executed by Rogelio was hearsay and Dominador had no personal knowledge 
as to the circumstances relating to the safekeeping and eventual loss of
 the owner's duplicate copy.
[24]

 Finally, the OSG insists that it was improper for the appellate court 
to allow the correction of Rogelio's surname in the same action for 
re-issuance of a lost duplicate title in contravention of the express 
mandate of Section 108 of P.D. No. 1529.
[25]


In his Comment,
[26]
 Dominador 
avers that the arguments raised by the OSG have been previously 
considered and passed upon by both the RTC and the CA. More importantly,
 the OSG raises questions of fact which are beyond the jurisdiction of 
the Court. He claims that the OSG failed to state circumstances showing 
lack or excess of jurisdiction amounting to grave abuse of discretion as
 required under Rule 65. Finally, contrary to the assertions of the OSG,
 he has personal knowledge as to the circumstances relating to the loss 
of Rogelio's owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328 because they are 
both single, reside in the same house, and share the bedroom where said 
copy was kept and subsequently lost.

In Reply,
[27]
 the OSG points out that the instant petition is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court and not a Petition for 
Certiorari

 under Rule 65 and hence, there is no need to allege grave abuse of 
discretion. Further, the OSG denies that the petition raised questions 
of fact as the issues raised delve in to the proper application of law 
of procedure, specifically: the authority of the initiating party, the 
competence of the witness, and the propriety of the action before the 
RTC.


The Issues


To finally put an end to this controversy, the following issues must be 
resolved: (1) whether Dominador, as attorney-in-fact, had the authority 
to file a petition for new owner's duplicate on behalf of Rogelio and 
execute the Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping; (2) 
whether the fact of loss of the owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-62328 was
 established; and (3) whether a certificate of title may be altered 
through a proceeding other than Section 108 of P.D. No. 1529.


The Court's Ruling


The petition is meritorious.

While Dominador had the authority to initiate the petition under Section
 109 of P.D. No. 1529 and to execute the Verification and Certification 
against Forum Shopping, the Court finds that the evidence presented by 
Rogelio, through Dominador, failed to prove the fact of loss as to 
warrant the issuance of a new owner's duplicate. 


Dominador had the requisite 
authority to file the petition 
and
execute the Verification 
and
Certification against 
Forum
Shopping.


Rogelio is the registered owner of TCT No. T-62328 and thus, is the real
 party-in-interest, who should initiate an action under Section 109 of 
P.D. No. 1529 before the RTC. However, by virtue of the SPA executed by 
Rogelio in favor of Dominador, a contract of agency was created between 
them with Rogelio as the principal and Dominador as the agent. In a 
contract of agency, the agent binds himself to represent another, the 
principal, with the latter's consent or authority.
[28]

 An agency is based on representation, where the agent acts for and in 
behalf of the principal on matters within the scope of the authority 
conferred upon him such that, the acts have the same legal effect as if 
they were personally done by the principal himself.
[29]

 By this legal fiction of representation, the actual or legal absence of
 the principal is converted into his legal or juridical presence.
[30]


Petitioner makes much of the fact that the SPA conferring authority to 
Dominador was not registered with the Registry of Deeds of Batangas and,
 thus, in violation of Section 64 of P.D. No. 1529 which states:


SEC. 64. 
Power of attorney
. Any person may, by power 
of attorney, convey or otherwise deal with registered land and the same 
shall be registered with the Register of Deeds of the province or city 
where the land lies. Any instrument revoking such power of attorney 
shall be registered in like manner.


A plain reading of the aforementioned provision, however, does not state
 that the registration of an SPA is a prerequisite to its validity or 
conversely, its non-registration makes the agent's authority 
ineffective. The Court agrees with the rationalization of the appellate 
court that the main purpose of registration is to notify the whole world
 and ultimately, to protect the rights of any third person who may have 
interests or claims over the land.
[31]
 Records show that the 
Petition
 for the Issuance of a New Owner's Duplicate Copy of TCT No. T-62328 
Registered in the name of Rogelio Ceruelas and Correction in the Family 
Name of the Registered Owner from Ceruelas to Ciruelas and on file in 
the Register of Deeds for Batangas Province
 was published once a 
week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation, 
was set for hearing and announced to the public, with no person 
interposing any objections. As the purpose of registration of the SPA 
was accomplished, the Court finds no reason to invalidate Dominador's 
authority on this ground alone.
[32]


Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court provides that the certification 
against forum shopping must be executed by the plaintiff or principal 
party. The reason for this is that the principal party has actual 
knowledge whether a petition has previously been filed involving the 
same case or substantially the same issues. If, for any reason, the 
principal party cannot sign the petition, the one signing on his behalf 
must have been duly authorized.
[33]


On the argument that it should have been Rogelio who executed the 
Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping; records show that
 the SPA executed by Rogelio authorized Dominador to sign the same as it
 expressly clothes the latter authority 
"to sign and execute any and 
all documents relative thereto and to attend hearings so required and to
 do such other acts necessary for the accomplishment of the foregoing 
objective"
[34]
 and such 
authority is broad enough to include the execution of a Verification and
 Certification against Forum Shopping. More importantly, the Court in 
the case of 
Heirs of Josefina Gabriel v. Cebrero
[35]

 has upheld the authority of an agent to execute a Verification and 
Certification against Forum Shopping when he was constituted precisely 
to prosecute a suit on behalf of his principal, thus:


It was held that when an SPA was constituted precisely to
 authorize the agent to file and prosecute suits on behalf of the 
principal, then it is such agent who has actual and personal knowledge 
whether he or she has initiated similar actions or proceedings before 
various courts on the same issue on the principal's behalf, thus, 
satisfying the requirements for a valid certification against forum 
shopping.
 The rationale behind the rule that it must be the 
"petitioner or principal party himself' who should sign such 
certification does not apply. Thus, the rule on the certification 
against forum shopping has been properly complied with when it is the 
agent or attorney-in-fact who initiated the action on the principal's 
behalf and who signed the certification against forum shopping.
[36]
 (Underscoring supplied)


The fact of loss of TCT No. T-62328
was not sufficiently proven.


In the assailed Decision, the appellate court held that in a petition 
for the issuance of a second owner's duplicate copy of a certificate of 
title in replacement of a lost one, the only questions to be resolved 
are: (1) whether or not the original owner's duplicate copy has indeed 
been lost, and (2) whether the petitioner seeking the issuance of a new 
owner's duplicate title is the registered owner or other person in 
interest. Thus, the appellate court ruled:


Under Section 109 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, the owner
 must file with the proper Registry of Deeds a notice of loss executed 
under oath. In this case, Rogelio executed an Affidavit of Loss on 
October 9, 2013 claiming loss of TCT No. T-62328. He had it annotated 
under Entry No. 564092 on October 24, 2013 with the Registry of Deeds 
for Batangas Province. On October 30, 2013, Rogelio, through Dominador, 
instituted the instant reconstitution proceedings. Undoubtedly, the 
plaintiff-appellee in this case, complied with the requirements of 
Section 109 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.

In fine, we are convinced that plaintiff-appellee adduced competent 
evidence to warrant reconstitution of the allegedly lost owner's 
duplicate certificate of title.
[37]


Erroneously, the appellate court oversimplified the procedure for 
issuance of a replacement for a lost duplicate certificate. The 
applicable law in case of loss of the owner's duplicate certificate of 
title is Section 109 of P.D. No. 1529 which provides:


SEC. 109. 
Notice and replacement of lost duplicate certificate
. In case of loss or theft of an owner's duplicate certificate of title, 
due notice under oath

 shall be sent by the owner or by someone in his behalf to the Register 
of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies as soon as the loss
 or theft is discovered. If a duplicate certificate is lost or 
destroyed, or cannot be produced by a person applying for the entry of a
 new certificate to him or for the registration of any Instrument, a 
sworn statement of the fact of such loss or destruction may be filed by 
the registered owner or other person in interest and registered.

Upon the petition of the registered owner or other person in interest, 
the court may, after 
notice and due hearing
, direct the issuance 
of a new duplicate certificate, which shall contain a memorandum of the 
fact that it is issued in place of the lost duplicate certificate, but 
shall in all respects be entitled to like faith and credit as the 
original duplicate, and shall thereafter be regarded as such for all 
purposes of this decree. (Underscoring supplied)


Section 109 of P.D. No. 1529 has two distinct requirements: the first paragraph refers to the notice requirement, 
i.e.
,
 submission of an Affidavit of Loss to the Register of Deeds while the 
second paragraph pertains to the procedure for the replacement, 
i.e.
,
 filing a petition for the issuance of a new duplicate certificate. The 
second paragraph contemplates the conduct of a full-blown hearing 
wherein petitioner must prove the fact of loss or theft through 
preponderant evidence. As applied to the instant case, mere compliance 
with the notice requirement and the filing of a petition with the 
appropriate RTC does not automatically entitle the registered owner to a
 replacement duplicate certificate. Rogelio, through Dominador, must 
still establish by preponderance of evidence that the owner's duplicate 
was lost.

In this case, the Court fmds that the fact of loss was not established 
by the required quantum of proof. To recall, the only evidence presented
 as proof of loss of Rogelio's owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328
 was Rogelio's Affidavit of Loss and Dominador's testimony. As will be 
further discussed below, both constitute hearsay evidence and cannot be 
given probative weight.

It is a basic rule in evidence that a witness can testify only on the 
facts that he knows of his own personal knowledge, i.e., those which are
 derived from his own perception.
[38]
 Otherwise, it is hearsay evidence. In 
Country Bankers Insurance Corporation v. Lianga Bay and Community MultiÂ­purpose Cooperative, Inc.
,
[39]
 the Court held:


A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of 
his personal knowledge, which means those facts which are derived from 
his perception 
Consequently, a witness may not testify as to what he 
merely learned from others either because he was told or read or heard 
the same. Such testimony is considered hearsay and may not be received 
as proof of the truth of what he has learned.
 Such is the hearsay 
rule which applies not only to oral testimony or statements but also to 
written evidence as well. (Underscoring supplied)


While Rogelio's Affidavit of Loss is considered a public document, it is
 still classified as hearsay evidence. The reason behind this 
classification is explained in the case of 
Republic v. Spouses Gimenez
:
[40]


Basic is the rule that, while affidavits may be considered 
as public documents if they are acknowledged before a notary public, 
these Affidavits are still classified as hearsay evidence. 
The reason
 for this rule is that they are not generally prepared by the affiant, 
but by another one who uses his or her own language in writing the 
affiant's statements, parts of which may thus be either omitted or 
misunderstood by the one writing them. Moreover, the adverse party is 
deprived of the opportunity to cross- examine the affiants.
 For this
 reason, affidavits are generally rejected for being hearsay, unless the
 affiants themselves are placed on the witness stand to testify thereon.
 (Underscoring supplied)


As Rogelio did not take the witness stand, he neither authenticated his 
Affidavit of Loss nor was he cross-examined. Although generally invoked 
in criminal cases, the importance of cross-examination to test the 
truthfulness of statements, as well as elicit all important facts 
bearing upon the issue from a witness, equally applies to non-criminal 
proceedings.
[41]


It is unclear whether Dominador presented himself as a witness, 
precisely to authenticate Rogelio's Affidavit of Loss. Regardless, 
Dominador's testimony
[42]
 
merely reproduced the contents of Rogelio's Affidavit. Significantly, 
there was no proof that Dominador had personal knowledge on the 
circumstances surrounding the safekeeping and subsequent loss of 
Rogelio's owner's duplicate certificate. It must be recalled that the 
personal knowledge of a witness is a substantive prerequisite for 
accepting testimonial evidence that establishes the truth of a disputed 
fact. A witness bereft of personal knowledge of the disputed fact cannot
 be called upon for that purpose because his testimony derives its value
 not from the credit accorded to him as a witness presently testifying, 
but from the veracity and competency of the extrajudicial source of his 
information.
[43]
 The Court 
notes that in his Comment, Dominador claims that he had personal 
knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the loss of the owner's 
duplicate certificate because he and Rogelio are both single, reside in 
the same house, and share the bedroom where said owner's duplicate 
certificate was kept and subsequently lost. Unfortunately, nothing on 
record supports this claim. Settled is the rule that bare allegation is 
not evidence and is not equivalent to proof.
[44]
 Worse, records show that Dominador was married
[45]
 and there was no indication that Rogelio and Dominador lived together.


In fine, the Court deems the foregoing evidence insufficient to prove the loss of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328. 

Finally, in its assailed Decision,
[46]

 the appellate court acknowledged that the nature of judicial 
reconstitution under Section 109 of P.D. No. 1529 denotes the 
reproduction of the lost or stolen title in its original form. 
Necessarily, such reconstitution should precede any action to amend or 
alter the title under Section 108, even if the purpose is just to 
correct a misspelled surname. However, for equity considerations, to 
obviate further delay, and avoid multiplicity of suits; the appellate 
court allowed the correction of Rogelio's misspelled surname from 
Ceruelas to Ciruelas in the same proceeding for replacement of owner's 
duplicate title. 

Considering, however, the Court's determination that Rogelio, through 
Dominador, failed to establish the fact of loss of the owner's duplicate
 of TCT No. T-62328 as to warrant the issuance of a replacement; the 
issue of the propriety of joining these two actions for equity 
considerations has been rendered moot.

ATTY. MARANA:


Q Mr. Witness, do you know Mr. Witness what happened to the owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT No. T-62328? 
A It was lost, sir. 
Q What was the circumstances why it was lost? 
A The title was kept in a cabinet in the bedroom of my brother, but just
 recently, he searched for the title, he failed to find it in the said 
cabinet, sir.
