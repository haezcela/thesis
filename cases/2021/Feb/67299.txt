D E C I S I O N




DELOS SANTOS, J.:


The Case
 

This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated August 16, 2017 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated January 11, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107564.


The Facts


On February 20, 2004, petitioner Gemma A. Ridao (Ridao) obtained a 
$4,000.00 loan, as evidenced by a promissory note bearing Promissory 
Note No. 2000029B,
[4]
 with 
respondent Handmade Credit and Loans, Inc. (Handmade Credit), a 
corporation engaged in the business of lending money. Ridao's 
brother-in-law, Teofilo Manipon (Teofilo), was the duly authorized 
representative of Handmade Credit.
[5]


On August 24, 2004,
[6]
 Ridao 
obtained (1) an additional loan which increased her loan obligation to 
$6,167.00, as evidenced by the same Promissory Note No. 2000029B as the 
February 20, 2004 Promissory Note
[7]
and a Statement of Loan Release;
[8]
 and (2) a P40,000.00 loan, as evidenced by another Promissory Note.
[9]
 Both loans had a 4% monthly interest and payable within a year.

For failing to pay on the due dates and despite several oral demands, Handmade Credit sent Ridao a Demand Letter
[10]

 dated September 21, 2012 for the payment of the $6,167.00 obligation 
plus monthly interest of 4%, the P40,000.00 obligation with legal 
interest, and attorney's fees. 
On July 11, 2013, having received no response, Handmade Credit filed a 
Complaint
[11]
 for collection 
of sum of money with damages against Ridao with the Regional Trial Court
 (RTC) of Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, Branch 48.

In the Complaint, Handmade Credit attached several annexes consisting of
 (1) Promissory Notes No. 2000029B dated February 20, 2004 and August 
20, 2004, (2) Statements of Loan Release dated February 20, 2004 and 
August 20, 2004, and (3) other documents relating to the loan 
transactions. Handmade Credit emphasized that Ridao had not paid a 
single centavo for her obligations. Handmade Credit prayed for the award
 of (1) actual damages in the amounts of $32,315.00 for the dollar loan 
and P209,600.00 for the peso loan, inclusive of interests; and (2) 
attorney's fees in the amount of P30,000.00, with additional appearance 
fees.
[12]


In her Answer with Special and Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaim,
[13]

 Ridao admitted that she obtained a loan from Teofilo in the amount of 
$4,000.00. However, Ridao stated that the loan was extended to her as a 
relative of the spouses Teofilo and Ingracia Manipon and not as a 
creditor of Handmade Credit. An additional amount of $300.00 was given 
to her late husband Avelino, Teofilo's brother, who received the amount 
when Ridao left for abroad.
[14]


Ridao asserted that, as of October 15, 2005, she had fully paid for her 
$4,300.00 obligation through Avelino, who tendered payments to Teofilo 
on her behalf.
[15]
 
As proof, Ridao attached Avelino's payment record consisting of a copy 
of a page of a ledger captioned "Payment for Loan @ Handmade Credit 
& Loans, Inc." Ridao stated that all payments had been duly 
acknowledged by Teofilo and his daughter Zoraida, as evidenced by the 
corresponding signatures placed beside the entries and amounts indicated
 in the ledger. The ledger

Ridao denied the additional loan which increased her obligation to 
$6,167.00, as well as the P40,000.00 loan. Ridao pointed out that the 
annexes attached by Handmade Credit in its Complaint consisting of 
promissory notes and statements of loan release were materially altered 
and the signatures were forged. Ridao stated that insertions were made 
and the dates were altered to make it appear that she entered into other
 loan transactions when she was out of the country at the time. Ridao 
insisted that the due execution and genuineness of the annexes submitted
 by Handmade Credit were questionable.
[17]


Ridao cited the special and affirmative defenses of (1) full payment, 
stating that Handmade Credit no longer has a right to collect, and (2) 
material alterations and forged signatures, which cannot be used to 
enforce payment against any party. As counterclaim, Ridao asked for the 
payment of attorney's fees in securing the services of legal counsel.
[18]
 
During the trial, Teofilo testified that Ridao executed a personal loan,
 covered by a Promissory Note dated February 20, 2004 which she signed, 
in the amount of $4,000.00. The initial amount of $1,000.00 was released
 on the same date. The remaining balance was given to Avelino in August 
2004 when Ridao was already in Israel. Also, Teofilo disclosed that an 
additional $300.00 was given to Avelino on August 18, 2004, increasing 
the total principal loan to $4,300.00.
[19]


Teofilo admitted that Promissory Note 2000029B dated February 20, 2004 
which Ridao signed was changed to another date, August 20, 2004, since 
the $3,000.00 balance of the loan was only given on said date. Thus, the
 date on the Promissory Note was altered by Teofilo without the 
knowledge of Ridao.
[20]
 

Teofilo averred that the initial amount of $1,000.00 given to Ridao was 
for the interest of the $4,000.00 principal loan and the total amount 
payable was $6,167.00
[21]
 
broken down as follows: 
 
 
Principal amount 
 
  
 
$4,000.00 
 
 
 
Add:

2,167.00 
 
 
 
Total Loan 
 
  
 
$6,167.00 
 
 
 Further, Teofilo admitted, based on Avelino's ledger submitted by Ridao,
 that he received payments in the amount of $300.00 dated November 9, 
2004, $300.00 dated December 22, 2004, $300.00 dated January 6, 2005, 
and $200.00 dated February 10, 2005 in the total amount of $1,100.00.
[22]

 Teofilo testified that the first and second payments were signed by him
 and the third and fourth payments by Zoraida. Teofilo disputed 
receiving the amounts of $800.00, $900.00, and $1,500.00 since serial 
numbers of the dollar bills given, a policy of Handmade Credit, were not
 placed in the ledger.
[23]
 
However, Teofilo admitted that since his brother Avelino was the one who
 made the payments, they did not issue any receipt since the ledger 
already indicated receipt of payment.
[24]


In a Decision
[25]
 dated 
January 11, 2016, the RTC resolved the case in favor of Ridao. The RTC 
held that the ledger, not specifically denied under oath by Handmade 
Credit, was deemed admitted. The RTC stated that the amount of $4,300.00
 paid by Ridao was enough to pay for the principal amount of the loan, 
as well as interest. The RTC declared that the 4% monthly interest to 
the principal loan was iniquitous, exorbitant, unconscionable and 
against public policy. Using the rate of 12% interest per annum, the RTC
 held that the loan was a forbearance of money. Thus, the principal 
amount of the loan including interest had been fully paid and completely
 satisfied.

Also, the RTC declared that the additional loan of P40,000.00 was void 
or non-existent since Ridao was abroad at the time the promissory note 
was executed. Thus, the contract cannot be ratified nor the right to set
 up the defense of illegality be waived. The dispositive portion of the 
Decision states:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, plaintiffs Complaint is hereby ORDERED DISMISSED for LACK OF MERIT.

Also, defendant's Counterclaim is likewise DISMISSED.

SO ORDERED.
[26]


Handmade Credit filed a petition before the CA. 
Ruling of the CA


In a Decision
[27]
 dated August 16, 2017, the CA partly granted the petition in favor of Handmade Credit. The dispositive portion states:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is 
PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated January 11, 2016 of the Regional 
Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Branch 48 in 
Civil Case No. U-10217

 is MODIFIED. Defendant-Appellee Gemma A. Ridao is hereby ordered to pay
 Plaintiff-Appellant Handmade Credit & Loans, Inc. the sum of 
$3,200.00 or its Peso equivalent at the time of payment plus 6% interest
 per annum from the date of filing of the complaint, My 11, 2013.

SO ORDERED.
[28]


The CA found that the Promissory Notes dated February 20, 2004 and 
August 20, 2004 were both void since the promissory notes showed traces 
of material alterations, tampering and superimpositions. The CA stated 
that in the February 20, 2004 Promissory Note, the date when the note 
was granted and the due date had been materially altered. Also, the 
original dates were no longer visible since they had been superimposed 
with the date February 20, 2004, for date of grant and February 20, 
2005, for the due date. Likewise, in the August 20, 2004 Promissory 
Note, the date when the note was granted and the due date had been 
materially altered. The original date of grant, February 20, 2004, was 
changed to August 20, 2004 and August 20, 2005 was superimposed on the 
original due date written on the note. Also, the original figures stated
 in the installment column and the amount column were erased.
[29]
 

The CA held that since the alterations were made without the 
acquiescence of the other contracting party, Ridao, the instrument was 
void and Handmade Credit, being the party which caused the alterations, 
cannot enforce the terms of the altered promissory notes.

However, the CA found that since Ridao admitted borrowing $4,300.00 from
 Handmade Credit and its representatives, Teofilo and Zoraida, where 
only the total amount of $1,100.00 was acknowledged received by them as 
payments, then Ridao has the burden to prove payment of the remaining 
balance of the loan.
[30]
 

The CA stated that in the entries in the page of Avelino's ledger, the 
first four payments were recorded in detail, but the sudden change in 
the usual manner of recording the payments for the alleged fifth, sixth,
 and seventh payments were irregular and casts doubt on the authenticity
 of the entries. The CA added that no explanation was provided by Ridao 
to clarify why the serial numbers of the bills were omitted and why only
 the seventh payment in the amount of $1,500.00 was dated. Ridao also 
failed to identify who received the fifth, sixth, and seventh payments. 
Thus, the CA held that Ridao failed to present sufficient proof that the
 full amount of the $4,300.00 loan had been settled. As a result, Ridao 
should be liable for the unpaid balance in the amount of $3,200.00 or 
its peso equivalent, with interest.
[31]


Ridao filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied by the CA in a Resolution
[32]
 dated January 11, 2018.

Hence, this petition.


The Issue


Whether or not the appellate court committed reversible error in 
ordering Ridao to pay the sum of $3,200.00 or its peso equivalent, with 
interest.
[33]


The Court's Ruling


The petition is meritorious. 

Petitioner Ridao contends that respondent Handmade Credit had impliedly 
admitted the genuineness and due execution of the ledger where payment 
had been acknowledged by Handmade Credit when Handmade Credit failed to 
file a Reply and specifically deny the actionable document attached by 
Ridao in her Answer in accordance with Section 8, Rule 8 of the Rules of
 Court.
[34]
 Also, Ridao 
asserts that Handmade Credit's representative, Teofilo, in filing the 
complaint, deliberately lied when he signed the verification alleging 
that Ridao had not paid a single centavo for her obligation. Also, in 
his testimony during the trial, Teofilo admitted receipt of several 
payments only after a copy of the ledger had been presented by Ridao. 
Thus, Ridao contends that had it not been for the ledger that she 
submitted as proof of payment and attached to her Answer, Handmade 
Credit would have been enriched by its allegation of non-payment of her 
obligation. 
Respondent Handmade Credit maintains that the ledger is not an 
actionable document. The ledger merely indicates that money was 
received, but does not provide for the terms and conditions of the 
transaction. Thus, there was no need to deny its genuineness and due 
execution under oath. Also, Handmade Credit insists that the existence 
of the ledger is not in issue, but its regularity, particularly the last
 three entries for $800.00, $900.00 and $1,500.00. Since Ridao did not 
further explain the discrepancies in the last three entries then Ridao 
has not presented sufficient evidence to prove payment.

Sections 7 and 8, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court states:


SEC. 7. 
Action or defense based on document
. â 
Whenever an action or defense is based upon a written instrument or 
document, the substance of such instrument or document shall be set 
forth in the pleading, and the original or a copy thereof shall be 
attached to the pleading as an exhibit, which shall be deemed to be a 
part of the pleading, or said copy may with like effect be set forth in 
the pleading.

SEC. 8. 
How to contest such documents
. â When an action or 
defense is founded upon a written instrument, copied in or attached to 
the corresponding pleading as provided in the preceding Section, 
the 
genuineness and due execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted
 unless the adverse party, under oath, specifically denies them, and 
sets forth what he claims to be the facts;
 but the requirement of an
 oath does not apply when the adverse party does not appear to be a 
party to the instrument or when compliance with an order for an 
inspection of the original instrument is refused. (Emphasis supplied)


A document is actionable when an action or defense is grounded upon such written instrument or document.
[35]

 Section 7, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court provides for the two ways of 
pleading an actionable document while Section 8, Rule 8 provides for the
 rule on implied admission (by failure to make a sworn specific denial) 
of the genuineness and due execution of a document or instrument subject
 of an action or defense.


In the present case, the complaint filed by Handmade Credit is an action
 for collection of sum of money arising from a loan obligation. The 
cause of action is on the alleged non-payment of loan obligation by 
Ridao. In her Answer, Ridao attached her late husband's payment record, a
 copy of a page of a ledger, as proof that she had fully paid for her 
obligation. Handmade Credit did not file a reply to Ridao's Answer. 
Ridao asserts that since Handmade Credit failed to file a reply 
specifically denying under oath the ledger which she attached to her 
Answer, then Handmade Credit is deemed to have admitted the said 
actionable document. 

We disagree. 

A copy of a page of a ledger is not an actionable document. The ledger 
merely indicates that money was received as payment, but it is not an 
evidence of the transaction between the parties. The ledger does not 
provide for the terms and conditions of the loan transaction from which a
 right or obligation may be established.


In 
Young Builders Corp. v. Benson Industries, Inc.
,
[36]

 we held that to qualify as an actionable document pursuant to Section 
7, Rule 8 of the Rules, the specific right or obligation which is the 
basis of the action or defense must emanate therefrom or be evident 
therein. If the document or instrument so qualifies and is pleaded in 
accordance with Section 7 â the substance set forth in the pleading, and
 the original or a copy is attached to the pleading as an exhibit â then
 the genuineness and due execution are deemed admitted unless the 
adverse party, under oath, specifically denies them, and sets forth what
 he claims to be the facts pursuant to Section 8, Rule 8 of the Rules of
 Court. 

Thus, since the copy of the ledger is not an actionable document, 
Handmade Credit's non-filing of a reply, specifically denying the 
genuineness and due execution of the ledger, cannot be considered as an 
implied admission. 
Nevertheless, even if the ledger is not an actionable document, it is 
admissible as evidence and is sufficient to prove that Ridao made 
payments for her loan obligation and that such payments were received by
 Handmade Credit.


In civil cases, only a preponderance of evidence or "greater weight of 
the evidence" is required.
[37]

 In determining where the preponderance of evidence or superior weight 
of evidence on the issues involved lies, the court may consider all the 
facts and circumstances of the case, the witness' manner of testifying, 
their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to 
which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they 
testify, the probability of their testimony, their interest or want of 
interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may 
legitimately appear upon the trial.
[38]
 
Contrary to Handmade Credit's claim in the Complaint that Ridao had not 
paid for a single centavo of her loan obligation, the existence of 
Avelino's ledger or payment record was properly identified by his 
brother, Handmade Credit's representative, Teofilo.


In his testimony, Teofilo admitted that Ridao, through Avelino, made 
several payments of her $4,300.00 obligation. Teofilo stated that Ridao 
made four separate payments of $300.00 on November 9, 2004, $300.00 on 
December 22, 2004, $300.00 on January 6, 2005, and $200.00 on February 
10, 2005 in the total amount of $1,100.00. However, Teofilo denied 
having received the last three payments in the amounts of $800.00, 
$900.00, and $1,500.00 on October 15, 2005 totaling $3,200.00 since 
Avelino's ledger did not indicate the corresponding serial numbers of 
the dollar bills, which was the usual practice of the company. 

Teofilo's justification was that since his brother Avelino was the one 
who made the payments, the company did not issue receipts anymore since 
the ledger already indicated receipt of payment. In his testimony dated 
November 25, 2014, Teofilo stated: 
Q: Who handed to you the money? Who paid the money to you? 
A: My brother Avelino Manipon, sir.


Q: Did you issue receipt? 

A: We do not issue receipt because it was already indicated in the 
ledger that we received the payment. 
Q: Is it the policy of your company not to issue receipt? 
A: Yes sir, that is the policy of the company that we do not issue 
receipt because it is already indicated in the ledger and Avelino 
Manipon is my brother that is why we did not issue receipt.
[39]
 
Having acknowledged that receipts were not issued and that they relied 
on the ledger as proof of payment on account of relationship, Handmade 
Credit cannot now allege non-payment by merely denying that it did not 
receive or collect the money in the absence of clear and competent 
evidence.

Handmade Credit is not an ordinary creditor. It is a corporation engaged
 in the business of lending money and is expected to transact fairly 
with its customers, whether it be a relative or third-party. As a 
lending company, it has the duty to exercise prudence and care in its 
dealings and treat all transactions in arm's length.
[40]
 

The CA, in deciding in favor of Handmade Credit, declared that since 
Ridao failed to (1) clarify why the serial numbers of the bills were 
omitted and why only the seventh payment in the amount of $1,500.00 was 
dated, and (2) identify who received the fifth, sixth, and seventh 
payments, then there was no full payment and Ridao was still obligated 
to pay Handmade Credit for the remaining $3,200.00 loan balance.
[41]
 
We disagree.


In 
Gumabon v. Philippine National Bank
,
[42]

 we held that it is a settled rule in evidence that the one who alleges 
payment has the burden of proving it. The burden of proving that the 
debt had been discharged by payment rests upon the debtor once the 
debt's existence has been fully established by the evidence on record. 
However, when the debtor introduces some evidence of payment, the burden
 of going forward with the evidence â as distinct from the burden of 
proof â shifts to the creditor. Consequently, the creditor has a duty to
 produce evidence to show non-payment. 
Here, Ridao readily disclosed that she had a loan obligation with 
Teofilo and presented the ledger as proof that through Avelino, she had 
fully paid for her loan obligation.


Since Ridao had shown evidence of payment, upon presentation of 
Avelino's payment record, then the burden to go forward with the 
evidence and to prove non-payment shifted to Handmade Credit.


During the trial, Handmade Credit, through Teofilo, denied receiving the
 last three payments in the total amount of $3,200.00 invoking that some
 had no dates of payment, signatures were not his and there were no 
dollar bill serial numbers indicated. However, aside from the denial, 
Handmade Credit did not produce any other sufficient evidence to support
 the allegations. Handmade Credit could not produce any receipt of past 
payments to counter the contents of the ledger since it also relied on 
the ledger as its proof that it received the individual payments. 

Further, based on the CA's findings that Handmade Credit caused material
 alterations, tampering and superimpositions on the Promissory Notes, 
Handmade Credit's credibility is in question. As observed by the CA:


We find both promissory notes to be void. A careful scrutiny
 of the February 20, 2004 and August 20, 2004 negotiable promissory 
notes shows that there were traces of material alterations, tampering 
and superimpositions in the instrument. x x x

In the February 20, 2004 promissory note, the date when the note was 
granted and the due date had been materially altered. The original dates
 were no longer visible because they had been superimposed with February
 20, 2004, for date of grant, and February 20, 2005, for the due date.

On the other hand, in the August 20, 2004 promissory note, the date when
 the note was granted and its due date had been materially altered. The 
original date of grant, February 20, 2004, was changed to August 20, 
2004. August 20, 2005 was superimposed on the original due date written 
on the note. Likewise, the original figures stated in the installment 
column and the amount column were obliterated. x x x

[T]he alterations that were made without the assent of the other 
contracting party, Ridao, produces the effect of avoiding the 
instrument. Thus, the party causing the material alterations, Handmade, 
cannot enforce the terms of the altered promissory notes.

The alterations in the February 20, 2004 and the August 20, 2004 
promissory notes are too uncanny for [u]s to believe that it is genuine,
 or at the very least, altered with the consent of the borrower. x x x 
Teofilo even admitted during his testimony that the alterations were 
done without Ridao's consent x x x .

We conclude that due to the apparent material alterations in the 
February 20, 2004 promissory note and the August 20, 2004 promissory 
note, they are void and cannot be made a source of Ridao's obligation. 
The absence of any proof to show that the parties countersigned and 
affirmed the alteration proves that Ridao did not consent to the 
alterations 
[43]


The Promissory Notes were the principal evidence submitted by Handmade 
Credit in order to collect money from Ridao allegedly for nonÂ­payment of
 the loan. Because of the material alterations, tampering and 
superimpositions, the CA correctly declared the Promissory Notes as void
 and one that cannot be a source of any obligation. Thus, weighing these
 findings with the non-presentation of other competent evidence to prove
 that Ridao had not fully paid for her loan obligation, we cannot 
sustain Handmade Credit's claim.
