INTING, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition
[1]
 for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated February 26, 2015 and the Resolution
[3]

 dated February 15, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. CV No. 
98170. The CA reversed and set aside the Orders dated April 30, 2010
[4]
 of Branch 136 and October 18, 2011
[5]

 of Branch 57, both of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City in 
Civil Case No. 01-1438 dismissing the complaint for sum.of money and 
damages (complaint) filed by the Development Bank of the Philippines 
(DBP) against Hermosa Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. (Hermosa Bank). 
The Antecedents


The facts are stated in the Decision of the CA.

DBP obtained a loan from the National Economic Development Authority 
(NEDA) through the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF). DBP made 
the IGLF proceeds available to participating financial institutions by 
way of subsidiary loans. Hermosa Bank applied for and was accredited by 
DBP as a participating financial institution. Hermosa Bank, through its 
President and General Manager Benjamin Cruz (Benjamin), executed 
Subsidiary Loan Agreements in favor of DBP Thereafter, Hermosa Bank, on 
various dates, applied for IGLF loans for relending to several 
sub-borrowers or investment enterprises, submitting to the DBP the IGLF 
loan applications together with supporting documents. DBP subsequently 
approved Hermosa Bank's loans and released the proceeds of each loan to 
the bank. In turn, Hermosa Bank issued and submitted to DBP the 
corresponding certificates of time deposit/promissory notes, deeds of 
undertaking, and other loan documents.
[6]
 
On September 25, 2001, DBP filed a complaint against Hermosa Bank and 
its officers, namely: Benjamin, Ligaya Cruz, Rodolfo Buenaventura, 
Librada Dio, Nilda Fajardo, and Lelaine Fernandez (Bank Officers). The 
case was raffled to Branch 136, RTC, Makati City (RTC Branch 136) and 
docketed as Civil Case No. 01-1438. In the complaint, DBP alleged that 
Hermosa Bank failed to remit the amortizations due on its IGLF loans 
despite demand; and that its subsidiary loan was declared in default.
[7]
 

Meanwhile, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) examined the account of
 Hermosa Bank. The BSP then sent a letter to DBP stating that a regular 
examination of Hermosa Bank's loan portfolio aroused suspicions of 
tampering and alterations of various loan documents and certificates of 
title evidencing ownership of the collaterals.
[8]
 
DBP conducted its own verification of the loan portfolio. DBP discovered
 and alleged that: there were several fraudulent, deceitful, and 
unlawful acts in the preparation and execution of the loans and their 
collateral documents. Hermosa Bank, through the indispensable 
cooperation of its directors, officers, and employees had submitted 
fictitious and falsified documents relative to the IGLF loans with the 
intent to defraud DBP. The fraudulent acts constituted sufficient 
grounds for the issuance of a writ of preliminaiy attachment in its 
favor. As of June 30, 2001, Hermosa Bank's aggregate availment of the 
IGLF loan facility amounted to P438,235,392.60. Thus, DBP prayed for the
 issuance 
ex parte
 of a writ of preliminary attachment against 
the properties of all the defendants named in the complaint and a 
judgment ordering them, jointly and severally, to pay the amount of 
P438,235,392.60, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of the 
proceedings.
[9]
 

On November 13, 2001, RTC Branch 136 issued a Writ of Preliminary 
Attachment upon DBP's posting of a bond. A notice of garnishment was 
subsequently served. In an Order dated October 14, 2003, RTC Branch 136 
lifted and discharged the Writ of Preliminary Attachment upon the 
instance of Hermosa Bank. However, pursuant to the Decision
[10]
 of the CA in CA-GR SP No. 84762, RTC Branch 136 reinstated the Writ of Preliminary Attachment.
[11]
 
On February 5, 2005, the Monetary Board of the BSP closed Hermosa Bank 
and placed it under receivership with the Philippine Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (PDIC) as the appointed receiver.
[12]
 
On June 7, 2005, PDIC filed a petition for assistance in the liquidation
 of Hermosa Bank (Petition) which was raffled to Branch 5, RTC, 
Dinalupihan, Bataan (Liquidation Court) docketed as SP No. DH-025-05. 
The counsel for Hermosa Bank withdrew his appearance and was substituted
 by the Office of the General Counsel of the PDIC. The Bank Officers 
then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint before the RTC Branch 136 
on the ground that the case should be filed before the Liquidation 
Court.
[13]
 Hermosa Bank, 
likewise, filed a motion to dismiss alleging that RTC Branch 136 has no 
jurisdiction over the case pursuant to Section 30 of Republic Act No. 
(RA) 7653.
[14]


The Rulings of the RTC


The RTC Branch 136 initially dismissed the Complaint in its Order
[15]

 dated October 6, 2008, but reinstated it in an Order dated March 18, 
2009 upon DBP's motion for reconsideration. Both Hermosa Bank and the 
Bank Officers filed their respective motions for reconsideration of the 
Order dated March 18, 2009.
[16]
 

In an Order
[17]
 dated April 
30, 2010, RTC Branch 136 again dismissed the Complaint for lack of 
jurisdiction. It ruled that the Liquidation Court has the exclusive 
jurisdiction over all claims against Hermosa Bank. 

DBP filed a motion for reconsideration.

Meanwhile, RTC Branch 136 was designated as a Family Court and could no 
longer continue with the proceedings. Hence, the case was re-raffled to 
Branch 57, RTC (RTC Branch 57), Makati City.

In its Order
[18]
 dated October
 18, 2011, RTC Branch 57 denied DBP's motion for reconsideration. RTC 
Branch 57 ruled that all the assets of Hermosa Bank are deemed to be in 
custodia legis

 in the hands of its receiver, the PDIC. As such, all claims against 
Hermosa Bank should be exclusively lodged with the Liquidation Court to 
avoid multiplicity of suits.

DBP filed an appeal before the CA against the Order dated April 30, 2010
 of RTC Branch 136 and Order dated October 18, 2011 of RTC Branch 57.


The Ruling of the CA


In the assailed Decision
[19]
 
dated February 26, 2015, the CA reversed and set aside the Order dated 
April 30, 2010 of RTC Branch 136 and Order dated October 18, 2011 of RTC
 Branch 57.
[20]
 

The CA ruled that jurisdiction, once acquired, is not lost upon the 
instance of the parties; thus, it continues until the case is 
terminated; that while Hermosa Bank was placed under receivership by the
 Monetary Board of the BSP on February 5, 2005, the case filed by DBP 
has been pending with the RTC Branch 136 since September 25, 2001.
[21]
 

The CA further ruled that DBP's complaint is not among the claims that 
could properly be resolved by the Liquidation Court. It held that the 
case was filed not only against Hermosa Bank, but also against the Bank 
Officers who were impleaded in their personal capacities for their 
alleged bad faith and gross negligence in the performance of their 
duties and for their connivance with each other in perpetrating the 
fraudulent acts and deceitful schemes against the DBP; and that there 
should be a definitive ruling on the liabilities of the Bank Officers.
[22]
 

The CA likewise held that the Writ of Preliminary Attachment should be 
reinstated because its dissolution was premised on the dismissal of 
DBP's complaint.
[23]


The dispositive portion of the CA Decision dated February 26, 2015 reads:


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
GRANTED
. The Orders 
dated April 30, 2010 and October 18, 2011 issued by the Regional Trial 
Court of Makati City, Branch 136 and Branch 57, respectively, in Civil 
Case No. 01-1438, are hereby 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. The DBP's Complaint for Sum of Money and Damages against Hermosa Bank and defendants-appellees is hereby 
REINSTATED
. The Writ of Attachment dated November 13, 2001 is likewise 
REINSTATED
. The Regional Trial Court [Branch 57, Makati City] is ordered to proceed and resolve the case with dispatch.

SO ORDERED.
[24]


Hermosa Batik and the Bank Officers tiled their respective motions for reconsideration. In its assailed Resolution
[25]
 dated February 15, 2016, the CA denied the motions for lack of merit.

Hence, the petition before the Court.


The Issue


Whether RTC Branch 136 and RTC Branch 57 retained jurisdiction over the 
complaint despite the pendency of the petition for assistance in the 
liquidation of Hermosa Bank before the Liquidation Court.


The Ruling of the Court


The petition has merit. 

The CA ruled that the complaint filed by DBP against Hermosa Bank and 
the Bank Officers had been pending with the RTC long before Hermosa Bank
 was placed under liquidation. Thus, the CA held that RTC Branch 136 and
 later, RTC Branch 57, retained jurisdiction of the case on the ground 
that jurisdiction, once acquired, is not lost but continues until the 
termination of the case. 
The Court rules otherwise.


The Court held in 
Barrameda v. Rural Bank of Canaman, Inc
,
[26]
 that the rule on adherence of jurisdiction is not absolute.
[27]
 One of the exceptions to the ruie is when the change in jurisdiction is curative in character.
[28]
 According to the Court, Section 30
[29]
 of RA 7653 
"is
 curative in character when it declared that the liquidation court shall
 have jurisdiction in the same proceedings to assist in the adjudication
 of the disputed claims against the Bank."
[30]
 The Court explained that the rationale for consolidating all claims against the bank with the liquidation court is 
"to
 prevent multiplicity of actions against the insolvent bank and x x x to
 establish due process and orderliness in the liquidation of the bank, 
to obviate the proliferation of litigations and to avoid injustice and 
arbitrariness."
[31]
 The Court stated that it was the intention, of the lawmaking body 
"that
 for convenience only one court, if possible, should pass upon the 
claims against the insolvent bank and that the liquidation court should 
assist the Superintendent of Banks and regulate his operations
."
[32]


It is of no moment that the complaint was filed by DBP before the 
Hermosa Bank was placed under receivership. The Court had ruled that the
 time of the filing of the complaint is immaterial as it is the 
execution that will obviously prejudice the bank's other depositors and 
creditors.
[33]
 
To allow the 
complaint of DBP to proceed outside the Liquidation Court could result 
to iniquity not only to Hermosa Bank's depositors who were the most 
directly affected by its closure, but also to its other creditors 
because it would prioritize DBP's claim over their claims.

The CA also committed a reversible error in ruling that the Liquidation 
Court has no jurisdiction over the bank employees who are being sued in 
their personal capacities. Section 30 of RA 7653 gives the liquidation 
court the authority to 
"adjudicate disputed claims against the 
institution, assist the enforcement of individual liabilities of the 
stockholders, directors and officers, and decide on other issues as may 
be material to implement the liquidation plan adopted."
 Hence, the 
Liquidation Court may resolve the respective liabilities, if any, of 
Hermosa Bank's officers pursuant to Section 30 of RA 7653.

Finally, the Writ of Preliminary Attachment issued by the RTC Branch 136
 is a provisional or ancillary remedy resorted to by a litigant to 
protect and preserve certain rights and interests pending final 
judgment.
[34]
 With the 
dismissal of DBP's complaint, the Writ of Preliminary Attachment no 
longer has a leg to stand on and should correctly be dissolved.


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
GRANTED
. The Decision dated 
February 26, 2015 and the Resolution dated February 15, 2016 of the 
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 98170 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. 
The Orders dated April 30, 2010 of Branch 136 and October 18, 2011 of 
Branch 57, both of the Regional Trial Court, Makati City dismissing the 
complaint for sum of money and damages are 
REINSTATED
 without 
prejudice on the part of respondent Development Bank of the Philippines 
to file its claim before Branch 5, Regional Trial Court. Dinalupihan, 
Bataan acting as a liquidation court.

 Section 30 of Republic Act No. 7653 provides:


SECTION 30. 
Proceedings in Receivership and Liquidation
.
 â Whenever, upon report of the head of the supervising or examining 
department, the Monetary Board finds that a bank or quasi-bank:

(a) is unable to pay its liabilities as they become due to the ordinary 
course of business: 
Provided
, That this shail not include 
inability to pay caused by extraordinary demands induced by financial 
panic in the banking community;

(b) has insufficient realizable assets, as determined by the 
Bangko Sentral
,
 to meet its liabilities; or

(c) cannot continue in business without involving probable losses to its
 depositors or creditors; or

(d) has willfully violated a cease and desist order under Section 37 
that has become final, involving acts or transactions which amount to 
fraud or a dissipation of the assets of the inst itution; in which 
cases, the Monetary Board may summarily and without need for prior 
hearing forbid the institution from doing business in the Philippines 
and designate the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver 
of the banking institution.

For a quasi-bank, any person of recognized competence in banking or 
finance may be designed as receiver.

The receiver shall immediately gather and take charge of all the assets 
and liabilities of the institution, administer the same for the benefit 
of its creditors, and exercise the general powers of a receiver under 
the Revised Rules of Court but shall not, with the exception of 
administrative expenditures, pay or commit any act that will involve the
 transfer or disposition of any asset of the institution: 
Provided
,
 That the receiver may deposit or place the funds of the institution in 
non-speculative investments. The receiver shall determine as soon as 
possible, but not later than ninety (90) days from take-over, whether 
the institution may be rehabilitated or otherwise placed in such a 
condition so that it may be permitted to resume business with safety to 
its depositors and creditors and the general public: 
Provided
, 
That any determination for the resumption of business of the institution
 shall be subject to prior approval of the Monetary Board.
If the receiver determines that the institution cannot be rehabilitated 
or permitted to resume business in accordance with the next preceding 
paragraph, the Monetary Board shall notify in writing the board of 
directors of its findings and direct the receiver to proceed with the 
liquidation of the institution. The receiver shall:

(1) file 
ex parte
 with the proper regional trial court, and 
without requirement of prior notice or any other action, a petition for 
assistance in the liquidation of the institution pursuant to a 
liquidation plan adopted by the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation
 for general application to all closed banks. In case of quasi-banks, 
the liquidation plan shall be adopted by the Monetary Board. Upon 
acquiring jurisdiction, the court shall, upon motion by the receiver 
after due notice, adjudicats disputed claims against the institution, 
assist the enforcement of individual liabilities of the stockholders, 
directors and officers, and decide on other issues as ;iay be material 
to implement the liquidation plan adopted. The receiver shall pay the 
cost of the proceedings from the assets of the institution.

(2) convert the assets of the institution to money, dispose of the same 
to creditors and other parties, for the purpose of paying the debts of 
such institution in accordance with the rules on concurrence and 
preference of credit under the Civil Code of the Philippines and he may,
 in the name of the institution, and with the assistance of counsel as 
he may retain, institute such actions as may be necessary to collect and
 recover accounts and assets of, or defend any action against, the 
institution. The assets of an institution under receivership or 
liquidation shall be deemed in 
custodia legis
 in the hands of the
 receiver and shall, from the moment the institution was placed under 
such receivership or liquidation, be exempt from any order of 
garnishment, levy, attachment, or execution.

The actions of the Monetary Board taken under this section or under 
Section 29 of this Act shall be final and executory, and may not be 
restrained or set aside by the court except on petition for 
certiorari

 on the ground that the actior: taken was in excess of jurisdiction or 
with such grave abuse of discretion as to amount to lack or excess of 
jurisdiction. The petition for 
certiorari
 may only be filed by 
the stockholders of record representing the majority of the capital 
stock within ten (10) days from receipt by the board of directors of the
 institution of the order directing receivership, liquidation or 
conservatorship.

The designation of a conservator under Section 29 of this Act or the 
appointment of a receiver under this section shall be vested exclusively
 with the Monetary Board. Furthermore, the designation of a conservator 
is not a precondition to the designation of a receiver.
