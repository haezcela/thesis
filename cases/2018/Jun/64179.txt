[ A.C. No. 11550, June 04, 2018 ]


MANUEL B. TROVELA, COMPLAINANT, VS. MICHAEL B. ROBLES, ASSISTANT CITY PROSECUTOR; EMMANUEL L. OBUNGEN, PROSECUTOR II; JACINTO G. ANG, CITY PROSECUTOR; CLARO A. ARELLANO, PROSECUTOR GENERAL; AND LEILA M. DE LIMA, FORMER SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, RESPONDENTS.
DECISION




BERSAMIN, J.:


The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) has no jurisdiction to investigate government lawyers charged with administrative offenses involving the performance of their official duties.
The Case
The complainant initiated this disbarment complaint against Pasig City Assistant Prosecutor Michael B. Robles (Robles) of Pasig City for issuing a resolution dated September 29, 2011 recommending the dismissal of his complaint for 
estafa
 under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the 
Revised Penal Code
 against Carlo L. Katigbak (Katigbak), Carlos Pedro C. Salonga (Salonga) and Barbara B. Reyes (Reyes) for insufficiency of evidence; and against Prosecutor II Emmanuel L. ObuÃ±gen (ObuÃ±gen) and City Prosecutor  Jacinto G. Ang (Ang), both of Pasig City, for approving the recommendation of dismissal.
The complainant also seeks the disbarment of former Prosecutor General Claro A. Arellano (Arellano) and former Secretary of Justice Leila M. De Lima (De Lima) for allegedly incurring inordinate delay in issuing their resolutions resolving his petition for review and motion for reconsideration before the Department of Justice (DOJ).
Antecedents
On May 25, 2011, the complainant criminally charged Katigbak, Salonga and Reyes with 
estafa
 under Article 315(1)(b) of the 
Revised Penal Code.
In his complaint-affidavit, the complainant stated that he became the Employee Relation Director of Sky Cable on November 1, 2004; that he later on received a termination letter dated July 6, 2006 signed by Salonga informing him of his relief from work and of his compensation being paid until the effective date of his termination; that his payslips for the periods from July 16, 2006 to July 31, 2006 and from August 1, 2006 to August 15, 2006 still reflected deductions of his savings contributions to the Meralco Employees Savings and Loan Association (MESALA) amounting to P2,520.00 per payday period; that withholding taxes of P4,509.45 and P4,235.70, respectively, were also deducted from his compensation; that he discovered that such deductions were not remitted to MESALA when he closed his account on September 6, 2006; and that Sky Cable did not reimburse the amounts of his unremitted deductions despite demand.
[1]
In his resolution dated September 29, 2011,
[2]
 Robles recommended the dismissal of the complaint for insufficiency of evidence.
ObuÃ±gen and Ang approved the recommendation of dismissal on October 11, 2011.
The complainant filed his petition for review dated November 3, 2011 to appeal the dismissal of his complaint.
[3]
On February 12, 2013, Arellano issued his resolution finding no reversible error in the September 29, 2011 resolution of Robles, hence, affirming the dismissal of the complaint.
[4]
The complainant moved for reconsideration, but his motion was denied by Secretary De Lima on April 21, 2015.
[5]
Consequently, the complainant initiated disbarment proceedings against the respondents, insisting thusly:
I.
THE PREMISES CONSIDERED BY THE OPCP IN NOT FINDING PROBABLE CAUSE IN THE CASE ARE 
VERY MUCH CONTRARY 
TO
 LONG STANDING JURISPRUDENCE
 HOLDING THAT 
DEMAND IS NOT A CONDITION PRECEDENT
 TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE CRIME OF EMBEZZLEMENT WHICH MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY 
OTHER PROOF
 AND THAT 
FAILURE TO ACCOUNT,
 UPON DEMAND, FOR 
FUNDS OR PROPERTY HELD IN TRUST IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF MISAPPROPRIATION.
[6]
II.
BUT WHILE THE APPLICATION OF THESE RULINGS HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY, REPEATEDLY AND UNEQUIVOCABLY MADE IN 
MORE RECENT
 CASES, IN ACTING ON MY 
3 NOVEMBER 2011
 PETITION FOR REVIEW AND ON MY 
13 MARCH 2013
 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, RESPECTIVELY, RESPONDENTS
 ARELLANO
 AND 
DE LIMA
 STILL 
SUSTAINED
 THE 
WRONG
 PRESUMPTIONS MADE BY THE OPCP, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
[7]
III.
TOGETHER WITH SUCH OMISSIONS, THE 
INORDINATE DELAYS
 ON THE PART OF RESPONDENTS 
ARELLANO
 AND 
DE LIMA
 IN COMING OUT WITH THEIR SEPARATE RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE MERELY ANCHORED ON THE 
GROSSLY ERRONEOUS FINDINGS
 OF THE OPCP 
NEGATE
 THEIR ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY ACTUALLY EXAMINED THE RECORDS OF THE CASE AND THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE PRESENTED AND INDICATED THEIR 
LACK OF RESOLVE
 TO SEE THAT 
JUSTICE IS DONE.
[8]
IV.
WHILE THE PRESENCE OF THE 
PRIMA FACIE 
EVIDENCE OF CORRUPTION 
AND OTHER
 ANOMALOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
 IN THE 
PERJURY 
AND 
UNJUST JUDGMENT 
CASES, THE 
MANIPULATIVE SCHEMES
 EMPLOYED BY SKY CABLE IN CERTAIN OF ITS PLEADINGS (sic) AND THE 
INORDINATE DELAYS
 IN ALL THE RELATED CASES ARE 
VERY OBVIOUS,
 RESPONDENT 
DE LIMA,
 DESPITE BEING THE SECRETARY OF JUSTICE THEN, 
TOTALLY IGNORED
 THE SAME.
[9]
V.
ABOVE ALL, RESPONDENT 
DE LIMA
 TOOK ACTION ON THE 
ESTAFA
 CASE 
AHEAD
 OF THE OTHER CASES 
WITHOUT CONSOLIDATING
 THEM DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL INDICATIONS CLEARLY POINT TO SUCH CONSOLIDATION.
[10]
VI.
THAT SAID, IT IS 
QUITE OBVIOUS
 THAT ALL OF THE RESPONDENTS HAD NOT ONLY 
RENEGED
 ON THEIR 
SWORN DUTY
 TO 
UPHOLD
 THE LAWS OF THE LAND, BASICALLY AS LAWYERS AND AS PROSECUTORS OR DISPENSERS OF JUSTICE, WHICH 
COMPROMISED
 THE 
EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE,
 BUT THEY ALSO COMMITTED 
GROSS VIOLATIONS
 OF CERTAIN LAWS THEMSELVES.
[11]
Should the respondents be administratively disciplined based on the allegations of the complainant?
Ruling of the Court
We dismiss the administrative case against the respondents for lack of jurisdiction.
In his complaint-affidavit, the complainant has posited that Robles, ObuÃ±gen and Ang committed grave errors of facts and law that require an inquiry into their mental and moral fitness as members of the Bar; and that Arellano and Secretary De Lima be declared guilty of dereliction of duty or gross inexcusable negligence for belatedly resolving his petition for review and motion for reconsideration. He specifically prays that the Court grants the following reliefs, namely:
x x x x
1. Finding 
prima facie 
cases against them for violation of 
Art. 208
 of the RPC and 
R.A. No. 3019, 
as amended, a.k.a. the 
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, 
and referring the matter to the appropriate governmental agency for the prosecution thereof;
2. Imposing appropriate disciplinary action against them, including their 
disbarment
 and/or 
removal from office,
 for gross violation of the canons of the legal profession or for unprofessional conduct that casts serious doubt upon their mental and moral fitness as members of the Bar and as prosecutors;
3. Awarding costs of suit hereof in such amounts as may be commensurate with the extent and degree of misconduct committed by each of them and recommending that I be awarded corresponding actual, as well as moral, exemplary and compensatory damages; and
4. Providing such other reliefs as this Honorable Court may deem just and equitable under the premises.
[12]
x x x x
The acts complained of undoubtedly arose from the respondents' performance or discharge of official duties as prosecutors of the Department of Justice. Hence, the authority to discipline respondents Robles, ObuÃ±gen, Ang and Arellano exclusively pertained to their superior, the Secretary of Justice. In the case of Secretary De Lima, the authority to discipline pertained to the President. In either case, the authority may also pertain to the Office of the Ombudsman, which similarly exercises disciplinary jurisdiction over them as public officials pursuant to Section 15, paragraph 1, of Republic Act No. 6770 
(Ombudsman Act of 
1989). Indeed, the accountability of respondents as officials performing or discharging their official duties as lawyers of the Government is always to be differentiated from their accountability as members of the Philippine Bar. The IBP has no jurisdiction to investigate them as such lawyers.
The Court has recently made this clear in 
Alicias, Jr. v. Macatangay
[13]
 by holding as follows:
Republic Act No. 6770 (R.A. No. 6770), otherwise known as "The Ombudsman Act of 1989," prescribes the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman. Section 15, paragraph 1 of R.A. No. 6770 provides:
Section 15. 
Powers, Functions and Duties. 
â The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties:
(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient. It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of his primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases.
The 1987 Constitution clothes the Office of the Ombudsman with the administrative disciplinary authority to investigate and prosecute any act or omission of any government official when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient. The Office of the Ombudsman is the government agency responsible for enforcing administrative, civil, and criminal liability of government officials "in every case where the evidence warrants in order 
to promote efficient service by the Government to the people."
 In 
Samson v. Restrivera, 
the Court ruled that the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman encompasses all kinds of malfeasance, misfeasance, and non-feasance committed by any public officer or employee during his or her tenure. Consequently, acts or omissions of public officials relating to the performance of their functions as government officials are within the administrative disciplinary jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman.
In 
Spouses Buffe v. Secretary Gonzales, 
the Court held that the IBP has no jurisdiction over government lawyers who are charged with administrative offenses involving their 
official duties.
 In the present case, the allegations in Alicias' complaint against Atty. Macatangay, Atty. Zema, Atty. Ronquillo, and Atty. Buenaflor, which include their (1) failure to evaluate CSC records; (2) failure to evaluate documentary evidence presented to the CSC; and (3) non-service of CSC Orders and Resolutions, all relate to their misconduct in the discharge of their official duties as government lawyers working in the CSC. Hence, the IBP has no jurisdiction over Alicias' complaint. These are acts or omissions connected with their duties as government lawyers exercising official functions in the CSC and within the administrative disciplinary jurisdiction of their superior or the Office of the Ombudsman.
WHEREFORE,
 the Court 
DISMISSES
 the disbarment complaint filed against all the respondents for lack of jurisdiction.
SO ORDERED.
Velasco, Jr. (Chairperson), Leonen, Martires,
 and 
Gesmundo, JJ.,
 concur.
