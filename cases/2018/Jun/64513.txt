CAGUIOA, J:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review
[1]
 (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated November 24, 2016 (Assailed Decision) and Resolution
[3]
 dated March 30, 2017 (Assailed Resolution) of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 38335, which affirmed the Decision
[4]
 dated November 25, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 5, Lemery, Batangas (RTC Decision), finding petitioner Hilario B. Aliling 
alias 
"Larry" (Aliling), guilty of Frustrated Murder and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of
 reclusion temporal 
as maximum. 
 
The Facts
 
 Aliling was charged under the following Information: 
 
 That on or about the 18
th
 day of April, 2010, at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, at Barangay Matingain 1, Municipality of Lemery, Province of Batangas, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with an unlicensed short firearm, with intent to kill and with the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, without any justifiable cause, did then and there [willfully], unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, and shoot with the said firearm one Jerry Tumbaga y Marasigan, suddenly and without warning, thereby inflicting upon the latter 0.5 cm Gun Shot Wound L1-L2 Paravertebral Area, Left and 0.5 cm.[ gunshot wound], Infrascapular Area, Right which required medical attendance and incapacitated him from performing his customary work for a period of more than three (3) months, the said accused having performed all the acts of execution which should have produced the crime of murder as a consequence, but which nevertheless was not produced by reason of some cause independent of the will of the perpetrator, that is because of the timely and able medical attendance rendered to the said Jerry Tumbaga y Marasigan, which prevented his death.
 
 Contrary to law.
[5]
 
 
 Aliling filed a Motion for Bail which was approved by the RTC in its Order
[6]
 dated August 24, 2010. Upon arraignment, Aliling pleaded "not guilty."
[7]
 The RTC summarized the facts for both the prosecution and the defense, as follows:
 VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION 
 
 The prosecution first presented the alleged victim in this case, Jerry Tumbaga y Marasigan. The witness testified that on April 18, 2010, at 10:00 o'clock in the evening, he was watching a basketball game in Barangay Matingain, together with his uncle Jesus Marasigan. [He] then left the place and proceeded to his motorcycle which was then parked at about 7-8 meters away. When he was about to board his motorcycle, he was shot at the back and when he looked back, he recognized accused Hilario Aliling as the one firing. The accused then fired again, and the victim was again hit at the back. The witness ran away, felt dizzy and subsequently fell down near the basketball court. The witness further testified that he was brought to Metro Lemery Hospital and after about an hour, he was transferred to Batangas Regional Hospital where he underwent surgery.
 
 The second prosecution witness is Jesus Marasigan y Camson, uncle of the private complainant. The witness testified that on the date and time alleged in the Information, he was at a basketball court in Matingain I, Lemery, Batangas together with Jerry Tumbaga. The private complainant then asked permission to leave. The private complainant then went towards his parked motorcycle in front of the basketball court. The witness saw Jerry Tumbaga [ride] his motorcycle and then suddenly, accused Hilario Aliling arrived and fired twice at the private complainant. The private complainant ran away and then fell down while the accused [likewise] ran, rode a motorcycle and escaped. Thereafter, the witness, together with other persons brought Jerry Tumbaga to Metro Lemery Hospital.
 
 The third prosecution witness was Dr. Mark Louie M. Lanting x x x who conducted the operation on Jerry Tumbaga x x x and [issued] the medico[-]legal certificate x x x dated April 29, 2010.
 
 VERSION OF THE [DEFENSE]
 
 The first [defense] witness is Hilario Aliling y Bathan. The accused testified that on April 18, 2010, between 7:00 o'clock and 8:00 o'clock in the morning, he was at Barangay Masalisi together with Annie, Tessie, Janno, Piolo[,] Coring and Melody. They were campaigning for a certain Apacible. According to the accused, they finished campaigning at around 6:00 o'clock in the evening of the same day and waited for the start of the "[
miting de avance
]". They left the "[
miting de avance
]" at around 12:00 midnight and proceeded to the house of Annie, their coordinator, at Barangay Matingain and arrived there at around 1:00 o'clock in the morning. Thereafter, he took his motorcycle and went home. The accused arrived at his house at around 1:30 o'clock. The next day, he went campaigning again.
 
 The accused further testified that he first learned that he was a suspect on June 22 when he received a subpoena. The accused went further on testifying that the private complainant [was] probably mad at him due to their previous confrontation that happened in Barangay Butong.
 
 The next defense witness was Adrian Cabral Atienza. The witness testified that on April 18, 2010, from 8:00 o'clock in the morning up to 1:00 o'clock of the following day, he was with the accused, together with several others, at Barangay Masalisi. He likewise testified that they were campaigning that day for candidate Apacible.
 
 The last defense witness was Michael Perez Bathan. [The] witness testified that he was at the basketball court in Barangay Matingain on April 18, 2010. He was then watching the basketball game when he heard two gunshots. He testified further that the private complainant was about to ride his motorcycle when he was shot. The private complainant ran and then fell to the ground. The witness also testified that he did not see accused Hilario Aliling at the place when the shooting happened and instead saw an unidentified man shot the private complainant.
[8]
 
 
 On November 25, 2015, the RTC rendered its Decision finding Aliling guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Frustrated Murder. The trial court gave more credence to the testimonies of the victim, Jerry M. Tumbaga (Tumbaga) and the other eyewitness Jesus C. Marasigan (Marasigan) who both identified Aliling as the gunman, as against Aliling's defense of alibi. The RTC noted that there was an inconsistency in Aliling's testimony when he stated that he used his motorcycle on the day of the incident but then on cross-examination, he stated that he left his motorcycle at the house of their coordinator. The lower court further held that the positive allegations of the prosecution witnesses prevailed over the negative assertions of the defense witnesses.
 Thus, Aliling filed a Notice of Appeal
[9]
 which was given due course by the RTC in its Order dated December 10, 2015. Aliling's Motion for Bail pending appeal was also granted.
[10]
 The CA affirmed the RTC Decision in its Assailed Decision. On the alibi, the appellate court noted that the corroborative witness testified that he did not know Aliling's whereabouts at the time of the incident.
[11]
 Aliling's Motion for Reconsideration
[12]
 was subsequently denied by the CA in its Assailed Resolution. Thus, he elevated the case before the Court through this Petition.
 
The Petition
 Aliling contends that the CA committed reversible error in affirming the judgment of the RTC. He maintains his innocence and alleges that the prosecution was not able to discharge the burden of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Aliling claims that the testimonial evidence of the prosecution cannot be relied on as they were inconsistent and incredible.
 Aliling also alleges that the CA failed to properly consider the defense's evidence. According to him, the defense was able to present and submit unbiased testimonies of credible witnesses who supported his alibi that he was in
 Barangay 
(
Brgy.
) Masalisi doing campaign activities until 1:00 o'clock in the morning on the day of the shooting. The eyewitness, Michael P. Bathan (Bathan), friend of both Aliling and Tumbaga, also testified that he witnessed the shooting incident and saw that the gunman was not Aliling but an unidentified person. 
 
Issue
 
 Whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC's judgment of conviction.
 
The Court's Ruling
 
 The Petition is meritorious.
 In criminal prosecutions, a person who stands charged of a crime enjoys the presumption of innocence, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights.
[13]
 He is designated as the 
accused
 precisely because the allegations against him have to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Due process dictates that an accused is entitled to a fair trial where both the prosecution and defense can present their respective versions of the events, and submit proof thereof. Accusation does not amount to conviction. Only when the prosecution has established guilt beyond reasonable doubt shall the presumption of innocence be overturned. In this case, the prosecution did not overcome the burden of proof. 
 It has been consistently held that a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 shall only raise questions of law as the Court is not a trier of facts. A factual question would necessitate the reevaluation of the evidence submitted before the trial court. This is allowed in the exceptional circumstance where the judgment is based on a misapprehension of the facts.
[14]
 Such is the situation in this case. 
Positive identification versus denial and alibi
 
 Positive testimony is generally given more weight than the defenses of denial and alibi which are held to be inherently weak defenses because they can be easily fabricated.
[15]
 However, the defenses of denial and alibi should not be so easily dismissed by the Court as untrue. While, indeed, the defense of denial or alibi can be easily fabricated, the same can be said of untruthful accusations, in that they can be as easily concocted.
 In considering the defenses of denial and alibi, the Court held in 
Lejano v. People
[16]
 
 
: But not all denials and alibis should be regarded as fabricated. Indeed, if the accused is truly innocent, he can have no other defense but denial and alibi. So how can such accused penetrate a mind that has been made cynical by the rule drilled into his head that a defense of alibi is a hangman's noose in the face of a witness positively swearing, "I saw him do it."? Most judges believe that such assertion automatically dooms an alibi which is so easy to fabricate. This quick stereotype thinking, however, is distressing. For how else can the truth that the accused is really innocent have any chance of prevailing over such a stone-cast tenet?
 
 There is only one way. A judge must keep an open mind. He must guard against slipping into hasty conclusion, often arising from a desire to quickly finish the job of deciding a case. A positive declaration from a witness that he saw the accused commit the crime should not automatically cancel out the accused's claim that he did not do it. A lying witness can make as positive an identification as a truthful witness can. The lying witness can also say as forthrightly and unequivocally, "He did it!" without blinking an eye.
[17]
 
 
 Thus, if found credible, the defenses of denial and alibi may be considered complete and legitimate defenses. The burden of proof does not shift by the mere invocation of said defenses; the presumption of innocence remains in favor of the accused.
 In alibi, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time the crime was committed, but that it was likewise physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time thereof.
[18]
 Physical impossibility refers to the distance between the place where the appellant was when the crime transpired and the place where it was committed, as well as the facility of access between the two places.
[19]
 
Purported inconsistencies in defense's evidence
 In the instant case, the RTC and CA did not give credence to the defense's testimonial evidence based on the alleged inconsistencies of the witnesses' statements. However, the Court finds that Aliling's alibi was straightforward, credible,
 and corroborated by an impartial witness. Furthermore, there was eyewitness testimony to the effect that Aliling was not the gunman
.
 Contrary to the findings of the RTC, there was no inconsistency in Aliling's testimony as regards his use of his motorcycle. Thus, a reexamination of his testimony is necessary to clarify the alleged inconsistency. Aliling testified as follows:

[22]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
 There is no inconsistency in the above testimony. In sum, Aliling testified that on April 18, 2010, he drove his motorcycle to the house of their campaign coordinator "Ate Annie" in 
Brgy.
 Matingain II. He left his motorcycle there. Together with a group of campaigners, he proceeded to 
Brgy.
 Masalisi between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on board their service vehicle, a pick-up truck. Their group finished campaigning at 6:00 p.m. They stayed in 
Brgy.
 Masalisi until the 
miting de avance
 which started at around 7:00 p.m. They left the
 miting de avance
 at around 12:00 midnight and went back to the house of "Ate Annie," using again their service vehicle. Their group arrived thereat around 1:00 a.m. Using his motorcycle, which he had left earlier, Aliling went home with his sister-in-law, and arrived at his house at 1:30 a.m.
 
 Aliling's testimony as to his whereabouts is corroborated by Adrian C. Atienza (Atienza), who testified that he was with Aliling from 8:00 a.m. on April 18, 2010 until the early morning hours of April 19, 2010:

 The above testimony of Atienza corroborates the testimony of Aliling as to his whereabouts at the time of the incident and as to the use of their service vehicle. Contrary to the findings of the CA,
[24]
 Atienza did not state that he did not know the whereabouts of his companions at the time of the incident. He stated that the whole day of April 18, 2010, he was with Aliling as they were partners in the posting of campaign materials. He also testified that he was beside Aliling during the 
miting de avance
 which coincided with the time of the shooting incident. On this point, Atienza testified as follows:

 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
 Thus, when Atienza stated that he did not know where his companions were during the 
miting de avance
, he was referring to Melody Razon, Fe Reyes, Marie Razon, and Felix Collado. With regard to his position in relation to Aliling, Atienza testified that he was beside Aliling and their coordinator, "Ate Annie."
 
 It is also worthy to note that among the witnesses, Atienza is the only one without any familial relationship with Aliling or to the victim, Tumbaga. Atienza testified that he met Aliling only during the campaign period. On the other hand, he had known Tumbaga for a long time because they lived in the same
 barangay 
and Tumbaga's grandmother was their former neighbor.
[26]
 Hence, Atienza's status as an impartial witness is beyond dispute, having no relationship with either the accused or the victim. Atienza's testimony, on this score, is straightforward, credible, and unbiased as, indeed, he has no reason to lie. 
 Bolstering the alibi of Aliling is the eyewitness account of Bathan who positively testified that he witnessed the shooting incident and saw that the culprit was not Aliling. He testified as follows:

 Eyewitness Bathan testified that he saw the shooting incident and categorically stated that the shooter was not Aliling. Bathan is familiar with the features of Aliling, having known him for a long time as they are relatives. Thus, the eyewitness account of the shooting bolsters Aliling's denial that he was not the gunman.
 
 
Testimonial evidence for the prosecution
 
 The Court has held that "[s]elf-contradictions and inconsistencies on a very material and substantial matter seriously erodes the credibility of a witness."
[28]
 As the Court further held in 
People v. Amon
[29]
: 
 
For evidence to be believed "must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but must be 
credible in itself
 â such as the
 common experience
 and
 observation
 of mankind can approve 
as probable
 under the circumstances. There is no test of the truth of human testimony, except its 
conformity
 to 
our knowledge, observation 
and 
experience
. Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance."
[30]
 
 
 
 In the instant case, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are contradictory on a material point. Marasigan claimed that the gunshots were successively fired. He testified as follows: 
 
[

]
 
 
 
Q
 
You said that you witnessed the shooting of your nephew, do you recall how were the shots fired against (sic) your nephew?
 
 
 
A
 
He took his gun from his pocket. Witness pointing to his right pocket. Then he fired shots at my nephew. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
Were the shots fired one after the other?
 
 
 
A
 
Yes ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 It was one shot right after the other? 
 
 
 
A
 
Yes ma'am.
[31]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
However, the victim, Tumbaga testified that there was a pause between the shots: 
 
 
[

] 
 
 
 
Q
 
You also testified before that your position was your back was facing the assailant, correct?
 
 
 
A
 
Yes, ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
Incidentally, how were the shots fired, one after the other?
 
 
 
A
 
 
The first shot hit me at the back and when I turned my back I saw the accused firing at me, ma'am. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
Not immediately one after the other?
 
 
 
 
A
 
Yes ma'am. There was a pause.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
You said that you were shot for the first time and you turned your back, how did you turn your back? 
 
 
 
A
 
 Like this ma'am.

Q
 
Then the second shot was fired?
 
 
 
A
 
When I was about to descend or alight from the motorcycle he again fired at me, ma'am.

Q
 
Were you hit by the second fire? 
 
 
 
A
 
Yes, Your Honor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
Where, what part of your body? 
 
 
 
A
 
Here, Your Honor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT INTERPRETER
 
 
 
 
(Witness pointing to his back.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
So, both gunshots hit you at the back? 
 
 
 
A
 
Yes, Your Honor.
[32]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
 At first glance, it would seem that the succession of the gunshots is not a material point. However, the manner of execution of the crime is of prime significance especially in the testimony of Tumbaga, the victim himself, as he testified that the pause between shots supposedly gave him the opportunity to turn his head and see the culprit after he was shot for the first time in the back. However, this testimony is contradicted by Marasigan who testified that the shots were successive. Notably, the testimony of Marasigan as to the continuous succession of shots is corroborated by the testimony of defense witness Bathan, who also testified that the shots were fired one after another.
[33]
 
 Furthermore, in his 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
[34]
 dated April 22, 2010, which he identified and authenticated before the RTC, Tumbaga attested that Aliling had a companion that night at the basketball court. However, during his cross-examination, he denied his statement: 
 
 [
Cross-examination of Tumbaga by Atty. Magsombol
] 
 
 
 
Q
 
When you said that it was the accused who shot you, can you describe his attire that night? 
 
 
 
A
 
He was wearing a jacket, ma'am. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
What kind?
 
 
 
A
 
A black jacket, ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
You also said that he was with somebody?
 
 
 
A
 
 I do not know whether he has a companion during that time, ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
You do not know?
 
 
 
A
 
 
I saw him only, ma'am.
[35]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
 
 
The Court has previously held that minor inconsistent statements in a witness' affidavit and in his testimony in court do not necessarily affect his credibility.
[36]
 However, in this case, the detail as to whether the victim had seen the accused with or without a companion is a material detail as it goes into the very execution of the crime.
 
 The inconsistency in the statements of the prosecution witnesses on material points significantly erodes the credibility of their testimonies, juxtaposed against the forthright and consistent testimonies of the defense witnesses. With the probative value of the prosecution witnesses' testimony greatly diminished, the alibi of the accused is given credence. In the instant case, the prosecution failed to overcome the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Acquittal, therefore, is in order.
 In this jurisdiction, no less than proof beyond reasonable doubt is required to support a judgment of conviction. While the law does not require absolute certainty, the evidence presented by the prosecution must produce in the mind of the Court a moral certainty of the accused's guilt. When there is even a scintilla of doubt, the Court must acquit.
[37]
 
As the Court succinctly held in 
People v. Erguiza
[38]
: 
 
 It is the primordial duty of the prosecution to present its side with clarity and persuasion, so that conviction becomes the only logical and inevitable conclusion. What is required of it is to justify the conviction of the accused with moral certainty. Upon the prosecution's failure to meet this test, acquittal becomes the constitutional duty of the Court, lest its mind be tortured with the thought that it has imprisoned an innocent man for the rest of his life.
