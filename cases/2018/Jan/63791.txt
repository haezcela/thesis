TIJAM, J.:


Before Us is a petition
[1]
 for 
certiorari

 and prohibition under Rule 65, seeking to declare null and void the 
Decision dated January 31, 2011 of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) in
 CSC Decision
[2]
 No. 11-0047, 
which declared null and void the Memorandum issued by Chairman Bernardo 
Abesamis (Chairman Abesamis) of the Career Executive Service Board 
(CESB).
 
The Facts


 Private respondent Blesilda  Lodevico (Lodevico) was appointed
 by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on May 14, 2008 as Director 
III, Recruitment and Career Development Service, CESB.
[3]

 Lodevico possesses a Career Service Executive Eligibility since 
November 29, 2001, as evidenced by the Certificate of Eligibility issued
 by the CSC.
[4]


 On June 30, 2010, the Office of the President (OP) issued 
Memorandum Circular No. 1 (MC 1), which declared all non-Career 
Executive Service positions vacant as of June 30, 2010 and extended the 
services of contractual employees whose contracts expire on June 30, 
2010.
[5]
 On July 16, 
2010, the OP promulgated the Implementing Guidelines of MC 1, which 
states that all non-Career Executive Service Officers (nonÂ­ CESO) in all
 agencies of the Executive Branch shall remain in office and continue to
 perform their duties until July 31, 2010 or until their resignations 
have been accepted and/or their replacements have been appointed or 
designated, whichever comes first.
[6]
 Acting pursuant to MC 1 and its implementing guidelines, Chairman Abesamis of the CESB issued a Memorandum
[7]

 which informed Lodevico that she shall only remain in office and 
continue to perform her duties and responsibilities until July 31, 2010.
[8]

 Meanwhile, Memorandum Circular No.2 (MC 2), which extended the term 
stated under MC 1 to October 31, 2010, was issued on July 29, 2010. The 
same circular provides that all non-CESO occupying Career Executive 
Service (CBS) positions in all agencies of the Executive Branch shall 
remain in office and continue to perform their duties and discharge 
their responsibilities until October 31, 2010 or until their 
resignations have been accepted and/or until their respective 
replacements have been appointed or designated, whichever comes first, 
unless they are re-appointed in the meantime. However, any official 
whose service has been terminated or whose resignation has been accepted
 on/or before July 31, 2010, but whose replacement has not yet been 
appointed or designated shall be deemed separated from service as of the
 date of termination or acceptance of resignation.
[9]
 Lodevico filed her appeal on the Memorandum issued by Chairperson Abesamis before the CSC.
 On September 21, 2010, CESB received a Notice from CSC, requiring it to file a comment.
[10]
 On October 1, 2010, CESB filed its Comment,
[11]
 assailing the jurisdiction of CSC to hear and decide the appeal.
 On January 31, 2011, the CSC rendered the assailed Decision
[12]

 which granted the appeal of Lodevico and declared null and void the 
termination of her services. The CSC ruled that CESB Chairman Abesamis 
has no power to terminate the services of Lodevico. As the latter was a 
presidential appointee, only the President has the authority to do so. 
Hence, the Memorandum issued by Chairman Abesamis is null and void. 
Also, the CSC pointed out that the services of a non-CESO occupying CES 
position in all agencies of the Executive Branch have been extended 
until October 31, 2010 pursuant to MC 2. The dispositive portion reads:
  


 
WHEREFORE
, the appeal of [Lodevico], Director III, [CESB] is 
GRANTED
.
 The Memorandum dated July 29, 2010 of CESB [Chairman Abesamis], 
informing Lodevico that, pursuant to the provisions of [MC 1] and its 
Implementing Guidelines, and after a consensus arrived at by the members
 of the CES Governing Board in consultation with the CESB Executive 
Director, her service as CESB Director III is terminated effective July 
31, 2010 is hereby declared 
NULL and VOID
. Accordingly, Lodevico 
is reinstated to her former position as Director III and shall be paid 
her back salaries and other benefits corresponding to the period of her 
illegal termination.
[13]




 CESB filed an Omnibus Motion for Clarification and/or Reconsideration,
[14]
 assailing the jurisdiction of CSC to issue the assailed decision.
 In a Resolution
[15]
 dated April 7, 2011, the CSC denied the motion for reconsideration. The 
fallo
 thereof states:
  


 
WHEREFORE
, the motion for reconsideration of the [CESB] is hereby 
DENIED
. Accordingly, the [CSC] Decision No. 11-0047 dated January 31, 2011, 
STANDS
.
[16]




 Hence, this petition.
 In their Comment, Lodevico and CSC 
mainly argue that the latter acted within the bounds of its authority in
 issuing the assailed decision as it has jurisdiction over her appeal. 
Also, they contend that the petitioners resorted to a wrong mode of 
appeal. Hence, the petition should be dismissed.
 
Issue


 Is the dismissal of Lodevico as Director III, Recruitment and Career Development Services from the CESB, proper? 
 
Ruling of the Court


 Procedurally, respondents question the impropriety of filing a petition for
 certiorari 
and prohibition under Rule 65 as the proper mode of appeal is 
via 
petition for review under Rule 43. 
  
 It is well-settled that the extraordinary remedies of 
certiorari 
and
 prohibition are resorted to only where (a) a tribunal, a board or an 
officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted 
without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (b) there is no appeal 
or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[17]


 In this case, it is clear that the second requirement is absent as petition for review under Section 1
[18]

 of Rule 43 is available to petitioners. However, there are exceptions 
to the aforementioned rule, namely: "(a) when public welfare and the 
advancement of public policy dictate; (b) when the broader interests of 
justice so require; (c) when the writs issued are null; and (d) when the
 questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial 
authority."
[19]
 In the case of
 Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Leyeco IV Employees Union-ALU
,
[20]
 We relaxed the application of the rules of procedure to meet the ends of justice. In 
Leyte IV
, the petitioners filed a petition for 
certiorari 
under
 Rule 65 instead of filing a petition for review under Rule 43, but We 
gave due course to the petition to accommodate the broader interest of 
justice.
  
 In allowing the liberal application of procedural rules, We emphasized in the case of 
Obut v.	Court of Appeals, et al.
,
[21]
 that placing the administration of justice in a straightjacket, 
i.e
.,
 following technical rules on procedure would result into a poor kind of
 justice. We added that a too-rigid application of the pertinent 
provisions of the Rules of Court will not be given premium where it 
would obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice in the
 light of the prevailing circumstances of the case under consideration.
[22]
 Moreover, in the case of 
CMTC International Marketing Corp. v. Bhagis International Trading Corp.
,
[23]

 We denied the application of the technical rules to yield to 
substantive justice. In said case, We ruled that the rules of procedure 
should give way to strong considerations of substantive justice. Thus, a
 rigid application of the rules of procedure will not be entertained if 
it will obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice in 
the light of the prevailing circumstances of the case under 
consideration.
[24]
 Likewise, in the case of 
Uy v. Chua
,
[25]

 We interpreted that "[t]he Rules of Court were conceived and 
promulgated to set forth guidelines in the dispensation of justice but 
not to bind and chain the hand that dispenses it, for otherwise, courts 
will be mere slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial 
discretion."
[26]


 Considering the foregoing and the circumstances obtaining in 
this case, We allow the application of liberality of the rules of 
procedure to give due course to the petition filed by petitioners as the
 broader interest of justice so requires.
 Substantively, petitioners assert that CSC has no jurisdiction to resolve the appeal of Lodevico.

 Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution charged the CSC, as the central 
personnel agency of the Government, with the administration of the civil
 service.
[27]
 Book V, Title I,
 Subtitle A, Chapter 3, Section 12 of the Administrative Code of 1987 
provides for the powers and functions of the CSC, which, among others, 
include its power to decide and pass upon all civil service matters. On 
the other hand, CESB was specifically established to serve as the 
governing body of the CES and mandated to promulgate rules,	standards 	
and	procedures 	on 	the 	selection,	classification, compensation and 
career development of members of the CES.
[28]

 "From its inception, the CESB was intended to be an autonomous entity, 
albeit administratively attached to respondent Commission."
[29]
 As an attached agency, the decisions of the CESB are expressly subject to the CSC's review on appeal.
[30]

 As to petitioners' second contention, they aver that Lodevico's removal
 from service is justified in that her appointment as Director III, 
equivalent to Assistant Bureau Director, is not a permanent one. Hence, 
her removal from service by the CESB, following the orders of MC Nos. 1 
and 2 issued by the President was valid and she was not entitled to 
security of tenure.
 It must be noted that the President, thru the
 issuance of MC 1, effectively discharged all non-CESOs occupying CES 
positions in all agencies until July 31, 2010. MC 2 extended the term of
 their service until October 31, 2010. However, MC2 mentioned that those
 who have been terminated pursuant to the earlier Memorandum but whose 
replacement has not yet been appointed shall be deemed separated from 
service as of the date of termination.
 Going into the issue, it is necessary to determine the nature of Lodevico's position.
 The Civil Service Law classifies the positions in the civil service into career and non-career, to wit:
  


 The 
career service
 is characterized by (1) entrance based
 on merit and fitness to be determined as far as practicable by 
competitive examinations, or based on highly technical qualifications; 
(2) opportunity for advancement to higher career positions; and (3) 
security of tenure; while a 
non-career position 
is characterized 
by (1) entrance on bases other than those of the usual tests of merit 
and fitness utilized for the career service; and (2) tenure which is 
limited to a period specified by law, or which is coterminous with that 
of the appointing authority or subject to his pleasure, or limited to 
the duration of a particular project for which purpose employment was 
extended.
[31]
 (Citations omitted and emphasis ours)




 There are also three levels of positions in the career service, 
namely: (a) the first level shall include clerical, trades, crafts and 
custodial service positions which involve non-professional or 
sub-professional work in a nonÂ­ supervisory or supervisory capacity 
requiring less than four years of collegiate studies; (b) the second 
level shall include professional, technical, and scientific positions 
which involve professional, technical or scientific work in a 
non-supervisory or supervisory capacity requiring at least four years of
 college work up to Division Chief level; and (c) 
the third level shall cover positions in the Career Executive Service
.
[32]
 Under the third level, such positions in the 
Career Executive Servic
e are further classified into Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Director, 
Assistant Bureau Director
,
 Regional Director, Assistant Regional Director, Chief of Department 
Service and other officers of equivalent rank as may be identified by 
the Career Executive Service Board, all of whom are appointed by the 
President.
[33]
 As to employment status and security of tenure, appointment in the career service shall be either permanent or temporary.
[34]

 Lack of civil service eligibility makes an appointment a temporary one 
and without a fixed and definite term and dependent entirely upon the 
pleasure of the appointing power.
[35]
 On the other hand, the acquisition of security of tenure is governed by the rules and regulations promulgated by the CESB.
 Sections 2 and 3, Article I, Circular No. 2 Series of 2003 issued by the CESB provide:
  


 
Section 2. Membership in the CES. 
Upon inclusion of 
his/her name in the Roster of CES Eligibles after the conferment of CES 
Eligiblity and compliance with the other requirements prescribed by the 
Board, a CES Eligible assigned to any CES position and appointed by the 
President to a CES Rank becomes a member of the CES.


 
Section 3. Original Appointment to CES Rank. 
Appointment 
to appropriate classes, based on ranks in the CES, shall be made by the 
President from a list of CES Eligibles recommended by the Board.


 Only a CES Eligible assigned to a CES position may be appointed 
by the President to a CES Rank. The Entry Rank in the CES shall be CESO 
Rank VI regardless of the position to which a CES Eligible is assigned.




 In sum, for an employee to attain a permanent status in his 
employment, he must first be a CES eligible. Such eligibility can be 
acquired by passing the requisite civil service examinations and 
obtaining passing grade to the same.
[36]

 "At present, the CES eligibility examination process has four stages, 
namely: (1) Written Examination; (2) Assessment Center; (3) Performance 
Validation; and (4) Board Interview."
[37]

 After completing and passing the examination process, said employee is 
entitled to conferment of a CES eligibility and the inclusion of his 
name in the roster of CES eligibles. Such conferment of eligibility is 
done by the CESB through a formal Board Resolution after an evaluation 
is done of the employee's performance in the four stages of the CES 
eligibility examinations.
[38]

 Conferment of a CES eligibility does not complete one's membership in 
the CES nor does it confer security of tenure. It is also necessary that
 an individual who was conferred CES eligibility be appointed to a CES 
rank. Such appointment is made by the President upon the recommendation 
of the CESB. Only after such process will the employees appointment in 
the service be considered as a permanent one, entitling him to security 
of tenure.
[39]
 In the 
CES ranking structure, there are recognized six ranks - the highest rank
 is that of a CESO I while the lowest is that of CESO VI.
[40]

 As clearly set forth in the foregoing provisions, two requisites must 
concur in order that an employee in the career executive service may 
attain security of tenure, to wit:
  


 a) CES eligibility; and 


b) Appointment to the appropriate CES rank.
[41]




 Here, Lodevico was appointed as Director III as evidenced by a Letter
[42]

 dated May 14, 2008. The position of Director III, equivalent to 
Assistant Bureau Director, is considered as a Career Executive Service 
position, belonging to the third-level. Lodevico met the first requisite
 as she is a CES eligible, evidenced by a Certificate of Eligibility.
[43]
 However, the second requisite is wanting because there was no evidence which proves that Lodevico was appointed to a CES rank.

 Guilty of repetition, being CES eligible alone does not qualify her 
appointment as a permanent one, for there is a necessity for her 
appointment to an appropriate CES rank to attain security of tenure.

 That being said, We consider Lodevico's appointment as mere temporary. 
Such being the case, her services may be terminated with or without 
cause as she merely serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority. 
"[T]he temporary appointee accepts the position with the condition that 
he shall surrender the office when called upon to do so by the 
appointing authority."
[44]
 
Consequently, her removal from service based on MC Nos. 1 and 2, which 
discharged all non-CESO occupying CES positions in all agencies, was 
proper.
 Thus, petitioners are correct in stating that mere 
appointment of Lodevico as Director III and her CES eligibility do not 
automatically mean that her appointment becomes a permanent one. It is 
necessary that she be appointed in an appropriate CES rank to convert 
her temporary appointment into a permanent one.
