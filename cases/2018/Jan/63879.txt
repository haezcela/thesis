 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[10]
 
 
 On May 8, 2007, appellant was arraigned in all the seven Informations and pleaded not guilty. The cases were consolidated and tried jointly.
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6765
 "AAA" first met appellant who was the helper of her cousin ''CCC's" father at "CCC's" house when she went there to play. In the first week of October 2001 while at "CCC's" house, appellant made "AAA'' lie on a sofa. He undressed her, applied cooking oil on her vagina and on his penis, and then rubbed his penis against her vagina for some time. He then pulled "CCC" to the sofa and again placed cooking oil on his penis and on "CCC's'' vagina. "AAA" saw this because she was just a meter away from them. Appellant warned "AAA" and ''CCCâ not to tell anyone of what transpired otherwise he would kill them and their families.
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6766
 
 Sometime in the second or third week of October 2001, while "AAA" and "CCC' were playing at the latter's house, appellant again pulled them to a sofa. When appellant went to the kitchen, "AAA" and "CCC" tried to run away but appellant caught them at the living room. He forced ''AAA" to lie on the sofa, pulled down her pants and panties to her ankle, and applied cooking oil on his penis and her vagina. Appellant rubbed his penis on "AAA's vagina. She felt pain. Thereafter, appellant likewise pulled "CCC" to the sofa, brought down the latter's pants, and rubbed his penis against her vagina. After threatening them, appellant wore his pants and went out of the house.
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6767
 "BBB" is also a cousin of "CCC" and "AAA''. In the first week of September 2001, while she and âCCC'' were inside the latter's house, appellant suddenly pulled them to the sofa in the living room. Appellant laid âCCCâ on the sofa, applied cooking oil on her vagina and his penis, and tried to insert his penis into "CCC's" vagina. Thereafter, appellant turned to âBBB.â He made her lie on the sofa; lifted her skirt, pulled down her panties, his pants and brief, and tried to in insert his penis into her vagina. Unsuccessful, he just brushed or rubbed his penis against her vagina. "BBB" felt pain in her vagina. Appellant immediately stood up; fixed his clothes and ran away upon seeing the arrival of ''BBB's" cousins, "DDD'' and ''EEE." "BBB'' told her cousins that they were sexually molested appellant but warned them not to tell anybody because if they do appellant would kill them.
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6768
 '"CCC" knew appellant because he was the helper of her father and lived with them in their house. In the first week of September 2001, while she and her cousin "BBB" were playing inside their house, appellant closed all the windows and doors, made her lie on the sofa, lowered her pants and underwear down to her ankle, and put cooking oil on his penis and on her vagina. "BBB" saw appellant's penis penetrating "CCC's" vagina. When appellant saw "CCC's" two sisters "DDD" and "EEE" arrive, he went out of the house. 
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6769
 In the second week of October 2001, appellant laid ''CCCâ on the kitchen table, removed her pants, put cooking oil on his penis and her vagina and tried to penetrate it but was unsuccessful. 
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6770
 In the last week of October 2001, while "CCC" was sleeping in her sister's bedroom, appellant came and removed her clothes, mounted her and tried to insert his penis but he failed, albeit she felt his big penis. "CCC" did not tell her father of what happened because of appellant's threat. 
 
Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6771
 Sometime in the first week of October 2001 and while inside "'CCC's" house, appellant laid "CCC" on the sofa, put cooking oil on her vagina and his penis. He tried to insert his penis into her vagina but failed. Thereafter, appellant went outside. "CCC" did not tell anyone about the incident because of appellant's threat to kill her and her family. 
 "AAA,'' ''BBB" and "CCC" were physically examined by Dra. Bernadette Valdez (Dra. Valdez). The result of her examination which was reduced into writing
[11]
 shows no evident injury at the time of her examination though her medical evaluation does not exclude possible sexual abuse.
 Appellant denied the accusations against him claiming that he was not in the house of "CCC" when the alleged incidents happened in 2001. 
 
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court
 
 After trial, the RTC rendered on December 9, 2010 its Consolidated Judgment finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of seven counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count. He was also ordered to pay the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damages for each crime.
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
 
 The CA, in its Decision dated September 25, 2012, affirmed with modifications the RTC Consolidated Judgment in this wise: 
 
ACCORDINGLY, the Consolidated Judgment dated December 9, 2010 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, as follows: 
 
 pronouncing appellant Noel Bejim y Romero guilty of qualified rape in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-67-65 and 07-CR-67-66 and liable for Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php75,000.00 as moral damages and Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count; 
 pronouncing appellant Noel Bejim y Romero guilty of statutory rape in Criminal Case No. 07-CR-67-67 and liable for Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php75,000.00 as moral damages and Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages; and, 
 pronouncing appellant Noel Bejim y Romero guilty of statutory rape in Criminal Case Nos. 07-[CR]-67-68, 07-[CR]-67-69, 07-[CR]-67-70, and 07-[CR]-67-71 and liable for Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php75,000.00 as moral [damages] and Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count. 
 
 In Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-67-65 and 07-CR-67-66 appellant shall not be qualified tor parole. 
 
 SO ORDERED.
[12]
 
 
 Appellant interposed before this Court the present recourse adopting the same argument he raised in his brief before the CA, 
viz
.: 
 
 The court a quo gravely erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty of the crime of rape despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
[13]
 
 
 In support of his argument, appellant impugns the victims' credibilities by capitalizing on the alleged inconsistencies in their open court testimonies; their failure to shout for help during the alleged incidents; the belated filing of their complaints; and, the medical finding of no evident injury during their examination. 
 
Our Ruling
 
 The appeal lacks merit.
 The inconsistency pointed out by appellant as to whether "AAA" was alone or with "BBB" during the alleged incident on the first week of October 2001 refers merely to inconsequential matter that will not affect the determination of whether appellant is innocent of the crime charged or not. "[D]iscrepancies referring only to minor details and not to the central fact of the crime do not affect the veracity or detract from the credibility of a witness' declaration x x x."
[14]
 Respecting the alleged inconsistency on whether appellant's penis touched âAAA's" vagina or not, the same has been clarified by "AAA" herself.
[15]
 "AAA" stated that appellant's penis indeed brushed her vagina. As held in 
Dizon v. People
,
[16]
 "[i]n rape cases, the testimony of [the] complainant must be considered and calibrated in its entirety, and not in its truncated portion or isolated passages thereof. The true meaning of answers to questions propounded to a witness is to be ascertained with due consideration of all the questions and answers given thereto. The whole impression or effect of what has been said or done must be considered, and not individual words or phrases alone. Facts imperfectly stated in answer to a question may be supplied or clarified by one's answer to other questions." 
 The failure of the victims to shout for help or escape during the incidents does not undermine their credibility. It is not also fatal to the prosecution's case. â[N]o standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. People react differently to emotional stress, and rape victims are no different from them."
[17]
 Neither the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities tainted the victims' credibility. For sure, there was no prompt revelation of what befell the victims. But "long silence and delay in reporting the crime of rape have not always been construed as indications of a false accusation."
[18]
 "A rape charge becomes doubtful only when the delay in revealing its commission is unreasonable and unexplained."
[19]
 In the present case, appellant threatened the victims that he would kill them and their families if they would tell anyone of what he did to them. To our mind, this is a reasonable explanation for the delay. 
 Regarding the findings of Dra. Valdez that her physical examination on the victims shows no evident injury, this Court had already ruled that "a medical examination of the victim is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape inasmuch as the victim's testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict the [accused] of the crime."
[20]
 Appellant denies being at the house of "CCC" during the incidents. However, he failed to provide an account of his whereabouts such that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the crimes. Appellant's unsubstantiated denial must fail in light of the categorical testimonies of the victims that it was he who molested them. 
 Notably, appellant's belabored attempt to reverse his conviction is essentially anchored on credibility. The general rule is that "this Court will not disturb the findings of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses, considering that it is in a better position to observe their candor and behavior on the witness stand."
[21]
 However, this principle does not preclude a reevaluation of the evidence to determine whether material facts or circumstances have been overlooked or misinterpreted by the trial court.
[22]
 Consistent with the principle that an appeal in a criminal action opens the whole case for review, we shall now determine whether the evidence of the prosecution is sufficient to sustain the conviction of the appellant for qualified rape and statutory rape. 
 Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman with the use of force, threat or intimidation or when she is under 12 years of age or is demented. Where the victim is below 12 years old, the only subject of inquiry is whether "carnal knowledge" took place. Carnal knowledge is "the act of a man having sexual intercourse or sexual bodily connections with a woman".
[23]
 There must be proof that his penis touched the 
labias
 of the victims or slid into their female organs and not merely stroked the external surface thereof, to produce a conviction of rape by sexual intercourse.
[24]

[27]
 
 
 
 
 The foregoing revelations of "AAA'' and "BBB" show that the evidence adduced by the prosecution did not conclusively establish the element of carnal knowledge. In the aforementioned cases, there is no categorical proof of entrance or introduction of appellant's male organ into the
 labia
 of the
 pudendum
 of "AAA.'' Neither is there evidence to show that appellant made an attempt to penetrate "AAA's" vagina. The prosecutionâs evidence lacks definite details regarding penile penetration. On the contrary, "AAA'' and "BBB" stated that appellant merely "brushed or rubbed" his penis on their respective private organs. While "BBB" testified that appellant tried to insert his penis into her vagina, she nevertheless failed to state for the record that there was the slightest penetration into it. What is clear on record is that appellant merely brushed it. 
 
 The Court held in 
People v. Butiong
[28]
 that "the 
labia majora
 must be entered for rape to be consummated, and not merely for the penis to stroke the surface of the female organ. Thus, a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the
 mons pubis 
of the 
pudendum 
is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ,
 i.e
., touching of either the
 labia 
of the
 pudendum
 by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness." While ''the mere touching of the external genitalia by the penis capable of consummating the sexual act is sufficient to constitute carnal knowledge,"
[29]
 "the act of touching should be understood here as inherently part of the entry of the penis into the labias of the female organ and not mere touching alone of the mons pubis or the pudemdum."
[30]
 Indeed, the grazing of the victims' private organ caused pain, but it cannot be presumed that carnal knowledge indeed took place by reason thereof. As the Court held in 
People v. Brioso
,
[31]
 ''the Court is loath to convict an accused for rape solely on the basis of the pain experienced by the victim as a result of efforts to insert the penis into the vagina." Significantly, from their own declaration following the public prosecutor's questioning, they suffered pains not because of appellant's attempt to insert his penis but because of the grazing of their vagina. 
 Given the foregoing and since there is neither clear showing or direct proof of penile penetration or that appellant's penis made contact with the labias of the victims, which is an essential element of the crime of rape, we cannot sustain appellant's conviction for the crin1e of rape in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6765; 07-CR-6766; 07-CR-6768; 07-CR-6769 and 07-CR-6770.
 However, appellant can be convicted of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Section 5 of Republic Act (RA) No. 7610,
[32]
 which was the offense proved though he was charged with rape through sexual intercourse in relation to RA 7610, applying the variance doctrine under Section 4 in relation to Section 5 of Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.
[33]
 The crime of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of RA 7610, which was the offense proved is included in rape, the offense charged.
[34
]
 The essential elements of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 are as follows: 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) 
 
The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age
[35]
 
 
 
 
 
On the other hand, the elements of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC are as follows:
 
 
 
 
(1)
 
 
That the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
That it is done under any of the following circumstances:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a)
 
Through force, threat or intimidation;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)
 
Where the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c)
 
 
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d)
 
When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present; and
 
 
 
3)
 
That the offended party is another person of either sex.
[36]
 
 
 
 
All the elements of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC and sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 were sufficiently established in the afore-numbered cases. Specifically, appellant committed lasciviousness when he poured cooking oil on the victims' private organ and rubbed them with his penis. The victims were under 12 years of age as established by their respective birth certificate and therefore way below 18 years of age. They were subjected to "other sexual abuse" as required under Section 5(b) of RA 7610. "A child is deemed subjected to 'other sexual abuse' when he or she indulges in lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult."
[37]
 There is coercion or influence when there is some form of compulsion equivalent to intimidation which subdues the free exercise of the offended party's free will.
[38]
 In the present cases, the victims were sexually abused as they were coerced, influenced, threatened and intimidated by appellant who was the helper of "CCC's" father.
 
 Based on the evidence. established, appellant can thus be held criminally liable of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of RA 7610.

We find no compelling reason why we should not apply our earlier ratiocination in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6765, 07-CR-6766 and 07-CR-6767 to the incidents committed on "CCC" sometime in October 2001. In Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6769, "CCC'' categorically testified that appellant failed to insert his penis into her vagina because it is big. Similarly, in Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6770, "CCC" revealed that she felt pain when appellant was trying to insert his penis into her vagina because it is big. Significantly, however, we could not discern from her testimony that there was penile penetration even only in the slightest degree. To conclude that there was penile penetration simply because they felt pain when appellant tried to insert his penis into her vagina is engaging in the realm of speculation. However, the medical examination on "CCC," though not indispensable in a prosecution for rape, shows no evident injury. At this juncture, it must be stressed that in a criminal prosecution, each and every element of the crime, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Judgment must never rest on speculation or suspicion, no matter how strong it is. "Courts cannot function to supply missing links in the prosecution evidence which otherwise insufficiently proves carnal knowledge.''

[43
]
 
 
 
 
 "CCC' continued further in narrating the incident of rape allegedly committed in the first week of October 2001 (Criminal Case No. 07-CR-6771) as follows:

Q:
 
Do you know of any reason why it was not inserted enough into your vagina?
 
 
 
A:
 
Because his penis is big.
[44]
 
 
 
 
Based on the foregoing narration, the Court is convinced that in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6768 and 07-CR-6771, there was a slight penetration on "CCC's" genitalia. "CCC'' positively testified that appellant's penis indeed touched her vagina. That appellant's penis was not inserted enough only indicates that he was able to penetrate her even partially. Anyway, complete penetration is not required to consummate the crime of rape. "Full penile penetration is not a consummating ingredient in the crime of rape."
[45]
 Thus, from the testimonial account of '"CCC," the Court could reasonably conclude that there was indeed carnal knowledge by appellant of the victim "CCC." We therefore sustain the CA in finding appellant guilty of statutory rape in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6768 and 07-CR-6771, the only elements of which are "(1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) that such woman is under 12 years of age or is demented."
[46]
 
 
 With the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of appellant of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of RA 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6765, 07-CR-6766, 07-CR-6767, 07-CR-6769 and 07-CR-6770 and statutory rape in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6768 and 07-CR- 6771, having been proven, we shall now determine the appropriate penalties imposable for each offense. 
 Under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610,
[47]
 the penalty for acts of lasciviousness when the victim is under 12 years of age is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period which has a range of fourteen (14) years, (8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the full range of the penalty next lower in degree
 i.e., reclusion temporal
 in its minimum period or from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months. The maximum of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the proper penalty that could be imposed under the RPC for acts of lasciviousness which, there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance in these cases, is the medium period of 
reclusion temporal
 medium which ranges from fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and twenty (20) days to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and nine (9) days. 
 In Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6768 and 07-CR-6771, the sentence of 
reclusion perpetua
 imposed upon appellant by the CA for the crime of statutory rape is in accordance with Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610. Likewise proper are the awards of civil indemnity in the amount of Php75,000.00 and moral damages in the amount of Php75,000.00 for each count of rape. The award of exemplary damages in the amount of Php30,000.00 is increased to Php75,000.00 for each case. 
 
WHEREFORE
, the appealed September 25, 2012 Decision of the Court of Appeals is
 AFFIRMED
 with modifications. Appellant Noel Bejim y Romero is found 
GUILTY 
of: 
 1. Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6765, 07-CR-6766, 07-CR-6767, 07-CR-6769 and 07-CR-6770 and sentenced in each case to an indeterminate prison term of thirteen (13) years, nine (9) months and ten (10) days of 
reclusion temporal
 minimum, as minimum, to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and nine (9) days of 
reclusion temporal 
medium, as maximum. In addition, appellant is ordered to pay the victims the amounts of Php20,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php15,000.00 as moral damages, Php15,000.00 as exemplary damages, and Php15,000.00 as fine, for each count of acts of lasciviousness.
