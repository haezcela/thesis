 People v. Chua,
[8]
 as well modified the indeterminate sentence imposed in the estafa cases, to wit:
WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED. Accordingly, the Decision of Branch 60, Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, dated 03 April 2010, is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, thus:
'WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby renders as follows:

SO ORDERED.'
SO ORDERED.
[9]
Hence, appellant filed the instant appeal.
The Court required both parties to file their respective supplementary briefs; however, they opted not to file the same.
[10]
The Court's Ruling
The appeal is bereft of merit.
After a careful review of the records of this case, the Court finds that the prosecution, through its witnesses, was able to prove that appellant recruited private complainants tor employment as caregivers in the United Kingdom and that he collected money from them in the process. Appellant's defense of mere denial could not prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses as the Court often views with disfavor the defense of denial, especially if it is not substantiated by any clear and convincing evidence.
[11]
 It is an inherently weak defense as it is a self-serving negative evidence that cannot be given more evidentiary weight than the affirmative declarations of credible witnesses.
[12]
Moreover, it is a settled rule that factual findings of the trial courts are accorded great respect because they are in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses having had the opportunity to observe their demeanor during the trial.
[13]
 Thus, the Court finds no reason to disturb the factual finding of the RTC, which was affirmed by the CA, that appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged.
However, in view of the recent enactment of RA 10951,
[14]
 there is a
need to modify the penalties imposed by the CA insofar as the two counts of estafa, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 27592-R and 27602-R, are concerned. For committing estafa involving the amounts of P440,000.00 and P350,000.00, Article 315 of the RPC, as amended by RA 10951, now provides that the penalty of 
arresto mayor 
in its maximum period to 
prision correccional 
in its minimum period shall be imposed if the amount involved is over P40,000.00 but does not exceed P1,200,000.00. There being no mitigating and aggravating circumstance, the maximum penalty should be one (1) year and one (1) day of 
prision correccional. 
Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence is: 
arresto mayor 
in its minimum and medium periods, the range of which is one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months. Thus, the indeterminate penalty for each count of estafa should be modified to a prison term of two (2) months and one (1) day of 
arresto mayor, 
as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of 
prision correccional, 
as maximum.
In addition, an interest rate of 6% 
per annum 
is likewise imposed on the amounts of P440,000.00 and P350,000.00 from the date of finality of this Resolution until full payment.
WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the appeal is 
DISMISSED.
 The Court 
ADOPTS
 the findings of the Regional Trial Court as affirmed by the Count of Appeals. The July 31, 2014 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04624 finding appellant Moises Dejolde, Jr. 
y
 Salino guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charges against him is 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
 that, insofar as Criminal Case Nos. 27592-R and 27602-R, the indeterminate penalty of two (2) months and one (1) day of 
arresto mayor,
 as minimum, to one (1) year and (1) day of 
prision correccional, 
as maximum, is hereby imposed for each count of estafa. In addition; an interest rate of 6% 
per annum 
is likewise imposed on the amounts of P440,000.00 and P350,000.00 from the date of finality of this Resolution until full payment.
