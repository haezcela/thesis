LEONARDO-DE CASTRO,
*
 J.:


Before the Court are consolidated petitions for review on 

certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as 
amended, filed by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR):


G.R. No. 197945
 assailing the 
Decision
[1]
 dated 
February 22, 2011 and Resolution
[2]
 dated July 27, 2011 of the Court of Tax Appeals 
(CTA) in CTA 
En Banc
 Case No. 535; and




G.R. Nos. 204119-20
 assailing the 
Decision
[3]
 dated 
March 21, 2012 and Resolution
[4]
 dated October 10, 2012 of the Court of Appeals 
in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 55329-30.
Respondents Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (Shell) and Petron 
Corporation (Petron) are domestic corporations engaged in the production
 of petroleum products and are duly registered with the Board of 
Investments (BOI) under the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987.
[5]



On different occasions during 1988 to 1996, respondents separately sold 
bunker oil and other fuel products to other BOT-registered entities 
engaged in the export of their own manufactured goods (BOI export 
entities).
[6]
 
These BOT-registered export entities used Tax Credit Certificates (TCCs)
 originally issued in their name to pay for these purchases.



To proceed with this mode of payment, the BOT-registered export entities
 executed Deeds of Assignment in favor of respondents, transferring the 
TCCs to the latter. Subsequently, the Department of Finance (DOF), 
through its One Stop Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback 
Center (DOF Center), approved the Deeds of Assignment.
[7]



Thereafter, respondents sought the DOF Center's permission to use the 
assigned TCCs in settling respondents' own excise tax liabilities. The 
DOF Center issued Tax Debit Memoranda (DOF TDMs) addressed to the 
Collection Program Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR),
[8]
 allowing
 respondents to do so.



Thus, to pay for their excise tax liabilities from 1992 to 1997 (Covered
 Years),
[9]
 
respondents presented the DOF TDMs to the BIR. The BIR accepted the TDMs
 and issued the following: (a) TDMs signed by the BIR Assistant 
Commissioner for Collection Service
[10]
 (BIR TDMs); (b) Authorities to Accept Payment 
for Excise Taxes (ATAPETs) signed by the BIR Regional District Officer; 
and (c) corresponding instructions to BIR's authorized agent banks to 
accept respondents' payments in the form of BIR TDMs.
[11]



Three significant incidents arising from the foregoing antecedents 
resulted in the filing of several petitions before this Court,

Said incidents and petitions are discussed in detail below.




A. 1998 Collection Letters

    (G.R. Nos. 204119-20)



In its collection letters
[12]
 dated April 22, 1998 (1998 Collection Letters) 
addressed to respondents' respective presidents, the BIR
[13]
 pointed out that 
respondents partly paid for their excise tax liabilities during the 
Covered Years using TCCs issued in the names of other companies; 
invalidated respondents' tax payments using said TCCs; and requested 
respondent Shell and respondent Petron to pay their delinquent tax 
liabilities amounting to P1,705,028,008.06 and P1,107,542,547.08, 
respectively. The 1998 Collection Letters similarly read:


Our records show that for the years x x x, you have 
been paying part of your excise tax liabilities in the form of Tax 
Credit Certificate (TCC) which bear the name of a company other than 
yours in violation of Rule IX of the Rules and Regulations issued by the
 Board of Investments to implement P.D. No. 1789 and B.P. 391. 

Accordingly, your payment through the aforesaid TCC's are 
considered invalid and therefore, you are hereby requested to 
pay
 the amount of x x x inclusive of delinquency for late 
payments as of even date, covering the years heretofore mentioned within
 thirty days (30) from receipt hereof, 
lest we will be 
constrained to resort to 
administrative
 and legal 
remedies available in accordance with law
. (Emphasis 
supplied.)
Respondents separately filed their administrative protests
[14]
 against the 1998 
Collection Letters, but the BIR denied
[15]
 said protests. The BIR maintained that the 
transfers of the TCCs from the BOI-registered export entities to 
respondents and the use of the same TCCs by respondents to pay for their
 self-assessed specific tax liabilities were invalid, and reiterated its
 demand that respondents pay their delinquent taxes.



This prompted respondent Petron to file a Petition for Review
[16]
 before the CTA 
docketed as CTA Case No. 5657.



As for respondent Shell, it first requested for reconsideration of the 
denial of its protest by the BIR.
[17]
 However, while said request for reconsideration
 was pending, the BIR issued a Warrant of Garnishment
[18]
 against respondent 
Shell. Taking this as a denial of its request for reconsideration, 
respondent Shell likewise filed a Petition for Review
[19]
 before the CTA 
docketed as CTA Case No. 5728.



In their respective petitions before the CTA, respondents raised similar
 arguments against petitioner, to wit: (a) The collection of tax without
 prior assessment was a denial of the taxpayer's right to due process; 
(b) The use of TCCs as payment of excise tax liabilities was valid; (c) 
Since the BIR approved the transfers and subsequent use of the TCCs, it 
was estopped from questioning the validity thereof; and (d) The BIR's 
right to collect the alleged delinquent taxes had already prescribed.



The CTA granted respondents' petitions in separate Decisions both dated July 23, 1999, decreeing as follows:


CTA Case No. 5657



WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition for Review is 
hereby GRANTED. The collection of the alleged delinquent excise taxes in
 the amount of P1,107,542,547.08 is hereby CANCELLED AND SET ASIDE for 
being contrary to law. Accordingly, [herein petitioner and BIR Regional 
Director of Makati, Region No. 8] are ENJOINED from collecting the said 
amount of taxes against [herein respondent Petron].
[20]




CTA Case No. 5728



IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the instant petition for review is 
GRANTED. The collection letter issued by [herein petitioner] dated April
 22, 1998 is considered withdrawn and he is ENJOINED from any attempts 
to collect from [herein respondent Shell] the specific tax, surcharge 
and interest subject of this petition.
[21]
In both Decisions, the CTA upheld the validity of the TCC transfers from
 the BOI-registered export entities to respondents, the latter having 
complied with the requirements of transferability. The CTA further ruled
 that the BIR's attempt to collect taxes without an assessment was a 
denial of due process and a violation of Section 228
[22]
 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines of 1997 (Tax Code). The CTA 
also noted that the BIR might have purposely avoided the issuance of a 
for;mal assessment because its right to assess majority of respondents' 
alleged delinquent taxes had already prescribed.



Petitioner's motions for reconsideration of the above-mentioned 
decisions were denied by the CTA.
[23]
 Thus, petitioner CIR sought recourse before the
 Court of Appeals
[24]
 through the consolidated petitions docketed as 
CA-G.R. SP Nos. 55329-30.



However, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petitions and found the 
transfer and utilization of the subject TCCs were valid, in accordance 
with the 
2007 Shell Case
.
[25]
 The appellate court eventually 
denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.



Undaunted, petitioner CIR filed the present petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 204119-20.




B. 1999 Assessments (The 
2007 Shell Case
 and 
2010 Petron Case
)



During the pendency of the consolidated petitions in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 
55329-30 before the Court of Appeals, the DOF Center conducted separate 
post-audit procedures
[26]
 on all of the TCCs acquired and used by 
respondents during the Covered Years, requiring them to submit documents
 to support their acquisition of the TCCs from the BOI-registered export
 entities. As a result of its post-audit procedures, the DOF Center 
cancelled the first batch of the transferred TCCs
[27]
 used by respondent Shell and 
Petron, with aggregate amount of P830,560,791.00 and P284,390,845.00, 
respectively.



Following the cancellation of the TCCs, petitioner issued separate 
assessment letters to respondents in November 1999 (1999 Assessments) 
for the payment of deficiency excise taxes, surcharges, and interest for
 the Covered Years, which were also covered by the 1998 Collection 
Letters. Respondents filed their respective administrative protests 
against said assessments. While petitioner denied respondent Shell's 
protest, he did not act upon that of respondent Petron.




B.1 The 
2007 Shell Case



Respondent Shell raised petitioner's denial of its protest through a 
petition for review before the CTA, docketed as CTA Case No. 6003. The 
CTA Division rendered a Decision dated August 2, 2004 granting said 
petition and cancelled and set aside the assessment against respondent 
Shell; but then the CTA 
en banc
, in its Decision 
dated April 28, 2006, set aside the CTA Division's judgment and ordered 
respondent Shell to pay petitioner deficiency excise tax, surcharges, 
and interest. Hence, respondent Shell filed a petition for review before
 this Court docketed as G.R. No. 172598, the 
2007 Shell 
Case
.



In its Decision in the 
2007 Shell Case
, the Court 
cancelled the 1999 assessment against respondent Shell and disposed 
thus:


WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The April 28, 2006
 CTA 
En Banc
 Decision in CTA EB No. 64 is hereby 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the August 2, 2004 CTA Decision in CTA Case 
No. 6003 disallowing the assessment is hereby REINSTATED. The assessment
 of respondent for deficiency excise taxes against petitioner for 1992 
and 1994 to 1997 inclusive contained in the April 22, 1998 letter of 
respondent is cancelled and declared without force and effect for lack 
of legal basis. No pronouncement as to costs.
[28]
In nullifying petitioner's assessments, the Court upheld the TCCs' 
validity, respondent Shell's qualifications as transferees of said TCCs,
 respondent Shell's status as a transferee in good faith and for value, 
and respondent Shell's right to due process.

The 
2007 Shell Case
 became final and executory on 
March 17, 2008.
[29]




B.2 The 
2010 Petron Case



Considering petitioner's inaction on its protest, respondent Petron 
likewise filed a petition for review with the CTA, docketed as CTA Case
 No. 6136, to challenge the assessment. In a Decision dated August 23, 
2006, the CTA Division denied the petition and ordered respondent Petron
 to pay petitioner deficiency excise taxes, surcharges, and interest. 
Said judgment was subsequently affirmed by the CTA 
En 
Banc
 in. its Decision dated October 30, 2007. This prompted 
respondent Petron to seek relief from this Court through a petition for 
review, docketed as G.R. No. 180385, the 
2010 Petron 
Case
.
[30]



Citing the 
2007 Shell Case
, the Court similarly 
cancelled the 1999 assessment against respondent Petron and decided the 

2010 Petron Case
 as follows:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is 
GRANTED and the October 30, 2007 CTA 
En Banc
 Decision
 in CTA EB No. 238 is, accordingly, REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In lieu 
thereof, another is entered invalidating respondent's Assessment of 
petitioner's deficiency excise taxes for the years 1995 to 1997 for lack
 of legal bases. No pronouncement as to costs.
[31]
Entry of Judgment
[32]
 was made in the 
2010 Petron 
Case
 on November 2, 2010.




C. 2002 Collection Letter

    (G.R. No. 197945)



Meanwhile, during the pendency of respondent Shell's CTA Case No. 6003 
(which was eventually elevated to this Court in the 
2007 Shell 
Case
), the BIR requested respondent Shell to pay its purported
 excise tax liabilities amounting to P234,555,275.48, in a collection 
letter
[33]
 dated 
June 17, 2002 (2002 Collection Letter), which read:


Collection Letter



x x x x



Our records show that a letter dated January 30, 2002 was served to you 
by our Collection Service, for the collection of cancelled Tax Credit 
Certificates and Tax Debit Memos which were used to pay your 1995 to 
1998 excise tax liabilities. Said cancellation was embodied in EXCOM 
Resolution No. 03-05-99 of the Tax & Duty Drawback Center of the 
Department of Finance. Upon verification by this Office, however, some 
of these TCCs/TDMs were already included in the tax case previously 
filed in [the] Court of Tax Appeals. Accordingly, the collectible amount
 has been reduced from P691,508,005.82 to P234,555,275.48, the summary 
of which is hereto attached for your ready reference.

Basic

In view thereof, 
you are hereby requested to pay the aforesaid 
tax liability/ties within ten (10) days from receipt
 hereof 
thru any authorized agent bank x x x 
Should you fail to do so, 
this Office, much to our regret, will be constrained to enforce the 
collection of the said amount thru the 
summary administrative 
remedies provided by law
, without any further 
notice
. (Emphasis supplied.)
DOF Executive Committee Resolution No. 03-05-99 referred to in the 
aforequoted Collection Letter prescribed the guidelines and procedures 
for the cancellation, recall, and recovery of fraudulently-issued TCCs.



Respondent Shell filed on July 11, 2002 its administrative 
protest
[34]
 to the
 2002 Collection Letter. However, without resolving said protest, 
petitioner
[35]
 
issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 12, 2002 for 
the satisfaction of the following alleged tax delinquency of respondent 
Shell:


WHEREAS, THERE IS DUE FROM:



PILIPINAS SHELL PETROLEUM CORP. x x x x



The sum of TWO HUNDRED THIRTY[-]FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY[-]FIVE 
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY[-]FIVE PESOS AND 48 CENTAVOS as Internal 
Revenue Taxes shown hereunder, plus all increments incident to 
delinquency.

WHEREAS, the said taxpayer failed and refused and still fails and 
refuses to pay the same notwithstanding demands made by this Office.
[36]
Aggrieved, respondent Shell filed a petition for review
[37]
 before the CTA 
docketed as CTA Case No. 6547, arguing that: (a) the issuance of the 
2002 Collection Letter and Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy and 
enforcement of DOF Center's Executive Committee Resolution No. 03-05-99 
violated its right to due process; (b) The DOF Center did not have 
authority to cancel the TCCs; (c) The TCCs' transfers and utilizations 
were valid and legal; (d) It was an innocent purchaser for value; (e) 
The HIR was estopped from invalidating the transfer and utilization of 
the TCCs; and (f) The HIR's right to collect had already prescribed.



The CTA Second Division ruled in favor of respondent Shell in its 
Decision
[38]
 dated
 April 30, 2009:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition 
for Review is hereby GRANTED. The Collection Letters and Warrant of 
Distraint and/or Levy are CANCELLED and declared without force and 
effect for lack of legal basis.
[39]
After the CTA Division denied
[40]
 his motion for reconsideration, petitioner 
elevated the case to the CTA 
En Banc
 via a petition 
for review
[41]
 
docketed as CTA EB No. 535.



In its Decision dated February 22, 2011, the CTA 
En 
Banc
 denied the petition and affirmed the judgment of the CTA 
Division.



The CTA 
En Banc
 resolved the issues relying on the 

2007 Shell Case
. Pursuant to this ruling, the real 
issue is not whether the BOI-registered export entities validly procured
 the TCCs from the DOF Center, but whether respondent Shell fraudulently
 obtained the TCCs from said BOI-registered export entities.



The CTA 
En Banc
 brushed aside petitioner's argument 
that respondent Shell was aware that the transferred TCCs were subject 
to post-Â­audit procedures. It explained that the TCCs were valid and 
effective upon issuance and were not subject to post-audit procedures as
 a suspensive condition. Further, the TCCs could no longer be cancelled 
once these had been fully utilized or duly applied against any 
outstanding tax liability of an innocent transferee for value.



In this regard, the CTA 
En Banc
 found that respondent
 Shell did not participate in any fraud attending the issuance of the 
TCCs, as well as its subsequent transfers. Thus, respondent Shell is an 
innocent transferee in good faith and for value and could not be 
prejudiced by fraud attending the TCCs' procurement.



In the absence of fraud, petitioner could only reassess Shell for 
deficiency tax within the three-year prescriptive period under Section 
203 of the Tax Code, not the 10-year period under Section 222(a) of the 
same Code. Further, petitioner violated respondent Shell's right to due 
process when he issued the 2002 Collection Letter without a Notice of 
Informal Conference (NIC) or a Preliminary Assessment Notice as required
 by Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 12-99.



The CIR moved for reconsideration but was denied.



Hence, petitioner now comes before this Court citing in the petitions at
 bar the following errors allegedly committed by the courts 
a 
quo
 in G.R. Nos. 204119-20 and G.R. No. 197945:




G.R. Nos. 204119-20



The Court of Appeals erred:


I.



IN NOT HOLDING THAT RESPONDENTS SHELL AND PETRON WERE NOT QUALIFIED 
TRANSFEREES OF THE TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATES (TCCs) SINCE THEY WERE NOT 
SUPPLIERS OF DOMESTIC CAPITAL EQUIPMENT OR OF RAW MATERIAL AND/OR 
COMPONENTS TO THEIR TRANSFERORS.




II.



IN NOT HOLDING THAT SINCE RESPONDENTS WERE NOT QUALIFIED TRANSFEREES OF 
THE TCCs, THE SAME COULD NOT BE VALIDLY USED IN PAYING THEIR EXCISE TAX 
LIABILITIES.




III.



IN NOT HOLDING THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT ESTOPPED FROM COLLECTING TAXES DUE TO THE MISTAKES OF ITS AGENTS.




IV.



IN NOT HOLDING THAT SHELL WAS ACCORDED DUE PROCESS IN PETITIONER'S 
ATTEMPT TO COLLECT ITS EXCISE TAX LIABILITIES.

I. The CTA 
EN BANC
 COMMITTED GRIEVOUS ERROR IN NOT 
RULING ON THE VALIDITY OF THE TCCs AND ITS CONSEQUENT EFFECTS ON THE 
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED BY RESPONDENT.



II. THE CTA

HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT IS AN INNOCENT TRANSFEREE OF THE DISPUTED TCCs 
IN GOOD FAITH.



III. THE CTA

IV. THE CTA 
EN BANC
 COMMITTED GRIEVOUS ERROR IN 
HOLDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ESTOPPED FROM NULLIFYING THE TCCs, AND 
DECLARING THEIR USE, TRANSFER AND UTILIZATION AS FRAUDULENT.



V. THE CTA 
EN BANC
 COMMITTED GRIEVOUS ERROR IN RULING THAT RESPONDENT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS.



VI. THE CTA 
EN BANC
 COMMITTED A GRIEVOUS ERROR IN 
DECLARING THAT THE PERIOD TO COLLECT RESPONDENT'S UNPAID EXCISE TAXES 
HAS ALREADY PRESCRIBED.



VII. THE CTA 
EN BANC
 COMMITTED A GRIEVOUS ERROR IN 
RULING THAT,RESPONDENT IS NOT LIABLE TO PAY SURCHARGES AND

[43]
The Ruling of the Court



The petitions are without merit.




The issues concerning the transferred TCCs' validity, 
respondents' qualifications as transferees of said TCCs, and the 
respondents' valid use of the TCCs to pay for their excise tax 
liabilities for the Covered Years had been finally settled in the 2007 
Shell Case and 2010 Petron Case and are already barred from being 
re-litigated herein by the doctrine of 
res judicata
 
in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment.



While the present petitions, on one hand, and the 
2007 Shell 
Case
 and 
2010 Petron Case
, on the other 
hand, involve identical parties and originate from the same factual 
antecedents, there are also substantial distinctions between these 
cases, for which reason, the Court cannot simply dismiss the former on 
account of the latter based on the doctrine of 
res 
judicata
 in the concept of "barby prior judgment."



The 
2007 Shell Case
 and 
2010 Petron 
Case
 were assessment cases. These initiated from respondents' 
protests of the 
1999 Assessments
 issued by petitioner
 CIR against them for deficiency excise taxes, surcharges, and interest,
 following cancellation of the transferred TCCs and the corresponding 
TDMs which respondents used to pay for said excise taxes. Said cases 
were primarily concerned with the legality and propriety of petitioner's
 issuance of the 1999 Assessments against respondents.



In contrast, the consolidated petitions now before the Court arose from 
respondents' protests of petitioner's 
1998 and 2002 Collection 
Letters
 for essentially the same excise tax deficiencies 
covered by the 1999



Assessments, but apparently issued and pursued by the petitioner and BIR
 separately from and concurrently with the assessment cases. At the crux
 of these cases is petitioner's right to collect the deficiency excise 
taxes from respondents.



In the instant petitions, petitioner asserts his right to collect as 
excise tax deficiencies the excise tax liabilities which respondents had
 previously settled using the transferred TCCs, impugning the TCCs' 
validity on account of fraud as well as respondents' qualifications as 
transferees of said TCCs. However, respondents already raised the same 
arguments and the Court definitively ruled thereon in its final and 
executory decisions in the 
2007 Shell Case
 and 

2010 Petron Case
.



The re-litigation of these issues in the present petitions, when said 
issues had already been settled with finality in the 
2007 Shell
 Case
 and 
2010 Petron Case
, is precluded by
 
res judicata
 in the concept of "conclusiveness of 
judgment."



In 
Ocho v. Calos
,
[44]
 the Court extensively explained the doctrine of
 
res judicata
 in the concept of "conclusiveness of 
judgment," thus:


The doctrine of 
res judicata
 as 
embodied in Section 47, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court states:


SECTION 47. 
Effect of judgments or final 
orders
. - The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a
 court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronom:tce the 
judgment or final order, may be as follows:



x x x x



(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the 
matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been 
raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their 
successors-inÂ­ interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the 
action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under 
the same title and in the same capacity; and



(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their 
successors-in-interest, that only is deemed. to have been adjudged in a 
former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been 
so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or 
necessary thereto.
It must be pointed out at this point that, contrary to the insistence of
 the Caloses, the doctrine of 
res judicata
 applies to
 both judicial and quasi-judiCial proceedings. The doctrine actually 
embraces two (2) concepts: the first is "bar by prior judgment" under 
paragraph (b) of Rule 39, Section 47, and the second is 
"
conclusiveness of judgment
" 
under paragraph
 (c)
 thereof. In the present case, the second concept - 
conclusiveness of judgment- applies. The said concept is explained in 
this manner:


[A] fact or question which was in issue in a 
former suit and was there judicially passed upon and determined by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusively settled by the judgment
 therein as far as the parties to that action and persons in privity 
with them are concerned and cannot be again litigated in any future 
action between such parties or their privies, in the same court or any 
other court of concurrent jurisdiction on either the same or different 
cause of action, while the judgment remains unreversed by proper 
authority.
 It has been held that in order. that a judgment in 
one action can be conclusive as to a particular matter in another action
 between the same parties or their privies, 
it is essential 
that the issue be identical
. If a particular point or question
 is in issue in the second action, and the judgment will depend on the 
determination of that particular point or question, a former judgment 
between the same parties or their privies will be 
final and 
conclusive
 in the second if that same point or question was in
 issue and adjudicated in the first suit. x x x.
Although the action instituted by the Caloses in Adm. Case No. 006-90 
(Anomalies/Irregularities in OLT Transfer Action and Other Related 
Activities) is different from the action in Adm. Case No. (X)-014 
(Annulment of Deeds of Assignment, Emancipation Patents and Transfer 
Certificate of Titles, Retention and Recovery of Possession and 
Ownership), the concept of conclusiveness of judgment still applies 
because under this principle "
the identity of causes of action 
is not required but merely identity of issues
."



[Simply] put, 
conclusiveness of judgment bars the relitigation 
of particular facts or issues in another litigation between the same 
parties on a different claim or cause of action
. In 

Lopez vs. Reyes
, we expounded on the concept of 
conclusiveness of judgment as follows:


The general rule precluding the relitigation of 
material facts or questions which were in issue and adjudicated in 
former action are commonly applied to all matters essentially connected 
with the subject matter of litigation. Thus it extends to questions 
necessarily involved in an issue, and necessarily adjudicated, or 
necessarily implied in the final judgment, although no specific finding 
may have been made in reference thereto, and although such matters were 
directly referred to in the pleadings and were not actually or formally 
presented. Under this rule, if the record of the former trial shows that
 the judgment could not have been rendered without deciding the 
particular matter, it will be considered as having settled that matter 
as to all future actions between the parties, and if a judgment 
necessarily presupposes certain premises, they are as conclusive as the 
judgment itself. Reasons for the rule are that a judgment is an 
adjudication on all the matters which are essential to support it, and 
that every proposition assumed or decided by the court leading up to the
 final conclusion upon which such conclusion is based is as effectually 
passed upon as the ultimate question which is solved.



x x x x
As held in 
Legarda vs. Savellano
:


x x x It is a general rule common to all civilized 
system of jurisprudence, that the solemn and deliberate sentence of the 
law, pronounced by its appointed organs, upon a disputed fact or a state
 of facts, should be regarded as a final and conclusive determination of
 the question litigated, and should forever set the controversy at rest.
 Indeed, it has been well said that this maxim is more than a mere rule 
of law; more even than an important principle of public policy; and that
 it is not too much to say that it is a fundamental concept in the 
organization of every jural system. Public policy and sound practice 
demand that, at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts 
should become final at some definite date fixed by law. The very object 
for which courts were constituted was to put an end to 
controversies.
The findings of the Hearing Officer in Adm. Case No. 006-90, which had 
long attained finality, that petitioner is not the owner of other 
agricultural lands foreclosed any inquiry on the same issue involving 
the same parties and property. The CA thus erred in still making a 
finding that petitioner is not qualified to be a farmer-beneficiary 
because he owns other agricultural lands. (Emphases supplied, citations 
omitted.)
In the 
2007 Shell Case
, the Court affirmed the 
validity of the TCCs, the transfer of the TCCs to respondent Shell, and 
the use of the transfe ed TCCs by respondent Shell to partly pay for its
 excise tax liabilities for the Covered Years. The Court ratiocinated as
 follows: 
First
, the results of 
postÂ­audit procedures conducted in connection with the TCCs should not 
operate as a suspensive condition to the TCCs' validity. 

Second
, while it was one of the 
conditions appearing on the face of the TCCs, the post-audit 
contemplated therein did not pertain to the TCCs' genuineness or 
validity, but to computational discrepancies that might have resulted 
from their utilization and transfer. 

Third
, the DOF Center or DOF could
 not compel respondent Shell to submit sales documents for the purported
 post-audit. As a BOI-registered enterprise, respondent Shell was a 
qualified transferee of the subject TCCs, pursuant to existing rules and
 regulations.
[45]


Fourth
, respondent Shell was a 
transferee in good faith and for value as it secured the necessary 
approvals from various government agencies before it used and applied 
the transferred TCCs against its tax liabilities and it did not 
participate in the perpetuation of fraudulent acts in the procurement of
 the said TCCs. As a transferee in good faith, respondent Shell could 
not be prejudiced with a re-assessment of excise tax liabilities it had
 already settled when due using the subject TCCs nor by any fraud 
attending the procurement of the subject TCCs. 

Fifth
, while the DOF Center was 
authorized to cancel TCCs it might have erroneously issued, it could no 
longer exercise such authority after the subject TCCs have already been 
utilized and accepted as payment for respondent Shell's excise tax 
liabilities. What had been used up, debited, and cancelled could no 
longer be voided and cancelled anew. While the State was not estopped by
 the neglect or omission of its agents, this principle could not be 
applied to the prejudice of an innocent transferee in good faith and for
 value.



And 
finally
, the Court found in 
the 
2007 Shell Case
 that respondent Shell's right to 
due process was violated. Petitioner did not issue a Notice of Informal 
Conference (NIC) and Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) to respondent 
Shell, in violation of the formal assessment procedure required by 
Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 12-99.
[46]
 Petitioner merely relied on the DOF Center's 
findings supporting the cancellation of respondent Shell's TCCs. Thus, 
the Court voided the assessment dated November 15, 1999 issued by the 
CIR against herein respondent Shell.



On the other hand, the Court resolved the 
2010 Petron 
Case
 in accordance with its ruling in the 
2007 Shell 
Case
, reiterating that: 

First
, the subject TCCs' validity 
and effectivity should be immediate and should not be dependent on the 
outcome of a post-audit as a suspensive condition. 

Second
, respondent Petron could 
not be prejudiced by fraud alleged to have attended such issuance as it 
was not privy to the issuance of the subject TCCs and it had already 
used said TCCs in settling its tax liabilities. 

Third
, respondent Petron was also 
an innocent transferee in good faith and for value because it was a 
qualified transferee of the TCCs based on existing rules and regulations
 and the TCCs' transfers were approved by the appropriate government 
agencies. And 
fourth
, while the 
government cannot be estopped from collecting taxes by the mistake, 
negligence, or omission of its agents, the rights of a transferee in 
good faith and for value should be protected.



The Court's aforementioned findings in the 
2007 Shell 
Case
 and 
2010 Petron Case
 are conclusive 
and binding upon this Court in the petitions at bar. 
Res 
judicata
 by conclusiveness of judgment bars the Court from 
reÂ­litigating the issues on the TCCs' validity and respondents' 
qualifications as transferees in these cases. As a result of such 
findings in the 
2007 Shell Case
 and 
2010 
Petron Case
, then respondents could not have had excise tax 
deficiencies for the Covered Years as they had validly paid for and 
settled their excise tax liabilities using the transferred TCCs.




In any case, the present petitions are dismissed as 
petitioner violated respondents' right to due process for failing to 
observe the prescribed procedure for collection of unpaid taxes through 
summary administrative remedies.



The Court dismisses the present petitions for it cannot allow petitioner
 to collect any excise tax deficiency from respondents by mere issuance 
of the 1998 and 2002 Collection Letters. Petitioner had failed to comply
 with the prescribed procedure for collection of unpaid taxes through 
summary administrative remedies and, thus, violated respondents' right 
to due process.

That taxation is an essential attribute of sovereignty and the lifeblood
 of every nation are doctrines well-entrenched in our jurisdiction. 
Taxes are the government's primary means to generate funds needed to 
fulfill its mandate of promoting the general welfare and well-being of 
the people
[47]
 and
 so should be collected without unnecessary hindrance.
[48]



While taxation 
per se
 is generally legislative in 
nature, collection of tax is administrative in character.
[49]
 Thus, Congress 
delegated the assessment and collection of all national internal revenue
 taxes, fees, and charges to the BIR.
[50]
 And as the BIR's chief, the CIR has the power 
to make assessments and prescribe additional requirements for tax 
administration and enforcement.
[51]



The Tax Code provides two types of remedies to enforce the collection of
 unpaid taxes, to wit: (a) 
summary administrative 
remedies
, such as the distraint and/or levy of 
taxpayer's property;
[52]
 and/or (b) 
judicial 
remedies
, such as the filing of a criminal or civil 
action against the erring taxpayer.
[53]



Verily, pursuant to the lifeblood doctrine, the Court has allowed tax 
authorities ample discretion to avail themselves of the most expeditious
 way to collect the taxes,
[54]
 
including summary processes
,
 with as little interference as possible.
[55]
 However, the Court, at the same time, has 
not hesitated to strike down these processes in cases wherein tax 
authorities disregarded due process.
[56]
 The BIR's power to collect taxes must yield to 
the fundamental rule that no person shall be deprived of his/her 
property without due process of law.
[57]
 
The rule is that taxes must be 
collected reasonably and in accordance with the prescribed 
procedure.
[58]



In the normal course of tax administration and enforcement, the BIR must
 first make an 
assessment
 then enforce the 

collection
 of the amounts so assessed. "An assessment
 is not an action or proceeding for the collection of taxes. x x x It is
 
a step preliminary, but essential
 to warrant 
distraint, if still feasible, and, also, to establish a cause for 
judicial action."
[59]
 The BIR may summarily enforce collection only 
when it has accorded the taxpayer 
administrative due 
process
, which vitally includes the issuance of a valid 
assessment.
[60]
 A 
valid assessment sufficiently informs the taxpayer in writing of the 
legal and factual bases of the said assessment, thereby allowing the 
taxpayer to effectively protest the assessment and adduce supporting 
evidence in its behalf.



In 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Reyes
[61]
 (
Reyes 
Case
), the petitioner issued an assessment notice and a demand
 letter for alleged deficiency estate tax against the taxpayer estate. 
The assessment notice and demand letter. simply notified the taxpayer 
estate of petitioner's findings, without stating the factual and legal 
bases for said assessment. The Court, absent a valid assessment, refused
 to accord validity and effect to petitioner's collection efforts - 
which involved, among other things, the successive issuances of a 
collection letter, a final notice before seizure, and a warrant of 
distraint and/or levy against the taxpayer estate - and declared that:


x x x [P]etitioner violated the cardinal rule in 
administrative law that the taxpayer be accorded due process. Not only 
was the law here disregarded, but no valid notice was sent, either. A 
void assessment bears no valid fruit.




The law imposes a substantive, not merely a formal, 
requirement. To proceed heedlessly with tax collection without first 
establishing a valid assessment is evidently violative of the cardinal 
principle in administrative investigations: that taxpayers should be able
 to present their case and adduce supporting evidence.
 In the 
instant case, respondent has not been informed of the basis of the 
estate tax liability. Without complying with the unequivocal mandate of 
first informing the taxpayer of the government's claim, there can be no 
deprivation of property, because no effective protest can be made. The 
haphazard shot at slapping an assessment, supposedly based on estate 
taxation's general provisions that are expected to be known by the 
taxpayer, is utter chicanery.



Even a cursory review of the preliminary assessment notice, as well as 
the demand letter sent, reveals the lack of basis for - not to mention 
the insufficiency of - the gross figures and details of the itemized 
deductions indicated in the notice and the letter. This Court cannot 
countenance an assessment based on estimates that appear to have been 
arbitrarily or capriciously arrived at. Although taxes are the lifeblood
 of the government, their assessment and collection "should be made in 
accordance with law as any arbitrariness will negate the very reason for
 government itself."
[62]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
The Court similarly found that there was no valid assessment in 

Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. BASF Coating + Inks Phils.,
 Inc.
[63]
 (
BASF Coating Case
) as the 
assessment notice therein was sent to the taxpayer company's former 
address. Without a valid assessment, the Court pronounced that 
petitioner's issuance of a First Notice Before Issuance of Warrant of 
Distraint and Levy to be in violation of the taxpayer company's right to
 due process and effectively blocked any further efforts by petitioner 
to collect by virtue thereof. The Court ratiocinated that:


It might not also be amiss to point out that 
petitioner's issuance of the First Notice Before Issuance of Warrant of 
Distraint and Levy violated respondent's right to due process because no
 valid notice of assessment was sent to it. An invalid assessment bears 
no valid fruit. The law imposes a substantive, not merely a formal, 
requirement. To proceed heedlessly with tax collection without first 
establishing a valid assessment is evidently violative of the cardinal 
principle in administrative investigations: that taxpayers should be 
able to present their case and adduce supporting evidence. In the 
instant case, respondent has not properly been informed of the basis of 
its tax liabilities. Without complying with the unequivocal mandate of 
first informing the taxpayer of the government's claim, there can be no 
deprivation of property, because no effective protest can be made.



x x x x



It is an elementary rule enshrined in the 1987 Constitution that no 
person shall be deprived of property without due process of law. In 
balancing the scales between the power of the State to tax and its 
inherent right to prosecute perceived transgressors of the law on one 
side, and the constitutional rights of a citizen to due process of law 
and the equal protection of the laws on the other, the scales must tilt 
in favor of the individual, for a citizen's right is amply protected by 
the Bill of Rights under the Constitution.
[64]
It is worthy to note that in the 
Reyes Case and BASF Coating 
Case
, there were assessments actually issued against the 
taxpayers therein, except that said assessments were adjudged invalid 
for different reasons (
i.e.
, for failing to state the
 factual and legal bases for the assessment in the 
Reyes 
Case
 and for sending the assessment to the wrong address in 
the 
BASF Coating Case
). In the instant cases, 
petitioner did not issue at all an assessment against respondents prior 
to his issuance of the 1998 and 2002 Collection Letters. Thus, there is 
even more reason for the Court to bar petitioner's attempts to collect 
the alleged deficiency excise taxes through any summary administrative 
remedy.



In the present case, it is clear from the wording of the 1998 and 2002 
Collection Letters that petitioner intended to pursue, through said 
collection letters, 
summary administrative remedies
 
for the collection of respondents' alleged excise tax deficiencies for 
the Covered Years. In fact, in the respondent Shell's case, the 
collection letters were already followed by the BIR's issuance of 
Warrants of Garnishment and Distraint and/or Levy against it.



That the BIR proceeded with the collection of respondents' alleged 
unpaid taxes 
without a previous valid assessment
 is 
evident from the following: 
First
,
 petitioner admitted in CTA Case Nos. 5728
[65]
 and 6547 that: (a) the collections letters 
were not tax assessment notices; (b) the letters were issued solely 
based on the DOF Center's findings; and (c) the BIR never issued any 
preliminary assessment notice prior to the issuance of the collection 
letters. 
Second
, although the 1998
 and 2002 Collection Letters and the 1999 Assessments against 
respondents were for the same excise taxes for the Covered Years, the 
former were evidently not based on the latter. The 1998 Collection 
Letters against respondents were issued prior to the 1999 Assessments; 
while the 2002 Collection Letter against respondent Shell was issued 
even while respondent Shell's protest of the 1999 Assessment was still 
pending before the CTA. And 
third
,
 assuming 
arguendo
 that the 1998 and 2002 Collection 
Letters were intended to implement the 1999 Assessments against 
respondents, the 1999 Assessments were already nullified in the 

2007 Shell Case
 and 
2010 Petron 
Case
.



Absent a previously issued assessment supporting the 1998 and 2002 
Collection Letters, it is clear that petitioner's attempts to collect 
through said collection letters as well as the subsequent Warrants of 
Garnishment and Distraint and/or Levy are void and ineffectual. If an 
invalid assessment bears no valid fruit, with more reason will no such 
fruit arise if there was no assessment in the first place.


The period for petitioner to collect the alleged 
deficiency excise taxes from respondents through judicial remedies had 
already prescribed.



After establishing that petitioner could not collect respondents' 
alleged deficiency excise taxes for the covered years through summary 
administrative remedies without a valid assessment, the Court next 
determines whether petitioner could still resort to judicial remedies to
 enforce collection.



The Court answers in the negative as the period for collection oÂ£ the 
respondents' alleged deficiency excise taxes for the Covered Years 
through judicial remedies had already prescribed.



The alleged deficiency excise taxes petitioner seeks to collect from 
respondents in the cases at bar pertain to the Covered Years, 

i.e.
, 1992 to 1997, during which, the National 
Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines of 1977
[66]
 (1977 NIRC) was the governing law. 
Pertinent provisions of the 1977 NIRC read:


Sec. 318. 
Period of Limitation Upon 
Assessment and Collection
. - Except as provided in the 
succeeding section, internal-revenue taxes shall be assessed 

within five years
 after the return was filed, and 

no proceeding in court 
without assessment
 
for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of 
such period
. For the purposes of this section, a return filed 
before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof shall be 
considered as filed on such last day: 
Provided
, That 
this limitation shall not apply to cases already investigated prior to 
the approval of this Code. (Emphasis Supplied)



Sec. 319. 
Exceptions as to period of limitation of assessment 
and collection of taxes
. - (a) In the case of a false or 
fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of a failure to file a 
return, the tax may be assessed, or a 
proceeding in court for 
the collection of such tax may be begun 
without 
assessment
, at any time within ten years after the discovery 
of the falsity, fraud, or omission:


Provided
, That in a fraud assessment which has become
 final and executory, the fact of fraud shall be judicially taken 
cognizance of in the civil or criminal action for the collection 
thereof.



(b) Where before the expiration of the time prescribed in the preceding 
section for the assessment of the tax, both the Commissioner and the 
taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, 
the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the 
period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by 
subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the 
period previously agreed upon.



(c) Where the assessment of any internal revenue tax has been made 
within the period of limitation above-prescribed, such tax may be 
collected by distraint or levy or by a proceeding in court, but only if 
began (1) within five years after assessment of the tax, or (2) prior to
 the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by 
the Commissioner and the taxpayer before the expiration of such 
five-year period. The period so agreed upon may be extended by 
subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the 
period previously agreed upon.
Under Section 318 of the 1977 NIRC, petitioner had five years
[67]
 from the time 
respondents filed their excise tax returns in question to: (a) issue an 
assessment; and/or (b) file a court action for collection without an 
assessment. In the petitions at bar, respondents filed their returns for
 the Covered Years from 1992 to 1997, and the five-year prescriptive 
period under Section 319 of the 1977 NIRC would have prescribed 
accordingly from 1997 to 2002.



As the Court has explicitly found herein as well as in the 
2007
 Shell Case
 and 
2010 Petron Case
, 
petitioner failed to issue any valid assessment against respondents for 
the latter's alleged deficiency excise taxes for the Covered Years. 
Without a valid assessment, the five-year prescriptive period 

to assess
 continued to run and had, in fact, expired 
in these cases. Irrefragably, petitioner is already barred by 
prescription from issuing an assessment against respondents for 
deficiency excise taxes for the Covered Years. Resultantly, this also 
bars petitioner from undertaking any 
summary administrative 
remedies
, 
i.e.
, distraint and/or levy, 
against respondents for collection of the same taxes.



Unlike summary administrative remedies, 
the government's power 
to enforce the collection through judicial action is not conditioned 
upon a previous valid assessment
. Sections 318 and 319(a) of 
the 1977 NIRC expressly allowed the institution of court proceedings for
 collection of taxes without assessment within five years from the 
filing of the tax return and 10 years from the discovery of falsity, 
fraud, or omission, respectively.
[68]

A judicial action for the collection of a tax is begun: (a) by the 

filing of a complaint
 with the court of competent 
jurisdiction, or (b) where the assessment is appealed to the Court of 
Tax Appeals, by 
filing an answer to the taxpayer's petition for
 review
 wherein payment of the tax is prayed for.
[69]



From respondents' filing of their excise tax returns in the years 1992 
to 1997 until the lapse of the five-year prescriptive period under 
Section 318 of the 1977 NIRC in the years 1997 to 2002, 

petitioner did not institute any judicial action for collection
 of tax
 as aforedescribed. Instead, petitioner relied solely 
on summary administrative remedies by issuing the collection letters and
 warrants of garnishment and distraint and/or levy without prior 
assessment against respondents. Sifting through records, it can be said 
that petitioner's earliest attempts to 
judicially
 
enforce collection of respondents' alleged deficiency excise taxes were 
his 
Answers
 to respondents' Petitions for Review 
filed before the CTA in Case Nos. 5657, 5728, and 6547 on August 6, 
1998,
[70]
 March 2,
 1999,
[71]
 and 
November 29, 2002,
[72]
 respectively.



Verily, in a long line of jurisprudence, the Court deemed the filing of 
such pleadings as effective tax collection suits so as to stop the 
running of the prescriptive period in cases where: (a) the CIR issued an
 assessment and the taxpayer appealed the same to the CTA;
[73]
 (b) the CIR filed the
 answer praying for the payment of tax within five years after the 
issuance of the assessment;
[74]
 and (c) at the time of its filing, jurisdiction
 over judicial actions for collection of internal revenue taxes was 
vested in the CTA, not in the regular courts.
[75]



However, judging by the foregoing conditions, even petitioner's Answers 
in CTA Case Nos. 5657, 5728, and 6547 cannot be deemed judicial actions 
for collection of tax. 
First
, CTA 
Case Nos. 5657, 5728, and 6547 were not appeals of assessments. 
Respondents went before the CTA to challenge the 1998 and 2002 
Collection Letters, which, by petitioner's own admission, are not 
assessments. 
Second
, by the time 
petitioner filed. his Answers before the CTA on August 6, 1998, March 2,
 1999, and November 29, 2002, his power to collect alleged deficiency 
excise taxes, the returns for which were filed from 1992 to 1997, had 
already partially prescribed, particularly those pertaining to the 
earlier portion of the Covered Years. 

Third
, at the time petitioner 
filed his Answers before the CTA, the jurisdiction over judicial actions
 for collection of internal revenue taxes was vested in the regular 
courts, not the CTA.
[76]
 Original jurisdiction over collection 
cases
[77]
 was 
transferred to the CTA only on April 23, 2004, upon the effectivity of 
Republic Act No. 9282.
[78]



Without either a 
formal tax collection suit
 filed 
before the court of competent jurisdiction or an 

answer
 deemed as a judicial action for collection of 
tax within the prescribed five-year period under Section 318 of the 1977
 NIRC, petitioner's 
power to institute a court proceeding for 
the collection of respondents' alleged deficiency excise taxes without 
an assessment had already prescribed
 in 1997 to 2002.



The Court's ruling remains the same even if the 10-year prescriptive 
period under Section 319(a) of the 1977 NIRC, in case of falsity, fraud,
 or omission in the taxpayer's return, is applied to the present cases.



Even if the Court concedes, for the sake of argument, that respondents' 
returns for the Covered Years were false or fraudulent, Section 319(a) 
of the 1977 NIRC similarly required petitioner to (a) issue an 
assessment; and/or (b) file a court action for collection without an 
assessment, but within 10 years after the discovery of the falsity, 
fraud, or omission in the taxpayer's return. As early as the 1998 
Collection Letters, petitioner could already be charged with knowledge 
of the alleged falsity or fraud in respondents' excise tax returns, 
which precisely led petitioner to invalidate respondents' payments using
 the transferred TCCs and to demand payment of deficiency excise taxes 
through said letters. The 10-year prescriptive period under Section 
319(a) of the 1977 NIRC wholly expired in 2008 without petitioner 
issuing a valid assessment or instituting judicial action for 
collection.



The Court cannot countenance the tax authorities' non-performance of 
their duties in the present cases. The law provides for a statute of 
limitations on the assessment and collection of internal revenue taxes 
in order to safeguard the interest of the taxpayer against unreasonable 
investigation.
[79]



While taxes are the lifeblood of the nation, the Court cannot allow tax 
authorities indefinite periods to assess and/or collect alleged unpaid 
taxes. Certainly, it is an injustice to leave any taxpayer in perpetual 
uncertainty whether he will be made liable for deficiency or delinquent 
taxes.



In sum, petitioner's attempts to collect the alleged deficiency excise 
taxes from respondents are void and ineffectual because (a) the Issues 
regarding the transferred TCCs' validity, respondents' qualifications as
 transferees of said TCCs, and respondents' use of the TCCs to pay for 
their excise tax liabilities for the Covered Years, had already been

 and 

2010 Petron Case
, and could no longer be re-litigated
 on the ground of 
res judicata
 in the concept of 
conclusiveness of judgment; (b) petitioner's resort to summary 
administrative remedies without a valid assessment was not in accordance
 with the prescribed procedure and was in violation of respondents' 
right to substantive due process; and (c) none of petitioner's 
collection efforts constitute a valid institution of a judicial remedy 
for collection of taxes without an assessment, and any such judicial 
remedy is now barred by prescription.

 Section 318 
of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977 (Presidential Decree No. 
1158, [June 3, 1977]) was previously Section 331 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (Commonwealth Act No. 466, [June 15, 
1939]).




[67]
 Section 318 
was amended by Republic Act No. 8424, shortening the prescriptive period
 to assess and collect national internal revenue taxes from five to 
three years, to quote: "SECTION 203. 
Period of Limitation Upon 
Assessment and Collection
. - Except as provided in Section 
222, internal revenue taxes shall be assessed 
within three (3) 
years
 after the last day prescribed by law for the filing of 
the return, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the 
collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such 
period: Provided, That in a case where a return is filed beyond the 
period prescribed by law, the three (3)-year period shall be counted 
from the day the return was filed. For purposes of this Section, a 
return filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing 
thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day." (Emphasis 
supplied.)




[68]
 In case an 
assessment had been timely issued, Section 319(c) of the 1977 NIRC 
provided: "Where the assessment of any internal revenue tax has been 
made within the period of limitation aboveÂ­prescribed, such tax may be 
collected by distraint or levy or by a proceeding in court, but only if 
began (1) within five years after assessment of the tax, or (2) prior to
 the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by 
the Commissioner and the taxpayer before the expiration of such 
five-year period. x x x"
