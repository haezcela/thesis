PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Before the Court is an ordinary appeal
[1]
 filed by accused-appellant Patricia Cabrellos 
y
 Dela Cruz (Cabrellos) assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated September 13, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR H.C. No. 02020, which affirmed the Joint Judgment
[3]
 dated February 25, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court of Bais City, Negros Oriental, Branch 45 (RTC) in Crim. Case Nos. 05-0163-A and 05-0162-A finding Cabrellos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, respectively, of Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,
[4]
 otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."
 
The Facts
 
 This case stemmed from two (2) Informations
[5]
 filed before the RTC charging Cabrellos with violations of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165, the accusatory portions of which read: 
 
 
Crim. Case No. 05-0163-A
 
 That on September 22, 2005 at about 12:45 in the afternoon at Barangay Iniban, Ayungon, Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, without lawful authority, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously SELL and DELIVER to a poseur buyer Methamphetamine Hydrochloride locally known as 
Shabu
, weighing 0.08 gram, a dangerous drug.
 
 Contrary to law.
[6]
 
 
Crim. Case No. 05-0162-A
 
 
That on September 22, 2005 at 12:45 in the afternoon, more or less, at Barangay Iniban, Ayungon, Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in her possession, control and custody, 0.64 gram of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, locally known as 
Shabu
, a dangerous drug, without lawful authority. 
 
Contrary to law.
[7]
 
 
 
 The prosecution alleged that on September 22, 2005 and acting upon a tip from a confidential informant regarding Cabrellos's alleged illegal drug activities in Ayungon, Negros Oriental, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Provincial Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Group organized a buy-bust team, with PO3 Allen June Germodo (PO3 Germodo) acting as poseur-buyer and PO2 Glenn Corsame (PO2 Corsame) as immediate back-up. The buy-bust team, together with the informant, then went to Cabrellos's house. Thereat, the informant introduced PO3 Germodo as a 
shabu
 buyer. After PO3 Germodo gave Cabrellos the two (2) marked P500.00 bills, Cabrellos took out two (2) plastic sachets containing suspected 
shabu
 from her bag and handed it over to PO3 Germodo. Upon receipt of the sachets, PO3 Germodo placed Cabrellos under arrest, with the rest of the buy-bust team rushing to the scene. The police officers searched Cabrellos's bag and discovered seventeen (17) more sachets containing suspected 
shabu
 therein. The police officers then brought Cabrellos and the seized items to the Ayungon Police Station for the conduct of photography and inventory of the seized items. However, since only a barangay
 kagawad
 was present at the Ayungon Police Station at that time, the police officers brought Cabrellos and the seized items to the Dumaguete Police Station wherein they conducted a second inventory, this time in the presence of a representative each from the DOJ and the media. Thereafter, the seized sachets were brought to the crime laboratory where the contents thereof were confirmed to be methamphetamine hydrochloride or 
shabu
.
[8]
 
 In her defense, Cabrellos testified that she was inside her house tending to her child when suddenly, two (2) unidentified persons came into their house looking for her husband. When she told them that her husband was not around, she was brought to the police station for selling 
shabu
, and there, made to sign a document already signed by a barangay official. She was detained for three (3) months at the Dumaguete Police Station before she was transferred to Bais City Jail.
[9]
 
The RTC Ruling
 
 In a Joint Judgment
[10]
 dated February 25, 2015, the RTC convicted Cabrellos of the crimes charged, and accordingly, sentenced her as follows: (
a
) in Criminal Case No. 05-0163-A, to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, and to pay a fine of P500,000.00; and (
b
) in Criminal Case No. 05-0162-A, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years, and to pay a fine of P300,000.00.
[11]
 
The RTC found that the prosecution was able to establish Cabrellos's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, considering that: (a) she was caught in 
flagrante delicto
 selling 
shabu
 to the poseur-buyer; and (b) in the search incidental to her arrest, she was discovered to be in possession of seventeen (17) more sachets of 
shabu
. On the other hand, it did not give credence to Cabrellos' bare denial as it stood weak in the face of the detailed and candid testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses.
[12]
 
 Aggrieved, Cabrellos appealed
[13]
 to the CA. 
The CA Ruling
 
 In a Decision 
[14]
 dated September 13, 2016, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling.
[15]
 It held that the testimonies of the police officers had established the fact that Cabrellos was caught in the act of selling illegal drugs, and that in the course of her arrest, she was found in possession of more sachets containing illegal drugs. In this regard, the CA ruled that the police officers substantially complied with the chain of custody requirement as the identity and evidentiary value of the seized items were duly established and preserved. 
[16]
 
Hence, this appeal. 
The Issue Before the Court
 
 The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Cabrellos is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. 
The Court's Ruling
 
 The appeal is meritorious. 
At the outset, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review and, thus, it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.
[17]
 "The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."
[18]
 
In this case, Cabrellos was charged with Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. In order to properly secure the conviction of an accused charged with Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, the prosecution must prove: (
a
) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (
b
) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.
[19]
 Meanwhile, in instances wherein an accused is charged with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, the prosecution must establish the following elements to warrant his conviction: (
a
) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (
b
) such possession was not authorized by law; and (
c
) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.
[20]
 In both instances, case law instructs that it is essential that the identity of the prohibited drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the 
corpus delicti
 of the crime. Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubt on the identity of the dangerous drugs, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.
[21]
 
 Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 outlines the procedure which the police officers must follow when handling the seized drugs in order to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value.
[22]
 Under the said section, prior to its amendment by RA 10640,
[23]
 the apprehending team shall, among others, 
immediately after seizure and confiscation conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items 
in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official
 who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same, and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation for examination.
[24]
 In the case of 
People v. Mendoza
,
[25]
 the Court stressed that "
[w]ithout the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the [DOJ], or any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the [seized drugs], the evils of switching, 'planting' or contamination of the evidence
 that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of [RA] 6425 (
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972
) again reared their ugly heads as to 
negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the [said drugs] that were evidence herein of the 
corpus delicti
, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.
 Indeed, the x x x presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody."
[26]
 
 The Court, however, clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 may not always be possible.
[27]
 In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 â which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 10640
[28]
 â provide that the said inventory and photography may be conducted at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team in instances of warrantless seizure, and that 
non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 â 
under justifiable
 grounds â will not render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items 
so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team
.
[29]
 In other words, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 and its IRR does not
 ipso facto
 render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (
a
) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; 
and
 (
b
) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.
[30]
 In 
People v. Almorfe
,
[31]
 
the Court explained that for the above-saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved
.
[32]
 Also, in 
People v. De Guzman
,
[33]
 it was emphasized that 
the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.
[34]
 
 After a judicious study of the case, the Court finds that the police officers committed unjustified deviations from the prescribed chain of custody rule, thereby putting into question the integrity and evidentiary value of the dangerous drugs allegedly seized from Cabrellos.
 Initially, it would appear that the arresting officers complied with the witness requirement during inventory, as seen in the Receipt of Property Seized
[35]
 dated September 22, 2005 which contains the signatures of the required witnesses, 
i.e
., a public elected official, a representative from the DOJ, and a representative from the media. However, no less than PO3Germodo admitted in open court that they actually conducted two (2) separate inventories in different places and in the presence of different witnesses. Pertinent portions of his direct testimony read: 
 
 [Pros. Yuseff Cesar YbaÃ±ez, Jr.]: After you were able to make the said marking, were you able to take pictures with the accused inside her house?
 [PO3 Germodo]: No, sir. We only took pictures 
during the inventory at the police station of Ayungon
. 
 
x x x x 
 
Q: Mr. Witness, after you have prepared, and signed of the properties seized and gone with the markings of the property seized, what did you do then, if any? 
 A: We conducted the inventory of the confiscated items 
together with the witness, the [B]rgy. 
Kagawad
 Raul Fausto and he signed the inventory
.
 
 Q: And after Raul Fausto signed the inventory, what happened then, if any? 
 A: Since there was no report from the media [and] the Department of Justice, 
we proceeded to Dumaguete City
. 
 
Q: Where did you proceed in Dumaguete City? 
 A: In our office.
 
 Q: Where is your office located? 
 A: 
It is located at PNP compound, Locsin St., Dumaguete City
. 
 
Q: After you arrived there, what happened then? 
 A: I called the media representative and the DOJ.
 
 Q: And did they arrive, the media representative and the DOJ representative? 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q: After they arrived, what transpired at your office? 
 A: We conduct (
sic
) again an inventory. 
 
Q: After conducting the second inventory, what did you do then, if any? 
 A: After the inventory we made a request for PNP crime laboratory.
[36]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)
 
 
 From the foregoing testimony, it is clear that the arresting officers conducted two (2) separate inventories, both of which are glaringly nonÂ­ compliant with the required witnesses rule: (
a
) in the inventory conducted at the Ayungon Police Station, only a public elected official â Brgy. 
Kagawad
 Raul Fausto â was present thereat; and (
b
) on the other hand, the inventory conducted at the Dumaguete Police Station was witnessed only by representatives from the DOJ and the media. To make matters worse, the arresting officers attempted to cover up such fact by preparing a single inventory sheet signed by the witnesses at different times and places. Verily, the chain of custody rule laid down by RA 9165 and its IRR contemplates a situation where the inventory conducted on the seized items is witnessed by the required personalities at the same time. The wordings of the law leave no room for any piecemeal compliance with the required witnesses rule as what happened in this case. Otherwise, the avowed purpose of the required witnesses rule â which is to prevent the evils of switching, planting, or contamination of the 
corpus delicti
 resulting in the tainting of its integrity and evidentiary value â will be greatly diminished or even completely negated.
 At this point, it is well to note that the non-compliance with the required witnesses rule does not per se render the confiscated items inadmissible.
[37]
 However, a justifiable reason for such failure or a 
showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses
 under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 must be adduced.
[38]
 In 
People v. Umipang
,
[39]
 the Court held that the prosecution must show that 
earnest efforts
 were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the law for "[a] sheer statement that representatives were unavailable â without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances â is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse."
[40]
 Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.
[41]
 These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time â beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest â to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165. 
As such, police officers are compelled not only to state the reasons for their non-compliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstance, their actions were reasonable
.
[42]
 To reiterate, PO3 Germodo admitted that they had to re-do the inventory at the Dumaguete Police Station for it to be witnessed by the DOJ and media representatives. However, the re-conduct of the inventory at the Dumaguete Police Station was no longer witnessed by the public elected official who was left behind at the Ayungon Police Station. Unfortunately, no excuse was offered for such mishap; and worse, they even tried to trivialize the matter by making the required witnesses sign a single inventory sheet despite the fact that they witnessed the conduct of two (2) separate inventories. Thus, for failure of the prosecution to provide justifiable grounds or show that special circumstances exist which would excuse their transgression, the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Cabrellos have been compromised. It is settled that in a prosecution for the Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165, the State carries the heavy burden of proving not only the elements of the offense, but also to prove the integrity of the 
corpus delicti
, failing in which, renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
[43]
 It is well-settled that the procedure in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects.
[44]
 As such, since the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with the aforesaid provision, Cabrellos's acquittal is perforce in order.
 As a final note, the Court finds it fitting to echo its recurring pronouncement in recent jurisprudence on the subject matter: 
 
 The Court strongly supports the campaign of the government against drug addiction and commends the efforts of our law enforcement officers against those who would inflict this malediction upon our people, especially the susceptible youth. But as demanding as this campaign may be, it cannot be more so than the compulsions of the Bill of Rights for the protection of liberty of every individual in the realm, including the basest of criminals. The Constitution covers with the mantle of its protection the innocent and the guilty alike against any manner of high-handedness from the authorities, however praiseworthy their intentions.
 
 Those who are supposed to enforce the law are not justified in disregarding the right of the individual in the name of order. Order is too high a price for the loss of liberty. x x x.
[45]
 
 
 "In this light, prosecutors are strongly reminded that they have the 
positive duty
 to prove compliance with the procedure set forth in Section 21 [, Article II] of RA 9165, as amended. As such, 
they must have the 
initiative
 to not only 
acknowledge
 but also 
justify
 any perceived deviations from the said procedure during the proceedings before the trial court.
 Since compliance with the procedure is determinative of the integrity and evidentiary value of the 
corpus delicti
 and ultimately, the fate of the liberty of the accused, the fact that any issue regarding the same was not raised, or even threshed out in the court/s below, would not preclude the appellate court, including this Court, from fully examining the records of the case if only to ascertain whether the procedure had been completely complied with, and if not, whether justifiable reasons exist to excuse any deviation. If no such reasons exist, then it is the appellate court's bounden duty to acquit the accused, and perforce, overturn a conviction."

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
 
PERALTA, 
J.
:
 
 I concur with the 
ponencia
 in acquitting accused-appellant Patricia Cabrellos y Dela Cruz of the charges of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, or violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (
R.A. No. 9165
),
[1]
 respectively. I agree that the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for the arresting officers' non-observance of the three-witness rule under Section 21

 of R.A. No. 9165, 
i.e
., why they had to re-do the inventory of the seized items at the police station for it to be witnessed by the representatives from the Department of Justice and the media 
sans
 the presence of an elected public official, who was the only one present during the initial inventory of the said items. At any rate, I would like to emphasize on important matters relative to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. 
 To properly guide law enforcement agents as to the proper handling of confiscated drugs, Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (
IRR
) of R.A. No. 9165 filled in the details as to where the inventory and photographing of seized items had to be done, and added a saving clause in case the procedure is not followed:
[3]
 
 
 (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: 
Provided
, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; 
Provided, further,
 that nonÂ­ compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items.
 
 
 
 It bears emphasis that R.A. No. 10640,
[4]
 which amended Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, now only requires 
two (2) witnesses
 to be present during the conduct of the physical inventory and taking of photograph of the seized items, namely: (a) an elected public official; 
and
 (b) either a representative from the National Prosecution Service 
or
 the media.
 In her Sponsorship Speech on Senate Bill No. 2273, which eventually became R.A. No. 10640, Senator Grace Poe conceded that "while Section 21 was enshrined in the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act to safeguard the integrity of the evidence acquired and prevent planting of evidence, the application of said Section resulted in the ineffectiveness of the government's campaign to stop the increasing drug addiction and also, in the conflicting decisions of the courts."
[5]
 Senator Poe stressed the necessity for the amendment of Section 21 based on the public hearing that the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs had conducted, which revealed that "compliance with the rule on witnesses during the physical inventory is difficult. For one, media representatives are not always available in all corners of the Philippines, especially in the remote areas. For another there were instances where elected 
barangay
 officials themselves were involved in the punishable acts apprehended and thus, it is difficult to get the most grassroot-elected public official to be a witness as required by law."
[6]
 In his Co-sponsorship speech, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III said that in view of a substantial number of acquittals in drug-related cases due to the varying interpretations of prosecutors and judges on Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, there is a need for "certain adjustments so that we can plug the loopholes in our existing law" and ensure [its] standard implementation."
[7]
 Senator Sotto explained why the said provision should be amended: 
 
 Numerous drug trafficking activities can be traced to operations of highly organized and powerful local and international syndicates. The presence of such syndicates that have the resources and the capability to mount a counter-assault to apprehending law enforcers makes the requirement of Section 21(a) impracticable for law enforcers to comply with. It makes the place of seizure extremely unsafe for the proper inventory and photograph of the seized illegal drugs.
 
 x x x x
 
 Section 21(a) of RA 9165 need to be amended to address the foregoing situation. We did not realize this in 2002 where the safety of the law enforcers and other persons required to be present in the inventory and photography of seized illegal drugs and the preservation of the very existence of seized illegal drugs itself are threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of drug syndicates at the place of seizure. The place where the seized drugs may be inventoried and photographed has to include a location where the seized drugs as well as the persons who are required to be present during the inventory and photograph are safe and secure from extreme danger.
 
 It is proposed that the physical inventory and taking of photographs of seized illegal drugs be allowed to be conducted either in the place of seizure of illegal drugs or at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending law enforcers. The proposal will provide effective measures to ensure the integrity of seized illegal drugs since a safe location makes it more probable for an inventory and photograph of seized illegal drugs to be properly conducted, thereby reducing the incidents of dismissal of drug cases due to technicalities.
 
 Non-observance of the prescribed procedures should not automatically mean that the seizure or confiscation is invalid or illegal, as long as the law enforcement officers could justify the same and could prove that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are not tainted. This is the effect of the inclusion in the proposal to amend the phrase "justifiable grounds." There are instances where there are no media people or representatives from the DOJ available and the absence of these witnesses should not automatically invalidate the drug operation conducted. Even the presence of a public local elected official also is sometimes impossible especially if the elected official is afraid or scared.
[8]
 
 
 However, under the original provision of Section 21 and its IRR, which is applicable at the time the appellant committed the crime charged, the apprehending team was required to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the drugs after their seizure and confiscation in the presence of no less than 
three (3) witnesses
, namely: (a) a representative from the media, 
and
 (b) the DOJ, 
and
; (c) any elected public official who shall be required to sign copies of the inventory and be given copy thereof. The presence of the three witnesses was intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up, as they were "necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity."
[9]
 
 The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for nonÂ­ compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. It has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law.
[10]
 Its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence. It should take note that the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items.
[11]
 Strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is minuscule, since it is highly susceptible to planting, tampering or alteration of evidence.
[12]
 In this case, the prosecution never alleged and proved that the presence of all the required witnesses was not obtained for any of the following reasons, such as: (1) 
their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area
; (2) 
their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs were threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf;
 (3) 
the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended;
 (4) 
earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125
[13]
 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention
; or (5) 
time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.
 Invocation of the disputable presumptions that the police officers regularly performed their official duty and, that the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, will not suffice to uphold appellant's conviction. Judicial reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity.
[14]
 The presumption may only arise when there is a showing that the apprehending officer/team followed the requirements of Section 21 or when the saving clause found in the IRR is successfully triggered. In this case, the presumption of regularity had been contradicted and overcome by evidence of non-compliance with the law.
[15]
 
 At this point, it is not amiss to express my position regarding the issue of which between the Congress and the Judiciary has jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of compliance with the rule on chain of custody, which essentially boils down to the application of procedural rules on admissibility of evidence. In this regard, I agree with the view of Hon. Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro in 
People v. Teng Moner y Adam
[16]
 that "if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case." As aptly pointed out by Justice Leonardo-De Castro, the Court's power to promulgate judicial rules, including rules of evidence, is no longer shared by the Court with Congress. 
 I subscribe to the view of Justice Leonardo-De Castro that the chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Evidentiary matters are indeed well within the powers of courts to appreciate and rule upon, and so, when the courts find appropriate, substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved may warrant the conviction of the accused.
 I further submit that 
the requirements of marking the seized items, conduct of inventory and taking photograph in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ and a local elective official, are police investigation procedures which call for administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. Violation of such procedure may even merit penalty under R.A. No. 9165
, to wit: 
 
 
Section 29. 
Criminal Liability for Planting of Evidenc
e. â Any person who is found guilty of "planting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity, shall suffer the penalty of death. 
 
Section 32.
 
Liability to a Person Violating Any Regulation Issued by the Board.
 â The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board.
 
 
 However, non-observance of such police administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure of the evidence, because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, which is exclusively within the prerogative of the courts to decide in accordance with the rules on evidence.
