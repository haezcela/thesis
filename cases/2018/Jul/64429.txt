SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 222436, July 23, 2018 ]


COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, V. EURO-PHILIPPINES AIRLINE SERVICES, INC., RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




REYES, JR., J:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the Decision
[2]
 dated July 14, 2015 and Resolution
[3]
 dated December 22, 2015 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) 
En Banc
 in case CTA EB Case No. 1106 affirming the Decision of the CTA Special First Division which cancelled and withdrew the assessments for deficiency value-added tax, as well as interest and surcharges.
 
THE ANTECEDENTS
 
Respondent Euro-Philippines Airline Services, Inc. (Euro-Phil) is an exclusive passenger sales agent of British Airways, PLC, an off-line international airline in the Philippines to service the latter's passengers in the Philippines.
[4]
 
 Euro-Phil received a Formal Assessment Notice (FAN)
[5]
 dated September 13, 2010 from petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) on 14 September 2010 in the aggregate amount of P4,271,228.20 consisting of assessment of Value Added Tax (VAT), among others, for the taxable year ending March 31, 2007 with Details of Discrepancies.
[6]
 
On 29 September 2010, Euro-Phil filed a final protest on CIR.
[7]
 
 Following the lapse of the 180-day period within which to resolve the protest, Euro-Phil filed a petition for review before the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division (CTA-First Division) praying, among others, for the cancellation of the FAN issued by CIR for deficiency VAT. Euro-Phil argued therein that the receipts that are supposedly subject to 12% VAT actually pertained to "services rendered to persons engaged exclusively in international air transport" hence, zero-rated.
[8]
 
The CTA- Special First Division rendered a Decision
[9]
 on 25 July 2013 finding Euro-Phil is rendering services to persons engaged in international air transport operations and, as such, is zero-rated under Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997. The said decision disposed thus:
[10]
 
 
 
WHEREFORE
, the instant Petition for Review is 
PARTIALLY GRANTED
. The assessments for deficiency value-added tax and documentary stamp tax, as well as the interests and surcharges, for the taxable year ending March 31, 2007 are hereby 
CANCELLED
 and 
WITHDRAWN
 for lack of legal basis.
 
 x x x x 
 
SO ORDERED.
"
[11]
 
 
 CIR filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the said Decision covering only the value-added tax that was denied therein. Such motion was denied for lack of merit in a Resolution dated 18 November 2013.
[12]
 
 CIR then appealed before the CTA 
En Banc
 alleging that CTA Special First Division erred in not holding that Euro-Phil's services is subject to 12% VAT.
[13]
 
 The CTA 
En Banc
 rendered a Decision
[14]
 denying the petition and sustaining the CTA Special First Division with which CTA Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario (Justice Del Rosario) concurred with Dissenting Opinion.
[15]
 The said decision disposed thus: 
 
 
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the instant Petition for Review is hereby 
DENIED
. Accordingly, the Decision and the Resolution, dated July 25, 2013 and November 18, 2013, respectively, are hereby 
AFFIRMED
. 
 
 
SO ORDERED.
[16]
 
 
 
CIR moved for reconsideration of the said decision insisting that the presentation of VAT official receipts with the words "zero-rated" imprinted thereon is indispensable to cancel the value-added tax (VAT) assessment against Euro-Phil.
[17]
 However, it was denied in a Resolution
[18]
 dated December 22, 2015 with a dissenting opinion
[19]
 from CTA Presiding Justice (Justice del Rosario), to quote as follows, pertinent to the issue of VAT: 
 
 In the case at bar, respondent is assessed for deficiency VAT for services it rendered as passenger sales agent of British Airways PLC. Respondent invokes that services rendered by VAT-registered persons to persons engaged in international air transport operations is subject to zero percent (0%) rate, pursuant to Section 108 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.
 
 To reiterate, it is not enough for respondent to invoke Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. Respondent has likewise the burden to show compliance with the invoicing requirements laid down in Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, to be entitled to zero rating. Needless to say, unless appropriately refuted, tax assessments by tax examiners are presumed correct and made in good faith.
 
 In fine, the issue of compliance with Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, is vital in the disposition of the present controversy which the Court should consider, lest an indispensable requirement for the availment of VAT zero-rating is blatantly ignored.
 
 For all the foregoing, I VOTE to grant petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and UPHOLD the VAT assessment."
[20]
 
 
 
 Hence, this petition with CIR adopting Justice Del Rosario's dissent and that Euro-Phil had to comply with the invoicing requirements to be entitled to zero rating of VAT.
[21]
 CIR also takes exception to the doctrine of "issues cannot be raised the first time on appeal." 
 The Issues 
 Whether or not the issue of non-compliance of the invoicing requirements by Euro-Phil must be recognized despite being raised only on appeal; and 
 
 Whether or not the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 erred in finding that the transaction sale made by respondent is entitled to the benefit of zero-rated VAT despite its failure to comply with invoicing requirements as mandated by law. 
 
 
Our Ruling
 
 The petition is denied. 
 
 
The CTA 
En Banc
 did not commit any reversible error.
 
 
 
 
Euro-Phil contends that CIR raised new matters in its Petition for Review with the CTA 
En Banc
 and does it again in this Petition for Review which should not be allowed by this Court. 
 We agree. 
 In the case of 
Aguinaldo Industries Corporation (Fishing Nets Division) vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Court of Tax Appeals
,
[22]
 this doctrine was explained by this Court as follows: 
 
 To allow a litigant to assume a different posture when he comes before the court and challenge the position he had accepted at the administrative level would be to sanction a procedure whereby the court â which is supposed to review administrative determinations would not review, but determine and decide for the first time, a question not raised at the administrative forum. This cannot be permitted, for the same reason that underlies the requirement of prior exhaustion of administrative remedies to give administrative authorities the prior opportunity to decide controversies within its competence, and in much the same way that, on the judicial level, issues not raised in the lower court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.
[23]
 
 
 
 Here, it is not disputed that CIR raised the issue that the alleged failure to present VAT official receipts with the imprinted words "zero rated" adopting the dissent of Justice Del Rosario, only at the latter stage of the appeal on Motion for Reconsideration of the CTA 
En Banc
's decision. Accordingly, with the doctrine that issues may not be raised for the first time on appeal, CIR should not be allowed by this Court to raise this matter. 
 Moreover, while the issue arose from the dissent of Justice Del Rosario, the law is clear on the matter. Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997 imposes zero percent (0%) value-added tax on services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons to persons engaged in international air transport operations, as it thus provides: 
 
 
Section 108. Value-added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. â
 
 (A) x x x x 
 
(B) 
T
ransactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate
 -
 The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT- registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate.
 
 
 (1) x x x x 
 
 x x x x 
 
(4) 
Services rendered to persons engaged in
 international shipping or 
International air-transport operations
, including leases of property for use thereof; 
 
 x x x x
 
 
 Here, there is no dispute that Euro-Phil is VAT registered. Next, it is also not disputed that the services rendered by Euro-Phil was to a person engaged in international air-transport operations. Thus, by application, Section 108 of the NIRC of 1997 subjects the services of Euro-Phil to British Airways PLC, to the rate of zero percent VAT. 
 While CIR contends that the dissenting opinion of Justice del Rosario that Euro-Phil's failure to present and offer any proof to show that it has complied with the invoicing requirements, deems its sale of services to British Airways PLC subject to 12% VAT, it does not negate the established fact that British Airways PLC is engaged in international air-transport operations.
 Moreover, as dictated by Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997, on the said provisions on the "Consequences of Issuing Erroneous VAT Invoice of VAT Official Receipt,
[24]
 nowhere therein is a presumption created by law that the non-imprintment of the word "zero rated" deems the transaction subject to 12 % VAT. In addition, Section 4. 113-4 of Revenue Regulations 16-2005,
[25]
 Consolidated Value-Added Tax Regulations of 2005, also does not state that the non-imprintment of the word "zero rated" deems the transaction subject to 12 %VAT. Thus, in this case, failure to comply with invoicing requirements as mandated by law does not deem the transaction subject to 12% VAT. 
 In view of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CTA 
En Banc
 did not commit any reversible error. 
 
WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review is 
DENIED
. The Decision
[26]
 dated July 14, 2015 and Resolution
[27]

CONCURRING OPINION
 
 
CAGUIOA, 
J.
:
 
 
The petition of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), which seeks to reverse and set aside the decision of the CTA 
En Banc
 cancelling the value-added tax (VAT) assessment issued against respondent EuroÂ­ Philippines Airline Services, Inc., is anchored on respondent's failure to comply with the invoicing requirements provided under Section 113 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended. The CIR asserts that since respondent failed to print the word "zero-rated" in its VAT official receipts, the subject transaction cannot be considered as zero-rated. In support of this argument, the CIR alludes to the case of Kepco Philippines Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
[1]
 (Kepco) and other VAT refund cases,
[2]
 where the Court has consistently ruled that the failure to print the word "zero-rated" on the invoices or receipts is fatal to a claim for refund or credit of input VAT on zero-rated sales. The CIR, adopting the dissenting opinion of Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario, posits that the strict compliance with the invoicing requirement in refund cases should also be applied in this case. 
 
 However, I find the ruling in Kepco and other relevant VAT refund cases on the strict compliance with invoicing requirement inapplicable to the instant case.
 In 
Panasonic Communications Imaging Corp. of the Philippines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[3]
 involving a claim for refund of input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales, the Court explained that the requirement of printing the word "zero-rated" on the invoice or receipt "is reasonable and is in accord with the efficient collection of VAT from the covered sales of goods and services. x x x [T]he appearance of the word "zero-rated" on the face of invoices covering zero-rated sales prevents buyers from falsely claiming input VAT from their purchases when no VAT was actually paid. If, absent such word, a successful claim for input VAT is made, the government would be refunding money it did not collect."
[4]
 In other words, the ratio for requiring the printing of the word "zero-rated" was essentially to protect the government from refunding a tax it did not actually collect; thus, unjustly enriching the taxpayer at the expense of the government.
 However, the "evil" of refunding taxes not actually paid is not present in this case. Here, respondent is not claiming for a refund of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales. On the contrary, respondent is being assessed by the government for deficiency VAT on transactions which, under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and as sufficiently proven by respondent, are clearly subject to 0% VAT rate. Thus, to apply the strict compliance rule in this case is tantamount to allowing the government to collect taxes not authorized by law. Upholding the deficiency VAT assessment against respondent simply because the word "zero-rated" does not appear on the VAT official receipts will only result in the government effectively enriching itself at the expense of the taxpayer â the very evil which the strict compliance rule seeks to prevent in the first place.
 Verily, in light of the foregoing considerations, I concur with the denial of the CIR's petition and affirmance of the decision and resolution of the CTA 
En Banc
 cancelling the deficiency VAT assessment issued against respondent.
