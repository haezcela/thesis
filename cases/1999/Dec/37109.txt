EXEC. JUDGE DAVID C. NAVAL AND DSWD SECRETARY CORAZON ALMA
DE LEON, COMPLAINANTS, VS. JUDGE JOSE R. PANDAY, RTC, BRANCH 27, NAGA
CITY, JUDGE SIMON D. ENCINAS, RTC BRANCH 51, SORSOGON, AND JUDGE RICA H. LACSON,
MTC, SORSOGON, SORSOGON, RESPONDENTS.

R E S O L U T I O N




PER
CURIAM:


From the Decision of the
Court dated July 21, 1997,
[1]
 the dispositive portion of which reads:


âIN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Court RESOLVES as follows:


1.  Judge Jose R. Panday is
found administratively liable for immorality and obstruction of justice.  Accordingly, he is DISMISSED from the
service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leaves, and
with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the
government, including government-owned and controlled corporations.


2.  Judge Rica H. Lacson is
found administratively liable for engaging in notarial services in connection
with cases unrelated to her official functions as municipal judge of Sorsogon.  Accordingly, she is meted a FINE of Ten
Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) with warning that a repetition by her of similar
acts will be dealt with more severely.


3.  Judge Simon D. Encinas
is found administratively liable for improper conduct or conduct unbecoming a
judge.  Accordingly, he is meted a FINE
of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) with warning that a repetition of similar
acts of impropriety on his part will be dealt with more severely.


SO ORDERED.â


Respondent
Judge Jose R. Panday filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated August 15, 1997
[2]
seeking a partial reconsideration by:  a.] absolving him from the charges of
immorality and obstruction of justice; b.] dismissing the same for utter lack
of merit; c.] lifting his preventive suspension, and d.] reinstating him to his
position as presiding judge of Branch 27 of the RTC of Camarines Sur, or, in
the alternative, to consider him retired from the service with all his
retirement benefits and accrued leaves intact including the removal of the ban
on his employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government-owned and
controlled corporations.


Respondent Judge Simon D.
Encinas likewise filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated September 20, 1997
[3]
 praying that the findings of improper
conduct or conduct unbecoming a judge be reconsidered with a penalty less harsh
for his âbeing less than discreet in showing curiosity and concern for a
brethren.â


Additionally, Judge
Encinas filed a "Motion To Pay Fine Subject To The Outcome Of Motion For
Reconsideration" dated October 13, 1997
[4]
 where he, among others, "manifested due
respect and good faith in complying with the Decision xxx by paying the penalty
in advance xxx subject to the outcome of the Motion for Reconsideration"
averring, 
inter alia, 
that:  1.]
on account of his ill health, he filed a disability and/or optional retirement
application; 2.] in order not to suspend due action on his retirement
application, he is willing to deposit in cash the amount of the penalty or to
authorize the deduction of the same from his retirement benefits in case the
motion for reconsideration is denied.


The records show that
subsequently, judge Encinas paid the imposed fine of Twenty Thousand
(P20,000.00) Pesos in cash as evidenced by an Official Receipt No. 8450231
dated November 6, 1997 issued by the Collecting Officer of the RTC of Sorsogon,
Branch 51.
[5]


On February 4, 1999
, 
private
complainant filed a Comment/Opposition To Motion for Reconsideration
[6]
 praying that the motion for reconsideration
of respondent Judge Panday be denied for lack of merit to which the later
subsequently filed a Reply on July 9, 1999.


It appears from the
records that no comment and/or opposition was made to the motion for
reconsideration filed by respondent Judge Encinas.  It likewise appears that respondent Judge Rica H. Lacson did not
file a motion for reconsideration of the Court's Decision.


In view of this Court's
Resolution dated October 21, 1997 which reads:


Acting on the Motion for Reconsideration of the decision of July
21, 1997, filed by counsel for respondent Judge Simon D. Encinas, dated
September 20, 1997, the Court resolved to DENY with FINALITY the aforesaid
motion for reconsideration, as the basic issues raised therein have been passed
upon by the Court in its questioned decision and no substantial arguments were
presented to warrant its reversal.


the
Court will concentrate on the motion of respondent Judge Panday.


On the charge of
immorality, respondent judge insists that the alleged incident at the 
Bodega
Tigaon 
did not take place.  In support
thereof, he reiterated the testimonial declarations of Wilfredo Bolalin,
Domingo Pasibe and Delia Cea.  In sum,
the testimonies of Bolalin and Pasibe are to the effect that they were in the
immediate vicinity of the compound of the inn where the alleged incident took
place on July 24, 1994 from 11:00 a.m. until the early evening â the duration
of the alleged incident of rape, which took place at around 2:00 p.m. or
thereabouts.  Bolalin and Pasibe
declared that they observed nothing untoward from their vantage point and that
nothing could have transpired without their knowledge during that busy
afternoon where there was even a boxing practice.


Counsel for respondent
argues that the foregoing testimonies of Bolalin and Pasibe fall clearly under
the category of positive testimony citing as authorities 
Revilla v. Court of
Appeals
[7]
and 
Tanala v.
 
NLRC.
[8]
 
These affirmative testimonial declarations according to counsel
â...puts in serious doubt the already deemed incredible [as to certain facts]
testimony of the alleged victim Cecile Buenafe.â


Respondent judge and
counsel likewise capitalize on the testimony of Delia Cea who declared on the
strength of the 
Bodega Tigaon's
 Registry Book for July 1994
[9]
 that with the exception of those customers
who checked-in but requested that their names be not entered in the logbook, no
one with the name Jose R. Panday or Cecile Buenafe or persons who bore such
names registered and checked-in at the pension house on July 24, 1994.


We remain
unimpressed.  For all the evidentiary hairsplitting
of respondent judge and counsel on what positive and negative testimony is
supposed to be, the primordial question to be resolved still boils down to the 
credibility

of the said witnesses' averments.


To reiterate what has
been stated earlier in the Decision
[10]
 sought to be reconsidered, such testimonies
failed to convince the Investigating Justice and the Court is likewise not
convinced by them. As pointedly observed therein -


... [t]he testimonies
of Wilfredo Bolalin, Domingo Pasibe and Delia Cea to the effect that they did
not see judge Panday at the Tigaon pension house on 24 July 1994 constitute
negative testimonies which can not prevail over Cecile's positive testimony
that she was there with him on said date.  Testimony is negative when the witness states that he did not see or
know the occurrence of a fact and positive when the witness affirms that a fact
did or did not occur.
[11]
 A positive testimony, such as Cecile's is stronger
than a negative one.  The former has
more value than the latter for the reason that he who denies a certain fact may
both remember exactly the circumstances on which he bases his denial.
[12]


Delia Cea's claim that based on their
logbook for July 1994, no one checked in at Bodega Tigaon on 24 July 1994,
cannot be relied upon by Judge Panday to support his denial.  Cea herself admitted, in response to the
clarificatory questions of the Investigating Justice, that there were occasions
when the names of the customers of the pension house were not recorded in the
logbook upon request of the customers themselves:


âJUSTICE CALLEJO:


Are you saying that there were times when you did not follow the
instructions of the owner of the pension house?


WITNESS:


No, Sir, I usually follow the Instructions but there are times the
customers request to me not to sign their names anymore since they knew each
other anyway.


JUSTICE CALLEJO:


Is it also possible that, or where (
sic
) there instances
where the customers request you that they will not be required to sign anymore
because the girl[s] that they are with are not their wives?


WITNESS:


Yes, Sir.


JUSTICE CALLEJO:


So there were customers who would like their identities to be
unknown, not to be recorded and sometimes you acceded to the request, is that
correct?


WITNESS:


Yes, your Honor.
[13]


Hence, the fact that Judge Panday's name was not recorded in the
logbook kept by the Tigaon pension house does not prove that he was not there
on 24 July 1994.  As it was, the logbook
failed to negate Cecile's testimony that she was there with Judge Panday and
that they had sexual intercourse in Room 6 thereof
 
in
 
the
afternoon of 24 July 1994.
[14]


Testimony is affirmative
or positive if it consists of statements as to what the witness heard or
seen.  It is negative if the witness
states that he 
did not hear 
or
 did not see 
the
 
phenomenon
in question.
[15]
 The Court has held in at least two (2) cases
that the testimony of a credible witness that he saw or heard a particular
thing at a particular time and place is more reliable than that of a witness
who with the same opportunities, testified that he did not hear or see the same
thing at the same time and place.
[16]
 Moreover, the positive testimony of a single
witness is entitled to more weight and credence than the testimony of several
witnesses who testified in the negative or to collateral matters.  Thus, in 
People v. Tibayan,
[17]
 
the sister of the victim testified that she and her father saw the
accused shoot her brother to death while a farmer and his mother testified for
the defense that they were near the scene of the crime; that they did not see
the sister of the victim and her father; and that they neither saw the accused
and his companions.  In affirming the
judgment of conviction, the Court held that the negative testimony of the farmer
and his mother is not conclusive proof that the accused did not shoot the
victim nor does it
 
completely belie the sister's testimony that she and
her father witnessed the shooting.


In this case, no weight
and credit can be given to the testimonies of Bolalin and Pasibe for while they
claim that they were in the immediate vicinity of the compound of the 
Bodega
Tigaon 
on the day, time and place of the incident while there was an
ongoing boxing practice, their failure to see and observe the alleged incident
can be attributed to want of particular attention considering their
preoccupation with the boxing practice.  Moreover, the testimony of a witness that he does not remember or has no
knowledge of a particular matter has little or no weight as against the direct
testimony of a witness who does remember the matter or against the positive
evidence that an event occurred which is not contradicted by a witness'
testimony that he does not remember whether it occurred or not.
[18]


Respondent Judge and
counsel further argue that this Court disregarded the inconsistency between
prior statements made by Cecile Buenafe and her testimony in court on account
of the inadvertence of confronting her with the same and allowing her the
opportunity to explain such inconsistency as required by the rules.  This point according to respondent judge and
counsel has, however, been rendered rnoot because this Court as recommended by
the Investigating Justice, found her testimony as incredible in certain parts.


The arguments merits no
serious thought.


While the Court agreed
with the Investigating Justice that indeed certain claims made by Cecile in her
testimony were not worthy of credence, the Court explained in the assailed
judgment that -


... [a]s correctly
asserted by the Investigating Justice, Cecile's false or erroneous claim that
she was raped by Judge Panday does not render her entire testimony unworthy of
credence.  The Court is not compelled to
reject the entire testimony of a witness if it finds portions thereof to be
incredible.  Like trial courts in
criminal proceedings, the Investigating Justice tasked by the Court to
investigate the present Administrative Matter had the discretion to accept
portions of the testimony of a witness as he deemed credible and reject those
which he believed to be false.  The
maxim 
falsus in uno, falsus
 
in omnibus is 
not a positive rule of
law and is in fact rarely applied in modern jurisprudence.
[19]
 Before this maxim can be applied, the
witness must be shown to have willfully falsified the truth on one or more
material points.  Even then, where he is
found to have done so, this does not make his entire  testimony totally incredible.  The Court, or the Investigating Justice in this case, may still admit
and credit those portions worthy of belief depending upon the corroborative
evidence and the probabilities and improbabilities of the case.
[20]


The postulate of
respondent judge that the credible portions of the witness' testimony that may
be believed are "ONLY those which are corroborated by other evidenceâ
[21]
 must likewise be rejected because in addition
to âcorroborative evidence' is the qualifier 
"and the probabilities and
Improbabilities of the case.â 
It
 
need not be overemphasized that,
given the peculiar facts prevailing in this case, the probability that
respondent judge committed the act complained of far outweighs its
improbability.  This is further
circumscribed by the oft-repeated rule that witnesses are weighed not numbered
and 
testimony of a single witness may suffice for conviction if otherwise
trustworthy and reliable.
[22]


Thus the Court ruled:  â[T]hat the prosecution had only one
eyewitness hardly affects its cause.  There is no law which requires that the testimony of a single witness
needs corroboration except where the law 
expressly 
mandates such
corroboration.â
[23]
 Verily, criminals are convicted, not on the
number of witnesses against them, but on the credibility of the testimony of
even one witness who is able to convince the court of the guilt of the accused
beyond a shadow of doubt.
[24]
 To rephrase what had been said earlier, the
Investigating justice found the testimony of Cecil Buenafe more convincing than
those of respondent judge's witnesses. So does this Court.


So too must be rejected
the contention that since the Court made a finding that Cecile Buenafe was not
forcibly raped by the respondent judge, this can only lead to the dismissal of
the criminal case for rape against him.


It needs be stressed in
this regard that in the instant proceeding, respondent judge is being
administratively held to account for serious misconduct or malfeasance in
office.  The quantum of proof required
to establish respondent judge's misconduct in the administrative complaint is
not proof beyond reasonable doubt but substantial evidence.
[25]
 It need not be overemphasized that the
factual landscape, measured within such an evidentiary matrix, is strewn with
overwhelming proof of respondent judge's perfidy thus prompting the Court in
the challenged Decision to concur with the Investigating justice in holding
that complainants were able to muster the requisite quantum of evidence to
prove their charges against him.


Moreover, in any
prosecution involving an unchaste act perpetrated by a man against a woman
where the willingness of the woman is material such as rape and acts of
lasciviousness, the woman's character as to her chastity is admissible to show
whether or not she consented to manâs act.
[26]
 Hence, in a 
prosecution for rape
, or
for 
enticement to prostitution
, or in an action or prosecution for 
indecent


assault,
 the likes of acts of lasciviousness, the 
woman's character
as to chastity
 
is
 
admissible
, but 
not in a prosecution for
rape under the age of consent,
 
because in a trial for sex offenses where
the woman's consent is immaterial and not in issue, it follows that the woman's
unchastity would likewise be immaterial
, like a charge for rape of a woman
under twelve (12) years of age.
[27]


The administrative
complaint filed by Cecile Buenafe and the DSWD, through Regional Office No. V,
against, Judge Panday is "for immorality for sexual abuse and rape"
of Cecile which is defined and penalized under RA No. 7610, then the subject
matter of Criminal Case No. 2990 pending preliminary investigation before the
Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Tigaon-Sangay, Camarines Sur.  In this regard, Article III, Section 5 of
the statute states in no uncertain terms that-


SEC. 5.  
Child
prostitution and other sexual abuses
. -  Children whether male or female, who for money, profit or any other
consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or
group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be
children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.


In relation to the
foregoing, Article I, Section 3 (a) of the same law defines âchildrenâ as those
"[p]ersons below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable
to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect,
cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental
disability.â In this case, Cecile Buenafe was fifteen (15) years old at that time,
a third-year high school student in San Ramon, Lagonoy, Camarines Sur and of
lowly station in life.  Needless to
state, her case falls within the purview of RA No. 7610.


By having sexual congress
with Cecile who was then only fifteen (15) years old, respondent Judge violated
the trust reposed on his high office and utterly failed to live up to noble
ideals and strict standards of morality required of members of the
judiciary.  Additionally, his subsequent
act of offering Cecile's father a substantial amount of money in consideration
for the withdrawal of their charges against him is considered, by law, an
obstruction of justice.
[28]
 That the respondent Judge even reneged on
the agreed amount for the withdrawal of the charges against him only serves to
underscore the greater perversity of his character and betrays his disdain for
the lowly whose rights he has sworn to protect.  To repeat:


Canon II


Rule 2.00:  A judge should
avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in 
all
 activities.


Rule 2.01:  A judge should
so behave at all times as to promote public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary.


Only recently, the Court
restated in 
Atty. Lauro D. Gacayan, et al. v.
 
Hon Fernando Vil
Pamintuan
[29]
 
the reminder in the assailed Decision that:


â[A] judge's official conduct should be free from the
appearance of impropriety, and his personal behavior, not only upon the bench
should and in the performance of judicial duties, but also his everyday life
should be beyond reproach.â Thus, the Court in taking the respondent to task in

Sarah B. Vedana v. Judge Eudarlo B
. 
Valencia
[30]
 
minced
 
no
words when it said:


... his being a
public official, holding a position in the Judiciary and specifically entrusted
with the sacred duty of administering justice, breached Canon 2 of the Code of
Judicial Conduct and Canon 3 of the Canons of Judicial ethics which mandates
respectively, that âa judge should avoid impropriety in 
all
 activities',
and that 'a judge's official conduct should be free from the appearance of
impropriety, and his personal behavior, not only upon the bench and in the
performance of judicial duties, but also in everyday life, should be beyond
reproach.â These most exacting standards of decorum are demanded from
magistrates if only, in the language of Rule 2.01 of Canon 2 of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, to 'promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality
of the judiciary.â


The spirit and philosophy underlying these Canons is bast expressed
in 
Castillo v. Calanog
[31]


thus:


The Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of a judge
must be free of a whiff of impropriety not only with respect to his performance
of his judicial duties, but also to his behavior outside his sala and as a
private individual.  There is no
dichotomy of morality; a public official is also judged by his private
morals.  The Code dictates that a judge,
in order to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the
judiciary, must behave with propriety at 
all
 times.  As we have very recently explained, a
judge's official life can not simply be detached or separated from his personal
existence.  thus:


Being a subject of constant public
scrutiny, a judge should freely and willingly accept restrictions on conduct
that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.


A judge should personify judicial
integrity and exemplify honest public service.  The personal behavior of a judge, both in the performance of official
duties and in private life should be above suspicion.
[32]


Verily, no position is more demanding as regards moral
righteousness and uprightness of any individual than a seat on the Bench.  Within the hierarchy of courts, trial courts
stand as an important and visible symbol of government, especially considering
that as opposed to appellate courts, trial judges are those directly in contact
with the parties, their counsel and the communities which the judiciary is
bound to serve.  Occupying as he does an
exalted position in the administration of justice, a judge must pay a high
price for the honor bestowed upon him. Thus, the judge must comport himself at 
all

times in such manner that his conduct, official or otherwise, can bear the most
searching scrutiny of the public that looks up to him as the epitome of
integrity and justice.
[33]
 
In insulating the Bench from the unwarranted criticism, thus preserving
our democratic way of life, it is essential that judges, life Caesar's wife,
should be above suspicion.â


At the risk of sounding
trite, the Court once again reminds all those who don judicial robes to
maintain good moral character and at all times observe irreproachable behavior
so as not to outrage public decency.
[34]


Taking exception to the
Court's finding that his alibi is a mere afterthought, respondent judge further
insists that his defense "is authentic and not a mere concoction."
[35]


We remain unpersuaded.  The merits of respondent judge's defense as
well as the testimonial declarations of the witnesses he produced in support
thereof have already been discussed at length in the challenged Decision and to
dwell further on them herein would be superfluous.  Suffice
 
it to state in this regard that -


...It is settled that alibi is the weakest of all defenses.  It cannot prevail over the positive
identification of the accused by the witnesses who have no ill motive to
testify falsely.
[36]
 
Alibi
 
becomes less plausible when it is
corroborated
 
by relatives and friends who may not be impartial witnesses
.
[37]
 
More so when the corroborating
 
testimonies
are marred by discrepancies
.
[38]


Respondent judge finally
brands the charge of obstruction of justice as "an extortion attempt gone
awry"
[39]
 bewailing the Court's "expressed
inability ...to believe that âRegino would use his daughter Cecile for such an
ignoble purpose, especially if it will subject her to embarassrnent and even
stigma" saying that it "does not reflect [the] reality of the times.â
[40]


The foregoing
protestations of respondent Judge ring hollow because the Court's disbelief
that Regino would exploit Cecile for disgraceful ends is anchored on concrete
factual bases.  In disposing of respondent
judge's allegation that the obstruction of justice charge is a mere
âconcoctionâ, the Court citing with approval excerpts of the Investigating
justice's exhaustive findings, said:


â...[t]he evidence on
record shows that Panday and Cecile were complete strangers to each other when
they met in the afternoon of July 24, 1994.  There is no morsel of evidence on record, and Panday adduced none, to
prove that Cecile had any ill or devious motive to concoct the charge against
Panday and tergiversate her testimony. Cecile was just a third year high school
student.  She was made to believe by
Panday that he was a Judge.  Considering
her youth and her lowly station in life, she would not have dared concoct and
fabricate her claim that it was Panday, a Judge no less, who had sexual
intercourse with her in the Tigaon Bodega unless it was true.  It cannot be denied that, despite
intermittent assaults by media against the judiciary, the Judges, in the
province, are still looked upon with awe and respect by the citizenry by virtue
of their lofty positions in government.  We cannot believe that Cecile could muster courage to implicate Panday,
a Judge no less, unless her claims were true.  Absent any ill motive, the testimony of Cecile that it was Panday who
had intercourse with her must be accorded credence and full probative
weight."
[41]


The same thing can be said of Regino, Cecile's father, and his
testimony regarding Judge Panday's attempt to settle the case by offering him
the sum of one hundred fifty thousand pesos (P150,00.00).  Judge Panday alleges that Regino, along with
Cecile and certain members of the Lagonoy PNP, concocted the charges against
him to extort money from him knowing that he is about to retire from government
service and receive his retirement benefits.  This allegation is too far-fetched and improbable.  The Investigating Justice pointed out
correctly that Regino is a mere passenger jeepney driver while his daughter is
just a third year high school student.  It was not shown that they were even aware that Judge Panday is due to
retire from government service or that they know how much he is to receive by
way of retirement benefits.


â¦Moreover, Anita Panlilioâs denial
of her participation in brokering the agreement between Judge Panday and Regino
cannot prevail over Reginoâs positive and categorical testimony.  In fine, Judge Panday has failed to
convincingly show any ill-motive on the part of Cecile and Regino to testify
and to impute to him such charges.
[42]


The presumption is that
witnesses are not actuated by any improper motive absent any proof to the
contrary and
 
that their testimonies must accordingly be met with
considerable, if not conclusive, favor under the rules of evidence
[43]
 because it is not expected that said
witnesses would prevaricate and cause the damnation of one who brought them no
harm or injury.
[44]


With regard to the
statutory definition and requisites of the offense, Section 1 (a) of PD No.
1829 provides as follows:


SECTION 1. The penalty of 
prision correccional
 in its
maximum period, or a fine ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 pesos or both, shall be
imposed upon any person who knowingly or wilfully obstructs, impedes, frustrates
or delays the apprehension of suspects and the investigation and prosecution of
criminal cases by committing any of the following acts:


(a) 
preventing witnesses from testifying in any criminal
proceeding or from reporting the commission of any offense or the identity 
of
any offender/s by means
 of bribery
, misrepresentation, deceit, 
intimidation

force or 
threats
; xxx


All told, the Court
remains convinced that respondent judge's penalty is commensurate to his
misdeed.


WHEREFORE
, in view of all the foregoing, respondent
Judge Jose R. Panday's motion for reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of
merit.
