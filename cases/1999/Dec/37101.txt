RE:Â  REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT AND PHYSICAL INVENTORY OF PENDING CASES IN THE MTCC, BRANCH 1 AND THE RTC, BRANCHÂ  57, BOTH IN LUCENA CITY

R E S O L U T I O N




DE LEON, JR., J.:


On the basis of a physical inventory and audit conducted in May 1996 of the cases pending in Branch 57 of the Regional Trial Court of Lucena City, its Presiding Judge, Hon. Federico A. TaÃ±ada, was ordered, per our Resolution,
[1] 
dated August 13, 1996, to decide the twenty-one (21) criminal cases
[2]
 and six (6) civil cases
[3]
 which remained pending and unresolved beyond the 90-day reglementary period. Judge TaÃ±ada was also directed to submit his docket inventories for the periods from January to June 1994, July to December 1994, January to June 1995, and July to December 1995. His Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Luis N. Pedron, was likewise directed to submit the Monthly Report of Cases from January 1995 onwards.
On February 17, 1997, Judge TaÃ±ada, through Atty. Pedron, sent to this Court certified copies of decisions in thirteen (13) criminal cases. However, Judge TaÃ±ada neither justified his delay in the resolution of those cases nor explained his continued failure to decide the eight (8) other criminal cases and six (6) civil cases reported in the May 1996 audit. Thus, in the Resolution
[4]
 of June 17, 1997, we required him to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for such failure. As Atty. Pedron also continued to fail to submit the Monthly Report of Cases from January 1995 onwards, he, too, was ordered to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.
On June 10, 1998, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) reported that both Judge TaÃ±ada and Atty. Pedron remained defiant. We examined the records of the case and agreed with the OCA. Thus, in the Resolution
[5]
 of July 28, 1998, the Court held both Judge TaÃ±ada and Atty. Pedron in contempt of court. They were fined P20,000.00 and P10,000.00, respectively, and the Court also froze the salaries of Judge TaÃ±ada pending compliance with its Resolutions of August 13, 1996 and June 17, 1997.
Meantime, Atty. Pedron compulsorily retired on June 21, 1998.
On December 4, 1998, the Court Management Office (CMO) received the Monthly Report of Cases for January 1995 to August 1998 prepared and signed by Atty. Pedron and certified correct by Judge TaÃ±ada. However, the reports lacked the required dates when the cases listed therein were submitted for decision.
On February 16, 1999, the Court, adopting the conclusion of the OCA that continued disobedience to the orders of the Court constitutes gross insubordination, suspended Judge TaÃ±ada and ordered a second audit
[6]
 The team dispatched by the OCA to Lucena City conducted the second audit on July 28 and 29, 1999. While the results thereof included the finding that Judge TaÃ±ada had already decided nineteen (19) of the original twenty-one (21) criminal cases and four (4) of the original six (6) civil cases, the team discovered that there were additional twenty (20) criminal cases
[7]
 and eleven (11) civil cases
[8]
 that remained undecided beyond the 90-day reglementary period. Consequently, the OCA recommended that Judge TaÃ±ada be penalized with another fine of P20,000.00.
Judge TaÃ±ada applied for disability retirement, effective June 15, 1999, because he was suffering from organic brain syndrome, hypertension with cerebral infraction and central retinal vein occlusion of the left eye. Taking this into consideration, the OCA recommended that his suspension be lifted and his salaries from August 13, 1996 to June 14, 1999 be released. However, the OCA also recommended that the amount of P40,000.00 be deducted from his disability retirement benefits to answer for the P20,000.00 fine earlier imposed on him in the Resolution dated July 28, 1998 and for the additional fine of same amount for his failure to decide the thirty-one (31) other cases reported in the second audit.
The team also found out that Atty. Pedron failed, before his compulsory retirement, to submit his reports on the 
ex parte
 reception of evidence in Civil Case Nos. 94-45 and 95-13 to Hon. Ismael B. Sanchez, Pairing Judge of Branch 57 of the Regional Trial Court of Lucena City. Thus, the OCA recommended a second fine of P5,000.00 to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
In its Memorandum dated August 19, 1999, the OCA likewise recommended that:
â2. Mr. Manuel P. Marasigan, Officer-in-Charge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 57, Lucena City, be 
DIRECTED

[9]
Among the essential duties of a judge is to decide cases. Undue delay in the disposition of cases amounts to a denial of justice which, in turn, brings the courts into disrepute and ultimately erodes the faith and confidence of the public in the judiciary.
[10]
 Failure to decide a case within the reglementary period, without strong and justifiable reason, constitutes gross inefficiency warranting the imposition of administrative sanction on the defaulting judge.
[11]
