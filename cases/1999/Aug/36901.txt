For the period starting December 1996 up until March 1997, warrants of arrests, issued in 1,041 criminal cases, remained unserved. The cases were reflected to be pending in the court docket.
Finally, the Audit Team noted that the court had not been complying with Administrative Circular No. 90-94 (submission of Semestral Docket Inventory) since the second semester of 1994, and the Official Docket Book for criminal cases was not being used.
In its resolution of 24 March 1998, the Court resolved to:
"x x x (a) DIRECT: (1) Judge Francisco C. Villanueva to: (1-a) DECIDE within thirty (30) days from notice the following six (6) cases which he deemed submitted for decision and are already beyond the reglementary period, to wit: Criminal Cases Nos. 5469, 15282, 55607, 55608, 55609 and Civil Case No. 1994; (1-b) INFORM this Court within ten (10) days from notice whether or not the following cases submitted for his decision/resolution but still within the prescribed period during the time of audit have been decided/resolved by him, to wit: Criminal Case Nos. 49874, 49875, 32878, 32879, 32880, 32881, 51489, 65598, 30001, 33667, 33467, 34046, 40440, 40441, 40442, 40443, 40444, 40445, 48845, 18846, 48847, 48848, 48849, 48850, 48851, 48852, 48853, 48854, 48855, 48856, 48857, 48858, 48859, 48860, 48861, 48862, 40794, 63571, 63572, 63573, Civil Cases Nos. 15055, 17729, 15565, 17976, 17178, 10354, 10355, 10356 and 10357; (1-c) EXPLAIN in writing within ten (10) days from notice why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for his failure to decide/resolve the abovementioned cases; (2) Clerk of Court III Danilo R. Buenaventura, Branch Clerk of Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 36, Quezon City, to: (2-a) take appropriate action within ten (10) days from notice on (aa) the following 30 civil cases which have no initial action taken thereon since the date of filing, to wit: 17929, 18085, 17972, 17839, 17749, 17643, 17506, 16565, 16500, 15916, 15713, 804-E, 798-E, 15858, 15624, 15488, 16360, 14409, 17338, 17172, 16047, 16730, 16692, 15363, 15329, 15084, 14707, 14011, 13663, 13140 and (bb) the following 8 civil cases with no further proceedings for a considerable length of time, to wit: Civil Cases Nos. 17982, 17988, 17413, 16937, 14294, 15092, 15074 and 15219 and (2-b) EXPLAIN in writing also within ten (10) days from notice why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for the delay in the aforementioned cases and for failure to submit the Semestral Docket Inventory of cases since the second semester of 1994 and to submit the same within the same period."

Buenaventura stated that he was not able to attend to, and submit, the required semestral docket and inventory of cases since 1994 because of the tremendous increase in caseload, the court receiving an average of 100 cases monthly.
The Office of the Court Administrator, through Senior Deputy Court Administrator Reynaldo L. Suarez, following its evaluation of the matter, took to task respondents for failing to live up to their respective responsibilities and recommended that:
"1. Judge Francisco Villanueva, MeTC, Branch 36, Quezon City, be

"2. Mr. Danilo R. Buenaventura, Branch Clerk of Court, MeTC, Branch 30, Quezon City, be 
FINED
 P1,000.00 for his failure to submit the required Semestral Docket and Inventory of Cases with a warning that a repetition of the same act in the future will be dealt with more severely."
The Court accepts the findings of the OCA and concurs with it in its recommendation.
Indeed unacceptable is the explanation of Judge Villanueva. The Court is not unmindful of and does realize the heavy caseload that confronts most courts; it is for this reason precisely that it has been most sympathetic in acting on requests for extension of time submitted by judges. The period prescribed for the resolution of cases, however, is a legal mandate that cannot just be ignored even on account of pressure of work. The Court must still be informed by the judge of his difficulty in meeting with the prescribed deadlines and of the necessity of having the periods thereof correspondingly extended. Almost invariably, the Court responds favorably and grants a reasonable time for compliance with the rules but it would be wrong for a judge, on his own, to pass by a duty incumbent upon him.
It would additionally appear that Judge Villanueva has disregarded Administrative Circular No. 3-90
[3]
 requiring all trial courts to adopt the mandatory continuous trial system in accordance with (1) Administrative Circular No. 4
[4]
 to the effect that trial courts should, after arraignment, fix the specific dates needed to complete the presentation of evidence by the parties and conduct the trial without unnecessary postponements, and (2) Circular No. 1-89,
[5]
 which has established the guidelines to be observed by the trial courts in the conduct of such trials.
In his case, Danilo R. Buenaventura did not heed Administrative Circular No. 10-94
[6]
 directing Clerks of Court and Branch Clerks of Court to submit a docket Inventory Report every semester. The Court agrees with OCA that his similar excuse of a heavy caseload in their branch is not a valid justification for the infraction.
WHEREFORE,
 for failing to so act seasonably as aforementioned on the cases pending before him, Judge Francisco Villanueva is imposed a FINE of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos. For failing to submit the Semestral Docket and Inventory of Cases, Clerk of Court Danilo R. Buenaventura is imposed a FINE of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos. Any further infraction by either respondent will be dealt with severely.
SO ORDERED.
Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes,
 and 
Ynares-Santiago, JJ.,
