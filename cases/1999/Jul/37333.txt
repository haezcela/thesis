ROMERO, J.:


On March 25, 1999, the Mondragon Leisure and Resorts Corporation (hereafter referred to as Mondragon) filed a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 with this Court. Said petition sought the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 19, 1999 setting aside (1) the temporary restraining orders dated December 15 and 16, 1998 issued by Judge Yturralde in Civil Case No. 9242; and (2) the restraining orders dated December 15, December 22, 1998 and January 4, 1999, as well as the order to comment, issued by Judge Viola in Civil Case 8970.
Mondragon is the lessee of a 152.25 has. area in what used to be Clark Air Base, having leased the same from private respondent Clark Development Corporation (hereafter CDC) for a period of fifty years. Due to alleged violations by Mondragon of the lease agreement it had with CDC, specifically, over what CDC claims to be Mondragon's non-payment of the proper rent over the leased property, the latter sought to eject the former from the premises. In the course of the dispute, personnel of the Philippine National Police set up barricades around the Mimosa Regency Casino, one of the establishments operated by Mondragon in the leased area.
In order to prevent its ejectment, Mondragon filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 9242. The complaint, which prayed for a temporary restraining order, was raffled off to the sala of Judge Yturralde. Said judge granted the prayer for a restraining order.
In the interim, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (hereafter PAGCOR) likewise threatened to revoke Mondragon's authority to operate the Mimosa Regency Casino. Mondragon was, thus, constrained to file a complaint with the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City to restrain PAGCOR from revoking its license to operate a casino. The complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 8970, was raffled off to the sala of Judge Viola, who issued a restraining order, not only against PAGCOR, but also against CDC.
Aggrieved by the issuance of these restraining orders, CDC brought the matter to the Court of Appeals. On March 19, 1999, the appellate court set aside said restraining orders, prompting Mondragon to appeal to this Court. Subsequent to Mondragon's filing of the present petition, the Court deputized the Philippine National Police, who were still deployed around the area, to prevent persons from entering or leaving the premises of the casino.
On May 13, 1999, CDC filed a manifestation with the Court stating that they were willing to negotiate with Mondragon for the possible amicable settlement of the case. On May 17, 1999, Mondragon responded thereto by filing a manifestation stating their sincere desire to have the case amicably settled. In view of this development, the Court issued a resolution, dated May 18, 1999, granting the parties a non-extendible period of twenty days within which to submit an amicable settlement.
On June 28, 1999, the parties submitted a joint manifestation and motion to this Court stating that the parties had reached an amicable settlement, as embodied in a Compromise Agreement executed by the parties on even date, as follows:

The amount of rental due to CDC is the higher of the MGLR or PGR. The comparison of the PGR and MLGR shall be done on a monthly basis at MLRC's offices, starting on or before July 31, 1999.
