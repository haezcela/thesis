PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.
DOMINADOR TABION, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The Information charging appellant with rape failed to allege the minority of his daughter-victim. As a result, he cannot be convicted of qualified rape and sentenced to death, consistent with the Court's ruling in 
People v. Ramos
[1]
 that 
both
 the 
age
 of the victim and her 
relationship
 with the offender must be clearly alleged in the information. This doctrine is not a âmere technicalityâ; it rests on the constitutional principle that the accused are entitled âto be informed of the nature and causeâ of the accusations against them, as stated in the information to which they are asked to plead prior to trial. In other words, the accused in the present case can be convicted only of the crime alleged in the Information and duly proven during the trial. In sum, he can be held guilty of simple rape only, which was the crime charged in the Information and proven during the trial. 
The Case 
Before us for automatic review is the Decision
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 61 of Bogo, Cebu in Criminal Case No. B-00121, convicting Dominador Tabion of qualified rape and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death. The case arose from the Information
[3]
 dated October 30, 1996, filed by 3rd Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Eric F. Menchavez, charging appellant as follows: 
 
"That on the 11th day of May, 1996 at 9:30 o'clock in the morning, more or less, in Sitio Bagong Lipunan, Barangay Kangka-ibe, Municipality of Bantayan, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and with the use of a hunting knife and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge [of] his daughter REGIN
[4]
 TABION, against her will and consent." 
 
Appellant was arraigned on April 3, 1997. Duly assisted by his counsel de oficio, he entered a plea of not guilty.
[5]
 Thereafter, trial ensued. 
The Facts 
Version of the Prosecution 
 
The Office of the Solicitor General presents the facts, as viewed by the prosecution, in this wise:
[6]
 
 
âOn May 11, 1996 at about 9:30 in the morning, complainant Regin Tabion, a single girl barely sixteen (16) years old, was at their home in Sitio Bagong Lipunan, Barangay Kangka-Ibe, Municipality of Bantayan, Province of Cebu, weaving baskets when accused Dominador Tabion, who was her father and her only companion at the time, as her mother had gone to the town proper while her younger brothers were playing in the house of her aunt, called her to wash the plates. She complied. 
 
âAfter washing the plates, she was ordered by the accused to get inside her parents' room. She obeyed. 
 
âWhen she was already inside the room, the accused, who was at the time wearing a T-shirt and short pants and holding a ten (10) to twelve (12) inch long hunting knife in his right hand, ordered her to lie down on the bed and to remove her panty. At the time she was wearing a T-shirt and a skirt on top of her bra and white panty. The accused then told her: "do you see this knife, if you will resist, do you know what I will do, I will thrust this knife to your neck and you know me". Afraid of the accused, she reluctantly lay on the bed and removed her panty. Thereupon, the accused separated and spread out her legs, lay on top of her, pulled out his penis and thrust it into her vagina. She felt pain, a tearing pain inside her vagina. The accused then made a series of push and pull or pumping motions for about one (1) minute, all the while embracing her with his left hand and pointing the knife at her neck with his right hand. The accused's pumping motions and the intense pain she felt in her vagina made her to urinate but blood flowed out instead. She could not resist the accused because she was afraid of him and of his threat to kill her and her family. 
 
âAfter consummating the sexual act, the accused went out, and she was left in the room crying. She did not tell her mother of what happened because her father warned her he would kill all of them should she tell her. 
 
âTwo days later, the accused again ordered her to get inside the room and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. The accused had sexually assaulted her ten times up to July 10, 1996. 
 
âAfter the tenth sexual assault against her she could no longer bear the pain of what her father had been doing to her, so she told her mother everything and complained to the authorities. 
 
âOn July 22, 1996, she underwent medical examination by Dra. Nayda P. Bautista, a resident physician, at the Bantayan District Hospital. Her findings, which were reduced in writing, were as follows: 
 
PHY. EXAM. FINDINGS: 
 
 
A. Easily admits two (2) examining fingers. 
 
B. Vaginal OS with old healed lacerations at 5 x 7 o'clock positions. 
 
C. Cervical OS non-tender but erythematous. 
 
"SEC. EXAM. 
 
1. Cervic -- firm, non-tender 
 
2. Adnaxae -- non-tender 
 
3. Discharges -- whitish, non-foul smelling." 
 
âElaborating on her findings, Dra. Bautista declared that the patient was no longer a virgin; that there was evidence of penetration of male organ into the vagina of the patient; that in her opinion there were several insertions of the male organ into the vagina; and that the old healed lacerations at the lower part of the opening could be two (2) months old, more or less, which coincided with the patient's statement that she was raped by her on May 11, 1996.â (Citations omitted) 
 
Version of the Defense 
 
On the other hand, appellant presented his version of the facts, as follows:
[7]
 
 
âEvidence for the defense shows that on May 11, 1996 at about 8:00 oâclock in the morning, herein accused-appellant went to his place at work at Bagong Lipunan, Bantayan, where he is a self-employed man doing some handicrafts. From their residence to his working place, it would take him fifty (50) minutes to negotiate such distance which is about one (1) kilometer. Once he left the house in the morning, he usually returns in the evening. At the time said incident allegedly happened, he testified that some of his children were in their house while the others were in Iloilo. He denied having raped her daughter and that the allegations made by the complainant were all fabricated as the latter and her mother had a grudge against the accused-appellant. He told his daughter and his wife to stop their vice of drinking with their male friends. However, instead of following his advice, they got angry with him. As a result, the couple kept on quarreling and never had a good relationship since then. When he was already in jail, he wrote his wife and asked why she charged him of rape, however, his letter remained unanswered as she refused to talk to him. (TSN, October 21, 1997, pp. 2-7; TSN, October 30, 1997, pp. 1-6; TSN November 11, 1997, pp. 1-7)â 
 
Ruling of the Trial Court 
Assessing the complaining witness and her testimony, the trial judge wrote:
[8]
 
 
"[During] the entire testimony of the complainant, the Court x x x observed her demeanor and behavior in the narration of [the] facts of the incident. The Court observed her sincerity in testifying against her own father. She show[ed] sign of coolness, calmness and her answer flow[ed] naturally, as if the incident was still fresh in her memory. She appear[ed] forlorn, desolate, lonely but courageous enough to narrate how her father rape[d] her on May 11, 1996 and repeated it two (2) days thereafter. 
 
"There was no motive for her to testif[y] falsely against her father or to falsely fabricate in so serious and heinous a crime if it is not true that she was rape[d]. 
 
"The statement of the victim that she was rape[d] by her father was corroborated by Dra. Nayda Bautista when she testified that the old healed lacerations present at the time of the examination coincide[d] [with] the patient[â]s statements that she was allegedly rape[d] on May 11, 1996 or it may be two (2) months old, more or less (Tsn, Dra. Bautista, July 22, 1997, p. 9).

x x x 
 
"The testimony of complainant is replete with details of the incident, unshaken and unwavering even on cross-examination and that it is hard to fabricate and [manufacture] the sequence of event[s] which would seriously cast dishonor on her maidenhood. 
 
"The complainant is young, she is only 16 years old and it would be unnatural to expose herself to social humiliation, go to the doctor for examination and expose her parts and undergo the agony of a public trial, if such is not the truth." 
 
Describing the appellant's defenses of denial and alibi as "inherently weak," the trial judge cited extant jurisprudence: "For alibi to be given weight and credit, it must be established that it would be physically impossible for him to be present at the scene of the incident or crime"; and denial "cannot prevail over the positive and unshaken testimony of the x x x the complainant." The trial court further held that "[t]he motive proffered by the accused is not so strong enough to overthrow the positive and affirmative declaration of the complainant." 
Additionally, the court 
a quo
 noted that "not even [appellant's] wife ever visited him in jail. Not one of his children, 11 children, ever visited him. It only shows that his wife and children condemned the accused [for] what he had done to [his] daughter. He was then left alone. He is being ostracized by his own family. They cannot forgive the bestial act of their father." 
Concluding, the trial court said that it "gives more weight and credit to the testimony of the complainant x x x that she was indeed rape[d] and the rapist was her father and that she was sixteen (16) years old at the time she was sexually abused." It thus disposed as follows: 
 
"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Rep. Act No. 7659, Sec. 11 as amended and hereby imposes upon the accused, Dominador Tabion, the penalty of death." 
 
In view of the penalty imposed, this case was elevated direct to this Court for automatic review.
[9]
 
Issue 
In his Brief,
[10]
 appellant makes this lone assignment of error:
[11]
 
 
"The court 
a quo
 gravely erred in finding that the guilt of the accused-appellant for the crime charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt." 
 
This Courtâs Ruling 
The appellant may be convicted only of simple, not qualified, rape. Hence, his penalty should be reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
. 
Main Issue: 
Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence 
 
In his Brief, appellant pleads for acquittal, on the anemic argument that the private complainant instituted the criminal charge, merely because she hated him so much for his having been a member of the NPA (New People's Army). Without much ado, he submits that the evidence of the prosecution was not enough to overcome the constitutional presumption of his innocence.
[12]
 
The settled guiding principles in reviewing rape cases are: (1) to accuse a man of rape is easy, but it is difficult for the accused to disprove, though he may be innocent; (2) considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[13]
 Corollary to these is the principle that when a victim of rape says that she was defiled, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her, and so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.
[14]
 The application of this doctrine becomes even more compelling when the culprit is a close relative of the victim.
[15]
 
After meticulously perusing the records and evaluating the evidence, the Court is convinced beyond doubt of the credibility and the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence establishing that appellant raped his own daughter Regin. As the solicitor general observed, the testimony of the victim is replete with details; she was categorical, straightforward, unshaken and unwavering even during the grueling cross-examination. She candidly related her sordid tale thus:
[16]

Q. Why not? 
 
A. I was afraid because he warned me that he will kill all of us if I tell my mother." 
 
In the incestuous rape of a minor, proof of force and violence exerted by the aggressor is not essential. The moral and physical ascendancy of the father over his daughter-victim is sufficient to cow her into submission to his bestial desires.
[17]
 Fear oftentimes overwhelms the victim. In the instant case, the appellant enhanced his physical supremacy over his daughter by holding a knife to her neck. In the face of such brutal intimidation, she knuckled under, thus enabling him to satisfy his incestuous lust. 
The victim's testimony was corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Nayda P. Bautista on July 22, 1996:
[18]
 
 
"PHY. EXAM. FINDINGS: 
 
 
A. Easily admits two (2) examining fingers. 
 
B. Vaginal OS with old healed lacerations at 5x7 o'clock positions. 
 
C. Cervical OS non-tender but erythematous. 
 
SEC. EXAM: 
 
 
1. Cervix - firm, non-tender 
 
2. Adnaxae - non-tender 
 
3. Discharges - whitish, non-foul smelling." 
 
Explaining her report, Dr. Bautista testified
[19]
 that the victim's vagina admitted two fingers, signifying penetration by a male organ. The two-month old healed lacerations of the skin and the underlying tissue could have been caused by a "blunt force" inflicted at a time coinciding with the patient's statement that she was raped on May 11, 1996. These medical observations clearly support the incident of rape. 
As it is, appellant's trite defenses of alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony of the complainant.
[20]
 As a rule, alibi is viewed with suspicion and received with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable, but also because it can easily be fabricated. To prosper, such defense must be convincing enough to preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the 
locus criminis
 at the time of the incident.
[21]
 Such, however, is not the case herein. 
Appellant simply claimed that the whole day of May 11, 1996, he was at his place of work, which was about one kilometer away from his house.
[22]
 While it would ordinarily take him fifty (50) minutes to trudge the rough trail, it would not be impossible for him to do so in only fifteen (15) minutes if he were to walk fast. This he readily admitted during cross-examination.
[23]
 Thus, it was not at all impossible for him to have gone back to his house to rape his own daughter during that fateful morning. 
As regards appellant's contention that private complainant merely hated him for having been a former NPA, we agree with the solicitor general that, even if true, such shallow reasoning could not have moved Regin to falsely accuse her own father of the heinous crime of rape and, in the process, subject herself and her family to social humiliation, to the disgrace and the trauma attendant to a prosecution for rape, and the lifetime shame incident thereto. Indeed, no young girl of decent repute would allow an examination of her private parts or subject herself to the shame, embarrassment and humiliation of a public trial, if she has not in fact been raped.
[24]
 
Proper Penalty 
 
The Constitution grants the accused the inviolable right âto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.â
[25]
 Doctrinally, this means that every element of the offense must be alleged in the complaint or information.
[26]
 The accused "is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense"
[27]
 charged. 
Republic Act 7659, which took effect on December 31, 1993, imposes the death penalty in the event rape is attended by any one of the âseven new special circumstancesâ enumerated in the said statute.
[28]
 
Pursuant to the above-mentioned constitutional right of the accused and the extant jurisprudence on the subject, we have held that the death penalty may be imposed only if the
 information has alleged and the evidence has proven both the age of the victim and her relationship to the offender. In People v. Perez,
[29]
 the Court ruled that because âthe circumstance that [the victim] was less than eighteen years of age at the time of the rape was never, in any manner, stated in the Information,â the accused could be convicted only of simple rape and sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
, not death. We said that it was the concurrence of the minority of the victim and her relationship with the offender that would have qualified the rape as heinous and thus justified the imposition of the supreme penalty.
[30]
 
In the instant case, the age of the victim was not alleged in the Information filed against appellant. Because not 
all
 the elements of qualified rape were alleged in the Information, the death sentence cannot be meted out to him. 
The Court further notes that the trial court failed to impose upon appellant the indemnity 
ex delicto
 provided by the Revised Penal Code. The award thereof to the rape victim is mandatory.
[31]
 Furthermore, in 
People v. Prades
[32]
 we also held that in the crime of rape, moral damages may be additionally awarded to the victim in such amount as the Court deems just. We declared: "[T]he fact that complainant has suffered the trauma of mental, physical and psychological sufferings which constitute the bases for moral damages [is] too obvious to still require the recital thereof at the trial by the victim, since the Court itself assumes and acknowledges such agony on her part as gauge of her credibility. What exists by necessary implication as being ineludibly present in the case need not go through the superfluity of still being proved through a testimonial charade."
[33]
 
Moreover, in the crime of rape, the relationship between the offender and the victim is aggravating.
[34]
 This circumstance justifies the imposition of exemplary damages as well. 
Based on the foregoing, we thus award to the victim P50,000 as indemnity 
ex delicto
, another P50,000 as moral damages and P25,000 as exemplary damages. 
WHEREFORE
, the appealed Decision is hereby 
MODIFIED
. Appellant Dominador Tabion is found 
GUILTY
 of simple, not qualified, rape and is sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
. He is further ordered to 
PAY
 Regin Tabion P50,000 as indemnity 
ex delicto
, another P50,000 as moral damages and P25,000 as exemplary damages. Costs against appellant.

It admits two (2) examining fingers[;] could you please explain, what is the significance of the findings, when the vagina easily admits the insertion of two (2) examining fingers. 
 
A. The significance after examining the patient using internal examinations, if the vagina admits easily 1 finger it signifies that the patient is no longer a virgin[;] [t]hat in her case upon examining, it easily admits 2 fingers[;] that the patient [--] there is evidence of penetration of male organ into the vagina of the patient. 
 
Q. And in your expert opinion, you mean that there is previous or several penetration of the penis into the vagina? 
 
A. There are several insertions of the male organ into the vagina and maybe a single insertion of the male organ may even cause [it;] there is a previous [laceration]. 
 
COURT: 
 
The effect of repeated push and pull, pumping. 
 
A. It maybe result of push and pull insertion. 
 
FISCAL MAÃALAC: 
 
Q. Considering it admits 2 fingers, it means to say, more or less, the victim is no longer a virgin and it is possible that she ha[s] had several intercourse in the past? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Finding No. 2 - Vaginal OS with old healed lacerations at 5x7 o'clock positions. Could you please tell us what this means? 
 
A. Where there is [an] opening it is called vaginal OS. When [I] examined the patient there are old lacerations [in] the skin and the underlining tissue[;] there is tear in the underlining tissue which maybe caused by blunt force and it is an old healed [laceration] at the lower part of the opening. 
 
Q. Now, this [laceration] at 5x7 o'clock, does this also mean that there have been insertions of the penis into the vagina causing lacerations in order to admit entry of the penis? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, in this particular case, in your own medical expert opinion, judging from the healed lacerations, could you tell us how old, more or less, [these] injuries were at the time you examined her on July 22, 1996? 
 
A. Yes, when the patient was examined, the findings that there was an old healed [laceration], meaning that the lacerations present x x x may coincide [with] the patient's statement that she was allegedly raped on May 11, 1996[;] it may be 2 months old lacerations, it may be 2 months old more or less, there is possibility of the injuries sustained on May 11, 1996. 
 
Q. Last Finding No. 4 - Cervix firm, non-tender, Adnaxae non-tender, discharges-whitish, non-foul smelling. Could you please tell us, what is the significance of this particular [finding]? 
 
A Since the patient was examined, she sustained old lacerations, this [finding --] cervix-firm, non-tender [--] more or less rules out any recent [one], since the opening easily admits 2 or 3 fingers that is only to rule out any internal injuries."
