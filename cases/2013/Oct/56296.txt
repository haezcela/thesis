CARPIO, J.:


The Case
Before this Court are: (1) the Administrative Complaint
[1]
 dated 10 June 2005 filed by Atty. Jessie Tuldague (Tuldague), Clerk of Court VI, Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Cabarroguis, Quirino (RTC), and Atty. Alfredo Balajo, Jr. (Balajo), 2
nd
 Assistant Provincial Prosecutor, Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, Cabarroguis, Quirino, against now retired Judge Moises Pardo (Judge Pardo), Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 31, for Corruption and Violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct; (2) the Administrative Complaint
[2]
 dated 5 July 2005 filed by Tuldague and Balajo against Jaime Calpatura (Calpatura), Legal Researcher and Officer-In-Charge, Branch Clerk of Court of RTC, Branch 32, for Corruption; and (3) the Report on the Judicial Audit and Investigation
[3]
 conducted in the same court.
The Facts
The antecedent facts of these cases, as culled from the records, are as follows:
A.M. No. RTJ-05-1962
Tuldague and Balajo allege that Judge Pardo committed corruption and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, to wit:
1.  In Criminal Case No. 1427, entitled 
People v. Rosendo Discipulo
, Judge Pardo allegedly asked and received P6,000.00 from Rosendo Discipulo (Rosendo), in exchange for a favorable decision on his application for probation.
On 28 February 2005, Rosendo was convicted for violation of Republic Act No. 6425. Balajo alleged that after the promulgation of the decision, Rosendoâs counsel immediately filed a written application for probation accurately quoting the penalty imposed.
[4]
 Rosendo testified that Calpatura sent an emissary to ask P10,000.00 from him, in order for Judge Pardo to act favorably on his application for probation.
On 28 March 2005, Calpatura and Judge Pardo allegedly sent text messages to Rosendo. Calpatura allegedly instructed him to give P3,000.00 to Dominador Pascua (Dominador) while Judge Pardo asked him to go to his house in the evening. Thereafter, Rosendo allegedly gave P3,000.00 to Dominador. At 7:30 p.m. of the same day, Rosendo, together with Fr. Teodoro Lazo (Fr. Lazo) and spouses Palmer and Irene Natividad, went to Judge Pardoâs house. They had a âdrinking congressâ until 10:00 p.m. Before leaving, Rosendo allegedly gave P6,000.00 to Judge Pardo in the presence of his driver, Ramil S. Alonzo (Alonzo).
2.  In Land Registration Case No. 223-2002, Judge Pardo allegedly obtained P1,000.00 from petitioner John F. Toribio (Toribio) for a speedy release of a copy of the granted petition, sometime in December 2002.
3.  In Criminal Case No. 1581, entitled 
People v. Johny Kimayong
, Judge Pardo allegedly asked and received one deer from accused Johny Kimayong (Kimayong) in exchange for a favorable decision. Balajo testified that on 21 February 2003, the jail guard mistakenly gave him a letter, containing the information that âJudge Pardo demanded and was given a live deer in exchange for a court favor to Johny Kimayong.â
[5]
4.  Judge Pardo allegedly received P10,000.00 from Richard Calpito (Calpito), in exchange for endorsing him to the position of Process Server of RTC, Branch 31. Judge Pardo also allegedly received a cow from Michael T. Garingan (Garingan), in exchange for endorsing him as Utility in the Office of the Clerk of Court.
5.  On 29 June 2002, Judge Pardo allegedly ordered Lugeorge N. Discipulo (Lugeorge), Electrician II of the Maintenance Section of the RTC, to take out two (2) cans of coat master paint from the Hall of Justice. Lugeorge testified that on 30 June 2002, he brought and used the two cans of paint in Judge Pardoâs house. Judge Pardo allegedly ordered him to get another paint, but he no longer complied. According to him, Tuldague already discovered the missing cans of paint and had it noted in the security guardâs logbook.
In his Comment/Answer dated 9 August 2005,
[6]
 Judge Pardo vehemently denied the allegations of Tuldague, Balajo, Lugeorge and Rosendo.
Judge Pardo denied that Rosendo gave him money for his probation. Judge Pardo presented Fr. Lazo, who testified that Rosendo went with him to Judge Pardoâs house to thank the judge. Fr. Lazo stated that he did not see Rosendo hand anything to Judge Pardo during their stay. Judge Pardo also narrated that on 4 July 2005, he visited Fr. Lazo in his convent. Fr. Lazo then confronted Rosendo, who admitted that he was forced by his cousin Lugeorge to sign the Affidavit. On Balajoâs accusation, Judge Pardo stated that he immediately called the attention of Rosendoâs counsel in open court when he quoted the penalty imposed.
Judge Pardo denied the charges that he obtained P1,000.00 from Toribio and a live deer from Kimayong. He also denied receiving P10,000.00 and a cow from Calpito and Garingan in exchange for endorsing them to vacant positions in the RTC. Judge Pardo claimed that these allegations were unsupported by concrete evidence. He further argued that the letter allegedly given to Balajo was obtained illegally and in violation of the privacy of communication.
Judge Pardo likewise denied ordering Lugeorge to take two cans of paint for use in his house. He narrated that during the wake of Lugeorgeâs mother-in-law, Lugeorge confessed that he took the cans of paint and gave one to Alonzo.
Finally, he alleged that Tuldague filed this complaint to get even because:  (a) he enjoined Tuldague from signing applications for leave of absence of employees, which he used to do; (b) he recalled Process Servers Calpito and Levi Prestoza (Prestoza), who used to be under Tuldagueâs disposal; (c) he issued a memorandum prohibiting Tuldague from serving summons before the raffle of cases; (d) he stopped the practice of filing all pleadings with the Office of the Clerk of Court and limited it to initiatory pleadings only; and (e) he stopped sharing the conduct of raffle of foreclosure proceedings with Tuldague. Judge Pardo claimed that Balajo detested him for noticing that Balajo would refuse to submit object evidence when he rested his case.
A.M. OCA IPI No. 05-2243-P
In this case, Tuldague and Balajo accuse Calpatura of corruption, in cahoots with Judge Pardo, to wit:
1.  Calpatura allegedly approached litigants and offered them assistance provided they would give him money or animals.
In the same criminal case against Rosendo, Calpatura allegedly sent an emissary to ask for P10,000.00 so that Judge Pardo would decide favorably Rosendoâs probation. On 28 March 2005, Calpatura allegedly sent Rosendo a text message, stating to give him P3,000.00, through Dominador.
In Civil Case No. 292, the plaintiff Alberto Gorospe (Gorospe) testified that his friend Jose CabaÃ±ero (CabaÃ±ero) introduced him to Calpatura while they were following up this case in the RTC. Sometime in July 2004, Gorospe, together with CabaÃ±ero, allegedly met Calpatura in the Cabarroguis public market.  Calpatura allegedly urged him to buy hard drinks and 
pulutan
.  Gorospe agreed because he was seeking help with his case.  Then, sometime in November 2004, Calpatura allegedly asked him to prepare a goat for Judge Pardoâs birthday.  Judge Pardo allegedly instructed Gorospe to give him the goat through Calpatura.  Thereafter, Calpatura allegedly asked him again for money.
Juanito Pascua (Juanito) likewise testified that Calpatura visited him in jail to ask for two goats. Judge Pardo allegedly instructed Calpatura to ask for the goats in order to expedite his release from jail. Thus, Juanito gave the two goats for Judge Pardo to Calpatura. Calpatura allegedly asked Juanito again for another goat. After Juanitoâs acquittal, Calpatura allegedly ordered him to repair a bed without payment.
2. Calpatura alledgedly acted as "fixer" and "bagman" for Judge Pardo in  cases where the accused deposited cash bonds. Both Calpatura and Judge Pardo allegedly shared with the released cash bonds thereafter.
In Criminal Case No. 1468, Aurelia Diaz (Diaz) testified that Calpatura and Prestoza asked for her released cash bond amounting to P16,000.00, so that the estafa case against her would be dismissed. Diaz narrated that on 14 October 2002, Judge Pardo asked her if she would give him the released cash bond amounting to P16,000.00. Diaz agreed but asked Judge Pardo to acknowledge its receipt. Then, Judge Pardo allegedly called her lawyer, Atty. Edwin Betguen (Betguen). Betguen came and asked Diaz to go with him to the comfort room. Calpatura and Prestoza thereafter appeared. Then, Betguen allegedly received the P16,000.00 from Diaz.
On the other hand, Tuldague and Naty Fernando (Fernando) narrated that in the afternoon of 12 February 2003, Diaz, Cezar Diaz and Procopio Castro approached Tuldague to inquire about their rice thresher, which was executed upon Diazâs conviction of estafa. Diaz then complained to Tuldague that she was misled into believing that her case would be dismissed if she gave P10,000.00, or part of her cash bond, to Betguen and Calpatura. Fernando testified that he heard Diaz complain to Tuldague.
3.  Calpatura allegedly bragged to court litigants about drafting decisions and his closeness to Judge Pardo.
4.  Finally, Calpatura allegedly projected himself as a lawyer even though he did not pass the bar.
In his Comment/Answer dated 30 August 2005,
[7]
 Calpatura essentially denied the allegations against him. He denied that he offered assistance to litigants in exchange for money or animals and that he was a âfixerâ and âbagmanâ of Judge Pardo.
Calpatura denied receiving P3,000.00 from Rosendo through Dominador. He presented Dominador, who testified that Rosendo did not give him money on 28 March 2005. However, Calpatura admitted that Lugeorge requested him to offer Rosendoâs cash bond to Judge Pardo for his acquittal. He turned down the offer since he knew Judge Pardoâs strictness and non-acceptance of bribes.
Calpatura alleged that Gorospeâs accusations were purely concocted and fabricated. Calpatura presented CabaÃ±ero, who testified that he never introduced Gorospe to Calpatura and neither did they meet Calpatura in the Cabarroguis public market. CabaÃ±ero instead insisted that it was a certain Ramiterre, whom he introduced to Calpatura and who was with them in the Cabarroguis public market.
[8]
Calpatura likewise refuted Juanitoâs accusations and offered the Certification issued by Benjamin Galapon, Provincial Warden, Cabarroguis, Quirino. The Certification states: âJaime Calpatura did not visit the Provincial Warden Office since he was transferred from PENRE Office to the [RTC], Cabarroguis, Quirino.â
[9]
Calpatura denied obtaining money from Diaz regarding her estafa case. He alleged that Diazâs Affidavit was self-serving and executed upon the instance of Tuldague and Balajo. He likewise insisted that Fernandoâs testimony was purely fabricated and concocted.
Finally, he claimed that the allegations against him were products of instigations with ill-motive brought about by complainantsâ illegitimate and capricious ambitions. He alleged that Tuldague sought to be free from constructive suggestions and corrections on his wrong office actions, i.e. issuance of summons before the raffle of cases. He likewise claimed that Balajo harbored ill-feelings against him since he questioned his issuance of commitment orders.
A.M. No. 05-10-661-RTC
On 15 August to 19 August 2005, a judicial audit was conducted in the RTC of Cabarroguis, Quirino, based on the directive of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) and Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. to investigate Judge Pardo. On 19 September 2005, the audit team submitted their initial report providing, among others, that in Branches 31 and 32 of the RTC, Judge Pardo, as presiding and pairing judge, accumulated a total of: (a) forty-four (44) cases without further action or settings for a considerable length of time; (b) seven (7) cases submitted for decision or resolution but already beyond the reglementary period to decide or resolve; and (c) one (1) case not yet set for hearing.
[10]
In a resolution dated 18 october 2005,
[11]
 the court 
En Banc
, upon recommendation by the OCA, resolved to: (a) consolidate the instant judicial audit and investigation report with the complaints against Judge Pardo; (b) include Calpatura as respondent in the charge of corruption; and (c) refer the consolidated cases to Justice Alfredo M. Marigomen (Justice Marigomen), Consultant, OCA, for investigation, report and recommendation within 60 days from the termination of the formal hearing.
In a Resolution dated 4 April 2006,
[12]
 the Court 
En Banc
, resolved to redocket the complaint, amend the earlier resolution and limit the charges against Judge Pardo to: (a) corruption through, among others, sharing of cash bonds; (b) demanding money or live animals in exchange for endorsing applicants for vacant positions; and (c) taking of court property specifically two big cans of coat master paint allocated for the painting of the Hall of Justice.
On 27 April 2006, 25 May 2006, and 29 June 2006, Justice Marigomen conducted an investigation at the Hall of Justice, Cabarroguis, Quirino. Complainants presented eight (8) witnesses, namely: Rosendo, Lugeorge, Gorospe, Diaz, Fernando, Juanito, Tuldague, and Balajo. On the other hand, respondents presented seven (7) witnesses, namely: Fr. Lazo, Dominador, CabaÃ±ero, Madarang, Galapon, Calpatura, and Judge Pardo.
Meanwhile, based on the initial report on the judicial audit, which was adopted by the OCA in its Memorandum Report dated 28 April 2006,
[13]
 this Court issued a Resolution dated 20 June 2006,

[15]
x x x x
In his Letter-Compliance dated 8 August 2006,
[16]
 Judge Pardo submitted the certified true copies of Orders and Decisions he rendered in RTC, Branch 31. In his Letter-Compliance dated 9 August 2006,
[17]
 Judge Pardo likewise attached copies of his Medical Certificate, Orders, Resolutions and Decisions for Branch 32. Judge Pardo explained in his letter that he had been suffering from chronic hypertensive cardio vascular disease with temporary rheumatoid arthritis since 1 March 2005.
In a Resolution dated 18 October 2006,
[18]
 this Court, through the Second Division, resolved to consolidate A.M. OCA IPI No. 05-2243-P with A.M. No. RTJ-05-1962.
In a Resolution dated 14 December 2009, this Court, through the First Division, approved Judge Pardoâs application for optional retirement effective 1 July 2009. However, we held in abeyance the payment of his retirement benefits until the final resolution of this case.
The Report and Recommendations of the OCA
In its Report dated 3 June 2010,
[19]
 the OCA found Judge Pardo liable for violating Section 1, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.
[20]
 The OCA found that Judge Pardo did not deny he had a drinking spree with Rosendo, for more than two hours in the evening of 28 March 2005. Thus, the OCA found this act disturbing and improper since Rosendo had a pending application for probation with Judge Pardo at that time.
As for the charges of (1) corruption against both Judge Pardo and Calpatura, (2) taking of court property, and (3) endorsing of applicants in exchange for money or animals against Judge Pardo only, the OCA noted that the complainants failed to substantiate their charges. The complainants did not have direct knowledge of their charges and the witnesses they presented were not credible to substantiate their claims.
Accordingly, the OCA recommended that:
1.  the charge of corruption against respondents Judge Moises M. Pardo (now retired), formerly of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 31, Cabarroguis, Quirino, and Jaime B. Calpatura, Legal Researcher of the said court, as well as the charges of demanding money or live animals in exchange for indorsing applicants for vacant positions and taking of court property against respondent Judge Pardo, be DISMISSED for insufficiency of evidence;
2.  Judge Pardo be FINED in the amount of P20,000.00 for violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, which shall be deducted from his retirement benefits; and
3.  the matter regarding the judicial audit conducted in Branches 31 and 32 of the Regional Trial Court, Cabarroguis, Quirino be now considered CLOSED and TERMINATED, insofar as Judge Pardo is concerned.
[21]
The Ruling of the Court
The Court agrees with the recommendations of the OCA but modifies the amount of the recommended fine.
In administrative proceedings, the complainants bear the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, the allegations in the complaint.
[22]
 Substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, bare allegations of misconduct cannot prevail over the presumption of regularity in the performance of judicial duty.
[23]
In A.M. No. RTJ-05-1962, complainants Tuldague and Balajo bear the burden of proving their allegations against Judge Pardo, which we limited to three acts: (a) corruption through, among others, sharing of cash bonds; (b) demanding money or live animals in exchange for endorsing applicants for vacant positions; and (c) taking of court property specifically two big cans of coat master paint allocated for the painting of the Hall of Justice. Since the charges hurled against Judge Pardo are grave in nature, the evidence against him should be competent and derived from direct knowledge.
[24]
However, as the OCA observed, complainants did not have direct knowledge of their charges and merely relied on their witnesses to testify on the alleged wrongful acts of Judge Pardo.
To determine the credibility and probative weight of the testimony of a witness, such testimony must be considered in its entirety and not in truncated parts.
[25]
 To determine which contradicting statements of a witness are to prevail as to the truth, the other evidence received must be considered.
[26]
On the charge of corruption, complainants only presented Rosendo to testify that he gave P6,000.00 to Judge Pardo in the latterâs house. He alleged that he likewise gave P3,000.00 to Calpatura, through Dominador. However, Rosendoâs statements remain uncorroborated as he did not present Alonzo, who allegedly saw him give the money to Judge Pardo. On the other hand, Judge Pardo presented Fr. Lazo, who testified that he did not see Rosendo give money to Judge Pardo in his house. Calpatura likewise presented Dominador, who testified that Rosendo never gave him money.
Rosendoâs testimony also contains material inconsistencies, which gravely affected his credibility. Contrary to Rosendoâs statement in his Affidavit
[27]
 that Calpatura sent an emissary to ask for P10,000.00, Rosendo testified on cross-examination that Calpatura sent him a text message, while Judge Pardo called him to ask for the money.
[28]
 In his Affidavit, Rosendo claimed that Calpatura only sent a text message on 28 March 2005, but on cross-examination, he stated that Calpatura also sent a text message on 28 February 2005.
[29]
 It is well to note that when a serious and inexplicable discrepancy is present between a previously executed sworn statement of a witness and his testimonial declarations with respect to oneâs participation in a serious imputation such as bribery, such discrepancy raises grave doubt on the veracity of the witnessâ account.
[30]
On the charge that Judge Pardo demanded money or live animals to endorse applicants for vacant positions, Tuldagueâs allegation remains unsubstantiated. Toribio, Kimayong, Calpito, and Garingan, from whom Judge Pardo allegedly asked for money and animals, were not presented. In 
Aldecoa-Delorino v. Abellanosa
,
[31]
 the charges of abuse of authority, harassment and oppression were dismissed by the Court when the concerned employees did not submit their Affidavits or appear during the investigation of the administrative case. The Court cannot give credence to charges based on mere suspicion and speculation.
[32]
Finally, on the charge that Judge Pardo ordered Lugeorge to bring court property, specifically two cans of paints, to his house, we likewise find the evidence presented to be insufficient. Only Lugeorgeâs testimony was presented. The security guards who allegedly saw the taking were not presented. On the other hand, the veracity of Lugeorgeâs testimony is doubtful due to these circumstances: (1) Lugeorge only mentioned the alleged order of Judge Pardo to deliver the cans of paint to his house when Tuldague confronted him about the missing cans of paint;
[33]
 (2) Tuldague thereafter ordered that âNOTE: TWO (2) BIG CAN (sic) OF COAT MASTER TAKEN OUT BY L. N. DISCIPULOâ
[34]
 be entered in the security logbook, but did not mention Judge Pardo in the entry; (3) Tuldague prepared Lugeorgeâs affidavit on 6 June 2006, or four years from the alleged order of Judge Pardo to Lugeorge in 2002; and (4) during his cross- examination, Tuldague admitted that Lugeorge had been his subordinate since he was appointed as Clerk of Court.
[35]
A material inconsistency is likewise present in Lugeorgeâs testimony when in his Affidavit, he stated that Judge Pardo ordered him to bring out two cans of paint from the RTC on 29 June 2002.
[36]
 On his cross- examination, however, Lugeorge testified that Judge Pardoâs order happened âbefore 29 June 2002.â
[37]
 In 
Jabon v. Judge Usman
,
[38]
 we held that the complainantâs glaring discrepancy in the date of the commission of the alleged corrupt act and his failure to correct the discrepancy despite given a chance, negatively affected his credibility.
With the failure of complainants to substantiate their charges, the complaint against Judge Pardo should be dismissed for lack of merit. However, we find Judge Pardo liable for gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
Rosendo testified that he went to Judge Pardoâs house to give him P6,000.00. Although the alleged giving of money was not proved, Judge Pardo did not deny that Rosendo, a litigant who had a pending application for probation in his 
sala
, went to his house, had a âdrinking spreeâ with him and stayed there for more than two hours.
Section 1, Canon 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary states that 
âJudges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer.â
 Section 2, Canon 2 of the Code states that 
âThe behavior and conduct of judges must reaffirm the peopleâs faith in the integrity of the judiciary.â
 Section 1, Canon 4 of the Code states that 
âJudges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.â
In 
Tan v. Rosete
,
[39]
 we ruled that the respondent judgeâs acts of meeting with litigants outside the office premises beyond office hours and sending a member of his staff to talk with complainant constitute gross misconduct. In 
J. King & Sons Company v. Hontanosas
,
[40]
 we likewise held respondent judge liable for misconduct when he entertained a litigant in his home and received benefits given by the litigant.
Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court classifies gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct as a serious offense. It is punishable by: (1) dismissal from the service, forfeiture of benefits, and disqualification from reinstatement to any public office; (2) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three months but not exceeding six months; or (3) a fine of more than P20,000 but not exceeding P40,000.
[41]
The Court notes that this is not the first offense of Judge Pardo. In 
Magpali v. Judge Pardo
,
[42]
 the Court fined him P10,000.00 for gross ignorance of the law and warned him that a repetition of similar acts would be dealt with more severely. In A.M. OCA IPI No. 05-2316-RTJ, we dismissed the charges of grave misconduct, gross ignorance of the law and violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct against Judge Pardo but reminded him to be more circumspect in the performance of his administrative functions, with a warning as well.
[43]
 In light of these circumstances, we find it proper to impose upon him the maximum fine of P40,000.00.
In 
A.M. OCA IPI No. 05-2243-P
, the complainants presented three witnesses to testify on separate instances when Calpatura allegedly committed corruption in cahoots with Judge Pardo.
First, Gorospe testified that Calpatura was introduced to him by CabaÃ±ero to help him with the lost records of his case. Calpatura allegedly urged Gorospe to buy liquor and 
pulutan
, and then they drank in the public market. Gorospe likewise accused Calpatura of asking goats for Judge Pardoâs birthday and for him. However, we find Gorospeâs accusations insufficient due to the following: (1) Calpatura presented CabaÃ±ero, who refuted Gorospeâs allegations and categorically stated that he never introduced Calpatura to Gorospe and neither did Calpatura join them to drink in the public market; (2) on cross-examination, Gorospe admitted that Judge Pardo never celebrated his birthday during his stint as a judge;
[44]
 and (3) Gorospeâs testimony likewise suffered from inconsistencies, such that, in his Affidavit,
[45]
 he stated that Judge Pardo instructed him to give him a goat through Calpatura, but on cross-examination he testified that it was Calpatura who asked him for a goat to be given to Judge Pardo.
[46]
Second, Juanito stated in his 
Salaysay
[47]
 that Calpatura asked for two goats from him while he was in jail. However, Juanitoâs statement fails to convince us. Juanito did not specify the circumstances as to when exactly Calpatura asked for the goats and how he was able to send the goats while he was in prison. On the other hand, Calpatura presented the Certification of the Provincial Warden to prove that he never visited the jail for any purpose. Juanito further admitted during his cross-examination that: (1) he is only familiar with a little Tagalog while his 
Salaysay
 was written in Tagalog and prepared by Tuldague; (2) when he was asked to identify his 
Salaysay
, he could only âsee a little,â or could see his signature only, because his vision was blurred; (3) he has little education and he could only recall what he stated in his 
Salaysay
 if it would be read to him; and (4) finally, he signed his 
Salaysay
 in Tuldagueâs house since they were neighbors.
[48]
Third, Tuldague alleged that Diaz complained to him about giving P10,000.00 or part of her cash bond to Betguen and Calpatura after being assured that it would settle her case.
[49]
 Again, we cannot accept Tuldagueâs allegation, even though corroborated by Fernando. Both Tuldague and Fernando lacked direct and personal knowledge of whether Diaz indeed gave her cash bond to Betguen and Calpatura. Diaz, on the other hand, consistently and categorically testified that it was Betguen only who received her released cash bond amounting to P16,000.00.
[50]
While the law does not tolerate misconduct by a civil servant, suspension, replacement or dismissal must not be resorted to unless there is substantial evidence to merit such penalties.
[51]
 In the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, Calpatura cannot be held accountable for the charges against him.
As for 
A.M. No. 05-10-661-RTC
, we adopt the finding of the OCA that the same should be considered closed and terminated, insofar as Judge Pardo is concerned. In any case, Judge Pardo has already complied with this Courtâs Resolution. In 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Mantua
,
[52]
 where respondent judge was charged with gross inefficiency for undue delay in deciding cases, we considered the said judge's earnest efforts in attending to the pending cases in his docket sufficient to negate his liability.
WHEREFORE
, we find respondent Judge Moises Pardo, retired Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Cabarroguis, Quirino, Branch 31, 
GUILTY
 of gross misconduct and 
FINE
 him P40,000.00 to be deducted from his retirement benefits. The Office of the Court Administrator is 
DIRECTED
 to release the retirement pay and other benefits due Judge Pardo unless he is charged in some other administrative complaint or the same is otherwise withheld for some other lawful cause.
We 
DISMISS
 the complaint against Jaime Calpatura, Legal Researcher and Officer-In-Charge, Branch Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Cabarroguis, Quirino, Branch 32, for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
