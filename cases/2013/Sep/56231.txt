[ G.R. No. 200080, September 18, 2013 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARVIN CAYANAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
RESOLUTION




REYES, J.:


Accused-appellant Marvin Cayanan (Cayanan) seeks a review of the Decision
[1]
 dated July 14, 2011 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR- HC No. 04256 affirming with modifications the Consolidated Decision
[2]
 dated June 16, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos City, Bulacan, Branch 77. The RTC decision convicted Cayanan of the crimes of Qualified Rape (Criminal Case No. 1499-M-2001) and Forcible Abduction with Qualified Rape (Criminal Case No. 1498-M-2001), and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 for each crime without eligibility for parole.
The CA, however, increased the award of damages originally awarded by the RTC: (1) in Criminal Case No. 1499-M-2001, from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; and (2) in Criminal Case No. 1498-M-2001, from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00 as moral damages. The CA also awarded an additional P75,000.00 as moral damages in Criminal Case No. 1499-M-2001 and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages in both criminal cases.
[3]
The prosecution established that Cayanan took advantage of 15-year old AAA
[4]
 on February 1, 2001 while the victim was alone inside her house in x x x, Bulacan. Cayanan is the victimâs brother-in-law, being married to her older sister, and the couple lived in a nearby house. AAA was asleep when she felt someone caressing her. It turned out to be Cayanan. He then started kissing her and told her to remove her shorts. When she refused, Cayanan forcibly took it off and after the latter took off his own undergarment, he inserted his organ into her genitalia. Cayanan, who had a knife with him, threatened to kill AAA if she resisted and informed anybody of the incident.
On February 26, 2001, AAA was about to enter the school campus with her friend Armina Adriano (Adriano) when Cayanan arrived on a tricycle driven by his uncle, Boy Manalastas. Cayanan then pulled AAA towards the tricycle. She tried shouting but he covered her mouth. They alighted somewhere and boarded a jeep. He brought her to a dress shop in x x x, Bulacan where he asked someone to give her a change of clothes as she was in her school uniform and later to a Jollibee outlet. He then brought her to his sisterâs house in x x x where he raped her inside a bedroom. Afterwards, a certain couple Putay and Tessie talked to Cayanan and she was brought to the 
barangay
 office where she was asked to execute a document stating that she voluntarily went with Cayanan. It was the latterâs mother and sister-in-law who brought her home later that evening. She told her mother and brother of the incidents only after her classmate Adriano informed her family of what happened in school and of the rape incidents. AAA testified that she did not immediately tell her family because she was still in a state of shock.
[5]
Adriano and the victimâs mother corroborated her testimony. A resident psychiatrist at the National Center for Mental Health also testified that AAA was suffering from mental depressive symptoms/chronic symptoms and presence of sexual abuse.
[6]
Cayanan interposed the sweetheart defense. The RTC, however, did not give credit to his defense, ruling that it is a weak defense and does not rule out the use of force given the prosecutionâs evidence. He also failed to establish the genuineness and authenticity of the love letters allegedly written by AAA.
[7]
The CA sustained the ruling of the RTC.
[8]
A review of the CA decision shows that it did not commit any reversible error in affirming Cayananâs conviction. Record shows that Cayanan forced AAA to have sex with him on February 1, 2001 and threatened her and her family with physical harm. The testimony of Adriano, meanwhile, corroborated AAAâs testimony that Cayanan forcibly took her by the school campus gate on February 26, 2001 and thereafter raped her. The defense failed to show any reason why the prosecutionâs evidence should not be given weight or credit.
Moreover, the claim that they were sweethearts does not justify the commission of the crimes. For the Court to even consider giving credence to the sweetheart defense, it must be proven by compelling evidence. The defense cannot just present testimonial evidence in support of the theory. Independent proof is required - such as tokens, mementos, and photographs.
[9]
 And while Cayanan produced two love letters allegedly written by AAA, the CA correctly sustained the finding of the RTC that these letters were unauthenticated and therefore, bereft of any probative value.
The Court, however, finds that Cayanan should be convicted only of Qualified Rape in Criminal Case No. 1498-M-2001. Forcible abduction is absorbed in the crime of rape if the real objective of the accused is to rape the victim.
[10]
 In this case, circumstances show that the victimâs abduction was with the purpose of raping her. Thus, after Cayanan dragged her into the tricycle, he took her to several places until they reached his sisterâs house where he raped her inside the bedroom. Under these circumstances, the rape absorbed the forcible abduction.
[11]
Finally, the CA did not commit any reversible error in increasing the amount of civil indemnity and moral damages awarded in Criminal Case No. 1498-M-2001, and in awarding additional P75,000.00 as moral damages in Criminal Case No. 1499-M-2001 and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages in both criminal cases, as these are in accord with prevailing jurisprudence.
[12]
