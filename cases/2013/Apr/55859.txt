PEREZ, J.:


For decision are the following petitions for review on certiorari:
[1]
1. 
G.R. No. 141809
, which assails the Resolutions
[2]
 dated 28 December 1999 and 28 January 2000 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 56292;
2. 
G.R. No. 147186
, which assails the Resolutions
[3]
 dated 29 November 2000 and 16 February 2001 of the Court of Appeals in CAÂ­ G.R. SP No. 58790; and
3. 
G.R. No. 173641
, which assails the Decision
[4]
 dated 31 March 2006 and Resolution
[5]
 dated 19 July 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 84738.
These petitions share the same facts:
The Land, Loan and Mortgage
Jose D. Ingles, Sr. (Jose) and his wife, petitioner Josefina F. Ingles (Josefina), were the registered owners of a 2,265 square meter parcel of land in Quezon City per Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 125341 PR-17485.6 TCT No. 125341 PR-17485 contains the following 
technical description
 of the land of Jose and Josefina:
[7]
A parcel of land (lot 13, block W-35 of the subd. [p]lan Psd-7365-D, being a portion of Lot R.P. 3-D-2-B of Plan BSD-7365-D, G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 7681) situated in the District of Diliman, Quezon City. Bounded on the NW., along line 1-2 by lot 14, block W-35[;] on the NE., along line 2-3-4-5-6, by R-285; on the SE., along line 6-7-8-9, by R-283; on the SW., along line 9-10 by lot 13, block Q-35; and on the NW., along line 10-1 by lot 15 block W-35; all of the subd. [p]lan x x x x beginning, containing an area of TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE (2,265) SQUARE METERS, more or less.
On 14 April 1993, Jose and Josefina obtained a loan in the amount of P6,200,000.00 from respondent Charles J. Esteban (Charles). As collateral for such loan, Jose and Josefina mortgaged their above-described land in favor of Charles. A 
Promissory Note
[8]
 and a 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
,
[9]
 evidencing both such loan and mortgage, were accordingly executed between Jose, Josefina and Charles on the same day.
The 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
, the mortgaged land was mistakenly referred to as being covered by TCT No. 125141 PR-17485 instead of TCT No. 125
3
41 PR-17485.
[10]
 Nevertheless, the deed identified the mortgaged land exactly in accordance with the technical description of TCT No. 125341 PR-17485.
[11]
 The pertinent part of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage thus read:
[12]
For and in consideration of a loan in the amount of SIX MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P6,200,000.00), Philippine Currency, in hand given by the MORTGAGEE [Charles] to the MORTGAGOR/S [Jose and Josefina], the receipt, of the said amount is hereby acknowledged and confessed x x x, the MORTGAGOR/S [Jose and Josefina] hereby cede, transfer and convey, BY WAY OF FIRST MORTGAGE, unto and favor of the MORTGAGEE [Charles], his heirs, successors and assigns, a parcel of land located at ____________, together with the residential house constructed on the said land, which is more particularly described in 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 125
1
41 PR-17485
, Registry of Deeds of ______________ as follows:
A parcel of land (lot 13, block W-35 of the subd. plan Psd-7365-D, being a portion of Lot R.P. 3-D-2-B of Plan Bsd-7365-D, G.L.R.O. Rec. [N]o. 7681) situated in District of Diliman, Quezon City. Bounded on the NW., along line 1-2 by lot 14, block W-35; on the NE., along line 2-3-4-5-6, by R-285; on the SE., along line 6-7-8-9, by R-283; on the SW., along line 9-10 by lot 13, block W-35; and on the NW., along line 10-1 by lot 15, block W-35; all of the subd. plan x x x x beginning, containing an area of TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE (2,265) SQUARE METERS, more or less. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).
Moreover, the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 contained the following stipulation: â
upon the failure of the MORTGAGOR/S
 [Jose and Josefina]
 to pay
 [their loan] 
at maturity date
 x x x 
the MORTGAGOR/S
 [Jose and Josefina] 
may elect or choose to foreclose [the] mortgage judicially or extrajudicially 
x x x.â
[13]
 The deed provided further that: â
in the event of extrajudicial foreclosure of [the] mortgage
 x x x 
the MORTGAGOR/S
 [Jose and Josefina] 
name, constitute and appoint the MORTGAGEE
 [Charles] 
as attorney-in-fact without further formality, with full power and authority to dispose the mortgaged property in accordance with the provision of Act 3135 as amended.â
[14]
On 26 April 1993, Jose and Josefina requested the Register of Deeds of Quezon City for the division of their land into ten (10) lots.
[15]
  The request eventually led to the cancellation of TCT No. 125341 PR-17485 and the issuance of separate 
Torrens
 titles for each of the 10 lots, namely, TCT Nos. 85825-34.
[16]
Upon maturity of their loan on 29 May 1993, Jose and Josefina issued to Charles a check for P6,200,000.00 as payment. Unfortunately, that check bounced.
[17]
On 30 October 1993, Jose died.
[18]
 He was survived by Josefina and herein petitioners Jose F. Ingles, Jr., Hector Ingles, Josefina I. Estrada and Teresita Biron (collectively, the Ingleses).
On 13 July 1994, Charles sent to Josefina a letter demanding for the payment of her and her late husbandâs loan. Charles, in the same letter, also threatened to foreclose the mortgage in his favor should Josefina fail to heed the demand for payment within ten (10) days from her receipt of the letter.
[19]
 To these, Josefina responded with her own letter asking Charles for an extension of time, 
i.e
., until 30 October 1994, within which to pay for all of her obligations.
[20]
  Despite the extension, however, Josefina still failed to pay.
[21]
The Extrajudicial Foreclosure
On 12 July 1997, Charles petitioned
[22]
 Executive Judge Estrella T. Estrada (Executive Judge Estrada) of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City for the 
extrajudicial
 foreclosure of the mortgage in his favor.  Invoking the provisions of Act No. 3135
[23]
 and the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
, Charles sought for the sale at public auction of the ten (10) lots originally subsumed in TCT No.  125
3
41 PR-17485 but which are now separately covered by TCT Nos. 85825-34 in the names of Josefina and her late husband.
On 8 October 1997, Executive Judge Estrada issued an 
Order
[24]
 directing Atty. Mercedes Gatmaytan (Atty. Gatmaytan), the Clerk of Court and Ex-
Officio Sheriff
 of the Quezon City RTC, to proceed with the extrajudicial sale of the ten (10) lots covered by TCT Nos. 85825-34.25 Against such Order, the Ingleses filed a motion for reconsideration on 13 October 1997. On 20 November 2007, however, Executive Judge Estrada issued an Order26 denying such motion for reconsideration.
On 1 December 1997, Atty. Gatmaytan issued a Notice of Sale
[27]
 setting the public auction on 6 January 1998.
At the public auction, Charles was declared the highest bidder for all of the ten (10) lots. On 7 January 1998, Atty. Gatmaytan issued to Charles a corresponding Certificate of Sale.
[28]
The Legal Challenges of the Ingleses and the
 Petition for the Issuance of Writ of Possession of Charles
On 23 January 1998, the Ingleses filed with the Quezon City RTC a complaint for the 
Annulment of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
[29]
 against Charles. In this complaint, the Ingleses claim that Jose and Josefina never actually consented to any mortgage on their land and that their signatures in the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 were obtained thru Charlesâ deception.
[30]
 The Ingleses allege that Charles had deceived Jose and Josefina into signing blank documents, one of which eventually becoming the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 and another becoming the 
Promissory Note
, on the pretense that such documents were required in a business venture that they had.
[31]
 This complaint was docketed as 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
[32]
 and was raffled to Branch 225.
On 24 July 1998, Charles registered his Certificate of Sale with the Register of Deeds of Quezon City.
[33]
On 15 September 1998, Charles filed an 
Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession
[34]
 before the Quezon City RTC,35 wherein he asked to immediately be placed in possession of the ten (10) lots foreclosed in his favor 
in lieu
 of their current possessors, the Ingleses.
[36]
 This petition was docketed as 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and was raffled to Branch 92.
On 23 February 1999, Branch 92 of the Quezon City RTC issued an 
Order
[37]
 directing 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 to be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
[38]
 under Branch 225. As a consequence of the consolidation, the records of LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) were transferred to Branch 225.
On 17 December 1999, on the other hand, the Ingleses filed before the Court of Appeals a petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
[39]
 pursuant to Rule 47 of the Rules of Court. In it, the Ingleses sought the nullification of the 
Orders
 dated 8 October 1997, 20 November 1997 and 27 July 1998
[40]
 of Executive Judge Estrada, which allowed Charles to extrajudicially foreclose the mortgage on the ten (10) lots as well as to register the resulting Certificate of Sale. The Ingleses argue that Executive Judge Estrada was bereft of any jurisdiction to issue the assailed 
Orders
 in light of the provisions in the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
: (a) referring to the mortgaged property as being covered by TCT No. 125
1
41 PR-17485 rather than TCT No. 125
3
41 PR-17485, and (b) giving to Jose and Josefina, not to Charles, the right to choose whether the mortgage may be extrajudicially foreclosed or not.
[41]
 In issuing the assailed 
Orders
, therefore, the Ingleses accuse Executive Judge Estrada of â
amending
,â â
altering
,â and â
revising
â the terms of the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 that could not be done in a mere extrajudicial proceeding.
[42]
  This petition was docketed as 
CA-G.R. SP No. 56292
.
CA-G.R. SP No. 56292: Annulment of Final Orders
On 28 December 1999, the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP. No. 56292
 issued a 
Resolution
[43]
 dismissing the petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
 on grounds of non-compliance with Section 4, Rule 47
[44]
 and Section 3, Rule 4645 of the Rules of Court. The Ingleses filed a motion for reconsideration.
On 28 January 2000, the Court of Appeals issued a 
Resolution
[46]
 denying the motion for reconsideration. In this later 
Resolution
, however, the Court of Appeals used a different, albeit a more fundamental 
rationale
 to maintain its dismissal of the petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
.
In the later Resolution, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. According to the Court of Appeals, it cannot take original cognizance of the Inglesesâ petition as the same does not qualify either as an action under Rule 47 or, for that matter, as any other case that would fall within its original jurisdiction under Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.
[47]
 The Court of Appeals pointed out that the petition for Annulment of Final Orders assails orders issued by an executive judge in a proceeding merely for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage whereas the Rules of Court
[48]
 clearly prescribes that only judgments, final orders and resolutions issued by a â
Regional Trial Court
â in â
civil actionsâ
 may be the subject of annulment under Rule 47.
[49]
 The Court of Appeals further added that, at any rate, the principle of hierarchy of courts dictates that the Ingleses should have first challenged the validity of the 
Orders
 of Executive Judge Estrada in an appropriate case before the RTC instead of resorting to a direct action before it.
[50]
 
Unconvinced, the Ingleses appealed
[51]
 both
 Resolutions
 of the Court of Appeals before this Court in what would be the first of the three petitions consolidated herein. This appeal by 
certiorari
 is currently 
G.R. No. 141809
.
The Proceedings in Quezon City RTC, Branch 225
Meanwhile, as 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 had already been consolidated with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
, Charles filed a 
Motion for Issuance of [a] Writ of Possession
[52]
 before Branch 225 of the Quezon City RTC on 9 September 1999. Branch 225 was then presided by Judge Arsenio J. Magpale (Judge Magpale).
In his 
Motion for Issuance of [a] Writ of Possession
, Charles reiterated his plea to be put in possession of the ten (10) lots.
[53]
 But in order to show all the more his entitlement to a writ of possession, Charles also raised therein the fact that he now had consolidated title over the ten (10) lots as a consequence of the failure of the Ingleses to exercise their right of redemption within the period allowed by law.
[54]
On 19 November 1999, the RTC denied for lack of merit Charlesâ 
Motion for Issuance of [a] Writ of Possession
. Four days after, Charles filed a motion for reconsideration.
On 7 February 2000, the RTC issued a resolution55 on granting Charlesâ motion for reconsideration. The dispositive portion of the resolution allowed Charles to present 
ex parte 
evidence in support of his application for a writ of possession before the Branch Clerk of Court, viz:
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, petitioner Charles J. Estebanâs Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED. For this purpose, the petitioner is hereby directed to present evidence ex- parte before Atty. Arlene V. Mancao, Branch Clerk of Court, the appointed commissioner within five (5) days from receipt of this order and for the said commissioner to submit to the Court her report as soon as the presentation of ex-parte evidence is through.
[56]
On 29 February 2000, the Ingleses filed a motion for reconsideration against the 7 February 2000 resolution of the RTC.
On 1 March 2000, the Branch Clerk of Court received, in an 
ex- parte
 hearing, the testimony of Charles in support of his application for a writ of possession.
[57]
 After which, Charles submitted a 
Formal Offer of Evidence
[58]
 for his documentary exhibits.
On 10 May 2000, the RTC denied the Inglesesâ motion for reconsideration.
Aggrieved, the Ingleses filed a 
certiorari
 petition
[59]
 before the Court of Appeals contesting the 7 February 2000 resolution and 10 May 2000 order of the RTC. In the said petition, the Ingleses argue that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in allowing Charles to present 
ex-parte
 evidence on his application for a writ of possession despite the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
.
[60]
 The Ingleses posit that the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 effectively tied the resolution of Charlesâ application for a writ of possession with the resolution of their action for annulment of mortgage.
[61]
 For the Ingleses then, the RTC cannot simply allow Charles to present 
ex-parte
 evidence on his application for a writ possession without first laying to rest, in a judicial proceeding for that purpose, other related issues raised in 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
.
[62]
  This 
certiorari
 petition, which was accompanied by a prayer for a temporary restraining order, was docketed before the Court of Appeals as 
CA-G.R. SP No. 58790
.
On account of the pendency of CA-G.R. SP No. 58790, the RTC issued another resolution
[63]
 on 10 July 2000 holding in abeyance any action and resolution on Charlesâ 
Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession.
Subsequently, however, Judge Magpale inhibited himself from further hearing 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
.
[64]
 The two (2) consolidated cases were thus re-raffled and were eventually assigned to Branch 97 of the Quezon City RTC, which was then presided by Judge Oscar L. Leviste (Judge Leviste).
[65]
CA-G.R. SP No. 58790: Certiorari Petition
In CA-G.R. SP No. 58790, on the other hand, the Court of Appeals issued a 
Resolution
[66]
 on 29 November 2000 dismissing outright the 
certiorari
 petition of the Ingleses on the ground of non- compliance with Section 1 of Rule 65
[67]
 in relation to Section 3 of Rule 46
[68]
 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeals condemned the 
certiorari 
petition as its verification and certificate against forum shopping
[69]
 was signed by only two (2) out of its five (5) named petitioners. As it turns out, only Josefina and Hector F. Ingles signed the verification and certificate of non-forum shopping, while Jose F. Ingles, Jr., Josefina I. Estrada and Teresita Biron did not.
[70]
On 11 December 2000, the Ingleses filed before the Court of Appeals a motion for reconsideration. On 16 February 2001, the Court of Appeals issued a 
Resolution
[71]
 denying the Inglesesâ motion for reconsideration.
The denial of their motion for reconsideration prompted the Ingleses to lodge an appeal
[72]
 before this Court that, in turn, became the second of three petitions consolidated herein. This appeal by 
certiorari
 is currently 
G.R. No. 147186.
The Proceedings in Quezon City RTC, Branch 97 and 98
Back in Branch 97 of the Quezon City RTC, proceedings in
 LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) and Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 continued. On 2 April 2001, the RTC issued an Order
[73]
 requiring Charles to submit a memorandum in support of his application for a writ of possession. The same order also required the Ingleses to file a comment on Charlesâ memorandum.
On 12 July 2001, after evaluating Charlesâ memorandum and the Inglesesâ comment thereon, the RTC issued an Order
[74]
 granting the 
Ex Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession
. The order directed the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of Charles.
[75]
On 19 July 2001, the Ingleses filed a Motion For Reconsideration
[76]
 from the above order. The Ingleses also submitted a Supplemental 
Motion For Reconsideration
[77]
 on 23 July 2001.
On 24 July 2001, the RTC issued an Order
[78]
 directing Charles: (1) to submit an opposition to the Inglesesâ 
Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration
 within ten (10) days from receipt of the order, and (2) should the Ingleses find it necessary to file a reply in response to his opposition, to submit a rejoinder within ten (10) days from his receipt of such reply.
[79]
On 24 July 2001, Charles filed his Opposition
[80]
 to the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration
. On 2 August 2001, the Ingleses filed their Reply
[81]
 to Charlesâ opposition.
On 26 September 2001, the Ingleses also filed a Motion To Dismiss
[82]
 asking for the dismissal of the 
Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession
. For his part, Charles filed an Opposition
[83]
 to the 
Motion To Dismiss.
Unfortunately, at about that time, Judge Leviste retired without being able to resolve the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration, Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration and Motion To Dismiss
.
[84]
  The retirement of Judge Leviste eventually
[85]
 led to a re-raffle of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 on 16 January 2003 that transferred the two (2) consolidated cases to Branch 98âpresided by Judge Evelyn Corpuz-Cabochan (Judge Corpuz- Cabochan).
[86]
On 23 June 2004, or more than a year after 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 were raffled to Branch 98, Charles filed a 
mandamus
 petition
[87]
 before the Court of Appeals. In it, Charles asked the Court of Appeals to compel Judge Corpuz- Cabochan to rule on the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration, Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration and Motion To Dismiss
 that have remained unresolved well beyond the period prescribed for its resolution under Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 01-28.
[88]
 This petition was docketed before the Court of Appeals as 
CA-G.R. SP No. 84738.
During the pendecy of CA-G.R. SP No. 84738, the RTC (thru an 18 June 2004 Order
[89]
 signed by Judge Corpuz-Cabochan) suspended the proceedings in
 LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) 
and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
.  As 
rationale 
for the suspension, the RTC cited the pendency of 
G.R. Nos. 141809
 and 
147186
 before this Court, to wit:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is hereby ordered that the proceedings in these consolidated cases are suspended until after the Honorable Supreme Court shall have resolved the pending petitions before it, docketed as G.R. No. (sic) 141809 and 147186.
[90]
As a response to the issuance of the above order, Charles filed a supplemental petition
[91]
 to his 
mandamus
 petition.
CA-G.R. SP No. 84738: Mandamus Petition
On 31 March 2006, the Court of Appeals rendered a 
Decision
[92]
 granting Charlesâ 
mandamus
 petition. The Court of Appeals thus disposed:
WHEREFORE, above premises all considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED. Public respondent Judge [Judge Corpuz- Cabochan] is hereby DIRECTED to resolve with dispatch the pending incidents in LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98), i.e. 
Motion for Reconsideration
 dated July 19, 2001, 
Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration 
dated July 23, 2001 and 
Motion to Dismiss
, dated September 21, 2001.
[93]
In its 
Decision
, the Court of Appeals found that the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration, Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration
 and 
Motion To Dismiss
 were already due to be resolved pursuant to Section 15, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution
[94]
 and Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 01-28,
[95]
 which mandates trial courts to decide or resolve all cases or matters pending before them within three (3) months from the time they were submitted for decision or resolution.
[96]
Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that no justifiable reason exists why the Inglesesâ Motion For Reconsideration, Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration and Motion To Dismiss should remain unresolved.
[97]
 The Court of Appeals was not convinced that either the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 or the pendency of 
G.R. Nos. 141809
 and 
147186 
may be used as a valid excuse to delay resolution of the subject motions.
[98]
The Ingleses filed a motion for reconsideration, but the Court Appeals remained steadfast in its 
Resolution
[99]
 dated 19 July 2006.
Feeling slighted, the Ingleses filed an appeal
[100]
 before this Courtâthe third of three petitions consolidated herein. This appeal by 
certiorari
 is currently 
G.R. No. 173641
.
OUR RULING
We deny all three petitions.
G.R. No. 141809
The sole issue presented in 
G.R. No. 141809
 was whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Inglesesâ petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders.
[101]
The Ingleses would have us answer in the affirmative; adamant that their petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
 is an action validly instituted under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court.
[102]
 They argue that the Court of Appeals could have still taken cognizance of their petition even though the orders assailed therein were issued merely by an executive judge in an extrajudicial foreclosure proceeding.
[103]
 The Ingleses posit that the assailed 
Orders
 dated 8 October 1997, 20 November 1997 and 27 July 1998 of Executive Judge Estrada may, in view of their peculiar nature, be treated as final orders issued in a â
civil action
â by a â
Regional Trial Courtâ
 itself.
[104]
On that note, the Ingleses claim that the assailed 
Orders 
of Executive Judge Estrada are not the usual orders issued in proceedings for extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages.
[105]
 According to the Ingleses, Executive Judge Estrada had to practically assume and exercise powers otherwise reserved only to an RTC judge presiding over a civil action when she issued the assailed 
Orders
.
[106]
  As the Ingleses further explain:
1. The assailed 
Orders
 allowed the extrajudicial foreclosure on their ten (10) lots despite the express provision in the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 referring to the mortgaged property as being covered by TCT No. 125
1
41 PR-17485 and not by TCT No. 125
3
41 PR-17485 
i.e
., the mother title of the ten (10) lots.
[107]
 In issuing the assailed 
Orders
, therefore, Executive Judge Estrada acted as if she was a judge in an action for 
Reformation of Contract
 by interpreting that what the
 Deed of Real Estate Mortgage 
really meant was that the mortgaged property was covered by TCT No. 125
3
41 PR-17485.
[108]
2. The assailed 
Orders
 also allowed the extrajudicial foreclosure on their ten (10) lots even though Jose and Josefina never exercised their prerogative under the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 to have the mortgage on their property extrajudicially foreclosed.
[109]
 In issuing the assailed 
Orders
, therefore, Executive Judge Estrada acted as if she was a judge in some justiciable case by essentially setting aside the above prerogative of Jose and Josefina under the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
.
[110]
Hence, the Ingleses conclude, the assailed 
Orders
 of Executive Judge Estrada are basically as good as a final orders issued in a 
âcivil action
â by a â
Regional Trial Court
.â
[111]
We disagree.
The Exclusive Original Jurisdiction 
of the Court of Appeals and Rule 47 
Section 9(2) of 
Batas Pambansa Blg.
 129 or the 
Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980,
 vests the Court of Appeals with exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for 
âannulment of judgments of Regional Trial Courts.
â The remedy by which such jurisdiction may be invoked is provided under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court.
Conformably, Rule 47 sanctions the filing of a petition for the 
Annulment of Judgments, Final Orders and Resolutions 
before the Court of Appeals. Section 1 of Rule 47, however, defines the scope and nature of this petition:
RULE 47
ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENTS OR FINAL
ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS
SECTION 1. 
Coverage
.âThis Rule shall govern the annulment by the Court of Appeals of judgments or final orders and resolutions in 
civil actions
 of 
Regional Trial Courts
 for which the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner. (Emphasis supplied)
The above-quoted section sets forth in no unclear terms that only judgments, final orders and resolutions in â
civil actions
â of â
Regional Trial Courts
â may be the subject of a petition for annulment before the Court of Appeals. Against this premise, it becomes apparent why the Inglesesâ petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders 
must fail. We substantiate:
Proceedings for the Extrajudicial Foreclosure 
of Mortgages are not Civil Actions
The subject of the Inglesesâ petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
 are not the proper subjects of a petition for annulment before the Court of Appeals. The assailed Orders dated 8 October 1997, 20 November 1997 and 27 July 1998 of Executive Judge Estrada are not the final orders in â
civil actions
â of â
Regional Trial Courts
â that may be the subject of annulment by the Court of Appeals under Rule 47.  There is a clear-cut difference between issuances made in a â
civil action
â on one hand and orders rendered in a proceeding for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage on the other.
âCivil actionsâ
 are suits filed in court involving either the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong.
[112]
 They are commenced by the filing of an original complaint before an appropriate court
[113]
 and their proceedings are governed by the provisions of the Rules on Court on ordinary or special civil actions.
[114]
 Civil actions are adversarial in nature; presupposing the existence of disputes defined by the parties that are, in turn, submitted before the court for disposition. Issuances made therein, including and most especially judgments, final orders or resolutions, are therefore rendered by courts in the exercise of their judicial function.
In contrast, proceedings for the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages, as the name already suggests, are not suits filed in a court.
[115]
 They are commenced not by the filing of a complaint, but by submitting an application before an executive judge
[116]
 who, in turn, receives the same neither in a judicial capacity nor on behalf of the court.
[117]
 The conduct of such proceedings is not governed by the rules on ordinary or special civil actions, but by Act No. 3135, as amended, and by special administrative orders issued by this Court.
[118]
Proceedings for the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages are also not adversarial; as the executive judge merely performs therein an administrative function to ensure that all requirements for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage are satisfied before the clerk of court, as the 
ex-officio 
sheriff,
[119]
 goes ahead with the public auction of the mortgaged property.
[120]
 Necessarily, the orders of the executive judge in such proceedings, whether they be to allow or disallow the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage, are not issued in the exercise of a judicial function but, in the words of 
First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. v. Gatmaytan
:
x x x issued by the RTC Executive Judge in the exercise of his 
administrative function to supervise the ministerial duty of the Clerk of Court as Ex Officio Sheriff in the conduct of an extrajudicial foreclsoure sale
 x x x.
[121]
(Emphasis supplied)
Verily, the 
Orders
 dated 8 October 1997, 20 November 1997 and 27 July 1998 of Executive Judge Estrada cannot be the subject of a petition for annulment before the Court of Appeals. Such orders, issued as they were by an executive judge in connection with a proceeding for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage, evidently do not fall within the type of issuances so carefully identified under Section 1 of Rule 47. The Court of Appeals was, therefore, correct in postulating that the annulment of the assailed 
Orders
 is not within their exclusive original jurisdiction per Section 9(2) of 
Batas Pambansa Blg
. 129.
Allegation that the Assailed Orders
were Rendered Without Jurisdiction is 
Immaterial, Baseless
The allegation of the Ingleses that Executive Judge Estrada overstepped her jurisdiction in issuing the assailed 
Orders
 is immaterial to the issue of whether the Court of Appeals may assume jurisdiction over their petition. Assuming 
arguendo 
that Executive Judge Estrada did exceed her jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Orders, the nature of such orders and the circumstances under which they were issued would still remain the same. The mere fact, nay, the mere allegation, that the assailed 
Orders
 have been issued without jurisdiction do not make them, even by the limits of either the strongest reasoning or the most colourful imagination, final orders in a â
civil action
â by a â
Regional Trial Court.
â Clearly, a petition under Rule 47 even then would still not be a viable remedy.
At any rate, this Court finds that Executive Judge Estrada did not actually âexceedâ her jurisdiction when she issued the assailed 
Orders
. All that Executive Judge Estrada did was to render an interpretation of the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 on its faceâwhich is something that she is lawfully entitled, if not obliged, to do in an extrajudicial foreclosure proceeding. After all, an executive judge has the administrative duty in such proceedings to ensure that all the conditions of the law have been complied with before authorizing the public auction of any mortgaged property
[122]
 and this duty, by 
necessity
, includes facially examining the mortgage agreement as to whether it adequately identified the land to be auctioned or whether it contains sufficient authorization on the part of the mortgagee to push forth with an extrajudicial sale.  Of course, an executive judge may 
err
 in the exercise of such administrative function and, as a result, may improvidently sanction an extrajudicial sale based on a faulty construction of a mortgage agreementâbut those are not errors of jurisdiction inasmuch as they relate only to the 
exercise
 of jurisdiction.
In fine, therefore, We see no reversible error on the part of the Court of Appeals in dismissing the Inglesesâ petition for 
Annulment of Final Orders
.
G.R. No. 147186
At the core of 
G.R. No. 147186
, on the other hand, is the solitary issue of whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition.
The Ingleses submit that the Court of Appeals erred. They contend that the failure of some of them to sign the subject verification and certification of non-forum shopping may be excused given the fact that all of them are members of only one family and, as such, share but a common interest in the cause of their petition.
[123]
The Ingleses point out that the two (2) of them who were actually able to sign the verification and certificate against forum shopping, 
i.e
., Josefina and Hector F. Ingles, are mother and brother, respectively, to the rest of them who were unable to sign.
[124]
 Hence, the Ingleses argue, the signatures of only two (2) of them in the verification and certification of non-forum shopping ought to be enough to be considered as substantial compliance with the requirements thereon per Section 1 of Rule 65 and Section 3 of Rule 46.
[125]
We find that the Court of Appeals did err in dismissing the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition on the ground of non-compliance with the requirements on verification and certification against forum shopping. The Court of Appeals ought to have given due course to the 
certiorari 
petition because there was, in this case, substantial compliance with the said requirements by the Ingleses.
However, instead of remanding the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition to the Court of Appeals, this Court opted to exercise its sound discretion to herein resolve the merits of the same. This was done for the sole purpose of finally putting an end to a pervading issue responsible for delaying the proceedings in 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
, 
i.e
., the effect of the consolidation of the two cases to Charlesâ entitlement to a writ of possession.
On that end, We find that the Inglesesâ 
certiorari 
petition to be without merit. Ultimately, We deny 
G.R. No. 147186
.
I
We begin with the Court of Appealsâ erroneous dismissal based on techicality.
The Requirements of Verification and Certification
 Against Forum Shopping and the Altres126 Ruling
A 
certiorari
 petition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is one where the pleadings required to be both verified and accompanied by a certification against forum shopping when filed before a court.
[127]
  While both verification and certification against forum shopping are concurring requirements in a 
certiorari
 petition, one requirement is distinct from the other in terms of nature and purpose.
In the seminal case of 
Altres v. Empleo
, this Court laid out guiding principles that synthesized the various jurisprudential pronouncements regarding non-compliance with the requirements on, or submission of a defective, verification and certification against forum shopping. We quote them at length:
1) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non- compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.
2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.
[128]
3) 
Verification is deemed 
substantially
 complied with when 
one
 who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.
[129]
4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of "substantial compliance" or presence of "special circumstances or compelling reasons.â
[130]
5) 
The certification against forum shopping must be signed by 
all
 the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case
;
[131]
 
otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. 
Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule
.
[132]
6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel.
[133]
 If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney [citation omitted] designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf.
[134]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Guided by the 
Altres
 precedent, We find that the dismissal by the RTC of the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition on the ground of a defective verification and certification against forum shopping to be incorrect. We substantiate:
The Ingleses Substantially Complied with
 the Requirement of Verification
 
The Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition was properly verified even though not all of them were able to sign the same. As related by 
Altres
, the requirement of verification is deemed substantially complied with if â
one
 who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.
â
The pronouncement in 
Altres
 is based on the recognition that the purpose of verifying a petition or complaint, 
i.e
., to assure the court that such petition or complaint was filed in good faith; and that the allegations therein are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of speculation,
[135]
 can sufficiently be achieved even if only one of the several petitioners or plaintiffs signs the verification.
[136]
 As long the signatory of the verification is competent, there is already substantial compliance with the requirement.
Verily, the signatures of 
all
 of the Ingleses were not required to validly verify their 
certiorari
 petition. It suffices, according to 
Altres
, that the verification was signed by at least one of the Ingleses who was competent to do so. In this case, the 
certiorari
 petition was verified by Josefina and Hector F. Inglesâboth of whom this Court finds competent to attest to the truth of the allegations of their petition, considering that they are unquestionably principal parties-in-interest to their 
certiorari
 petition.
[137]
 Hence, their 
certiorari
 petition contains a substantially valid verification.
The Ingleses Substantially Complied 
with the Requirement of Certification 
Against Forum Shopping
The Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition likewise contains a substantially complaint certificate against forum shopping. 
Altres
 articulates the rule where a certification against forum shopping is required to be attached in a petition or complaint that names several petitioners or plaintiffs, as follows:
5) 
The certification against forum shopping must be signed by 
all
 the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case;138 otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. 
Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule
.
[139]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).
The rule exposes the fault of the Court of Appeals:
First
. To begin with, the mere fact that only some and not all of the Ingleses signed the certification against forum shopping attached to their 
certiorari
 petitionâis not a valid ground for the outright dismissal of such petition as to 
all
 of the Ingleses.
[140]
 As 
Altres
 elucidates, the most that the Court of Appeals could have done in such a case is to dismiss the 
certiorari
 petition only with respect to the Ingleses who were not able to sign.
Second
. Nevertheless, the 
certiorari
 petition should be sustained as to all of the Ingleses since substantial compliance with the requirement of a certification against forum shopping may be appreciated in their favor. Jurisprudence clearly recognizes that 
âunder reasonable or justifiable circumstances x x x as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defenseâ
 the rule requiring all such petitioners or plaintiffs to sign the certification against forum shopping may be relaxed.
[141]
In this case, the â
reasonable or justifiable circumstance
â that would warrant a relaxation of the rule on the certification against forum shopping consists in the undeniable fact that Ingleses are immediate relatives of each other espousing but only one cause in their 
certiorari 
petition. A circumstance similar to that of the Ingleses was already recognized as valid by this Court in cases such as 
Traveno v. Bobongon Banana Growers Multi-Purpose Cooperative
[142]
 and in 
Cavile v. Heirs of Cavile
,
[143]
 just to name a few.
Given the above, no other conclusion can be had other than that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Inglesesâ certiorari petition based on technicality.
II
Rather than remanding the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition to the Court of Appeals, however, this Court chooses to herein resolve the merits of the same. This Court finds that a prompt resolution of the issue raised in the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition is necessary, for it will ultimately determine the progress of the proceedings in 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
. Hence, to avoid any further delay and to prevent the possibility of conflicting decisions between the Court of Appeals and the RTC, We resolve the Inglesesâ 
certiorari 
petition.
The pivotal issue in the Inglesesâ 
certiorari
 petition is whether the RTC, thru Judge Magpale, committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing Charles to present 
ex-parte
 evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession despite the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
.
The Ingleses submit an affirmative stance. The Ingleses posit that the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 effectively tied the resolution of Charlesâ application for a writ of possession with the resolution of their action for annulment of mortgage.
[144]
 For the Ingleses then, the RTC cannot simply allow Charles to present 
ex-parte
 evidence on his application for a writ possession without first laying to rest, in a judicial proceeding for that purpose, other related issues raised in 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
.
[145]
We deny the petition. The entire stance of the Ingleses hinges on the propriety of the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
. On that, this Court does not agree.
Consolidation of a Petition for the Issuance of a
 Writ of Possession with an Ordinary Civil Action,
 the Active Woods Doctrine and Subsequent Cases
As a rule, a petition for the issuance of a writ possession may not be consolidated with any other ordinary action. It is well-settled that a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession is 
ex-parte
, summary and non-litigious by nature; which nature would be rendered nugatory if such petition was to be consolidated with any other ordinary civil action.
[146]
The exception to the foregoing rule is the case of 
Active Wood Products, Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals
.
[147]
 In 
Active Wood
, this Court allowed the consolidation of a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession with an ordinary action for the annulment of mortgage. In doing so, 
Active Wood
 justified such consolidation as follows:
It is true that a petition for a writ of possession is made 
ex-parte
 to facilitate proceedings, being founded on a presumed right of ownership. 
Be that as it may, when this presumed right of ownership is contested and made the basis of another action, then the proceedings for writ of possession would also become seemingly groundless. The entire case must be litigated and if need be as in the case at bar, must be consolidated with a related case so as to thresh out thoroughly all related issues.
 (Emphasis supplied).
The unbridled construction of 
Active Wood
, however, led to a deplorable practice where mortgagors aggrieved by the result of an extrajudicial foreclosure would prevent possession by the successful purchaser by simply filing an action contesting the latterâs â
presumed right of ownership
â either by an annulment of mortgage or of the extrajudicial sale, and then asking the court for their consolidation with the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession. Needless to state, this abusive practice have reached the attention of this Court that, in turn, led to subsequent decisions refining the application of the 
Active Wood
 doctrine.
Hence, in
 Sps. De Vera v. Hon. Agloro
,
[148]
 this Court held that the consolidation of an action for the annulment of mortgage and extrajudicial sale with a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession, is not mandatory but still rests within the discretion of the trial court to allow. 
De Vera
 opined that â
when the rights of [a purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale] would be prejudiced x x x especially since [the latter] already adduced its evidence [in support of his application for a writ of possession]â
 consolidation of the two cases may rightfully be denied.
[149]
Amplifying further on 
Sps. De Vera 
is the case of 
Philippine National Bank v. Gotesco Tyan Ming Development, Inc.
[150]
 In 
Philippine National Bank
, this Court held that consolidation of an action for annulment of extrajudicial sale and a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession should not be allowed when doing so would actually lead to more delay in the proceedings and thus â
defeat the very rationale of consolidation
.â
[151]
 In the same case, this Court even ordered the separation of the then already consolidated action for the annulment of extrajudicial sale and petition for the issuance of a writ of possession.
[152]
But perhaps the most crucial refinement of 
Active Wood
 was in the case of 
Espinoza v. United Overseas Bank Phils
.
[153]
 Espinoza declared that the mere fact that the purchaserâs â
presumed right of ownership is contested and made the basis of another action
â does not mean that such action ought to be consolidated with the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession.
[154]
 For 
Espinoza
, the application of the 
Active Wood
 doctrine must be limited only to cases with the same factual circumstances under which the latter was rendered.
Espinoza
 called attention to the fact that in 
Active Wood
 the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession was â
filed before the expiration of the one-year redemption period
â and that 
âthe litigated property had not been consolidated in the name of the mortgagee
.â
[155]
  Hence, 
Espinoza
 invalidated the consolidation of an action for the annulment of the extrajudicial sale with a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession 
after
 finding that the latter petition was filed after the expiration of the one-year redemption period and 
after
 the purchaser had already consolidated his title over the auctioned property. This must be, 
Espinoza
 explained, because when:
x x x 
title to the litigated property had already been consolidated in the name of respondent,
 x x x 
the issuance of a writ of possession [becomes] a matter of right
. Consequently, the consolidation of the petition for the issuance of a writ of possession with the proceedings for nullification of foreclosure would be highly improper. Otherwise, not only will the very purpose of consolidation (which is to avoid unnecessary delay) be defeated but 
the procedural matter of consolidation will also adversely affect the substantive right of possession as an incident of ownership
.
[156]
 (Emphasis supplied).
Applying the foregoing judicial pronouncements to the case at bar, this Court discerns that the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) 
and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 had already ceased to become proper by the time the RTC allowed him to present ex-parte evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession. Separation of the two cases is moreover warranted. We substantiate:
Charles Has Already Consolidated 
His Title Over the Mortgaged Lots; 
No Grave Abuse of Discretion in
Allowing Charles to Present Ex- 
Parte Evidence
The ruling in 
Espinoza
 applies. It is uncontested that by the time he filed his 
Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession
, which was before the RTC allowed him to present 
ex-parte
 evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession, Charles had already consolidated his title over the ten (10) lots.
[157]
 At that time, Charles was already the absolute owner of the ten (10) lots and, as such, his right to possess the same becomes a matter of right on his part.
[158]
 Charlesâ claim of possession is no longer merely based on a â
presumed right of ownership
â as the Ingleses have evidently failed to exercise their right of redemption within the period provided by law. By then, the consolidation of Charlesâ application for a writ of possession with the Inglesesâ action for the annulment of mortgage had already lost its basis and, therefore, ceased to become proper. Consequently, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed on the part of the RTC in allowing Charles to present 
ex-parte
 evidence in support of his application for the issuance of a writ of possession.
Even though Charles filed his original 
Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ Possession
 still within the redemption period, 
Espinoza
 would nevertheless apply. Charlesâ subsequent filing of his 
Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession
 at a time that he was already absolute owner of the auctioned lots supplemented his earlier 
Ex-Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ Possession
âthus making his application for a writ of possession similar to that in the 
Espinoza
 case.
All in all, the Ingleses 
certiorari
 petition must therefore be dismissed.
Consolidation of LRC Case No. Q-
10766 (98) and Civil Case No. Q-
98-33277 Delayed Rather Than 
Expedited Resolution of Both Cases; 
Separation of Both Cases In Order
In addition, this Court finds that the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 had actually been counter-productive for the resolution of the two cases. It may not be amiss to point out that from the time 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 were consolidated
[159]
 up to time the RTC ordered a halt to their proceedings on 18 July 2004, more than four (4) years have already lapsed.  Yet in all those years, the records were still silent as to whether presentation of the evidence on the Inglesesâ annulment of the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 had already started. This circumstance alone casts immense doubt as to just how effective the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 was, in terms of finding an expeditious resolution for both cases. This Court cannot sanction such kind of procedure.
Considering that the consolidation of 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 serves no other useful purpose, this Court finds their separation to be in order.
G.R. No. 173641
We thus come to 
G.R. No. 173641
, which poses the lone issue of whether the Court of Appeals erred in granting Charlesâ 
mandamus
 petition praying for the immediate resolution by the RTC of the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration
,
[160]
 
Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration
[161]
 and 
Motion To Dismiss
.
[162]
The Ingleses argue in the affirmative and goes even further by saying that a suspension of the entire proceedings in 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277 
is called for.
[163]
 The Ingleses stand behind the 18 July 2004 Order of the RTC, thru Judge Corpuz-Cabochan, which ordered the suspension of the proceedings in view of the pendency of 
G.R. Nos. 141809
 and 
147186
 before this Court.
[164]
In view of our above discussions in 
G.R. Nos. 141809
 and 
147186
, there is no longer any legal reason on which the suspension of the proceedings before the RTC in 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
 and 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 may be anchored on. The two cases are ordered deconsolidated. 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 should proceed and be resolved with dispatch.  In 
LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98)
, the Writ of Possession in favor of Charles J. Esteban should be issued immediately. This is line with the order issued on 12 July 2001 by the Regional Trial Court granting the Ex Parte Petition for Issuance of a Writ of Possession after evaluating Charlesâ Memorandum and the Inglesesâ comment thereon.
Hence, We deny this petition.
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the consolidated petitions are hereby

 This complaint was actually a âre-filedâ complaint. The first complaint filed by the Ingleses for the annulment of the 
Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
 was filed on 6 December 1994 and was docketed as 
Civil Case No. Q-94-22332
. This first complaint, however, was dismissed without prejudice

 The 
Order
 actually ordered the consolidation of LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) with 
Civil Case No. 94-2232
 (Id. at 130-132). Later, by another order dated 9 March 1999, Branch 92 of the Quezon City RTC rectified the docket number of the civil case to which LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) is to be consolidated with, from Civil Case No. 94-2232 to 
Civil Case No. 94-22332
, 
see
 Records (LRC Case No. Q-10766 [98]), Volume I, p. 133. However, at the time the Order was issued, there was no longer a 
Civil Case No. 94-22332
 to speak of, as the same had already been dismissed, albeit without prejudice, as of 10 October 1997, see Records (LRC Case No. Q-10766 [98]), p. 38. What the 
Order
 could have meant was the consolidation of LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
âwhich is the new docket number assigned to the âre-filedâ complaint first dismissed without prejudice in 
Civil Case No. 94-22332
 and the only case pending in Branch 225 of the Quezon City RTC dealing with a similar set of facts. At any rate, LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) was 
in actuality
 consolidated with 
Civil Case No. Q-98-33277
 under Branch 225. The 
Order
 also denied the 
Motion to Dismiss and Opposition to the Petition
 filed by the Ingleses 
contra
 Charlesâ petition for the issuance of a writ of possession.

 Before LRC Case No. Q-10766 (98) and Civil Case No. Q-98-33277 were re-raffled, the resolution of the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration, Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration and Motion To Dismiss
 was initially brought before the sala of Judge Lucas P. Bersamin (who, at that time, was Presiding Judge of Branch 96 of the Quezon City, RTC, but is now an Associate Justice of this Court) in his capacity as pairing Judge of Branch 97. Then Judge Bersamin, in an Order dated 22 March of 2002, however, declined to resolve the Inglesesâ 
Motion For Reconsideration, Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration
 and 
Motion To Dismiss
 citing as his reason:
 âthe pendency of enumerable incidents attendant in these cases, thus, the interest of the parties will be better served if these cases will be heard by the regular judge.â

 Pertinent facts are these: Charles was able to register his Certificate of Sale on 24 July 1998 (Records of LRC Case No. Q-10766 
[98]
, Volume I, p. 7). Under Section 6 of Act No. 3135, the Ingleses have one (1) year from that time within which to exercise their right of redemption. 
The Ingleses, however, were unable to
. On 9 September 1999, Charles filed his 
Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Possession
 (Records of LRC Case No. Q-10766 [98], Volume I, pp. 139-143). On 7 February 2000, the RTC allowed Charles to present ex-parte evidence in support of his application for a writ of possession (Records of LRC Case No. Q-10766 [98], Volume I, pp. 438-439). Eventually on 2 February 2000, TCT Nos. 85825-34 of the Ingleses were cancelled and, in their stead, TCT Nos. N-210004 to 13 were issued in favor of Charles. (Records of LRC Case No. Q-10766
