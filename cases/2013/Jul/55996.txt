For said period, petitioner alleges that its input VAT included, among others, input VAT paid on purchases of capital goods amounting to P65,642,814.65. These purchases supposedly pertain to payment to contractors in connection with the construction of petitionerâs Sewage Treatment Plant, Water and Waste System, and Water Treatment Plant, broken down as follows:

On January 22, 2002, petitioner filed with Revenue District Office No. 44âPateros and Taguig, Revenue Region No. 8 of the BIR, an administrative claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P65,642,814.65 representing unutilized input VAT on capital goods purchased for the period beginning the 4th quarter of 1999 up to the 4th quarter of 2000.
The next day, petitioner filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period.
On March 29, 2005, the CTA Second Division rendered a Decision
[3]
 partially granting petitionerâs claim for refund in the reduced amount of P40,875,208.64.
In said case, the CTA Second Division held that an examination of the various official receipts presented by petitioner, to support its purchases for capital goods, shows that some of its purchases, such as rental, management fees and direct overhead, cannot be considered as capital goods. Further, it ruled that the official receipts under the name âBonifacio GDE Water Corporationâ were disallowed on the ground that the use of said business name by petitioner was never approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Thus, the court ruled as follows:
WHEREFORE
, in the light of the foregoing, the Petition for Review is 
PARTIALLY GRANTED
. The respondent is hereby 
ORDERED TO REFUND or TO ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE
 in favor of the petitioner in the reduced amount of P40,875,208.64, representing unutilized input VAT on capital goods for the period from the 4th quarter of 1999 to the 4th quarter of 2000, computed as follows:
 
 
Amount Claimed
 
P 65,642,814.65
 
 
 
Less: Disallowance per

Refundable Amount
 
P 40,875,208.64
 
 
SO ORDERED
.
[4]
The parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration against said Decision. However, in a Resolution
[5]
 dated August 23, 2005, the CTA Second Division held as follows:
In sum, the refundable amount to be granted to petitioner should be increased to P45,446,280.55, computed as follows:
 
 
Refundable Amount per Decision
 
 
P 40,875,208.64

Total Refundable Amount
 
 
P 45,446,280.55
 
 
IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING
, respondentâs Motion for Reconsideration is 
DENIED
 for lack of merit, while petitionerâs Motion for Partial Reconsideration is 
PARTIALLY GRANTED
.
Accordingly, respondent is 
ORDERED to REFUND
 or 
TO ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE
 in favor of petitioner in the increased amount of P45,446,280.55 as computed above.
SO ORDERED
.
[6]
Petitioner thereafter filed its petition for review with the CTA 
En Banc
 arguing that it has presented substantial evidence that proves its input VAT on purchases of capital goods from the 4
th
 quarter of 1999 to the 4
th
 quarter of 2000, as well as the fact that petitioner and âBonifacio GDE Corporationâ are one and the same entity.
In a Decision
[7]
 dated June 26, 2006, the CTA 
En Banc
 affirmed 
in toto
 the assailed Decision and Resolution of the CTA Second Division. The 
fallo
 of the Decision states:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Second Division [are] hereby 
AFFIRMED 
in toto
, and the Petition for Review is hereby 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
[8]
Unfazed, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration against said Decision, which was denied in a Resolution
[9]
 dated October 19, 2006.
Thus, the present petition wherein petitioner lists the following grounds in support of its petition:
GROUNDS FOR THE PETITION
PETITIONER RESPECTFULLY MOVES THAT THE ASSAILED DECISION DATED 26 JUNE 2006, AND THE RESOLUTION DATED 19 OCTOBER 2006, ISSUED BY THE CTA 
EN BANC
, BE SET ASIDE, BASED ON ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:
I
THE CTA 
EN BANC
 ERRED WHEN IT SANCTIONED THE PARTIAL DENIAL OF PETITIONERâS CLAIM FOR REFUND ON THE GROUND THAT PETITIONERâS INVOICES ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.
II
THE CTA 
EN BANC
 ERRED WHEN IT SANCTIONED THE PARTIAL DENIAL OF PETITIONERâS CLAIM FOR REFUND BY ITS FAILURE TO APPLY THE DEFINITION OF CAPITAL GOODS CONTAINED IN EXISTING JURISPRUDENCE TO CERTAIN PURCHASES OF PETITIONER.
III
THE CTA 
EN BANC
 FAILED TO APPLY THE RULES REGARDING JUDICIAL ADMISSIONS IN THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW.
IV
IN CIVIL CASES, SUCH AS CLAIMS FOR REFUND, STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL RULES OF EVIDENCE IS NOT REQUIRED. MOREOVER, A MERE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE WILL SUFFICE TO JUSTIFY THE GRANT OF A CLAIM. THE CTA 
EN BANC
 SANCTIONED THE USE OF A HIGHER STANDARD OF EVIDENCE IN A NON-CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.
[10]
Simply, the issue is whether or not the CTA 
En Banc
 erred in not granting petitionerâs claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P65,642,814.65.
Petitioner contends that non-compliance with the invoicing requirements under the 1997 Tax Code does not automatically result in the denial of a claim for refund or tax credit when the same is supported by substantial evidence. It contends that the CTA 
En Banc
 erred in sustaining the ruling that petitioner is not entitled to a refund of the input VAT evidenced by official receipts in the name of âBonifacio GDE Water Corporation.â
Petitioner further submits that the CTA erred in failing to properly apply the definition of capital goods and insists that services incurred in the construction and installation of capital assets and goods should be included in the cost of capital goods for purposes of determining the proper amount of refundable input VAT.
It also posits that respondent made an âinformal judicial admissionâ and partially recognized its claims for excess input VAT on purchases of capital goods when Revenue District No. 44 issued a memorandum acknowledging,
 inter alia,
 that the input taxes claimed as refund were duly supported by valid VAT invoices and/or receipts.
Lastly, petitioner asserts that the CTA imposed an overly strict standard of evidence in disallowing petitionerâs invoices bearing the name âBonifacio GDE Water Corporation.â It claims that the denial of the claim in its entirety based purely on technical grounds unduly deprives petitioner of a right granted by law and constitutes an undue deprivation of its property.
For its part, respondent argues that the instant petition raises purely questions of fact which is not allowed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. He highlights the fact that the issue of whether or not petitioner was able to present substantial evidence to prove and support its claim for tax refund or tax credit calls for this Court to review and evaluate all the evidence to enable it to determine and resolve the issues raised by petitioner.
Moreover, respondent avers that the CTA 
En Banc 
committed no error in not applying the rules regarding judicial admissions, since no judicial admission was made by or was attributable to respondent, either in the pleadings or in the course of the trial proceedings. He argues that the admission made by a subordinate BIR official in support of the course of action which he had proposed or submitted for approval by his superior cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered an admission, much less a judicial admission, of the latter.
Finally, respondent stresses that the CTA 
En Banc
 did not err in using stricter rules of evidence in cases involving claims for tax refund or tax credit as the same are in the nature of tax exemptions and are regarded as in derogation of sovereign authority and to be construed 
strictissimi juris
 against the entity claiming the exemption.
We agree with respondent.
At the outset, it must be emphasized that an appeal by petition for review on 
certiorari 
cannot determine factual issues. In the exercise of its power of review, the Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the re-examination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during trial.
[11]
 However, although the rules provide for certain recognized exceptions,
[12]
 the circumstances surrounding the present case do not fall under any of them.
Assuming, however, that this Court can take cognizance of the instant case, it bears stressing that the arguments raised by petitioner have already been extensively discussed by both the CTA Second Division and the CTA 
En Banc
, to wit:
Petitioner, in support of its first ground, argues that it has presented substantial evidence that unequivocally proved petitionerâs input VAT on purchases of capital goods from the 4
th
 quarter of 1999 to the 4
th
 quarter of 2000 as well as the fact that petitioner and Bonifacio GDE Corporation are one and the same entity.
We do not agree.
The change of name to Bonifacio GDE Corporation being unauthorized and without approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, petitioner cannot now seek for a refund of input taxes which are supported by receipts under that name. This is pursuant to Sections 4.104-5 and 4.108-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 in relation to Sections 113 and 237 of the Tax Code, reproduced below for easy reference.
x x x x
The requisite that the receipt be issued showing the name, business style, if any, and address of the purchaser, customer or client is precise so that when the books of accounts are subjected to a tax audit examination, all entries therein could be shown as adequately supported and proven as legitimate business transactions. The absence of official receipts issued in the taxpayerâs name is tantamount to non-compliance with the substantiation requirements provided by law.
Petitioner cannot raise the argument that, 
ânon-compliance with the invoicing requirements under the 1997 NIRC, as amended, does not automatically result in the denial of a claim for refund or tax credit when the same is supported by substantial evidenceâ and that, âIn civil cases, such as claims for refund, strict compliance with technical rules of evidence is not required. Moreover, a mere preponderance of evidence will suffice to justify the grant of a claim,
â in addition to its first ground in the instant petition. Taxpayers claiming for a refund or tax credit certificate must comply with the strict and mandatory invoicing and accounting requirements provided under the 1997 NIRC, as amended, and its implementing rules and regulations. Rules and regulations with regard to procedures are implemented not to be ignored or to be taken for granted, but are strictly adhered to for they are developed from the law itself. 
[13]
From the foregoing, it is clear that petitioner must show satisfaction of all the documentary and evidentiary requirements before an administrative claim for refund or tax credit will be granted. Perforce, the taxpayer claiming the refund must comply with the invoicing and accounting requirements mandated by the Tax Code, as well as the revenue regulations implementing them.
[14]
Thus, the change of petitionerâs name to âBonifacio GDE Water Corporation,â being unauthorized and without approval of the SEC, and the issuance of official receipts under that name which were presented to support petitionerâs claim for tax refund, cannot be used to allow the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate in petitionerâs favor. The absence of official receipts issued in its name is tantamount to non-compliance with the substantiation requirements provided by law and, hence,  the CTA 
En Banc
âs partial grant of its refund on that ground should be upheld.
Also, petitionerâs allegation that some of the disallowed input taxes paid on services related to the construction of petitionerâs Waste Water Treatment and Water Sewerage Distribution Networks, should be included as part of its capital goods, must fail. As comprehensively discussed by the CTA Second Division in its Resolution
[15]
 dated August 23, 2005 â
Petitioner alleges that the disallowed input taxes are paid on services related to the construction of petitionerâs Waste Water Treatment Plant and Water Sewerage Distribution Networks, summarized as follows:

Thus, it can be seen that the aforesaid expenses were correspondingly charged to âPre-Operating Expense,â âAccrued Expense,â âDirect Overhead,â âPrepaid Insurance,â and âConstruction in Progress.â

Only the above real accounts are to be considered as capital goods since âcapital goodsâ is defined as:
âCapital goods or propertiesâ refer to goods or properties with estimated useful life greater than one year and which are treated as depreciable assets under Section 29(f), used directly or indirectly in the production or sale of taxable goods or services.
Had petitioner intended the aforementioned itemized expenses to be part of Property, Plant & Equipment, then it should have recorded the same to the foregoing specific accounts. Except for the account âConstruction in Progress,â the other expense items do not fall within the definition of capital goods pursuant to Section 4.106-1(b) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.
[16]
As a final point, it is doctrinal that the Court will not lightly set aside the conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its function of being dedicated exclusively to the resolution of tax problems, has accordingly developed an expertise on the subject, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.
[17]
In fact, in 
Barcelon, Roxas Securities, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[18]
 this Court held that it accords the findings of fact by the CTA with the highest respect. It ruled that factual findings made by the CTA can only be disturbed on appeal if they are supported by substantial evidence or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the Tax Court. In the absence of any clear and convincing proof to the contrary, this Court must presume that the CTA rendered a decision which is valid in every respect.
[19]
In the present case, no cogent reason exists for this Court to deviate from this well-entrenched principle, since the CTA En Banc neither abused its authority nor committed gross error in partially denying petitionerâs refund claim.
WHEREFORE
