PEREZ, J.:


Assailed in this Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 filed pursuant to Rule 45 of the 
Rules of Court 
is the Decision
[1]
 dated 23 January 2007 rendered by the Fifteenth Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 84687,
[2]
 the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed January 27, 2005 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lucena City, Branch 59, in Civil Case No. 93-176, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered declaring the AGREEMENT and the KASUNDUAN 
void ab initio
 for being contrary to law and public policy, without prejudice to the attorneyâs filing a proper action for collection of reasonable attorneyâs fees based on 
quantum meruit 
and without prejudice also to administrative charges being filed against counsel for counselâs openly entering into such an illegal AGREEMENT in violation of the Canons of Professional Responsibility which action may be instituted with the Supreme Court which has exclusive jurisdiction to impose such penalties on members of the bar.
No pronouncement as to costs.
SO ORDERED.

 (Italics and Underscore Ours)
The Facts
Alongside her husband, 
Felipe
 Castillo, 
respondent Mauricia
 Meer Castillo was the owner of four parcels of land with an aggregate area of 53,307 square meters, situated in Silangan Mayao, Lucena City and registered in their names under Transfer Certificate of Title 
(TCT)
 Nos. T-42104, T-32227, T-31752 and T-42103. With the death of Felipe, a deed of extrajudicial partition over his estate was executed by his heirs, namely, Mauricia, 
Buenaflor
 Umali and 
respondents Victoria
 Castillo, 
Bertilla
 Rada, 
Marietta
 Cavanez, 
Leovina
 Jalbuena and 
Philip
 Castillo.  Utilized as security for the payment of a tractor purchased by Mauriciaâs nephew, Santiago Rivera, from 
Bormaheco
, Inc., it appears, however, that the subject properties were subsequently sold at a public auction where Insurance Corporation of the Philippines 
(ICP)
 tendered the highest bid. Having consolidated its title, ICP likewise sold said parcels in favor of Philippine Machinery Parts Manufacturing Co., Inc. 
(PMPMCI)
 which, in turn, caused the same to be titled in its name.
[4]
On 29 September 1976, respondents and Buenaflor instituted Civil Case No. 8085 before the then Court of First Instance 
(CFI)
 of Quezon, for the purpose of seeking the annulment of the transactions and/or proceedings involving the subject parcels, as well as the TCTs procured by PMPMCI.
[5]
  Encountering financial difficulties in the prosecution of Civil Case No. 8085, respondents and Buenaflor entered into an 
Agreement
 dated 20 September 1978 whereby they procured the legal services of 
Atty
. Edmundo 
Zepeda
 and the assistance of 
Manuel
 Uy Ek Liong who, as financier, agreed to underwrite the litigation expenses entailed by the case. In exchange, it was stipulated in the notarized Agreement that, in the event of a favorable decision in Civil Case No. 8085, Atty. Zepeda and Manuel would be entitled to âa share of forty (40%) percent of all the realties and/or monetary benefits, gratuities or damagesâ which may be adjudicated in favor of respondents.
[6]
On the same date, respondents and Buenaflor entered into another notarized agreement denominated as a 
Kasunduan
 whereby they agreed to sell their remaining sixty (60%) percent share in the subject parcels in favor of Manuel for the sum of P180,000.00. The parties stipulated that Manuel would pay a downpayment in the sum of P1,000.00 upon the execution of the 
Kasunduan
 and that respondents and Buenaflor would retain and remain the owners of a 1,750-square meter portion of said real properties. It was likewise agreed that any party violating the 
Kasunduan
 would pay the aggrieved party a penalty fixed in the sum of P50,000.00, together with the attorneyâs fees and litigation expenses incurred should a case be subsequently filed in court. The parties likewise agreed to further enter into such other stipulations as would be necessary to ensure that the sale would push through and/or in the event of illegality or impossibility of any part of the 
Kasunduan.
[7]
With his death on 19 August 1989,
[8]
 Manuel was survived by 
petitioners
, Heirs of Manuel Uy Ek Liong, who were later represented in the negotiations regarding the subject parcels and in this suit by 
petitioner Belen
 Lim Vda. de Uy.  The record also shows that the proceedings in Civil Case No. 8085 culminated in this Courtâs rendition of a 13 September 1990 Decision in G.R. No. 89561
[9]
 in favor of respondents and Buenaflor.
[10]
  Subsequent to the finality of the Courtâs Decision,
[11]
 it appears that the subject parcels were subdivided in accordance with the Agreement, with sixty (60%) percent thereof consisting of 31,983 square meters equally apportioned among and registered in the names of respondents and Buenaflor under TCT Nos. T-72027, T-72028, T-72029, T-72030, T-72031, T-72032 and T-72033.
[12]
 Consisting of 21,324 square meters, the remaining forty (40%) percent was, in turn, registered in the names of petitioners and Atty. Zepeda under TCT No. T-72026.
[13]
Supposedly acting on the advice of Atty. Zepeda, respondents wrote petitioners a letter dated 22 March 1993, essentially informing petitioners that respondents were willing to sell their sixty (60%) percent share in the subject parcels for the consideration of P500.00 per square meter.
[14]
  Insisting on the price agreed upon in the 
Kasunduan
, however, petitioners sent a letter dated 19 May 1993, requesting respondents to execute within 15 days from notice the necessary Deed of Absolute Sale over their 60% share as aforesaid, excluding the 1,750-square meter portion specified in their agreement with Manuel. Informed that petitioners were ready to pay the remaining P179,000.00 balance of the agreed price,
[15]
 respondents wrote a 28 May 1993 reply, reminding the former of their purported refusal of earlier offers to sell the shares of Leovina and of Buenaflor who had, in the meantime, died.
[16]
 In a letter dated 1 June 1993, respondents also called petitionersâ attention to the fact, among others, that their right to ask for an additional consideration for the sale was recognized under the 
Kasunduan
.
[17]
On 6 October 1993, petitioners commenced the instant suit with the filing of their complaint for specific performance and damages against the respondents and 
respondent
 Heirs of Buenaflor, as then represented by 
Menardo
 Umali. Faulting respondents with unjustified refusal to comply with their obligation under the 
Kasunduan
, petitioners prayed that the former be ordered to execute the necessary Deed of Absolute Sale over their shares in the subject parcels, with indemnities for moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorneyâs fees, litigation expenses and the costs of the suit.
[18]
 Served with summons, respondents filed their Answer with Counterclaim and Motion to File Third Party Complaint on 3 December 1993. Maintaining that the Agreement and the 
Kasunduan
 were illegal for being unconscionable and contrary to public policy, respondents averred that Atty. Zepeda was an indispensable party to the case. Together with the dismissal of the complaint and the annulment of said contracts and TCT No. T-72026, respondents sought the grant of their counterclaims for moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorneyâs fees and litigation expenses.
[19]
The issues thereby joined, the Regional Trial Court (
RTC
), Branch 54, Lucena City, proceeded to conduct the mandatory preliminary conference in the case.
[20]
 After initially granting respondentsâ motion to file a third party complaint against Atty. Zepeda,
[21]
 the RTC, upon petitionersâ motion for reconsideration,
[22]
 went on to issue the 18 July 1997 Order disallowing the filing of said pleading on the ground that the validity of the Agreement and the cause of action against Atty. Zepeda, whose whereabouts were then unknown, would be better threshed out in a separate action.
[23]
 The denial
[24]
 of their motion for reconsideration of the foregoing order
[25]
 prompted respondents to file a notice of appeal
[26]
 which was, however, denied due course by the RTC on the ground that the orders sought to be appealed were non-appealable.
[27]
 On 14 December 1997, Menardo died
[28]
 and was substituted by his daughter Nancy as representative of respondent Heirs of Buenaflor.
[29]
In the ensuing trial of the case on the merits, petitioners called to the witness stand Samuel Lim Uy Ek Liong
[30]
 whose testimony was refuted by Philip
[31]
 and Leovina
[32]
 during the presentation of the defense evidence. On 27 January 2005, the RTC rendered a decision finding the 
Kasunduan
 valid and binding between respondents and petitioners who had the right to demand its fulfillment as Manuelâs successors-in-interest.  Brushing aside Philipâs testimony that respondents were forced to sign the 
Kasunduan
, the RTC ruled that said contract became effective upon the finality of this Courtâs 13 September 1990 Decision in G.R. No. 89561 which served as a suspensive condition therefor. Having benefited from the legal services rendered by Atty. Zepeda and the financial assistance extended by Manuel, respondents were also declared estopped from questioning the validity of the Agreement, 
Kasunduan
 and TCT No. T-72026. With the 
Kasunduan 
upheld as the law between the contracting parties and their privies,
[33]
 the RTC disposed of the case in the following wise:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds for the [petitioners] and hereby:
1. Orders the [respondents] to execute and deliver a Deed of Conveyance in favor of the [petitioners] covering the 60% of the properties formerly covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-3175, 42104, T-42103, T-32227 and T-42104 which are now covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-72027, T-72028, T-72029, T-72030, T-72031, T-72032, T-72033 and T-72026, all of the Registry of Deeds of Lucena City, for and in consideration of the amount of P180,000.00 in accordance with the provisions of the 
KASUNDUAN
, and
2. Orders the [petitioners] to pay and deliver to the [respondents] upon the latterâs execution of the Deed of Conveyance mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the amount of P179,000.00 representing the balance of the purchase price as provided in the 
KASUNDUAN
, and
3. Orders the [respondents] to pay the [petitioners] the following amounts:
a). P50,000.00 as and for moral damages;
b). P50,000.00 as and for exemplary damages; and
c). P50,000.00 as and for attorneyâs fees.
and to pay the costs.
SO ORDERED.
[34]
Dissatisfied with the RTCâs decision, both petitioners
[35]
 and respondents perfected their appeals
[36]
 which were docketed before the CA as CA-G.R. CV No. 84687.  While petitioners prayed for the increase of the monetary awards adjudicated 
a quo
, as well as the further grant of liquidated damages in their favor,
[37]
 respondents sought the complete reversal of the appealed decision on the ground that the Agreement and the
 Kasunduan 
were null and void.
[38]
 On 23 January 2007, the CA rendered the herein assailed decision, setting aside the RTCâs decision, upon the following findings and conclusions, to wit: (a) the Agreement and 
Kasunduan
 are byproducts of the partnership between Atty. Zepeda and Manuel who, as a non-lawyer, was not authorized to practice law; (b) the
 Agreement
 is void under Article 1491 (5) of the 
Civil Code of the Philippines
 which prohibits lawyers from acquiring properties which are the objects of the litigation in which they have taken part; (c) jointly designed to completely deprive respondents of the subject parcels, the Agreement and the 
Kasunduan
 are invalid and unconscionable; and (d) without prejudice to his liability for violation of the Canons of Professional Responsibility, Atty. Zepeda can file an action to collect attorneyâs fees based on 
quantum meruit
.
[39]
The Issue
Petitioners seek the reversal of the CAâs decision on the following issue:
WHETHER [OR NOT] THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, FIFTEENTH DIVISION, COMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT REVERSED AND SET ASIDE THE DECISION OF THE RTC BRANCH 59, LUCENA CITY, IN CIVIL CASE NO. 93-176 DECLARING THE AGREEMENT AND KASUNDUAN VOID AB INITIO FOR BEING CONTRARY TO LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR BEING VIOLATIVE OF ART. 1491 OF THE NEW CIVIL CODE AND THE CANONS OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
.
[40]
The Courtâs Ruling
We find the petition impressed with partial merit.
At the outset, it bears pointing out that the complaint for specific performance filed before the RTC sought only the enforcement of petitionersâ rights and respondentsâ obligation under the 
Kasunduan
. Although the answer filed by respondents also assailed the validity of the Agreement and TCT No. T-72026, the record shows that the RTC, in its order dated 18 July 1997, disallowed the filing of a third-party complaint against Atty. Zepeda on the ground that the causes of action in respect to said contract and title would be better threshed out in a separate action. As Atty. Zepedaâs whereabouts were then unknown, the RTC also ruled that, far from contributing to the expeditious settlement of the case, the grant of respondentsâ motion to file a third-party complaint would only delay the proceedings in the case.
[41]
 With the 1 October 1998 denial of their motion for reconsideration of the foregoing order, respondents subsequently filed a notice of appeal which was, however, denied due course on the ground that the orders denying their motion to file a third-party complaint and their motion for reconsideration were interlocutory and non-appealable.
[42]
Absent a showing that the RTCâs ruling on the foregoing issues was reversed and set aside, we find that the CA reversibly erred in ruling on the validity of the Agreement which respondents executed not only with petitionersâ predecessor-in-interest, Manuel, but also with Atty. Zepeda.  Since it is generally accepted that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger,
[43]
 the rule is settled that a court must first acquire jurisdiction over a party â either through valid service of summons or voluntary appearance â for the latter to be bound by a court decision.
[44]
 The fact that Atty. Zepeda was not properly impleaded in the suit and given a chance to present his side of the controversy before the RTC should have dissuaded the CA from invalidating the Agreement and holding that attorneyâs fees should, instead, be computed on a 
quantum meruit
 basis. Admittedly, Article 1491 (5)
[45]
 of the 
Civil Code 
prohibits lawyers from acquiring by purchase or assignment the property or rights involved which are the object of the litigation in which they intervene by virtue of their profession. The CA lost sight of the fact, however, that the prohibition applies only during the pendency of the suit
[46]
 and generally does not cover contracts for contingent fees where the transfer takes effect only after the finality of a favorable judgment.
[47]
Although executed on the same day, it cannot likewise be gainsaid that the Agreement and the 
Kasunduan
 are independent contracts, with parties, objects and causes different from that of the other. Defined as a meeting of the minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other to give something or to render some service,
[48]
 a contract requires the concurrence of the following requisites: (a) consent of the contracting parties; (b) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and, (c) cause of the obligation which is established.
[49]
 Executed in exchange for the legal services of Atty. Zepeda and the financial assistance to be extended by Manuel, the Agreement concerned respondentsâ transfer of 40% of the avails of the suit, in the event of a favorable judgment in Civil Case No. 8085. While concededly subject to the same suspensive condition, the 
Kasunduan
 was, in contrast, concluded by respondents with Manuel alone, for the purpose of selling in favor of the latter 60% of their share in the subject parcels for the agreed price of P180,000.00. Given these clear distinctions, petitioners correctly argue that the CA reversibly erred in not determining the validity of the 
Kasunduan
 independent from that of the Agreement.
Viewed in the light of the autonomous nature of contracts enunciated under Article 1306
[50]
 of the 
Civil Code
, on the other hand, we find that the 
Kasunduan
 was correctly found by the RTC to be a valid and binding contract between the parties.  Already partially executed with respondentsâ receipt of P1,000.00 from Manuel upon the execution thereof, the 
Kasunduan
 simply concerned the sale of the formerâs 60% share in the subject parcel, less the 1,750-square meter portion to be retained, for the agreed consideration of P180,000.00. As a notarized document that carries the evidentiary weight conferred upon it with respect to its due execution,
[51]
 the 
Kasunduan
 was shown to have been signed by respondents with full knowledge of its contents, as may be gleaned from the testimonies elicited from Philip
[52]
 and Leovina.
[53]
Although Philip had repeatedly claimed that respondents had been forced to sign the Agreement and the 
Kasunduan
, his testimony does not show such vitiation of consent as would warrant the avoidance of the contract. He simply meant that respondents felt constrained to accede to the stipulations insisted upon by Atty. Zepeda and Manuel who were not otherwise willing to push through with said contracts.
[54]
At any rate, our perusal of the record shows that respondentsâ main objection to the enforcement of the 
Kasunduan
 was the perceived inadequacy of the P180,000.00 which the parties had fixed as consideration for 60% of the subject parcels. Rather than claiming vitiation of their consent in the answer they filed
 a quo
, respondents, in fact, distinctly averred that the 
Kasunduan
 was tantamount to unjust enrichment and âa clear source of speculative profitâ at their expense since their remaining share in said properties had âa current market value of P9,594,900.00, more or less.â
[55]
 In their 22 March 1993 letter to petitioners, respondents also cited prices then prevailing for the sale of properties in the area and offered to sell their 60% share for the price of P500.00 per square meter
[56]
 or a total of P15,991,500.00. In response to petitionersâ insistence on the price originally agreed upon by the parties,
[57]
 respondents even invoked the last paragraph
[58]
 of the 
Kasunduan
 to the effect that the parties agreed to enter into such other stipulations as would be necessary to ensure the fruition of the sale.
[59]
In the absence of any showing, however, that the parties were able to agree on new stipulations that would modify their agreement, we find that petitioners and respondents are bound by the original terms embodied in the 
Kasunduan
. Obligations arising from contracts, after all, have the force of law between the contracting parties
[60]
 who are expected to abide in good faith with their contractual commitments, not weasel out of them.
[61]
 Moreover, when the terms of the contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties, the rule is settled that the literal meaning of its stipulations should govern. In such cases, courts have no authority to alter a contract by construction or to make a new contract for the parties. Since their duty is confined to the interpretation of the one which the parties have made for themselves without regard to its wisdom or folly, it has been ruled that courts cannot supply material stipulations or read into the contract words it does not contain.
[62]
 Indeed, courts will not relieve a party from the adverse effects of an unwise or unfavorable contract freely entered into.
[63]
Our perusal of the 
Kasunduan
 also shows that it contains a penal clause
[64]
 which provides that a party who violates any of its provisions shall be liable to pay the aggrieved party a penalty fixed at P50,000.00, together with the attorneyâs fees and litigation expenses incurred by the latter should judicial resolution of the matter becomes necessary.
[65]
 An accessory undertaking to assume greater liability on the part of the obligor in case of breach of an obligation, the foregoing stipulation is a penal clause which serves to strengthen the coercive force of the obligation and provides for liquidated damages for such breach.
[66]
 âThe obligor would then be bound to pay the stipulated indemnity without the necessity of proof of the existence and the measure of damages caused by the breach.â
[67]
 Articles 1226 and 1227 of the 
Civil Code 
state:
Art. 1226. In obligations with a penal clause, the penalty shall substitute the indemnity for damages and the payment of interests in case of noncompliance, if there is no stipulation to the contrary. Nevertheless, damages shall be paid if the obligor refuses to pay the penalty or is guilty of fraud in the fulfillment of the obligation.
The penalty may be enforced only when it is demandable in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
Art. 1227. The debtor cannot exempt himself from the performance of the obligation by paying the penalty, save in the case where this right has been expressly reserved for him. Neither can the creditor demand the fulfilment of the obligation and the satisfaction of the penalty at the same time, unless this right has been clearly granted to him. However, if after the creditor has decided to require the fulfilment of the obligation, the performance thereof should become impossible without his fault, the penalty may be enforced.â
In the absence of a showing that they expressly reserved the right to pay the penalty in lieu of the performance of their obligation under the 
Kasunduan
, respondents were correctly ordered by the RTC to execute and deliver a deed of conveyance over their 60% share in the subject parcels in favor of petitioners. Considering that the 
Kasunduan
 stipulated that respondents would retain a portion of their share consisting of 1,700 square meters, said disposition should, however, be modified to give full effect to the intention of the contracting parties. Since the parties also fixed liquidated damages in the sum of P50,000.00 in case of breach, we find that said amount should suffice as petitionersâ indemnity, without further need of compensation for moral and exemplary damages.  In obligations with a penal clause, the penalty generally substitutes the indemnity for damages and the payment of interests in case of non-compliance.
[68]
 Usually incorporated to create an effective deterrent against breach of the obligation by making the consequences of such breach as onerous as it may be possible, the rule is settled that a penal clause is not limited to actual and compensatory damages
[69]
The RTCâs award of attorneyâs fees in the sum of P50,000.00 is, however, proper. Aside from the fact that the penal clause included a liability for said award in the event of litigation over a breach of the 
Kasunduan
, petitioners were able to prove that they incurred said sum in engaging the services of their lawyer to pursue their rights and protect their interests.
[70]
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Court of Appealsâ assailed 23 January 2007 Decision is 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE.
 In lieu thereof, the RTCâs 27 January 2005 Decision is 
REINSTATED
 subject to the following 
MODIFICATIONS
: (a) the exclusion of a 1,750-square meter portion from the 60% share in the subject parcel respondents were ordered to convey in favor of petitioners; and (b) the deletion of the awards of moral and exemplary damages. The rights of the parties under the Agreement may be determined in a separate litigation.
