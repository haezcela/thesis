ISABEL N. GUZMAN, PETITIONER, VS. ANIANO N. GUZMAN AND PRIMITIVA G. MONTEALTO, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




BRION, J.:


We resolve the petition for review on 
certiorari
,
[1]
 filed by petitioner Isabel N. Guzman, assailing the February 3, 2006 decision
[2]
 and the April 17, 2006 resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 90799. The CA decision dismissed the petitionerâs petition for 
certiorari
 for being the wrong mode of appeal and for lack of merit.  The CA resolution denied the petitionerâs motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.
THE FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS
On June 15, 2000, the petitioner filed with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 4, a complaint for ejectment against her children, respondents Aniano N. Guzman and Primitiva G. Montealto.
[4]
  The petitioner alleged that she and Arnold N. Guzman owned the 6/7
th
 and 1/7
th
 portions, respectively, of a 1,446-square meter parcel of land, known as Lot No. 2419-B, in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-74707;
[5]
 the respondents occupied the land by tolerance; the respondents did not comply with her January 17, 2000 written demand to vacate the property;
[6]
 and subsequent 
barangay
 conciliation proceedings failed to settle the differences between them.
[7]
In their answer,
[8]
 the respondents countered that the petitioner transferred, in a December 28, 1996 document,
[9]
 all her property rights in the disputed property, except her usufructuary right, in favor of her children, and that the petitioner engaged in forum shopping since she already raised the issue of ownership in a petition for cancellation of adverse claim against the respondents, pending with Branch 4 of the Regional Trial Court (
RTC
) of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan.
[10]
THE MTCâs RULING
In a November 27, 2002 decision,
[11]
  the MTC found the petitioner to be the lawful owner of the land with a right to its possession since the respondents had no vested right to the land since they are merely the petitionerâs children to whom no ownership or possessory rights have passed.  It held that the petitioner committed no forum shopping since she asserted ownership only to establish her right of possession, and the lower courts can 
provisionally 
resolve the issue of ownership to determine who has the better right of possession.  The MTC directed the respondents to vacate the land and surrender possession to the petitioner, and to pay P5,000.00 as monthly rental from January 2000 until possession is surrendered, plus P15,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.
The respondents appealed to the RTC of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, Branch 1.
[12]
  They argued that: (a) the MTC had no jurisdiction over the case; (b) the petitioner has no cause of action against the respondents; (c) the petitioner engaged in forum shopping; and (d) the MTC erred in deciding the case in the petitionerâs favor.
[13]
THE RTCâs RULING
In its May 19, 2005 decision,
[14]
 the RTC rejected the respondentsâ arguments, finding that the MTC has jurisdiction over ejectment cases under Section 33(2) of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129;
[15]
 the petitioner has a valid cause of action against the respondents since the complaint alleged the petitionerâs ownership, the respondentsâ possession by tolerance, and the respondentsâ refusal to vacate upon the petitionerâs demand; and, the petitioner did not engage in forum shopping since the petition for the cancellation of adverse claim has a cause of action totally different from that of ejectment.
The RTC, however, still ruled for the respondents and set aside the MTC ruling.  It took into account the petitionerâs transfer of rights in the respondentsâ favor which, it held, could not be unilaterally revoked without a court action.  It also noted that the petitioner failed to allege and prove that earnest efforts at a compromise have been exerted prior to the filing of the complaint.
[16]
  Thus, the RTC ordered the petitioner to pay the respondents P25,000.00 as attorneyâs fees and P25,000.00 as litigation expenses.
On June 16, 2005, the petitioner received a copy of the RTC decision.
[17]
  On June 30, 2005, the petitioner filed her
 first motion for reconsideration.
[18]
  In its July 6, 2005 order,
[19]
 the RTC denied the petitionerâs motion for reconsideration for lack of the required notice of hearing.
[20]
On July 14, 2005, the petitioner filed a
 second motion for reconsideration.
[21]
 In its July 15, 2005 order,
[22]
 the RTC denied the second motion for reconsideration for having been filed out of time.
On July 20, 2005, the petitioner filed a
 third motion for reconsideration
.
[23]
 In its July 22, 2005 order,
[24]
 the RTC denied the third motion for reconsideration with finality.
On August 8, 2005, the petitioner filed a Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari
 with the CA, alleging that the RTC committed a grave abuse of discretion: (a) in deciding the case based on matters not raised as issues on appeal; (b) in finding that the transfer of rights could not be unilaterally revoked without a court action; (c) in holding that the petitioner failed to prove that earnest efforts at a compromise have been exerted prior to the filing of the complaint; and (d) in denying the petitionerâs motion for reconsideration on a mere technicality.
THE CAâs RULING
In its February 3, 2006 decision,
[25]
 the CA dismissed the petition. The CA noted that a Rule 42 petition for review, not a Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari
, was the proper remedy to assail an RTC decision rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. It found that the petitioner lost her chance to appeal when she filed a second motion for reconsideration, a prohibited pleading under Section 5, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court. The CA also held that the petitioner cannot validly claim that the respondents occupied the properties through mere tolerance since they were co-owners of the property as compulsory heirs of Alfonso Guzman, the original owner.
When the CA denied
[26]
 the motion for reconsideration
[27]
 that followed, the petitioner filed the present Rule 45 petition.
THE PETITION
The petitioner justifies the filing of a Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari 
with the CA by claiming that the RTC judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in passing on issues not raised in the appeal and in not relaxing the rule on the required notice of hearing on motions. She further argues that the CAâs finding of co-ownership is bereft of factual and legal basis.
THE CASE FOR THE RESPONDENTS
The respondents submit that the proper remedy for appealing a decision of the RTC, exercising appellate jurisdiction, is a Rule 42 petition for review, and that a Rule 65 petition for certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal.
THE ISSUE
The case presents to us the issue of whether the CA committed a reversible error in dismissing the petitionerâs petition for 
certiorari.
THE COURTâs RULING
The petition lacks merit.
The petitioner availed of the wrong remedy
The petitionerâs resort to a Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari
 to assail the RTC decision and orders is misplaced. When the RTC issued its decision and orders, it did so in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction; the proper remedy therefrom is a Rule 42 petition for review.
[28]
 Instead, the petitioner filed a second motion for reconsideration and thereby lost her right to appeal; a second motion for reconsideration being a prohibited pleading pursuant to Section 5, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.
[29]
 The petitionerâs subsequent motions for reconsideration should be considered as mere scraps of paper, not having been filed at all, and unable to toll the reglementary period for an appeal.
The RTC decision became final and executory after fifteen (15) days from receipt of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration. It is elementary that once a decision becomes final and executory, it is âimmutable and unalterable, and can no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land.â
[30]
 Thus, the RTC decision, even if allegedly erroneous, can no longer be modified.
Apparently, to resurrect her lost appeal, the petitioner filed a Rule 65 petition for 
certiorari
, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the RTC for deciding the case against her. 
Certiorari
, by its very nature, is proper only when appeal is not available to the aggrieved party; the remedies of appeal and 
certiorari 
are mutually exclusive, not alternative or successive.
[31]
  It cannot substitute for a lost appeal, especially if one's own negligence or error in one's choice of remedy occasioned such loss or lapse.
[32]
No grave abuse of discretion
In any case, even granting that the petition can be properly filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, we hold that it was bound to fail.
It should be noted that as a legal recourse, 
certiorari
 is a limited form of review.
[33]
  It is restricted to resolving errors of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion, not errors of judgment.
[34]
  Indeed, as long as the lower courts act within their jurisdiction, alleged errors committed in the exercise of their discretion will amount to mere errors of judgment correctable by an appeal or a petition for review.
[35]
In this case, the imputed errors pertained to the RTCâs appreciation of matters not raised as errors on appeal, specifically, the transfer of rights and subsequent unilateral revocation, and the strictly enforced rule on notice of hearing. These matters involve only the RTCâs appreciation of facts and its application of the law; the errors raised do not involve the RTCâs jurisdiction, but merely amount to a claim of erroneous exercise of judgment.
Besides, the RTC acted within its jurisdiction in considering the matter of the petitionerâs transfer of rights, even if it had not been raised as an error. Under Section 18, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court,
[36]
 the RTC is mandated to decide the appeal based on the entire record of the MTC proceedings and such pleadings submitted by the parties or required by the RTC. Nonetheless, even without this provision, an appellate court is clothed with ample authority to review matters, even if they are not assigned as errors on appeal, if it finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just decision of the case, or is closely related to an error properly assigned, or upon which the determination of the question raised by error properly assigned is dependent.
[37]
 The matter of the petitionerâs transfer of rights, which was in the records of the case, was the basis for the RTCâs decision.
The RTC did not also commit a grave abuse of discretion in strictly enforcing the requirement of notice of hearing.  The requirement of notice of hearing is an integral component of procedural due process that seeks to avoid âsurprises that may be sprung upon the adverse party, who must be given time to study and meet the arguments in the motion before a resolution by the court.â
[38]
 Given the purpose of the requirement, a motion unaccompanied by a notice of hearing is considered a mere scrap of paper that does not toll the running of the period to appeal. This requirement of notice of hearing equally applies to the petitionerâs motion for reconsideration.
[39]
 The petitionerâs alleged absence of counsel is not a valid excuse or reason for non-compliance with the rules.
A final point
Ejectment cases are summary proceedings intended to provide an expeditious means of protecting actual possession or right of possession of property. Title is not involved, hence, it is a special civil action with a special procedure. The only issue to be resolved in ejectment cases is the question of entitlement to the physical or material possession of the premises or possession 
de facto.
 Thus, any ruling on the question of ownership is only provisional, made solely for the purpose of determining who is entitled to possession
 de facto.
[40]
 Accordingly, any ruling on the validity of the petitionerâs transfer of rights is provisional and should be resolved in a proper proceeding.
