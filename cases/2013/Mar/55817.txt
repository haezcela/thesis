REYES, J.:


Reserva troncal
 is a special rule designed primarily to assure the return of a reservable property to the third degree relatives belonging to the line from which the property originally came, and avoid its being dissipated into and by the relatives of the inheriting ascendant.
[1]
The Facts
The properties subject in the instant case are three parcels of land located in Sta. Maria, Bulacan:  (1) Lot 1681-B, with an area of 7,749 square meters;
[2]
 (2) Lot 1684, with an area of 5,667 sq m;
[3]
 and (3) Lot No. 1646-B, with an area of 880 sq m.
[4]
  Lot Nos. 1681-B and 1684 are presently in the name of respondent Julia Delos Santos
[5]
 (respondent).  Lot No. 1646-B, on the other hand, is also in the name of respondent but co-owned by Victoria Pantaleon, who bought one-half of the property from petitioner Maria Mendoza and her siblings.
Petitioners are grandchildren of Placido Mendoza (Placido) and Dominga Mendoza (Dominga).  Placido and Dominga had four children: Antonio, Exequiel, married to Leonor, Apolonio and Valentin.  Petitioners Maria, Deogracias, Dionisia, Adoracion, Marcela and Ricardo are the children of Antonio.  Petitioners Juliana, Fely, Mercedes, Elvira and Fortunato, on the other hand, are Valentinâs children.  Petitioners alleged that the properties were part of Placido and Domingaâs properties that were subject of an oral partition and subsequently adjudicated to Exequiel.  After Exequielâs death, it passed on to his spouse Leonor and only daughter, Gregoria.  After Leonorâs death, her share went to Gregoria.  In 1992, Gregoria died intestate and without issue.  They claimed that after Gregoriaâs death, respondent, who is Leonorâs sister, adjudicated unto herself all these properties as the sole surviving heir of Leonor and Gregoria.  Hence, petitioners claim that the properties should have been reserved by respondent in their behalf and must now revert back to them, applying Article 891 of the Civil Code on 
reserva troncal
.
Respondent, however, denies any obligation to reserve the properties as these did not originate from petitionersâ familial line and were not originally owned by Placido and Dominga.  According to respondent, the properties were bought by Exequiel and Antonio from a certain Alfonso Ramos in 1931.  It appears, however, that it was only Exequiel who was in possession of the properties.
[6]
The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 6, found merit in petitionersâ claim and granted their action for Recovery of Possession by 
Reserva Troncal
, Cancellation of TCT and Reconveyance.  In its Decision dated November 4, 2002, the RTC disposed as follows:
WHEREFORE, premised from the foregoing judgment [is] hereby rendered:
1.  Ordering [respondents] (heirs of Julia Policarpio) to reconvey the three (3) parcels of land subject of this action in the name of the plaintiffs enumerated in the complaint including intervenor Maria Cecilia M. Mendoza except one-half of the property described in the old title[,] TCT No. T-124852(M) which belongs to Victorina Pantaleon;
2.  Ordering the Register of Deeds of Bulacan to cancel the titles in the name of Julia Policarpio[,] TCT No. T-149033(M), T-183631(M) and T-149035(M) and reconvey the same to the enumerated plaintiffs; [and]
3.  No pronouncement as to claims for attorneyâs fees and damages and costs.
SO ORDERED.
[7]
On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed and set aside the RTC decision and dismissed the complaint filed by petitioners.  The dispositive portion of the CA Decision dated November 16, 2006 provides:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the November 4, 2002 
Decision
 of the Regional Trial Court, Br. 6, Third Judicial Region, Malolos, Bulacan, is 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE.
  The Third Amended Complaint in Civil Case No. 609-M-92 is hereby 
DISMISSED
.  Costs against the Plaintiffs-Appellants.
SO ORDERED
.
[8]
Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but the CA denied the same per Resolution
[9]
 dated January 17, 2007.
In dismissing the complaint, the CA ruled that petitioners failed to establish that Placido and Dominga owned the properties in dispute.
[10]
  The CA also ruled that even assuming that Placido and Dominga previously owned the properties, it still cannot be subject to 
reserva troncal
 as neither Exequiel predeceased Placido and Dominga nor did Gregoria predecease Exequiel.
[11]
Now before the Court, petitioners argue that:
A.
THE HONORABLE [CA] GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES ARE NOT RESERVABLE PROPERTIES, COMING AS THEY DO FROM THE FAMILY LINE OF THE PETITIONERS MENDOZAS.
B.
THE HONORABLE [CA] GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE PETITIONERS MENDOZAS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES BY VIRTUE OF THE LAW ON 
RESERVA TRONCAL.
[12]
Petitioners take exception to the ruling of the CA, contending that it is sufficient that the properties came from the paternal line of Gregoria for it to be subject to 
reserva troncal.
  They also claim the properties in representation of their own predecessors, Antonio and Valentin, who were the brothers of Exequiel.
[13]
Ruling of the Court
This petition is one for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.  The general rule in this regard is that it should raise only questions of law.  There are, however, admitted exceptions to this rule, one of which is when the CAâs findings are contrary to those of the trial court.
[14]
  This being the case in the petition at hand, the Court must now look into the differing findings and conclusion of the RTC and the CA on the two issues that arise â 
one
, whether the properties in dispute are reservable properties and 
two
, whether petitioners are entitled to a reservation of these properties.
Article 891 of the Civil Code 
on 
reserva troncal 
 
The principle of 
reserva troncal 
is provided in Article 891 of the Civil Code:
Art. 891. The ascendant who inherits from his descendant any property which the latter may have acquired by gratuitous title from another ascendant, or a brother or sister, is obliged to reserve such property as he may have acquired by operation of law 
for the benefit of relatives who are within the third degree and belong to the line from which said property came
. (Emphasis ours)
There are three (3) lines of transmission in 
reserva troncal
.  The
 first transmission
 is by gratuitous title, whether by inheritance or donation, from an ascendant/brother/sister to a descendant called the 
prepositus
.  The 
second transmission
 is by operation of law from the 
prepositus
 to the other ascendant or reservor, also called the 
reservista
.  The 
third and last transmission
 is from the 
reservista
 to the reservees or 
reservatarios
 who must be relatives within the third degree from which the property came.
[15]
The lineal character of the reservable
 property is reckoned from the ascendant
 from whom the 
prepositus
 received the property
 by gratuitous title
Based on the circumstances of the present case, Article 891 on 
reserva troncal
 is not applicable. (
please see image, Decision G.R. No. 176422, p. 5
)
The fallacy in the CAâs resolution is that it proceeded from the erroneous premise that Placido is the ascendant contemplated in Article 891 of the Civil Code.  From thence, it sought to trace the origin of the subject properties back to Placido and Dominga, determine whether Exequiel predeceased Placido and whether Gregoria predeceased Exequiel.
The persons involved in
 reserva troncal 
are:
 
 
(1) 
 
The ascendant or brother or sister from whom the property was received by the descendant by lucrative or gratuitous title; 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
The descendant or prepositus (
propositus
) who received the property;
 
 
 
(3)
 
 
The reservor (
reservista
), the other ascendant who obtained the property from the prepositus by operation of law; and
 
 
 
(4) 
 
The reservee (
reservatario
) who is within the third degree from the prepositus and who belongs to the (
linea o tronco
) from which the property came and for whom the property should be reserved by the reservor.
[16]
 
 
It should be pointed out that the ownership of the properties should be reckoned only from Exequielâs as he is the ascendant from where the first transmission occurred, or from whom Gregoria inherited the properties in dispute.  The law does not go farther than such ascendant/brother/sister in determining the lineal character of the property.
[17]
  It was also immaterial for the CA to determine whether Exequiel predeceased Placido and Dominga or whether Gregoria predeceased Exequiel.  What is pertinent is that Exequiel owned the properties and he is the ascendant from whom the properties in dispute originally came.  Gregoria, on the other hand, is the descendant who received the properties from Exequiel by gratuitous title.
Moreover, Article 891 simply requires that the property should have been acquired by the descendant or 
prepositus
 from an ascendant by gratuitous or lucrative title.  A transmission is gratuitous or by gratuitous title when the recipient does not give anything in return.
[18]
  At risk of being repetitious, what was clearly established in this case is that the properties in dispute were owned by Exequiel (ascendant).  After his death, Gregoria (descendant/
prepositus
) acquired the properties as inheritance.
Ascendants, descendants and collateral
 relatives under Article 964 of the Civil Code
Article 891 provides that the person obliged to reserve the property should be an ascendant (also known as the reservor/
reservista
) of the descendant/
prepositus
.  Julia, however, is not Gregoriaâs ascendant; rather, she is Gregoriaâs collateral relative.
Article 964 of the Civil Code provides for the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants, and those who are not ascendants and descendants but come from a common ancestor, 
viz
:
Art. 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.
A 
direct line
 is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants.
A 
collateral line
 is that constituted by the series of degrees among persons 
who are not ascendants and descendants
, but who come from a common ancestor. (Emphasis and italics ours)
Gregoriaâs ascendants are her parents, Exequiel and Leonor, her grandparents, great-grandparents and so on.  On the other hand, Gregoriaâs descendants, if she had one, would be her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  Not being Gregoriaâs ascendants, both petitioners and Julia, therefore, are her collateral relatives.  In determining the collateral line of relationship, ascent is made to the common ancestor and then descent to the relative from whom the computation is made.  In the case of Juliaâs collateral relationship with Gregoria, ascent is to be made from Gregoria to her mother Leonor (one line/degree), then to the common ancestor, that is, Julia and Leonorâs parents (second line/degree), and then descent to Julia, her aunt (third line/degree).  Thus, Julia is Gregoriaâs 
collateral
 relative within the third degree and not her ascendant.
First cousins of the descendant/
prepositus
 
are fourth degree relatives and cannot be
 considered reservees/
reservatarios
Moreover, petitioners cannot be considered reservees/
reservatarios
 as they are not relatives within the third degree of Gregoria from whom the properties came.  The person from whom the degree should be reckoned is the descendant/
prepositus
âthe one at the end of the line from which the property came and upon whom the property last revolved by descent.
[19]
  It is Gregoria in this case.  Petitioners are Gregoriaâs fourth degree relatives, being her first cousins.  
First cousins of the 
prepositus
 are fourth degree relatives and
 are not reservees or 
reservatarios
.
[20]
They cannot even claim representation of their predecessors Antonio and Valentin as Article 891 grants a personal right of reservation only to the relatives up to the third degree from whom the reservable properties came. The only recognized exemption is in the case of nephews and nieces of the prepositus, who have the right to represent their ascendants (fathers and mothers) who are the brothers/sisters of the 
prepositus
 and relatives within the third degree.
[21]
  In 
Florentino v. Florentino
,
[22]
 the Court stated:
Following the order prescribed by law in legitimate succession, when there are relatives of the descendant within the third degree, the right of the nearest relative, called reservatario, over the property which the reservista (person holding it subject to reservation) should return to him, excludes that of the one more remote.  The right of representation cannot be alleged when the one claiming same as a reservatario of the reservable property is not among the relatives within the third degree belong to the line from which such property came, inasmuch as 
the right granted by the Civil Code in [A]rticle 811 [now Article 891] is in the highest degree 
personal and for the exclusive benefit of the designated persons who are the relatives, within the third degree
, of the person from whom the reservable property came.  Therefore, 
relatives of the fourth and the succeeding degrees can never be considered as 
reservatarios
, since the law does not recognize them as such.
x x x [N]evertheless there is right of representation on the part of reservatarios who are within the third degree mentioned by law, as in the case of nephews of the deceased person from whom the reservable property came. x x x.
[23]
  (Emphasis and underscoring ours)
The conclusion, therefore, is that while it may appear that the properties are reservable in character, petitioners cannot benefit from 
reserva troncal
.  
First, 
because Julia, who now holds the properties in dispute, is not the other ascendant within the purview of Article 891 of the Civil Code and second, because petitioners are not Gregoriaâs relatives within the third degree.  Hence, the CAâs disposition that the complaint filed with the RTC should be dismissed, only on this point, is correct.  If at all, what should apply in the distribution of Gregoriaâs estate are Articles 1003 and 1009 of the Civil Code, which provide:
Art. 1003. If there are no descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children, or a surviving spouse, the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased in accordance with the following articles.
Art. 1009. Should there be neither brothers nor sisters, nor children of brothers or sisters, the other collateral relatives shall succeed to the estate.
The latter shall succeed without distinction of lines or preference among them by reason of relationship by the whole blood.
Nevertheless, the Court is not in the proper position to determine the proper distribution of Gregoriaâs estate at this point as the cause of action relied upon by petitioners in their complaint filed with the RTC is based solely on 
reserva troncal
.  Further, any determination would necessarily entail reception of evidence on Gregoriaâs entire estate and the heirs entitled thereto, which is best accomplished in an action filed specifically for that purpose.
A 
reservista 
acquires ownership of the reservable
 property until the reservation takes place or is
 extinguished
Before concluding, the Court takes note of a palpable error in the RTCâs disposition of the case.  In upholding the right of petitioners over the properties, the RTC ordered the reconveyance of the properties to petitioners and the transfer of the titles in their names.  What the RTC should have done, assuming for argumentâs sake that 
reserva troncal
 is applicable, is have the reservable nature of the property registered on respondentâs titles. In fact, respondent, as 
reservista,
 has the duty to reserve and to annotate the reservable character of the property on the title.
[24]
  In reserva troncal, the reservista who inherits from a 
prepositus
, whether by the latterâs wish or by operation of law, acquires the inheritance by virtue of a title perfectly transferring absolute ownership.  All the attributes of ownership belong to him exclusively.
[25]
The reservor has the legal title and dominion to the reservable property but subject to the resolutory condition that such title is extinguished if the reservor predeceased the reservee. The reservor is a usufructuary of the reservable property. He may alienate it subject to the reservation. The transferee gets the revocable and conditional ownership of the reservor. The transfereeâs rights are revoked upon the survival of the reservees at the time of the death of the reservor but become indefeasible when the reservees predecease the reservor.
[26]
  (Citations omitted)
It is when the reservation takes place or is extinguished,
[27]
 that a 
reservatario 
becomes, by operation of law, the owner of the reservable property.
[28]
  In any event, the foregoing discussion does not detract from the fact that petitioners are not entitled to a reservation of the properties in dispute.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED
.  The Decision dated November 16, 2006 and Resolution dated January 17, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 77694 insofar as it dismissed the Third Amended Complaint in Civil Case No. 609-M-92 are 
AFFIRMED
.  This Decision is without prejudice to any civil action that the heirs of Gregoria Mendoza may file for the settlement of her estate or for the determination of ownership of the properties in question.
