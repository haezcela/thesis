[ G.R. No. 215925, March 07, 2022 ]


ESPERANZA P. GAOIRAN, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, BRANCH 12 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF ILOCOS NORTE, SPS. TIMOTEO S. PABLO AND PERLITA PABLO, MARY NYRE DAWN S. ALCANTARA, AND REGISTER OF DEEDS OF LAOAG CITY, RESPONDENTS.

HERNANDO, J.:[*]


Before this Court is a petition for 
certiorari
[1]

 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Esperanza P. 
Gaoiran, seeking the reversal of the August 15, 2014 Decision
[2]
 and November 14, 2014 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 129945.
  
 The property subject of the instant petition is a 275-square 
meter parcel of land situated in Barangay Poblacion San Miguel & San
 Pedro, City of Laoag, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
(TCT) T-34540 issued under the name of respondent Perlita S. Pablo 
(Perlita), married to Timoteo Pablo (Timoteo).
[4]


 Petitioner alleged that on September 22, 2009, her friends 
introduced to her a certain Timoteo H. Pablo, Jr. who was allegedly 
looking for a buyer of a land registered under the name of his wife, 
Perlita S. Pablo. Timoteo offered for sale the subject property to 
petitioner and her husband. Timoteo was able to convince petitioner to 
purchase the said property upon the representation that he was 
authorized by his wife, Perlita to sell the same. On the same day, 
petitioner delivered the purchase price to Timoteo in the amount of 
P500,000.00 and in exchange, Timoteo surrendered the first owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 to petitioner and undertook to deliver a 
deed of absolute sale signed by his wife on or before October 22, 2009. 
Timoteo, however, did not make good his promise.
[5]


 Demands were made by petitioner upon Timoteo to return the 
amount of P500,000.00 or to deliver the appropriate deed of conveyance, 
but to no vail. This prompted petitioner to institute before the Office 
of the City Prosecutor of Laoag City a complaint for Estafa against 
Timoteo.
[6]
 Finding probable 
cause, an Information for Estafa was filed before the RTC of Laoag City,
 Branch 14 docketed as Criminal Case No. 14608.
[7]


 On June 8, 2012, petitioner executed an affidavit of possession with notice of lis pendens
[8]

 and brought the same to the Register of Deeds of Laoag City (RD-Laoag) 
for annotation of an adverse claim in TCT T-34540. However, the RD-Laoag
 advised her that the said complaint, being criminal and not civil in 
nature, cannot be annotated in the original certificate of title.
[9]

 Meanwhile, on the claim that the owner's duplicate copy of the subject 
property's title was missing, respondent Mary Nyre Dawn Alcantara 
(Mary), representing herself as the niece of respondent Perlita, and the
 latter's trustee of TCT T-34540, filed before the RTC of Laoag City on 
June 25, 2012 a petition
[10]
 
praying that the owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 that had been 
lost be declared as null and void. She likewise prayed for the issuance 
of a second owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540.
[11]

 In support of the said petition, Mary submitted an affidavit of loss on
 June 14, 2012 duly notifying the Register of Deeds of the lost title. 
The same had been annotated at the back of TCT T-34540.
[12]

 Perlita also executed an affidavit stating that she had entrusted the 
owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 to Mary being her administrator 
and overseer but the same was lost in the latter's possession. Hence, 
she encouraged Mary to file a petition for the issuance of a new owner's
 duplicate title in lieu of the lost one.
[13]

 Finding sufficient, competent and credible evidence in support of the 
petition for issuance of a new owner's duplicate certificate of title, 
the RTC of Laoag City, Branch 12, in a Decision
[14]

 dated August 28, 2012, ordering the issuance of a second owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT T-34540. Pursuant to which, the RTC of Laoag City 
declared the lost owner's duplicate copy as null and void.
[15]
 On May 17, 2013, petitioner instituted before the CA a petition for annulment of judgment
[16]

 seeking to annul the August 28, 2012 Decision of the RTC of Laoag City,
 which granted Mary's petition for the issuance of a second owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT T-34540. Petitioner averred that it was only on 
April 10, 2013, upon her inquiry with the RD-Laoag about the status of 
the aforesaid title, that she discovered that a second owner's duplicate
 copy of TCT T-34540 was issued in favor of Perlita pursuant to an 
affidavit of loss executed by Mary on June 14, 2012, attesting to the 
loss of the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540, which she 
registered with the RD-Laoag. In view of the foregoing incidents, 
petitioner filed the aforesaid petition for annulment of judgment before
 the CA on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. 
Essentially, she contended that the reconstituted title was obtained by 
the respondents by means of fraud and deceit. She further argued that 
the RTC had no jurisdiction to issue a new title as the first owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 was never lost, and in fact, is in her 
possession all along.
[17]
 
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
 

 On August 15, 2014, the CA dismissed the petition for annulment of 
judgment declaring that a petition under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court 
cannot be used to impugn the second owner's duplicate certificate of 
title which was issued in the reconstitution proceeding before the trial
 court for to do so would constitute a collateral attack upon the issued
 certificate of title which is sanctioned by Section 48 of Presidential 
Decree No. (PD) 1529.
[18]
 
 The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads: 
  


 Accordingly, in view of the foregoing premises, and consistent with the 
caveat

 in the first paragraph of Section 5, Rule 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
 Procedure, the Petition for Annulment of Judgment is hereby 
DISMISSED
. 


 
SO ORDERED
.
[19]




 Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied by the CA in a Resolution
[20]
 dated November 14, 2014.
 Hence, this petition for 
certiorari
 imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA. 
 
Issue


 The issue before the Court is whether or not the CA committed 
grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition for annulment of 
judgment. 
 Petitioner insists that the existence of the owner's 
duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 in her possession renders the RTC of Laoag
 City devoid of any jurisdiction to entertain Mary's petition for 
issuance of a second owner's duplicate copy. Moreover, the petition for 
annulment of judgment she filed before the CA is not an attack upon TCT 
T-34540, the main purpose of which is the annulment of the August 28, 
2012 Decision of the RTC of Laoag City granting the reconstitution of 
TCT T-34540, despite the fact that the first owner's duplicate copy 
thereof was never lost. Thus, the cancellation of the reconstituted 
title is only a necessary consequence of the annulment of the assailed 
August 28, 2012 Decision. Since the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT 
T-34540 is not in fact lost, the CA committed grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in not annulling the 
August 28, 2012 RTC Decision on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
[21]
 
 For their part, respondents counter that the instant petition for 
certiorari

 should be dismissed for being an improper remedy because the proper 
recourse to assail the dismissal of the Rule 47 petition filed with the 
CA is through a petition for review on
 certiorari 
under Rule 45 
of the Rules of Court, it being a continuation of the original action 
filed before the CA. Even if the Court treats the petition as one under 
Rule 45, it must still be dismissed for late filing and by reason of 
which, the assailed CA Decision and Resolution already attained 
finality. The instant case is devoid of highly exceptional circumstances
 as to warrant the invocation of liberal application of the rules. 
Finally, they aver that even assuming that a Rule 65 petition may be 
availed of, it must still fail since the CA committed no grave abuse of 
discretion in dismissing the petition for annulment of judgment filed 
therewith. 
 
Our Ruling


 The petition is meritorious. 
 Prefatorily, petitioner availed of the wrong mode of appeal when she filed before the Court a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 to assail the August 15, 2014 Decision and November 14, 2014 Resolution of the CA. A petition for 
certiorari

 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is a special civil action that may 
be resorted to only in the absence of appeal or any plain, speedy and 
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[22]
 In 
Mandy Commodities, Inc. v. The International Commercial Bank of China
,
[23]
 the Court held: 
  


 In 
Alba v. Court of Appeals
 and 
Linzag v. Court of Appeals
,
 it was held that a party aggrieved by the decision of the Court of 
Appeals in a petition filed with it for annulment of judgment, final 
order or resolution is not a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65, but rather an ordinary appeal under Rule 45 where only questions of law may be raised. A petition for 
certiorari

 is, like a petition for annulment, a remedy of last resort and must be 
availed of only when an appeal or any other adequate, plain or speedy 
remedy may no longer be pursued in the ordinary course of law. A remedy 
is said to be plain, speedy and adequate when it will promptly relieve 
the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment and the acts 
of the lower court or agency.
[24]
 




 In this case, the CA acted within its jurisdiction when it 
rendered the assailed August 15, 2014 Decision. The decision was a final
 judgment that disposed of the case in a manner leaving the court with 
nothing more to do. Accordingly, petitioner should have filed a petition
 for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45, not a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65, in this Court. 
 Nevertheless, We bear in mind that the acceptance of a petition for 
certiorari
, as well as the grant of due course thereto is, in general, addressed to the sound discretion of the Court.
[25]

 We recognize that although procedural rules ought to be strictly 
enforced by courts in order to impart stability in the legal system, We 
have, nonetheless, relaxed the rigid application of the rules of 
procedure in several cases to afford the parties the opportunity to 
fully ventilate their cases on the merits. This is because the ends of 
justice would be better served if the parties were given the chance to 
argue their causes and defenses. We are likewise constantly reminded 
that the general objective of procedure is to facilitate the application
 of justice to the opposing claims of the competing parties and always 
be guided by the principle that procedure must not hinder but, rather, 
promote the administration of justice.
[26]
 

 Thus, notwithstanding the foregoing procedural lapse committed by 
petitioner, in the interest of justice and to prevent further prolonging
 the proceedings in this case, the Court resolves to give due course to 
her petition and rule on the merits thereof.
[27]

 This is so especially considering that petitioner has presented a good 
cause for the proper and just determination of her case. 
 Under 
Section 2, Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, the only grounds for annulment
 of judgment are extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. In this case,
 petitioner alleges that the CA erred in failing to annul the Decision 
of the RTC on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. 
 Lack of 
jurisdiction as a ground for annulment of judgment refers to either lack
 of jurisdiction over the person of the defending party or over the 
subject matter of the claim. In case of absence, or lack, of 
jurisdiction, a court should not take cognizance of the case. Thus, the 
prevailing rule is that where there is want of jurisdiction over a 
subject matter, the judgment is rendered null and void. A void judgment 
is in legal effect no judgment, by which no rights are divested, from 
which no right can be obtained, which neither binds nor bars any one, 
and under which all acts performed and all claims flowing out are void. 
It is not a decision in contemplation of law and, hence, it can never 
become executory. It also follows that such a void judgment cannot 
constitute a bar to another case by reason of 
res judicata
.
[28]

 In this case, the Court finds that the CA erred in denying petitioner's
 petition for annulment of judgment holding that the same was a subtle 
experiment to collaterally dispute the owner's duplicate certificate of 
title which was issued in favor of Perlita in the reconstitution 
proceeding before the RTC. 
 In 
Spouses Ibias v. Macabeo
,
[29]
 citing 
Alonso v. Cebu Country Club, Inc
.
[30]
 the Court described reconstitution, thus: 
  


 The reconstitution of a title is simply the re-issuance of a 
lost duplicate certificate of title in its original form and condition. 
It does not determine or resolve the ownership of the land covered by 
the lost or destroyed title. A reconstituted title, like the original 
certificate of title, by itself does not vest ownership of the land or 
estate covered thereby.
[31]




 Verily, the reconstitution of a certificate of title denotes 
restoration in the original form and condition of a lost or destroyed 
instrument attesting the title of a person to a piece of land. The 
purpose of the reconstitution of title is to have, after observing the 
procedures prescribed by law, the title reproduced in exactly the same 
way it has been when the loss or destruction occurred.
[32]
 
 Section 109 of PD 1529
[33]
 provides for the procedure in case of loss of an owner's duplicate certificate of title: 
  


 Section 109. 
Notice and replacement of lost duplicate certificate
.
 â In case of loss or theft of an owner's duplicate certificate of 
title, due notice under oath shall be sent by the owner or by someone in
 his behalf to the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the 
land lies as soon as the loss or theft is discovered. If a duplicate 
certificate is lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced by a person 
applying for the entry of a new certificate to him or for the 
registration of any instrument, a sworn statement of the fact of such 
loss or destruction may be filed by the registered owner or other person
 in interest and registered. 


 Upon the petition of the registered owner or other person in 
interest, the court may, after notice and due hearing, direct the 
issuance of a new duplicate certificate, which shall contain a 
memorandum of the fact that it is issued in place of the lost duplicate 
certificate, but shall in all respects be entitled to like faith and 
credit as the original duplicate, and shall thereafter be regarded as 
such for all purposes of this decree. 




 From the foregoing, it appears that for an order of reconstitution
 to be issued, it must be clearly shown that the certificate of title 
had been lost or destroyed. If a certificate of title has not been lost,
 but is in fact in the possession of another person, then the 
reconstituted title is void and the court that rendered the decision had
 no jurisdiction.
[34]
 
Indubitably, the fact of loss or destruction of the owner's duplicate 
certificate of title is crucial in clothing the RTC with jurisdiction 
over the judicial reconstitution proceedings.
[35]
 As early as the case of 
Strait Times, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
,
[36]
 citing 
Serra Serra v. Court of Appeals
,
[37]
 the Court has held: 
  


 [T]hat if a certificate of title has not been lost, but is in 
fact in the possession of another person, then the reconstituted title 
is void and the court that rendered the decision had no jurisdiction. 
This was reiterated in 
Demetriou vs. Court of Appeals
 and 
New Durawood Co, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
.
 In the present case, it is undisputed that the allegedly lost owner's 
duplicate certificate of title was all the while in the possession of 
Atty. Iriarte, who even submitted it as evidence. Indeed, private 
respondent has not controverted the genuineness and authenticity of the 
said certificate of title. These unmistakably show that the trial court 
did not have jurisdiction to order the issuance of a new duplicate, and 
the certificate issued is itself void.
[38]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Similarly, in 
Spouses Paulino v. Court of Appeals
,
[39]

 the Court reiterated the rule that when the owner's duplicate 
certificate of title was not actually lost or destroyed, but is in fact 
in the possession of another person, the reconstituted title is void 
because the court that rendered the order of reconstitution had no 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. 
 The same ruling holds true in the case of 
Billote v. Solis
,
[40]

 where the Court pronounced that "since the owner's duplicate 
certificate of title has not been lost, but was in the possession of 
William, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the petition 
for the issuance of a new owner's duplicate certificate of title. Hence,
 the CA was correct in declaring the decision of the RTC as well as the 
second owner's duplicate certificate of title issued pursuant thereto a 
nullity. It is, therefore, the fact of the loss or existence of the 
owner's duplicate certificate, and not whether the process prescribed by
 applicable law was successfully complied with, that determines the 
presence or lack of jurisdiction of the trial court." 
 Otherwise 
stated, reconstitution presupposes the existence of an original 
certificate of title which was lost or destroyed. If there was no loss 
or destruction as in the case at bar, there is actually nothing to 
reconstitute. Here, petitioner clearly alleged in her petition before 
the CA that, contrary to the claim of Mary in the reconstitution 
proceeding, the owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540 was not really 
lost, as the same was surrendered to her by Timoteo and was in her 
possession all along. The alleged lost TCT was in fact offered in 
evidence by petitioner before the CA and private respondents did not 
contest the genuineness and authenticity of the same. Thus, with 
evidence that the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-34540 was 
not lost but was actually in the possession of another, the RTC decision
 was null and void for lack of jurisdiction. 
 That there was no 
valid contract of sale executed between Perlita and petitioner is of no 
moment. The indelible fact remains that the allegedly lost genuine 
certificate of title was all the while in the custody of petitioner. 
Ergo, the RTC did not validly acquire jurisdiction over the subject 
matter of the reconstitution proceeding. 
 In its ruling, the CA cited the case of 
The Heirs of the Late Sps. Luciano P. Lim v. The Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City
,
[41]
 (
Sps. Lim
)
 in declaring that a petition for annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of
 the Rules of Court cannot be used to attack the validity of the second 
owner's duplicate certificate of title issued in the reconstitution 
proceeding before the RTC, and that the proper remedy of petitioner is 
to file a direct action before the RTC for the cancellation of the 
reconstituted title. In short, the CA held that petitioner's resort to a
 Rule 47 petition before the CA to impugn the reconstituted title in 
favor of Perlita was incorrect. 
 We do not agree. 
 The CA's reliance in the 
Sps. Lim

 is utterly misplaced. In that case, the Court affirmed the CA's 
dismissal of the petition for annulment of judgment not because the said
 petition was a wrong recourse but because the petitioners therein were 
not real parties-in-interest to dispute the reconstitution of the 
original and duplicate copy of the TCT in dispute. The CA found that the
 property claimed by petitioners in 
Sps. Lim
 was entirely different and not even a part of the property covered by the reconstituted title. Thus, the Court held: 
  


 We reviewed the titles presented by both parties in the 
proceedings below and arrived at the same conclusion as that of the 
Court of Appeals. Indeed, per their TCT, petitioners' lot was derived 
from Lot-22-D-3, whereas respondent CaÃ±osa's covers the entire Lot 22-A.
 Simple logic dictates that Lot 22-A is different from Lot-22-D-3, and 
that Lot-22-D-3 could not have been in Lot 22-A. 


 
Petitioners are not real parties-in-interest because the 
reconstitution of the original and duplicate copy of TCT No. 169395 will
 have no effect on their property, the latter being different from, and 
not even a part of the property covered by the reconstituted title. 
One
 having no right or interest of his own to protect cannot invoke the 
jurisdiction of the court as a party plaintiff in an action, thus 
petitioners' petition for annulment of judgment was rightfully 
dismissed.
[42]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Since the property claimed by the petitioners in 
Sps. Lim
 
was entirely different, and was not even a part of the land covered by 
the certificate of title they sought to be annulled, the Court held that
 the petitioners therein did not have the standing to question the 
reconstituted title. 
 On the contrary, it is undisputed that the 
property covered by the reconstituted title in the instant case is the 
same property covered by the first owner's duplicate copy of TCT T-34540
 which petitioner presented in evidence before the CA and claimed to be 
in her possession since September 2009. Considering that the subject of 
the controversy herein involves the same property, the ruling of this 
Court in 
Sps. Lim
 is clearly not applicable in the instant case. 
 Moreover, in 
Sps. Lim
,
 the Court noted that both parties raised issues of ownership and 
spuriousness of their respective titles. Thus, the Court stressed the 
well-entrenched rule that a certificate of title cannot be subject to 
collateral attack and can be altered, modified or cancelled only in a 
direct proceeding in accordance with law. Simply put, the Court ruled 
that a certificate of title cannot be collaterally attacked in a 
petition for annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, 
thus: 
  


 However, the Court of Appeals noted that both parties raised 
issues of ownership and spuriousness of their respective titles - with 
petitioners claiming that no records exist in the Quezon City Assessor's
 Office nor in the Taxation (Real Estate Division) of the ownership of 
respondent CaÃ±osa's predecessor-in-interest over a 33,914 sq. m. land in
 Quezon City, and with respondent CaÃ±osa asserting that the title issued
 to petitioners' predecessors-in-interest is a spurious, having emanated
 from a spurious private subdivision survey (Psd) plan. Obviously, the 
validity of the parties' respective titles is being attacked, in a 
proceeding which was brought merely to seek the nullification of an 
order of reconstitution. This cannot be allowed. It is a well-settled 
doctrine that a certificate of title cannot be subject to collateral 
attack and can be altered, modified or cancelled only in a direct 
proceeding in accordance with law. This is the very same reason why the 
Court of Appeals could not, and did not deign to, resolve the matter of 
ownership. The Court of Appeals' declaration that it is not a trier of 
facts must be taken within this context.
[43]
 




 In contrast, it bears stressing that the parties in the instant 
case did not impugn their respective titles to the property in question.
 An examination of the petition for annulment of judgment before the CA 
reveals that petitioner never questioned Perlita's ownership of the 
subject property. In fact, petitioner acknowledged Perlita's ownership 
thereof. Neither did respondents Perlita and Mary in any way challenge 
the genuineness and authenticity of the first owner's duplicate copy of 
TCT T-34540 submitted by petitioner. To stress, what petitioner sought 
in her Rule 47 petition with the CA was the annulment of the RTC 
Decision reconstituting TCT T-34540, on the ground that the first 
owner's duplicate copy thereof was never lost but was in fact in her 
possession all along. Petitioner only needed to show the fact that the 
owner's duplicate copy was not, in truth, missing in order to determine 
the lack of jurisdiction of the trial court resulting in the annulment 
of judgment thereof. The CA's application of the ruling of the Court in 
Sps. Lim
 is, therefore, plainly misplaced in view of its factual variance with the case at bar.
