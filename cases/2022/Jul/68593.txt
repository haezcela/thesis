Proceedings before the Trial Court
On October 3, 2013, respondents
[12]
 Rural Sugar Planters' Association, Inc., Northern Negros Planters Association, Inc., Confederation of Sugar Producers Associations, Inc., United Sugar Producers Federation of the Philippines, Inc. and NFSP, Inc. initiated a petition for declaratory relief
[13]
 to declare as unconstitutional RR 13-2013. They asserted that: (1) RR No. 13-2013 violates the due process clause
[14]
 since its issuance was not preceded by notice, hearing, and publication, (2) They also claimed that the definition of raw sugar as ordained by RR 13-2013 violates the rule on uniformity of taxation
[15]
 and goes against the intent of par. 2, Section 109(1)(A),
[16]
 National Internal Revenue Code (
NIRC
), as amended, as well as the technical meaning of raw sugar as commonly understood in the industry, and as borne in the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines and the old RR 13-2008.
The case was docketed as SCA No. 88-C and got raffled to the RTCÂ­Branch 60, Cadiz City. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order (
TRO
) for seventy-two (72) hours under Order dated October 3, 2013.
[17]
A summary hearing on the TRO followed, after which, on October 7, 2013 or two (2) days before the effectivity of the RR 13-2013 (October 9, 2013), the duration of the TRO was extended to seventeen (17) days or until October 23, 2013.
[18]
On October 9, 2013, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Urgent Motion for Dissolution of TRO, arguing that the twenty (20) day TRO should have been outrightly denied as respondents allegedly failed: (1) to comply with the notice requirement for filing an application for a writ of preliminary injunction; (2) to provide them (petitioners) complete copies of the petition; and (3) to demonstrate that they have an unmistakable right and will stand to suffer a great or irreparable injury should the TRO be denied. Shortly thereafter, petitioners also filed an Urgent Motion for Early Resolution dated October 14, 2013.
[19]
In their Comment/Opposition dated October 17, 2013 to the motion for reconsideration, respondents pointed out that: (a) petitioners actively participated in the hearing for injunction. Though the notice of hearing was defective, the fact that the trial court took cognizance thereof cured any defect therein; (b) petitioners' receipt of an incomplete copy of the petition was merely a result of inadvertence; and (c) the implementation of RR 13-2013 will subject them (respondents) to VAT.
[20]
Petitioners then filed an Urgent Motion to Dissolve TRO and Opposition to the Application for Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated October 18, 2013,
[21]
 arguing that: (1) there is no more TRO to be extended as it had already expired; (2) under Section 218
[22]
 of the NIRC of 1997, there is a "no injunction" rule against tax collection; and (3) respondents failed to establish a right in 
esse
 to the injunctive relief prayed for.
The Ruling of the Trial Court
By Consolidated Order dated October 22, 2013,
[23]
 the trial court granted the Writ of Preliminary Injunction against the implementation of RR 13-2013 and required respondents to procure a corresponding surety bond equivalent to P1,000,000.00.
The trial court ruled that the verified petition is sufficient in form and substance in accordance with Section 6, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.
[24]
 Without the writ of preliminary injunction, respondents will suffer serious and irreparable injury and damage from the implementation of RR 13-2013. Too, if not enjoined, the same will cause injustice to the respondents as the immediate threat of implementation on October 9, 2013 may render the judgment ineffectual.
Consequently, under Order dated October 23, 2013,
[25]
 the trial court approved the surety bond procured by respondents in the amount of P1,000,000.00. On the same day, the trial court issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction,
[26]
 enjoining petitioners from implementing RR 13-2013 and preserving the 
status quo ante bellum
 pending determination of the case on the merits.
Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was denied under Order
[27]
 dated January 14, 2014.
The Present Petition
Petitioners, through the Office of the Solicitor General (
OSG
), charged the trial court with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction for issuing the writ of preliminary injunction. They invoked the following grounds: (1) Section 218, NIRC, as amended, explicitly prohibits the issuance of a writ of injunction against collection of taxes; (2) the issuance of the writ of injunction would, in effect, dispose of the main case without trial; (2) the writ of injunction was issued despite respondents' utter failure to prove the essential requisites for its issuance; (3) the amount of surety bond required and posted is grossly inadequate to the extent of damage to be suffered by the government in terms of lost revenues; (4) the TRO should not have been extended for 17 days as the original TRO had already expired; and (5) the writ of injunction was issued not only against Regional Director of BIR Region XII Perfecto L. Aranas, but also against DoF Sec. Purisima and CIR Henares who all hold office outside the trial court's territorial jurisdiction in violation of Section 21(1), Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,
[28]
 as amended.
In their Comment dated September 28, 2014,
[29]
 respondents riposted that: (a) the "no injunction rule" only lies against collection of taxes. Here, what is being restrained is the imposition, not the collection, of taxes. More, though the effect of injunction is to hold the implementation of RR 13-2013 in abeyance, petitioners still retain the right to make a tax assessment within three (3) years;
[30]
 (b) the essential requisites for the issuance of a writ of injunction were complied with;
[31]
 (c) petitioners should have established the extent of damage it will allegedly suffer before it can truly claim that the surety bond posted is grossly inadequate;
[32]
 and (d) when the trial court enjoined the other parties from implementing RR 13-2013, the same is only effective as far as the trial court's territorial jurisdiction goes.
[33]
In its Reply dated November 24, 2014,
[34]
 petitioners claimed that the issuance of the writ of injunction will cause it to lose over three (3) billion pesos in VAT collections.
[35]
Meantime, respondents filed a Manifestation dated June 8, 2015,
[36]
 informing the Court that on May 22, 2015, DoF Sec. Purisima, upon the recommendation of CIR Henares, issued RR 8-2015, amending RR 13-2008 insofar as the definition of raw sugar is concerned, 
viz.
:
Section 2. Definition of Terms. - For purposes of these Regulations the following terms shall have the following meaning:
(a) Raw Cane Sugar - the natural sugar extracted from sugarcane through simple mechanical process by pressing for the juice; boiled to crystallize; filtered using centrifuge to separate these crystals, and dried, resulting to crystallize brown sugar (brown color due to natural molasses content present in sugar cane): 
Provided
, that it shall refer to raw cane sugar produced from conducting only one (1) stage of filtering and centrifugal without any other further process applied thereto, such as but not limited to washing, bleaching, etc.: 
Provided further
, that its color is greater than 800 ICU and that its content of sucrose by weight in dry state corresponds to a polarimeter reading of less than 99.5Â°.
The above definition includes muscovado which has standard specifications as produced, namely: Powder Class A â polarization of 86Â° minimum; Powder Class B â polarization of 77Â° minimum; and, Lump â polarization of 57Â° minimum.
Thus, only those falling under the above-definition of Raw Cane Sugar, including muscovado, are exempt from VAT, or from Percentage Tax, pursuant to Section 109 (1)(A) of the Tax Code.
The Sugar Regulatory Authority represents that it collects on a biweekly basis composite samples from mills for routine quality tests. For further verification that the products produced by mills conform to the definition contained herein, the SRA shall provide the BIR with a copy of the results of said test showing the polarimeter and color reading of the Raw Cane Sugar produced, within 15 days from the end of the calendar month. The SRA shall also insure that they have in place rules and regulations requiring the "RAW CANE SUGAR" be clearly placed on quedans issued for products falling under this definition.
(b) Sugar - refers to sugar other than Raw Cane Sugar as defined in the preceding paragraph. This includes sugar whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state corresponds to a polarimeter reading of 99.5Â° and above and/or whose color is 800 ICU or less.
Cane Sugar produced from the following shall be presumed, for internal revenue purposes, to be refined sugar: 
 
(1)
product of a refining process,
(2)
products of a Sugar Refinery, or
(3)
 
product of a production line of a sugar mill accredited by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (Bureau or BIR may be used interchangeably in these regulations) to be producing and/or capable of producing sugar with polarimeter reading of 99.5Â° and above, and for which the 
quedan
 issued therefor as verified by the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) identifies the sugar to be of a polarimeter reading of 99.5Â° and above.
Nonetheless, sugar produced from sugar production lines accredited by the Bureau to be capable of producing sugar with polarimeter reading of 99.5Â° or above shall be prima facie presumed to be refined sugar.
[37]
 (Emphases supplied)
x x x x
In their Compliance dated May 14, 2021, petitioners confirmed the issuance of RR 8-2015, which has the consequent effect of restoring the VAT exempt status of raw sugar.
[38]
 They asserted though that the real core issue pertains to the "no injunction rule," which the lower courts should apply insofar as collection of taxes is concerned.
Our Ruling
The petition is DISMISSED on the ground of mootness.
Oclarino v. Navarro
[39]
 is 
apropos
:
The existence of an actual case or controversy is a condition precedent for the court's exercise of its power of adjudication. An actual case or controversy exists when there is a conflict of legal rights or an assertion of opposite legal claims between the parties that is susceptible or ripe for judicial resolution. On the other hand, 
a moot and academic case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical value
. As a rule, courts decline jurisdiction over such a case, or dismiss it on ground of mootness; otherwise, the court would engage in rendering an advisory opinion on what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.
A case becomes moot and academic when tire conflicting issue that may be resolved by the court ceases to exist as a result of supervening events.
 While it is true that this Court may assume jurisdiction over a case that has been rendered moot and academic by supervening events, the following instances must be present: 
(1)
Grave constitutional violations;
(2)
Exceptional character of the case;
(3)
Paramount public interest;
(4)
The case presents an opportunity to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; or
(5)
The case is capable of repetition yet evading review. (Emphases and italics supplied)
[40]
x x x x
RR 8-2015 restored the VAT exempt status of raw sugar previously withdrawn under the subject RR 13-2013. Surely, this development is a supervening event which renders the main action for declaratory relief against the constitutionality of the old RR 13-2013 academic. Petitioners do not refute this. Where the main action has become academic, so have the ancillary relief for TRO or writ of injunction and all related incidents, including petitioners' opposition to its issuance and the present petition seeking to nullify the writ of injunction issued by the trial court.
For petitioners to insist on the resolution of how the "no injunction rule" was supposedly violated when the trial court issued the assailed writ of injunction is actually asking the Court to render an advisory opinion, resolve a hypothetical or feigned problem, or a mere academic answer, which is beyond the Court's power of review, thus:
[41]
The power of judicial review is limited to actual cases or controversies. 
Courts decline to issue advisory opinions or to resolve hypothetical or feigned problems, or mere academic questions.
 The limitation of the power of judicial review to actual cases and controversies defines the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power, to assure that the courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government.
An actual case or controversy involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims, susceptible of judicial resolution as distinguished from a hypothetical or abstract difference or dispute. There must be a contrariety of legal rights that can be interpreted and enforced on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence. The Court can decide the constitutionality of an act or treaty only when a proper case between opposing parties is submitted for judicial determination. (Emphases and italics supplied)
[42]
x x x x
Besides, the injunctive writ, together with petitioners' opposition, and petition for 
certiorari
 relative thereto are a mere adjunct to the main case for declaratory relief. Since the main case has already become academic, the ancillary relief and all incidents related thereto necessarily have become academic, as well. For the spring cannot rise above its source.
[43]
So must it be.
ACCORDINGLY
, the petition is 
DISMISSED
 on the ground of mootness.
SO ORDERED.

Grounds for objection to, or for motion of dissolution of, injunction or restraining order. - The application for injunction or restraining order may be denied, upon a showing of its insufficiency. The injunction or restraining order may also be denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved, on other grounds upon affidavits of the party or person enjoined, which may be opposed by the applicant also by affidavits. It may further be denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved, if it appears after hearing that although the applicant is entitled to the injunction or restraining order, the issuance or continuance thereof, as the case may be, would cause irreparable damage to the party or person enjoined while the applicant can be fully compensated for such damages as he may suffer, and the former files a bond in an amount fixed by the court conditioned that he will pay all damages which the applicant may suffer by the denial or the dissolution of the injunction or restraining order. If it appears that the extent of the preliminary injunction or restraining order granted is too great, it may be modified. (6a)
