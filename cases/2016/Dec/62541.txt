RICARDO DEL POSO Y DELA CERNA, PETITIONER V. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT. 
DECISION




PERALTA, J.:


This is to resolve the Petition for Review on 
Certiorari

 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court dated January 28, 2014 of 
petitioner Ricardo Del Poso y Dela Cerna seeking the reversal of the 
Decision
[1]
 dated July 22, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
), which affirmed the Decision
[2]
 dated July 1, 2011 of the Regional Trial Court (
RTC
), Branch 38, Manila in Criminal Case No. 05-239429 convicting petitioner of violation of Section 10 (a) of Republic Act (
R.A
.) No. 7610.
  
 The facts follow.
  
 The victim, VVV
[3]
 
was given by her biological mother to the petitioner when she was 7 
years old and the latter then acted as her guardian. On September 10, 
2005, when VVV was 9 years old, petitioner ordered her to 	attend 	to 	
petitioner's 	photocopying	business. 	While 	attending the business, VVV
 fell asleep. When petitioner saw VVV asleep, the former became furious 
and laid VVV on top of an ironing board and placed a heated flat iron on
 her. When VVV tried to evade the heat emanating from the flat iron, her
 forehead, right elbow, left cheek, left buttock and back got burned. 
Thereafter, petitioner got her down from the ironing board and ordered 
her to sleep. The following morning, petitioner's wife saw the burns on 
VVV and told petitioner not to do it again. Later on, VVV went to her 
Lola Ma. Luisa to watch TV and the latter, and several other people, saw
 the burns prompting Lola Ma. Luisa to bring VVV to the Barangay Hall 
where the incident was put on blotter. Thereafter, VVV was brought to 
the hospital and then to the police station. 	Hence, an Information was 
filed against petitioner, which reads as follows:
  


 That on or about September 10, 2005, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, the said accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, 
and knowingly commit cruelty and abusive acts upon VVV, a minor, 9 years
 old, by then and there injuring the said minor on the forehead, right 
cheek, abdomen and at her right forearm with a hot flat iron, inflicting
 upon her multiple 1
st
 degree burns, which debases and 
demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of said VVV as a human being, an
 act prejudicial to her normal growth and development, to her damage and
 prejudice.


 Contrary to law.




 The prosecution presented seven (7) witnesses, namely: Anielyn 
Barnes, the Social Worker-on-case; SPO2 Susan Mendez of Station VI, the 
investigator; Redentor Torres, a Barangay Kagawad; VVV, herself; Laura 
Delos Santos, Records Custodian of the Ospital ng Maynila; Nanette 
Repalpa, a social worker who took custody of the victim; and Dr. Martin 
Joseph Cabahog. VVV, during her testimony, also narrated the other acts 
of physical abuse that petitioner had inflicted on her prior to the 
incident which became the basis of the present case.
 Petitioner, 
on the other hand, claimed that the incident happened accidentally. 
According to him, on that particular day, he just came from work when he
 saw VVV playing under a table and to teach her a lesson, he tried to 
scare her with a hot flat iron. Petitioner was then not aware that VVV 
was hurt as there were no marks on her. The marks only became evident 
the following morning. Petitioner claimed that he applied medication on 
VVV's burns.
 The RTC found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of violation of Section 10 (a) of R.A No. 7610 in its Decision 
dated July 1, 2011, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds that the 
prosecution has proven the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt 
from the crime of violation of Section 10 (a) of RA 7610, "The Special 
Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and 
Discrimination Act" and hereby sentences Ricardo Del Poso y Cerna to 
suffer the penalty of four (4) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) 
days of 
prision correccional,
 as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as maximum.


 SO ORDERED.




 Petitioner filed his appeal with the CA and the latter court, in 
its Decision dated July 22, 2013, dismissed the same appeal and affirmed
 the Decision of the RTC, the dispositive portion of which reads:
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal filed by appellant is
 hereby DENIED. The Decision dated 1 July 2011 and Order dated 27 
October 2011 RTC, (NCJR) Branch 38, Manila in Crim. Case No. 05-239429 
are AFFIRMED.


 SO ORDERED.
[4]




 Hence, the present petition.
 The grounds relied upon by petitioner are the following:
  
	THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN CONVICTING THE 
PETITIONER WHEN THE MINOR CHILD-COMPLAINANT ADMITTED THAT SHE SUSTAINED 
THE BURNS WHEN SHE TRIED TO EVADE THE HEATED IRON THAT (PETITIONER) WAS 
HOLDING OVER HER WHILE LYING ON THE IRONING BOARD JUST TO SCARE HER AS A
 WAY OF CHASTENING HER, WHICH THE COURT FOUND IN ITS ASSAILED DECISION. 
[EQUALLY] OF WEIGHT, WHICH IT LIKEWISE FOUND AND WHICH IT 
UNCEREMONIOUSLY DISREGARDED IS THE RELATION OF THE PARTIES ESTABLISHED 
BY FATE. 


ASSUMING THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS IS CORRECT, IT ERRED 
WHEN IT REFUSED TO APPRECIATE IN FAVOR 	OF 	THE 	PETITIONER 	THE 	
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF NO INTENTION TO COMMIT SO GRAVE A WRONG AS 
THAT COMMITTED DESPITE THE PARALLEL CASE OF PEOPLE V. ENRIQUEZ, 58 PHIL.
 536 IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THAT TO BE PRESENT, PASSION AND OBFUSCATION 
AND SUCH OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ANALOGOUS THERETO. 


 HENCE, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT MODIFYING THE SENTENCE OF THE PETITIONER TO ONE DEGREE LOWER.
[5]


 Petitioner insists that the CA erred in convicting him when the 
minor admitted that she sustained the burns when she tried to evade the 
heated iron that he was holding over her while lying on the ironing 
board just to scare her as a way of chastening her. He also claims that 
assuming the CA is correct, it still erred in refusing to appreciate the
 mitigating circumstances of no intention to commit so grave a wrong as 
that committed and passion and/or obfuscation, thus, also erring in not 
modifying his sentence to another degree lower.
 The Office of the Solicitor General (
OSG
), in its Comment
[6]

 dated June 19, 2014, argues that the trial court and the CA correctly 
convicted the petitioner for violation of R.A. No. 7610. It also avers 
that the trial court correctly denied appreciation of the mitigating 
circumstances of passion and/or obfuscation and lack of intention to 
commit so grave a wrong, and as such properly applied the corresponding 
penalty without any mitigating circumstance.
 In its Reply
[7]
 dated October 8, 2014, petitioner reiterates the arguments and issues he presented in his petition.
 The petition is unmeritorious.
 Under Rule 45, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised in a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
:
  


 Section 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court. - A party 
desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment, final order or 
resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax 
Appeals, the Regional Trial Court or other courts, whenever authorized 
by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review 
on certiorari. The petition may include an application for a writ of 
preliminary injunction or other provisional remedies and shall raise 
only questions of law, which must be distinctly set forth. The 
petitioner may seek the same  provisional remedies by verified motion 
filed in the same action or proceeding at any time during its pendency.




 As an exception to the rule, questions of fact may be raised in a Rule 45 Petition if any of the following is present:
  


 (1) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (2) when the 
findings are grounded on speculations; (3) when the inference made is 
manifestly mistaken; (4) when the judgment of the Court of Appeals is 
based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the factual findings are 
conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the
 case and its findings are contrary to the admissions of the parties; 
(7) when the Court of Appeals overlooked undisputed facts which, if 
properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; (8) when the 
findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial 
court; (9) when the facts set forth by the petitioner are not disputed 
by the respondent; and (10) when the findings of the Court of Appeals 
are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the 
evidence on record.
[8]




 A question of fact exists "when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged facts."
[9]

 On the other hand, a question of law exists "when the doubt or 
difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts."
[10]

 A close reading of the issues presented by petitioner shows that they 
are all factual in nature, and thus, does not fall within the scope of a
 petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court nor do they 
fall within the exceptions to the general rule.
 Nevertheless, even if this Court should disregard such infirmity, the petition still fails to impress.

 Section 10 of R.A. No. 7610 otherwise known as "An Act Providing for 
Stronger Deterrence and Special Protection Against Child Abuse, 
Exploitation and Discrimination, and for Other Purposes," provides the 
following:
 ARTICLE VI 

    Other Acts of Abuse
  


 SECTION 10. Other Acts 	of Neglect,	Abuse, 	Cruelty 	or 
Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's 
Development. - 








(a)


Any person who shall 
commit any other acts of child abuse, cruelty or exploitation or be 
responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development 
including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as
 amended, but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall 
suffer the penalty of prision mayor in its minimum period.








Section 3 of the same law defines child abuse as -


 3 (b) "Child abuse" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following:




(1) Psychological and
 physical abuse
, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment; 

      (2) 
Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.






 The prosecution was able to prove the elements of the violation of
 the said law, namely: (1) the minority of VVV; (2) the acts 
constituting physical abuse, committed by petitioner against VVV; and 
(3) the said acts are clearly punishable under R.A. No. 7610. As aptly 
ruled by the CA citing the factual findings of the RTC, all the elements
 of the crime charged are present, thus:
  


 We agree with the trial court when it ruled that the prosecution
 have established the elements of child abuse in this case, to wit: (a) 
the victim's minority; (b) the acts constituting physical and 
psychological abuse when accused employed the use of a heated flat iron;
 and (c) said excessive acts of rebuke and chastening are clearly 
punishable under RA No. 7610. This is clearly shown in the evidence it 
presented during trial particularly the testimonies of its witnesses and
 that of the minor victim, VVV, who gave a clear, consistent, and 
credible account of the events on September 10, 2010, in a 
straightforward and candid manner. Settled is the rule that when the 
victim's testimony is straightforward, convincing, and consistent with 
human nature and the normal course of things, unflawed by any material 
or significant inconsistency, it passes the test of credibility, and the
 accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof. Hence, We see no 
reason not to affirm the factual findings of the trial court. Equally, 
settled is the rule that factual findings of the trial court are 
entitled to respect and are not to be disturbed on appeal, unless some 
facts or circumstances of weight and substance, having been overlooked 
or misinterpreted, might materially affect the disposition of the case. 
Not one of the exceptions is present in this case.
[11]




 In 
Araneta v. People
,
[12]
 this Court discussed the nature of the crime of child abuse as defined in R.A. No. 7610, thus:
  


 Republic Act No. 7610 is a measure geared towards the 
implementation of a national comprehensive program for the survival of 
the most vulnerable members of the population, the Filipino children, in
 keeping with the Constitutional mandate under Article XV, Section 3, 
paragraph 2, that 
The State shall defend the right of the 
children to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special
 protection from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and
 other conditions prejudicial to their development.
 This piece 
of legislation supplies the inadequacies of existing laws treating 
crimes committed against children, namely, the Revised Penal Code and 
Presidential Decree No. 603 or the Child and Youth Welfare Code. As a 
statute that provides for a mechanism for strong deterrence against the 
commission of child abuse and exploitation, the law has stiffer 
penalties for their commission, and a means by which child traffickers 
could easily be prosecuted and penalized. Also, the definition of child 
abuse is expanded to encompass not only those specific acts of child 
abuse under existing laws but includes also other acts of neglect, 
abuse, cruelty or exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to the 
child's development.


 Article VI of the statute enumerates the other acts of abuse. Paragraph (a) of Section 10 thereof states:




 Article VI
 
  OTHER ACTS OF ABUSE
  




 SEC. 10. Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Childs Development.


 (a) Any person who shall commit 
any other acts of abuse, cruelty or exploitation or be responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development

 including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, 
as amended, but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall
 suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor 
in its minimum period.




 As gleaned from the foregoing, the provision punishes not only 
those enumerated under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, but 
also four distinct acts, 
i.e
., (a) child abuse, (b) child 
cruelty, (c) child exploitation and (d) being responsible for conditions
 prejudicial to the child's development. The Rules and Regulations of 
the questioned statute distinctly and separately defined child abuse, 
cruelty and exploitation just to show that these three acts are 
different from one another and from the act prejudicial to the child's 
development. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, an accused can be 
prosecuted and be convicted under Section 10(a), Article VI of Republic 
Act No. 7610 if he commits any of the four acts therein. The prosecution
 need not prove that the acts of child abuse, child cruelty and child 
exploitation have resulted in the prejudice of the  child because an act
 prejudicial to the development of the child is different from the 
former acts.


 Moreover, it is a rule in statutory construction that the word 
or is a disjunctive term signifying dissociation and independence of one
 thing from other things enumerated. It should, as a rule, be construed 
in the sense which it ordinarily implies. Hence, the use of or in 
Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 before the phrase be responsible 
for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development supposes 
that there are four punishable acts therein. First, the act of child 
abuse; second, child cruelty; third, child exploitation; and fourth, 
being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development.
 The fourth penalized act cannot be interpreted, as petitioner suggests,
 as a qualifying condition for the three other acts, because an analysis
 of the entire context of the questioned provision does not warrant such
 construal.


 The subject statute defines children as persons below eighteen 
(18) years of age; or those over that age but are unable to fully take 
care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, 
exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental 
disability or condition.
[13]




 As to the contention of petitioner that the mitigating 
circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong should have
 been appreciated, this Court finds it unmeritorious. It is a hornbook 
doctrine that this mitigating circumstance can be taken into account 
only when the facts proven show that there is a notable and evident 
disproportion between the means employed to execute the criminal act and
 its consequences.
[14]
 The 
facts found by the trial court and the CA show that petitioner intended 
the natural consequence of his act. The observation of the OSG that 
petitioner's intention of inflicting such harm should be judged in 
accordance with his previous acts of abusing the victim, of regarding 
VVV as a mere adoptive child who is not his blood relative and 
petitioner's evident superiority of physique as a fully grown man 
inflicting harm upon a 9-year-old victim, and thus, when petitioner 
pressed the hot iron upon the body of the victim, it must be presumed 
that his intention was to physically abuse her since such act was 
sufficient to produce the evil which resulted from such act is also 
worth noting.
[15]
 
Applying the same set of facts, petitioner is also not entitled to the 
application of the mitigating circumstance of passion and/or 
obfuscation. The mitigating circumstance of passion or obfuscation only 
applies if the act of the victim is both unlawful and sufficient to 
produce such condition of mind.
[16]

 A child who fell asleep while attending to a business establishment is 
not an offense at all and could not give rise to an impulse sufficiently
 powerful to naturally produce a justified diminution of an adult's 
selfÂ­control. As correctly ruled by the CA:
  


 Going now to the theory of appellant that the trial court 
committed error when it did not appreciate the mitigating circumstances 
of passion and/or obfuscation and lack of intent to commit so grave a 
wrong, the same deserves scant consideration.


 To be entitled to the mitigating circumstance [of] passion 
and/or obfuscation the following elements must be present: (1) there 
should be an act both unlawful and sufficient to produce such condition 
of mind; (2) the act that produced the obfuscation was not far removed 
from the commission of the crime by a considerable length of time, 
during which the perpetrator might recover his normal equanimity. These 
elements are not present here. There was no unlawful and sufficient act 
on VVV's part which sufficiently provoked passion and/or obfuscation on 
appellant's side. As correctly observed by the trial court, the dozing 
off of VVV when she was ordered to watch over the Xerox machine for 
possible clients is not an unlawful act sufficient to produce passion 
and raging anger, even to a disciplinarian foster parent. Hence, 
appellant cannot successfully claim that he was blinded by passion and 
obfuscation.
[17]




 Hence, the trial court and the CA correctly imposed the penalty by
 not considering the mitigating circumstances claimed by petitioner. 
Section 10 (a) of R.A. No. 7610 imposes the penalty of 
prision mayor

 in its minimum period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the 
trial court did not err when it imposed the penalty of 4 years, 9 months
 and 11 days of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to 6 years, 8 months and 1 day of 
prision mayor
, as maximum.
  
 
WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 dated January 28, 2014 of Ricardo Del Poso y Dela Cerna is 
DENIED 
for
 lack merit and the Decision dated July 22, 2013, dismissing 
petitioner's appeal and affirming the Decision dated July 1, 2011 of the
 Regional Trial Court, Branch 38, Manila in Criminal Case No. 05-239429,

and imposing upon petitioner the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment
