R E S O L U T I O N




JARDELEZA, J.:


On August 5, 2015, the Court rendered a Decision granting petitioners Jose Toledo, Glenn Padiernos and Danilo Padiernos' petition for review on certiorari. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, we 
GRANT
 the petition and 
SET ASIDE
 the assailed 
Decision
 and 
Resolution
 of the Court of Appeals dated October 22, 2004 and April 13, 2005, respectively, in CA G.R. SP No. 73670. Judgment is hereby rendered declaring petitioners the owners of Lot 4, Block 2, Ilang-Ilang Street, Sunrise Hills Subdivision, Quezon City presently covered by Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. RT-17876/(242918). The Register of Deeds of Quezon City is hereby ordered to:
(a) 
CANCEL
 TCT No. RT-17876 (242918) in the name of ARC Marketing Corporation; and
(b) 
ISSUE
 a Transfer Certificate of Title in the name of petitioners Jose V. Toledo, Glenn Padiernos and Danilo Padiemos.
SO ORDERED.
[1]
On October 1, 2015, a motion was filed seeking for the reconsideration of this Court's Decision.
[2]
 Since this case involved a determination of the correctness of the trial court's Order dated June 17, 2002 granting its motion to dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-30738,
[3]
 respondent ARC Marketing Corporation (ARC Marketing) posits that a reversal of such grant would consequently cause only a remand of the case to the court of origin.
[4]
Indeed, in addition to resolving the matter of the dismissal of Civil Case No. Q-97-30738, the Court, to prevent undue hardship on the parties and on the basis of the records before it, did decide the issue of ownership of the disputed property.
[5]
 On reconsideration, however, we agree that the issue of whether ARC Marketing is a buyer in good faith involves a factual issue the determination of which cannot be made by the Court in a petition for review filed under Rule 45.
[6]
 While the foregoing rule admits of certain exceptions,
[7]
 none appears to be invoked in this case. Thus, ARC Marketing's motion is 
GRANTED
 and the case is remanded to the court of origin for trial on the merits, where the concerned parties may present evidence to prove their respective claims and defenses. Accordingly, the dispositive portion of the Decision is 
MODIFIED
 as follows:
WHEREFORE
, we 
GRANT
 the petition and 
SET ASIDE
 the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated October 22, 2004 and April 13, 2005, respectively, in CA G.R. SP No. 73670. 
Civil Case No. Q-97-30738 is 
REMANDED
 to the court of origin which is 
DIRECTED
 to resolve the case with dispatch
.
SO ORDERED.
Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Reyes
, and 
Perez, JJ.
