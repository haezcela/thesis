SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 215957, November 09, 2016 ]


COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. FITNESS BY DESIGN, INC., RESPONDENT.
DECISION




LEONEN, J.:


To avail of the extraordinary period of assessment in Section 222(a) of the National Internal Revenue Code, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue should show that the facts upon which the fraud is based is communicated to the taxpayer. The burden of proving that the facts exist in any subsequent proceeding is with the Commissioner. Furthermore, the Final Assessment Notice is not valid if it does not contain a definite due date for payment by the taxpayer.
This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[1]
 filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, which assails the Decision
[2]
 dated July 14, 2014 and Resolution
[3]
 dated December 16, 2014 of the Court of Tax Appeals. The Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 affirmed the Decision of the First Division, which declared the assessment issued against Fitness by Design, Inc. (Fitness) as invalid.
[4]
On April 11, 1996, Fitness filed its Annul Income Tax Return for the taxable year of 1995.
[5]
 According to Fitness, it was still in its pre-operating stage during the covered period.
[6]
On June 9, 2004, Fitness received a copy of the Final Assessment Notice dated March 17, 2004.
[7]
 The Final Assessment Notice was issued under Letter of Authority No. 00002953.
[8]
 The Final Assessment Notice assessed that Fitness had a tax deficiency in the amount of P10,647,529.69.
[9]
 It provides:

 (Emphasis in the original)
Fitness filed a protest to the Final Assessment Notice on June 25, 2004. According to Fitness, the Commissioner's period to assess had already prescribed. Further, the assessment was without basis since the company was only incorporated on May 30, 1995.
[11]
On February 2, 2005, the Commissioner issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy with Reference No. OCN WDL-95-05-005 dated February 1, 2005 to Fitness.
[12]
Fitness filed before the First Division of the Court of Tax Appeals a Petition for Review (With Motion to Suspend Collection of Income Tax, Value Added Tax, Documentary Stamp Tax and Surcharges and Interests) on March 1, 2005.
[13]
On May 17, 2005, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed an Answer to Fitness' Petition and raised special and affirmative defenses.
[14]
 The Commissioner posited that the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy was issued in accordance with law.
[15]
 The Commissioner claimed that its right to assess had not yet prescribed under Section 222(a)
[16]
 of the National Internal Revenue Code.
[17]
 Because the 1995 Income Tax Return filed by Fitness was false and fraudulent for its alleged intentional failure to reflect its true sales, Fitness' respective taxes may be assessed at any time within 10 years from the discovery of fraud or omission.
[18]
The Commissioner asserted further that the assessment already became final and executory for Fitness' failure to file a protest within the reglementary period.
[19]
 The Commissioner denied that there was a protest to the Final Assessment Notice filed by Fitness on June 25, 2004.
[20]
 According to the Commissioner, the alleged protest was "nowhere to be found in the [Bureau of Internal Revenue] Records nor reflected in the Record Book of the Legal Division as normally done by [itsr receiving clerk when she received [sic] any document."
[21]
 Therefore, the Commissioner had sufficient basis to collect the tax deficiency through the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy.
[22]
The alleged fraudulent return was discovered through a tip from a confidential informant.
[23]
 The revenue officers' investigation revealed that Fitness had been operating business with sales operations amounting to P7,156,336.08 in 1995, which it neglected tq report in its income tax return.
[24]
 Fitness' failure to report its income resulted in deficiencies to its income tax and value-added tax of P8,265,568.17 and P2,377,274.02 respectively, as well as the documentary stamp tax with regard to capital stock subscription.
[25]
Through the report, the revenue officers recommended the filing of a civil case for collection of taxes and a criminal case for failure to declare Fitness' purported sales in its 1995 Income Tax Return.
[26]
 Hence, a criminal complaint against Fitness was filed before the Department of Justice.
[27]
The Court of Tax Appeals First Division granted Fitness' Petition on the ground that the assessment has already prescribed.
[28]
 It cancelled and set aside the Final Assessment Notice dated March 17, 2004 as well as the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy issued by the C mmissioner.
[29]
 It ruled that the Final Assessment Notice is invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 228
[30]
 of the National Internal Revenue Code. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, the Petition for Review dated February 24, 2005 filed by petitioner Fitness by Design, Inc., is hereby 
GRANTED
. Accordingly, the Final Assessment Notice dated March 17, 2004, finding petitioner liable for deficiency income tax, documentary stamp tax and value-added tax for taxable year 1995 in the total amount of P10,647,529.69 is hereby 
CANCELLED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. The Warrant of Distraint and Levy dated February 1, 2005 is likewise 
CANCELLED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.
SO ORDERED.
[31]
 (Emphasis in the original)
The Commissioner's Motion for Reconsideration and its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration were denied by the Court of Tax Appeals First Division.
[32]
Aggrieved, the Commissioner filed an appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
.
[33]
 The Commissioner asserted that it had 10 years to make an assessment due to the fraudulent income tax return filed by Fitness.
[34]
 It also claimed that the assessment already attained finality due to Fitness' failure to file its protest within the period provided by law.
[35]
Fitness argued that the Final Assessment Notice issued to it could not be claimed as a valid deficiency assessment that could justify the issuance of a warrant of distraint and/or levy.
[36]
 It asserted that it was a mere request for payment as it did not provide the period within which to pay the alleged liabilities.
[37]
The Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 ruled in favor of Fitness. It affirmed the Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals First Division, thus:
WHEREFORE
, the instant Petition for Review is 
DENIED
 for lack of merit. Accordingly, both the Decision and Resolution in CTA Case No. 7160 dated July 10, 2012 and November 21, 2012 respectively are 
AFFIRMED
 in toto.
[38]
 (Emphasis in the original)
The Commissioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the Court of Tax Appeals 
En Banc
 in the Resolution
[39]
 dated December 16, 2014.
Hence, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed before this Court a Petition for Review.
Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue raises the sole issue of whether the Final Assessment Notice issued against respondent Fitness by Design, Inc. is a valid assessment under Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99.
[40]
Petitioner argues that the Final Assessment Notice issued to respondent is valid since it complies with Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99.
[41]
 The law states that the taxpayer shall be informed in writing of the facts, jurisprudence, and law on which the assessment is based.
[42]
 Nothing in the law provides that due date for payment is a substantive requirement for the validity of a final assessment notice.
[43]
Petitioner further claims that a perusal of the Final Assessment Notice shows that April 15, 2004 is the due date for payment.
[44]
 The pertinent portion of the assessment reads:
The complete details covering the aforementioned discrepancies established during the investigation of this case are shown in the accompanying Annex 1 of this Notice. The 50% surcharge and 20% interest have been imposed pursuant to Sections 248 and 249(B) of the [National Internal Revenue Code], as amended. Please note, however, that the interest and the total amount due will have to be adjusted 
if paid prior or beyond April 15, 2004
.
[45]
 (Emphasis supplied)
This Court, through the Resolution
[46]
 dated July 22, 2015, required respondent to comment on the Petition for Review.
In its Comment,
[47]
 respondent argues that the Final Assessment Notice issued was merely a request and not a demand for payment of tax liabilities.
[48]
 The Final Assessment Notice cannot be considered as a final deficiency assessment because it deprived respondent of due process when it failed to reflect its fixed tax liabilities.
[49]
 Moreover, it also gave respondent an indefinite period to pay its tax liabilities.
[50]
Respondent points out that an assessment should strictly comply with the law for its validity.
[51]
 Jurisprudence provides that "not all documents coming from the [Bureau of Internal Revenue] containing a computation of the tax liability can be deemed assessments[,] which can attain finality."
[52]
 Therefore, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy cannot be enforced since it is based on an invalid assessment.
[53]
Respondent likewise claims that since the Final Assessment Notice was allegedly based on fraud, it must show the details of the fraudulent acts imputed to it as part of due process.
[54]
I
The Petition has no merit.
An assessment "refers to the determination of amounts due from a person obligated to make payments."
[55]
 "In the context of national internal revenue collection, it refers to the determination of the taxes due from a taxpayer under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997."
[56]
The assessment process starts with the filing of tax return and payment of tax by the taxpayer.
[57]
 The initial assessment evidenced by the tax return is a self-assessment of the taxpayer.
[58]
 The tax is primarily computed and voluntarily paid by the taxpayer without need of any demand from govemment.
[59]
 If tax obligations are properly paid, the Bureau of Internal Revenue may dispense with its own assessment.
[60]
After filing a return, the Commissioner or his or her representative may allow the examination of any taxpayer for assessment of proper tax liability.
[61]
 The failure of a taxpayer to file his or her return will not hinder the Commissioner from permitting the taxpayer's examination.
[62]
 The Commissioner can examine records or other data relevant to his or her inquiry in order to verify the correctness of any return, or to make a return in case of noncompliance, as well as to determine and collect tax liability.
[63]
The indispensability of affording taxpayers sufficient written notice of his or her tax liability is a clear definite requirement.
[64]
 Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, as amended, transparently outline the procedure in tax assessment.
[65]
Section 3 of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99,
[66]
 the then prevailing regulation regarding the due process requirement in the issuance of a deficiency tax assessment, requires a notice for informal conference.
[67]
 The revenue officer who audited the taxpayer's records shall state in his or her report whether the taxpayer concurs with his or her findings of liability for deficiency taxes.
[68]
 If the taxpayer does not agree, based on the revenue officer's report, the taxpayer shall be informed in writing
[69]
 of the discrepancies in his or her payment of internal revenue taxes for "Informal Conference."
[70]
 The informal conference gives the taxpayer an opportunity to present his or her side of the case.
[71]
The taxpayer is given 15 days from receipt of the notice of informal conference to respond.
[72]
 If the taxpayer fails to respond, he or she will be considered in default.
[73]
 The revenue officer
[74]
 endorses the case with the least possible delay to the Assessment Division of the Revenue Regional Office or the Commissioner or his or her authorized representative.
[75]
 The Assessment Division of the Revenue Regional Office or the Commissioner or his or her authorized representative is responsible for the "appropriate review and issuance of a deficiency tax assessment, if warranted."
[76]
If, after the review conducted, there exists sufficient basis to assess the taxpayer with deficiency taxes, the officer shall issue a preliminary assessment notice showing in detail the facts, jurisprudence, and law on which the assessment is based.
[77]
 The taxpayer is given 15 days from receipt of the pre-assessment notice to respond.
[78]
 If the taxpayer fails to respond, he or she will be considered in default, and a formal letter of demand and assessment notice will be issued.
[79]
The formal letter of demand and assessment notice shall state the facts, jurisprudence, and law on which the assessment was based; otherwise, these shall be void.
[80]
 The taxpayer or the authorized representative may administratively protest the formal letter of demand and assessment notice within 30 days from receipt of the notice.
[81]
II
The word "shall" in Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 means the act of informing the taxpayer of both the legal and factual bases of the assessment is mandatory.
[82]
 The law requires that the bases be reflected in the formal letter of demand and assessment notice.
[83]
 This cannot be presumed.
[84]
 Otherwise, the express mandate of Section 228 and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 would be nugatory.
[85]
 The requirement enables the taxpayer to make an effective protest or appeal of the assessment or decision.
[86]
The rationale behind the requirement that taxpayers should be informed of the facts and the law on which the assessments are based conforms with the constitutional mandate that no person shall be deprived of his or her property without due process of law.
[87]
 Between the power of the State to tax and an individual's right to due process, the scale favors the right of the taxpayer to due process.
[88]
The purpose of the written notice requirement is to aid the taxpayer in making a reasonable protest, if necessary.
[89]
 Merely notifying the taxpayer of his or her tax liabilities without details or particulars is not enough.
[90]
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. United Salvage and Towage (Phils.), Inc.
[91]
 held that a final assessment notice that only contained a table of taxes with no other details was insufficient:
In the present case, a mere perusal of the [Final Assessment Notice] for the deficiency EWT for taxable year 1994 
will show that other than a tabulation of the alleged deficiency taxes due, no further detail regarding the assessment was provided by petitioner. Only the resulting interest, surcharge and penalty were anchored with legal basis.
 Petitioner should have at least attached a detailed notice of discrepancy or stated an explanation why the amount of P48,461.76 is collectible against respondent and how the same was arrived at.
[92]
Any deficiency to the mandated content of the assessment or its process will not be tolerated.
[93]
 In 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Enron
,
[94]
 an advice of tax deficiency from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to an employee of Enron, including the preliminary five (5)-day letter, were not considered valid substitutes for the mandatory written notice of the legal and factual basis of the assessment.
[95]
 The required issuance of deficiency tax assessment notice to the taxpayer is different from the required contents of the notice.
[96]
 Thus:
The law requires that the legal and factual bases of the assessment be stated in the forma letter of demand and assessment notice. Thus, such cannot be presumed. Otherwise, the express provisions of Article 228 of the [National Internal Revenue Code] and [Revenue Regulations] No. 12-99 would be rendered nugatory.
 The alleged "factual bases" in the advice, preliminary letter and "audit working papers" did not suffice. There was no going around the mandate of the law that the legal and factual bases of the assessment be stated in writinin the formal letter of demand accompanying the assessment notice.
[97]
 (Emphasis supplied)
However, the mandate of giving the taxpayer a notice of the facts and laws on which the assessments are based should not be mechanically applied.
[98]
 To emphasize, the purpose of this requirement is to sufficiently inform the taxpayer of the bases for the assessment to enable him or her to make an intelligent protest.
[99]
In 
Samar-I Electric Cooperative v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[100]
 substantial compliance with Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code is allowed, provided that the taxpayer would be later apprised in writing of the factual and legal bases of the assessment to enable him or her to prepare for an effective protest.
[101]
 Thus:
Although the [Final Assessment Notice] and demand letter issued to petitioner were not accompanied by a written explanation of the legal and factual bases of the deficiency taxes assessed against the petitioner, the records showed that respondent in its letter dated April 10, 2003 responded to petitioner's October 14, 2002 letter-protest, explaining at length the factual and legal bases of the deficiency tax assessments and denying the protest.
Considering the foregoing exchange of correspondence and documents between the parties, we find that the requirement of Section 228 was substantially complied with. Respondent had fully informed petitioner in writing of the factual and legal bases of the deficiency taxes assessment, which enabled the latter to file an "effective" protest, much unlike the taxpayer's situation in Enron. Petitioner's right to due process was thus not violated.
[102]
A final assessment notice provides for the amount of tax due with a demand for payment.
[103]
 This is to determine the amount of tax due to a taxpayer.
[104]
 However, due process requires that taxpayers be informed in writing of the facts and law on which the assessment is based in order to aid the taxpayer in making a reasonable protest.
[105]
 To immediately ensue with tax collection without initially substantiating a valid assessment contravenes the principle in administrative investigations "that tax ayers should be able to present their case and adduce supporting evidence."
[106]
Respondent filed its income tax return in 1995.
[107]
 Almost eight (8) years passed before the disputed final assessment notice was issued. Respondent pleaded prescription as its defense when it filed a protest to the Final Assessment Notice. Petitioner claimed fraud assessment to justify the belated assessment made on respondent.
[108]
 If fraud was indeed present, the period of assessment should be within 10 years.
[109]
 It is incumbent upon petitioner to clearly state the allegations of fraud committed by respondent to serve the purpose of an assessment notice to aid respondent in filing an effective protest.
III
The prescriptive period in making an assessment depends upon whether a tax return was filed or whether the tax return filed was either false or fraudulent. When a tax return that is neither false nor fraudulent has been filed, the Bureau of Internal Revenue may assess within three (3) years, reckoned from the date of actual filing or from the last day prescribed by law for filing.
[110]
 However, in case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax, Section 222(a) provides:
Section 222. Exceptions as to Period of Limitation of Assessment and Collection of Taxes. -
(a) In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be filed without assessment, at 
any time within ten (10) years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud or omission: Provided
, That in a fraud assessment which has become final and executory, the fact of fraud shall be judicially taken cognizance of in the civil or criminal action for the collection thereof. (Emphasis supplied)
In 
Aznar v. Court of Tax Appeals
,
[111]
 this Court interpreted Section 332
[112]
 (now Section 222[a] of the National Internal Revenue Code) by dividing it in three (3) different cases: first, in case of false return; second, in case of a fraudulent return with intent to evade; and third, in case of failure to file a return.
[113]
 Thus:
Our stand that the law should be interpreted to mean a separation of the three different situations of false return, fraudulent return with intent to evade tax and failure to file a return is strengthened immeasurably by the last portion of the provision which aggregates the situations into three different classes, namely "falsity", "fraud" and "omission."
[114]
This Court held that there is a difference between "false return" and a "fraudulent return."
[115]
 A false return simply involves a "deviation from the truth, whether intentional or not" while a fraudulent return "implies intentional or deceitful entry with intent to evade the taxes due."
[116]
Fraud is a question of fact that should be alleged and duly proven.
[117]
 "The willful neglect to file the required tax return or the fraudulent intent to evade the payment of taxes, considering that the same is accompanied by legal consequences, cannot be presumed."
[118]
 Fraud entails corresponding sanctions under the tax law. Therefore, it is indispensable for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to include the basis for its allegations of fraud in the assessment notice.
During the proceedings in the Court of Tax Appeals First Division, respondent presented its President, Domingo C. Juan Jr. (Juan, Jr.), as witness.
[119]
 Juan, Jr. testified that respondent was in its pre-operating stage in 1995.
[120]
 During that period, respondent "imported equipment and distributed them for market testing in the Philippines without earning any profit."
[121]
 He also confirmed that the Final Assessment Notice and its attachments failed to substantiate the Commissioner's allegations of fraud against respondent, thus:
More than three (3) years from the time petitioner filed its 1995 annual income tax return on April 11, 1996, respondent issued to petitioner a [Final Assessment Notice] dated March 17, 2004 for the year 1995, pursuant to the Letter of Authority No. 00002953 dated May 13, 2002. The attached Details of discrepancy containing the assessment for income tax (IT), value-added tax (VAT) and documentary stamp tax (DST) as well as the Audit Result/Assessment Notice 
do not impute fraud on the part of petitioner
. Moreover, it was obtained on information and documents illegally obtained by a [Bureau of Internal Revenue] informant from petitioner's accountant Elnora Carpio in 1996.
[122]
 (Emphasis supplied)
Petitioner did not refute respondent's allegations. For its defense, it presented Socrates Regala (Regala), the Group Supervisor of the team, who examined respondent's tax liabilities.
[123]
 Regala confirmed that the investigation was prompted by a tip from an informant who provided them with respondent's list of sales.
[124]
 He admitted
[125]
 that the gathered information did not show that respondent deliberately failed to reflect its true income in 1995.
[126]
IV
The issuance of a valid formal assessment is a substantive prerequisite for collection of taxes.
[127]
 Neither the National Internal Revenue Code nor the revenue regulations provide for a "specific definition or form of an assessment." However, the National Internal Revenue Code defines its explicit functions and effects.
[128]
 An assessment does not only include a computation of tax liabilities; it also includes a demand for payment within a period prescribed.
[129]
 Its main purpose is to determine the amount that a taxpayer is liable to pay.
[130]
A pre-assessment notice "do[es] not bear the gravity of a formal assessment notice."
[131]
 A pre-assessment notice merely gives a tip regarding the Bureau of Internal Revenue's findings against a taxpayer for an informal conference or a clarificatory meeting.
[132]
A final assessment is a notice "to the effect that the amount therein stated is due as tax and a demand for payment thereof."
[133]
 This demand for payment signals the time "when penalties and interests begin to accrue against the taxpayer and enabling the latter to determine his remedies[.]"
[134]
 Thus, it must be "sent to and received by the taxpayer, and must demand payment of the taxes described therein within a specific period."
[135]
The disputed Final Assessment Notice is not a valid assessment.
First, it lacks the definite amount of tax liability for which respondent is accountable. It does not purport to be a demand for payment of tax due, which a final assessment notice should supposedly be. An assessment, in the context of the National Internal Revenue Code, is a "written notice and demand made by the [Bureau of Internal Revenue] on the taxpayer for the settlement of a due tax liability that is there definitely set and fixed."
[136]
 Although the disputed notice provides for the computations of respondent's tax liability, the amount remains indefinite. It only provides that the tax due is still subject to modification, depending on the date of payment. Thus:
The complete details covering the aforementioned discrepancies established during the investigation of this case are shown in the accompanying Annex 1 of this Notice. The 50% surcharge and 20% interest have been imposed pursuant to Sections 248 and 249 (B) of the [National Internal Revenue Code], as amended. Please note, 
however, that the interest and the total amount due will have to be adjusted if prior or beyond April 15, 2004.
[137]
 (Emphasis Supplied)
Second, there are no due dates in the Final Assessment Notice. This negates petitioner's demand for payment.
[138]
 Petitioner's contention that April 15, 2004 should be regarded as the actual due date cannot be accepted. The last paragraph of the Final Assessment Notice states that the due dates for payment were supposedly reflected in the attached assessment:
In view thereof, you are 
requested to pay
 your aforesaid deficiency internal revenue tax liabilities through the duly authorized agent bank in which ou are enrolled 
within the time shown in the enclosed assessment notice
.
[139]
 (Emphasis in the original)
However, based on the findings of the Court of Tax Appeals First Division, the enclosed assessment pertained to remained unaccomplished.
[140]
Contrary to petitioner's view, April 15, 2004 was the reckoning date of accrual of penalties and surcharges and not the due date for payment of tax liabilities. The total amount depended upon when respondent decides to pay. The notice, therefore, did not contain a definite and actual demand to pay.
Compliance with Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code is a substantive requirement.
[141]
 It is not a mere formality.
[142]
 Providing the taxpayer with the factual and legal bases for the assessment is crucial before proceeding with tax collection. Tax collection should be premised on a valid assessment, which would allow the taxpayer to present his or her case and produce evidence for substantiation.
[143]
The Court of Tax Appeals did not err in cancelling the Final Assessment Notice as well as the Audit Result/Assessment Notice issued by petitioner to respondent for the year 1995 covering the "alleged deficiency income tax, value-added tax and documentary stamp tax amounting to P10,647,529.69, inclusive of surcharges and interest"
[144]
 for lack of due process. Thus, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy is void since an invalid assessment bears no valid effect.
[145]
Taxes are the lifeblood of government and should be collected without hindrance.
[146]
 However, the collection of taxes should be exercised "reasonably and in accordance with the prescribed procedure."
[147]
The essential nature of taxes for the existence of the State grants government with vast remedies to ensure its collection. However, taxpayers are guaranteed their fundamental right to due process of law, as articulated in various ways in the process of tax assessment. After all, the State's purpose is to ensure the well-being of its citizens, not simply to deprive them of their fundamental rights.

did not indicate that petitioner's failure to state in its ITR its income and sales for the year 1995 was deliberate
