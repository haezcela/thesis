SPOUSES ALFONSO ALCUITAS, SR. (DECEASED-REPRESENTED BY HIS HEIRS) AND ESTELA ALCUITAS (FOR HERSELF AND AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED ALFONSO ALCUITAS, SR.), PETITIONERS, VS. MINVILUZ C. VILLANUEVA, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


Assailed in this petition is the June 14, 2013 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of 
Appeals (
CA
) which reversed and set aside the May 31,
 2002 Decision
[2]
 
of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 18, Pagadian City 
(
RTC
), which dismissed the Complaint for Redemption 
of Real Property under Commonwealth Act No. 141 filed by respondent 
Minviluz C. Villanueva (
Villanueva
) against 
petitioners Spouses Alfonso Alcuitas, Sr. and Estela Alcuitas 
(
Spouses Alcuitas
).




The Factual Antecedents



Records show that Villanueva is the registered owner of a parcel of lot 
containing an area of 712 square meters, more or less, and located at 
Poblacion, Municipality of Buug, Province of Zamboanga del Sur, 
originally covered by Original Certificate of Title 
(
OCT
) No. P-32, 887 and issued by virtue of the grant
 of Free Patent No. IX-6-121.



Since June 1988, Spouses Alcuitas have been lessees over the subject 
property operating therein a gasoline station with a term due to expire 
by June 2009.
[3]



On June 22, 1993, Villanueva mortgaged her parcel of land in favor of a 
certain Lucas Datoy as security for the payment of her loan obligation 
of P200,000.00. Villanueva reneged on her loan obligation so the 
mortgage on the subject property was foreclosed under Act No. 3135, as 
amended. When the property was put up for sale in a public auction, 
Spouses Alcuitas bought it for P201,000.00.



The sheriff executed a definite deed of sale in favor of Spouses 
Alcuitas after Villanueva's failure to redeem the subject property 
within the one-year redemption under Act No. 3135. Accordingly, title 
over the subject property was consolidated in favor of Spouses Alcuitas 
and OCT No. P-32, 887 was cancelled and, finally, Transfer Certificate 
of Title (TCT) No. T-32, 392 was issued in the name of Spouses Alcuitas.



Villanueva informed Spouses Alcuitas of her desire and intention to 
redeem the subject property at the price of P201,000.00 but the latter 
refused her offer. Villanueva then proceeded to tender the amount of 
P201,000.00 as redemption price to Spouses Alcuitas and consigned said 
amount in the Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC of Pagadian City. 
In view of the failure of both parties to settle the matter at the 
barangay level, Villanueva filed a complaint for Redemption of Real 
Property under Commonwealth Act (
C.A.
) No. 141 
against the petitioners before the RTC.



On the other hand, Spouses Alcuitas averred that Villanueva is guilty of
 fraud, misrepresentation and intentional concealment when she failed to
 inform them about the mortgage of the subject property to Lucas Datoy 
during the time when both parties entered into a contract of lease 
covering the subject property; that they never refused to accede to 
Villanueva's willingness to repurchase the subject property; that 
redemption of the subject property was moot and academic because it had 
been transferred in their names; that Villanueva failed to redeem the 
subject property within the reglementary period; and that Villanueva 
made no tender of payment.




Decision of the RTC



On May 31, 2002, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of Spouses Alcuitas dismissing Villanueva's complaint.



It explained, among others, that Villanueva's right to repurchase the 
subject property under Section 119 of C.A. No. 141 is baseless for the 
following reasons:


1)  It is indubitable that the subject property has 
been reclassified from its previous classification consistent with the 
patent covering the land, i.e., as agricultural to commercial lot, 
consistent with its actual use and location per zoning ordinance in 
accordance with the Comprehensive Municipal Land Use and Town Plan of 
the Municipality of Buug, Zamboanga del Sur, where the property is 
located;



2) The rationale of the passage of the law granting unto the Patentee 
the right to repurchase, i.e., to preserve the property to the Grantee 
who was a recipient from the government of a public land grant which was
 designed to distribute disposable agricultural lots of the State to 
land destitute citizens for their cultivation, is very much wanting to 
be availing with the reclassification of the subject property;



3) In the case of 
Santana vs. MariÃ±as
, 94 SCRA 753, 
reiterating the doctrine laid down in the case of 
Sinedon vs. 
PeÃ±a
, 36 SCRA 617, cited in the case of 
Bargas vs. 
Court of Appeals
, 91 SCRA 195, the Supreme Court ruled that 
the undergoing principle of Sec. 119 of C.A. No. 141 is to give the 
Homesteader as Patentee every chance to preserve for himself and his 
family the land that the State has gratuitously given to him as a reward
 for his labor, in cleaning and cultivating it. However, when the 
property has already been reclassified and no longer used for 
agricultural purposes having been reclassified as commercial lot and 
utilized as such, the spirit of the law granting unto the patentee the 
right of repurchase can no longer be made availing, its purpose, i.e., 
to preserve the land for cultivation is no longer there, for which 
reason, repurchase in such a situation would do violence to what C.A. 
141 stands for and the same will no longer be consistent with the spirit
 and purpose of the law, the purchaser is not the kind of farmer for 
whom the Homestead and Free Patent were intended by law.
[4]
The dispositive portion of the May 31, 2002 RTC decision reads:


WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing disquisitions, the
 instant complaint is hereby DISMISSED for wanting of a cause of action.
 As a consequence, the defendants being compelled to incur litigation 
expenses to protect their rights and interests brought about by the 
filing of an unfounded complaint, it is but proper to order the 
plaintiff to pay unto the defendants the sum of One Hundred Thousand 
(P100,000.00) Pesos as actual, compensatory and nominal damages and to 
pay the costs of litigation.



SO ORDERED.
[5]
Decision of the CA



On appeal, the CA 
reversed
 and 
set 
aside
 the decision of the RTC. The CA ruled that Villanueva 
had the clear statutory right to repurchase the subject property under 
Section 119 of C.A. No. 141. The CA stated that Villanueva exercised her 
right to repurchase or re-acquire the subject property when she filed 
the subject complaint before the RTC. The filing was equivalent to an 
offer to repurchase the same and to which offer, Spouses Alcuitas 
admitted, they never acceded.



The CA opined that the mere reclassification of the subject land from 
residential to commercial could not 
ipso facto
 
deprive Villanueva of her right to repurchase. The CA stated that C.A. 
No. 141 did not provide that the right of repurchase ceases once the 
subject property's nature and classification changes. Section 119 of C.A.
 No. 141 did not make any qualification as to how the property shall be 
utilized. It further wrote that what the law sought to enforce was that 
the repurchase must be for the purpose of preserving the land for the 
use of the patentee and his family. It adhered to the policy of 
preservation to the patentee and his family given by the law must be 
liberally construed in order to carry out its purpose.



The CA explained that Villanueva's primary purpose for repurchasing the 
subject property was for residential purposes and not for any other 
purposes. The fact that the subject property had been utilized as a 
gasoline station within a commercial zone was of no moment because the 
commercial classification of the subject property could not serve as a 
justification to defeat Villanueva's right to repurchase under C.A. No. 
141. Villanueva's right to repurchase could not be arbitrarily denied 
under the guise of land reclassification because to allow such situation
 would put a premium on vendees acquiring patented lands because they 
would convert the subject property into a commercial one to retain 
ownership over it. This situation is repugnant to the purpose of C.A. No.
 141.



Unsatisfied with the CA's decision, Spouses Alcuitas come to this Court 
via a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45
 of the Rules of Court anchoring their petition on the following


ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS




THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT VILLANUEVA WAS ABLE 
TO ESTABLISH HER RIGHT TO REPURCHASE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY UNDER 
COMMONWEALTH ACT NO. 141.



THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE MERE RECLASSIFICATION OF 
LAND CANNOT DEPRIVE VILLANUEVA OF HER RIGHT TO 
REPURCHASE.
Spouses Alcuitas' position



Spouses Alcuitas argued that the CA's unfavorable ruling resulted in the
 economic prejudice and grave injustice to them because Villanueva would
 unjustly enrich herself at their expense considering that they had 
already developed the entire subject property into a Class A gasoline 
station and car service center, spending so much for the improvements 
introduced. They likewise pointed out that the amount offered by 
Villanueva to repurchase the subject property was unconscionable. 
Finally, they averred that Villanueva could no longer rely on the 
principle in Section 119 of C.A. 141 considering that the subject 
property had already been reclassified into a commercial lot.




Villanueva's position



Villanueva argued that Spouses Alcuitas failed to perfect the subject 
petition on time due to the following procedural grounds, to wit: 1) 
failure of their counsel to comply with the mandatory MCLE requirement 
specifically MCLE No. IV; and 2) failure to comply with the mandatory 
requirement of a valid verification and certification.




The Court's Ruling



The petition lacks merit.



Simply, the crucial issues that need to be resolved in this case are: 1)
 whether Villanueva has the right to repurchase the subject property 
from Spouses Alcuitas; and 2) whether Villanueva's right to repurchase 
the subject property ceased upon the reclassification of the same into a
 commercial zone.



To recap, Spouses Alcuitas have posed two (2) main objections on 
Villanueva's decision to repurchase the subject property. 

First
, the amount offered for the repurchase of the 
subject property was so unconscionable considering that they incurred 
necessary and useful expenses and introduced improvements therein. If 
the repurchase of the subject property would push through with such an 
unconscionable offer, it would result to their economic prejudice. 

Second
, Villanueva had lost her right to repurchase 
under Section 119 of C.A. No. 141 because of the reclassification of the
 subject property from a residential zone to a commercial zone.



Spouses Alcuitas' arguments fail to persuade.




Villanueva has the statutory right to 
repurchase the subject property under 
Section 119 of C.A. No. 141.



Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, reads:


SEC. 119. Every conveyance of land acquired under the 
free patent or homestead provisions, when proper, shall be subject to 
repurchase by the applicant, his widow, or legal heirs, within a period 
of five years from the date of the conveyance.
It is crystal clear from the above provision that patentees or 
homesteaders of land including their family are given the right to 
repurchase the homestead land which they have conveyed to another within
 a limited period of time. The purpose and spirit of the law has been 
discussed in numerous cases. In 
Heirs of Venancio Bajenting vs.
 Romeo F. Baez
,
[6]
 it was written:


As elucidated by this Court, the object of the 
provisions of Act 141, as amended, granting rights and privileges to 
patentees or homesteaders is to provide a house for each citizen where 
his family may settle and live beyond the reach of financial misfortune 
and to inculcate in the individuals the feelings of independence which 
are essential to the maintenance of free institution. The State is 
called upon to ensure that the citizen shall not be divested of needs 
for support, and reclined to pauperism. The Court, likewise, emphasized 
that the purpose of such law is conservation of a family home in keeping
 with the policy of the State to foster families as the factors of 
society and, thus, promote public welfare. The sentiment of patriotism 
and independence, the spirit of citizenship, the feeling of interest in 
public affairs, are cultivated and fostered more readily when the 
citizen lives permanently in his own house with a sense of its 
protection and durability. It is intended to promote the spread of small
 land ownership and the preservation of public land grants in the names 
of the underprivileged for whose benefits they are specially intended 
and whose welfare is a special concern of the State. The law is intended
 to commence ownership of lands acquired as homestead by the patentee or
 homesteader or his heirs.
[7]
The reclassification of the subject property 
into a commercial 
zone cannot stop 
Villanueva from exercising her right to 
repurchase the 
same under Section 119 
of C.A. No. 141.



The Court agrees with the CA that the mere reclassification of the 
subject property from residential to commercial does not 
ipso 
facto
 deprive Villanueva of her right to repurchase the same. 
The Court is also of the view that the law does not make any 
qualification as to how the property shall be utilized and that the 
right to repurchase does not cease once the property's nature and 
classification are changed.



What the law strictly requires is that the repurchase must be for the 
purpose of preserving the land for the use of the patentee and his 
family. The law gives more importance to the purpose behind the 
patentee's repurchase than the reclassification or utilization of the 
property. More importantly, the law focuses on the preservation of 
public land grants and the conservation of the family home for the 
underprivileged citizens - which is the primordial concern of the State.



Although it is true that a gasoline station has been built on the 
subject property and the same has been reclassified into a commercial 
zone, Villanueva's primary purpose for repurchasing said property is for
 residential purposes. There is no evidence whatsoever that the purpose 
behind Villanueva's decision to repurchase the same was for commercial 
profit or for anything other than residential family use. There is no 
proof either that Villanueva had the intention to re-sell the subject 
property for monetary gain or profit.



For the Court, Spouses Alcuitas' argument that the repurchase of the 
subject property would result in economic prejudice and grave injustice 
to them again fails to move us. 
First
, they did not 
raise this argument in their answer.
[8]
 In fact, Spouses Alcuitas expressly stated in 
their answer that they never refused to accede to Villanueva's 
willingness to repurchase the subject property. 

Second
, as found by the CA, their lease contract with
 Villanueva expressly stipulated that "the lessee may, aside from the 
existing building, construct or erect at its option, an additional 
structure and install such machinery, facilities and equipment at the 
back of the lease premises as it may consider necessary or convenient 
for the operation of its business 
at its own 
expense
."
[9]
 Besides, they knew that their lease contract was
 
up to June 2009 only
.



In any event, the homestead provision in this particular case leans 
towards the objective of protecting Villanueva whose only desire and 
intent was to repurchase the homestead land she once lost in order to 
start a new family life. The commercial reclassification of the subject 
property cannot divest Villanueva of her statutory right to repurchase 
the subject property.




The rulings in Simeon v. PeÃ±a, 
Vargas v. Court of Appeals and 
Santana v. MariÃ±as cases not 
applicable
 
Contrary to the posture of Spouses Alcuitas, the 
Francisco 
Santana v. Sotero MariÃ±as
,
[10]
 
Marina B. Vargas v. The Court of 
Appeals
,
[11]
 and 
Deogracias Simeon v. Lourdes 
PeÃ±a
[12]

 cases cited by the RTC in its decision cannot be applied in this case.



Although it is true that the subject land in the 

Santana
 case involved a commercial area, the 
homesteader therein was not allowed to repurchase the homestead lot 
because he primarily wanted to exploit the land for business purposes. 
Similarly, the homesteaders in the 
Vargas
 case and 

Simeon
 case were also prohibited from repurchasing 
the subject homestead lots because their motives were speculative and 
for profit. In all these cases, the repurchase was not for the purpose 
of preserving the land for the family but for greater profit in 
violation of the policy and spirit of the law. Reselling for profit, and
 not preservation for the family, was foremost in the minds of the 
homesteaders in these three (3) cases.
