THE COFFEE BEAN AND TEA LEAF PHILIPPINES, INC. AND WALDEN CHU, PETITIONERS, VS. ROLLY P. ARENAS, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




BRION, J.:


We resolve in this petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 the challenge to the Court of Appealsâ (CA) decision
[2]
 dated March 26, 2013 and resolution
[3]
 dated August 30, 2013 in CA-G.R. SP No. 117822.  These assailed CA rulings affirmed the National Labor Relations Commissionâs (
NLRC
) decision
[4]
 dated August 13, 2010, which also affirmed the Labor Arbiterâs (
LA
) February 28, 2010 decision.
The Antecedent Facts
On April 1, 2008, the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Philippines, Inc. (
CBTL
) hired Rolly P. Arenas (
Arenas
) to work as a âbaristaâ at its Paseo Center Branch. His principal functions included taking orders from customers and preparing their ordered food and beverages.
[5]
  Upon signing the employment contract,
[6]
 Arenas was informed of CBTLâs existing employment policies.
To ensure the quality of its crewâs services, CBTL regularly employs a âmystery guest shopperâ who poses as a customer, for the purpose of covertly inspecting the baristasâ job performance.
[7]
In April 2009, a mystery guest shopper at the Paseo Center Branch submitted a report stating that on March 30, 2009, Arenas was seen eating non-CBTL products at CBTLâs 
al fresco
 dining area while on duty.  As a result, the counter was left empty without anyone to take and prepare the customersâ orders.
[8]
On another occasion, or on April 28, 2009, Katrina Basallo (Basallo), the duty manager of CBTL, conducted a routine inspection of the Paseo Center Branch. While inspecting the storeâs products, she noticed an iced tea bottle being chilled inside the bin where the ice for the customersâ drinks is stored; thus, she called the attention of the staff on duty. When asked, Arenas muttered, â
kaninong iced tea
?â and immediately picked the bottle and disposed it outside the store.
[9]
After inspection, Basallo prepared a store managerâs report which listed Arenasâ recent infractions, as follows:
Leaving the counter unattended and eating chips in an unauthorized area while on duty (March 30, 2009);
Reporting late for work on several occasions (April 1, 3 and 22); and
Placing an iced tea bottle in the ice bin despite having knowledge of company policy prohibiting the same (April 28, 2009).
[10]
Based on the mystery guest shopper and duty managerâs reports, Arenas was required to explain his alleged violations. However, CBTL found Arenasâ written explanation unsatisfactory, hence CBTL terminated his employment.
[11]
Arenas filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.  After due proceedings, the LA ruled in his favor, declaring that he had been illegally dismissed.  On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the LAâs decision.
CBTL filed a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 before the CA.  CBTL insisted that Arenasâ infractions amounted to serious misconduct or willful disobedience, gross and habitual neglect of duties, and breach of trust and confidence. To support these allegations, CBTL presented Arenasâ letter
[12]
 where he admitted his commission of the imputed violations.
On March 26, 2013, the CA issued its decision dismissing the petition.  The  CA ruled  that Arenasâ offenses fell short of the required legal standards to justify his dismissal; and that these do not constitute serious misconduct or willful disobedience, and gross negligence, to merit his termination from service. The CA denied CBTLâs motion for reconsideration opening the way for this present appeal 
via
 a petition for review on 
certiorari.
The main issue before us is whether CBTL illegally dismissed Arenas from employment.
The Petition
CBTL argues that under the terms and conditions of the employment contract, Arenas agreed to abide and comply with CBTLâs policies, procedures,  rules  and  regulations,  as  provided  for  under  CBTLâs table of  offenses  and  penalties and/or employee handbook.
[13]
  CBTL cites 
serious misconduct
 as the primary reason for terminating Arenasâ employment.  CBTL also imputes dishonesty on the part of Arenas for not immediately admitting that he indeed left his bottled iced tea inside the ice bin.
Our Ruling
We DENY the petition.
As a rule, in 
certiorari
 proceedings under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the CA does not assess and weigh each piece of evidence introduced in the case.  The CA only examines the factual findings of the NLRC to determine whether its conclusions are supported by substantial evidence, whose absence points to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
[14]
  In the case of 
Mercado v. AMA Computer College
,
[15]
 we emphasized that:
As a general rule, in 
certiorari
 proceedings under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the appellate court does not assess and weigh the sufficiency of evidence upon which the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC based their conclusion. The query in this proceeding is limited to the determination of whether or not the NLRC acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in rendering its decision. x x x
[16]
 [Italics supplied]
Our review of the records shows that the CA did not err in affirming the LA and the NLRCâs rulings. No grave abuse of discretion tainted these rulings, thus, the CAâs decision also warrants this Courtâs affirmation. The infractions which Arenas committed do not justify the application of the severe penalty of termination from service.
First, Arenas was found eating non-CBTL products inside the storeâs premises while on duty. Allegedly, he left the counter unattended without anyone to entertain the incoming customers. Second, he chilled his bottled iced tea inside the ice bin, in violation of CBTLâs sanitation and hygiene policy. CBTL argues that these violations constitute willful disobedience, thus meriting dismissal from employment.
We disagree with CBTL.
For willful disobedience to be a valid cause for dismissal, these two elements must concur: (1) the employeeâs assailed conduct must have been 
willful
, that is, characterized by a 
wrongful and perverse attitude
; and (2) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee, and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge.
[17]
Tested against these standards, it is clear that Arenasâ alleged infractions do not amount to such a wrongful and perverse attitude. Though Arenas may have admitted these wrongdoings, these do not amount to a wanton disregard of CBTLâs company policies. As Arenas mentioned in his written explanation, he was on a scheduled break when he was caught eating at CBTLâs 
al fresco
 dining area. During that time, the other service crews were the one in charge of manning the counter. Notably, CBTLâs employee handbook imposes only the penalty of 
written warning
 for the offense of eating non-CBTL products inside the storeâs premises.
CBTL also imputes gross and habitual neglect of duty to Arenas for coming in late in three separate instances.
Gross negligence implies a want or absence of, or failure to exercise even a slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care.  It evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them.
[18]
 There is habitual neglect if based on the circumstances, there is a repeated failure to perform oneâs duties for a period of time.
[19]
In light of the foregoing criteria, we rule that Arenasâ three counts of tardiness cannot be considered as gross and habitual neglect of duty. The infrequency of his tardiness already removes the character of habitualness. These late attendances were also broadly spaced out, negating the complete absence of care on Arenasâ part in the performance of his duties. Even CBTL admitted in its notice to explain that this violation does not merit yet a disciplinary action and is only an aggravating circumstance to Arenasâ other violations.
[20]
To further justify Arenasâ dismissal, CBTL argues that he committed serious misconduct when he lied about using the ice bin as cooler for his bottled iced tea. Under CBTLâs employee handbook, dishonesty, even at the first instance, warrants the penalty of termination from service.
[21]
For misconduct or improper behavior to be a just cause for dismissal, (a) it must be serious; (b) it must relate to the performance of the employeeâs duties; and (c) it must 
show that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer.
[22]
However, the facts on record reveal that there was no active dishonesty on the part of Arenas. When questioned about who placed the bottled iced tea inside the ice bin, his immediate reaction was not to deny his mistake, but to remove the bottle inside the bin and throw it outside. More importantly, when he was asked to make a written explanation of his action, he admitted that the bottled iced tea was his.
Thus, even if there was an initial reticence on Arenasâ part, his subsequent act of owing to his mistake only shows the absence of a deliberate intent to lie or deceive his CBTL superiors. On this score, we conclude that Arenasâ action did not amount to serious misconduct.
Moreover, the imputed violations of Arenas, whether taken singly or as a whole, do not necessitate the imposition of the strict and harsh penalty of dismissal from service. The LA, NLRC and the CA 
all consistently ruled
 that these offenses are not grave enough to qualify as just causes for dismissal. 
Factual findings of the labor tribunals especially if affirmed by the CA must be given great weight, and merit the Courtâs respect
.
As a final remark, we note that petitioner Walden Chu (
Chu
) should not be held jointly and severally liable with CBTL for Arenasâ adjudged monetary awards. The LA and the NLRC ruled for their solidary liability but the CA failed to dispose this issue in its decision.
A corporation is a juridical entity with a legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it.
[23]
 Thus, as a general rule, an officer may not be held liable for the corporationâs labor obligations unless he acted with evident malice and/or bad faith in dismissing an employee.
[24]
In the present case, there was no showing of any evident malice or bad faith on Chuâs part as CBTLâs president. His participation in Arenasâ termination was not even sufficiently alleged and argued. Hence, he cannot be held solidarily liable for CBTLâs liabilities to Arenas.
WHEREFORE
, in light of these considerations, we hereby 
DENY
 the petition for lack of merit. The Court of Appeals committed no grave abuse of discretion in its decision of March 26, 2013 and its resolution of August 30, 2013 in CA-G.R. SP No. 117822, except with respect to the liability of petitioner Walden Chu.  We thus absolve petitioner Walden Chu from paying in his personal capacity the monetary awards of respondent Rolly P. Arenas. No costs.
