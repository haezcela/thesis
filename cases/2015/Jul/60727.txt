In the commission of the offense, the qualifying circumstances of relationship is attendant, the accused being the father of the complainant and the complainant being then under eighteen (18) years of age.
Contrary to Law.
[6]
The prosecution established that AAA was born on December 17, 1993. She is the daughter of appellant and BBB. They resided at Sitio XXX, Barangay XXX, Municipality of Victoria, Province of Oriental Mindoro.
Sometime in March 2007, at around 11:00 p.m., while AAA's mother BBB was not in the house, appellant removed AAA's clothes, took his own clothes off and ordered AAA to lie down. Appellant mounted on top of AAA and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA felt pain. After satisfying his lust, appellant ordered AAA to wear her clothes and walk away. Out of fear of her father's threats, she did not divulge the incident to anyone.
Sometime in June 2007, appellant and AAA were planting coconut seedlings in a coconut plantation in Barangay XXX. Again, appellant removed AAA's clothes and ordered her to lie down on the banana leaf gathered by appellant. Appellant inserted his penis into AAA's vagina and fondled her breast.
Around October 2007, while at a lanzones plantation in Barangay XXX, appellant approached AAA, ordered her to lie down on the grass and took her clothes off. Then appellant inserted his penis into AAA's vagina, fondled her breast and kissed her lips. Thereafter, appellant clothed AAA and ordered her to collect the lanzones.
Sometime in 2008, appellant attempted to rape AAA in their house. He was able to undress her but failed to rape her.
Several months later, BBB noticed that AAA's stomach was getting bigger. BBB took AAA to a 
hilot
 who told BBB that AAA is eight months pregnant. It was at this time that AAA told BBB that she was raped by her father. AAA gave birth to a baby boy whom they gave away for adoption. AAA said that she wants her father to pay for his crime.
Appellant denied the charges and insisted that they were instigated by some persons unknown to him to destroy his good reputation and character.
In its Decision
[7]
 dated December 6, 2011, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Oriental Mindoro, Branch 39, found appellant guilty of three counts of rape and one count of acts of lasciviousness. The 
fallo
 of the RTC Decision reads:
ACCORDINGLY,

SUCCESSIVELY.
SO ORDERED.
[8]
The RTC ruled that the prosecution was able to prove that appellant raped his own daughter AAA sometime in March 2007, June 2007 and October 2007. The RTC noted that AAA categorically testified as to the commission of the rapes and that AAA positively identified appellant as the perpetrator. The medico-legal report stating that AAA has healed hymenal lacerations also confirmed AAA's testimony, said the RTC. The RTC also noted that at the time she was raped, AAA was only 14 years old as she was born on December 17, 1993 per her birth certificate. Aside from appellant's admission that AAA is his daughter, the same certificate also proved the qualifying circumstance of relationship between appellant and AAA. The RTC rejected appellant's denial on the ground that it cannot prevail over AAA's positive testimony. On the charge of attempted rape, the RTC found appellant guilty of acts of lasciviousness. The RTC noted that while appellant was able to undress AAA and tried to sexually assault her, there is no showing that appellant's penis touched any part of AAA's body.
Appellant appealed and claimed that the RTC erred in convicting him despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Appellant averred that the RTC is expected to properly evaluate and weigh the testimony of the witnesses, particularly of the victim herself.
The CA dismissed the appeal and affirmed the RTC Decision with modification in that the award of exemplary damages in the three rape cases was increased to P30,000 and 6% interest per annum was imposed on all the damages awarded. The 
fallo
 of the assailed CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE,
 the appeal is 
DISMISSED.
 The December 6, 2011 Joint Decision x x x of the Regional Trial Court of Oriental Mindoro, Branch 39 in Criminal Case Nos. x x x CR-08-9204, CR-08-9205, CR-08[-]9206 and 08-9207 are 
AFFIRMED
 with modifications in that the amount of exemplary damages awarded to "AAA" in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9204, CR-08-9205, CR-08[-]9206 is increased to P30,000.00 for each case, and interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum is imposed on all the damages awarded from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.
[9]
The CA found that AAA was telling the truth when she declared that her father raped her on three separate occasions. The CA said that AAA was consistent in her narration on how she was abused by her father in their own house, in the coconut plantation and in the lanzones plantation. The CA also agreed with the RTC's finding that appellant is guilty of acts of lasciviousness when he removed her clothes and tried to sexually assault her a fourth time. Appellant's acts clearly showed lewdness and are indecent and inappropriate, said the CA.
Hence, this appeal. Appellant filed a manifestation in lieu of a supplemental brief.
We dismiss the appeal for lack of merit. The RTC and CA did not err in convicting appellant for three counts of rape and one count of acts of lasciviousness. On appellant's claim that the RTC was expected to properly evaluate and weigh the testimony of the witnesses, particularly of the victim herself, we note that the RTC properly considered AAA's testimony in ruling that AAA categorically testified as to the commission of the rapes and positively identified appellant as her rapist. In fact, the RTC quoted AAA's testimony in its Decision, to wit:

A:

[12]
 
 
The CA also found that AAA was telling the truth when she declared that her father raped her on three separate occasions. The rule is that the determination by the trial court of the credibility of witnesses, when affirmed by the appellate court, as in this case, is accorded full weight and credit as well as great respect, if not conclusive effect.
[13]
 And after our own examination of AAA's testimony, we find no reason to disagree with the RTC and CA in finding AAA as a credible witness.
We also agree with the RTC in rejecting appellant's denial of the rape charges against him. Said denial cannot prevail over AAA's credible and positive testimony that appellant raped her.
[14]
Article 266-A of the 
Revised Penal Code
 provides that the crime of rape is committed by a man having carnal laiowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (1) through force, threat or intimidation; (2) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; (3) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and (4) when the offended party is under 12 years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. In incestuous rape of a minor, actual force or intimidation need not be employed where the overpowering moral influence of the father would suffice.
[15]
 In this case, appellant had carnal knowledge three times of his daughter, AAA, who was then only 14 years old.
As regards appellant's conviction for acts of lasciviousness, not for attempted rape, we find no reason to disturb it. Appellant's acts of undressing AAA and trying to sexually assault her a fourth time are lascivious acts. These acts are clearly lewd, indecent and inappropriate. Lewdness is defined as an "obscene, lustful, indecent, and lecherous" act which signifies that form of immorality carried on a wanton manner.
[16]
 Indeed, appellant cannot be convicted of attempted rape since appellant's penis never touched any part of AAA's body.
[17]
 For there to be an attempted rape, the accused must have commenced the act of penetrating his sexual organ to the vagina of the victim but for some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance, the penetration, however, slight, is not completed.
[18]
For the crimes of rape, the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility for parole, and the award of P75,000 as civil indemnity, P75,000 as moral damages and P30,000 as exemplary damages for each count were correct.
[19]
 For the crime of acts of lasciviousness, the penalty of imprisonment for six months of 
arresto mayor,
 as minimum, to six years of 
prision correctional,
 as maximum, and the award of P20,000 as civil indemnity, P30,000 as moral damages, P30,000 as exemplary damages were also correct.
[20]
 We likewise agree with the CA in awarding 6% interest per annum on all the damages awarded from the date of finality of this Decision.
[21]
WHEREFORE,
 we 
DISMISS
 the appeal and 
AFFIRM
 the September 24, 2013 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 05527.
With costs against accused-appellant.
