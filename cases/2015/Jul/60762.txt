ING BANK N.V., ENGAGED IN BANKING OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES AS ING BANK N.V. MANILA BRANCH, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




LEONEN, J.:


Qualified taxpayers with pending tax cases may still avail themselves of the tax amnesty program under Republic Act No. 9480,
[1]
 otherwise known as the 2007 Tax Amnesty Act. Thus, the provision in BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 19-2008 excepting "[i]ssues and cases which were ruled by any court (even without finality) in favor of the BIR prior to amnesty availment of the taxpayer" from the benefits of the law is illegal, invalid, and null and void.
[2]
 The duty to withhold the tax on compensation arises upon its accrual.
This is a Petition for Review
[3]
 appealing the April 5, 2005 Decision
[4]
 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc, which in turn affirmed the August 9, 2004 Decision
[5]
 and November 12, 2004 Resolution
[6]
 of the Court of Tax Appeals Second Division. The August 9, 2004 Decision held petitioner ING Bank, N.V. Manila Branch (ING Bank) liable for (a) deficiency documentary stamp tax for the taxable years 1996 and 1997 in the total amount of P238,545,052.38 inclusive of surcharges; (b) deficiency onshore tax for the taxable year 1996 in the total amount of P997,333.89 inclusive of surcharges and interest; and (c) deficiency withholding tax on compensation for the taxable years 1996 and 1997 in the total amount of P564,542.67 inclusive of interest. The Resolution denied ING Bank's Motion for Reconsideration.
[7]
While this case was pending before this court, ING Bank filed a Manifestation and Motion
[8]
 stating that it availed itself of the government's tax amnesty program under Republic Act No. 9480 with respect to its deficiency documentary stamp tax and deficiency onshore tax liabilities.
[9]
 What is at issue now is whether ING Bank is entitled to the immunities and privileges under Republic Act No. 9480, and whether the assessment for deficiency withholding tax on compensation is proper.
ING Bank, "the Philippine branch of Internationale Nederlanden Bank N.V., a foreign banking corporation incorporated in the Netherlands[,] is duly authorized by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to operate as a branch with full banking authority in the Philippines."
[10]
On January 3, 2000, ING Bank received a Final Assessment Notice
[11]
 dated December 3, 1999.
[12]
 The Final Assessment Notice also contained the Details of Assessment
[13]
 and 13 Assessment Notices issued by the Enforcement Service of the Bureau of Internal Revenue through its Assistant Commissioner Percival T. Salazar[.]
[14]
 The Final Assessment Notice covered the following deficiency tax assessments for taxable years 1996 and 1997:

On February 2, 2000, ING Bank "paid the deficiency assessments for [the] 1996 compromise penalty, 1997 deficiency documentary stamp tax and 1997 deficiency final tax in the respective amounts of P1,000.00, P1,000.00 and P75,013.25 [the original amount of P73,752.47 plus additional interest]."
[16]
 ING Bank, however, "protested [on the same day] the remaining ten (10) deficiency tax assessments in the total amount of P672,576,939.18."
[17]
ING Bank filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Tax Appeals on October 26, 2000. This case was docketed as C.T.A. Case No. 6187.
[18]
 The Petition was filed to seek "the cancellation and withdrawal of the deficiency tax assessments for the years 1996 and 1997, including the alleged deficiency documentary stamp tax on special savings accounts, deficiency onshore tax, and deficiency withholding tax on compensation mentioned above."
[19]
After trial, the Court of Tax Appeals Second Division rendered its Decision on August 9, 2004, with the following disposition:
WHEREFORE,
 the assessments for 1996 and 1997 deficiency income tax, 1996 and 1997 deficiency branch profit remittance tax and 1997 deficiency documentary stamp tax on IBCLs exceeding five days are hereby CANCELLED and WITHDRAWN. However, the assessments for 1996 and 1997 deficiency withholding tax on compensation, 1996 deficiency onshore tax and 1996 and 1997 deficiency documentary stamp tax on special savings accounts are hereby UPHELD in the following amounts:

Accordingly, petitioner is ORDERED to PAY the respondent the aggregate amount of P240,106,928.94, plus 20% delinquency interest per annum from February 3, 2000 until fully paid, pursuant to Section 249(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.
SO ORDERED.
[20]
 (Emphasis in the original)
Both the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and ING Bank filed their respective Motions for Reconsideration.
[21]
 Both Motions were denied through the Second Division's Resolution dated November 12, 2004, as follows:
WHEREFORE,
 the respondent's Motion for Partial Reconsideration and the petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration are hereby 
DENIED
 for lack of merit. The pronouncement reached in the assailed decision is 
REITERATED
.
SO ORDERED.
[22]
On December 8, 2004, ING Bank filed its appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc.
[23]
 The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc denied due course to ING Bank's Petition for Review and dismissed the same for lack of merit in the Decision promulgated on April 5, 2005.
[24]
Hence, ING Bank filed its Petition for Review
[25]
 before this court. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed its Comment
[26]
 on October 5, 2005 and ING Bank its Reply
[27]
 on December 14, 2005. Pursuant to this court's Resolution
[28]
 dated January 25, 2006, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed its Manifestation and Motion
[29]
 on February 14, 2006, stating that it is adopting its Comment as its Memorandum, and ING Bank filed its Memorandum
[30]
 on March 9, 2006.
On December 20, 2007, ING Bank filed a Manifestation and Motion
[31]
 informing this court that it had availed itself of the tax amnesty authorized and granted under Republic Act No. 9480 covering "all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, that have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005 [,]"
[32]
 ING Bank stated that it filed before the Bureau of Internal Revenue its Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty Under Republic Act No. 9480
[33]
 on December 14, 2007, together with the following documents:
(1) 
Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005 (original and amended declarations);
[34]
(2)
 Tax Amnesty Return For Taxable Year 2005 and Prior Years (BIRFormNo. 2116);
[35]
 and
(3)
 Tax Amnesty Payment Form (Acceptance of Payment Form) for Taxable Year 2005 and Prior Years (BIR Form No. 0617)
[36]
 showing payment of the amnesty tax in the amount of P500,000.00.
ING Bank prayed that this court issue a resolution taking note of its availment of the tax amnesty, and confirming its entitlement to all the immunities and privileges under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9480, particularly with respect to the "payment of deficiency documentary stamp taxes on its special savings accounts for the taxable years 1996 and 1997 and deficiency tax on onshore interest income derived under the foreign currency deposit system for taxable year 1996[.]"
[37]
Pursuant to this court's Resolution
[38]
 dated January 23, 2008, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed its Comment
[39]
 and ING Bank, its Reply.
[40]
Originally, ING Bank raised the following issues in its pleadings:
First, whether "[t]he Court of Tax Appeals En Banc erred in concluding that petitioner's Special Saving Accounts are subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) as certificates of deposit under Section 180 of the 1977 Tax Code";
[41]
Second, whether "[t]he Court of Tax Appeals En Banc erred in holding petitioner liable for deficiency onshore tax considering that under the 1977 Tax Code and the pertinent revenue regulations, the obligation to pay the ten percent (10%) final tax on onshore interest income rests on the payors-borrowers and not on petitioner as payee-lender";
[42]
 and
Third, whether "[t]he Court of Tax Appeals En Banc erred in holding petitioner liable for deficiency withholding tax on compensation for the accrued bonuses in the taxable years 1996 and 1997 considering that these were not distributed to petitioner's officers and employees during those taxable years, hence, were not yet subject to withholding tax."
[43]
However, ING Bank availed itself of the tax amnesty under Republic Act No. 9480, with respect to its liabilities for deficiency documentary stamp taxes on its special savings accounts for the taxable years 1996 and 1997 and deficiency tax on onshore interest income under the foreign currency deposit system for taxable year 1996.
Consequently, the issues now for resolution are:
First, whether petitioner ING Bank may validly avail itself of the tax amnesty granted by Republic Act No. 9480; and
Second, whether petitioner ING Bank is liable for deficiency withholding tax on accrued bonuses for the taxable years 1996 and 1997.
Tax amnesty availment
Petitioner ING Bank asserts that it is "qualified to avail of the tax amnesty under Section 5 [of Republic Act No. 9480] and not disqualified under Section 8 [of the same law]."
[44]
Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue, for its part, does not deny the authenticity of the documents submitted by petitioner ING Bank or dispute the payment of the amnesty tax. However, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue claims that petitioner ING Bank is not qualified to avail itself of the tax amnesty granted under Republic Act No. 9480 because both the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc and Second Division ruled in its favor that confirmed the liability of petitioner ING Bank for deficiency documentary stamp taxes, onshore taxes, and withholding taxes.
[45]
Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserts that BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 19-2008 specifically excludes "cases which were ruled by any court (
even without finality
) in favor of the BIR prior to amnesty availment of the taxpayer" from the coverage of the tax amnesty under Republic Act No. 9480.
[46]
 In any case, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue argues that petitioner ING Bank's availment of the tax amnesty is still subject to its evaluation,
[47]
 that it is "empowered to exercise [its] sound discretion in the implementation of a tax amnesty in favor of a taxpayer,"
[48]
 and "petitioner cannot presume that its application . . . would be granted[.]"
[49]
 Accordingly, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue prays that "petitioner [ING Bank's] motion be denied for lack of merit."
[50]
Petitioner ING Bank counters that BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 19-2008 cannot override Republic Act No. 9480 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, which only exclude from tax amnesty "
tax cases subject of final and [executory] judgment by the courts
."
[51]
Petitioner ING Bank asserts that its full compliance with the conditions prescribed in Republic Act No. 9480 (the conditions being submission of the requisite documents and payment of the amnesty tax), which respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue does not dispute, confirms that it is "qualified to avail itself, and has actually availed itself, of the tax amnesty."
[52]
 It argues that there is nothing in the law that gives respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue the discretion to rescind or erase the legal effects of its tax amnesty availment.
[53]
 Thus, the issue is no longer about whether "[it] is entitled to avail itself of the tax amnesty[,]"
[54]
 but rather whether the effects of its tax amnesty availment extend to the assessments of deficiency documentary stamp taxes on its special savings accounts for 1996 and 1997 and deficiency tax on onshore interest income for 1996.
[55]
Petitioner ING Bank points out the Court of Tax Appeals' ruling in 
Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[56]
 to the effect that full compliance with the requirements of the tax amnesty law extinguishes the tax deficiencies subject of the amnesty availment.
[57]
 Thus, with its availment of the tax amnesty and full compliance with all the conditions prescribed in the statute, petitioner ING Bank asserts that it is entitled to all the immunities and privileges under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9480.
[58]
Withholding tax on compensation
Petitioner ING Bank claims that it is not liable for withholding taxes on bonuses accruing to its officers and employees during taxable years 1996 and 1997.
[59]
 It maintains its position that the liability of the employer to withhold the tax does not arise until such bonus is actually distributed. It cites Section 72 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code, which states that "[e]very employer 
making payment of wages
 shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax," and BIR Ruling No. 555-88 (November 23, 1988) declaring that "[t]he withholding tax on the bonuses should be deducted upon the distribution of the same to the officers and employees[.]"
[60]
 ( Since the supposed bonuses were not distributed to the officers and employees in 1996 and 1997 but were distributed in the succeeding year when the amounts of the bonuses were finally determined, petitioner ING Bank asserts that its duty as employer to withhold the tax during these taxable years did not arise.
[61]
Petitioner ING Bank further argues that the Court of Tax Appeals' discussion on Section 29(j) of the 1993 National Internal Revenue Code and Section 3 of Revenue Regulations No. 8-90 is not applicable because the issue in this case "is not whether the accrued bonuses should be allowed as deductions from petitioner's taxable income but, rather, whether the accrued bonuses are subject to withholding tax on compensation in the respective years of accrual[.]"
[62]
Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue counters that petitioner ING Bank's application of BIR Ruling No. 555-88 is misplaced because as found by the Second Division of the Court of Tax Appeals, the factual milieu is different:
[63]
In that ruling, bonuses are determined and distributed in the succeeding year "[A]fter [sic] the audit of each company is completed (on or before April 15 of the succeeding year)". The withholding and remittance of income taxes were also made in the year they were distributed to the employees. . . .
In petitioner's case, bonuses were determined during the year but were distributed in the succeeding year. No withholding of income tax was effected but the bonuses were claimed as an expense for the year. . . .
Since the bonuses were not subjected to withholding tax during the year they were claimed as an expense, the same should be disallowed pursuant to the above-quoted law.
[64]
Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue contends that petitioner ING Bank's act of "claim[ing] [the] subject bonuses as deductible expenses in its taxable income although it has not yet withheld and remitted the [corresponding withholding] tax"
[65]
 to the Bureau of Internal Revenue contravened Section 29(j) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
[66]
 Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue claims that "subject bonuses should also be disallowed as deductible expenses of petitioner."
[67]
I
Taxpayers with pending tax cases may avail themselves of the tax amnesty program under Republic Act No. 9480.
In 
CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[68]
 this court has "definitively declare[d] . . . the exception '[i]ssues and cases which were ruled by any court (even without finality) in favor of the BIR prior to amnesty availment of the taxpayer' under BIR [Revenue Memorandum Circular No.] 19-2008 [as] invalid, [for going] beyond the scope of the provisions of the 2007 Tax Amnesty Law."
[69]
 Thus:
[N]either the law nor the implementing rules state that a court ruling that has not attained finality would preclude the availment of the benefits of the Tax Amnesty Law. Both R.A. 9480 and DOF Order No. 29-07 are quite precise in declaring that "[t]ax cases 
subject of final and executory judgment
 by the courts" are the ones excepted from the benefits of the law. In fact, we have already pointed out the erroneous interpretation of the law in 
Philippine Banking Corporation (Now: Global Business Bank, Inc.) v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, viz
:
The BIR's 
inclusion of "issues and cases which were ruled by any court (even without finality) in favor of the BIR prior to amnesty availment of the taxpayer" as one of the exceptions
 in RMC 19-2008 is 
misplaced
. RA 9480 is specifically clear that the exceptions to the tax amnesty program include "tax cases subject of final and executory judgment by the courts." The present case has not become final and executory when Metrobank availed of the tax amnesty program.
[70]
 (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)
Moreover, in the fairly recent case of 
LG Electronics Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[71]
 we confirmed that only cases that involve final and executory judgments are excluded from the tax amnesty program as explicitly provided under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 9480.
[72]
Thus, petitioner ING Bank is not disqualified from availing itself of the tax amnesty under the law during the pendency of its appeal before this court.
II
Petitioner ING Bank showed that it complied with the requirements set forth under Republic Act No. 9480. Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue never questioned or rebutted that petitioner ING Bank fully complied with the requirements for tax amnesty under the law. Moreover, the contestability period of one (1) year from the time of petitioner ING Bank's availment of the tax amnesty law on December 14, 2007 lapsed. Correspondingly, it is fully entitled to the immunities and privileges mentioned under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 9480. This is clear from the following provisions:
SEC. 2. 
Availment of the Amnesty. - Any person, natural or juridical, who wishes to avail himself of the tax amnesty authorized and granted under this Act shall file with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) a notice and Tax Amnesty Return accompanied by a Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005, in such form as may be prescribed in the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of this Act, and pay the applicable amnesty tax within six months from the effectivity of the IRR.
SEC. 4. 
Presumption of Correctness of the SALN
. - The SALN as of December 31. 2005 shall be considered as true and correct except where the amount of declared networth is understated to the extent of thirty percent (30%) or more as may be established in proceedings initiated by, or at the instance of, parties other than the BIR or its agents: Provided, 
That such proceedings must be initiated within one year following the date of the filing of the tax amnesty return and the SALN
. Findings of or admission in congressional hearings, other administrative agencies of government, and/or courts shall be admissible to prove a thirty percent (30%) under-declaration.
. . .                    . . .                    . . .
SEC. 6. 
Immunities and Privileges. - Those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty under Section 5 hereof and have fully complied with all its conditions shall be entitled to the following immunities and privileges
:
The taxpayer shall be immune from the payment of taxes, as well as addition thereto, and the appurtenant civil, criminal or administrative penalties under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, arising from, the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years.
The taxpayer's Tax Amnesty Returns and the SALN as of December 31, 2005 shall not be admissible as evidence in all proceedings that pertain to taxable year 2005 and prior years, insofar as such proceedings relate to internal revenue taxes, before judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative bodies in which he is a defendant or respondent, and except for the purpose of ascertaining the networth beginning January 1. 2006, the same shall not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person or government office. However, the taxpayer may use this as a defense, whenever appropriate, in cases brought against him.
The books of accounts and other records of the taxpayer for the years covered by the tax amnesty availed of shall not be examined: Provided, That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may authorize in writing the examination of the said books of accounts and other records to verify the validity or correctness of a claim for any tax refund, tax credit (other than refund or credit of taxes withheld on wages), tax incentives, and/or exemptions under existing laws. (Emphasis supplied)
Contrary to respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue's stance, Republic Act No. 9480 confers no discretion on respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The provisions of the law are plain and simple. Unlike the power to compromise or abate a taxpayer's liability under Section 204
[73]
 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code that is within the discretion of respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
[74]
 its authority under Republic Act No. 9480 is limited to determining whether (a) the taxpayer is qualified to avail oneself of the tax amnesty; (b) all the requirements for availment under the law were complied with; and (c) the correct amount of amnesty tax was paid within the period prescribed by law. There is nothing in Republic Act No. 9480 which can be construed as authority for respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue to introduce exceptions and/or conditions to the coverage of the law nor to disregard its provisions and substitute his own personal judgment.
Republic Act No. 9480 provides a general grant of tax amnesty subject only to the cases 
specifically
 excepted by it. A tax amnesty "partakes of an 
absolute
 . . . waiver by the Government of its right to collect what otherwise would be due it[.]"
[75]
 The effect of a qualified taxpayer's submission of the required documents and the payment of the prescribed amnesty tax was immunity from payment of all national internal revenue taxes as well as all administrative, civil, and criminal liabilities founded upon or arising from non-payment of national internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior taxable years.
[76]
Finally, the documentary stamp tax and onshore income tax are covered by the tax amnesty program under Republic Act No. 9480 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.
[77]
 Moreover, as to the deficiency tax on onshore interest income, it is worthy to state that petitioner ING Bank was assessed by respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue, not as a withholding agent, but as one that was directly liable for the tax on onshore interest income and failed to pay the same.
Considering petitioner ING Bank's tax amnesty availment, there is no more issue regarding its liability for deficiency documentary stamp taxes on its special savings accounts for 1996 and 1997 and deficiency tax on onshore interest income for 1996, including surcharge and interest.
III.
The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc affirmed the factual finding of the Second Division that accrued bonuses were recorded in petitioner ING Bank's books as expenses for taxable years 1996 and 1997, although no withholding of tax was effected:
With the preceding defense notwithstanding, petitioner now maintained that the portion of the disallowed bonuses in the amounts of P3,879,407.85 and P9,004,402.63 for the respective years 1996 and 1997, were actually payments for reimbursements of representation, travel and entertainment expenses of its officers. These expenses according to petitioner are not considered compensation of employees and likewise not subject to withholding tax.
In order to prove that the discrepancy in the accrued bonuses represents reimbursement of expenses, petitioner availed of the services of an independent CPA pursuant to CTA Circular No. 1-95, as amended. As a consequence, Mr. Ruben Rubio was commissioned by the court to verify the accuracy of petitioner's position and to check its supporting documents.
In a report dated January 29, 2002. the commissioned independent CPA noted the following pertinent findings: . . .

Section 29.

; travelling expenses while away from home in the pursuit of a trade, profession or business, rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession, for the purpose of the trade, profession or business, of property to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or in which he has no equity.

Any amount

[81]
 and 74
[82]
 of this Code
. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 3 of Revenue Regulations No. 8-90 (now Section 2.58.5 of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98) provides:
Section 3. Section 9 of Revenue Regulations No. 6-85 is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 9. (a) 
Requirement for deductibility
. Any income payment, which is otherwise deductible under Sections 29 and 54 of the Tax Code, as amended, 
shall be allowed as a deduction from the payor s gross income only if it is shown that the tax required to be withheld has been paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue in accordance with Sections 50, 51, 72, and 74 also of the Tax Code
. (Emphasis supplied)
Under the National Internal Revenue Code, every form of compensation for personal services is subject to income tax and, consequently, to withholding tax. The term "compensation" means all remunerations paid for services performed by an employee for his or her employer, whether paid in cash or in kind, unless specifically excluded under Sections 32(B)
[83]
 and 78(A)
[84]
 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code.
[85]
 The name designated to the remuneration for services is immaterial. Thus, "salaries, wages, emoluments and honoraria, bonuses, allowances (such as transportation, representation, entertainment, and the like), [taxable] fringe benefits [,] pensions and retirement pay, and other income of a similar nature constitute compensation income"
[86]
 that is taxable.
Hence, petitioner ING Bank is liable for the withholding tax on the bonuses since it claimed the same as expenses in the year they were accrued.
Petitioner ING Bank insists, however, that the bonus accruals in 1996 and 1997 were not yet subject to withholding tax because these bonuses were actually distributed only in the succeeding years of their accrual (i.e., in 1997 and 1998) when the amounts were finally determined.
Petitioner ING Bank's contention is untenable.
The tax on compensation income is withheld at source under the creditable withholding tax system wherein the tax withheld is intended to equal or 
at least approximate the tax due
 of the payee on the said income. It was designed to enable (a) the individual taxpayer to meet his or her income tax liability on compensation 
earned
; and (b) the government to collect at source the appropriate taxes on compensation.
[87]
 Taxes withheld are creditable in nature.
[88]
 Thus, the employee is still required to file an income tax return to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income.
[89]
 For over withholding, the employee is refunded.
[90]
 Therefore, absolute or exact accuracy in the determination of the amount of the compensation income is not a prerequisite for the employer's withholding obligation to arise.
It is true that the law and implementing regulations require the employer to deduct and pay the income tax on compensation paid to its employees, either actually or constructively.
Section 72 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code, as amended,
[91]
 states:
SECTION 72. 
Income tax collected at source
. â (a) 
Requirement of withholding
. â 
Every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold, upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with regulations to be prepared and promulgated by the Minister of Finance
. (Emphasis supplied)
Sections 7 and 14 of Revenue Regulations No. 6-82,
[92]
 as amended,
[93]
 relative to the withholding of tax on compensation income, provide:
Section 7. 
Requirement of withholding.
 â Every employer or any person who pays or controls the payment of compensation to an employee, whether resident citizen or alien, non-resident citizen, or nonÂ­resident alien engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, must withhold from such compensation paid, an amount computed in accordance with these regulations.
I. Withholding of tax on compensation paid to resident employees. â (a) 
In general, every employer making payment of compensation shall deduct and withhold from such compensation income for the entire calendar year, a tax determined in accordance with the prescribed new Withholding Tax Tables effective January 1, 1992 (ANNEX "A")
.
Section 14. 
Liability for the Tax.
 â 
The employer is required to collect the tax by deducting and withholding the amount thereof from the employee's compensation as when paid, either actually or constructively
. An employer is required to deduct and withhold the tax notwithstanding that the compensation is paid in something other than money (for example, compensation paid in stocks or bonds) and to pay the tax to the collecting officer. If compensation is paid in property other than money, the employer should make necessary arrangements to ensure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is available for payment to the collecting officer.
Every person required to deduct and withhold the tax from the compensation of an employee is liable for the payment of such tax whether or not collected from the employee
. If, for example, the employer deducts less than the correct amount of tax, or if he fails to deduct any part of the tax, he is nevertheless liable for the correct amount of the tax. However, if the employer in violation of the provisions of Chapter XI, Title II of the Tax Code fails to deduct and withhold and thereafter the employee pays the tax, it shall no longer be collected from the employer. Such payment does not, however, operate to relieve the employer from liability for penalties or additions to the tax for failure to deduct and withhold within the time prescribed by law or regulations. The employer will not be relieved of his liability for payment of the tax required to be withheld unless he can show that the tax has been paid by the employee.
The amount of any tax withheld/collected by the employer is a special fund in trust for the Government of the Philippines.
When the employer or other person required to deduct and withhold the tax under this Chapter XI, Title II of the Tax Code has withheld and paid such tax to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or to any authorized collecting officer, then such employer or person shall be relieved of any liability to any person. (Emphasis supplied)
Constructive payment of compensation is further defined in Revenue Regulations No. 6-82:
Section 25. 
Applicability; constructive receipt of compensation.
Compensation is constructively paid within the meaning of these regulations when it is credited to the account of or set apart for an employee so that it may be drawn upon by him at any time although not then actually reduced to possession
. To constitute payment in such a case, the compensation must be credited or set apart for the employee without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and must be made available to him so that it may be drawn upon at any time, and its payment brought within his control and disposition. (Emphasis supplied)
On the other hand, it is also true that under Section 45 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (then Section 39 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code, as amended), deductions from gross income are taken for the taxable year in which "paid or accrued" or "paid or incurred" is dependent upon the method of accounting income and expenses adopted by the taxpayer.
In 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Isabela Cultural Corporation
,
[94]
 this court explained the accrual method of accounting, as against the cash method:
Accounting methods for tax purposes comprise a set of rules for determining when and how to report income and deductions.
Revenue Audit Memorandum Order No. 1-2000, provides that under the accrual method of accounting, expenses not being claimed as deductions by a taxpayer in the current year when they are incurred cannot be claimed as deduction from income for the succeeding year. Thus, a taxpayer who is authorized to deduct certain expenses and other allowable deductions for the current year but failed to do so cannot deduct the same for the next year.
The accrual method relies upon the taxpayer's right to receive amounts or its obligation to pay them, in opposition to actual receipt or payment, which characterizes the cash method of accounting. Amounts of income accrue where the right to receive them become fixed, where there is created an enforceable liability. Similarly, liabilities are accrued when fixed and determinable in amount, without regard to indeterminacy merely of time of payment.
For a taxpayer using the accrual method, the determinative question is, when do the facts present themselves in such a manner that the taxpayer must recognize income or expense? 
The accrual of income and expense is permitted when the all-events test has been met. This test requires: (1) fixing of a right to income or liability to pay; and (2) the availability of the reasonable accurate determination of such income or liability
.
The all-events test requires the right to income or liability be fixed, and the amount of such income or liability be determined with reasonable accuracy. However, the test does not demand that the amount of income or liability be known absolutely only that a taxpayer has at his disposal the information necessary to compute the amount with reasonable accuracy
. The all-events test is satisfied where computation remains uncertain, if its basis is unchangeable; the test is satisfied where a computation may be unknown, but is not as much as unknowable, within the taxable year. The amount of liability does not have to be determined exactly; it must be determined with "reasonable accuracy." Accordingly, the term "reasonable accuracy" implies something less than an exact or completely accurate amount.
[95]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)
Thus, if the taxpayer is on cash basis, the expense is deductible in the year it was paid, regardless of the year it was incurred. If he is on the accrual method, he can deduct the expense upon accrual thereof. An item that is reasonably ascertained as to amount and acknowledged to be due has "accrued"; actual payment is not essential to constitute "expense."
Stated otherwise, an expense is accrued and deducted for tax purposes when (1) the obligation to pay is already fixed; (2) the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy; and, (3) it is already knowable or the taxpayer can reasonably be expected to have known at the closing of its books for the taxable year.
Section 29(j) of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code
[96]
 (Section 34(K) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code) expressly requires, as a condition for deductibility of an expense, that the tax required to be withheld on the amount paid or payable is shown to have been remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue by the taxpayer constituted as a withholding agent of the government.
The provision of Section 72 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code (Section 79 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code) regarding withholding on wages must be read and construed in harmony with Section 29(j) of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code (Section 34(K) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code) on deductions from gross income. This is in accordance with the rule on statutory construction that an interpretation is to be sought which gives effect to the whole of the statute, such that every part is made effective, harmonious, and sensible,
[97]
 if possible, and not defeated nor rendered insignificant, meaningless, and nugatory.
[98]
 If we go by the theory of petitioner ING Bank, then the condition imposed by Section 29(j) would have been rendered nugatory, or we would in effect have created an exception to this mandatory requirement when there was none in the law.
Reading together the two provisions, we hold that the obligation of the payor/employer to deduct and withhold the related withholding tax arises at the time the income was paid or accrued or recorded as an expense in the payor's/employer's books, whichever comes first.
Petitioner ING Bank accrued or recorded the bonuses as deductible expense in its books. Therefore, its obligation to withhold the related withholding tax due from the deductions for accrued bonuses arose at the time of accrual and not at the time of actual payment.
In 
Filipinas Synthetic Fiber Corporation v. Court of Appeals
,
[99]
 the issue was raised on "whether the liability to withhold tax at source on income payments to non-resident foreign corporations arises upon remittance of the amounts due to the foreign creditors or upon accrual thereof."
[100]
 In resolving this issue, this court considered the nature of the accounting method employed by the withholding agent, which was the accrual method, wherein it was the right to receive income, and not the actual receipt, that determined when to report the amount as part of the taxpayer's gross income.
[101]
 It upheld the lower court's finding that there was already a definite liability on the part of petitioner at the maturity of the loan contracts.
[102]
 Moreover, petitioner already deducted as business expense the said amounts as interests due to the foreign corporation.
[103]
 Consequently, the taxpayer could not claim that there was "no duty to withhold and remit income taxes as yet because the loan contract was not yet due and demandable."
[104]
 Petitioner, "[h]aving written-off the amounts as business expense in its books, had taken advantage of the benefit provided in the law allowing for deductions from gross income."
[105]
Here, petitioner ING Bank already recognized a definite liability on its part considering that it had deducted as business expense from its gross income the accrued bonuses due to its employees. Underlying its accrual of the bonus expense was a reasonable expectation or probability that the bonus would be achieved. In this sense, there was already a constructive payment for income tax purposes as these accrued bonuses were already allotted or made available to its officers and employees.
We note petitioner ING Bank's earlier claim before the Court of Tax Appeals that the bonus accruals in 1996 and 1997 were disbursed in the following year of accrual, as reimbursements of representation, travel, and entertainment expenses incurred by its employees.
[106]
 This shows that the accrued bonuses in the amounts of P400,075.01 (1996) and P1,034,119.43 (1997) on which deficiency withholding taxes of P167,384.97 (1996) and P397,157.70 (1997) were imposed, respectively, were already set apart or made available to petitioner ING Bank's officers and employees. To avoid any tax issue, petitioner ING Bank should likewise have recognized the withholding tax liabilities associated with the bonuses at the time of accrual.
WHEREFORE,
 the Petition is 
PARTLY GRANTED
. The assessments with respect to petitioner ING Bank's liabilities for deficiency documentary stamp taxes on its special savings accounts for the taxable years 1996 and 1997 and deficiency tax on onshore interest income under the foreign currency deposit system for taxable year 1996 are hereby 
SET ASIDE
 solely in view of petitioner ING Bank's availment of the tax amnesty program under Republic Act No. 9480. The April 5, 2005 Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc, which affirmed the August 9, 2004 Decision and November 12, 2004 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals Second Division holding petitioner ING Bank liable for deficiency withholding tax on compensation for the taxable years 1996 and 1997 in the total amount of P564,542.67 inclusive of interest, is

, Congressional Record, 2
nd
 Cong., 1
st
 Session, Vol. I, No. 74, May 10, 1950, p. 2227: "The withholding tax system was first proposed on May 2, 1950 under House Bill (HB) No. 1127. The two main justifications for the proposal were that: first, it will provide a convenient manner for meeting the employee's income tax liability on wages and, second, it will assure the Government of the collection of the income tax on wages which otherwise would have been lost or substantially reduced through failure of the employees concerned to file the corresponding income tax returns. The proponents deemed it necessary to put the system in place for the reason that there are a large number of cases where an employee fails to file an income tax return (ITR) and/or pay the income tax for the 'simple reason that he/she did not set aside from his/her income sufficient amounts to meet his/her tax liability payable the following year.' Withholding of the tax on wages when these are earned was seen as the solution to the problem."
