PERALTA, J.:


Before the Court is a petition for 
certiorari
 and prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by the officers and members of the Philippine Public Health Association, Inc. (
PPHAI
) assailing the validity of Joint Circular No. 1
[1]
 dated November 29, 2012 of the Department of Budget and Management (
DBM
) and the Department of Health (
DOH
) as well as Item 6.5 of the Joint Circular
[2]
 dated September 3, 2012 of the DBM and the Civil Service Commission (
CSC
).
The antecedent facts are as follows:
On March 26, 1992, Republic Act (RA) No. 7305, otherwise known as 
The Magna Carta of Public Health Workers
 was signed into law in order to promote the social and economic well-being of health workers, their living and working conditions and terms of employment, to develop their skills and capabilities to be better equipped to deliver health projects and programs, and to encourage those with proper qualifications and excellent abilities to join and remain in government service.
[3]
 Accordingly, public health workers (
PHWs
) were granted the following allowances and benefits, among others:
Section 20. Additional Compensation. - Notwithstanding Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758, public health workers shall receive the following allowances: hazard allowance, subsistence allowance, longevity pay, laundry allowance and remote assignment allowance.
Section 21. 
Hazard Allowance.
 - Public health workers in hospitals, sanitaria, rural health units, main health centers, health infirmaries, barangay health stations, clinics and other health-related establishments located in difficult areas, strife-torn or embattled areas, distressed or isolated stations, prisons camps, mental hospitals, radiation-exposed clinics, laboratories or disease-infested areas or in areas declared under state of calamity or emergency for the duration thereof which expose them to great danger, contagion, radiation, volcanic activity/eruption, occupational risks or perils to life as determined by the Secretary of Health or the Head of the unit with the approval of the Secretary of Health, shall be compensated hazard allowances equivalent to at least 
twenty-five percent (25%)
 of the monthly basic salary of health workers receiving 
salary grade 19 and below
, and 
five percent (5%)
 for health workers with 
salary grade 20 and above
.
Section 22. 
Subsistence Allowance.
 - Public health workers who are required to render service within the premises of hospitals, sanitaria, health infirmaries, main health centers, rural health units and barangay health stations, or clinics, and other health-related establishments in order to make their services available at any and all times, shall be entitled to full subsistence allowance of 
three (3) meals which may be computed in accordance with prevailing circumstances as determined by the Secretary of Health
 in consultation with the Management-Health Worker's Consultative Councils, as established under Section 33 of this Act: 
Provided
, That representation and travel allowance shall be given to rural health physicians as enjoyed by municipal agriculturists, municipal planning and development officers and budget officers.
Section 23. 
Longevity Pay.
 - A monthly longevity pay equivalent 
to five percent (5%)
 of the monthly basic pay shall be paid to a health worker 
for every five (5) years of continuous, efficient and meritorious services
 rendered as certified by the chief of office concerned, commencing with the service after the approval of this Act.
[4]
Pursuant to Section 35
[5]
 of the 
Magna Carta
, the Secretary of Health promulgated its Implementing Rules and Regulations (
IRR
) in July 1992. Thereafter, in November 1999, the DOH, in collaboration with various government agencies and health workers' organizations, promulgated a Revised IRR consolidating all additional and clarificatory rules issued by the former Secretaries of Health dating back from the effectivity of the 
Magna Carta
. The pertinent provisions of said Revised IRR provide:
6.3. 
Longevity Pay.
 â A monthly longevity pay equivalent to 
five percent (5%)
 of the present monthly basic pay shall be paid to public health workers 
for every five (5) years of continuous, efficient and meritorious services
 rendered as certified by the Head of Agency/Local Chief Executives commencing after the approval of the Act. (April 17, 1992)
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
7.1.1. Eligibility to Receive 
Hazard Pay
. â All public health workers covered under RA 7305 are eligible to receive hazard pay 
when the nature of their work exposes them to high risk/low risk hazards for at least fifty percent (50%) of their working hours
 as determined and approved by the Secretary of Health or his authorized representatives.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx 
7.2.1. Eligibility for 
Subsistence Allowance
a. All public health workers covered under RA 7305 are eligible to receive full subsistence allowance 
as long as they render actual duty
.
b. Public Health Workers shall be entitled to full Subsistence Allowance of 
three (3) meals which may be computed in accordance with prevailing circumstances as determined by the Secretary of Health
 in consultation with the Management-Health Workers Consultative Council, as established under Section 33 of the Act.
c. Those public health workers who are out of station shall be entitled to per diems in place of Subsistence Allowance. Subsistence Allowance may also be commuted.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
7.2.3 Rates of Subsistence Allowance
a. Subsistence allowance shall be implemented 
at not less than PhP50.00 per day
 or PhP1,500.00 per month as certified by head of agency.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
d. 
Part-time public health workers
/consultants are 
entitled to one-half (1/2)
 of the prescribed rates received by full-time public health workers.
[6]
On July 28, 2008, the Fourteenth Congress issued Joint Resolution No. 4, entitled 
Joint Resolution Authorizing the President of the Philippines to Modify the Compensation and Position Classification System of Civilian Personnel and the Base Pay Schedule of Military and Uniformed Personnel in the Government, and for other Purposes
, approved by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on June 17, 2009, which provided for certain amendments in the 
Magna Carta
 and its IRR.
On September 3, 2012, respondents DBM and CSC issued one of the two assailed issuances, DBM-CSC Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, to prescribe the rules on the grant of Step Increments due to meritorious performance and Step Increment due to length of service.
[7]
 Specifically, it provided that "an official or employee authorized to be granted Longevity Pay under an existing law is not eligible for the grant of Step Increment due to length of service."
[8]
Shortly thereafter, on November 29, 2012, respondents DBM and DOH then circulated the other assailed issuance, DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, the relevant provisions of which state:
7.0. 
Hazard Pay.
 - Hazard pay is an additional compensation for performing hazardous duties and for enduring physical hardships in the course of performance of duties.
As a general compensation policy, and in line with Section 21 of R. A. No. 7305, Hazard Pay may be granted to PHWs 
only if the nature of the duties and responsibilities of their positions, their actual services, and location of work expose them to great danger, occupational risks, perils of life, and physical hardships; and only during periods of actual exposure to hazards and hardships
.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
8.3 The 
Subsistence Allowance
 shall be 
P50
 for each day of actual full-time service, or 
P25
 for each day of actual part-time service.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
9.0 
Longevity Pay (LP)
9.1 Pursuant to Section 23 of R. A. No. 7305, a PHW may be granted LP at 5% of his/her current monthly basic salary, in recognition of every 5 years of continuous, efficient, and meritorious services rendered as PHW. The grant thereof is based on the following criteria:
9.1.1 
The PHW holds a position in the agency plantilla of regular positions;
 and
9.1.2 He/She has rendered at least satisfactory performance and has not been found guilty of any administrative or criminal case within all rating periods covered by the 5-year period.
In a letter
[9]
 dated January 23, 2013 addressed to respondents Secretary of Budget and Management and Secretary of Health, petitioners expressed their opposition to the Joint Circular cited above on the ground that the same diminishes the benefits granted by the 
Magna Carta
 to PHWs.
Unsatisfied, petitioners, on May 30, 2013, filed the instant petition raising the following issues:
I.
WHETHER RESPONDENTS ENRIQUE T. ONA AND FLORENCIO B. ABAD ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND VIOLATED SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS WHEN THEY ISSUED DBM-DOH JOINT CIRCULAR NO. 1, S. 2012 WHICH:
A) 
MADE THE PAYMENT OF HAZARD PAY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTUAL DAYS OF EXPOSURE TO THE RISK INVOLVED;
B)
 ALLOWED PAYMENT OF SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE AT P50 FOR EACH DAY OF ACTUAL FULL-TIME SERVICE OR P25 FOR EACH DAY OF ACTUAL PART-TIME SERVICE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES AS DETERMINED BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH IN CONSULTATION WITH THE MANAGEMENT HEALTH WORKERS' CONSULTATIVE COUNCILS;
C) 
REQUIRED THAT LONGEVITY PAY BE GRANTED ONLY TO PHWs WHO HOLD PLANTILLA AND REGULAR POSITIONS; AND
D) 
MADE THE JOINT CIRCULAR EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013, BARELY THREE (3) DAYS AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED IN A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION ON DECEMBER 29, 2012, IN VIOLATION OF THE RULES ON PUBLICATION.
II.
WHETHER RESPONDENTS FRANCISCO T. DUQUE AND FLORENCIO B. ABAD ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN THEY ISSUED DBM-CSC JOINT CIRCULAR NO. 1, S. 2012 DATED SEPTEMBER 2, 2012 WHICH PROVIDED THAT AN OFFICIAL OR EMPLOYEE ENTITLED TO LONGEVITY PAY UNDER EXISTING LAW SHALL NO LONGER BE GRANTED STEP INCREMENT DUE TO LENGTH OF SERVICE.
III.
WHETHER RESPONDENTS' ISSUANCE OF DBM-DOH JOINT CIRCULAR NO. 1, S. 2012 IS NULL AND VOID FOR BEING AN UNDUE EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER BY ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES WHEN RESPONDENT ONA ALLOWED RESPONDENT ABAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY SHARE THE POWER TO FORMULATE AND PREPARE THE NECESSARY RULES AND REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE MAGNA CARTA.
IV.
WHETHER RESPONDENT ONA WAS REMISS IN IMPLEMENTING THE MANDATE OF THE MAGNA CARTA WHEN HE DID NOT INCLUDE THE MAGNA CARTA BENEFITS IN THE DEPARTMENT'S YEARLY BUDGET.
V.
WHETHER RESPONDENTS' ISSUANCE OF DBM-DOH JOINT CIRCULAR NO. 1, S. 2012 IS NULL AND VOID FOR BEING AN UNDUE EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER BY ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES WHEN THE SAME WAS ISSUED SANS CONSULTATION WITH PROFESSIONAL AND HEALTH WORKERS' ORGANZATIONS AND UNIONS.
Petitioners contend that respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion when they issued DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012 and DBM-CSC Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012 which prescribe certain requirements on the grant of benefits that are not otherwise required by RA No. 7305. Specifically, petitioners assert that the DBM-DOH Joint Circular grants the payment of Hazard Pay only if the nature of the PHWs' duties expose them to danger when RA No. 7305 does not make any qualification. They likewise claim that said circular unduly fixes Subsistence Allowance at P50 for each day of full-time service and P25 for part-time service which are not in accordance with prevailing circumstances determined by the Secretary of Health as required by RA No. 7305. Moreover, petitioners fault respondents for the premature effectivity of the DBM-DOH Joint Circular which they believe should have been on January 29, 2012 and not on January 1, 2012. As to the grant of Longevity Pay, petitioners posit that the same was wrongfully granted only to PHWs holding regular plantilla positions. Petitioners likewise criticize the DBM-CSC Joint Circular insofar as it withheld the Step Increment due to length of service from those who are already being granted Longevity Pay. As a result, petitioners claim that the subject circulars are void for being an undue exercise of legislative power by administrative bodies.
In their Comment, respondents, through the Solicitor General, refute petitioners' allegations in stating that the assailed circulars were issued within the scope of their authority, and are therefore valid and binding. They also assert the authority of Joint Resolution No. 4, Series of 2009, approved by the President, in accordance with the prescribed procedure. Moreover, respondents question the remedies of 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition used by petitioners for the assailed circulars were done in the exercise of their quasi-legislative, and not of their judicial or quasi-judicial functions.
The petition is partly meritorious.
At the outset, the petition for 
certiorari
 and prohibition filed by petitioners is not the appropriate remedy to assail the validity of respondents' circulars. Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provide:
RULE 65 
CERTIORARI, PROHIBITION AND MANDAMUS
Section 1. 
Petition for certiorari
. - When any tribunal, board or officer 
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions
 has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
Sec. 2. 
Petition for Prohibition
. - When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, 
whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions
, are without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and 
praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein
, or otherwise granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.
[10]
Thus, on the one hand, 
certiorari
 as a special civil action is available only if: (1) it is directed against a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) the tribunal, board, or officer acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[11]
On the other hand, prohibition is available only if: (1) it is directed against a tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person exercising functions, judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial; (2) the tribunal, corporation, board or person acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[12]
 Based on the foregoing, this Court has consistently reiterated that petitions for 
certiorari
 and prohibition may be invoked only against tribunals, corporations, boards, officers, or persons exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, and not against their exercise of legislative or quasi-legislative functions.
[13]
Judicial functions involve the power to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertaking to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties.
[14]
 Quasi-judicial functions apply to the actions and discretion of public administrative officers or bodies required to investigate facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action, in their exercise of discretion of a judicial nature.
[15]
 Ministerial functions are those which an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard to the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.
[16]
Before a tribunal, board, or officer may exercise judicial or quasi-judicial acts, it is necessary that there be a law that gives rise to some specific rights under which adverse claims are made, and the controversy ensuing therefrom is brought before a tribunal, board, or officer clothed with authority to determine the law and adjudicate the respective rights of the contending parties.
[17]
In this case, respondents did not act in any judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial capacity in their issuance of the assailed joint circulars. In issuing and implementing the subject circulars, respondents were not called upon to adjudicate the rights of contending parties to exercise, in any manner, discretion of a judicial nature. The issuance and enforcement by the Secretaries of the DBM, CSC and DOH of the questioned joint circulars were done in the exercise of their quasi-legislative and administrative functions. It was in the nature of subordinate legislation, promulgated by them in their exercise of delegated power. Quasi-legislative power is exercised by administrative agencies through the promulgation of rules and regulations within the confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non-delegation of powers from the separation of the branches of the government.
[18]
Based on the foregoing, 
certiorari
 and prohibition do not lie against herein respondents' issuances. It is beyond the province of 
certiorari
 to declare the aforesaid administrative issuances illegal because petitions for 
certiorari
 seek solely to correct defects in jurisdiction, and not to correct just any error committed by a court, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions unless such court, board, or officer thereby acts without or in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.
[19]
It is likewise beyond the territory of a writ of prohibition since generally, the purpose of the same is to keep a lower court within the limits of its jurisdiction in order to maintain the administration of justice in orderly channels. It affords relief against usurpation of jurisdiction by an inferior court, or when, in the exercise of jurisdiction, the inferior court transgresses the bounds prescribed by the law, or where there is no adequate remedy available in the ordinary course of law.
[20]
Be that as it may, We proceed to discuss the substantive issues raised in the petition in order to finally resolve the doubt over the Joint Circulars' validity. For proper guidance, the pressing issue of whether or not the joint circulars regulating the salaries and benefits relied upon by public health workers were tainted with grave abuse of discretion rightly deserves its prompt resolution.
With respect to the infirmities of the DBM-DOH Joint Circular raised in the petition, they cannot be said to have been issued with grave abuse of discretion for not only are they reasonable, they were likewise issued well within the scope of authority granted to the respondents. In fact, as may be gathered from prior issuances on the matter, the circular did not make any substantial deviation therefrom, but actually remained consistent with, and germane to, the purposes of the law.
First
, the qualification imposed by the DBM-DOH Joint Circular granting the payment of Hazard Pay only if the nature of PHWs' duties expose them to danger and depending on whether the risk involved is high or low was merely derived from Section 7.1.1 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 7305, duly promulgated by the DOH in collaboration with various government health agencies and health workers' organizations in November 1999, to wit:
SECTION 7.1.1. 
Eligibility to Receive Hazard Pay
. â All public health workers covered under RA 7305 are eligible to receive hazard pay 
when the nature of their work exposes them to high risk/low risk hazards for at least fifty percent (50%) of their working hours
 as determined and approved by the Secretary of Health or his authorized representatives.
[21]
Second
, fixing the Subsistence Allowance at P50 for each day of full-time service and P25 for part-time service was also merely a reiteration of the limits prescribed by the Revised IRR, validly issued by the Secretary of Health pursuant to Section 35
[22]
 of RA No. 7305, the pertinent portions of which states:
Section 7.2.3 Rates of Subsistence Allowance
a. Subsistence allowance shall be implemented 
at not less than PhP50.00 per day
 or PhP1,500.00 per month as certified by head of agency.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
d. 
Part-time public health workers
/consultants are 
entitled to one-half (1/2)
 of the prescribed rates received by full-time public health workers.
Third
, the condition imposed by the DBM-DOH Joint Circular granting longevity pay only to those PHWs holding regular plantilla positions merely implements the qualification imposed by the Revised IRR which provides:
6.3. Longevity Pay. â A monthly longevity pay equivalent to five percent (5%) of the present monthly basic pay 
shall be paid to public health workers for every five (5) years of continuous, efficient and meritorious services
 rendered as certified by the Head of Agency/Local Chief Executives commencing after the approval of the Act. (April 17, 1992)
6.3.1. Criteria for Efficient and Meritorious Service A Public Worker shall have:
a. At least a satisfactory performance rating 
within the rating period
.
b. Not been found guilty of any administrative or criminal case within the rating period.
As can be gleaned from the aforequoted provision, petitioners failed to show any real inconsistency in granting longevity pay to PHWs holding regular plantilla positions. Not only are they based on the same premise, but the intent of longevity pay, which is paid to workers for every five (5) years of continuous, efficient and meritorious services, necessarily coincides with that of regularization. Thus, the assailed circular cannot be invalidated for its issuance is consistent with, and germane to, the purposes of the law.
Anent petitioners' contention that the DBM-DOH Joint Circular is null and void for its failure to comply with Section 35
[23]
 of RA No. 7305 providing that its implementing rules shall take effect thirty (30) days after publication in a newspaper of general circulation, as well as its failure to file a copy of the same with the University of the Philippines Law Center-Office of the National Administrative Register (UP Law Center-ONAR), jurisprudence as well as the circumstances of this case dictate otherwise.
Indeed, publication, as a basic postulate of procedural due process, is required by law in order for administrative rules and regulations to be effective.
[24]
 There are, however, several exceptions, one of which are interpretative regulations which "need nothing further than their bare issuance for they give no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed."
[25]
 These regulations need not be published for they add nothing to the law and do not affect substantial rights of any person.
[26]
Thus, in 
Association of Southern Tagalog Electric Cooperatives, et. al. v. Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC)
,
[27]
 wherein several orders issued by the ERC were sought to be invalidated for lack of publication and non-submission of copies thereof to the UP Law Center - ONAR, it has been held that since they merely interpret RA No. 7832 and its IRR, particularly on the computation of the cost of purchased power, without modifying, amending or supplanting the same, they cannot be rendered ineffective, to wit:
When the policy guidelines of the ERC directed the exclusion of discounts extended by power suppliers in the computation of the cost of purchased power, 
the guidelines merely affirmed the plain and unambiguous meaning of "cost" in Section 5, Rule IX of the IRR of R.A. No. 7832
. "Cost" is an item of outlay, and must therefore exclude discounts since these are not amounts paid or charged for the sale of electricity, but are reductions in rates.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
Thus, the policy guidelines of the ERC on the treatment of discounts extended by power suppliers "give no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed." Publication is not necessary for the effectivity of the policy guidelines.
As interpretative regulations, the policy guidelines of the ERC on the treatment of discounts extended by power suppliers are also not required to be filed with the U.P. Law Center in order to be effective.
 Section 4, Chapter 2, Book VII of the Administrative Code of 1987 requires every rule adopted by an agency to be filed with the U.P. Law Center to be effective. However, in 
Board of Trustees of the Government Service Insurance System v. Velasco
, this Court pronounced that "
not all rules and regulations adopted by every government agency are to be filed with the UP Law Center
." 
Interpretative regulations and those merely internal in nature are not required to be filed with the U.P. Law Center.
 Paragraph 9 (a) of the Guidelines for Receiving and Publication of Rules and Regulations Filed with the U.P. Law Center states:
9. Rules and Regulations which need not be filed with the U.P. Law Center, shall, among others, include but not be limited to, the following:
a. Those which are interpretative regulations and those merely internal in nature, that is, regulating only the personnel of the Administrative agency and not the public.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
Furthermore, the policy guidelines of the ERC did not create a new obligation and impose a new duty, nor did it attach a new disability. As previously discussed, the policy guidelines merely interpret R.A. No. 7832 and its IRR, particularly on the computation of the cost of purchased power. The policy guidelines did not modify, amend or supplant the IRR.
Similarly, in 
Republic v. Drugmaker's Laboratories, Inc.
,
[28]
 the validity of circulars issued by the Food and Drug Administration (
FDA
) was upheld in spite of the non-compliance with the publication, prior hearing, and consultation requirements for they merely implemented the provisions of Administrative Order No. 67, entitled "Revised Rules and Regulations on Registration of Pharmaceutical Products" issued by the DOH, in the following wise:
A careful scrutiny of the foregoing issuances would reveal that AO 67, s. 1989 is actually the rule that originally introduced the BA/BE testing requirement as a component of applications for the issuance of CPRs covering certain pharmaceutical products.
 As such, it is considered an administrative regulation - a legislative rule to be exact - issued by the Secretary of Health in consonance with the express authority granted to him by RA 3720 to implement the statutory mandate that all drugs and devices should first be registered with the FDA prior to their manufacture and sale. Considering that neither party contested the validity of its issuance, the Court deems that AO 67, s. 1989 complied with the requirements of prior hearing, notice, and publication pursuant to the presumption of regularity accorded to the government in the exercise of its official duties.42
On the other hand, Circular Nos. 1 and 8, s. 1997 cannot be considered as administrative regulations because they do not: (a) implement a primary legislation by providing the details thereof; (b) interpret, clarify, or explain existing statutory regulations under which the FDA operates; and/or (c) ascertain the existence of certain facts or things upon which the enforcement of RA 3720 depends. In fact, the only purpose of these circulars is for the FDA to administer and supervise the implementation of the provisions of AO 67, s. 1989, including those covering the BA/BE testing requirement, consistent with and pursuant to RA 3720.43 Therefore, the FDA has sufficient authority to issue the said circulars and since they would not affect the substantive rights of the parties that they seek to govern - as they are not, strictly speaking, administrative regulations in the first place -no prior hearing, consultation, and publication are needed for their validity.
In this case, the DBM-DOH Joint Circular in question gives no real consequence more than what the law itself had already prescribed. As previously discussed, the qualification of actual exposure to danger for the PHW's entitlement to hazard pay, the rates of P50 and P25 subsistence allowance, and the entitlement to longevity pay on the basis of PHW's status in the plantilla of regular positions were already prescribed and authorized by pre-existing law. There is really no new obligation or duty imposed by the subject circular for it merely reiterated those embodied in RA No. 7305 and its Revised IRR. The Joint Circular did not modify, amend nor supplant the Revised IRR, the validity of which is undisputed. Consequently, whether it was duly published and filed with the UP Law Center - ONAR is necessarily immaterial to its validity because in view of the pronouncements above, interpretative regulations, such as the DBM-DOH circular herein, need not be published nor filed with the UP Law Center - ONAR in order to be effective. Neither is prior hearing or consultation mandatory.
Nevertheless, it bears stressing that in spite of the immateriality of the publication requirement in this case, and even assuming the necessity of the same, its basic objective in informing the public of the contents of the law was sufficiently accomplished when the DBM-DOH Joint Circular was published in the 
Philippine Star
, a newspaper of general circulation, on December 29, 2012.
[29]
As to petitioners' allegation of grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent DOH Secretary in failing to include the 
Magna Carta
 benefits in his department's yearly budget, the same is belied by the fact that petitioners themselves specifically provided in their petition an account of the amounts allocated for the same in the years 2012 and 2013.
[30]
Based on the foregoing, it must be recalled that administrative regulations., such as the DBM-DOH Joint Circular herein, enacted by administrative agencies to implement and interpret the law they are entrusted to enforce are entitled to great respect.
[31]
 They partake of the nature of a statute and are just as binding as if they have been written in the statute itself. As such, administrative regulations have the force and effect of law and enjoy the presumption of legality. Unless and until they are overcome by sufficient evidence showing that they exceeded the bounds of the law,
[32]
 their validity and legality must be upheld.
Thus, notwithstanding the contention that the Joint Resolution No. 4 promulgated by Congress cannot be a proper source of delegated power, the subject Circular was nevertheless issued well within the scope of authority granted to the respondents. The issue in this case is not whether the Joint Resolution No. 4 can become law and, consequently, authorize the issuance of the regulation in question, but whether the circular can be struck down as invalid for being tainted with grave abuse of discretion. Regardless, therefore, of the validity or invalidity of Joint Resolution No. 4, the DBM-DOH Joint Circular assailed herein cannot be said to have been arbitrarily or capriciously issued for being consistent with prior issuances duly promulgated pursuant to valid and binding law.
Distinction must be made, however, with respect to the DBM-CSC Joint Circular, the contested provision of which states:
6.5 
An official or employee authorized to be granted Longevity Pay under an existing law is not eligible for the grant of Step Increment Due to Length of Service.
A review of RA No. 7305 and its Revised IRR reveals that the law does not similarly impose such condition on the grant of longevity pay to PHWs in the government service. As such, the DBM-CSC Joint Circular effectively created a new imposition which was not otherwise stipulated in the law it sought to interpret. Consequently, the same exception granted to the DBM-DOH Joint Circular cannot be applied to the DBM-CSC Joint Circular insofar as the requirements on publication and submission with the UP Law Center - ONAR are concerned. Thus, while it was well within the authority of the respondents to issue rules regulating the grant of step increments as provided by RA No. 6758, otherwise known as the 
Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989
, which pertinently states:
Section 13. Pay Adjustments. - Paragraphs (b) and (c), Section 15 of Presidential Decree No. 985 are hereby amended to read as follows:
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
(c) 
Step Increments
 - Effective January 1, 1990 step increments shall be granted based on merit and/or length of service 
in accordance with rules and regulations that will be promulgated jointly by the DBM and the Civil Service Commission,
and while it was duly published in the 
Philippine Star
, a newspaper of general circulation, on September 15, 2012,
[33]
 the DBM-CSC Joint Circular remains unenforceable for the failure of respondents to file the same with the UP Law Center - ONAR.
[34]
 Moreover, insofar as the DBM-DOH Joint Circular similarly withholds the Step Increment due to length of service from those who are already being granted Longevity Pay, the same must likewise be declared unenforceable.
[35]
Note also that the DBM-DOH Joint Circular must further be invalidated insofar as it lowers the hazard pay at rates below the minimum prescribed by Section 21 of RA No. 7305 and Section 7.1.5 (a) of its Revised IRR as follows:
SEC. 21. Hazard Allowance. - Public health worker in hospitals, sanitaria, rural health units, main centers, health infirmaries, barangay health stations, clinics and other health-related establishments located in difficult areas, strife-torn or embattled areas, distresses or isolated stations, prisons camps, mental hospitals, radiation-exposed clinics, laboratories or disease-infested areas or in areas declared under state of calamity or emergency for the duration thereof which expose them to great danger, contagion, radiation, volcanic activity/eruption occupational risks or perils to life as determined by the Secretary of Health or the Head of the unit with the approval of the Secretary of Health, shall be compensated hazard allowance equivalent to 
at least
 twenty-five percent 
(25%)
 of the monthly basic salary of health workers receiving salary grade 19 and below, and five percent 
(5%)
 for health workers with salary grade 20 and above.
xxx                    xxx                     xxx
7.1.5. Rates of Hazard Pay
a. Public health workers shall be compensated hazard allowances equivalent to 
at least
 twenty five 
(25%)
 of the monthly basic salary of health workers, receiving salary grade 19 and below, and five percent 
(5%)
 for health workers with salary grade 20 and above. This may be granted on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.
It is evident from the foregoing provisions that the rates of hazard pay must be 
at least
 25% of the basic monthly salary of PWHs receiving salary grade 19 and below, and 5% receiving salary grade 20 and above. As such, RA No. 7305 and its implementing rules noticeably prescribe the minimum rates of hazard pay due all PHWs in the government, as is clear in the self-explanatory phrase "at least" used in both the law and the rules.
[36]
 Thus, the following rates embodied in Section 7.2 of DBM-DOH Joint Circular must be struck down as invalid for being contrary to the mandate of RA No. 7305 and its Revised IRR:
7.2.1 For PHWs whose positions are at SG-19 and below, Hazard Pay shall be based on the degree of exposure to high risk or low risk hazards, as specified in sub-items 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 above, and the number of workdays of actual exposure over 22 workdays in a month, at rates not to exceed 25% of monthly basic salary. In case of exposure to both high risk and low risk hazards, the Hazard Pay for the month shall be based on only one risk level, whichever is more advantageous to the PHW.
7.2.2 PHWs whose positions are at SG-20 and above may be entitled to Hazard Pay at 5% of their monthly basic salaries for all days of exposure to high risk and/or low risk hazards. However, those exposed to high risk hazards for 12 or more days in a month may be entitled to a fixed amount of P4,989.75 per month.
Rates of Hazard Pay
Actual Exposure/ Level of Risk
High Risk
Low Risk
12 or more days
25% of monthly basic salary
14% of monthly basic salary
6 to 11 days
14% of monthly basic salary
8% of monthly basic salary
Less than 6 days
8% of monthly basic salary
5% of monthly basic salary
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the instant petition is 
PARTLY GRANTED
. The DBM-DOH Joint Circular, insofar as it lowers the hazard pay at rates below the minimum prescribed by Section 21 of RA No. 7305 and Section 7.1.5 (a) of its Revised IRR, is declared 
INVALID
. The DBM-CSC Joint Circular, insofar as it provides that an official or employee authorized to be granted Longevity Pay under an existing law is not eligible for the grant of Step Increment Due to Length of Service, is declared 
UNENFORCEABLE
. The validity, however, of the DBM-DOH Joint Circular as to the qualification of actual exposure to danger for the PHWs entitlement to hazard pay, the rates of P50 and P25 subsistence allowance, and the entitlement to longevity pay on the basis of the PHWs status in the plantilla of regular positions, is

SEPARATE 
OPINION
 BRION, 
J
.:


I write this Separate Opinion to present an 
alternative approach in resolving the present case. This alternative 
approach discusses (and raises questions about) the procedure that this 
Court observes in taking 
jurisdiction over petitions 
questioning quasi-legislative acts
. In my view, the 
attendant facts of the present case and the 
ponencia
âs approach aptly 
illustrate the need to revisit our present approach. 

In recent years, we have been relaxing the 

certiorari
 requirements of Rule 65
 of the Rules of Court
[1]
 to give due course to 

certiorari
 petitions assailing 
quasi-legislative acts. Awareness of the impact of this trend is 
crucial, since we can only act on the basis of the âjudicial powerâ 
granted to us by the Constitution. In blunter terms, our present 
approach is necessarily rooted in, and must be consistent with, the 
constitutional definition of judicial power. 

Judicial power, as defined under Section 1, Article 
VIII of the 1987 Constitution, includes â
the duty of the courts
 of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are 
legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not 
there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess 
of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the 
Government
.â 
Thus, in determining whether 
the Court should take jurisdiction over a case, it must, necessarily, 
first determine whether there is an 
actual 
controversy
 in which the Court can grant the 
appropriate relief through its judgment. This may involve 

private rights
 that are legally 
demandable and enforceable, or 
public 
rights
, which involve the nullification of a 
governmental act that had been exercised without, or in excess of its, 
jurisdiction.  
At present, we have been 
allowing petitions for 
certiorari
 
and prohibition to assail a quasi-legislative act whenever we find a 
paramount importance in deciding the petitions. 
This
 approach, in my view, has no essential relation to the question of 
whether an actual controversy exists; hence, its use as a standard in 
determining whether to take jurisdiction over a petition is 

inherently contrary to the requirements for the 
exercise of judicial power
.  

Factual 
antecedents
 
The present petition
 for 
certiorari
 and 

prohibition
 assails the validity of Joint Circular 
No. 1 dated November 29, 2012 of the Department of Budget and Management
 (
DBM
) and Department of Health 
(
DOH
), as well as Joint Circular dated September 3, 
2012 of the DBM and Civil Service Commission (
CSC
). 

The petitioners are officers and members of the 
Philippine Public Health Association, Inc. (
PPHAI
). 
On January 23, 2013, they sent a letter addressed to the respondents 
Secretary of Budget and Management and Secretary of Health, expressing 
their opposition to the Joint Circulars as they diminish the benefits 
granted to them by the 
Magna Carta
 of Public Health 
Workers (Republic Act No. 7305, hereinafter RA 7305). 

Thereafter, the petitioners filed a Petition for 

Certiorari
 and Prohibition before 
this Court, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the respondents 

for issuing the joint circulars
. According to the 
petitioners, the joint circulars had been issued with grave abuse of 
discretion for the following reasons:
(1) 

the joint circulars 
impose 
additional requirements to the grant of hazard pay
, 

i.e.
, it requires the PHWsâ duties to expose them to 
danger, when RA 7305 does not require such 
condition;
(2)
 
the joint circulars 
unduly fix subsistence 
allowance
 at Php50 per day for full-time service and Php25 for
 part-time service, and these 
not in accordance with 
the prevailing circumstances required by RA 
7305
;
(3)
 the joint circulars prematurely took effect on 
January 1, 2012;
(4) 

longevity 
pay had been 
wrongfully granted only to regular 
plantilla positions
, and unduly 

withheld the Step Increment due to Length of 
Service
 from those who have already been granted 
longevity pay. [Emphasis 
supplied.]
The
 
ponencia
 aptly characterized the respondentsâ acts 
as 
quasi-legislative in nature
; hence, they are acts 
not assailable through the writs of 

certiorari
 and prohibition under 
the 
strict terms
 of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. 

From this characterization, the 

ponencia
 proceeded to discuss the substantive issues 
raised in the petition to â
finally resolve the doubt over the 
Joint Circularsâ validity
.â 

According to the 

ponencia
, âthe pressing issue of whether or not the 
joint circulars regulating the salaries and benefits relied upon by 
public health workers were tainted with grave abuse of discretion 
rightly deserves its prompt resolution.â 
The 

ponencia
 partially granted the petition, and held 
that the following aspects of the Joint Circulars are tainted with grave
 abuse of discretion: (1) the ineligibility of grantees of longevity pay
 from receiving the step increment due to length of service is 
unenforceable as it had not been published in the ONAR; and (2) the 
imposition of hazard pay below the minimum prescribed under RA 7305 is 
invalid. 
The traditional approach 
in assailing 
quasi-legislative acts


I agree with the 
ponencia
âs 
conclusion that the petitioners availed of an 
improper 
remedy
 to directly assail the Joint Circulars before the 
Court.  
A writ of 

certiorari
 lies against judicial 
or quasi-judicial acts, while a writ of prohibition is the proper remedy
 to address judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial acts. Hence, under 
these terms alone, the present petition is easily dismissible for having
 been an improper remedy. 
Traditionally, the proper 
remedy to assail the validity of these joint circulars would have been 
through an ordinary action for nullification filed with the proper 
Regional Trial Court. Any allegation that the respondents are performing
 or threatening to perform functions without or in excess of their 
jurisdiction may appropriately be prevented or prohibited through a writ
 of injunction or a temporary restraining order.
[2]
 
Had the 
petitioners availed of the proper remedy, then immediate recourse to 
this Courtâs original jurisdiction to issue a writ of 

certiorari
 or prohibition would 
have been avoided. While this Court has original jurisdiction to issue 
these extraordinary writs, this jurisdiction is shared with the Regional
 Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. 
As a matter 
of policy, direct recourse to the Court is frowned upon and a violation 
of the policy renders a petition dismissible under the 
Doctrine
 of Hierarchy of Courts
. 
Despite the 
observed impropriety of remedies used, the 
ponencia
 
proceeded to render its decision on the case, and partially granted it 
under the following dispositive 
portion:
WHEREFORE
, 
premises considered, the instant petition is 
PARTLY 
GRANTED
. The DBM-DOH Joint Circular, insofar as it lowers the 
hazard pay at rates below the minimum prescribed by Section 21 of RA No.
 7305 and Section 7.1.5 (a) of its Revised IRR, is declared 

INVALID
. The DBM-CSC Joint Circular, insofar as it 
provides that an official or employee authorized to be granted Longevity
 Pay under an existing law is not eligible for the grant of Step 
Increment Due to Length of Service, is declared 

UNENFORCEABLE
. The validity, however, of the DBM-DOH 
Joint Circular as to the qualification of actual exposure to danger for 
PHWâs entitlement to hazard pay, the rates Php50 and Php25 subsistence 
allowance, and the entitlement to longevity pay on the basis of the 
PHWâs status in the plantilla of regular positions, is 

UPHELD
.
The 

ponencia
âs approach in resolving the petition is not 
without precedent. Indeed, in the past, we have granted petitions for 

certiorari
 and prohibition that 
assail quasi-legislative acts despite the use of inappropriate remedies 
in questioning the quasi-legislative acts. 
In 
granting the petitions and invalidating the questioned legislative act, 
we gave consideration to the â
transcendental nature 
and paramount importanceâ of deciding the issues they 
raised
. In some cases, we also invoked âcompelling 
state interestâ as reason to justify the early resolution of these 
issues,
[3]
 and 
observed as well the need for the Court to make 
a 
final and definitive pronouncement on pivotal issues for everyoneâs 
enlightenment and guidance
.
[4]


The public importance of resolving 
 issues in a petition should not 
determine whether the Court takes 
jurisdiction over a case
In my 
view, the public importance of resolving the issues presented in a 
petition should not determine the Courtâs jurisdiction over a case, as 
public importance does not affect the subject matter of these petitions.
 That a petition relates to a matter of public importance does not make 
the abuse in the exercise of discretion any more or less grave. 

For instance, we gave due course to the petitions 
for 
certiorari
 in 
Review 
Center Association of the Philippines v. Executive 
Secretary
,
[5]
 and in 
Pharmaceutical and Healthcare 
Association of the Philippines v. Secretary of Health
,
[6]
 both of which assail 
quasi-legislative acts.  
The administrative
 rules in these petitions carry different public policy reasons behind 
them, and I cannot see how these policy goals could have affected the 
fact that in both cases, the respondent administrative agency acted 
outside of its jurisdiction in issuing administrative rules that 
contradict with, or are not contemplated by, the laws they seek to 
implement. 
In more concrete terms, the right to have
 access to quality education, which is the state interest in issuing the
 assailed Executive Order No. 566 in 
Review Center Association 
of the Philippines v. Executive Secretary
,
[7]
 does not have any 
direct bearing on the fact that its provisions extended beyond the 
provisions of the laws it seeks to implement. 
The 
same argument applies to Sections 4(f), 11 and 46 of Administrative 
Order No. 2006-0012, which had been invalidated through a 

certiorari
 petition in 

Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines v.
 Secretary of Health
.
[8]
 That the nation has an interest in promoting the
 breastfeeding of Filipino infants does not affect the authority of the 
Secretary of Health to issue administrative rules that are beyond what 
the Milk Code requires. 
A law, by its very nature 
and definition, governs human conduct that is important to 
society.
[9]
 That 
the State, through Congress, found that a particular conduct should be 
regulated already speaks of the importance of, and need for, this 
regulation. 
Necessarily, any deviation from this 
regulation carries some degree of importance to the public, because 
society, by agreeing to a regulation, has an interest that it be applied
 to all persons covered by the law, without exception. 

Our Constitution has established how the need for 
regulation is identified, as well as the process for its formulation and
 implementation. The identification function has been given to Congress 
through the process of law-making. Implementation, on the other hand, 
has been given to the Executive. Our task in the Judiciary comes only in
 cases of conflict, either in the implementation of these laws or in the
 exercise of the powers of the two other branches of government.
[10]


This is how our republican, democratic system of 
government institutionalizes the doctrine of separation of powers, with 
each branch of government reigning supreme over its particular 
designation under the Constitution.
[11]
 
When we, as the Highest 
Court of the land, decree that an issue involving the implementation of a
 law is of paramount interest, does this declaration not teeter towards 
the role assigned for Congress, which possesses the plenary power to 
determine what needs are to be regulated and how the regulation should 
operate? 
This problem, I believe, becomes even 
starker when we look at this phenomenon at the macro-level: when we, 

by exception
, decide to take 
jurisdiction in some cases, and apply the 
general 
rule
 in others. Thereby, we, in effect, determine 
that public issues are more important or paramount than others. 

Taking an active part in determining how public 
issues are prioritized is not part of the judicial power vested in the 
Court. We may do this tangentially, as 
the outcome of 
our cases could demonstrate public importance
, but 
we cannot and should not make this outcome the basis of when we should 
exercise judicial power. 
A survey of cases involving
 a petition for 
certiorari
 against
 a quasi-legislative act shows the 
uneven, and rather 
arbitrary, record
 of how we determine the paramount 
importance standard. 
We have, in the past, 

relaxed the requirements
 for 

certiorari
 in petitions against 
the following quasi-legislative acts: (1) Commission on Audit Circular 
No. 89-299 lifting the pre-audit of government transactions of national 
government agencies;
[12]
 (2) Comelec Resolution No. 8678 considering any
 candidate holding public appointive office to have ipso facto resigned 
upon filing his or her Certificate of Candidacy;
[13]
 (3) Comelec Resolution No. 9615 
limiting the broadcast and radio advertisements of candidates and 
political parties for national election positions to an aggregate total 
of one hundred twenty (120) minutes and one hundred eighty (180) 
minutes, respectively;
[14]
 (4) Executive Order No. 566 (EO 566) and 
Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 30, series of
 2007 (RIRR) directing the Commission on Higher Education to regulate 
the establishment and operation of review centers;
[15]
 and (5) Administrative Order (A.O.)
 No. 2006-0012 implementing the Milk Code.
[16]
 
On the other hand, 

we applied the strict requirements

 for a 
certiorari
 petition against
 the following: (1) Section 2.6 of the Distribution Services and Open 
Access Rules (DSOAR), which obligates certain customers to advance the 
amount needed to cover the expenses of extending lines and installing 
additional facilities
[17]
 (2) Comelec Resolution No. 7798 prohibiting 
barangay officials and tanods from staying in polling places during 
elections
[18]
 (3) 
Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Administrative Order (AO) No. 01-02,
 as amended by DAR AO No. 05-07 and DAR Memorandum No. 88 involving the 
reclassification of agricultural lands
[19]
 (4) Executive Order No. 7 Directing the 
Rationalization of the Compensation and Position Classification System 
in Government Owned and Controlled Corporations and Government Financial
 Institutions;
[20]

 and (5) the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of Republic Act 
No. 9207, otherwise known as the âNational Government Center (NGC) 
Housing and Land Utilization Act of 2003.â
[21]
 
I believe that all 
these quasi-legislative acts involve matters that are important to the 
public. The Court is not in the position to weigh which of these 
regulations carried more importance than the others by exercising 
jurisdiction over petitions involving some of them and dismissing other 
petitions outright. 
Who are we, for instance, to say
 that regulating review centers is more important than the conversion of
 agricultural lands? Or that the 
ipso facto
 
resignation of public appointive officials running for office is more 
important than the prohibition against barangay officials to stay in 
polling places during the elections? 
To my mind, 
these issues all affect our nation, and the Court cannot and should not 
impose any standard, unless the measure is provided in the Constitution 
or in our laws, to determine why one petition would be more important 
than another, such that the former deserves the relaxation of 

certiorari
 
requirements.
 
Furthermore, the relaxation 
of 
certiorari
 requirements through
 the paramount importance exception affects our approach in reviewing 

cases brought to us on appeal
. Our
 appellate jurisdiction reviews the decisions of the lower court for 
errors of law,
[22]

 or errors of law and fact.
[23]
  
In several 
cases,
[24]
 
however, we reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals denying a 
petition for 
certiorari
 against a 
quasi-legislative act based on the terms of the Rules of Court. In these
 reversals, we significantly noted the paramount importance of resolving
 the case on appeal and, on this basis, relaxed the requirements of the 
petition for 
certiorari
 filed in 
the lower court. 
This kind of approach, to my mind, 
leads to an absurd situation where we effectively hold that the 

CA committed an error of law when it applied the rules as 
provided in the Rules of Court
.
To be sure,
 when we so act, we send mixed and confusing signals to the lower 
courts, which cannot be expected to know when a 

certiorari
 petition may or should 
be allowed despite being the improper remedy. 

Additionally, this kind of approach reflects badly 
on the Court as an institution, as it applies the highly arbitrary 
standard of âparamount importanceâ in place of what is written in the 
Rules. A suspicious mind may even attribute malicious motives when the 
Court invokes a highly subjective standard such as âparamount 
importance.â 
The public, no less, is left confused 
by the Courtâs uneven approach. Thus, it may not hesitate to file a 
petition that violates or skirts the margins of the Rules or its 
jurisprudence, in the hope that the Court would consider its presented 
issue to be of paramount importance and on this basis take cognizance of
 the petition.  
Assailing
 quasi-legislative acts 
through the Courtâs expanded 
jurisdiction
 
I believe that the 
better approach in handling the 

certiorari
 cases assailing 
quasi-legislative acts should be to treat them as petitions invoking 

the Courtâs expanded jurisdiction
.
 Thus, the standard in determining whether to exercise judicial power in
 these cases should be the petitionersâ 
prima facie
 that showing that 
the respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the 
quasi-legislative act. 
Should the petitioners 
sufficiently prove, 
prima facie
, a case for grave 
abuse of discretion, then the petition should be given due course. If 
not, then it should be dismissed outright. 
Through 
this approach, which the Court can institutionalize through appropriate 
rules, the traditional Rule 65 approach can be maintained, while 
providing for rules that sets the parameters to invoke the courtsâ 
expanded jurisdiction to cover situations of grave abuse of discretion 
in any agency of the government.
  

Notably, most of the 

certiorari
 cases that applied the 
paramount importance exception eventually granted, or partially granted,
 the petition.
[25]

 Thus, the Court, in giving due course to the petition must have 
observed that it had merit, and this initial determination was 
sufficient to bypass the requirements for a 

certiorari
 petition. 

In other words, it was not the paramount importance 
of the issues presented that led the Court to decide on the case; it was
 - as in the present case - the initially shown possibility that the 
injuries claimed may be established and the remedies prayed for may be 
granted.
To cite a past example, the difference 
between the petitions assailing the quasi-legislative act placing review
 centers under the CHEDâs regulation, and the act providing for the 
conversion of agricultural lands was not the formerâs greater importance
 so that the rules was relaxed to give it due course. Their difference 
could be found in the potency of the issues they presented: in the 
former, there had been a 
prima facie
 showing of grave
 abuse of discretion, as shown by the eventual grant of the petition. In
 the latter, the 
prime facie
 grave abuse of 
discretion threshold was not met; thus, it was not given due course. 

I have additionally observed that in several 
cases
[26]
 
dismissing the petition for 

certiorari
 against 
quasi-legislative acts, we even provided arguments against the 
substantive issues in these petitions. In these cases, we held the 
petition to be procedurally infirm (such that it warranted immediate 
dismissal), but at the same time noted that these petitions offer no 
substantive arguments against the assailed acts, such that the petition 
would not be granted even if we were to proceed to give it due course. 

In light of these uneven 
approaches, I believe it to be more practical, and certainly less 
arbitrary, if we would only take jurisdiction over a 

certiorari
 petition involving a 
quasi-legislative act through an initial, cursory determination of 
whether there had been a prima facie showing of grave abuse of 
discretion.
[27]
 
This approach of course 
should not affect the ordinary remedies that may be availed of to assail
 quasi-legislative acts before the lower courts. 

Certiorari
, after all, remains to 
be an extraordinary writ, to be issued only when there is no other 
plain, speedy recourse. 

Certiorari
, 
additionally, lies only against acts of grave abuse of discretion â 

i.e.
, an act that is not only legally erroneous, but 
is often described as âarbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or blatantly in
 disregard of the law,â so that government official or agency acting on 
the matter is divested of jurisdiction.
[28]
 
The 
respondents committed grave 
abuse of discretion in insisting that 
public
 health workers with a salary 
grade of 19 or lower should be given 
less 
than 25 percent of their salary as 
hazard pay.


I agree with the 
ponencia
 that 
the respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in formulating the 
hazard pay of public health workers with a salary grade of 19 or lower. 

The joint circulars that the respondents formulated 
determine hazard pay depending on the actual exposure and level of risk 
that public health workers experience while at work. While the 
respondents possess the discretion to determine how hazard pay is 
formulated and to categorize it according to risk and exposure, the 
formulation should not be contrary to what the 
Magna 
Carta
 for Public Health Workers provides them. 

The formulation of hazard pay under the joint 
circulars provides a hazard pay amounting to 25% of the PHWâs salary 
only when they are exposed to high risk hazard for 12 or more days. PHWs
 exposed during a lesser period to high or low risks receive lower 
hazard pay; the same goes for PHWs exposed to low risk for 122 or more 
days:
Actual Exposure/Level of 
Risk
High Risk
Low 
Risk
12 or more 
days
25% of 
monthly salary
14% of monthly 
salary
6 to 11 days
14% of monthly 
salary
8% of 
monthly 
salary
Less than 6 
days
8% of 
monthly salary
5% of monthly 
salary
This
 formulation blatantly disregards the text of the 
Magna 
Carta
, as well as jurisprudence interpreting this text. 

RA 7305 provides that the hazard pay of public 
health workers with a salary grade of 19 or lower should be AT LEAST be 
25% of their salary, 

viz
:
Section 21. Hazard 
Allowance. - Public health workers in hospitals, sanitaria, rural health
 units, main health centers, health infirmaries, barangay health 
stations, clinics and other health-related establishments located in 
difficult areas, strife-torn or embattled areas, distressed or isolated 
stations, prisons camps, mental hospitals, radiation-exposed clinics, 
laboratories or disease-infested areas or in areas declared under state 
of calamity or emergency for the duration thereof which expose them to 
great danger, contagion, radiation, volcanic activity/eruption, 
occupational risks or perils to life as determined by the Secretary of 
Health or the Head of the unit with the approval of the Secretary of 
Health, 
shall be compensated hazard allowances 
equivalent to 
at least twenty-five percent (25%)
 of 
the monthly basic salary of health workers receiving salary grade 19 and
 below
, and five percent (5%) for health workers 
with salary grade 20 and above.
This 
provision had already been the subject of the Courtâs decision in In Re 
Entitlement 
To Hazard Pay of SC Medical and Dental Clinic 
Personnel
,
[29]
 where the Court observed 
that:
In a language too plain to be mistaken,
 R.A. No. 7305 and its implementing rules mandate that the allocation 
and distribution of hazard allowances to public health workers within 
each of the two salary grade brackets at the respective rates of 25% and
 5% be based on the salary grade to which the covered employees 
belong.
While the issue in 
In Re 
Entitlement To Hazard Pay of SC Medical and Dental Clinic 
Personnel
 involved hazard allowance for PHWs with a salary of 
SG 20 and above, the import of the decision is clear: the rates found in
 RA 7305 are the minimum rates prescribed for hazard pay, and the 
government cannot prescribe any rate lower than these. 

That Joint Resolution No. 4 subsequently provided 
for a uniform benefits package for government employees does not affect 
existing 
Magna Carta
 benefits, including RA 7305. The
 Joint Resolution provides:
Nothing in this 
Joint Resolution shall be interpreted to reduce, diminish or in any way,
 alter the benefits provided for in existing laws on Magna Carta 
benefits for specific officials and employees in government, regardless 
of whether said benefits have already been received or have yet to be 
implemented.
A simple reading of these laws,
 as well as that of 
In Re Entitlement To Hazard Pay of SC 
Medical and Dental Clinic Personnel
 clearly shows that PHWs 
are entitled to the minimum rates for hazard pay provided in RA 7305. 

By issuing Joint Circulars that completely disregard
 this rule, the respondents committed a patent and gross abuse of its 
discretion to formulate the amount payable for hazard pay; this 
disregard amounted to an evasion of its positive duty to implement RA 
7305, particularly the minimum rates it prescribes for hazard pay. 

Thus, the respondents committed grave abuse of 
discretion in enacting the Joint Circulars. Its provisions lowering the 
PHWâs hazard pay below the minimum required in RA 7305 is thus void. 
Administrative rules cannot contradict the laws it implements, and in 
the present case, the contradiction against RA 7305 is an invalid act on
 the part of the respondents. 
Given the existing 
grave abuse, it becomes easier and more reasonable to recognize this 
case as an exception to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. This 
doctrine, of course, is a procedural matter that must reasonably yield 
when a greater substantive reason exists.  

For these alternative reasons, I concur in the 
result and vote for the grant of the petition.

 The Blackâs Law Dictionary provides the 
following definitions of law:
1. That which is laid 
down, ordained, or established. A rule or method according to which 
phenomena or actions coexist or follow each other. 2. A system of 
principles and rules of human conduct, being the aggregate of those 
commandments and principles which are either prescribed or recognized by
 the governing power in an organized jural society as its will in 
relation to the conduct of the members of such society, and which it 
undertakes to maintain and sanction and to use as the criteria of the 
actions of such members. "Law" is a solemn expression of legislative 
will. It orders and permits and forbids. It announces rewards and 
punishments. Its provisions generally relate not to solitary or singular
 cases, but to what passes in the ordinary course of affairs. Civ. Code 
La. arts. 1. 2. "Law," without an article, properly implies a science or
 system of principles or rules of human conduct, answering to the Latin 
"jus;" as when it is spoken of as a subject of study or practice. In 
this sense, it includes the decisions of courts of justice, as well as 
acts of the legislature. The judgment of a competent, court, until 
reversed or otherwise superseded, is law, as much as any statute. 
Indeed, it may happen that a statute may be passed in violation of law, 
that is, of the fundamental law or constitution of a state; that it is 
the prerogative of courts in such cases to declare it void, or, in other
 words, to declare it not to be law. Rurrill. 3. A rule of civil conduct

CONCURRING and DISSENTING 
OPINION
LEONEN, 

J
.:
 
I concur in the result with regard to 
the declaration that several provisions in the joint circulars are 
invalid and unenforceable. However, with much regret, I cannot join the 
ponencia. 
The remedy sought by petitioners should be
 granted. The joint circulars promulgated by the Department of Budget 
and Management were issued with grave abuse of discretion because it 
contravened the provisions of Republic Act No. 7305,
[1]
 also known as the 
Magna Carta of Public Health Workers. 

I
Certiorari
 and Prohibition are available remedies when there is a proper 
allegation of breach of a constitutional provision and an actual case or
 controversy that can narrow the formulation of the relevant doctrines. 

Article VIII, Section 1, paragraph 2 of the 1987 
Constitution states that:
Judicial power 
includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual 
controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and 
enforceable, 
and to determine whether or not there has been a 
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on
 the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government
. 
(Emphasis supplied)
In 
TaÃ±ada v. 
Angara
,
[2]
 this courtâs duty was characterized as 
follows:
As explained by former Chief Justice
 Roberto Concepcion, âthe judiciary is the final arbiter on the question
 of whether or not a branch of government or any of its officials has 
acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or so 
capriciously as to constitute an abuse of discretion amounting to excess
 of jurisdiction. This is not only a judicial power but a duty to pass 
judgment on matters of this nature.â
As this Court 
has repeatedly and firmly emphasized in many cases, it will not shirk, 
digress from or abandon its sacred duty and authority to uphold the 
Constitution in matters that involve grave abuse of discretion brought 
before it in appropriate cases, committed by any officer, agency, 
instrumentality or department of the government. 
As 
the petition alleges grave abuse of discretion and as there is no other 
plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, we have 
no hesitation at all in holding that this petition should be given due 
course and the vital questions raised therein ruled upon under Rule 65 
of the Rules of Court. Indeed, 

certiorari
, prohibition and 

mandamus
 are appropriate remedies to raise 
constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit/nullify, when 
proper, acts of legislative and executive officials. On this, we have no
 equivocation.
[3]
 
(Citations omitted)
In addition, this court 
recently clarified in 
Araullo v. Aquino III
:
[4]
With respect to the 
Court, however, the remedies of 
certiorari
 and 
prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of 

certiorari
 or prohibition may be issued to correct 
errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, 
board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial 
functions but also to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any 
branch or instrumentality of the Government, even if the latter does not
 exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. This 
application is expressly authorized by the text of the second paragraph 
of Section 1, [Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution].
[5]
The Department of 
Budget and Management promulgated joint circulars in clear and patent 
breach of Republic Act No. 7305. The joint circulars appear to be based 
on Joint Resolution No. 4, Series of 2009, which amended several 
laws.
[6]
 The 
implementation of the joint circulars is imminent and affects a critical
 sector of government employees. The partiesâ positions have thus become
 sufficiently adversarial and properly framed within clear factual 
ambients. 

II
Republic
 Act No. 7305 specifically provides that the Management-Health Workersâ 
Consultative Council must be consulted for the computation and grant of 
allowances to public health workers. Consultation is clearly statutory. 
The pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 7305 
provide:
SEC. 22. 
Subsistence 
Allowance
. â Public health workers who are required to render 
service within the premises of hospitals, sanitaria, health infirmaries,
 main health centers, rural health units and barangay health stations, 
or clinics, and other health-related establishments in order to make 
their services available at any and all times, shall be entitled to full
 subsistence allowance of three (3) meals which may be computed 

in accordance with prevailing circumstances as determined by 
the Secretary of Health in consultation with the Management-Health 
Workersâ Consultative Councils, as established under Section 33 of this 
Act: Provided
, That representation and travel allowance shall 
be given to rural health physicians as enjoyed by municipal 
agriculturists, municipal planning and development officers and budget 
officers. 
. . .                    . . .                    . . .
SEC. 33. 

Consultation with Health Workersâ Organizations. â In the 
formulation of national policies governing the social security of public
 health workers, professional and health workersâ organizations or union
 as well as other appropriate government agencies concerned shall be 
consulted by the Secretary of Health
. For this purpose, 
Management-Health Workersâ Consultative Councils for national, regional 
and other appropriate levels shall be established and operationalized. 
(Emphasis supplied)
However, it appears that
 the joint circulars were issued without the Secretary of the Department
 of Health consulting with the Management-Health Workersâ Consultative 
Council. It also appears that the assailed joint circulars
[7]
 were issued pursuant 
to Joint Circular No. 4, Series of 2009.
[8]
 Joint Resolution No. 4 is entitled âJoint 
Resolution Authorizing the President of the Philippines to Modify the 
Compensation and Position Classification System of Civilian Personnel 
and the Base Pay Schedule of Military and Uniformed Personnel in the 
Government, and for Other Purposes.â
[9]
 
Item 6
[10]
 of Joint Resolution No. 4 removed 
the requirement that the Secretary of the Department of Health should 
discuss with consultative councils the rates of allowances and the 
release of Magna Carta benefits. This was also reflected in Provision 
1.1 of Department of Budget and Management-Department of Health Joint 
Circular No. 1, Series of 2012,
[11]
 which 
states:

On the other hand, Item (6), âMagna Carta Benefits,â 
of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution (JR) No. 4, 
s. 2009, approved on June 17, 2009, âJoint Resolution Authorizing the 
President of the Philippines to Modify the Compensation and Position 
Classification System of Civilian Personnel and the Base Pay Schedule of
 Military and Uniformed Personnel in the Government, and for Other 
Purposes,â provides among others, that the Department of Budget and 
Management (DBM), in coordination with the agencies concerned, shall 
determine the qualifications, conditions, and rates in the grant of said
 benefits, and to determine those that may be categorized under the 
Total Compensation Framework. 
It further states that the 
consultative councils, departments, and officials previously authorized 
to issue the implementing rules and regulations of Magna Carta benefits 
shall no longer exercise said functions relative to the grant of said 
benefits
.
1.3
 
 Pursuant to the compensation principles espoused in 
the said JR No. 4, the grant of compensation-related Magna Carta 
benefits to PHWs needs to be rationalized to ensure equity and 
uniformity in remuneration. (Emphasis 
supplied)
The
 creation of consultative councils for public health workers was a 
significant right granted in Republic Act No. 7305. Section 22 of 
Republic Act No. 7305 required the Secretary of the Department of Health
 to consult with the Management-Health Workersâ Consultative Council to 
provide for the computation of subsistence allowances. The concept of 
this consultative council was clearly articulated in Section 33. The 
participation of health workers in the drafting of the guidelines 
empowered them. It also achieved several purposes, which included 
ensuring immediate feedback from health workers, and thus increasing the
 possibility of improving the overall efficiency of all health agencies.
 
Announced as part of the package of rights in 
Republic Act No. 7305, the Management-Health Workersâ Consultative 
Council was taken away piecemeal by a broadly entitled joint resolution.
 The validity of Joint Resolution No. 4 was suspect because it revised 
several laws and was passed by Congress in a manner not provided by the 
Constitution.
[12]


Department of Budget and Management-Civil Service 
Commission Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012,
[13]
 also cites Joint Resolution No. 4, 
Series of 2009, as follows:
1.0 
Background
Item (4)(d) of the Senate and 
House of Representatives Joint Resolution No. 4, s. 2009, âJoint 
Resolution Authorizing the President of the Philippines to Modify the 
Compensation and Position Classification System of Civilian Personnel 
and the Base Pay Schedule of Military and Uniformed Personnel in the 
Government, and for Other Purposes,â approved by the President of the 
Philippines on June 17, 2009, provides as follows: 

(d) Step 
Increments â An employee may progress from Step 1 to Step 8 of the 
salary grade allocation of his/her position in recognition of 
meritorious performance based on a Performance Management System 
approved by the CSC and/or through length of service, in accordance with
 the rules and regulations to be promulgated jointly by the DBM and the 
CSC.
Employees authorized to receive Longevity Pay 
under existing laws shall no longer be entitled to Step Increments Due 
to Length of Service. The grant of Step Increment based on Merit and 
Performance shall be in lieu of the Productivity Incentive 
Benefit.
Joint resolutions are not 
sufficient to notify the public that a statute is being passed or 
amended. As in this case, the amendment to a significant empowering 
provision in Republic Act No. 7305 was done through a joint resolution. 
The general public will be misled when it attempts to understand the 
state of the law since it will also have to comb through joint 
resolutions in order to ensure that published Republic Acts have not 
been amended. 

III
Another
 instance showing grave abuse of discretion is that Department of Budget
 and Management-Department of Health Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 
2012 provides for rates of hazard pay that are lower than the minimum 
provided under Republic Act No. 7305.
[14]
 This was recognized in the ponencia when it 
held that the rates of hazard pay must be invalidated for contravening 
Republic Act No. 7305.
[15]


IV
Petitioners
 further argue that the assailed joint circulars are null and void 
because these were not published in accordance with the 30-day period as
 required by Republic Act No. 7305. The ponencia addresses this issue as
 follows:
Indeed, publication, as a basic 
postulate of procedural due process, is required by law in order for 
administrative rules and regulations to be effective. There are, 
however, several exceptions, one of which are interpretative regulations
 which âneed nothing further than their bare issuance for they give no 
real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed.â 
These regulations need not be published for they add nothing to the law 
and do not affect substantial rights of any person. 

. . .                    . . .                    . . . 
In this case, the 
DBM-DOH Joint Circular in question gives no real consequence more than 
what the law itself had already prescribed. . . . There is really no new 
obligation or duty imposed by the subject circular for it merely 
reiterated those embodied in RA No. 7305 and its Revised IRR. The Joint 
Circular did not modify, amend nor supplant the Revised IRR, the 
validity of which is undisputed. Consequently, whether it was duly 
published and filed with the UP Law Center â ONAR is necessarily 
immaterial to its validity because in view of the pronouncements above, 
interpretative regulations, such as the DBM-DOH circular herein, need 
not be published nor filed with the UP Law Venter â ONAR in order to be 
effective. Neither is prior hearing or consultation mandatory.
[16]
 (Citations 
omitted)
The ponencia further discusses that
 in any case, the Department of Budget and Management-Department of 
Health Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, was published in the 
Philippine Star on December 29, 2012.
[17]
 
Section 35 of Republic Act 
No. 7305 states:
SEC. 35. 
Rules and 
Regulations
. â The Secretary of Health after consultation with
 appropriate agencies of the Government as well as professional and 
health workersâ organizations or unions, shall formulate and prepare the
 necessary rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this 
Act. Rules and regulations issued pursuant to this Section shall take 
effect thirty (30) days after publication in a newspaper of general 
circulation.
Republic Act No. 7305 is 
explicit that rules and regulations âtake effect thirty (30) days after 
publication.â While Department of Budget and Management-Department of 
Health Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, provided for its own date 
of effectivity, it cannot amend what is provided in the law it 
implements. In this case, the circular took effect after the lapse of 
only three (3) days. 
Moreover, Republic Act No. 7305
 is a law while Department of Budget and Management-Department of Health
 Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, is an administrative circular. As
 we ruled in 
Trade and Investment Development Corporation of 
the Philippines v. Civil Service Commission
,
[18]
 an administrative 
circular cannot amend the provisions of a 
law.
While rules issued by administrative 
bodies are entitled to great respect, â[t]he conclusive effect of 
administrative construction is not absolute. [T]he function of 
promulgating rules and regulations may be legitimately exercised only 
for the purpose of carrying the provisions of the law into effect. x x x
 [
A
]
dministrative regulations cannot extend 
the law [nor] amend a legislative enactment; x x x administrative 
regulations must be in harmony with the provisions of the 
law
[,]â and in a conflict between the basic law and an 
implementing rule or regulation, the former must prevail.
[19]

V
I agree
 with the ponencia that the Department of Budget and Management-Civil 
Service Commission Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, is 
unenforceable because it has not been deposited with the Office of the 
National Administrative Register at the University of the Philippines 
Law Center.
[20]
 
However, it is my opinion that Department of Budget and 
Management-Department of Health Joint Circular No. 1, Series of 2012, 
should also be deposited with the Office of the National Administrative 
Register before it can be validly enforced. 
Book 
VII, Chapter 2, Section 3 of the Administrative Code
[21]
 provides 
that:
SECTION 3.
 
Filing.â(1) Every agency shall file with the University of the 
Philippines Law Center three (3) certified copies of every rule adopted 
by it. Rules in force on the date of effectivity of this Code which are 
not filed within three (3) months from that date shall not thereafter be
 the basis of any sanction against any party or persons. 

(2) The records officer of the agency, or his 
equivalent functionary, shall carry out the requirements of this section
 under pain of disciplinary action.
(3) A permanent 
register of all rules shall be kept by the issuing agency and shall be 
open to public inspection.
Book VII, Chapter
 1, Section 2 of the Administrative Code defines âruleâ 
as:
SECTION 2.
 
Definitions.âAs used in this Book:
(2) âRuleâ
 means any agency statement of general applicability that implements or 
interprets a law, fixes and describes the procedures in, or practice 
requirements of, an agency, including its regulations. The term includes
 memoranda or statements concerning the internal administration or 
management of an agency not affecting the rights of, or procedure 
available to, the 
public.
The assailed 
joint circulars can be considered as ârulesâ that must be deposited with
 the Office of the National Administrative Register. These circulars 
provide guidelines for the implementation of the benefits provided under
 Republic Act No. 7305. 
The publication of the 
assailed joint circulars in a newspaper of general circulation does not 
remove the requirement of the Administrative Code that the circulars 
must be deposited with the Office of the National Administrative 
Register. The pertinent portion of the Guidelines for Receiving and 
Publication of Rules and Regulations Filed with the UP Law Center
[22]
 
provides:
2. All rules and regulations 
adopted after the effectivity of the Administrative Code of 1987, which 
date is on November 23, 1989, must be filed with the U.P. Law Center by 
either the adopting agency or the implementing agency of the Executive 
Department authorized to issue rules and regulations and said rules and 
regulations shall be effective, in addition to other rule-making 
requirements by law not inconsistent with the provisions of this Code, 
fifteen days from the date of their filing with the U.P. Law Center 
unless a different date is fixed by law, or specified in the rule in 
cases of imminent danger to public health, safety, and welfare, the 
existence of which must be expressed in a statement accompanying the 
rule. The agency shall take appropriate measures to make emergency rules
 known to persons who may be affected by them. 

The agency should be advised to inform the 
U.P. Law Center of the date of effectivity of each rule and when 
publication in a newspaper is required, to furnish the date/dates of the
 newspapers where published
. In such a case the counting 
should be reckoned with the last date of publication.
[23]
 (Emphasis 
supplied)
VI
Admittedly,
 not all administrative issuances are required to be filed with the 
Office of the National Administrative Register.
[24]
 Nevertheless, it is my opinion that
 the circulars in this case affect third parties. The hazard pay and 
other benefits of public health workers affect third parties because the
 grant of these benefits involves the use of public funds. 

Parenthetically, all Department of Budget and 
Management circulars affect the public because the Departmentâs 
circulars involve the use of public funds collected from taxpayers. 
Hence, all Department of Budget and Management circulars must be 
deposited with the Office of the National Administrative 
Register.
[25]
 
Taxpayers have the right to know where public funds were used and for 
what reasons. There is no harm in requiring that circulars be deposited 
with the Office of the National Administrative Register. In fact, the 
requirement that rules must be deposited with the Office of the National
 Administrative Register can be easily complied with. To opt not to 
deposit a rule with the Office of the National Administrative Register 
is suspect for the public has the right to be informed of government 
rules and regulations, more so if the rule involves the use of public 
funds. 
ACCORDINGLY, I concur in the result.

Joint Resolution No. 4
 was dated July 28, 2008 and was approved by then President Gloria 
Macapagal-Arroyo on June 17, 2009.
[10] 
Joint Resolution No. 4
 (2008), item 6 provides:
(6) Magna Carta Benefits â 
Within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Joint Resolution, 
the DBM is hereby authorized to issue the necessary guidelines, rules 
and regulations on the grant of Magna Carta benefits authorized for 
specific officials and employees in the government to determine those 
that may be categorized in the Total Compensation 
Framework.
Nothing in this Joint Resolution shall be 
interpreted to reduce, diminish or, in any way, alter the benefits 
provided for in existing laws on Magna Carta benefits for specific 
officials and employees in government, regardless of whether said 
benefits have been already received or have yet to be 
implemented.
The DBM, in coordination with the 
agencies concerned, shall determine the qualifications, conditions and 
rates in the grant of said benefits. 
Accordingly, the 
consultative councils, departments and officials previously authorized 
to issue the implementing rules and regulations of Magna Carta benefits 
shall no longer exercise said function relative to the grant of such 
benefits

 Const., art. VI, secs. 26 and 27 
provide:
SECTION 26. (1) Every 

bill
 passed by the Congress shall embrace only one 
subject which shall be expressed in the title 
thereof.
(2) No 
bill
 passed by 
either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on 
separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been 
distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when 
the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to 
meet a public calamity or emergency. Upon the last reading of a bill, no
 amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be taken
 immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal. 
(Emphasis supplied).
SECTION 27. (1) Every 

bill
 passed by the Congress shall, before it becomes a
 law, be presented to the President. If he approves the same, he shall 
sign it; otherwise, he shall veto it and return the same with his 
objections to the House where it originated, which shall enter the 
objections at large in its Journal and proceed to reconsider it. If, 
after such reconsideration, two-thirds of all the Members of such House 
shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the 
objections, to the other House by which it shall likewise be 
reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of all the Members of that 
House, it shall become a law. In all such cases, the votes of each House
 shall be determined by yeas or nays, and the names of the Members 
voting for or against shall be entered in its Journal. The President 
shall communicate his veto of any bill to the House where it originated 
within thirty days after the date of receipt thereof; otherwise, it 
shall become a law as if he had signed it. 
(2) The 
President shall have the power to veto any particular item or items in 
an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall not affect
 the item or items to which he does not object. (Emphasis supplied) 

On the other hand, the House Rules of the House of 
Representatives specifically 
provides:
Section. 58. Third 
Reading.
 . . .
No bill 
or
 joint resolution
 shall become law unless it passes 
three (3) readings on separate days and printed copies thereof in its 
final form are distributed to the Members three (3) days before its 
passage except when the President certifies to the necessity of its 
immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency. (Emphasis 
supplied) 
With the insertion of âjoint resolution,â 
it seems that Congress intercalated a procedure not sanctioned by the 
Constitution.
