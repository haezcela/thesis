RE: REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED AT THE MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, BALIUAG, BULACAN
R E S O L U T I O N




SERENO, C.J.:


This is an administrative matter stemming from a financial audit conducted at the Municipal Trial Court in Baliuag, Bulacan, on the books of accounts of Ms. Anita S. Cruz, former Clerk of Court; Ms. Adelina A. Ramirez and Ms. Emilia A. Miranda, Officers-in-Charge (OICs)/Clerks of Court of said court, covering the period 1 March 1985 to 31 July 2008.
On 11 March 2009, the Audit Team issued a Financial Audit Report
[1]
. It directed, among others, Ms. Cruz to explain in writing why she should not be held administratively liable for the late remittances of collections for the Fiduciary Fund account, which had accumulated to P1,230,780; and Ms. Miranda to restitute the shortage in the amount of P980,234 and to explain in writing why she should not be administratively dealt with for the shortages incurred for the different fund accounts.
On 11 and 13 March 2009, two separate Memoranda
[2]
 was mailed to the abovementioned court personnel.
In her letter
[3]
 dated 28 April 2009, Ms. Cruz explained that the delay in the remittances of Fiduciary Fund collections amounting to P1,230,780, as of September 2004, admittedly occurred when she lost track of her duties as accountable officer because of family problems and health conditions. She recounted that her mother died of cancer in December 2000. In June 2001, her uncle, who acted as her father, also died of lung cancer. The following year, in April, her brother died of acute leukemia. In May of same year, her father-in-law also succumbed to cancer of the pancreas. In April 2003, her husband died due to heart attack. In 2004, Ms. Cruz herself was diagnosed with colon cancer. Attached to her letter were the Death Certificates of her family members.
On 10 February 2008, Ms. Cruz retired from the service.
[4]
With respect to Ms. Miranda, she failed to comply with the directives addressed to her through Memorandum dated 13 March 2009, which was reiterated in another Memorandum dated 24 September 2009.
[5]
 In a letter
[6]
 dated 11 March 2010, Ms. Miranda filed her resignation as Court Interpreter, effective immediately due to health reasons.
On 15 October 2010, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) issued a Memorandum
[7]
 with the following recommendations:

MIRANDA, former OIC-Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan, for dishonesty, gross neglect of duty, and grave misconduct; and against Ms. Anita Cruz for failure to deposit her collections on time depriving the court of the interest earned if the same were deposited on time;

Presiding Judge CORAZON A. DOMINGO-RAÃOLA be DIRECTED to STRICTLY MONITOR the financial transactions of Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan, in strict adherence to the issuances of the Court to avoid the incurrence of violations committed by Ms. Emilia A. Miranda and Ms. Anita S. Cruz and institute reforms that will strengthen the internal control system in the management of judiciary funds otherwise she will be held equally liable for the infractions committed by the employees under the command/supervision.
We affirm the recommendations of the OCA, with modification.
Being designated as acting Clerk of Court or OIC, Ms. Miranda had the duties and responsibilities of a Branch Clerk of Court. As such, it was her duty to collect and receive, by herself or through a duly appointed cashier, all monies in payment of all legal fees; as well as to receive deposits, fines, and dues. A Clerk of Court, or an acting Clerk of Court, has the duty to ensure full compliance with the circulars of this Court and the Court Administrator on deposits or collections of court funds.
[8]
Clerks of Court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the courtâs funds, revenues, records, properties, and premises. As such, they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard, and physical plant manager thereof.
[9]
 It is the duty of the Clerks of Court to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities. They are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts. It is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds. Clerks of Court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice. Thus, an unwarranted failure to fulfil these responsibilities deserves administrative sanctions and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.
[10]
Ms. Mirandaâs failure to deposit her collections constitutes gross neglect of duties and dishonesty as an accountable officer entrusted with the collection of money belonging to the court.
[11]
 It is a wilful violation of SC Circular No. 3-91, as amended by Circular No. 3-2000, and SC Circular No. 50-95.
While this Court can no longer impose the penalty of dismissal from the service on Ms. Miranda because she has already resigned, such resignation does not render the Complaint against her moot. Resignation is not and should not be a convenient way or strategy to evade administrative liability when a court employee is facing administrative sanction.
[12]
With respect to Ms. Cruz, while she has admitted the delay in the deposit of her collections, she has also explained that the reason for her shortcomings was the series of unfortunate events that befell her and her family for several years. She has further substantiated her claims of the demise of her family members. While her explanation and supporting documents do not absolve her of liability, this Court deems her deserving of compassion and humanitarian consideration. Furthermore, she had already retired in 2008.
WHEREFORE
, this Court finds Ms EMILIA A. MIRANDA, former OIC-Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan, guilty of dishonesty, gross neglect of duty, and grave misconduct. In lieu of the DISMISSAL that her offense carries, which can no longer be imposed by reason of her resignation, Ms. Miranda is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of FORFEITURE of whatever benefits are still due her from the government, except accrued leave credits, if any, that she earned; and is likewise declared to be DISQUALIFIED from employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or âcontrolled corporations.
Ms. EMILIA A. MIRANDA is directed, within ten (10) days from receipt of notice, to do as follows:
RESTITUTE the shortages incurred in the following funds:
