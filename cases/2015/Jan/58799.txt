3. For the Fiduciary Fund (FF):
The audit of the court's Fiduciary Fund (FF) account showed an outstanding balance of Four Hundred Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-Four Pesos (P407,874.00) and upon reconciliation of the said balance against the court's LBP Savings Account, it disclosed a shortage of Seventy-One thousand Nine Hundred Pesos (P71,900.00), which was restituted by RedoÃ±a on March 21, 2013. The detailed computation was presented below:

Out of P60,000 cash bond posted by Dominador A. Lim in Criminal Case No. 6448 on June 26, 2008, only P12,000.00 was reported in the cashbook and monthly report. RedoÃ±a explained in his Letter dated March 13, 2013 that OR Nos. 11922537, 11922538, 11922540 and 11922541 totalling to P48,000.00 were cancelled because of errors in the initial entries, and no collections have been received for the cancelled official receipts. RedoÃ±a denied that he used the court funds, however, it appeared that he allowed the refund of cash bond for the same case on September 14, 2011 amounting to P60,000.00. Also as per Special Power of Attorney executed by Mr. Dominador A. Lim, Dennis V. Lim, Simeon Lim, Luz Omega and Rogelio A. Yu, the accused in Criminal Case Number 6448, they requested to withdraw the cash bail bond in the total amount of P60,000.00, thus, resulting to an over-withdrawal by P48,000.00 for this case.
The audit team surmised that RedoÃ±a to cover up the missing collections, cancelled the original, duplicate and triplicate copies of OR Nos. 11922537, 11922538, 11922540 and 11922441, with a total amount of P48,000.00. However, the photocopies of the original official receipts appended in the case folder were not cancelled (Annexes âH-1â, âH-2â, âH-3â and âH-4â)
For December 2009 monthly report, RedoÃ±a certified in the cashbook and monthly report that no collections were made (Annexes âIâ & âJâ). To conceal collections, RedoÃ±a cancelled official receipt nos. 3503957 and 3503958 amounting to P 12,000.00 and P8,000.00, respectively. (Annexes âKâ & âLâ). As to the amount of P12,000.00 covered by Official Receipt No. 3503957 dated December 7, 2009 from payor Chito Cesar, he explained that due to pure inadvertence and honest lapse on his part, he said the amount was not deposited and it was kept in a safe place in their office only known to him. For OR No. 3503958 dated December 7, 2009 in the amount of P8,000.00, RedoÃ±a allegedly posted cash bail bond for his friend, the accused Raymundo Abarca, out of pity.
After examination of the case folders, the following irregularities were also discovered, to wit:
1. Unreported collection of cash bond for Case No. 03-02-6868 dated March 15, 2011 amounting to P6,000.00. Thus, RedoÃ±a cancelled Official Receipt No. 3503967 to conceal the above missing collections. This was replaced with OR no. 3503973 on May 11, 2011 with the same amount (Annexes âMâ and âNâ). In the cash bond affidavit of undertaking, the accused Mr. Ariel Pirante posted a cash bond in Criminal Case No. 03-02-6868 amounting to P6,000.00 under OR No. 3503967 on March 15, 2011 as evidenced by Annex âOâ, but the said OR No. 3503967 was marked as cancelled in the original, duplicate and triplicate copies.
2. Received P4,000.00 from Florentino Mendoza in Case No. 10-04-6940 on October 29, 2010 under OR No. 3503963, but such amount was unreported/unrecorded and undeposited. To conceal the missing collections, Mr. RedoÃ±a cancelled the above OR (Annex âPâ and âQâ). This was replaced by OR No. 3503970 on May 10, 2011 with the same amount. In the cash bond affidavit of undertaking, the accused Mr. Florentino Mendoza posted a cash bond in Criminal Case No. 10-04-6940 amounting to P4,000.00 under OR No. 3503963 on October 29, 2011 as evidenced by Annex âRâ, but the said OR No. 3503963 was marked as cancelled in the original, duplicate and triplicate copies.
3. Received P4,000.00 from Jayson Cabia in Criminal Case No. 02-08-6961 on March 1, 2011 under OR no. 3503966, but such amount was unrecorded/unreported and undeposited. To cover up the missing collections, RedoÃ±a cancelled the above receipt (Annex âSâ). This was replaced with OR No. 3503972 on May 11, 2011. In the cash bond affidavit of undertaking, the accused Mr. Jayson Cabia Cabudsan, Doroteo Ocenar and six (6) unidentified persons posted a cash bond in Criminal Case no. 02-08-6961 amounting to P4,000.00 under OR No. 3503966 on March 1, 2011 as evidenced by Annex âTâ, but the said OR No. 3503963 was marked as cancelled in the original, duplicate and triplicate copies.
4. Received P2,000.00 from Bernard Mijares in Case No. 04-10-6748 on November 16, 2009 under OR No. 3503956, but such amount was unreported/unrecorded and undeposited. To cover up the missing collections, RedoÃ±a cancelled the above official receipt in the booklet (Annex âUâ). In the case on file, the OR No. has not been marked as cancelled (âAnnex âVâ). In the cash bond affidavit of undertaking in the case record, the accused Mr. Bernard Mijares posted a cash bond in Criminal Case No. 04-10-6748 amounting to P2,000.00 under OR No. 3503956 on November 16, 2009 as evidenced by Annex âW.â

Considering the number of irregularities discovered by the audit team, the team recommended that their audit report be docketed as a regular administrative matter against RedoÃ±a for gross misconduct, gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and delay in the deposit of court collections, and that RedoÃ±a's retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, be forfeited. On March 3, 2014, the Court resolved to re-docket the Report dated November 5, 2013 as a regular administrative matter against RedoÃ±a.
RULING
Time and time again, this Court has stressed that those charged with the dispensation of justice - from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk - are circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. Their conduct at all times must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, must be beyond suspicion. Every employee should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty.
[3]
The guilt of RedoÃ±a is undisputed. The records speak for themselves, 
to wit
: (1) The unreported and unremitted collections with a total amount of P71,900.00 resulting to a shortage of P71,900.00;
[4]
 (2) To cover up for the missing collections, RedoÃ±a cancelled several original receipts, including OR Nos. 11922537, 11922538, 11922540, 11922541, 3503967, 3503973. 3503963, 3503966 and 3503956 (Annexes âFâ, âMâ, âNâ, âOâ, âP', âQâ, âSâ, âUâ); (3) For the December 2009 monthly report, RedoÃ±a issued a certification of âno collectionâ of fiduciary fund (Annexes âIâ and âJâ) and again cancelled official receipts nos. 3503957 and 3503958 (Annexes âKâ and âLâ), amounting to P12,000.00 and P8,000.00, respectively, to cover up for the missing collections; (4) For OR No. 3503958 dated December 7, 2009 in the amount of P8,0000.00, RedoÃ±a allegedly posted cash bailbond for his friend, the accused Raymundo Abarca, out of pity; and (5) in several instances, RedoÃ±a incurred delay for a period of four (4) years and nine (9) months in the remittances of his collections on fiduciary fund.
For his failure to remit the collections on time, RedoÃ±a committed a gross violation of SC Circular No. 13-92 which commands that all fiduciary collections "
shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized depositary bank
." Settled is the role of clerks of courts as judicial officers entrusted with the delicate function with regard to collection of legal fees, and are expected to correctly and effectively implement regulations.
[5]
 Shortages in the amounts to be remitted and the years of delay in the actual remittances constitute gross neglect of duty for which RedoÃ±a should be administratively liable.
Safekeeping of public and trust funds is essential to an orderly administration of justice. No protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the circulars designed to promote full accountability of government funds.
[6]
 Thus, RedoÃ±a's claim of good faith, his forgetfulness and lack of secured storage area for the collections are lame excuses to evade punishment for his neglect of duty.
Clerks of court are not supposed to keep funds for a period of time. They have the duty to immediately deposit their collections with authorized government depositories because they are not authorized to keep those funds in their custody and failure in this regard constitutes gross neglect of duty. The unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability. Moreover, failure to comply with pertinent Court circulars designed to promote full accountability for public funds constitutes grave misconduct.
Equally appalling is the tampering of the court records, such as the unwarranted cancellation of official receipts which were committed with conscious and deliberate efforts to conceal the missing collections thus evincing a malicious and immoral propensity.
Clerks of court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises. As such, they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard and physical plant manager thereof.
[7]
 It is the clerks of courtsâ duty to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities to the end that there was full compliance with function, that of being the custodian of the courtâs funds and revenues, records, properties and premises.
[8]
 They are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts. It is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds. Clerks of court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice. Their office is the hub of adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and concerns. They are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.
By failing to properly remit the cash collections constituting public funds, RedoÃ±a violated the trust reposed in him as disbursement officer of the judiciary. His failure to explain satisfactorily the fund shortage, and fully comply with the Courtâs directives leave us no choice but to hold her liable for gross neglect of duty and gross dishonesty. In 
Lirios v. Oliveros
[9]
 and 
Re: Report on the Financial Audit conducted in the Books of Accounts of Atty. Raquel G. Kho, Clerk of Court IV, RTC, Oras, Eastern Samar
,
[10]
 the Court held that the unreasonable delay in the remittance of fiduciary funds constitutes serious misconduct.
[11]
 Even the restitution of the whole amount cannot erase his administrative liability. Clearly, his failure to deposit the said amount upon collection was prejudicial to the court, which did not earn interest income on the said amount or was not able to otherwise use the said funds.
[12]
The inculpatory acts committed by respondent are so grave as to call for the most severe administrative penalty. Dishonesty and grave misconduct, both being in the nature of a grave offense, carry the extreme penalty of dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification for re-employment in the government service. This penalty is in accordance with Sections 52 and 58 of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
[13]
WHEREFORE
, the Court finds respondent CONSTANTINO P. REDOÃA, former Clerk of Court II of the Municipal Trial Court, Tanauan, Leyte, GUILTY of GROSS MISCONDUCT, GROSS NEGLECT OF DUTY and DISHONESTY. Since he had already retired from the service, the penalty of forfeiture of retirement benefits and privileges, except accrued leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, is instead imposed upon him.
