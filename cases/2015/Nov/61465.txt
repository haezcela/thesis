[ G.R. No. 205915, November 10, 2015 ]


ASSET POOL A (SPV-AMC), INC., PETITIONER, VS. CLARK DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.
JUDGMENT

[BASED ON COMPROMISE AGREEMENT]




BERSAMIN, J.:


The petitioner was the transferee and successor-in-interest of United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank) who were the secured creditors of Mondragon Leisure and Resorts Corporation (MLRC) for its working capital requirements in the development and operation of the Tourism Estate Phase I that eventually became known as the Mimosa Leisure Estate (MLE).
This case was the appeal of the petitioner of the adverse decision promulgated on September 4, 2012 in CA-G.R. SP No. 104129,
[1]
 whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed its petition for 
certiorari 
assailing the June 24, 2008 order issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 62, in Angeles City, Pampanga in Civil Case No. 13926, an action for specific performance and damages brought by the petitioner to compel the respondent to include the claims of the secured creditors in the documents attendant to the bidding for the privatization of the MLE.
[2]
 Also assailed through the petition for 
certiorari 
was the CA resolution promulgated on February 7, 2013,
[3]
 whereby the CA denied its motion for reconsideration.
On August 19, 2015, and still during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent announced that the privatization of MLE would again be open for public bidding.
[4]
 It issued the 2015 Terms of Reference (2015 TOR) setting the submission, opening and evaluation of bids on October 13, 2015. The schedule was later moved to October 27, 2015.
[5]
Acting on the petitioner's 
Very Urgent Motion for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining [Order]/Status Quo Order,
[6]
 the Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on October 21, 2015 to enjoin the respondent, its agents and representatives from implementing the 2015 TOR, or from proceeding in any manner with the disposal of the MLE.
[7]
On November 6, 2015, the parties submitted their 
Urgent Joint Motion to Render Judgment Based on a Compromise Agreement and Lift the Temporary Restraining Order dated October 21, 2015
 for the purpose of terminating their pending disputes. They attached the compromise agreement and its annexes.
The compromise agreement is reproduced verbatim, to wit:

ANTECEDENTS
x x x x
ACCORDINGLY

Upon approval of this Compromise Agreement by the Supreme Court, 
CDC

Asset Pool A [SPV-AMC], Inc. vs. Clark Development Corporation, G.R. No. 205915.
APA
 and 
CDC, within seven (7) working days

Appendix I

APA

CDC
 that were not included and/or omitted in 
Appendix I
 due to the lack of knowledge of the parties or any reason at all, the said cases shall be deemed included and be deemed withdrawn and/or dismissed accordingly.
As agreed and committed by 
APA, MLRC
 shall file the appropriate pleading for the withdrawal and/or dismissal with prejudice of all cases between 
MLRC
 and 
CDC
 listed in 
Appendix II

APA
 to 
CDC within 7 working days

Failure of APA to file or submit the necessary pleading/s under Sections 3 & 4 of this Agreement entitles CDC not to release the amount provided for under Section 7.1 of this Agreement until all the necessary pleadings for the withdrawal and/or dismissal of all cases listed in Appendices I and II are filed or submitted.
The agreed revenue share from the Regency Casino operations will continue to accrue until successful privatization of the MLE.

PhP765 Million
 to be sourced out from the proceeds of the privatization of the MLE shall be released by 
CDC
 to 
APA
 upon signing of the Lease Agreement with the winning bidder of the MLE and payment of the consideration to 
CDC
 pursuant to Section 8 of the 20 February 2004 MOA. This provision shall likewise apply in case of successful privatization in the future.
7.2 Should the ongoing and future privatization fail, 
CDC 
does not have any obligation to release the amount of 
PhP765 Million
 to 
APA
. It is the understanding by the parties that the payment by 
CDC
 to 
APA
 on this regard shall be sourced from the proceeds of the privatization paid to 
CDC
 by winning bidder.
In consideration of the execution and approval by the Supreme Court of this Agreement, both parties further agree as follows:
8.1 All the derivative rights, privileges, interests and obligations of 
APA
 over the MLE or pertaining to the Secured Creditors are hereby waived, consolidated and assigned in favor of 
CDC
.
8.2 The parties shall forever waive all other claims and counterclaims against each other, whether in the form of money claims, damages, attorney's fees and cost of suit, and agree not to file any case of any kind or nature whatsoever arising from the same facts, incident, claim, cause or causes of action.
8.3 The parties hereby accept this Agreement as the full and final settlement of all their claims, rights, and causes of action arising out of or in any way connected with the cases stated in Appendix I of this Agreement.

A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or put an end to one already commenced.
[9]
 According to Article 2029 of the 
Civil Code
, the court shall endeavor to persuade the parties in a civil case to agree upon some fair compromise. The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, provided such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.
[10]
 Once the parties have entered into a compromise, their agreement has the effect and authority of 
res judicata
, but there shall be no execution except in compliance with a judicial compromise.
[11]
 Such means of dispute settlement is an accepted, even desirable and encouraged, practice in courts of law and administrative tribunals.
[12]
WHEREFORE

APPROVES
 the Compromise Agreement dated November 6, 2015; 
RENDERS
 judgment in accordance with its terms and stipulations; and
