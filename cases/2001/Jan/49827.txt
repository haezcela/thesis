The incident took place at about 4 p.m. on May 2, 1993 at Purok IV, Area 5, Laura St., Old Balara, in Diliman, Quezon City.
Milagros Gardon testified on direct examination:

Q:
What was your father doing at that time?
A:
I let him go to sleep because he was a little bit drunk, and I was watching him so that he will not go outside.
 
 
Q:
Why do you say you were watching him so that he would not anymore go out?
A:
Because he was warned by [accused-appellant Cesar Givera] that if he goes outside, he will kill my father.
 
 
Q:
At that time and place while you were watching your father, what else happened if any?
 
 
 
. . . .

What happened to your father after you said he was stabbed or mauled?

Q:
Now, thereafter you heard stones thrown again towards your house, is that correct?
A:
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q:
But just the same, you did not peep out through any opening of your house for safety?
A:
We were already outside when they were stoning the house. We followed him outside.
 
 
 
. . . .

Onying and Cesar, sir.
 
 
Q:
Are you saying that Onying also stoned your father?
A:
No, sir.

Q:
But you stayed in the house, correct?
A:
No, sir. I was outside the house. When the incident happened, I was already outside the house.
 
 
Q:
But because you did not state that you also followed your father as he ran after Cesar, does that mean that you just stayed in front of your house?
A:
We stopped because we already saw the place where my father was stabbed, that is why we did not follow them.
 
 
Q:
How far did they get, using as reference the front door of your house? How far did they get as they ran away?
A:

Q:
Who, Eusebio Gardon, the victim?
A:
Yes, sir.
To prove the fact and cause of death of Eusebio Gardon, the prosecution presented in evidence the testimony
[9]
 of medico-legal officer, P/Maj. Florante Baltazar, given in Criminal Case No. Q-93-44315. The testimony shows that the victim sustained one fatal stab wound possibly caused by a single bladed weapon.
[10]
 In addition, he sustained abrasions in his lower chin, possibly hitting a rough surface, as well as an incised wound caused by a bladed weapon, on his posterior middle left arm.
[11]
 The stab wound appears to be fatal because it pierced the pericardium and left ventricle of the heart, which could be the immediate effect of hemorrhage, shock and eventual death of the victim.
[12]
 A death certificate
[13]
 evidencing the death of the victim was presented by the prosecution.
Accused-appellant testified in his behalf. He was a resident of Laura St., Old Balara, Quezon City at the time of the incident. He denied any involvement in the killing of the victim who was his relative by affinity.
[14]
Accused-appellant claimed that at the time of the incident on May 2, 1993, at around 4:00 p.m., he was having a drink in his cousin's house, some 30 meters away from the victim's house. On the other hand, Maximo Givera and Arturo Gayon were in the victim's house also having drinks. Accused-appellant said he was fetched by his cousin, Recto Gardon, because Maximo and the victim Eusebio Gardon were having an altercation. He went to pacify the protagonists and then led the victim to his house. Without his knowledge, however, Eusebio went back and again engaged Maximo in a fist fight, as a result of which the victim Eusebio was knocked down. Accused-appellant said he was going to help the victim get up, but he saw the victim's son, Ronilo Gardon, coming with a bolo. He, therefore, ran away and left the victim behind. He added, that he did not see if his three companions did anything more than box the victim.
[15]
 Accused-appellant said he learned that the victim had died only two days after the incident.
[16]
Accused-appellant was arrested on May 4, 1996 at the East Avenue Medical Center. He stated that the children of the victim implicated him in the killing of Eusebio Gardon only because he was present when the incident happened.
[17]
On August 29, 1997, the trial court rendered its decision finding accused-appellant guilty of murder. The dispositive portion of its decision reads:
[18]
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Cesar Givera guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as charged.
The accused is hereby sentenced to reclusion perpetua, with the accessory penalties of the law, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P50,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.
SO ORDERED.
Hence, this appeal. Accused-appellant's sole assignment of error is that-
DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF REASONABLE DOUBT, THE COURT A QUO HAS COMMITTED AN ERROR IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED
The appeal has no merit.
First
. The prosecution presented evidence which shows beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant and his companions (Epifanio Gayon, Arturo Gayon, and Maximo Givera), all of whom were convicted of murder in another case, were responsible for the killing of Eusebio Gardon on May 2, 1993. Milagros Gardon's testimony, an excerpt from which is quoted at the beginning of this opinion, is spontaneous, detailed, and consistent. The defense tried to discredit through cross examination, but, as shown earlier, the defense only succeeded in enabling her to give further details of her testimony in chief. There are apparent lapses in the testimony of Milagros, as when she testified that she knew at the very beginning that it was accused-appellant who was stoning their house when in fact, as she admitted, she only knew this because the victim said so. Moreover, it may be doubted whether the victim's other daughter, Laura, was hit by the stones hurled by accused-appellant as she came out of their house, since the door of the house was so narrow that only one person at a time could pass through it. Nonetheless, a close reading of the records will show that indeed it was accused-appellant who was stoning the house because when the witness followed the victim outside, she saw accused-appellant throwing stones at their house. She then saw accused-appellant hitting the victim with stones. In the process, Laura was also hit.
In any event, these discrepancies are minor and insignificant and do not detract from the substance of her testimony. This Court has time and again said that a few discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses referring to minor details and not in actuality touching upon the central fact of the crime do not impair the credibility of the witnesses. Instead of weakening their testimonies, such inconsistencies tend to strengthen their credibility because they discount the possibility of their being rehearsed testimony.
[19]
Thus, according to Milagros Gardon, accused-appellant taunted the victim and challenged him to come out of the house. After succeeding in drawing the victim out of his house, accused-appellant and his companions ganged up on him, kicking and pummeling him and finally stabbing him.
Milagros' testimony belies accused-appellant's claim that he was merely trying to pacify the victim and Maximo Givera and that he ran away because the victim's son, armed with a bolo, charged at him (accused-appellant). There was no reason for the victim's son to want to attack accused-appellant, if the latter was merely trying to help the victim.
Nor is it probable that accused-appellant did not see what his companions did to the victim aside from giving him fist blows and kicks, because according to accused-appellant, he ran away shortly after they had attacked the victim. As accused-appellant said he saw the assailants run way, this could only be after they had been done with their victim.
The defense also tries to discredit the testimony of the other prosecution witness, Melinda Delfin. It is contended that, contrary to her claim, she was not really present at the incident. For this purpose, it is pointed out that she failed to give a sworn statement regarding said incident to the police.
The contention has no merit. As Melinda explained, she did not give a statement to the police because she was told they would call on her later for her statement. Melinda testified:
[20]
Q:
The police did not get your statement because you did not tell them that you were an eyewitness and if it is true, correct?
A:
No, sir.
 
Q:
You were only asked by your relatives - - You testified in this case in the sala of Judge Asuncion after the children of the victim asked you to? Correct?
A:
They did not tell me. I voluntarily testified, sir, because I saw the incident.
 
Q:
What do you mean by saying that you voluntarily testified? Did you just come to court and asked the court to take you as witness in this case?
A:
No, sir, because in the police station the police told me that they will not take my statement. They will just "ihahabol na lang ako."
 
Q:
Did you not inquire from them why your statement will not longer be taken and what do you mean by that "ihahabol na lang ikaw"?
A:
I did not ask because I do not know anything about that. That was the first time that incident happened to my life.
It is noteworthy that both Milagros Gardon and Melinda Delfin knew accused-appellant and the other assailants, and that in fact some of them are related to the witnesses. Accused-appellant has not shown that these witnesses were motivated by ill will against him. As correctly observed by the trial court:
[21]
[T]he court has no reason to doubt the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.
In the first place, accused Cesar Givera has not shown any motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to testify as they did against said accused.
Second, accused Cesar Givera and the other accused in this case are all residing within the vicinity where the crime was committed, and are even related by affinity to the deceased. There is, therefore, no reason to doubt their identification by the prosecution witnesses."
All things considered, we think the trial court correctly dismissed accused-appellant's claim and gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. From the fact that the victim died and that accused-appellant and his companions were the last persons seen with the victim before he died, it can be concluded that they are responsible for the victim's death.
Second
. The allegations of conspiracy in the information have been established. The victim was at home sleeping after coming from a drinking session, when the accused-appellant and his companions stoned his house to force him to come out. When they failed, one of them, Epifanio (Onying) Gayon, went inside the victim's house and told him to come out. Disoriented because he was drunk, the victim went with Onying. Once the victim was outside, accused-appellant pelted him with stones, while Onying started raining fistic blows on him. Then Onying and accused-appellant ran away to lure him to go toward the bridge where the other two, Arturo Gayon and Maximo Givera, were waiting. When the victim reached the place, he was attacked by the gang. He was kicked and boxed by Onying and when Arturo shouted "
Sige todasin na yan
!," Maximo stabbed the victim.
The evidence thus clearly and convincingly shows a coordinated action by the group in the execution of the crime. In conspiracy, it is not necessary to show that all the conspirators actually hit and killed the victim. What is important is that all participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to unmistakably indicate a common purpose or design to bring about the death of the victim. The act of each conspirator in furtherance of the common purpose is in contemplation of law the act of all. Consonant with this legal principle, accused-appellant is guilty of the crime of murder as if he himself dealt the deathblow that sent the victim to his grave.
[22]
Third
. However, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated in this case. Where conspiracy is directly established, with proof of the attendant deliberation and selection of the method, time and means of executing the crime, the existence of evident premeditation can be appreciated.
[23]
 But in an implied conspiracy, such as in this case, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated in the absence of proof as to how and when the plan to kill the victim was hatched or what time elapsed before it was carried out, so that it cannot be determined if the accused had "sufficient time between its inception and its fulfillment dispassionately to consider and accept the consequences." There should be a showing that the accused had the opportunity for reflection and persisted in effectuating his criminal design which the prosecution failed to establish in the case at bar.
[24]
Nor can the qualifying circumstance of treachery be taken into account. The trial court held:
[25]
. . . [T]reachery will also be deduced from the evidence on record. The deceased was unarmed when he was stabbed by on Maximo Givera and boxed and kicked by accused Cesar Givera and two other accused.
. . . From the evidence adduced, accused Givera and Epifanio Gayon taunted and provoked the deceased by throwing stones at him and then lured him to run after them towards the bridge where the other accused were lying in wait ready to pounce on the deceased without risk to themselves as the deceased was then defenseless."
Treachery is the deliberate and unexpected attack on the victim, without any warning and without giving him an opportunity to defend himself or repel the initial assault. For treachery to be appreciated, it must be shown to be present at the inception of the attack, otherwise, even if present at a subsequent stage, it cannot be considered.
[26]
 In the instant case, the victim cannot be said to have been totally oblivious of the impending attack by all the group of accused-appellant. He thus had every opportunity to escape from the attack. In fact, his daughter Milagros testified that prior to the stoning incident, the victim had been threatened with harm by accused-appellant the moment he went out of his house, which is why she stayed beside her father to make sure he did not go out of the house. Indeed, the victim had been forewarned of the danger posed by accused-appellant and his group.
Moreover, by coming out of his house and running after two of the assailants, the victim showed that he was prepared for the attack by accused-appellant and his gang and could have been hardly surprised when he was actually attacked. Treachery must be proven by convincing evidence. The fact that the victim may have been surprised because he had not expected that he would be outnumbered when he saw two other attackers waiting for him under the bridge is not sufficient to show that the victim was completely unaware of the attack that might come from his assailants.
[27]
However, the presence of the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superiority was correctly appreciated in this case. The victim was unarmed and was clearly outnumbered by the four assailants, with one of them armed with a knife.
[28]
Fourth
. Accused-appellant claims that his arrest at the East Avenue Medical Center on May 4, 1996 was made without a warrant. This is not true. He was arrested by virtue of a warrant issued by the court on April 27, 1995. However, as the records show, the warrant of arrest was returned unserved by the arresting officer on June 7, 1995 as accused-appellant could not be found. He was finally found only on May 4, 1996. Now, no alias warrant of arrest is needed to make the arrest. Unless specifically provided in the warrant, the same remains enforceable until it is executed, recalled or quashed. The ten-day period provided in Rule 113, Â§4 is only a directive to the officer executing the warrant to make a return to the court.
[29]
At any rate, accused-appellant must be deemed to have waived his right to object thereto because he failed to move for the quashal of the information before the trial court, entered a plea of not guilty and participated in the trial.
[30]
 As this Court has held, any objection involving a warrant of arrest or procedure in the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise the objection is deemed waived.
[31]
On the matter of the admissibility of the testimony of the medico-legal taken in the first case, involving the three other accused for the death of the same victim, offered in evidence in the case at bar, this Court must declare the same inadmissible. As correctly contended by the defense, because they did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Baltazar, his testimony cannot be used in evidence against accused-appellant. Indeed, where the opposing party failed to cross-examine a witness, this Court in several cases held:
[32]
Oral testimony may be taken into account only when it is complete, that is, if the witness has been wholly cross-examined by the adverse party or the right to cross-examine is lost wholly or in part thru the fault of such adverse party. But when cross-examination is not and cannot be done or completed due to causes attributable to the party offering the witness, the uncompleted testimony is thereby rendered incompetent.
Still and all, the fact and cause of death of the victim had been sufficiently proved by the accounts of the two eyewitnesses, corroborated by the offer in evidence of the death certificate of the victim.
Fifth
. The award of damages by the trial court in favor of the victim should be modified. Aside from the award of P50,000.00 as indemnity, the heirs of Eusebio Gardon are entitled to an award of P50,000.00 as moral damages irrespective of proof thereof.
[33]
WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 102, Quezon City finding accused-appellant Cesar Givera y Garote guilty of murder of Eusebio Gardon y Arrivas and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 with the accessory penalties prescribed by law is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that, in addition to the amount of P50,000.00 to be paid as indemnity, accused-appellant is hereby ordered to pay to the heirs of Eusebio Gardon amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages, plus the costs of the suit.
