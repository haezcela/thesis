BUENA, J.:


This is an appeal by 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45, seeking to set aside the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated April 30, 1999
[1]
 in CA G.R. SP No. 45708 entitled, "Heirs of Pedro Cueto vs. Consolacion Compuesto," which denied the Petition for Review and affirmed the Decision of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board, the dispositive portion of which reads:
"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered declaring petitioner (herein respondent) as the bonafide tenant of landowner Pedro Cueto on the subject land holding, ordering the substituted respondents:
"1. To return the physical possession and cultivation of the subject property to herein petitioner.
"2. To respect and desist from further disturbing petitioner in her possession/cultivation of the subject land.
"All claims and counterclaim are hereby dismissed for lack of legal basis.
"No pronouncement as to cost.
"SO ORDERED."
[2]
On March 20, 2001, after an exchange of pleadings and while the above-entitled case was pending resolution before the Second Division of this Court, the Petitioners and the Private Respondent, by their respective counsels, entered into a compromise agreement.
[3]
 On even date, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Leave to File Joint Motion to Admit Compromise.
[4]
 This Court granted the said motion for leave on July 2, 2001.
[5]
 Thereafter, on August 30, 2001, Petitioners and Private Respondent filed a Joint Manifestation with Motion
[6]
 to approve the said compromise agreement, dated March 20, 2001, which reads:
"The undersigned parties, assisted by their respective counsels, and the Heirs of the Spouses Zacarias and Coleta Buenaagua, represented by Diana B. Leus, have agreed to amicably settle the above-entitled case, under the following terms and conditions:
"COMPROMISE AGREEMENT

"2. That the above-cited division shall be done by vertically dividing the above-described landholding from its middle portion;
"3. That the divided half portion of the involved landholding bounded by a creek and the lands of Francisco Buenaagua and Clemente Coronel will be the portion that will go to respondent Consolacion Compuesto while the half portion of the involved landholding bounded by the lands of Paulino Villano and Zacarias Buenaagua will be the portion that will go collectively to the heirs of Spouses Zacarias and Coleta Buenaagua;
"4. That respondent Consolacion Compuesto and the Heirs of the Spouses Zacarias and Coleta Buenaagua will share equally in the expenses to be incurred in the segregation or division of their above-described respective half portions;

"7. That by virtue of this compromise agreement, the parties hereto have waived and renounced, as they hereby waive and renounced forever, any and all claims and counterclaims of whatever nature and kind against each other arising from and/or by reason of this present case.
"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the undersigned parties most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that the foregoing compromise agreement be approved and on the basis thereof, a decision be rendered in the above-entitled case, without pronouncement as to costs.
