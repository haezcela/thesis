A human being who indulges in an incest relationship descends, it is said, to the level of the beast and manifests a depravity of the worst kind.
[1]
At bar is a mandated automatic review on the findings of the Regional Trial Court ("RTC"), Branch 55, of Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, which has found herein appellant CLAUDIO GALENO guilty, on five (5) counts, of rape committed against his own daughter, Jenny Galeno, decreeing thereby the extreme penalty of death on him.
Appellant CLAUDIO GALENO, a.k.a. "Oding," was charged with the crime of RAPE in each of the following informations -
"`That, sometime in the month of August, 1995, in the Municipality of Himamaylan, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the herein offended party, with lewd design, by means of force, violence and intimidation, and with the use of a deadly weapon, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and/or sexual intercourse with JENNY GALENO y ABKILAN, 17 years old, against her will.'
"and
"`That, sometime in the first week of September, 1995, in the Municipality of Himamaylan, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the herein offended party, with lewd design, by means of force, violence and intimidation, and with the use of a deadly weapon, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and/or sexual intercourse with JENNY GALENO y ABKILAN, 17 years old, against her will.'
"and
"`That, sometime in the second week of September, 1995, in the Municipality of Himamaylan, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the herein offended party, with lewd design, by means of force, violence and intimidation, and with the use of deadly weapon, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and/or sexual intercourse with JENNY GALENO y ABKILAN, 17 years old, against her will.'
"and
"`That, sometime in the third week of September, 1995, in the Municipality of Himamaylan, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the herein offended party, with lewd design, by means of force, violence and intimidation, and with the use of a deadly weapon, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and/or sexual intercourse with JENNY GALENO y ABKILAN, 17 years old, against her will.'
"and
"`That, sometime in the fourth week of September, 1995, in the Municipality of Himamaylan, Province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is the father of the herein offended party, with lewd design, by means of force, violence and intimidation, and with the use of a deadly weapon, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of and/or sexual intercourse with JENNY GALENO y ABKILAN, 17 years old, against her will.'"

Claudio Galeno pleaded NOT GUILTY to the charges.  Joint hearings were conducted, following his arraignment, on the five cases.
The evidence for the prosecution, in substance, was testified to by private complainant.  JENNY A. GALENO, at the witness stand, claimed to be 17 years old, single, a student and a resident of Sitio Limbo, Barangay Nabali-an, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental.  She was raped on five occasions, she said, by her own father.
The first incident occurred in August 1995 when she was barely sixteen years old.  It was noontime.  Not having school classes that day, she was told by her mother to stay home to look after their animals and pets.  Her mother and elder brother were then working in the sugarcane field while her other brothers and sisters were not in the house attending to some other matters.  She was resting inside the room located on the first floor of the house when her father foisted himself upon her, pointed a long sharp bolo at her neck and told her to completely undress.  Overcome by fear, she did just as she was told.  She resisted, although in vain, her father's advances.  After taking off his clothes, he forced her legs open and placed himself on top of her.  She felt pain when he finally succeeded in penetrating her. It took her father about half an hour, doing the "push and pull" motion, until she felt his discharge inside her bleeding vagina.  Withdrawing from her, appellant threatened to kill "them all" if she were to tell on him.
Once, during the first week of September 1995, about midnight, she was roused from bed by her father who already had a knife pointed at her. Her mother was sleeping at the upper part of the house with her other brothers and sisters.  Jerked from sleep, she tried to shout but her father timely covered her mouth with his hand.  She struggled to free herself but he was too strong for her.  He removed her panty, placed himself on top of her and, like before, succeeded in taking her.
A week later, the second week of September 1995, also about midnight, she awoke when her father held both her hands and forthwith covered her mouth.  He spread her legs open and raped her for the third time.  By then, she was determined to report the matter to her mother but as she was about to do so, her father looked at her with piercing eyes while holding a bolo in his hand.  She was immediately silenced.
Around the third week of the same month, at noontime, appellant, armed with the same weapon, forced himself on Jenny.  When she refused to submit to his sexual demands, appellant held her hands, covered her mouth and forced himself on her for the fourth time.
The fifth and last incident happened during the fourth week of September 1995.  It was no different from what she experienced before - except that this time, the sexual assault by her father took place at the second floor of their house.
Alarmed by the fact that her monthly period had failed to arrive, Jenny took "penbid" drugs to induce her menstruation.  On 04 March 1996, by now worried, she consulted Dr. Jocson at the Doctor's Hospital in Bacolod City.  She was discovered to be pregnant.  On 31 May 1996, she delivered a baby boy.  The "
hilot
," ELISA TEJIDO, testified that on 31 May 1996, about two o'clock in the morning, she was fetched by OFELIA GALENO (mother of Jenny) to assist Jenny who evidently was experiencing labor pains. When she asked who sired the child, Jenny answered that it was her father.
The defense, controverting the evidence given by the prosecution, submitted differently.  Appellant Galeno testified that in August 1995, when the alleged rape took place for the first time, he was busily engaged in weeding the sugarcane field with his wife.  The couple did not go home for lunch because they brought along the food with them. It was only in the afternoon that they returned home.  During the first week of September 1995, when the second rape supposedly occurred, he left the house as early as four-thirty in the morning.  His wife joined him a few hours later.  He went home at about four-thirty in the afternoon. Around the second week of September 1995, when the third rape was said to have occurred, he was likewise in the sugarcane field, leaving the house at five o'clock in the morning and going back home at four-thirty in the afternoon.  When the supposed fourth and fifth incidents of rape took place during the third and fourth week of September 1995, he was not home, having left with his wife, with food provisions, at five o'clock in the morning for the sugarcane field where they stayed until about four-thirty in the afternoon.  On the whole, he asserted, there was never an instance when he was home at about noontime.
Later in his testimony, however, he changed tune and admitted having had sexual congress with his daughter.  He testified:
"QUESTION:
In the course of your testimony you admitted having a sexual intercourse with Gina?
"ANSWER:
Yes, sir.
"QUESTION:
How may times?
"ANSWER:
I cannot remember how many times.
"QUESTION:
But the fact is there were many times?
"ANSWER:
I just cannot be sure.
"QUESTION:
Could have it been twice?
"ANSWER:
Maybe more than two (2) times.
"QUESTION:
Four (4) times.
"ANSWER:
Maybe around that number.
"QUESTION:
But definitely it was not six (6) times?
"ANSWER:
No, sir.
"x x x                                        x x x                                  x x x
"QUESTION:
The first time you fuck your daughter Jenny was she still studying?
"ANSWER:
Yes, sir.
"QUESTION:
Where did you fuck your daughter the first time, in what place?
"ANSWER:
In our house.
"QUESTION:
What time did you did it happen?
"ANSWER:
Night time.
"QUESTION:
The second time?
"ANSWER:
During the day time.
"QUESTION:
Were you not confused that it might be at the first time in the noon and second, evening?
"ANSWER:
I am sure the first time was during night time and the second time day time.
"QUESTION:
During 3rd time?
"ANSWER:
Also day time.
"QUESTION:
The 4th time?
"ANSWER:
Also day time."
[3]
After hearing both parties at the trial, the court 
a quo
 passed judgment thusly:
"WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises and considerations, the court finds the accused, Claudio Galeno y Magbanua alias `Oding', guilty beyond reasonable doubt of five (5) counts of rape and he is hereby sentenced to suffer five (5) death penalties.
"The accused is hereby ordered to indemnify the victim the sum of P250,000.00 with accessory penalties."
[4]
In his appeal to this Court, the convicted accused assigned a lone but encompassing error -
"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT CLAUDIO GALENO Y MAGBANUA GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF FIVE (5) COUNTS OF RAPE AND IN SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER FIVE (5) DEATH PENALTIES"
[5]
 -
bewailing his conviction and the imposition of the penalty of death by the trial court.
Appellant would have it that the coitus between him and his daughter were all consensual.  She never had once resisted, he argued, in any of the incidents of rape complained of. No weapon was used, nor was force or intimidation employed, in their sexual intercourse.  The complainant had all the opportunity to report the matter to her mother, brothers or sisters, or to the police, but she instead kept mum and only mentioned it for the first time when she was discovered to be pregnant. The element of force or intimidation, expressed in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, could not be substituted, appellant would claim, by the mere moral ascendancy or influence he might have had on his daughter.  In any event, he averred, he could only be held guilty of simple rape, the prosecution having failed to conclusively establish that Jenny was under 18 years of age at the time the acts complained of were committed.
Thus, like in most cases of this nature, it is the word of the complainant pitted against that of the accused.  This issue, being one of credibility or that which bears on the veracity of conflicting testimony, this Court would be rightly bound by the evaluation made by the trial judge before whom the declarants have been seen, heard and observed during the oral testimony.
The Court finds no cogent reason to discard the assessment made by the court 
a quo
 giving full credence to the testimony of the complainant and rejecting that of appellant who, in fact, has given a dissonant defense, at first claiming denial and 
alibi
 and then ultimately asseverating consensuality in the incest relationship.  There is no valid justification, upon the other hand, for disbelieving Jenny Galeno whose testimony, the trial court has aptly described, appears to be "spontaneous, unflinching and straightforward."  Thus:
"QUESTION:

[6]
It is said that it would hardly be conceivable for a young lass, such as Jenny in this case, to weave a story against her own father and put the family honor at stake, for no compelling and just cause.  No woman, for that matter, would wish to go through the humiliating trial for such an outrageous offense and senseless depravity unless she truly has been the victim of abuse.
[7]
 The records do not disclose even an attempt to impute ill motives against Jenny other than an alleged intent to conceal an incestuous sexual union.
The defense of "mutuality" is a much-abused defense that often derides the intelligence of a court and only serves to test its patience.  The failure of Jenny to shout or to successfully resist her father do not mean her having necessarily consented to the dastardly acts.  If resistance would be futile, then offering none certainly is no consent by the victim to the sexual act.
[8]
 It is, in fact, a doctrine that in a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the former's moral ascendancy and influence over the latter could be more than sufficient to cow the child-victim to submission.  It is this rationale that the Court would at times state that such ascendancy and influence could be equated to the requisite "violence or intimidation that normally is otherwise characterized by physical acts or uttered threats."
Jenny may have failed to promptly report the matter to her relatives and to the police but that should not imply that her charges have been fabricated.  It is not unknown for rape victims to suffer, initially at least, in silence.  The Court takes judicial notice of a young woman's inbred modesty and shyness and her antipathy in publicly airing acts which blemish her honor and virtue.
[9]
 Rape stigmatizes the victim not the perpetrator.
[10]
Appellant, nevertheless, cannot be meted the capital penalty of death. Under Section 11(1) of Republic Act No. 7659,
[11]
 in relation to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the death penalty may be imposed when the rape victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.  The concurrence of the minority of the victim and her filiation with the accused is essential to qualify the crime and warrant the imposition of the death penalty.
[12]
 The twin circumstances are required to be duly alleged and proved.
[13]
While the father-daughter relationship of herein appellant and the complainant was alleged and established, the latter's minority, however, although similarly alleged, was not satisfactorily established.  Except for the bare testimony of complainant of being still a minor when the offenses charged were committed, no other evidence was adduced to support the statement.  It was not explained why a duly certified certificate of live birth, that could have accurately shown the age of complainant, or a document recognized to be competent evidence
[14]
 for like purpose, had not been duly presented.  Nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime must be substantiated for the extreme penalty of death to be upheld.  Verily, the minority of the victim should not only be alleged but likewise be proved with such equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself.
[15]
Relative to the award of damages in favor of complainant, the Court reiterates the rule that a rape victim is entitled to the grant of P50,000.00 civil indemnity
[16]
 as being the equivalent and in the concept of compensatory damages,
[17]
 a separate award of P50,000.00 moral damages based on a jural foundation that refers to the victim's shame, mental anguish, besmirched reputation, moral shock and social humiliation which rape necessarily brings to the offended party,
[18]
 and a further amount of P25,000.00 exemplary damages on account of the relationship between the accused and the victim that exacerbates the offense.
WHEREFORE, the assailed decision of the court 
a quo
 convicting the accused of five counts of rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that appellant should be, as hereby he is, sentenced to suffer five terms of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay complainant Jenny Galeno P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and P30,000.00 exemplary damages, for each of the five counts of rape or, altogether, a grand sum of P650,000.00.  Costs
