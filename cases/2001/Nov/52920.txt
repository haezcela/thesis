[ G.R. No. 129609, November 29, 2001 ]


RODIL ENTERPRISES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF
APPEALS, CARMEN BONDOC, TERESITA BONDOC-ESTO, DIVISORIA FOOTWEAR AND CHUA HUAY
SOON, RESPONDENTS.

[G.R. NO. 135537.Â NOVEMBER 29, 2001]

RODIL ENTERPRISES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. IDES O'RACCA
BUILDING TENANTS ASSOCIATION, INC., RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


These twin petitions filed under
Rule 45 seek to set aside the Decisions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. Nos.
39919, 36381 and 37243.


Petitioner Rodil Enterprises Inc.
(RODIL) is the lessee of the Ides O'Racca Building (O'RACCA) since 1959.
[1]
 It was a "former alien property" over which
the Republic of the Philippines acquired ownership by virtue of RA 477, as
amended.
[2]


Sometime in 1980 RODIL entered
into a sublease contract with respondents Carmen Bondoc, Teresita Bondoc-Esto,
Divisoria Footwear and Chua Huay Soon,
[3]
 members of the Ides O'Racca Building Tenants
Association Inc. (ASSOCIATION).


On 4 September 1972 the lease contract
between RODIL and the REPUBLIC was renewed for another fifteen (15) years.
[4]
 At that time the O'RACCA was under the administration
of the 
Building Services and Real Property Management Office
 (BSRPMO)
then headed by Director Jesus R. Factora.
[5]


On 12 September 1982 BP 233
[6]
 was enacted.  It authorized the sale of "former alien properties" classified
as commercial and industrial, and the O'RACCA building was classified as
commercial property.
[7]


On 8 January 1987 RODIL offered to
purchase the subject property conformably with BP 233 and the REPUBLIC
responded that its offer to purchase would be acted upon once the Committee on
Appraisal shall have determined the market value of the property.
[8]


On 22 July 1997 the ASSOCIATION
also offerred to lease the same building through the 
Department of General
Services and Real Estate Property
 
Management 
(DGSREPM).
[9]


Pending action on the offer of
RODIL to purchase the property, Director Factora of the BSRPMO granted RODILâs
request for another renewal of the lease contract on 23 September 1987 for
another five (5) years from 1 September 1987.
[10]
 The renewal contract was forwarded to then Secretary
Jose de Jesus of DGSREPM for approval.


On 25 September 1987
Undersecretary of DGSREPM Rufino B. Banas recommended to Secrectary De Jesus
the suspension of the approval of the renewal contract because the offer of the
ASSOCIATION was more beneficial to the REPUBLIC.


Resultantly, on 30 September 1987
Secretary De Jesus issued another memorandum to Director Factora disapproving
the renewal contract in favor of RODIL, at the same time recalling all papers
signed by him regarding the subject.  Secretary De Jesus likewise directed RODIL to pay its realty tax
delinquency and ordered the issuance of a temporary occupancy permit to the
ASSOCIATION.
[11]


On 6 October 1987 RODIL filed an
action for specific performance, damages and injunction with prayer for
temporary restraining order before the Regional Trial Court of Manila against
the REPUBLIC, De Jesus, Banas, Factora and the ASSOCIATION.
[12]
 RODIL prayed that a restraining order be issued
enjoining the ASSOCIATION or any person acting under it from collecting rentals
from the occupants or sub-lessees of O'RACCA.  On 26 October 1987 the trial court granted the writ of preliminary
injunction.
[13]
 On appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld the issuance
of the writ of preliminary injunction and ordered the deposit of the monthly
rentals with the lower court 
pendente lite.


On 20 November 1987 the REPUBLIC,
De Jesus, Banas and Factora filed their Answer with Counterclaim for
damages.  On 21 December 1987 the
ASSOCIATION also filed its Answer with Counterclaim for damages.


De Jesus, Banas and Factora were
later substituted by Secretary Fulgencio Factoran of the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in the action for specific
performance.  On 31 May 1988 Factoran
issued Order No. 1 designating the Land Management Bureau represented by
Director Abelardo Palad, Jr. as custodian of all  "former alien properties"  owned by the REPUBLIC.


On 18 May 1992 RODIL signed a
renewal contract with Director Palad which was approved by Secretary Factoran.
[14]
 The renewal contract would extend the lease for ten
(10) years from 1 September 1987.  A
supplement to the renewal contract was subsequently entered into on 25 May 1992
where rentals on the previous lease contract were increased.
[15]


On 14 August 1972 the action for
specific performance was dismissed by the trial court upon joint motion to
dismiss by RODIL and the Solicitor General.  The order of dismissal however was appealed by the ASSOCIATION to the
Court of Appeals.
[16]


On 25 September 1992 the spouses
Saturnino Alvarez and Epifania Alvarez, sublessees of RODIL, filed with the
Office of the President a letter-appeal assailing the authority of Factoran to
enter into the renewal contract of 18 May 1992 with RODIL, and claiming the
right to purchase the subject property.
[17]


While the appeal of the
ASSOCIATION from the order of dismissal and the letter-appeal of the spouses
Alvarez were pending, the ASSOCIATION instituted Civil Case No. 92-63833 with
the Regional Trial Court of Manila
[18]
 praying for the setting aside of the renewal contract
of 18 May 1992 as well as the supplementary contract of 25 May 1992, and
further praying for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.  On 3 May 1993 the trial court denied the
prayer for preliminary injunction.


On 30 July 1993 RODIL filed an
action for unlawful detainer against Divisoria Footwear,
[19]
 and on 4 August 1993, a similar action against Chua
Huay Soon.
[20]


On 10 September 1993 the trial
court dismissed the action for declaration of nullity of the lease contract
filed by the ASSOCIATION on the ground of 
litis pendentia
.
[21]
 
The Order
stated that the action for declaration of nullity and the action for specific
performance filed by RODIL were practically between the same parties and for
the same causes of action.
[22]
 This Order was appealed by the ASSOCIATION to the
Court of Appeals.
[23]


On 19 January 1994 RODIL filed an
action for unlawful detainer against respondent Teresita Bondoc-Esto,
[24]
 and on 1 February 1994 filed another action against
respondent Carmen Bondoc,
[25]
 both with the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila.


On 8 February 1994 the Office of
the President through Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. denied the
letter-appeal of the spouses Alvarez, but nullified the renewal contract of 18
May 1992 and the supplementary contract of 25 May 1992.
[26]


Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Trial
Court of Manila upheld RODIL's right to eject respondents Bondoc, Bondoc-Esto,
Divisoria Footwear and Chua Huay Soon,
[27]
 as promulgated in separate decisions the dispositive
portions of which read -

The Regional Trial Court affirmed
the Metropolitan Trial Court
[28]
 in all the four (4) decisions above quoted.  Thus, respondents Bondoc, Bondoc-Esto and
Divisoria Footwear subsequently filed a Petition for Review with the Court of
Appeals,
[29]
 followed by respondent Chua Huay Soon.
[30]


While the consolidated appeals
from the unlawful detainer cases were pending, the Second Division of the Court
of Appeals promulgated its decision on 12 April 1996 with regard to CA-G.R. No.
39919 declaring the renewal contract between RODIL and the REPUBLIC null and
void.
[31]
 RODIL moved for reconsideration but its motion was
denied.
[32]
 Hence, this petition for review on certiorari under
Rule 45.
[33]


On 29 November 1996 the Special
Fourth Division of the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision in CA-G.R. No.
36381 and CA-G.R. No. 37243 setting aside the decisions of the Regional Trial
Court, which sustained the Metropolitan Trial Court, and dismissing the action
for unlawful detainer filed by RODIL against its lessees.
[34]
 RODIL moved for reconsideration but the motion was
denied.
[35]
 Hence, this petition for review on certiorari.
[36]


On respondents' motion, G.R. Nos.
129609 and 135537 were consolidated.


RODIL now contends that the Court
of Appeals erred in annulling its renewal contract with the REPUBLIC and in
dismissing its actions for unlawful detainer against respondents Bondoc,
Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear and Chua.  RODIL claims that the assailed contracts are neither void nor voidable
as the facts show they do not fall within the enumerations under Arts. 1305 and
1409, and an implied new lease still exists by virtue of Art. 1670.  As a result, the right to eject respondents
properly belongs to it.
[37]


With regard to CA-G.R. No. 39919,
RODIL argues that the REPUBLIC, the only defendant who is a real party in
interest, signified its assent to having the action dismissed.  Assuming 
arguendo
 that the
ASSOCIATION was a real party in interest, its counterclaim was nonetheless
unmeritorious.
[38]


On the other hand, respondents
Bondoc, Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear and Chua contend that the lease
contract which the lease contract of 18 May 1992 was to renew, never came into
existence.  Therefore, since there was
no contract to  "renew," the
renewal contract had no leg to stand on, hence, is also void.
[39]
 Respondents then conclude that since there was no
lease contract to speak of, RODIL had no right to relief in its action for
unlawful detainer.  The ASSOCIATION, for
its part, argues that the counterclaim it filed against RODIL cannot be
dismissed because the trial court has not passed upon it.
[40]


We rule for RODIL.  The owner has the right to enjoy and dispose
of a thing, without other limitations than those established by law.
[41]
 Every owner has the freedom of disposition over his
property.  It is an attribute of
ownership, and this rule has no  exception.  The REPUBLIC being
the owner of the disputed property enjoys the prerogative to enter into a lease
contract with RODIL in the exercise of its 
jus disponendi. 
  Hence, as lessor, the REPUBLIC has the right
to eject usurpers of the leased property where the factual elements required
for relief in an action for unlawful detainer are present.


Private respondents claim that the
agreements of 23 September 1987, 18 May 1992 and 25 May 1992 did not give rise
to valid contracts.
[42]
 This is true only of the 
Contract of Lease

entered into on 23 September 1987 which the REPUBLIC did not approve.  RODIL neither alleged nor proved that such
approval was made known to it. The so-called approval of the lease contract was
merely stated in an internal memorandum of Secretary De Jesus addressed to
Director Factora.
[43]
 This is evident from the fact that Secretary De
Jesus, in his letter, asked Factora to duly execute a lease contract and
forward it to his office for approval.
[44]
 The consequences of this fact are clear.  The Civil Code provides that no contract
shall arise unless acceptance of the contract is communicated to the offeror.
[45]
 Until that moment, there is no real meeting of the
minds, no concurrence of offer and acceptance, hence, no contract.
[46]


However, the same is not true of
the contracts of 18 May 1992 and 25 May 1992.  As argued by RODIL, these contracts are not proscribed by law; neither
is there a law prohibiting the execution of a contract with provisions that are
retroactive.  Where there is nothing in
a contract that is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy or
public order, the validity of the contract must be sustained.
[47]


The Court of Appeals invalidated
the contracts because they were supposedly executed in violation of a temporary
restraining order issued by the Regional Trial Court.
[48]
 The appellate court however failed to note that the
order restrains the REPUBLIC from awarding the lease contract only as regards
respondent ASSOCIATION but not petitioner RODIL.  While a temporary restraining order was indeed issued against
RODIL, it was issued only on 25 May 1992 or after the assailed contracts were
entered into.  As correctly stated by
petitioner, one cannot enjoin an act already 
fait accompli
.
[49]


Private respondents argue that the
"renewal contract" cannot "renew" a void contract.  However, they could cite no legal basis for
this assertion.  It would seem that
respondents consider the renewal contract to be a novation of the earlier lease
contract of 23 September 1987.  However,
novation is never presumed.
[50]
 Also, the title of a contract does not determine its
nature.  On the contrary, it is the
specific provisions of the contract which dictate its nature.
[51]
 Furthermore, where a contract is susceptible of two
(2) interpretations, one that would make it valid and another that would make
it invalid, the latter interpretation is to be adopted.
[52]
 The assailed agreement of 18 May 1992, "Renewal
of Contract of Lease," merely states that the term of the contract would
be for ten (10) years starting 1 September 1987.  This is hardly conclusive of the existence of an intention by the
parties to novate the contract of 23 September 1987.  Nor can it be argued that there is an implied novation for the
requisite incompatibility between the original contract and the subsequent one
is not present.
[53]
 Based on this factual milieu, the presumption of
validity of contract cannot be said to have been overturned.


Respondent ASSOCIATION claims that
the Decision of the Office of the President declaring null and void the lease
contracts of 18 May 1992 and 25 May 1992 should be counted in its favor.


We do not agree.  The contention does not hold water.  It is well-settled that a court's judgment
in a case shall not adversely affect persons who were not parties thereto.


Respondent ASSOCIATION  finally argues that the 18 May 1992 and 25
May 1992 contracts can be considered rescissible because they concern property under
litigation and were entered into without the knowledge and approval of the
litigants or of competent judicial authority.
[54]
 Civil Case No. 87-42323 involved an action for
specific performance and damages filed by RODIL against the REPUBLIC and the
ASSOCIATION.  The right to file the
action for rescission arises in favor of the plaintiff when the defendant
enters into a contract over the thing under litigation without the knowledge
and approval of the plaintiff or the court.  The right of action therefore arose in favor of petitioner RODIL and not
respondent ASSOCIATION.


Having preliminarily dealt with
the validity of the lease contracts, we now proceed to resolve the issue raised
by respondent ASSOCIATION with regard to its counterclaim.


The ASSOCIATION argues that its
counterclaim should not have been dismissed.  On this point, we agree.  The
requisites for the application of Rule 17 of the 
Rules of Civil Procedure

are clearly present.
[55]
 The counterclaim is necessarily connected with the
transaction that is the subject matter of the claim.  In malicious prosecution, there must be proof that the
prosecution was prompted by a sinister design to vex and humiliate a person,
and that it was initiated deliberately by the defendant knowing that his charge
was false and groundless.
[56]
 A determination of whether the charge is groundless
would necessarily involve an analysis of whether the action instituted by RODIL
is meritorious.  The counterclaim did
not require the presence of third parties over which the court could not
acquire jurisdiction, and that the court had jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the counterclaim since the amount of damages claimed by the
ASSOCIATION in its counterclaim amounted to 
P
3,500,000.00, clearly
within the jurisdictional amount for the Regional Trial Court under BP 129.


However, in the interest of making
a final adjudication on an issue which has been pending for fourteen (14)
years, we will rule on the issues raised by the ASSOCIATION in its
counterclaim, and accordingly deny the same, dispensing with any discussion
regarding the merits of RODIL's cause of action which is clearly neither
"false" nor "groundless."  Therefore, the elements of malicious prosecution are absent.


As regards the action for unlawful
detainer, respondents Bondoc, Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear and Chua argue
that this should not prosper because RODIL is not in actual possession of the
property and because they are not its sublessees.
[57]
 Their arguments do not convince.


In an action for unlawful detainer
the plaintiff need not have been in prior physical possession.  Respondents have admitted that they have not
entered into any lease contract with the REPUBLIC and that their continued
occupation of the subject property was merely by virtue of acquiescence.
[58]
 The records clearly show this to be the case.  The REPUBLIC merely issued a "temporary
occupancy permit" which was not even in the name of the respondents
Bondoc, Bondoc-Esto, Divisoria Footwear or Chua but of respondent
ASSOCIATION.  Since the occupation of
respondents was merely tolerated by the REPUBLIC, the right of possession of
the latter remained uninterrupted.  It
could therefore alienate the same to anyone it chose.  Unfortunately for respondents, the REPUBLIC chose to alienate the
subject premises to RODIL by virtue of a contract of lease entered into on 18
May 1992.  Resultantly, petitioner had
the right to file the action for unlawful detainer against respondents as one
from whom possession of property has been unlawfully withheld.


Respondents finally argue that
petitioner failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of Rule 45 so that
its petition must be dismissed.  They
allege that petitioner failed to state in its petition that a motion for
reconsideration was filed, the date of filing, when the motion was denied, and
the date when the resolution denying the motion was received.


A cursory review of RODIL's
petition belies respondents' assertion.  All dates required under Rule 45, Sec. 4, are properly indicated except
when the motion for reconsideration was filed.  Procedural rules are required to be followed as a general rule,
but they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate
with the degree of his noncompliance with the procedure required.  Dismissal of appeals purely on technical
grounds is frowned upon and the rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a
very rigid, technical sense, for they are adopted to help secure, not override,
substantial justice, and thereby defeat their very aims.  The rules have been drafted with the
primary objective of enhancing fair trials and expediting the proper
dispensation of justice.  As a
corollary, if their application and operation tend to subvert and defeat,
instead of promote and enhance its objective, suspension of the rules is
justified.
[59]
 Petitioner did not repeat its error in its later
petition filed under G.R. No. 135537.  The oversight must be fashioned with leniency.


WHEREFORE
, the consolidated petitions are GRANTED.  The assailed Decisions of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. Nos. 36381, 37243 and 39919 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  Accordingly, the Decisions of the Regional
