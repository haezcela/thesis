GONZAGA-REYES, J.:


Petitioners, heirs of Anastacio
Fabela, seek to annul the (1) decision of the respondent Court of Appeals dated
June 17, 1999
[1]
 which reversed and set
aside the appealed judgment by default of the Regional Trial Court of Misamis
Oriental, Branch 18, Cagayan De Oro City
[2]
 in Civil Case No.
10459  declaring petitioners as the
rightful owners of subject lot 868 of the Pls. 293 of Balacanas, Nabacaan,
Villanueva, Misamis Oriental, and (2) its resolution dated February 18,
[3]
 2000 denying petitionersâ
motion for reconsideration.


Sometime in December 1985, the
heirs of Anastacio Fabela filed a complaint for reconveyance and damages  against the  heirs of Roque Neri, Sr., involving the subject lot 868, alleging among
others, that plaintiffsâ late grandfather, Anastacio Fabela, left two parcels
of land in Nabacaan, Misamis Oriental which were later identified as lot 868
with an area of 48,121 sq. meters and lot 870 consisting of 15,658 sq. meters
which originally formed part of their grandfatherâs big  tract of land; that earlier in 1924, the
parcel of land became the subject of litigation (Civil Case No. 2891) in the
then Court of First Instance of Misamis Oriental between Carmelino Neri as
plaintiff and Simeona Balhon and children heirs of Anastacio Fabela as
defendants and in connection therewith, the parties entered into an agreement
embodied in an  âEscritura de
transaccionâ, a notarized document in a Visayan dialect,  which provided that Carmelino Neri, as
vendee-a-retro had been entrusted with the possession of a parcel of land for a
period of fourteen (14) years from the date of the instrument which was May 10,
1924 and upon the expiration of said period, Carmelino Neri was to restore the
possession of the property to Simeona Balhon and her children-heirs of
Anastacio Fabela, without need of âredemptionâ; that sometime in 1977 or 1978,
the Bureau of Lands conducted a cadastral survey on this  land when a  road  (Barrio Abacan road) was
constructed across the land dividing it  into two separate lots which are now known as lot 868 and 870; that
Roque Neri Sr. declared these two parcels of land in his name with the Bureau
of Lands and the Assessorâs office; that sometime in 1980, the Philippine
Veterans Industrial Development Corporation (PHIVIDEC), a government entity
buying substantially all real properties at Nabacaan, Villanueva, Misamis Oriental,  negotiated with Roque Neri Sr. for the
purchase of lot 870, however, the heirs of Anastacio Fabela, protested and
consequently, Roque Neri Sr.  executed a
waiver of rights over a portion of lot 870 stating that the 8,000 sq. meter
portion  of lot   870 was erroneously included in his name,
thus plaintiff heirs of Anastacio Fabela  eventually received the proceeds of the sale; that with respect to lot
868, which was the lot in controversy, the late Roque Neri Sr. continued to
ignore plaintiffsâ demand for the return of the said lot.  Plaintiffs prayed for judgment declaring
(1) the plan of lot 868, Pls-293 and  the tax declarations issued subsequent to and  by virtue of aforesaid plan as null and void, (2) the heirs of
Anastacio Fabela as the lawful owners of lot 868, and (3)  the estate of Roque Neri Sr. liable for
payment of damages.


Upon motion of plaintiffs heirs of
Anastacio Fabela,  defendants Sherlinda
Neri Jamisolamin, Emeterio Neri and Antonio Neri, were declared in default on
April 14, 1986, Filomena Neri on September 26, 1986 while Nelchar and Claudia
Neri on February 9, 1989, for their failure to file  answer despite receipt of summons and copy of the complaint. On
the other hand, defendant Roque B. Neri, Jr. had filed his answer with Counterclaim,
but was likewise declared in default for failure to appear  at pre-trial on August 12, 1988.


The case was submitted for
decision on the basis of plaintiffsâ evidence since all the defendants were
declared in default.  After trial and
hearing ex-parte, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, the
dispositive portion reads:
[4]


âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is rendered in favor
of the heirs of the late Anastacio Fabela including those named in the
Complaint as plaintiffs, as co-owners of lot 868, Pls-293 subject of the
complaint and as indicated in the plan (Exhibit D), as such entitled to the
full enjoyment and possession thereof.  All other prayers or claims in the complaint are denied for lack of
merit.â


In finding that the property
belonged to the heirs of Anastacio Fabela, the trial court concluded that in
the âEscritura  de Transaccion,â
Carmelino Neri was obliged to restore the subject property in or about 1938 to
the heirs of Anastacio Fabela; thus the fulfillment of that prestation of
Carmelino Neri was presumed under Section 5, par (ii), Rule 131, Rules of Court
which enumerates among the disputable presumptions  âthat a trustee or other person whose duty it was to convey real
property to a particular person has actually  conveyed it to him when such presumption is necessary to perfect the
title of such person or his successor-in interest.â It thus found that the
Fabela heirs have been in possession of lot 868 since 1938 up to the present
and as such were entitled to the full enjoyment and possession as owners
thereof. 


On July 24, 1989, defendants heirs
of Roque Neri Sr. filed a motion to set aside orders of default and judgment
which the trial court denied in an Order dated August 22, 1989, on the grounds
that the motion had been filed out of time (after judgment) and that even if
such motion would be  treated as a
motion to set aside judgment/new trial under Section 1, Rule 37, 
Rules of
Court
, defendantsâ negligence was not excusable, much less a mistake.
[5]


Heirs of Roque Neri Sr. appealed
to the respondent Court of Appeals. Considering, however,  that the original records of the case from
the trial court had been lost or misplaced, the respondent court, pursuant to
Rule 7 of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (RIRCA), set the
case for preliminary conference on December 17, 1998, which was reset to
January 26, 1999, and  the parties were
informed of the loss of the original records of the case. Counsel for defendants-appellants
heirs of Roque Neri Sr. manifested her clientsâ  willingness to submit the case for decision, even without the
original records and asked for  thirty
days to file memorandum, to which manifestation counsel for
plaintiffs-appellees heirs of Fabela  interposed no objection. The respondent court granted appellantsâ prayer
and gave plaintiffs-appellees twenty days to file  their counter memorandum and appellants ten (10) days to file
reply memorandum, after which the case was submitted for decision.
[6]


On June 17, 1999, the respondent
Court of Appeals rendered its assailed decision reversing the trial courtâs
judgment by default and dismissed the complaint. It sustained the trial courtâs
declaration of default against appellants heirs of Roque Neri, Sr. but found
that the judgment of default was contrary to the evidence or the law. It
concluded that petitioners had not successfully adduced the required
preponderance of evidence on their claim of absolute ownership over lot 868,
the court stated:
[7]


âArt. 434 of the 
Civil Code
 states that âIn an action to
recover, the property must be identified, and the plaintiff must rely on the
strength of his title and not on the weakness of the defendantâs claims.  The possessor of the property has the
presumption of title in his favor.  Hence, any person who claims that he has a better right to the property,
as owner thereof, must prove (1) that he has a better title than the defendant
to the property, and (2) the identity of the property.  The identity of the land sought to be
recovered may be established through the survey plan of the property.  Ownership may be proved by any evidence
admissible in law, such as titles and certificates, long possession and tax
declarations or receipts.


Appellees claimed that Lots 868 and 870 are owned by their grandfather
Anastacio Fabela.  The records of the
Bureau of Lands, as well as the survey plan presented in court, however,  indicate Roque Neri, Sr. as the registered
claimant of both lots.  The original of
the âEscritura de Transaccionâ on which appellees relied   heavily, was not presented in court.  Its probative value, however, remains
doubtful since said document does not really prove appelleesâ absolute
ownership of the subject property, nor was Lot 868 explicitly referred to as
the property being entrusted to the vendee-a-retro (Carmelino Neri).


On the other hand, the waiver of rights executed in 1980 by Roque
Neri, Sr. appears to refer only to a portion of Lot 870 (the parcel of land
sold to PHIVIDEC), and not to Lot 868.  The old tax declaration presented by appellees and which supposedly
covered the two (2) lots did not specify the lot number, nor was there any
evidence presented that the original parcel of land actually consisted of
eighteen (18) hectares.  Their allegation
that both lots have already been partitioned among the heirs of Anastacio
Fabela was not substantiated by any document or writing evidencing such
extra-judicial partition. The fourteen (14) years of the agreed temporary
possession of the land by the defendants-appellants had lapsed a long time ago,
and this was prior to the 1971 public survey conducted by the Bureau of
Lands.  It appears appellees did not
exert diligent efforts to regain possession or resume paying taxes on the land
thereafter, prior to the purchase of Lot 870 by PHIVIDEC.  The fact that appellees were the ones paid
by PHIVIDEC for the portion of Lot 870 does not automatically lead to the
conclusion that they also absolutely own Lot 868.  Most significant yet, is appelleesâ failure to adequately explain
why they  had not at all registered
their claim over the property with the Bureau of Lands during and after the
public survey in the municipality.


Roque Neri, Sr., appellantsâ predecessor-in-interest, meanwhile
registered his claim or interest on the land and declared it for taxation
purposes.  Appelleesâ claim of
possession was through the landâs caretaker and administrator, Delfin Sia, but
at the same time admitting that appellants similarly benefit from  the fruits of the land.  Regarding tax declarations, it has been held
that while tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of
ownership, yet, when coupled with proof of actual possession, they are strong
evidence of ownership. Thus, where it was shown that plaintiff has never paid
the land tax, while the defendant has faithfully done so for many years, there
being no explanation offered, it was held that such payment of taxes should be
taken into consideration in favor of defendant.  Being the exclusive possessors of the subject property who have
declared the same for tax purposes through the years, defendants-appellants are
entitled to such favorable presumption of ownership which so far had not been
overturned by plaintiffs-appellees.


The foregoing considered, it is clear that plaintiffs had not
successfully proved by the required preponderance of evidence their claim of
absolute ownership of Lot 868.  It is an
invariable rule laid down in numerous decisions, that a person who claims the
ownership of property is in duty bound to clearly identify the land claimed, in
accordance with the titles on which he founds (sic) his right to ownership, and
he shall not be  permitted to rely upon
the defects in defendantâs title.  Failure to prove his right of ownership will bar an action to recover
the property; his right to recover must be founded on positive title or right,
and not merely on negative ones, such as the lack or insufficiency of title on
the part of the defendant. The possessor has a presumption of title, and unless
the plaintiff proves he has a better right, he cannot recover the property from
the defendant.â  


Appelleesâ motion for
reconsideration was denied in a resolution dated February 18, 2000.


Hence this petition for review on
certiorari filed by the heirs of Anastacio Fabela alleging that the respondent
court (1) departed from the stringent jurisprudence on default and appeals
filed out of time and (2) erred in the appreciation of the findings of fact of
the lower court. 


Anent the first assigned error,
petitioners fault the respondent court for reversing the decision of the trial
court  despite its complete agreement
with the findings of the trial court that respondents were properly declared in
default. They contend that the reasons cited by private respondents for their
failure to file answer and to appear at the pre-trial were not meritorious and
that private respondentsâ affidavit attached to the motion for reconsideration
did not declare  how Roque Neri Sr.
acquired lot 868. 


We are not persuaded.


Section 1, Rule 18
[8]
 of the old Rules of
Court  which is the law applicable in
the instant case provides:


âJudgment by default- If the defendant fails to answer within the
time specified in these rules, the court shall, upon motion of the plaintiff
and proof of such failure, declare the defendant in default. Thereupon, the
court shall proceed to  receive the
plaintiffâs evidence and render judgment granting him such relief as the
complaint and the facts proven may warrant. This provision applies where no
answer is made to a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint within
the period provided in this rule.â


Favorable
relief can be granted only after the court has ascertained that the evidence
offered  and the facts proven by the
presenting party, petitioners in this case, warrant the grant of the same.
[9]
 In this sense, the law
gives the defaulting parties some measure of protection because plaintiffs,
despite the default of defendants, are still required to substantiate their
allegations in the complaint. The judgment of default against defendants who
have not  appeared or filed their
answers does not imply a waiver of all their rights, except their right to be
heard and to present evidence to support their allegations.
[10]
 Otherwise, it would be
meaningless to require presentation of evidence if every time the other party
is declared in default, a decision would automatically be rendered in favor of
the non- defaulting party and exactly according to the tenor of his prayer.
[11]
 Since the trial court
rendered a judgment of default against private respondents, the latter took the
appropriate remedy which is an ordinary appeal under Section 2 Rule 41, par (3)
[12]
, of the Rules of Court
providing in part as follow:


âA party who has been declared in default may likewise appeal from
the judgment rendered against him as contrary to the evidence or to the law,
even if no petition for relief to set aside the order of default had been
presented by him in accordance with Rule 38.â


Thus,
notwithstanding the respondent courtâs complete agreement with the trial courtâs
findings that all the respondents were properly declared in default, it found
that the judgment by default was contrary to the evidence or the law and thus
reversed the trial court decision.


Anent the second error,
petitioners claim that the respondent court erred in concluding that
petitionersâ predecessor Roque Neri, Sr. appeared as the registered claimant of
lot  868 and 870 which was contrary to
the findings of the  trial court that
the âplan showing lot 868 (Exh. D-2) and lot 870 (Exh. D-1) although appearing
to have been approved by Jose F. Gatus, OIC, Regional Director, on July 17,
1986 does not on its face indicate for whom it had been approvedâ; that Neri
Sr. failed to produce evidence of ownership on how he acquired the subject Lot
No. 868.  They further claim that the
execution in their favor by Roque Neri Sr. of  a waiver of right over lot  870
where the former acknowledged the erroneous inclusion of the lot in his name
was a strong admission against interest on Neriâs part.  They also contend that the respondent court
erred in doubting the probative value of the âEscritura de Transaccionâ only
for the reason that the original was not presented in court.


These arguments essentially raise
factual issues which normally are not reviewable by this Court in a petition
under Rule 45 which is generally limited only to question of law.
[13]
 While certain exceptions to
this rule are recognized such as when  the factual findings  of the
respondent Court of Appeals are at variance with those of the Regional Trial
Court, the Court does not, in all cases of disagreement of facts between these
two courts, automatically delve into the record to determine the facts for
itself.
[14]
 Admittedly, there have been
instances when this Court made independent findings of fact on the points that
the trial court and the appellate court disagreed but we did not do so as a
matter of course. When the dispute between the two courts are merely on
probative value, we limit our review of the evidence ascertaining if the
findings of the Court of Appeals are supported by the  record.  And, so long as
the findings of the said court are consistent with, or not palpably contrary
to, the evidence on record, we decline to make a review on the probative value
of the evidence.
[15]
 In the instant case, We
find no cogent reason to disturb the factual findings of the respondent court
and its conclusion that petitioners failed to establish their case by
preponderance of evidence.


The invariable applicable rule is
to the effect that in order to maintain an action for recovery of ownership,
the person who claims that he has a better right to the property must prove not
only his ownership of the property claimed but also the identity thereof.
[16]
 The party who desires to
recover must fix the identity of the land claimed by describing the location,
area and boundaries thereof.
[17]


In the instant case, petitioners
based their claim of ownership on the  â1924 Escritura de Transaccionâ, the original copy of which was not
presented in the trial court, while the photocopy was also lost when the
original records were elevated to the respondent court. This was the only piece
of evidence that would establish petitionersâ ownership and the identity of
subject lot  868.  In ruling for petitioners heirs of Anastacio
Fabela as the absolute owners of lot 868, the trial court found that in the
Escritura, âit appears that the portion which is now identified as lot 868 had
been entrusted to the possession of Carmelino Neri, as vendee-a retro, for a
period of 14 years from the date of the instrument which was May 10, 1924  and upon the expiration of which said
Carmelino Neri was to restore the possession of the property to Simeona Balhon
and her children heirs of Anastacio Fabela, namely Petra Buenaventura, Julio
and Pedro, all surnamed Fabela, without need of âredemptionâ,â and âthat
fulfillment of Neriâs obligation was presumed to have taken place.â  We note, however, that nowhere in the trial
courtâs narration of facts were the boundaries of the parcel of land indicated
with particularity, nor the parcel of land referring to as lot 868. What really
defines a piece of land is not the area mentioned in its description, but the
boundaries therein laid down, as enclosing the land and indicating its limits.
[18]


Moreover, the testimony of petitioner
heir Teodula Fabela Paguidopon which was quoted in part in petitionersâ own
memorandum
[19]
 did not also clearly
establish the relation of the said âEscritura de Transaccionâ to lot 868, to
wit:


âQ:
   
Now, that bigger lot has
the cadastral lot number before?


A:
     
No because that was not
yet surveyed.


Q:
     
Do you know who owns
this lot?


A:
     
Our grandfather
Anastacio Fabela.


Q:
     
Now while it was still
in the hands of Anastacio Fabela while he was still alive, do you know what was
the total area of the mother lot?  


A:
     
Yes, it was estimated
by our father and we estimated it to be 18 hectares.


Q:
     
Do you have evidence to
prove that it was indeed 18 hectares?


A:
     
Yes, maâam.

I am showing to you an
old document but only a xerox copy thereof entitled  escritura de transaccion notarized by Uldarico Akut in the year

Unfortunately,
the description of the eighteen (18) hectare land which should had been read
and incorporated into the transcript for purposes of record, was omitted in the
quoted portion, to establish the exact location, area and boundary of the 18
hectare lot in relation to lot 868. The omission has created serious doubts as
to the specific  identity of the lot
which petitioners sought to recover. Moreover, even in the petitionersâ
complaint filed before the trial court, there was no allegation of the metes
and bounds of  the subject lot, the
complaint reads: 


â3) a. That the grandfather of plaintiffs-the late Anastacio
Fabela, had left among others, the following property, to wit:


a) Lot 870  


Area:15,658 sq. m.


Location: Nabacaan,
Misamis Oriental


b) Lot 868


Area: 48, 121 sq.m.


Location: Nabacaan,
Misamis Oriental 


b.  That the above
described parcels of land are adjacent to each other as shown by a photocopy of
the sketch plan from the Bureau of Lands hereto enclosed and marked as Annex
âBâ;


c. That these two parcels  since time immemorial used to be one big parcel of land, until in 1977
or 1978, when a government cadastral survey in Villanueva, Misamis Oriental,
was undertaken by the Bureau of Lands, wherein a road was provided and made to
appear across the big parcel of land, causing it to be divided physically and
for which the government surveyors assigned two lots numbers for what used to
be one big parcel of land, thus the appearance of Lot 870 and Lot 868; This
once one big chunk of land never had a cadastral number in the past;â


Notably,
the total area of lots 868 and 870 would only be about 63,679 sq.  meters or about six (6) hectares which fails
to  correspond to the eighteen (18)
hectare parcel of land allegedly owned by the late Anastacio Fabela  which was the subject of the âEscritura de
Transaccionâ and testified to by Teodula Fabela Paguidopon.   Petitioners failed to identify the land with
that degree of certainty required to support their affirmative allegation of
ownership.


Moreover, the respondent court
found, and we agree,  that the waiver
of rights executed in 1980 by Roque Neri Sr., in favor of petitioners referred
only to a portion of lot 870 and not to lot  868.  Thus such waiver which
petitioners capitalized on as an admission against Neriâs interest did not in
any way support petitionersâ claim of ownership of lot 868.  Said waiver reads:
[20]


âACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ADJUDICATION


AND QUITCLAIM


KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:


That I, Roque Neri, Sr., of legal age, widower, Filipino, with
residence and postal address at Villanueva, Misamis Oriental,  Philippines, do hereby ACKNOWLEDGE AND
CONFIRM that the certain portion of a parcel of land located at Balacanas,
Villanueva, Misamis Oriental under Lot No. 870 of Pls. 923 of Villanueva Public
Land Subdivision containing a total area of SIXTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE METERS
(16,0000 sq. m.) which portion is more particularly described as follows:


North  - Roque Neri, Sr.


East  -  Nabacaan Road


West  -  Tayum Creek


South -  Lot 869


containing an area of EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE
METERS (8,000 sq. m.) is hereby adjudicated in favor of the Heirs of Anastacio
Fabela.


That the above described portion of a parcel of land actually
belongs and owned by said Heirs of Anastacio Fabela
.


That the above described portion of land was erroneously
included in the land survey conducted by the Bureau of Lands in my name
.


That I hereby quitclaim and renounce whatever interest, rights and
participation I have over the described portion of real property of which the
Heirs of Anastacio Fabela were the lawful owners.


In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 18
th
 day of August 1980 in Villanueva,
Misamis Oriental, Philippines.


SGD.  ILLEGIBLE


T/ROQUE NERI, SR.â


A simple reading of the instrument
would readily show that only 8,000 sq. meters of the entire 16,000 sq. meters
included in  lot  870  was adjudicated in favor of the heirs of Anastacio Fabela as belonging
to them. In fact, petitioners in their memorandum admitted that only 8,000 sq.
meters was given to them and yet they did not take any positive action to
assert their ownership of the entire lot 870. Petitioners have accordingly no
sound basis to claim lot 868 by virtue of such instrument.  As the appellate court succinctly stated,
âthe fact that appellees were the ones paid  by  PHIVIDEC for the portion of
lot 870 does not automatically lead to the conclusion that they also absolutely
own lot 868.  Most significantly, is
appellees failure to adequately explain why they had not at all registered
their claim over the property with the Bureau of Lands during and after the
public survey in the municipality.â  Finally, petitioners also failed to allege much less establish that they
are in possession of the subject lot. 


On the other hand, the respondent
court found, and this finding was not refuted, that petitionersâ own witness,
Norberto Dumat-ol, a  representative of
the Bureau of Lands, testified that when a cadastral survey was conducted in
1971, the registered claimant of lot 868 based on their official record
was  Roque Neri  Sr.  Petitionersâ allegation that  Neri Sr., committed  fraud in the
registration in his name of these  two
(2) parcels of lot was not substantiated.  The survey plan for lot 868 was approved for Roque Neri Sr. and he had
also declared lot 868 for taxation purposes which was admitted by petitioners
as their complaint prayed for the annulment of the plan and tax declaration.
Although a tax declaration is not considered as conclusive proof of ownership
the same is admissible in evidence to show the nature of the possession of the
claimant of the property for which taxes have been paid.  We accordingly find well-taken the
respondent courtâs conclusion as follows:


âThus,  where it was shown
that plaintiff has never paid the land tax, while the defendant has faithfully
done so for many years, there being no explanation offered, it was held that
such payment of taxes should be taken into consideration in favor of
defendant.  Being the exclusive
possessors of the subject property who have declared the same for tax purposes
through the years, defendants-appellants are entitled to such favorable
presumption of ownership which so far had not been overturned by
plaintiffs-appellees.â


In civil cases, the burden of
proof is on the plaintiff to  establish
his case by preponderance of evidence.
[21]
 If he claims a right
granted or created by law, he must prove his claim by competent evidence. He
must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not upon the weakness of that
of his opponent.
[22]
 When the record does not
show that the land which is the subject matter of the action for recovery of
ownership has been exactly determined, such action cannot prosper, inasmuch as
the petitionersâ ownership rights in the land claimed do not appear
satisfactorily and conclusively proven at the trial.
