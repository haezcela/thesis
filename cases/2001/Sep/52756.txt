PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. GERARDOÂ  DE LAS ERAS Y ZAFRA, ALIAS GERRY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PARDO, J.:


The case is an appeal from the
decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 3, Bohol, City of
Tagbilaran, finding accused Gerardo de las Eras y Zafra, alias Gerry, guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of murder and sentencing him to 
reclusion perpetua

and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Ursula Calimbo in the sum of 
P
16,992.50,
representing actual civil liability and the further amount of 
P
50,000.00
as moral damages.


On March 30, 1992, assistant city
prosecutor of Tagbilaran City Rio C. Achas filed with the Regional Trial Court,
Bohol, at Tagbilaran City, an information
[2]
 charging accused Gerardo de las Eras y Zafra, alias
Gerry, with murder, reading as follows:


âThat on or about the 17
th
 day of February, 1992, in the
municipality of Cortes, province of Bohol, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to
kill and without any justifiable cause, with evident premeditation, taking
advantage of superior strength, and treachery by the suddenness and
unexpectedness of the acts, the victim who was unarmed being then unaware
thereof, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault
and strike several times with the use of a club (hard wood) one Ursula Calimbo,
a defenseless old woman, hitting the latter on the head and other vital parts
of her body, thereby causing her immediate death; to the damage and prejudice
of the heirs of the victim in the amount to be proved during the trial.


âActs committed contrary to the provisions of Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code, as amended, in relation to Article 14, of the same Code.


âCity of Tagbilaran, March 24, 1992.â


On November 13, 1995, the trial
court arraigned the accused.  He pleaded
not guilty.
[3]
 Trial ensued.


On February 17, 1992, at around
7:00 in the evening, Gerome Diola saw accused Gerardo de las Eras (also known
as âGerryâ) within the vicinity of the house of Ursula Calimbo (then
seventy-three years old).
[4]
 Gerome knew accused de las Eras since childhood.  They had a short conversation, then parted
ways.  Shortly after that chance
meeting, Gerome learned that Ursula Calimbo had been struck to death.
[5]


Hilaria Calimbo Binatero, daughter
of Ursula, testified that she lived next door to her mother, their houses
separated only by a fence.  In the
evening of February 17, 1992, she was cooking in her house when she heard her
mother cry for help, âEllen, tabangin ko (Ellen, please help me).â
[6]
 She rushed to her mother and found her bloodied near
the main door.  She asked her what
happened and who was responsible for her condition.  Her mother replied, âGerry.â
[7]


Hilaria testified that on February
10, 1992, she saw accused  de  las  Eras  hiding  behind  the fence of her motherâs house, looking particularly at the back of the
house near the kitchen and the comfort room.  On February 12, 1992, her mother received a pension of 
P
3,000.00.  On February 14, 1992, someone stole the
money.  Her mother suspected accused de
las Eras as the culprit.
[8]


Luisito Redulla testified that he
rushed to the scene of the crime when he heard Ellen (Hilaria Binatero) cry for
help.  He went to the victim and asked
what happened to her and who was responsible, and she answered âGerry, the son
of Pepe and Corning struck her (gibunalan siya).â
[9]
 Incidentally, accused Gerardo de las Erasâ parents
are Felipe, nicknamed Pepe, and Cornelia Zafra de las Eras.
[10]
 Luisito Redulla was the arresting officer when, in
1989, accused Gerry de las Eras was charged with theft.
[11]


Hilaria immediately rushed Ursula
to the hospital, but after one hour, she died.  The family spent 
P
16,992.50 for the interment and burial of the
victim.
[12]


Immediately after the incident,
police took pictures of the 
locus criminis
 showing the deceasedâs
comfort room, a pair of slippers and the hard wood used to strike the victim,
[13]
 part of the kitchen sink which also showed an opening
in the wall,
[14]
 and the door beside the sink which was slightly open.
[15]


In his defense, accused Gerardo de
las Eras invoked denial and 
alibi
.  Early in the evening of February 17, 1992, he accompanied Dedec Carnecer
to have a battery recharged,
[16]
 and after which, he went directly to his grandmother
to buy cigarettes and to have supper.
[17]
 His grandmotherâs house was about one hundred (100)
meters away from the house of the victim.
[18]


After due trial, on April 8, 1998,
the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as
follows:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds accused Gerardo
de las Eras, alias Gerry, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the Crime of
Murder, and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of imprisonment of 
reclusion
perpetua
, to suffer the necessary penalties imposed by law, and to
indemnify the heirs of his victim the sum of 
P
16,992.50, representing
actual civil liability and the further amount of 
P
50,000.00 as moral
damages, but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.


âWithout pronouncement as to Costs.


âSO ORDERED.


âGiven, this 17
th
 day of February, 1998.


â(Sgd.) PACITO A. YAPE


âJudgeâ
[19]


Hence, this appeal.
[20]


In his brief, accused-appellant
raised as issue the prosecutionâs failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.  He contends that the trial court
erred in relying heavily on the dying declaration of the deceased and other
circumstantial evidence.
[21]


We find the appeal without merit.


The trial court, in convicting
accused-appellant, considered the following circumstantial evidence:


(a) That on February 10, 1992 at about 2:00 p.m. or a week before
the incident of February 17, 1992, Gerry was hiding behind the fence of the
victimâs house, near the trunk of a jackfruit tree.  He was observed to be surveying the premises of the house.


(b)  That Ursula Calimbo
received her monthly pension of 
P
3,000.00 on  February 12, 1992, five (5) days before the incident.


(c) That on February 14, 1992, Ursula Calimbo lost her money and
she suspected accused Gerry as the culprit.


(d) That accused Gerardo de las Eras was previously caught,
arrested and convicted of theft before the MCTC of Cortes, Bohol as testified
to by Clerk of Court Abelia Redillas.


(e) That on February 17, 1992 at about 7:00 p.m. before the
incident took place at about 8:00 p.m., accused Gerry was seen by prosecution
witness Jerome Diola.  When asked by
Diola during the brief and chance meeting as to his destination, de las Eras
seemed unable to give a definite answer as he was giving two different
destinations: first, that he was on his way to his brotherâs house; and on the
second, to the bakery of Delfina Boot, as if he were up for some mischief.


(f) That the place where Diola and Gerry parted ways appears to
be some 60 meters away to the house of the victim or a few meters away from the
house of his Lola Naning where he took his late supper.


(g) That accused has a strong motive to kill the victim because he
wanted to silence her for good, at the same time to exact vengeance on the
victim who suspected accused de las Eras to have stolen her pension money.


(h) That when the victim, who was already bleeding on her
brows, when asked as to her assailant, first, by her daughter Hilaria Calimbo
Binatero, and later by SPO3 Lucito Redulla, she mentioned accusedâs name
consistently.  That the accused is known
by his nickname Gerry in the neighborhood, and that is the only Gerry in the
community
.
[22]


Circumstantial evidence suffices
to convict an accused if the following requisites concur: (1) there must be
more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived
are proven; and (3) the combination of all the circumstances produces a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
[23]
 The totality of the evidence must form an unbroken
chain showing beyond reasonable doubt the culpability of the accused.
[24]


The dying declaration made by the
victim immediately prior to her death constitutes evidence of the highest order
[25]
of the  cause  of  her  death  and  of  the  identity  of  the assailant. Under the Revised Rules on Evidence,
[26]
 a dying declaration is admissible provided the
following requisites are present: (1) the statement concerns the crime and
surrounding circumstances of the declarantâs death; (2) at the time it was
made, the declarant was under the consciousness of an impending death; (3) the
declarant would have been competent as a witness had he survived; and (4) the
declaration was offered in a criminal case for homicide, murder, or parricide
in which the declarant was the victim.
[27]
 When asked by her daughter Hilaria Binatero
[28]
and policeman Luisito Redulla,
[29]
 the victim pointed to accused-appellant Gerry de las
Eras as her assailant.  This qualifies
as a dying declaration.
[30]
 


Denial and 
alibi
 are weak
defenses and cannot overturn the positive identification by the prosecution
witnesses of the assailant, more so when there are material inconsistencies in
the testimony of the accused denying his participation in the crime.  In this case,  accused-appellant gave different responses as to his whereabouts
when the crime was committed, thus:


Q:  Do you remember having
testified on June 14, 1996 that at 5:00 p.m., more or less, you were at your
house when Dedec arrived at your house?


A:  Yes.


Q:  And now you are
testifying in answer to the courtâs question that when Dedec went to your
house, it was only your sister whom he met and told your sister to tell you
that Dedec wanted to see you, which is which now?


A:  When Dedec came to our
house, I was at the upper portion of the house.


COURT:  Why are you telling
the court that you were out when Dedec came?


A:  I was at the upper
portion and my sister told me that Dedec was there.


Q:  So you have a talk with
him?


A:  Yes, before we left.


Q:  
So, there are now
four versions
, on July 14, 1996, you said Dedec came to your house to ask
you to help him have his battery charged, on question of the court today, you
answer that you were around the house, on question of Prosecutor Rodolfo R.
Ligason, you said, you were at the upper portion of your house, now, you are
telling the court that your sister told you that Dedec Carnecer was there, and
you have a talk with him, 
which is which now
?


A:  I wish to tell the court
that Dedec Carnecer came to my house, he first see my sister, who told me that
Dedec was around, and I met Dedec, who told me to go to his house.


Q:  So you will not change
your answer anymore?


A:  Yes.
[31]


Accused-appellant also gave
different versions as to where he stayed during the charging of the
battery.  First, he said that they
waited at the store across the whole time that the battery was being charged.  At another time, he said that he went first
to his grandmotherâs house and then came back later to get the charged battery,
thus:


Q:  Is it not a fact that
usually in order to give power to the battery, the battery should be charged
slowly, and therefore, it should be charged overnight and to be taken the
following day?


A:  I do not know.


Q:  Do you mean to say that
after bringing the battery to Igang, after some few minutes, Dedec Carnecer
brought it back to his house?


A:  It was left there for three
hours.


Q:  Do you mean to say that
you waited for that number of hours, three hours?


A:  Yes.


Q:  What time did you
arrive?


A:  Almost 6:30 p.m.


Q:  So, in effect, you
waited until 9:30 p.m?


A:  No, because we went back
to the shop at 8:30 p.m. because Anoy Igang told us to get the battery.


Q:  Did you not tell the
court that you waited for three hours to have the battery charged?


A:  While we waited, Igang
told us to get the battery at 8:30, so we returned to his shop at 8:30 p.m.


Q:  So, it did not take you
three hours to wait after all?


A:  I do not know, because
they were not ones who waited.


Q:  But you came back at
8:30 p.m?


A:  Yes.


Q:  And you were able to get
the battery?


A:  Yes.


Q:  In other words, it only
took you two hours, not three hours?


A:  Yes.


Q:  But why did you tell the
court that you waited for three hours?


A:  Yes, because they were
talking with Dedec Carnecer.


Q:  In other words, it did
not take you about three hours to wait, it only took you 1 Â½ hours?


A:  Yes, that is true.

Q:  While you were on cross,
I heard your answer to the effect that after all, you have the battery charged
for three hours, but in your testimony on June 14, 1996, you said that the
battery was charged at Anoy Igangâs shop for two hours, my question is, did you
deliberately change the two hours to three hours in order to suit the
requirements in charging the battery?


A:  What Anoy Igang told us
when I arrived at 6:30 p.m., that we will come back at 8:30 p.m., because the
battery will be ready by that time.


Q:  Though, you were not
quite responsive to my question, did I get you right just a while ago that you
said that you came back to Anoy Igangâs shop to get the battery?


A:  Yes.


Q:  This is quite a new matter
because when you testified on June 14, 1996, you said that from Anoy Igangâs
shop taking out the battery, you went to the house of Dedec Carnecer arriving
7:30 p.m., leaving 8:00 p.m. going to the house of your lola?


A:  The truth is, we went to
Arsenio Agotâs store and went back at 8:00 p.m. to get the battery.


COURT:  
The court noticed
that most often you are not responsive to the question asked, remember, these
series of questions are vital, since your defense here is alibi
, but on my
notes on your testimony of July 16, you declared that there was no unusual
incident at the store of Agot, in fact, you have been seated at the bench of
the store with Dedec Carnecer, and there was no unusual incident thereat.  And at about 7:00 p.m., you returned to the
shop of Igang and was able to retrieve the battery, and you went home to the
house of Dedec Carnecer, arriving there at 7:30 p.m., it seems that you are
making some conflicting statements.  Do
not answer the question unless you are very sure of your answer.


A:  I was confused because
the question of the fiscal was not in series and sequence.
[32]


Accused-appellantâs defense of
denial and 
alibi
 is further weakened by the fact that he escaped from
detention on May 23, 1992, before his arraignment.
[33]
 On January 21, 1995, he was re-arrested and detained
at the Bohol Detention and Rehabilitation Center (BDRC) for another crime.
[34]
 On June 7, 1997, during the trial of this case,
accused-appellant again escaped from the guard on duty.
[35]
 On December 17, 1997, he was apprehended again.
[36]
 Such escapade is akin to flight before arrest in
 
the
commission of a crime, which is an indication
 
of guilt.
[37]


However, there was no eyewitness
showing how the assailant attacked the victim. Without any particulars as to
the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act which resulted in
the victimâs death unfolded, treachery cannot be appreciated.
[38]
 In the absence of specific evidence proving the
qualifying circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength, absorbed
therein,
[39]
 the crime committed is homicide, not murder.  


WHEREFORE
, the Court AFFIRMS
 
the decision of the
Regional Trial Court, Bohol, Branch 3, Tagbilaran City, in Criminal Case No.
7727, convicting accused-appellant Gerardo de las Eras y Zafra, alias Gerry,
with the modification that in lieu of murder, the Court finds accused Gerardo
de las Eras y Zafra, alias Gerry, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide,
defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.  In the absence of any modifying circumstances
and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby sentences him to
twelve (12) years of 
prision mayor
,  as  minimum, to  seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of 
reclusion
temporal,
 as maximum, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Ursula Calimbo
in the amount of 
P
50,000.00 plus
