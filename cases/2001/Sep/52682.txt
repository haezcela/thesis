MR. AND MRS. VENUSTIANO G. SABURNIDO, COMPLAINANTS, VS.
ATTY. FLORANTE E. MADROÃO,[1]
RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




QUISUMBING, J.:


For our resolution is the
administrative complaint
[2]
 for disbarment of respondent, Atty. Florante E.
MadroÃ±o, filed by spouses Venustiano and Rosalia Saburnido.  Complainants allege that respondent has been
harassing them by filing numerous complaints against them, in addition to
committing acts of dishonesty.


Complainant Venustiano Saburnido
is a member of the Philippine National Police stationed at Balingasag, Misamis
Oriental, while his wife Rosalia is a public school teacher.  Respondent is a former judge of the
Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Balingasag-Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental.


Previous to this administrative
case, complainants also filed three separate administrative cases against
respondent.


In A. M. No. MTJ-90-383,
[3]
 complainant Venustiano Saburnido filed charges of
grave threats and acts unbecoming a member of the judiciary against
respondent.  Respondent was therein
found guilty of pointing a high-powered firearm at complainant, who was unarmed
at the time, during a heated altercation.  Respondent was accordingly dismissed from the service with prejudice to
reemployment in government but without forfeiture of retirement benefits.


Respondent was again
administratively charged in the consolidated cases of 
Sealana-Abbu v. Judge
Madrono, 
A.M. No. 92-1-084-RTC and 
Sps. Saburnido v. Judge Madrono, 
A.M.
No. MTJ-90-486.
[4]
 In the first case, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor
Florencia Sealana-Abbu charged that respondent granted and reduced bail in a
criminal case without prior notice to the prosecution.  In the second case, the spouses Saburnido
charged that respondent, in whose court certain confiscated smuggled goods were
deposited, allowed other persons to take the goods but did not issue the corresponding
memorandum receipts.  Some of the goods
were lost while others were substituted with damaged goods.  Respondent was found guilty of both charges
and his retirement benefits were forfeited.


In the present case, the spouses
Saburnido allege that respondent has been harassing them by filing numerous
complaints against them, namely:


1. Adm. Case No. 90-0755,
[5]
 for serious irregularity, filed by respondent against
Venustiano Saburnido.  Respondent
claimed that Venustiano lent his service firearm to an acquaintance who
thereafter extorted money from public jeepney drivers while posing as a member
of the then Constabulary Highway Patrol Group.


2. Adm. Case No. 90-0758,
[6]
 for falsification, filed by respondent against
Venustiano Saburnido and two others.  Respondent averred that Venustiano, with the help of his co-respondents
in the case, inserted an entry in the police blotter regarding the loss of
Venustianoâs firearm.


3. Crim. Case No. 93-67,
[7]
 for evasion through negligence under Article 224 of
the Revised Penal Code, filed by respondent against Venustiano Saburnido.  Respondent alleged that Venustiano
Saburnido, without permission from his superior, took into custody a prisoner
by final judgment who thereafter escaped.


4. Adm. Case No. 95-33,
[8]
 filed by respondent against Rosalia Saburnido for
violation of the Omnibus Election Code.  Respondent alleged that Rosalia Saburnido served as chairperson of the
Board of Election Inspectors during the 1995 elections despite being related to
a candidate for barangay councilor.


At the time the present complaint
was filed, the three actions filed against Venustiano Saburnido had been
dismissed while the case against Rosalia Saburnido was still pending.


Complainants allege that
respondent filed those cases against them in retaliation, since they had
earlier filed administrative cases against him that resulted in his dismissal
from the judiciary.  Complainants assert
that due to the complaints filed against them, they suffered much moral,
mental, physical, and financial damage.  They claim that their children had to stop going to school since the
family funds were used up in attending to their cases.


For his part, respondent contends
that the grounds mentioned in the administrative cases in which he was dismissed
and his benefits forfeited did not constitute moral turpitude.  Hence, he could not be disbarred
therefor.  He then argues that none of
the complaints he filed against complainants was manufactured. He adds that he
âwas so unlucky that Saburnido was not convicted.â
[9]
 He claims that the complaint for serious irregularity
against Venustiano Saburnido was dismissed only because the latter was able to
antedate an entry in the police blotter stating that his service firearm was
lost.  He also points out that
Venustiano was suspended when a prisoner escaped during his watch.  As for his complaint against Rosalia
Saburnido, respondent contends that by mentioning this case in the present
complaint, Rosalia wants to deprive him of his right to call the attention of
the proper authorities to a violation of the Election Code.


In their reply, complainants
reiterate their charge that the cases against them were meant only to harass
them.  In addition, Rosalia Saburnido
stressed that she served in the BEI in 1995 only because the supposed
chairperson was indisposed.  She stated
that she told the other BEI members and the pollwatchers that she was related
to one candidate and that she would desist from serving if anyone objected.  Since nobody objected, she proceeded to
dispense her duties as BEI chairperson.  She added that her relative lost in that election while respondentâs son
won.


In a resolution dated May 22,
1996,
[10]
 we referred this matter to the Integrated Bar of the
Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report, and recommendation.


In its report submitted to this
Court on October 16, 2000, the IBP noted that respondent and his counsel failed
to appear and present evidence in the hearing of the case set for January 26,
2000, despite notice.  Thus, respondent
was considered to have waived his right to present evidence in his behalf
during said hearing.  Neither did
respondent submit his memorandum as directed by the IBP.


After evaluating the evidence
before it, the IBP concluded that complainants submitted convincing proof that
respondent indeed committed acts constituting gross misconduct that warrant the
imposition of administrative sanction.  The IBP recommends that respondent be suspended from the practice of law
for one year.


We have examined the records of this
case and find no reason to disagree with the findings and recommendation of the
IBP.


A lawyer may be disciplined for
any conduct, in his professional or private capacity, that renders him unfit to
continue to be an officer of the court.
[11]
 Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility
commands all lawyers to at all times uphold the dignity and integrity of the
legal profession.  Specifically, in Rule
7.03, the Code provides:


Rule 7.03. -- A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely
reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he whether in public or
private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal
profession.


Clearly, respondentâs act of
filing multiple complaints against herein complainants reflects on his fitness
to be a member of the legal profession.  His act evinces vindictiveness, a decidedly undesirable trait whether in
a lawyer or another individual, as complainants were instrumental in
respondentâs dismissal from the judiciary.  We see in respondentâs tenacity in pursuing several cases against
complainants not the persistence of one who has been grievously wronged but the
obstinacy of one who is trying to exact revenge.


Respondentâs action erodes rather
than enhances public perception of the legal profession.  It constitutes gross misconduct for which he
may be suspended, following Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, which
provides:


SEC. 27.  
Disbarment or
suspension of attorneys by Supreme Court, grounds therefor
. -- A member of
the bar may be disbarred or suspended from his office as attorney by the
Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such
office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime
involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is
required to take before admission to practice, or for a wilful disobedience
appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do.  xxx


Complainants ask that respondent
be disbarred.  However, we find that
suspension from the practice of law is sufficient to discipline respondent.


The supreme penalty of disbarment
is meted out only in clear cases of misconduct that seriously affect the
standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the court.
[12]
 While we will not hesitate to remove an erring
attorney from the esteemed brotherhood of lawyers, where the evidence calls for
it, we will also not disbar him where a lesser penalty will suffice to
accomplish the desired end.
[13]
 In this case, we find suspension to be a sufficient
sanction against respondent.  Suspension, we may add, is not primarily intended as a punishment, but
as a means to protect the public and the legal profession.
[14]


WHEREFORE,
 respondent Atty. Florante E. MadroÃ±o is found GUILTY
of gross misconduct and is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for one year with
a WARNING
 
that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt
with more severely.  Respondentâs
suspension is effective upon his receipt of notice of this decision.  Let notice of this decision be spread in
respondentâs record as an attorney in this Court, and notice of the same served
on the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and on the Office of the Court
Administrator for circulation to all the courts concerned.
