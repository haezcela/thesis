GONZAGA-REYES,
J.:


This is a petition for
review of the decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals dismissing the
petition to annul the decision of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite,
Branch III,
[2]
 in Reg. Case No. N-440, LRC Rec. No.
26961.  This case stems from proceedings
to annul a 1965 decision of the said land registration court which adjudicated
to private respondents certain parcels of land.


The antecedents are as
follows:  On April 22, 1964, the
Municipality of Bacoor, Cavite, represented by its Mayor, Pablo G. Sarino, sold
Lot Nos. 317, 318, 330 and 356, Psu-164199, with an approximate combined area of
3.1437 hectares, located at Barrio Salinas,
[3]
 in the said municipality, to private
respondentsâ predecessors-in-interest for P188.20 pursuant to Act No. 3312
[4]
 and Municipal Resolution No. 89 as amended
by Resolution No. 289.  Prior to the
sale, private respondentsâ predecessor-in-interest, Brigida Francisco, had been
in possession of the subject lot and paid the real estate taxes thereon as
early as 1907.  On October 27, 1964,
private respondents filed an application for land registration before the
above-mentioned CFI of Cavite, covering the aforesaid lots,  docketed as LRC Case No. N-440, LRC Record
No. N-26961.  On August 4, 1965, a
decision was rendered adjudicating to the applicants, herein private respondents,
the subject parcels of land, as follows:


âWHEREFORE, this Court, confirming its previous order of general
default, hereby adjudges and decrees lots 356, 318, 319 and 330 of plain
AP-1377, AP-1378, AP-1379 and AP-1380, respectively, situated in the barrio of
Salinas, municipality of Bacoor, province of Cavite, free from any liens and
encumbrances to applicants, jointly and equally in undivided shares, in the
following manners:


1. to MARCELA FRANCISCO, widow â 1/3 undivided share.


2. to the HEIRS OF JUANA FRANCISCO, namely:


Â Â Â Â Â  
BUENAVENTURA CRISOSTOMO, married to
Librada Crisostomo;


Â Â Â Â Â  
ANDRES CRISOSTOMO, married to
Esperanza Legaspi;


Â Â Â Â Â  
FELICITAS CRISOSTOMO, married to
Gregorio Javier;


Â Â Â Â Â  
PEDRO CRISOSTOMO, single (these
four own 1/3 undivided share.)


3. to the HEIRS OF BRIGIDA FRANCISCO, namely:


Â Â Â Â Â  
LIWANAG JAVIER, married to
Anastacio Dominguez;


Â Â Â Â Â  
EUDOSIA JAVIER, married to Ernesto
de la Cruz;


Â Â Â Â Â  
AMAPURA JAVIER, married to Angel
Sebastian;


Â Â Â Â Â  
AURORA JAVIER, single;


Â Â Â Â Â  
DOMINADOR JAVIER, married to Luz
Manalili;


Â Â Â Â Â  
FRANKLIN JAVIER, married to Elina
Jose (These six own 1/3 undivided share.)


All applicants are Filipinos, of legal ages, and residents of
Mabolo, Bacoor, Cavite.


Once this decision becomes final, let the corresponding decree of
registration be issued.


SO ORDERED.â
[5]


Pursuant to said
judgment, Decree No. N-105464 and the corresponding Original Certificate of
Title No. O-468 were issued on  October
7, 1965.


Twenty-five years later,
or on October 15, 1990, the Office of Solicitor General (OSG) filed with  the Court of Appeals a petition to annul the
decision of the CFI of Cavite, Decree No. N-105464 and OCT No. 0-468 issued
pursuant thereto; and to order the restoration or reversion of the subject
parcels of land to the mass of the public domain.  The OSG alleged that the registration proceedings were null and void
for lack of jurisdiction because the parcels of land subject thereof  were still classified as forest land, having
been released therefrom only on February 21, 1972; that the OSG was not
furnished with a copy of the application for registration and other records as
mandated by Section 51, of the Public Land Act;  and that the applicants have not shown possession and occupation
of the lands in the manner and for the length of time required by section 48(b)
of the Public Land Act, as amended.  On
August 13, 1992, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision, dismissing for
lack of merit as aforesaid, the petition to annul the Decision dated August 4,
1965 of the CFI of Cavite, Br. III in Reg. Case No. N-440, LRC Rec. No. 26961.
[6]
 The Court of Appeals ruled that âby virtue
of Act 3312 enacted by the Philippine Legislature on December 2, 1926, the
subject lots were previously classified as communal in character; that the
predecessors-in-interest of private respondents were able to purchase subject
lots a
