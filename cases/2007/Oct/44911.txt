BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PETITIONER, VS. GREGORIO C. ROXAS, RESPONDENT. 
D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


For our resolution is the instant Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 assailing the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) dated February 13, 2003 in CA-G.R. CV No. 67980.
The facts of the case, as found by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are:
Gregorio C. Roxas, respondent, is a trader.  Sometime in March 1993, he delivered stocks of vegetable oil to spouses Rodrigo and Marissa Cawili. As payment therefor, spouses Cawili issued a personal check in the amount of 
P
348,805.50.   However, when respondent tried to encash the check, it was dishonored by the drawee bank.   Spouses Cawili then assured him that they would replace the bounced check with a cashierâs check from the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), petitioner.
On March 31, 1993, respondent and Rodrigo Cawili went to petitionerâs branch at Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City where Elma Capistrano, the branch manager, personally attended to them.  Upon Elmaâs instructions, Lita Sagun, the bank teller, prepared BPI Cashierâs Check No. 14428 in the amount of 
P
348,805.50, drawn against the account of Marissa Cawili, payable to respondent.  Rodrigo then handed the check to respondent in the presence of Elma.
The following day, April 1, 1993, respondent returned to petitionerâs branch at Shaw Boulevard to encash the cashierâs check but it was dishonored.   Elma informed him that Marissaâs account was closed on that date.
Despite respondentâs insistence, the bank officers refused to encash the check and tried to retrieve it from respondent.  He then called his lawyer who advised him to deposit the check in his (respondentâs) account at Citytrust, Ortigas Avenue.   However, the check was dishonored on the ground âAccount Closed.â
On September 23, 1993, respondent filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 263, Pasig City a complaint for sum of money against petitioner, docketed as Civil Case No. 63663.  Respondent prayed that petitioner be ordered to pay the amount of the check, damages and cost of the suit.
In its answer, petitioner specifically denied the allegations in the complaint, claiming that it issued the check by mistake in good faith; that its dishonor was due to lack of consideration; and that respondentâs remedy was to sue Rodrigo Cawili who purchased the check.  As a counterclaim, petitioner prayed that respondent be ordered to pay attorneyâs fees and expenses of litigation.  
Petitioner filed a third-party complaint against spouses Cawili.  They were later declared in default for their failure to file their answer.
After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, this Court hereby renders judgment in favor of herein plaintiff and orders the defendant, Bank of the Philippine Islands, to pay Gerardo C. Roxas:

2.)

As to the third-party complaint, third-party defendants Spouses Rodrigo and Marissa Cawili are hereby ordered to indemnify defendant Bank of the Philippine Islands such amount(s) adjudged and actually paid by it to herein plaintiff Gregorio C. Roxas, including the costs of suit.
SO ORDERED.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in its Decision, affirmed the trial courtâs judgment.
Hence, this petition.
Petitioner ascribes to the Court of Appeals the following errors: (1) in finding that respondent is a holder in due course; and (2) in holding that it (petitioner) is liable to respondent for the amount of the cashierâs check.   
Section 52 of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides:
SEC. 52. 
What constitutes a holder in due course
. â A holder in due course is a holder who has taken the instrument under the following conditions:
 
 
 
(a) 
 
That it is complete and regular upon its face; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
 
That he became the holder of it before it was overdue and without notice that it had been previously dishonored, if such was the fact; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) 
 
That he took it in good faith and for value; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d) 
 
That at the time it was negotiated to him, he had no notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of person negotiating it.
 
 
As a general rule, under the above provision, every holder is presumed 
prima facie
 to be a holder in due course.  One who claims otherwise has the 
onus probandi
 to prove that one or more of the conditions required to constitute a holder in due course are lacking.   In this case, petitioner contends that the element of âvalueâ is not present, therefore, respondent could not be a holder in due course. 
Petitionerâs contention lacks merit.  Section 25 of the same law  states:
SEC. 25. 
Value, what constitutes
. â Value is any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.  An antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes value; and is deemed as such whether the instrument is payable on demand or at a future time.
In 
Walker Rubber Corp. v. Nederlandsch Indische & Handelsbank, N.V. and South Sea Surety & Insurance Co., Inc.,
[2]
 this Court ruled that value âin general terms may be some right, interest, profit or benefit to the party who makes the contract or some forbearance, detriment, loan, responsibility, etc. on the other side.â  Here, there is no dispute that respondent received Rodrigo Cawiliâs cashierâs check as payment for the formerâs vegetable oil.   The fact that it was Rodrigo who purchased the cashierâs check from petitioner will not affect respondentâs status as a holder for value since the check was delivered to him as payment for the vegetable oil he sold to spouses Cawili.  Verily, the Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that respondent is a holder in due course of the cashierâs check.
Furthermore, it bears emphasis that the disputed check is a cashierâs check.  In 
International Corporate Bank v. Spouses Gueco
,
[3]
 this Court held that a cashierâs check is really the bankâs own check and may be treated as a promissory note with the bank as the maker.   The check becomes the 
primary obligation of the bank which issues it and constitutes a written promise to pay upon demand
.  In 
New Pacific Timber & Supply Co. Inc. v. SeÃ±eris
,
[4]
 this Court took judicial notice of the âwell-known and accepted practice in the business sector that a cashierâs check is deemed as cash.â  This is because 
the mere issuance of a cashierâs check is considered acceptance thereof
.
In view of the above pronouncements, petitioner bank became liable to respondent from the moment it issued the cashierâs check.  Having been accepted by respondent, subject to no condition whatsoever, petitioner should have paid the same upon presentment by the former.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED
.  The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division) in CA-G.R. CV No. 67980 is 
AFFIRMED
.  Costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.
Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Corona, Azcuna,

Garcia, JJ.,
