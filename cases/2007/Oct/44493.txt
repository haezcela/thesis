ROMONAFE CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.
RESOLUTION




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration of Resolution dated April 16, 2007 with Motion for Leave to File Instant Motion,
[1]
 which this Court treats as a 2
nd
 Motion for Reconsideration, is Denied.  It is a prohibited pleading.
On the clarification
[2]
 being sought by petitioner regarding the actual area of its property subject of Civil Case No. 1140-95 to which the 1995 assessment applies, this Court clarifies that, indeed, the area is 48,103.12 square meters.  The pertinent portion
[3]
 of the Decision of January 30, 2007 is thus amended to read:
It bears clarification, however, that the 1995 assessment applies only to the 
48,103.12
 square meters of Romonafeâs property subject of Civil Case No. 1140-95.
SO ORDERED.
