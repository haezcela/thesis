RUDY A. PALECPEC, JR., PETITIONER, VS.  HON. CORAZON C. DAVIS, IN HER CAPACITY AS THE REGIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES-NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION, MANILA, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




PER CURIAM:


Before the Court is petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration
[1]
 dated 28 August 2007 seeking the reversal of its 
per curiam
 Decision
[2]
 dated 31 July 2007, which denied petitionerâs appeal.
Petitioner was serving as Administrative Officer III of the Interim Internal Audit Division of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National Capital Region (DENR-NCR) when he was dropped from the rolls by the respondent DENR-NCR Executive Regional Director for absences without official leave (AWOL).  The Court affirmed the finding of the Court of Appeals that, except for the period 8-10 May 2000 for which petitioner was granted an approved leave of absence, petitioner had been absent without authorization beginning 2 May 2000, the entire months of June and July 2000, and up to 1 August 2000.  Petitioner was AWOL for a continuous period of more than 30 days for which he was properly dropped by the respondent from the rolls.  Thus, the dispositive portion of this Courtâs Decision dated 31 July 2007 reads:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, we 
DENY
 the present Petition for Review on 
Certiorari 
and 
AFFIRM
 the Decision dated 29 September 2005 and Resolution dated 10 January 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 90292.  We hereby 
ORDER
 that petitioner Rudy A. Palecpec, Jr. be dropped from the rolls of the Plantilla of Personnel of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National Capital Region effective 1 August 2000, with the cancellation of his civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits; and with prejudice to his reemployment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, including government owned and controlled corporations.  Costs against the petitioner.
[3]
This Court finds no cogent reason to reverse its earlier ruling that there is substantial evidence of petitionerâs AWOL for more than 30 days.  However, considering that 
dropping from the rolls due to AWOL
 does not automatically amount to charges of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the public and frequent unauthorized absences, his being 
dropped from the rolls
 due to his AWOL should neither result in the forfeiture of his benefits
[4]
 nor his disqualification from re-employment in the government.
[5]
WHEREFORE
, the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioner is hereby 
PARTLY
 
GRANTED
.  The Decision, dated 31 July 2007 of this Court ordering that petitioner Rudy A. Palecpec, Jr. be dropped from the rolls of the Plantilla of Personnel of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National Capital Region, effective 1 August 2000, for Absence Without Official Leave, is hereby 
AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION
. The provision in the dispositive portion thereof ordering the cancellation of petitionerâs civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and prejudice to his reemployment in any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, including government owned and controlled corporations, is hereby 
DELETED
. Costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.
