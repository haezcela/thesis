GABRIEL L. DUERO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE HON. SANDIGANBAYAN (FIRST DIVISION), RESPONDENTS.

DECISION




QUISUMBING, J.:


From the 
Sandiganbayan
 Resolution
[1]
 dated February 17, 2004, denying the Motion for Reconsideration of the 
Sandiganbayan
 Decision
[2]
 dated June 6, 2003 in Criminal Case No. 11999, petitioner Gabriel L. Duero filed the instant appeal.  The 
Sandiganbayan
 had found petitioner guilty of Malversation of Public Funds, and sentenced him (a) to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of 
prision correccional
 as minimum to ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as maximum, (b) to pay a fine of P46,602.54, and (c) to suffer special perpetual disqualification from holding public office.
[3]
The facts as culled from the records are as follows:
On March 9, 1981, the Commission on Audit (COA) Regional Director for Region XI ordered the examination of the cash and accounts of the Municipal Treasurer and all other accountable officers of, among others, Tandag, Surigao del Sur.
[4]
  On March 16, 1981, the Special Audit Team No. 1
[5]
 went to petitionerâs office, as then Municipal Treasurer of Tandag, to conduct an audit of his cash and accounts from June 3, 1980 to March 16, 1981.  The audit team made the examination from March 16 to May 26, 1981.  They stayed in petitionerâs office for one week but completed the review of the documents in their regional office in Davao City. They returned to Tandag from time to time during the said period.
As testified to by witnesses, Alberto J. Sta. Cruz and Fe B. Ileto, initially, petitionerâs cash and accounts as appearing in his Books of Account yielded an overage of P1,648.02.
[6]
  Upon verification, however, it appeared that certain infrastructure funds from the Ministry of Public Works and Highways (MPH)
[7]
 and interest earned on the municipalityâs time deposit with the Philippine National Bank (PNB) were not entered by petitioner in his Books of Account.  As a result, the audit team amended petitionerâs cash accountability and declared these items as missing funds.
On May 4, 1981, Sta. Cruz sent a written demand to petitioner to produce P339,375.34 and to âtake up [sic] same into account.â
[8]
  Upon verification with the PNB though, the audit team found that the P277,882.01 consisted of simulated deposits and withdrawals that cancelled each other out.
[9]
  Hence, Sta. Cruz sent another written demand to petitioner on May 26, 1981, for the reduced amount of P70,993.33.
[10]
On even date, the audit team submitted to the Regional Director the 
Reports of Examination of the Cash and Accounts
 of petitioner.  Sta. Cruz submitted also a 
Narrative Report
.
[11]
  In both documents, however, the petitionerâs accountability was further reduced to P63,993.33 after the audit team discovered that it was the Provincial Treasurer who received the P7,000 as infrastructure fund.  Sta. Cruz informed the Regional Director that the report was not submitted earlier because the audit team had to verify and re-verify the figures since it involved collections that were not recorded in the Books of Account.  Based on the audit teamâs findings, Sta. Cruz recommended, among others, petitionerâs criminal prosecution for malversation of public funds.
On November 18, 1986, the 
Tanodbayan
 Special Prosecutor filed with the 
Sandiganbayan
 an Information
[12]
 charging petitioner Gabriel L. Duero with Malversation of Public Funds, defined and penalized under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:
That on or [about] the period comprising the year 1980 to 1981, in the municipality of Tandag, Surigao del Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the aforesaid accused being then the Municipal Treasurer of the said municipality, and as such accountable for funds received and collected by him by reason of his office, did then and there, with intent to defraud the government, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with grave abuse of confidence and by taking advantage of his official position, take and appropriate for his own personal use and benefit the amount of Forty Four Thousand Three Hundred Twenty Four Pesos and Five Centavos (P44,324.05), to the damage and prejudice of the government.
Contrary to law.
[13]
Upon arraignment on June 17, 1988, the petitioner entered a plea of not guilty.
[14]
While the case was pending with the 
Tanodbayan
, petitioner filed an Urgent Motion for Reinvestigation/Reconsideration on December 10, 1986.
[15]
  On December 16, 1986, the
 Tanodbayan
 granted the motion.
[16]
  As a result, the COA regional office required Sta. Cruz to comment on the petitionerâs request.  On April 13, 1987, Sta. Cruz submitted his 
1
st
 Indorsement
[17]
 where petitionerâs accountability was further reduced to P46,602.54, after deducting the amounts of P9,890.79 and P7,500, as additional interest earned from the time deposit and purchase of a motor vehicle, respectively.
In his testimony, witness Sta. Cruz revealed that he included certain items
[18]
 amounting to P2,202.72 in petitionerâs accountability.  However, the 
Tanodbayan
 Special Prosecutor deducted these items thereby reducing petitionerâs accountability to P44,324.05, as appearing in the Information.
[19]
The defense presented petitioner himself, Winifredo A. Perez,
[20]
 and Timoteo T. Orquina,
[21]
 as its witnesses during the trial.
Petitioner admitted that the shortage represented certain infrastructure funds from the MPH and unrecorded interest earned on the municipalityâs time deposit with the PNB,
[22]
 which he used to disburse cash advances to the municipalityâs employees and officials.  He said that instead of recording the infrastructure funds in the cashbook, he entered it as accounts receivable in his 
Post Closing Trial Balance as of December 31, 1980
.
[23]
  Further, he did not reflect the funds in his Books of Account because he knew that cash advances are not considered as legitimate disbursements by the auditors.  Petitioner also testified that other than the vale slips, the only evidence he had that the municipalityâs employees and officials made cash advances, were the demand letters he sent to them.  Nevertheless, petitioner claimed that all the cash advances were eventually paid after the audit and he had remitted the amount to the Municipal Treasurer.
[24]
  He restituted the amount on his own first because he knew that the municipalityâs employees and officials who were liable therefor would pay him once they were able.
Perez testified that since the salaries of municipal officials often came late, petitioner allowed them to make cash advances evidenced by vale slips.  Petitioner returned their 
vale
 slips only after their cash advances have been deducted from their salaries.  Sometimes, petitioner allowed them to make additional cash advances although he had not yet liquidated their previous cash advances.
Orquina testified that petitioner allowed him to make cash advances for which he signed
 vale
 slips.  Based on their computation, the two had advanced approximately P9,000 each.  On May 8, 1981, they received separate written demands from petitioner demanding payment of their cash advances.  Perez paid P8,500, while Orquina paid P7,500.  Petitioner returned their vale slips but they could no longer locate it.
On June 6, 2003, the 
Sandiganbayan
 promulgated its decision finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of malversation of public funds. Its dispositive portion reads as follows:
WHEREFORE,
 in view of the foregoing, accused 
Gabriel [L.] Duero
 is hereby 
CONVICTED
 of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code in the amount of P46,602.54, his guilt therefor having been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  Considering his full restitution of the amount malversed which this Court takes as a mitigating circumstance in his favor, and applying provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby imposes upon him the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from eighteen (18) years of 
reclusion temporal
 by way of maximum and ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 by way of minimum.
A fine of P46,602.54, an amount equal to the amount malversed, is imposed, together with special perpetual disqualification from public office.
SO ORDERED.
[25]
Petitioner moved for reconsideration which the 
Sandiganbayan
 denied on February 17, 2004.  Nevertheless, it considered a second mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and modified its decision, to wit:
WHEREFORE,
 the MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION dated June 20, 2003 filed by the accused 
Gabriel [L.] Duero
 of the Decision in Criminal Case No. 11999 promulgated on June 6, 2003 is hereby 
DENIED for lack of merit
.  
The decision is MODIFIED to include the voluntary surrender of the accused as an additional mitigating circumstance
 to full restitution of the amount malversed.  Considering two (2) mitigating circumstances and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the accused is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of 
prision correccional
 as minimum to ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as maximum.  A fine of P46,602.54, an amount equal to the amount malversed, is likewise imposed, together with special perpetual disqualification from public office.
SO ORDERED.
[26]
Hence, the instant appeal.  Petitioner submits that the 
Sandiganbayan
 erred in finding that:
I
. . . THE EXAMINATION AND AUDIT REPORT PREPARED AND CONDUCTED BY THE EXAMINING AUDITORS WAS REGULARLY CONDUCTED AND THE ALLEGED FUND SHORTAGE OF PETITIONER WAS ACCURATELY ESTABLISHED AS BASIS FOR THE PRESUMPTION RELIED UPON FOR HIS CONVICTION OF MALVERSATION.
II
. . . ACTUAL RECEIPT BY PETITIONER OF THE DEMAND REQUIRED FOR THE PRESUMPTION TO ARISE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE.
III
. . . THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PETITIONER TO DUE PROCESS WAS VIOLATED BY NOT ALLOWING RE-EXAMINATION AND RE-AUDIT OF THE ALLEGED SHORTAGE OF THE PETITIONER.
IV
. . . THE TOTALITY OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST PETITIONER IS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH PETITIONERâS GUILT OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
[27]
Otherwise stated, the basic issue is:  Did the 
Sandiganbayan
 err in finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of malversation of public funds?
Generally, the factual findings of the 
Sandiganbayan
 are conclusive on this Court.  However, there are established exceptions, such as when (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise and conjecture; (2) the inference made is manifestly an error or founded on a mistake; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and (5) the findings of fact are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by evidence on record.  In these instances, this Court is bound to review the facts in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.
[28]
After careful perusal of the partiesâ arguments and assiduous examination of the record, we find that such exceptions do not exist in the instant case.  No reversible error was committed by the 
Sandiganbayan
 in its decision convicting the petitioner as charged.
The crime of malversation is defined and penalized under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:
ART. 217. 
Malversation of public funds or propertyâPresumption of malversation.
âAny public officer who, by reason of the duties of his office, is accountable for public funds or property, shall appropriate the same, or shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, or through abandonment or negligence, shall permit any other person to take such public funds or property, wholly or partially, or shall otherwise be guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of such funds or property, shall suffer:
x x x x
4. The penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium and maximum periods, if the amount involved is more than twelve thousand pesos but is less than twenty-two thousand pesos.  If the amount exceeds the latter, the penalty shall be reclusion temporal in its maximum period to 
reclusion perpetua
.
In all cases, persons guilty of malversation shall also suffer the penalty of perpetual special disqualification and a fine equal to the amount of the funds malversed or equal to the total value of the property embezzled.
The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be 
prima facie
 evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal uses.
Petitioner submits that the presumption, as provided under Article 217, last paragraph, cannot arise in this case because the audit conducted by the Special Audit Team was irregular, incomplete, and inaccurate.  He argues, in effect, that the alleged shortage was not established.  More particularly, the petitioner alleged that the audit procedure was tainted by the following flaws and deficiencies:  (1) from an initial finding of an overage, the audit team declared a shortage which it repeatedly revised; (2) the shortage was eventually declared in the COA regional office and not in Tandag, hence, he was not able to sign the document of shortage; (3) no two disinterested persons were present when the shortage was declared; (4) the audit team did not make a formal demand regarding his final accountability; (5) he was not given a notice of pull out of documents and he was not present when the documents were actually pulled out; (6) the audit team failed to examine his 
Post Closing Trial Balance as of December 31, 1980
; and (7) there was a conflict between the amount of shortage determined by the 
Tanodbayan
 and by the audit team.
In our opinion, the 
Sandiganbayan
 properly rejected the allegations on the validity of the audit.  We are inclined to agree with its observation that the protracted audit became necessary because of petitionerâs confusing entries in his Books of Account, his subsequent absence, and the disappearance of some books under his custody, so much so that it had to be the bookkeeper who had to turn over the documents to the audit team when they returned to Tandag to further verify and check the documents.
[29]
  The erroneous computation initially arrived at by the audit team was caused by the simulated entries made by petitioner himself.  The audit team explained the computations adequately and the items in the shortage were sufficiently discussed and explained.  In fact, petitioner did not question the items of shortage.  At best, he merely offered an explanation for the missing funds.
[30]
Our pronouncement in 
Tinga v. People
[31]
 could not apply in the present case, considering the variance in the factual milieu of the cases.  In 
Tinga
, the amount of shortage was disputed because the audit team failed to consider certain records and past transactions of the defendant.  Thus, this Court declared that there was an incomplete and haphazard compliance with the Manual of Instructions to Treasurers and Auditors and Other Guidelines in the examination made by the audit team.
[32]
  We also ruled then that the 
prima facie
 presumption under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code arises only if there was no issue as to the accuracy, correctness and regularity of the audit findings and if the fact that funds are missing is indubitably established.
[33]
In the instant case, petitioner admitted the shortage.  While the audit examination was admittedly replete with errors in determining the correct amount of shortage, the audit team finally determined it to be P46,602.54.  More importantly, they examined all records available.  To repeat, the errors were committed due to petitionerâs simulated entries and not because pertinent documents were disregarded.  In fact, petitioner failed to point any item or record that the audit team overlooked which would have altered his final accountability.  He merely raised the excuse of having utilized the shortage to disburse cash advances to the municipalityâs employees and officials.  Thus, we hold that the presumption stands.
The elements of the offense of malversation of public funds are as follows:  (1) the offender is a public officer; (2) he has the custody or control of the funds or property by reason of the duties of his office; (3) the funds or property involved are public funds or property for which he is accountable; and (4) he has appropriated, taken or misappropriated, or has consented to, or through abandonment or negligence, permitted the taking by another person of, such funds or property.
[34]
Concededly, the first three elements are present in this case.  It is the last element, 
i.e.
, whether petitioner misappropriated said public funds, that serves as the petitionerâs focus.  He claims that he used the missing funds for disbursement of cash advances, and not for his personal use.  The 
Sandiganbayan
 held that this defense is unacceptable, and indicative of petitionerâs guilt.  On this point, we are in agreement.
To begin with, this defense had been advanced in several cases before this Court, but has been found to be without merit.  As held in 
Rueda, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan
 and other cases:
[T]he practice of disbursing public funds under the âvaleâ system is not a meritorious defense in malversation cases.  
The grant of loans through the âvaleâ system is a clear case of an accountable officer consenting to the improper or unauthorized use of public funds by other persons, which is punishable by law.
  To tolerate such a practice is to give a license to every disbursing officer to conduct a lending operation with the use of public funds.
[35]
  (Emphasis supplied.)
Besides, even assuming that petitionerâs defense could be acceptable, no 
vale
 slips evidencing the cash advances were presented before the 
Sandiganbayan
.  True enough, petitioner presented his demand letters
[36]
 to Perez and Orquina for the payment of their cash advances.  Yet, we find the same wanting for failing to state with particularity the exact amounts of cash advances made by these officials. In fact, both of them even testified that their computation varied from petitionerâs own.
To our mind, the evidence in this case is thoroughly inconsistent with petitionerâs claim of innocence.
[37]
  The Sandiganbayanâs decision ought to be affirmed.
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
DENIED
 for lack of merit.  The Decision dated June 6, 2003, and the Resolution dated February 17, 2004, of the 
Sandiganbayan
 in Criminal Case No. 11999, convicting petitioner Gabriel L. Duero of the crime of malversation of public funds, and sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of 
prision correccional
 as minimum to ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as maximum, to pay a fine of P46,602.54, and to suffer special perpetual disqualification from public office, are 
AFFIRMED
