AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:


This resolves the Petition for 
Certiorari
 and Prohibition seeking to set aside the Resolution
[1]
 of public respondent Commission on Elections, 
En Banc
 (COMELEC 
En Banc
) dated January 27, 2004.
Petitioners were the proclaimed winning candidates for the position of 
Punong Barangay
 in their respective 
barangays
 in the municipality of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur in the July 15, 2002 Synchronized 
Barangay
 and 
Sangguniang Kabataan
 Elections (2002 Elections).  Individual respondents were candidates for the position of 
barangay
 chairmen in said 2002 elections, some of whom are 
Punong-Barangays
 proclaimed in the 
barangay
 elections previous to the 2002 elections.
On August 19, 2002, after learning that a Certificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of winning candidates for 
Punong Barangay
 and 
Kagawad ng Sangguniang Barangay
, proclaiming petitioners as winning candidates had been submitted to the COMELEC, respondents filed a petition for declaration of failure of elections and the holding of special elections in the whole municipality of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur and to annul for being void 
ab initio
 the proclamation of petitioners.
[2]
Respondents alleged that the 2002 Elections have not been conducted in thirteen (13) 
barangays
 of Pagayawan on July 15, 2002 for the reason that the official ballots, election forms and paraphernalia, including CEF No. 25, intended for Pagayawan have not been issued or distributed to the Board of Election Tellers (BET) by Acting Treasurer Pangalian Alawi.
[3]
After trial, the COMELEC 
En Banc
 promulgated the herein assailed Decision on January 27, 2004, finding that there was, indeed, failure of elections in the 
barangays
 of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur.  The dispositive portion of the Resolution in question reads as follows:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Commission 
en banc
 
RESOLVED
 as it hereby 
RESOLVES
 to 
ANNUL
 and 
SET ASIDE
 the 15 July 2002 proclamation of the above named Respondents (now petitioners) Punong Barangay respectively in the subject Barangays of the municipality of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur.
ACCORDINGLY
, the Commission 
en banc
 hereby 
ORDERS
:
a) The herein Respondents (now petitioners) namely: Hadji Faisal D. Adap, Mohammadali G. Pangcoga, Allan Ampuan, Cader Carim, Hadji Yusoph Bohary Ampuan, Dathman M. Abbas, Lomala Sarip Cader, Bondiong Comiling, Hadji Omair Sarip Marohom, Ampuan Casim, Pendatun B. Orangot, Aminollah D. Ampuan and Pangcoga Saripoden

No pronouncement as to costs.
[4]
Aggrieved by the foregoing Resolution, petitioners come to this Court, claiming that it was grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the part of the COMELEC 
En Banc
 in (1) declaring failure of elections in 
barangays
 not subject of the petition filed before it; (2) not examining and viewing the election paraphernalia inside the ballot boxes of the questioned precincts of subject 
barangays
; and (3) ordering herein individual respondents, who have been duly proclaimed in the 
barangay
 elections previous to the 2002 Elections, to continue as 
Punong Barangays
 in a hold-over capacity until the holding of special elections.
[5]
The Court reiterates and emphasizes the oft-repeated rule stated in 
Pangandaman v. Comelec
,
[6]
 to wit:
x  x  x  
the propriety of declaring whether or not there has been a total failure of elections  x  x  x  is a factual issue which this Court will not delve into
 considering that the COMELEC, through its deputized officials in the field, is in the best position to assess the actual conditions prevailing in that area.  
Absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion, the findings of fact of the COMELEC or any administrative agency exercising particular expertise in its field of endeavor, are binding on the Court.
  x   x   x 
[7]
  (Emphasis supplied)
The petition is without merit. There is no cogent reason to deviate from the findings of the COMELEC 
En Banc
.  It did not commit any grave abuse of discretion.  It acted well within its jurisdiction when it issued the Resolution of January 27, 2004.
First of all, petitioners' allegation that the COMELEC 
En Banc
 declared failure of elections in 
barangays
 not covered by the respondents' petition is highly inaccurate.  It is not even specified in the Petition which 
barangays
 were not covered by respondentsâ Petition filed with the COMELEC.  Moreover, the COMELEC En Banc, in the Resolution dated January 27, 2004, held that there was failure of elections in the thirteen (13) 
barangays
 subject of respondentsâ petition, namely:  Ngingir Bubong, Ilian, Padas, Pinalangca, Diampaca, Linindingan, Mapantao, Biala-an, Ayong, Reboken-Kamalig (Rubokan), Lumbak (Lumbac), Badaraingud and Madang, and nullified the proclamation of petitioners as 
punong barangays
 of the subject thirteen 
barangays
.
Secondly, it was not necessary for the COMELEC 
En Banc
 to examine and view the election paraphernalia inside the ballot boxes of the questioned precincts of subject 
barangays
, considering that there is substantial evidence on record to convince said body that no elections had actually been conducted.
To refute the claim of failure of elections in subject 
barangays
 of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur, herein petitioners (respondents below) formally offered the following documents as evidence, to wit:
Exhibit 1.  Certification from the Chief of Police of Pagayawan (SPO1 Amerodin T. Baraguer) stating, among other things, that the elections on July 15, 2002 are peaceful and orderly.  To prove that no incident of failure of election was reported to the PNP and Military deputized to safeguard the conduct [of] the aforesaid election.
Exhibit 2.  Certification from the Acting Municipal Treasurer Panangalian Alawi stating, among other things, that the election paraphernalia were properly distributed to the Board of Election Tellers for the eighteen (18) Barangays on July 15, 2002.  To prove that there were indeed elections in Pagayawan as wrongfully pictured by petitioners.
Exhibit 3.  Certification from Minonting Macatumpag, DECS District Supervisor, Municipality of Pagayawan, stating among other things, that the members of the Board of Tellers of the 18 Barangays were recommended and appointed as such.  To prove that there were teachers from the Department of Education and Culture who conducted the election on July 15, 2002 in accordance with Resolution No. 4846 of this Honorable Commission.
Exhibit 4.  Communication dated July 25, 2002 of the Acting Municipal Administrator of Pagayawan Oloden D. Balt refuting the failure of election thereof.  To prove that the report of failure of election in Pagayawan has no factual basis.
Exhibit 5.  Communication dated July 25, 2002 of Mustapha Sarip, Management Officer of Pagayawan, refuting the false report on failure of election.  To prove further that there were indeed elections for barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan in Pagayawan on July 15, 2002.
Exhibit 6.  [Enumeration of submarkings omitted].  Acknowledgement reciept of Official Ballots, election returns and other forms and supplies by the Board of Election Tellers (CE Form No. 14).  To prove that the designated Election Tellers have received the election paraphernalia alloted for Municipality of Pagayawan on July 15, 2002, and subsequently, conducted the election for barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) in accordance with Resolution No. 4846 of this Honorable Commission.
Exhibit 7.  [Enumeration of  submarkings omitted].  Joint Affidavit of the designated Board of Tellers for the 18 Barangays in Pagayawan.  To prove the conduct of election on July 15, 2002 in Pagayawan and refute the distorted report of failure by Election Officer Alican Kapampangan and the petitioners.
[8]
The COMELEC 
En Banc
, however, found the foregoing evidence insufficient to overcome respondents' evidence, to wit:
Although, the Respondents [herein petitioners] have submitted various certifications, its contents appear to be diametrically opposed to what have actually transpired as indubitably established by the following documentary evidence which overcome [sic] and impeached the evidence thus presented by Respondents, to wit:    
The Acknowledgement Receipt executed by Acting Treasurer Pangalian Alawi dated 19 July 2002 effectively destroys the integrity and the evidentiary value of the Certificates of Proclaimation of the Respondents which were all dated 15 July 2002.  Thus, supporting the conclusion that the alleged Certificates of Proclamation were spurious and manufactured. 
The transmittal of the results of the election in Pagayawan by TAHA C. ALI, who is not the Election Officer of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur is in itself questionable because it should be Election Officer of the municipality, Alican Kamampangan, who has the duty to do so. Taha C. Ali, in his memorandum dated 13 January 2002 to Commissioner Mehol K. Sadain, therein admits that there was no reassignment of station that happened.  How could then he served (sic) as Acting EO of Pagayawan.
The Consolidated List of Candidates for the 15 July 2002 Synchronized Barangay and SK Elections of Pagayawan CONFIRMED that certain non-candidates were proclaimed illegally, for the simple reason that they were not candidates for the positions. x x  x
x x x                 x x x                 x x x
In their ANSWER WITH MOTION TO DISMISS, Respondents alleged that EO KAPAMPANGAN assisted Acting Treasurer Pangalian Alawi in distributing the election forms, documents and other paraphernalia.
However, in their memorandum, Respondents contradict themselves by alleging that EO Alican Kapampangan abandoned his duty to supervise the aforesaid elections and was no where to be found after the receipt of the election paraphernalia allocated to Pagayawan on 14 July 2002 by Acting Municipal Treasurer Pangalian Alawi from the Office of the Provincial Treasurer at Marawi City.  That EO Kapampangan only re-appeared after the election on 15 July 2002, that was on 19 July 2002, when the Board of Election Tellers of the eighteen (18) barangays have already proclaimed the winners.

[9]
It should be borne in mind that for this Court to uphold the factual findings of the COMELEC, it only needs to be shown that the same is supported by substantial evidence.
[10]
  Substantial evidence is âthat amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.â
[11]
  In this case, the Court is convinced that the finding of fact made by the COMELEC 
En Banc
, that there was no actual casting of votes in subject 
barangays
 of Pagayawan, Lanao del Sur, is supported by substantial evidence, as discussed in the assailed Resolution dated January 27, 2004.
Lastly, petitioners' contention that it was grave abuse of discretion for the COMELEC En Banc to order herein private respondents to continue as 
Punong Barangays
 in a hold-over capacity until the holding of special elections, is likewise devoid of merit.  In 
Sambarani v. Comelec
,
[12]
 the Court already explained, thus:
x  x  x  Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9164 (âRA 9164â) provides:
Sec. 5.  
Hold Over
. â All incumbent barangay officials and sangguniang kabataan officials shall remain in office unless sooner removed or suspended for cause until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.  The provisions of the Omnibus Election Code relative to failure of elections and special elections are hereby reiterated in this Act.
RA 9164 is now the law that fixes the date of barangay and SK elections, prescribes the term of office of barangay and SK officials, and provides for the qualifications of candidates and voters for the SK elections.
As the law now stands, the language of Section 5 of RA 9164 is clear.  It is the duty of this Court to apply the plain meaning of the language of Section 5.  Since there was a failure of elections in the 15 July 2002 regular elections and in the 13 August 2002 special elections, petitioners can legally remain in office as barangay chairmen of their respective barangays in a hold-over capacity. They shall continue to discharge their powers and duties as 
punong barangay
, and enjoy the rights and privileges pertaining to the office.  True, Section 43(c) of the Local Government Code limits the term of elective barangay officials to three years.  However, Section 5 of RA 9164 explicitly provides that incumbent barangay officials may continue in office in a hold over capacity until their successors are elected and qualified.
Section 5 of RA 9164 reiterates Section 4 of RA 6679 which provides that â[A]ll incumbent barangay officials xxx shall remain in office unless sooner removed or suspended for cause xxx until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.â Section 8 of the same RA 6679 also states that incumbent elective barangay officials running for the same office âshall continue to hold office until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.â
The application of the hold-over principle preserves continuity in the transaction of official business and prevents a hiatus in government pending the assumption of a successor into office.  As held in 
Topacio Nueno v. Angeles
, cases of extreme necessity justify the application of the hold-over principle.
[13]
Clearly therefrom, the COMELEC 
En Banc
 did not commit grave abuse of discretion in ordering those who have been elected and proclaimed in the 
barangay
 elections prior to the 2002 elections to continue as 
Punong Barangays
 in a hold-over capacity until the holding of special 
barangay
 elections.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
, the petition is 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit.
Costs against petitioners.
SO ORDERED.
