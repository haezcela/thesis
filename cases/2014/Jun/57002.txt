[ G.R. No. 194872, June 09, 2014 ]


SAHAR INTERNATIONAL TRADING, INC., PETITIONER, VS. WARNER LAMBERT CO., LLC AND PFIZER, INC. (PHILIPPINES), RESPONDENTS. 
R E S O L U T I O N




PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 are the Decision
[2]
 dated April 22, 2010 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated December 21, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 106455 which annulled and set aside the Orders
[4]
 dated August 5, 2008 and September 25, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 149 (RTC), thereby directing the said court to issue a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining petitioner Sahar International Trading, Inc. (Sahar), its agents, representatives, and assigns, during the pendency of Civil Case No. 08-424, from making, using or offering for sale, or distributing 
Atorvastatin
 or 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 products to various hospitals, drugstores, or to any other individual or entity in the Philippines, or from otherwise infringing the patents of respondent Warner Lambert Co., LLC (Warner Lambert) over the foregoing drugs.
The Facts
Warner Lambert, a foreign corporation, is the registered owner of three (3) Philippine patents, namely: (a) Letters Patent (LP) No. 26330 for the pharmaceutical substance 
Atorvastatin
 valid until April 29, 2009; (b)LP No. 29149 for the pharmaceutical substance 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 valid until September 26, 2012;
[5]
 and (c) LP No. 1-1996-53719 for the pharmaceutical substance 
Atorvastatin
 Calcium in crystalline form valid until October 23, 2019 (subject patents).
[6]
 In general, 
Atorvastatin
 blocks the production of cholesterol in the body and is used to reduce the amounts of LDL (bad cholesterol), total cholesterol, triglycerides (another type of fat), and 
apolipoprotein
 B (a protein needed to make cholesterol) in a personâs blood.
[7]
 
Atorvastatin
 is also used to increase the level of HDL (good cholesterol) in oneâs blood. These actions are important in reducing the risk of hardening of the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular diseases.
[8]
 Warner Lambert and its worldwide affiliates sell products covered by the subject patents under the brand name 
Lipitor.
[9]
On the other hand, respondent Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer)is the exclusive licensee of Warner Lambert to import, market, distribute, and sell products covered by the subject patents in the Philippines. To this end, Pfizer applied for and was issued various Certificates of Product Registration (CPR) from the Bureau of Food and Drugs (now, Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) in order to validly sell and promote such products in the Philippine market.
[10]
Sometime in 2005, Pfizer discovered that Sahar also applied for and was issued a CPR by the FDA for 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 under the brand name 
Atopitar
.
[11]
 It also found out that Sahar has been selling and distributing 
Atopitarin
 the provinces of Bicol, Zamboanga, Cebu, Ilocos Norte, as well as in Tarlac; and that Saharâs marketing ads showed that 
Atopitar is
 neither manufactured by Warner Lambert nor any Pfizer company, but by Geofman
[12]
Pharmaceuticals of Pakistan. Upon further investigation and laboratory testing, Pfizer learned that the 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 that is used in 
Atopitaris
 also in its crystalline form.
[13]
Pfizer immediately sent numerous letters to Sahar informing the latter of Warner Lambertâs patents over 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 and demanding it to cease and desist from selling and distributing said pharmaceutical substance under the brand name 
Atopitar
. However, Sahar did not heed such demands and replied that the patent over 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 had already expired in Pakistan and, therefore, it believed the same can already be freely distributed and marketed in the Philippines by any entity.
[14]
 Thus, Warner Lambert and Pfizer (respondents) filed a Complaint
[15]
for Patent Infringement, Damages, and Injunction, with applications for the issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders and/or Writs of Preliminary Injunction against Sahar before the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 08-424.
[16]
 In support of its prayer for injunctive relief,respondents alleged that Saharâs acts of importing, selling, and offering for sale 
Atorvastatin 
and 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 products under the brand name 
Atopitar
 constitute acts of patent infringement as defined in Section 76
[17]
 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8293,
[18]
 otherwise known as the âIntellectual Property Code of the Philippines,â
[19]
 and that unless Sahar is enjoined from doing said acts, they will suffer irreparable damage and render any judgment ineffectual.
[20]
In opposition to the prayer for injunctive relief, Sahar assailed the validity of Warner Lambertâs patents, maintaining that: (a) the ingredients and the process in the making of the
 Atorvastatin Calcium
 found in 
Atopitar
 is substantially different from that found in Lipitor; (b) the FDAâs issuance of a CPR in its favor should be deemed 
prima facie
 evidence that it is authorized to sell and distribute 
Atopitarin
 the Philippines; and (c) there is no urgent need to enjoin the sale and distribution of 
Atopitarin
 the Philippine market, considering that Warner and Pfizer themselves took more than two (2) years to file their complaint.
[21]
The RTC Ruling
In an Order
[22]
 dated August 5, 2008, the RTC denied respondentsâ application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction against the alleged patent infringement of Sahar. The RTC deemed it proper not to grant such prayer, considering that the instant case is principally for injunction and damages, and, as such, the issuance of an injunctive writ âwould in effect result in [the] premature disposition of the main case and would defeat the purpose of preliminary injunctive relief.â
[23]
Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[24]
 dated August 20, 2008, which was, however, denied by the RTC in an Order
[25]
 dated September 25, 2008. Aggrieved, respondents filed a petition for 
certiorari
[26]
 before the CA.
The CA Ruling
In a Decision
[27]
 dated April 22, 2010, the CA annulled and set aside the assailed orders of the RTC and issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining Sahar, its agents, representatives, and assigns, during the pendency of Civil Case No. 08-424, from making, using or offering for sale, or distributing 
Atopitarin
 the Philippine market.
[28]
The CA held that from the evidence presented, respondents have established their right to preliminary injunctive relief against Saharâs acts of selling and distributing 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 under the brand name 
Atopitar,
 considering that: (a) Warner Lambert is the registered owner of the subject patents which are still existing and effective; (b) Sahar does not deny that it has been selling and distributing products using 
Atorvastatin
 and 
Atorvastatin Calcium
 in crystalline form; and (c) respondentsâ witnesses testified that the presence of 
Atopitar
 is causing confusion among medical practitioners as to the availability of
 Lipitor
 and validity of the subject patents registered under the name of Warner Lambert.
[29]
Further, contrary to the RTCâs findings, the CA held that the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in respondentsâ favor would not result in the prejudgment of the instant case because other issues, such as whether or not Sahar is indeed guilty of patent infringement and thus, liable for damages, still need to be resolved through full-blown trial.
[30]
Dissatisfied, Sahar moved for reconsideration,
[31]
 which was, however, denied by the CA in a Resolution
[32]
 dated December 21, 2010. Hence, this petition.
The Issue Before the Court
The sole issue for the Courtâs resolution is whether or not the CA was correct in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining Sahar, its agents, representatives, and assigns, during the pendency of Civil Case No. 08-424 from making, using or offering for sale, or distributing 
Atopitarin
 the Philippine market.
At this point, it must be noted that on March 11, 2011 and during the pendency of the instant petition, the RTC issued a Judgment
[33]
 dismissing Civil Case No. 08-424 on the ground of lack of cause of action. Thereafter, respondents filed an appeal before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 97495.
[34]
 In a Decision
[35]
 dated November 5, 2013, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC ruling and found Sahar liable for patent infringement, and thus, ordered that: (a) Sahar pay respondents P300,000.00 as temperate or moderate damages, P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as attorneyâs fees and litigation expenses; (b) the writ of preliminary injunction that it issued in its April 22, 2010 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 106455 be made permanent; and (c) Saharâs 
Atopitar,
 wherever they may be found in the Philippines, including materials and implements used in the commission of patent infringement, be condemned, seized, and forfeited.
[36]
The Courtâs Ruling
The petition is dismissed on the ground of mootness.
A case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use. In such instance, there is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. Courts generally decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness. This is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it cannot be enforced.
[37]
Applying the foregoing, the Court finds that the CAâs supervening promulgation of its Decision dated November 5, 2013 in CA-G.R. CV No. 97495 â which reversed the RTCâs Judgment dated March 11, 2011 in Civil Case No. 08-424 and thereby made the writ of preliminary injunction permanent â rendered the present case moot and academic. This is because the primordial issue raised in the instant petition is precisely the propriety of the aforesaid issuance. Since the writ of preliminary injunction is but an incident of the patent infringement case which had already been resolved by the CA, ruling on its propriety would be merely an academic exercise carrying no practical effect. Accordingly, the Court is constrained to dismiss the instant petition. In this relation, it is relevant to point out that it would be premature for the Court to tackle the merits of the CAâs recent decision for the reason that it is not the matter herein appealed.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DISMISSED
 for being moot and academic.

 Section 76 of RA 8293 reads:
Sec. 76. 
Civil Action for Infringement
. â
76.1. The making, using, offering for sale, selling, or importing a patented product or a product obtained directly or indirectly from a patented process, or the use of a patented process without the authorization of the patentee constitutes patent infringement.
76.2. Any patentee, or anyone possessing any right, title or interest in and to the patented invention, whose rights have been infringed, may bring a civil action before a court of competent jurisdiction, to recover from the infringer such damages sustained thereby, plus attorneyâs fees and other expenses of litigation, and to secure an injunction for the protection of his rights.
76.3. If the damages are inadequate or cannot be readily ascertained with reasonable certainty, the court may award by way of damages a sum equivalent to reasonable royalty.
76.4. The court may, according to the circumstances of the case, award damages in a sum above the amount found as actual damages sustained: Provided, That the award does not exceed three (3) times the amount of such actual damages.
76.5. The court may, in its discretion, order that the infringing goods, materials and implements predominantly used in the infringement be disposed of outside the channels of commerce or destroyed, without compensation.
76.6. Anyone who actively induces the infringement of a patent or provides the infringer with a component of a patented product or of a product produced because of a patented process knowing it to be especially adopted for infringing the patented invention and not suitable for substantial non-infringing use shall be liable as a contributory infringer and shall be jointly and severally liable with the infringer.
