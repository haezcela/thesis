PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari
[1]
 are the Decision
[2]
 dated April 30, 2008 and Resolution
[3]
 dated March 27, 2009 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 86558 which affirmed the Decision
[4]
 dated April 29, 2005 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 132 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 95-1812. The CA upheld the RTCâs finding that the liabilities of Paramount Insurance Corporation (Paramount), and respondents Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc. (Phoenix), Mega Pacific Insurance Corporation
[5]
 (Mega Pacific), and Fortune Life and General Insurance Company (Fortune) on their respective counter-surety bonds have been extinguished due to the extension of the principal obligations these bonds covered, to which said respondents did not give their consent.
The Facts
On January 19, 1981, respondents Asia Paces Corporation (ASPAC) and Paces Industrial Corporation (PICO) entered into a sub-contracting agreement, denominated as â200 KV Transmission Lines Contract No. 20-/80-II Civil Works & Electrical Erection,â with the Electrical Projects Company of Libya (ELPCO), as main contractor, for the construction and erection of a double circuit bundle phase conductor transmission line in the country of Libya. To finance its working capital requirements, ASPAC obtained loans from foreign banks Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital (Hong Kong) Limited (PCI Capital) which, upon the latterâs request, were secured by several Letters of Guarantee issued by petitioner Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP),
[6]
 then Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corp., a government owned and controlled corporation created for the primary purpose of, among others, âguarantee[ing], with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board, subject to the rules and regulations that the Monetary Board may prescribe, approved foreign loans, in whole or in part, granted to any entity, enterprise or corporation organized or licensed to engage in business in the Philippines.â
[7]
 Under the Letters of Guarantee, TIDCORP irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed full payment of ASPACâs loan obligations to Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital in the event of default by the latter.
[8]
 The denominations of these letters, including the loan agreements secured by each, are detailed as follows:

Loan Agreement dated October 5, 1982, in the amount of US$2,000,000.00
PCI Capital
As a condition precedent to the issuance by TIDCORP of the Letters of Guarantee, ASPAC, PICO, and ASPACâs President, respondent Nicolas C. Balderrama (Balderrama) had to execute several Deeds of Undertaking,
[10]
 binding themselves to jointly and severally pay TIDCORP for whatever damages or liabilities it may incur under the aforementioned letters. 
In the same light, ASPAC, as principal debtor, entered into surety agreements (Surety Bonds) with Paramount, Phoenix, Mega Pacific and Fortune (bonding companies), as sureties, also holding themselves solidarily liable to TIDCORP, as creditor, for whatever damages or liabilities the latter may incur under the Letters of Guarantee.
[11]

ASPAC eventually defaulted on its loan obligations to Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital, prompting them to demand payment from TIDCORP under the Letters of Guarantee. The demand letter of Banque Indosuez was sent to TIDCORP on March 5, 1984,
[23]
 while that of PCI Capital was sent on February 21, 1985.
[24]
 In turn, TIDCORP demanded payment from Paramount,
[25]
 Phoenix,
[26]
 Mega Pacific,
[27]
 and Fortune
[28]
 under the Surety Bonds. TIDCORPâs demand letters to the bonding companies were sent on May 28, 1985, or before the final expiration dates of all the Surety Bonds, but to no avail.
[29]
Taking into account the moratorium request
[30]
 issued by the Minister of Finance of the Republic of the Philippines (whereby members of the international banking community were requested to grant government financial institutions,
[31]
 such as TIDCORP, among others, a 90-day roll over from their foreign debts beginning October 17, 1983), TIDCORP and its various creditor banks, such as Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital, forged a Restructuring Agreement
[32]
 on April 16, 1986, extending the maturity dates of the Letters of Guarantee.
[33]
 The bonding companies were not privy to the Restructuring Agreement and, hence, did not give their consent to the payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital, among others, in favor of TIDCORP. Nevertheless, following new payment schedules,
[34]
 TIDCORP fully settled its obligations under the Letters of Guarantee to both Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital on December 1, 1992, and April 19 and June 4, 1991, respectively.
[35]
 Seeking payment for the damages and liabilities it had incurred under the Letters of Guarantee and with its previous demands therefor left unheeded, TIIDCORP filed a collection case
[36]
 against: (
a
) ASPAC, PICO, and Balderrama on account of their obligations under the deeds of undertaking; and (
b
) the bonding companies on account of their obligations under the Surety Bonds.
The RTC Ruling
In a Decision
[37]
 dated April 29, 2005, the RTC partially granted TIDCORPâs complaint and thereby found ASPAC, PICO, and Balderrama jointly and severally liable to TIDCORP in the sum of P277,891,359.66 pursuant to the terms of the Deeds of Undertaking, but absolved the bonding companies from liability on the ground that the moratorium request and the consequent payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital in TIDCORPâs favor without their consent extinguished their obligations under the Surety Bonds. As basis, the RTC cited Article 2079 of the Civil Code which provides that an extension granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor/surety extinguishes the guaranty/suretyship, and, in this relation, added that the bonding companies âshould not be held liable as sureties for the extended period.â
[38]
Dissatisfied, TIDCORP and Balderrama filed separate appeals before the CA.
[39]
 For its part, TIDCORP averred, among others, that Article 2079 of the Civil Code is only limited to contracts of guaranty, and, hence, should not apply to contracts of suretyship. Meanwhile, Balderrama theorized that the main contractorâs (
i.e.
, ELPCO) failure to pay ASPAC due to the war/political upheaval in Libya which further resulted in the latterâs inability to pay Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital had the effect of releasing him from his obligations under the Deeds of Undertaking.
The CA Ruling
In a Decision
[40]
 dated April 30, 2008, the CA upheld the RTCâs ruling that the moratorium request âhad the effect of an extension granted to a debtor, which extension was without the consent of the guarantor, and thus released the surety companies from their respective liabilities under the issued surety bondsâ pursuant to Article 2079 of the Civil Code.
[41]
 To this end, it noted that âthe maturity of the foreign loans was extended to December 31, 1989 or up to December 31, 1994 as provided under Section 4.01 of the Restructuring Agreement,â and that âsaid extension is beyond the expiry date[s] of the surety bonds x x x and the maturity date of the principal obligations it purportedly secured, which extension was without [the bonding companiesâ] consent,â
[42]
 It further discredited TIDCORPâs contention that Article 2079 of the Civil Code is only limited to contracts of guaranty by citing the Courtâs pronouncement on the provisionâs applicability to suretyships in the case of 
Security Bank and Trust Co., Inc. v. Cuenca
[43]
 (
Security Bank
). As for Balderrama, the CA debunked his assignment of error, ratiocinating that â[h]is undertaking to pay is not dependent upon the payment to be made by ELPCO to ASPAC.â
[44]
 The CA, however, modified the RTC decision to the extent of holding ASPAC, PICO, and Balderrama liable to TIDCORP for attorneyâs fees in the reasonable amount of P2,000,000.00 since the payment of attorneyâs fees was stipulated by the parties in the Deed of Undertaking dated April 2, 1982.
[45]
Aggrieved, TIDCORP and Balderrama filed separate motions for reconsideration,
[46]
 which were, however, denied in a Resolution
[47]
 dated March 27, 2009. Only TIDCORP elevated the matter to the Court on appeal. Pending resolution thereof, or on October 6, 2010, TIDCORP filed a Motion for Partial Withdrawal
[48]
 of its claim against Paramount in view of their Compromise Agreement
[49]
 dated June 24, 2010 which was approved
[50]
 by the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 92818, entitled â
Trade & Investment Corporation of the Phils., et al. v. Roblet Industrial Construction Corp. and Paramount Insurance Corp., et al
.â
[51]
The Issue Before the Court
The essential issue raised for the Courtâs resolution is whether or not the CA erred in holding that the bonding companiesâ liabilities to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds have been extinguished by the payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital to TIDCORP under the Restructuring Agreement.
The Courtâs Ruling
The petition is granted.
A surety is considered in law as being the same party as the debtor in relation to whatever is adjudged touching the obligation of the latter, and their liabilities are interwoven as to be inseparable. Although the contract of a surety is in essence secondary only to a valid principal obligation, his liability to the creditor is direct, primary and absolute; he becomes liable for the debt and duty of another although he possesses no direct or personal interest over the obligations nor does he receive any benefit therefrom.
[52]
 The fundamental reason therefor is that a contract of suretyship effectively binds the surety as a solidary debtor. This is provided under Article 2047 of the Civil Code which states:
Article 2047. By guaranty a person, called the guarantor, binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the principal debtor in case the latter should fail to do so.
If a person binds himself 
solidarily with the principal debtor
, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this Book shall be observed. 
In such case the contract is called a suretyship
.
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Thus, since the surety is a solidary debtor, it is not necessary that the original debtor first failed to pay before the surety could be made liable; it is enough that a demand for payment is made by the creditor for the suretyâs liability to attach.
[53]
 Article 1216 of the Civil Code provides that:
Article 1216. The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously. The demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to those which may subsequently be directed against the others, so long as the debt has not been fully collected.
Comparing a suretyâs obligations with that of a guarantor, the Court, in the case of 
Palmares v. CA
,
[54]
 illumined that a surety is responsible for the debtâs payment at once if the principal debtor makes default, whereas a guarantor pays only if the principal debtor is unable to pay, 
viz
.:
[55]
A surety is an insurer of the debt, whereas a guarantor is an insurer of the solvency of the debtor.
 A suretyship is an undertaking that the debt shall be paid; a guaranty, an undertaking that the debtor shall pay. Stated differently, a surety promises to pay the principalâs debt if the principal will not pay, while a guarantor agrees that the creditor, after proceeding against the principal, may proceed against the guarantor if the principal is unable to pay. A surety binds himself to perform if the principal does not, without regard to his ability to do so. A guarantor, on the other hand, does not contract that the principal will pay, but simply that he is able to do so. In other words, 
a surety undertakes directly for the payment and is so responsible at once if the principal debtor makes default, while a guarantor contracts to pay if, by the use of due diligence, the debt cannot be made out of the principal debtor
. (Emphases and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)
Despite these distinctions, the Court in 
Cochingyan, Jr. v. R&B Surety & Insurance Co., Inc.
,
[56]
 and later in the case of 
Security Bank
, held that Article 2079 of the Civil Code, which pertinently provides that â
[a]n extension granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guaranty,
â equally applies to both contracts of guaranty and suretyship. The rationale therefor was explained by the Court as follows:
[57]
The theory behind Article 2079 is that 
an extension of time given to the principal debtor by the creditor without the suretyâs consent would deprive the surety of his right to pay the creditor and to be immediately subrogated to the creditorâs remedies against the principal debtor upon the maturity date
. The surety is said to be entitled to protect himself against the contingency of the principal debtor or the indemnitors becoming insolvent during the extended period. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)
Applying these principles, the Court finds that the payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital to TIDCORP under the Restructuring Agreement did not have the effect of extinguishing the bonding companiesâ obligations to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds, notwithstanding the fact that said extensions were made without their consent. This is because Article 2079 of the Civil Code refers to a payment extension granted by the creditor to the principal debtor without the consent of the guarantor or surety. In this case, the Surety Bonds are suretyship contracts which secure the debt of ASPAC, the principal debtor, under the Deeds of Undertaking to pay TIDCORP, the creditor, the damages and liabilities it may incur under the Letters of Guarantee, within the bounds of the bondsâ respective coverage periods and amounts. No payment extension was, however, granted by TIDCORP in favor of ASPAC in this regard; hence, Article 2079 of the Civil Code should not be applied with respect to the bonding companiesâ liabilities to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds.
The payment extensions granted by Banque Indosuez and PCI Capital pertain to TIDCORPâs own debt under the Letters of Guarantee wherein it (TIDCORP) irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed full payment of ASPACâs loan obligations to the banks in the event of its (ASPAC) default. In other words, the Letters of Guarantee secured ASPACâs loan agreements to the banks. Under this arrangement, TIDCORP therefore acted
[58]
 as a guarantor,
[59]
 with ASPAC as the principal debtor, and the banks as creditors.
Proceeding from the foregoing discussion, it is quite clear that there are two sets of transactions that should be treated separately and distinctly from one another following the civil law principle of relativity of contracts âwhich provides that contracts can only bind the parties who entered into it, and it cannot favor or prejudice a third person, even if he is aware of such contract and has acted with knowledge thereof.â
[60]
 Verily, as the Surety Bonds concern ASPACâs debt to TIDCORP and not TIDCORPâs debt to the banks, the payments extensions (which conversely concern TIDCORPâs debt to the
banks and not ASPACâs debt to TIDCORP) would not deprive the bonding companies of their right to pay their creditor (TIDCORP) and to be immediately subrogated to the latterâs remedies against the principal debtor (ASPAC) upon the maturity date. It must be stressed that these payment extensions did not modify the terms of the Letters of Guarantee but only provided for a new payment scheme covering TIDCORPâs liability to the banks. In fine, considering the inoperability of Article 2079 of the Civil Code in this case, the bonding companiesâ liabilities to TIDCORP under the Surety Bonds â except those issued by Paramount and covered by its Compromise Agreement with TIDCORP â have not been extinguished. Since these obligations arose and have been duly demanded within the coverage periods of all the Surety Bonds,
[61]
 TIDCORPâs claim is hereby granted and the CAâs ruling on this score consequently reversed. Nevertheless, given that no appeal has been filed on Balderramaâs adjudged liability or on the award of attorney's fees, the CA's dispositions on these matters are now deemed as final and executory.

[59]
 Quoted hereunder for reference are the pertinent portions of the Courtâs ruling in the case of 
Phil. Export & Foreign Loan Guarantee Corp. v. V.P. Eusebio Construction, Inc.
 (478 Phil. 269, 286-287 [2004]) which involved a similar Letter of Guarantee issued by TIDCORPâs predecessor, the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corp, finding the same to be a contract of guaranty, 
viz
.:
In determining petitionerâs status, it is necessary to read Letter of Guarantee No. 81- 194-F, which provides in part as follows:
In consideration of your issuing the above performance guarantee/counter- guarantee, we hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee, under our Ref. No. LG-81-194 F to pay you on your first written or telex demand Iraq Dinars Two Hundred Seventy One Thousand Eight Hundred Eight and fils six hundred ten (ID271,808/610) representing 100% of the performance bond required of V.P. EUSEBIO for the construction of the Physical Therapy Institute, Phase II, Baghdad, Iraq, plus interest and other incidental expenses related thereto.
In the event of default by V.P. EUSEBIO, we shall pay you 100% of the obligation unpaid
 but in no case shall such amount exceed Iraq Dinars (ID) 271,808/610 plus interest and other incidental expensesâ¦.
Guided by the abovementioned distinctions between a surety and a guaranty, as well as the factual milieu of this case, we find that the Court of Appeals and the trial court were correct in ruling that the petitioner is a guarantor and not a surety. That the guarantee issued by the petitioner is unconditional and irrevocable does not make the petitioner a surety. As a guaranty, it is still characterized by its subsidiary and conditional quality because it does not take effect until the fulfillment of the condition, namely, that the principal obligor should fail in his obligation at the time and in the form he bound himself. In other words, an unconditional guarantee is still subject to the condition that the principal debtor should default in his obligation first before resort to the guarantor could be had. A conditional guaranty, as opposed to an unconditional guaranty, is one which depends upon some extraneous event, beyond the mere default of the principal, and generally upon notice of the principalâs default and reasonable diligence in exhausting proper remedies against the principal.
It appearing that Letter of Guarantee No. 81-194-F merely stated that in the event of default by respondent VPECI the petitioner shall pay, the obligation assumed by the petitioner was simply that of an unconditional guaranty, not conditional guaranty. But as earlier ruled the fact that petitionerâs guaranty is unconditional does not make it a surety. Besides, surety is never presumed. A party should not be considered a surety where the contract itself stipulates that he is acting only as a guarantor. It is only when the guarantor binds himself solidarily with the principal debtor that the contract becomes one of suretyship.

 TIDCORP sent its preliminary demand letters to the bonding companies on May 28, 1985, or before the expiration dates of the Surety Bonds, which â as may be seen from the table above-presented â range from September 28, 1985 at the earliest to June 4, 1986 at the latest.
