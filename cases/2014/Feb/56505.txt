[G.R. No. 184384]
 COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS, SILICON PHILIPPINES, INC., (FORMERLY INTEL PHILIPPINES MANUFACTURING, INC.), RESPONDENT.
DECISION




VILLARAMA, JR., J.:


Before us are three consolidated petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
, as amended, assailing (1) the Decision
[1]
 dated February 18, 2008 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) 
En Banc
 in CTA E.B. No. 219; (2) the Decision
[2]
 dated February 20, 2008 of the CTA 
En Banc
 in CTA E.B. Case No. 209; and (3) the two Resolutions
[3]
 both dated September 2, 2008 of the CTA 
En Banc
 denying the motions for reconsideration from the aforementioned assailed decisions.
The facts as summarized by the CTA in Division and adopted by the CTA 
En Banc
 are as follows:
Silicon Philippines, Inc. (formerly Intel Philippines Manufacturing, Inc.) is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. It is primarily engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and exporting advance and large-scale integrated circuit components.
[4]
 It is registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as a Value-Added Tax (VAT) taxpayer with Certificate of Registration bearing RDO Control No. 94-048-02621.
[5]
 It is likewise registered with the Board of Investments (BOI) as a preferred pioneer enterprise.
[6]
On the other hand, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) is the government official vested with the power and authority to refund any internal revenue tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected under the 
National Internal Revenue Code of 1997
, as amended
[7]
 (hereafter NIRC or Tax Code).
For the 1
st
 quarter of 1999, Silicon seasonably filed its Quarterly VAT Return on April 22, 1999 reflecting, among others, output VAT in the amount of P145,316.96; input VAT on domestic purchases in the amount of P20,041,888.41; input VAT on importation of goods in the amount of P44,560,949.00; and zero-rated export sales in the sum of P929,186,493.91.
[8]
On August 6, 1999, Silicon filed with the CIR, through its One-Stop-Shop Inter-Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center of the Department of Finance (DOF), a claim for tax credit or refund of P64,457,520.45 representing VAT input taxes on its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods and capital equipment which are attributable to zero-rated sales for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999.
Due to the inaction of the CIR, Silicon filed a Petition for Review
[9]
 with the CTA on March 30, 2001, to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period. The petition was docketed as 
CTA Case No. 6263
.
The CIR filed its Answer
[10]
 dated June 1, 2001 raising, among others, the following special and affirmative defenses: (1) that Silicon failed to show compliance with the substantiation requirements under the provisions of Section 16(c)(3)
[11]
 of 
Revenue Regulations No. 5-87
, as amended by 
Revenue Regulations No. 3-88
; and (2) that Silicon has not shown proof that the alleged domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods/capital equipment on which the VAT input taxes were paid are attributable to its export sales or have not yet been applied to the output tax for the period covered in its claim or any succeeding period and that the alleged total foreign exchange proceeds have been accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the 
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
.
During the pendency of the case, Silicon manifested that it was granted by the DOF a tax credit certificate equivalent to 50% of its total claimed input VAT on local purchases of P19,896,571.45 or for the amount of P9,948,285.73. Hence, the CTA Division limited its review on the amounts of P9,896,571.45
[12]
 and P44,560,949.00.
[13]
Meanwhile, on August 10, 2000, Silicon filed a second claim for tax credit or refund in the amount of P20,411,419.07 for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.
To toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period, Silicon filed on June 28, 2002 with the CTA a Petition for Review,
[14]
 which was docketed as 
CTA Case No. 6493
.
The CIR filed an Answer
[15]
 asserting, among others, that Siliconâs claim for refund/tax credit in the amount of P20,411,419.07 was not duly substantiated and that said claim for refund is not subject to zero-percent (0%) rate of VAT under Sections 106(A)(2)(a)(1)
[16]
 and 108(B)(1)
[17]
 of the NIRC. Further, the claim for refund has already prescribed pursuant to Section 112(A) and (B)
[18]
 of the NIRC.
CTA Case Nos. 6263 (Second Division) and 6493 (First Division)
On March 6, 2006, the CTA Second Division rendered a Decision
[19]
 in CTA Case No. 6263 denying Siliconâs claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for the first quarter of 1999 in the amount of P9,896,571.45 representing the input VAT on its alleged domestic purchases of goods and services because it failed to substantiate its claimed zero-rated export sales. The CTA Second Division held that the export sales invoices have no probative value in establishing its zero-rated sales for VAT purposes as the same were not duly registered with the BIR and the required information, particularly the BIR authority to print, was likewise not indicated therein in violation of the provisions of Sections 113,
[20]
 237
[21]
 and 238
[22]
 of the NIRC. The other evidence presented by Silicon, 
i.e.,
 the certification of inward remittance, export declarations, and airway bills were likewise found to be insufficient to prove actual exportation of goods.
With respect to the claim of P44,560,949.00 representing Siliconâs input VAT paid on imported goods, the same was not granted by the CTA Second Division since Silicon did not present duly machine-validated Import Entry and Revenue Declarations or Bureau of Customs official receipts or any other document proving actual payment of VAT on the imported goods as required under Section 4.104-5
[23]
 of 
Revenue Regulations No. 7-95
. Neither did Silicon submit any evidence to prove that the subject imported capital equipment qualify as capital goods pursuant to Section 4.106-1(b)
[24]
 of 
Revenue Regulations No. 7-95
.
Silicon filed a motion for reconsideration from the aforementioned decision but the motion was denied in a Resolution
[25]
 dated June 22, 2006.
Likewise, in a Decision
[26]
 dated June 14, 2006 in CTA Case No. 6493, the CTA First Division denied Siliconâs claim for refund or tax credit of P20,411,419.07 for the second quarter of 2000 on the ground that its reported export sales did not qualify for zero-rating under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1) of the NIRC since the sales invoices were not duly registered VAT sales invoices containing the required information, particularly the BIR authority to print, Siliconâs TIN-VAT number and the imprinted word âzero-rated.â
On October 5, 2006, Siliconâs motion for reconsideration was denied by the CTA First Division.
[27]
Silicon appealed the two decisions of the CTA in Division to the CTA 
En Banc
 as CTA E.B. No. 209 and CTA E.B. No. 219.
Decision of the CTA 
En Banc
 (CTA E.B. Nos. 209 & 219) 
On 
February 18, 2008
, the CTA 
En Banc
 rendered the herein first assailed Decision in CTA E.B. No. 219 partially granting the petition for review and ordering the CIR to refund or issue a tax credit certificate in favor of Silicon Philippines in the reduced amount of P2,139,431.00 representing its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000. After reviewing the records, the CTA 
En Banc
 stated that the amount of P13,916,752.43 may be a valid claim for tax credit or refund which is composed of input VAT on local purchases of P11,777,321.43 and input VAT on importations of P2,139,431.00. However, because Silicon is a BOI-registered entity with 100% exports and sales of properties or services made by VAT-registered suppliers to Silicon are automatically zero-rated, there is no VAT that has to be passed on to Silicon. Consequently, Silicon would not gain input taxes on its purchases of goods, properties or services. Thus, the CTA 
En Banc
 ruled that in the absence of any clear and convincing proof that Siliconâs local suppliers passed on or shifted the VAT on such domestic purchases to Silicon, Silicon cannot claim the amount of P11,777,321.43 as input tax credits on its domestic purchases for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.
On 
February 20, 2008
, the CTA 
En Banc
 also rendered the second assailed Decision in CTA E.B. No. 209 denying the petition for review for lack of merit. After it reviewed and examined the invoices and other documentary evidence of Silicon for the first quarter of 1999, the CTA 
En Banc
 found that Siliconâs valid input VAT for refund was only P9,531,635.69. But since the DOF had already granted Silicon a tax credit certificate on January 24, 2002 in the amount of P9,948,285.73, the CTA 
En Banc
 held that Silicon is no longer entitled to refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for its input tax for the first quarter of 1999.
The Consolidated Petitions before this Court  
In 
G.R. No. 184360
, petitioner Silicon assails the Decision dated February 20, 2008 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2008 of the CTA 
En Banc
 in CTA E.B. Case No. 209.
In its Memorandum, Silicon discussed two important issues. One, whether the CTA 
En Banc
 erred in denying its claim for refund of input VAT derived from domestic purchases of goods and services attributable to its zero-rated sales on the ground of failure to imprint the words âTIN-VATâ and âZERO-RATEDâ on its export sales invoices. And two, whether the CTA 
En Banc
 erred in denying Siliconâs claim for refund on the ground that Silicon failed to prove its input VAT derived from its importation of capital goods and equipment and in not considering the recommendation and findings of the Court-commissioned Independent Certified Public Accountant that Silicon has substantially supported its export sales, importation of capital goods/equipment and its input VAT on local purchases.
In 
G.R. Nos. 184384 & 184361
, Silicon and the CIR assail the Decision dated February 18, 2008 and the Resolution dated September 2, 2008 of the CTA 
En Banc
 in CTA E.B. No. 219 which ordered the CIR to refund, or issue a tax credit certificate to Silicon for the amount of P2,139,431.00 (from the original claim of P20,411,419.07) representing its unutilized excess input VAT on domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods/capital equipment attributable to its zero-rated sales for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.
The issues raised in the three petitions boil down to (1) whether the CTA 
En Banc
 correctly denied Siliconâs claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for its input VAT for its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods/capital equipment attributable to zero-rated sales for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999; and (2) whether the CTA 
En Banc
 correctly ordered the CIR to refund or issue a tax credit certificate in favor of Silicon for the reduced amount of P2,139,431.00 representing Siliconâs unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales for the period April 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000.
Notwithstanding the above issues, we emphasize that when a case is on appeal, this Court has the authority to review matters not specifically raised or assigned as error if their consideration is necessary in reaching a just conclusion of the case.
[28]
In the present case, while the parties never raised as an issue the timeliness of Siliconâs judicial claims, we deem it proper to look into whether the petitions for review filed by Silicon before the CTA were filed within the prescribed period provided under the Tax Code in order to determine whether the CTA validly acquired jurisdiction over the petitions filed by Silicon.
The pertinent provision, Section 112(C) (formerly subparagraph D)
[29]
 of the NIRC reads:
SEC. 112. 
Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax
. â
x x x x
(C) 
Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made
. â In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes 
within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents
 in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.
In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application 
within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period
, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals. (Emphasis supplied.)
The above-mentioned provision expressly grants the CIR 120 days within which to decide the taxpayerâs claim for refund or tax credit. In addition, the taxpayer is granted a 30-day period to appeal to the CTA the decision or inaction of the CIR after the 120-day period.
Meanwhile, the charter of the CTA, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1125, as amended, provides:
Section 7. Jurisdiction. â The CTA shall exercise:
Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:
Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes
, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;
Inaction by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes
, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, 
where the National Internal Revenue Code provides a specific period of action, in which case the inaction shall be deemed a denial
;
x x x x (Emphasis supplied.)
The CTA has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review on appeal decisions of the CIR in cases involving refunds of internal revenue taxes. Moreover, if the CIR fails to decide within the 120-day period provided by law, such inaction shall be deemed a denial of the application for tax refund which the taxpayer can elevate to the CTA through a petition for review.
In the recently decided consolidated cases of 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation
,
[30]
 (San Roque for brevity) this Court stressed the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30 day period provided under Section 112(C) of the NIRC. Therein, we ruled that
x x x The application of the 120+30 day periods was first raised in 
Aichi,
 which adopted the 
verba legis
 rule in holding that the 120+30 day periods are mandatory and jurisdictional. The language of Section 112(C) is plain, clear, and unambiguous. When Section 112(C) states that âthe Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents,â the law clearly gives the Commissioner 120 days within which to decide the taxpayerâs claim. Resort to the courts prior to the expiration of the 120-day period is a patent violation of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, a ground for dismissing the judicial suit due to prematurity. Philippine jurisprudence is awash with cases affirming and reiterating the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Such doctrine is basic and elementary.
When Section 112(C) states that âthe taxpayer affected 
may
, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals,â the law does not make the 120+30 day periods optional just because the law uses the word â
may
.â The word âmayâ simply means that the taxpayer 
may or may not
 
appeal
 the decision of the Commissioner within 30 days from receipt of the decision, or within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period. Certainly, by no stretch of the imagination can the word âmayâ be construed as making the 120+30 day periods optional, allowing the taxpayer to file a judicial claim one day after filing the administrative claim with the Commissioner.
The old rule that the taxpayer may file the judicial claim, without waiting for the Commissionerâs decision if the two-year prescriptive period is about to expire, cannot apply because that rule was adopted before the enactment of the 30-day period. 
The 30-day period was adopted precisely to do away with the old rule, so that under the VAT System the taxpayer will always have 30 days to file the judicial claim even if the Commissioner acts only on the 120
th
 day, or does not act at all during the 120-day period.
 With the 30-day period always available to the taxpayer, the taxpayer can no longer file a judicial claim for refund or credit of input VAT without waiting for the Commissioner to decide until the expiration of the 120-day period.
To repeat, a claim for tax refund or credit, like a claim for tax exemption, is construed strictly against the taxpayer. One of the conditions for a judicial claim of refund or credit under the VAT System is compliance with the 120+30 day mandatory and jurisdictional periods. Thus, strict compliance with the 120+30 day periods is necessary for such a claim to prosper, whether before, during, or after the effectivity of the 
Atlas
 doctrine, except for the period from the issuance of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 on 10 December 2003 to 6 October 2010 when the 
Aichi
 doctrine was adopted, which again reinstated the 120+30 day periods as mandatory and jurisdictional.
[31]
In the case of 
Philex Mining Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
, which was consolidated with the case of San Roque, this Court denied Philexâs claim for refund since its petition for review was filed with the CTA beyond the 120+30 day period. The Court explained:
Unlike San Roque and Taganito, Philexâs case is not one of premature filing but of late filing. Philex did not file any petition with the CTA within the 120-day period. Philex did not also file any petition with the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Philex filed its judicial claim 
long after
 the expiration of the 120-day period, in fact 426 days after the lapse of the 120-day period. 
In any event, whether governed by jurisprudence before, during, or after the 
Atlas
 case, Philexâs judicial claim will have to be rejected because of late filing.
 Whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment of the output VAT following the 
Atlas 
doctrine, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales attributable to the input VAT were made following the 
Mirant
 and 
Aichi
 doctrines, Philexâs judicial claim was indisputably filed late.
The 
Atlas
 doctrine cannot save Philex from the late filing of its judicial claim. The 
inaction 
of the Commissioner on Philexâs claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, âdeemed a denialâ of Philexâs claim. Philex had 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Philexâs failure to do so rendered the âdeemed a denialâ decision of the Commissioner final and inappealable. The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or âdeemed a denialâ decision of the Commissioner is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise. Philex failed to comply with the statutory conditions and must thus bear the consequences.
[32]
Also, in the recent case of 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Dash Engineering Philippines, Inc.
,
[33]
 this Court likewise denied the claim for tax refund for having been filed late or after the expiration of the 30-day period from the denial by the CIR or failure of the CIR to make a decision within 120 days from the submission of the documents in support of its administrative claim. We held:
Petitioner is entirely correct in its assertion that compliance with the periods provided for in the abovequoted provision is indeed mandatory and jurisdictional, as affirmed in this Courtâs ruling in 
San Roque
, where the Court 
En Banc
 settled the controversy surrounding the application of the 120+30-day period provided for in Section 112 of the NIRC and reiterated the 
Aichi
 doctrine that the 120+30-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional. Nonetheless, the Court took into account the issuance by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (
BIR
) of BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 which misled taxpayers by explicitly stating that taxpayers may file a petition for review with the CTA even before the expiration of the 120-day period given to the CIR to decide the administrative claim for refund. Even though observance of the periods in Section 112 is compulsory and failure to do so will deprive the CTA of jurisdiction to hear the case, such a strict application will be made from the effectivity of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 on January 1, 1998 until the present, except for the period from December 10, 2003 (the issuance of the erroneous BIR ruling) to October 6, 2010 (the promulgation of 
Aichi
), during which taxpayers need not wait for the lapse of the 120+30-day period before filing their judicial claim for refund.
[34]
After a careful perusal of the records in the instant case, we find that Siliconâs judicial claims were filed late and way beyond the prescriptive period. Siliconâs claims do not fall under the exception mentioned above. Silicon filed its Quarterly VAT Return for the 1
st
 quarter of 1999 on April 22, 1999 and subsequently filed on August 6, 1999 a claim for tax credit or refund of its input VAT taxes for the same period. From August 6, 1999, the CIR had until December 4, 1999, the last day of the 120-day period, to decide Siliconâs claim for tax refund. But since the CIR did not act on Siliconâs claim on or before the said date, Silicon had until January 3, 2000, the last day of the 30-day period to file its judicial claim. However, Silicon failed to file an appeal within 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period, and it only filed its petition for review with the CTA on March 30, 2001 which was 
451 days late
. Thus, in consonance with our ruling in 
Philex
 in the 
San Roque ponencia
, Siliconâs judicial claim for tax credit or refund should have been dismissed for having been filed late. The CTA did not acquire jurisdiction over the petition for review filed by Silicon.
Similarly, Siliconâs claim for tax refund for the second quarter of 2000 should have been dismissed for having been filed out of time. Records show that Silicon filed its claim for tax credit or refund on August 10, 2000. The CIR then had 120 days or until December 8, 2000 to grant or deny the claim. With the inaction of the CIR to decide on the claim which was deemed a denial of the claim for tax credit or refund, Silicon had until January 7, 2001 or 30 days from December 8, 2000 to file its petition for review with the CTA. However, Silicon again failed to comply with the 120+30 day period provided under Section 112(C) since it filed its judicial claim only on June 28, 2002 or 
536 days late
. Thus, the petition for review, which was belatedly filed, should have been dismissed by the CTA which acquired no jurisdiction to act on the petition.
Courts are bound by prior decisions. Thus, once a case has been decided one way, courts have no choice but to resolve subsequent cases involving the same issue in the same manner.
[35]
As this Court has repeatedly emphasized, a tax credit or refund, like tax exemption, is strictly construed against the taxpayer.
[36]
 The taxpayer claiming the tax credit or refund has the burden of proving that he is entitled to the refund by showing that he has strictly complied with the conditions for the grant of the tax refund or credit. Strict compliance with the mandatory and jurisdictional conditions prescribed by law to claim such tax refund or credit is essential and necessary for such claim to prosper.
[37]
 Noncompliance with the mandatory periods, nonobservance of the prescriptive periods, and nonadherence to exhaustion of administrative remedies bar a taxpayerâs claim for tax refund or credit, whether or not the CIR questions the numerical correctness of the claim of the taxpayer.
[38]
 For failure of Silicon to comply with the provisions of Section 112(C) of the NIRC, its judicial claims for tax refund or credit should have been dismissed by the CTA for lack of jurisdiction.
Considering the foregoing disquisition, we deem it unnecessary to rule upon the other issues raised by the parties in the three consolidated petitions.
