R E S O L U T I O N




BRION, J.:


We resolve in this Resolution all the pending incidents in this case, specifically:
(a)
 
The determination of the relevance and advisability of the public disclosure of the documents submitted by respondents President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Lt. Gen. Romeo P. Tolentino, Maj. Gen. Juanito Gomez, Maj. Gen. Delfin Bangit, Lt. Col. Noel Clement, Lt. Col. Melquiades Feliciano, Director General Oscar Calderon, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Gen. Hermogenes Esperon, Jr.; Commanding General of the Philippine Army, Lt. Gen. Alexander Yano; and Chief of the Philippine National Police, Director General Avelino Razon, Jr. to this Court per paragraph III (i) of the 
fallo
 of our July 5, 2011 Resolution; and
(b) 
The Urgent 
Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
[1]
 (together with sealed attachments) filed by petitioner Edita T. Burgos praying that the Court: (1) order the persons named in the sealed documents impleaded in CA-G.R. SP No. 00008-WA and G.R. No. 183713; (2) issue a writ of 
Amparo
 on the basis of the newly discovered evidence (the sealed attachments to the motion); and (3) refer the cases to the Court of Appeals (
CA
) for further hearings on the newly discovered evidence.
FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS
A. The Courtâs June 22, 2010 Resolution
These incidents stemmed from our June 22, 2010 Resolution referring the present case to the Commission on Human Rights (
CHR
) as the Courtâs directly commissioned agency, tasked with the continuation of the investigation of Jonas Joseph T. Burgosâ abduction with the obligation to report its factual findings and recommendations to this Court. This referral was necessary as the investigation by the Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (
PNP-CIDG
), by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (
AFP
) Provost Marshal, and even the initial CHR investigation had been less than complete. In all of them, there were significant lapses in the handling of the investigation. In particular, we 
highlighted the PNP-CIDGâs failure to identify the cartographic sketches of two (one male and one female) of the five abductors of Jonas, based on their interview with the eyewitnesses to the abduction
.
In this same Resolution, we also affirmed the CAâs dismissal of the petitions for Contempt and issuance of a Writ of 
Amparo
 with respect to President Macapagal-Arroyo who was then entitled, as President, to immunity from suit.
The March 15, 2011 CHR Report 
On March 15, 2011, the CHR submitted to the Court its 
Investigation Report on the Enforced Disappearance of Jonas Burgos
 (
CHR Report
), in compliance with our June 22, 2010 Resolution. On the basis of the gathered evidence, the CHR submitted the following findings:
Based on the facts developed by evidence obtaining in this case, 
the CHR finds that the enforced disappearance of Jonas Joseph T. Burgos had transpired; and that his constitutional rights to life liberty and security were violated by the Government have been fully determined
.
Jeffrey Cabintoy and Elsa Agasang have witnessed on that fateful day of April 28, 2007 the forcible abduction of Jonas Burgos by a group of about seven (7) men and a woman
 from the extension portion of Hapag Kainan Restaurant, located at the ground floor of Ever Gotesco Mall, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City.
x x x x
The eyewitnesses mentioned above were 
Jeffrey Cabintoy
 (
Jeffrey
) and Elsa Agasang (Elsa), who at the time of the abduction were working as 
busboy
 and Trainee-Supervisor, respectively, at Hapag Kainan Restaurant.
In his Sinumpaang Salaysay, Jeffrey had a clear recollection of the face of HARRY AGAGEN BALIAGA, JR. as one of the principal abductors
, apart from the faces of the two abductors in the cartographic sketches that he described to the police, after he was shown by the 
Team
 the pictures in the PMA Year Book of Batch Sanghaya 2000 and group pictures of men taken some years thereafter.
The same group of pictures were shown to detained former 56
th
 IB Army trooper Edmond M. Dag-uman (Dag-uman), who also positively identified Lt. Harry Baliaga, Jr. Dagumanâs 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
 states that he came to know Lt. Baliaga as a Company Commander in the 56
th
 IB while he was still in the military service (with Serial No. 800693, from 1997 to 2002) also with the 56
th
 IB but under 1Lt. Usmalik Tayaban, the Commander of Bravo Company.
 When he was arrested and brought to the 56
th
 IB Camp in April 2005, he did not see Lt. Baliaga anymore at the said camp. The similar reaction that the pictures elicited from both Jeffrey and Daguman did not pass unnoticed by the 
Team
. Both men always look pensive, probably because of the pathetic plight they are in right now. It came as a surprise therefore to the 
Team
 when they could hardly hide their smile upon seeing the face of Baliaga, as if they know the man very well.
Moreover, when the 
Team
 asked how certain Jeffrey was or [sic] that it was indeed Baliaga that he saw as among those who actually participated in Jonasâ abduction. Jeffrey was able to give a graphic description and spontaneously, to boot, the blow by blow account of the incident, including the initial positioning of the actors, specially Baliaga, who even approached, talked to, and prevented him from interfering in their criminal act.
A Rebel-returnee (RR) named Maria Vita Lozada y Villegas @KA MY, has identified the face of the female in the cartographic sketch as a certain Lt. Fernando. While Lozada refuses to include her identification of Lt. Fernando in her 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
 for fear of a backlash, she told the Team that she was certain it was Lt. Fernando in the cartographic sketch since both of them were involved in counter-insurgency operations at the 56
th
 IB, while she was under the care of the battalion from March 2006 until she left the 56
th
 IB Headquarters in October 2007. Lozadaâs involvement in counter-insurgency operations together with Lt. Fernando was among the facts gathered by the CHR Regional Office 3 Investigators, whose investigation into the enforced disappearance of Jonas Joseph Burgos was documented by way of an After Mission Report dated August 13, 2008.
Most if not all the actual abductors would have been identified had it not been for what is otherwise called as 
evidentiary difficulties
 shamelessly put up by some police and military elites. 
The deliberate refusal of TJAG Roa to provide the CHR with the requested documents does not only defy the Supreme Court directive to the AFP but 
ipso facto
 created a disputable presumption that AFP personnel were responsible for the abduction and that their superiors would be found accountable, if not responsible, for the crime committed.
 This observation finds support in the disputable presumption â
That evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced
.â (Paragraph (e), Section 3, Rule 131 on Burden of Proof and Presumptions, Revised Rules on Evidence of the Rules of Court of the Philippines).
In saying that the requested document is irrelevant, the 
Team
 has deemed that the requested documents and profiles would help ascertain the true identities of the cartographic sketches of two abductors because a certain Virgilio Eustaquio has claimed that one of the intelligence operatives involved in the 2007 ERAP 5 case fits the description of his abductor.
As regards the PNP CIDG, the positive identification of former 56
th
 IB officer Lt. HARRY A. BALIAGA, JR. as one of the principal abductors has effectively crushed the theory of the CIDG witnesses that the NPAs abducted Jonas.
 Baliagaâs true identity and affiliation with the military have been established by overwhelming evidence corroborated by detained former Army trooper Dag-uman.
For lack of material time, the Commission will continue to investigate the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos as an independent body and pursuant to its mandate under the 1987 Constitution. Of particular importance are the identities and locations of the persons appearing in the cartographic sketches; the allegations that CIDG Witnesses Emerito G. Lipio and Meliza Concepcion-Reyes are AFP enlisted personnel and the alleged participation of Delfin De Guzman @ Ka Baste in the abduction of Jonas Burgos whose case for Murder and Attempted Murder was dismissed by the court for failure of the lone witness, an army man of the 56
th
 IB to testify against him.
Interview with Virgilio Eustaquio, Chairman of the Union Masses for Democracy and Justice (UMDJ), 
revealed that the male abductor of Jonas Burgos appearing in the cartographic sketch was among the raiders who abducted him and four others, identified as Jim Cabauatan, Jose Curament, Ruben Dionisio and Dennis Ibona otherwise known as ERAP FIVE
.
Unfortunately, and as already pointed out above, The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) turned down the request of the Team for a profile of the operatives in the so-called â
Erap 5
â abduction on the ground of relevancy and branded the request as a fishing expedition per its Disposition Form dated September 21, 2010.
Efforts to contact Virgilio Eustaquio to secure his affidavit proved futile, as his present whereabouts cannot be determined. And due to lack of material time, the Commission decided to pursue the same and determine the whereabouts of the other members of the â
Erap 5
â on its own time and authority as an independent body.

B. The Courtâs July 5, 2011 Resolution

 to our later determination of the relevance and of the advisability of public disclosure of those documents/materials;
[6]
E. The Courtâs October 11, 2011 Resolution 
On October 11, 2011, we issued a Resolution requiring the CHR to secure Virgilio Eustaquioâs affidavit, and to submit a report of its ongoing investigation of Jonasâ abduction, 
viz
:
(1)
 
REQUIRE
 the Commission on Human Rights to undertake all available measures to obtain the affidavit of witness Virgilio Eustaquio in connection with his allegation that one of the male abductors of Jonas Joseph T. Burgos, appearing in the cartographic sketch, was among the âraidersâ who abducted him and four others, identified as Jim Cabauatan, Jose Curament, Ruben Dionisio and Dennis Ibona (otherwise known as the âERAP FIVEâ);
(2) 
DIRECT
 the Commission on Human Rights to submit to this Court, within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution, a Report, with its recommendations of its ongoing investigation of Burgosâ abduction, and the affidavit of Virgilio Eustaquio, if any, copy furnished the petitioner, the Court of Appeals, the incumbent Chiefs of the AFP, the PNP and the PNP-CIDG, and all the present respondents before the Court of Appeals.
[7]
F. The Courtâs November 29, 2011 Resolution

th
 IB, 7

SOI of the intelligence operatives who were involved in the ERAP 5 incident; and
SOI of 2Lt. Fernando who was a member of the 56
th
 IB, 7
th
 ID.
[8]
In our November 29, 2011 Resolution, we denied the CHR's request considering the confidential nature of the requested documents and because the relevance of these documents to the present case had not been established. We referred the CHR to our July 5, 2011 Resolution where we pointedly stated that these documents shall be âreleased exclusively to this Court for our examination to determine their relevance to the present case and the advisability of their public disclosure.â
[9]
We held that â[w]e see no reason at this time to release these confidential documents since their relevance to the present case has not been established to our satisfaction. It is precisely for this reason that we issued our October 24, 2011 Resolution and directed the CHR to submit to this Court, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the Resolution, a Report with its recommendations of its ongoing investigation of Jonas Burgosâ abduction, and the affidavit of Virgilio Eustaquio, if any. Simply stated, it is only after the CHR's faithful compliance with our October 24, 2011 Resolution that we will be able to determine the relevance of the requested documents to the present case.â
[10]
G. The March 20, 2012 CHR Progress Report and Eustaquioâs Affidavit 
On March 20, 2012, the CHR submitted its Progress Report detailing its efforts to secure the affidavit of witness Eustaquio in relation with his allegation that one of the male abductors of Jonas, appearing in the cartographic sketch, was among the raiders who abducted him and four others, identified as Jim Cabauatan, Jose Curament, Ruben Dionisio and Dennis Ibona (otherwise known as the âERAP FIVEâ). Attached to this Report is Eustaquioâs sworn affidavit dated March 16, 2012, which pertinently stated:
I was one of the victims in the abduction incident on May 22, 2006 otherwise known as ERAP 5 and because of that, we filed a case with the Ombudsman against Commodore Leonardo Calderon, et al., all then ISAFP elements, docketed as OMB-P-C-06-04050-E for Arbitrary Detention, Unlawful Arrest, Maltreatment of Prisoners, Grave Threats, Incriminatory Machination, and Robbery.
On March 16, 2012, I was approached again by the CHR Special Investigation Team regarding the information I have previously relayed to them sometime in September 2010 as to the resemblance of the cartographic sketch of the man as described by the two eyewitnesses Elsa Agasang and Jeffrey Cabintoy in the abduction case of Jonas Burgos;
I can say that the male abductor of Jonas Burgos appearing in the cartographic sketch is among the raiders who abducted me and my four other companions because the cartographic sketch almost exactly matched and/or resembled to the cartographic sketch that I also provided and described in relation to the said incident at my rented house in Kamuning, Quezon City on May 22, 2006.
I am executing this affidavit voluntarily, freely and attest to the truth of the foregoing.
[11]
H. The March 18, 2013 CA Decision 
On March 18, 2013, the CA issued its decision pursuant to the Courtâs July 5, 2011 Resolution referring the 
Amparo
 and 
Habeas Corpus
 aspects of the case to the CA for appropriate hearings and ruling on the merits of the petitions.
Petition for Habeas Corpus 
The CA held that the issue in the petition for 
habeas corpus
 is not the illegal confinement or detention of Jonas, but his enforced disappearance. Considering that Jonas was a victim of enforced disappearance, the present case is beyond the ambit of a petition for 
habeas corpus
.
Petition for the Writ of Amparo     
Based on its finding that Jonas was a victim of enforced disappearance, the CA concluded that the present case falls within the ambit of the Writ of 
Amparo
. The CA found that the totality of the evidence supports the petitionerâs allegation that the military was involved in the enforced disappearance of Jonas. The CA took note of Jeffrey Cabintoyâs positive identification of Lt. Baliaga as one of the abductors who approached him and told him not to interfere because the man being arrested had been under surveillance for drugs; he also remembered the face of Lt. Baliaga â the face he identified in the pictures because he resembles his friend Raven. The CA also held that Lt. Baliagaâs alibi and corroborative evidence cannot prevail over Cabintoyâs positive identification, considering especially the absence of any indication that he was impelled by hatred or any improper motive to testify against Lt. Baliaga. Thus, the CA held that Lt. Baliaga was responsible and the AFP and the PNP were accountable for the enforced disappearance of Jonas.
Based on these considerations, the CA resolved to:
1)
RECOGNIZING
 the abduction of Jonas Burgos as an enforced disappearance covered by the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
;
2)
 With regard to authorship,
a)
 
DECLARING
 Maj. Harry A. Baliaga, Jr. 
RESPONSIBLE
 for the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos; and
b) 
DECLARING
 the Armed Forces of the Philippines and elements of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, particularly the Philippine Army, 
ACCOUNTABLE
 for the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos;
3)
 
DECLARING
 the Philippine National Police 
ACCOUNTABLE
 for the conduct of an exhaustive investigation of the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos. To this end, the PNP through its investigative arm, the PNP-CIDG, is directed to exercise extraordinary diligence to identify and locate the abductors of Jonas Burgos who are still at large and to establish the link between the abductors of Jonas Burgos and those involved in the ERAP 5 incident.
(4)
 
DIRECTING
 the incumbent Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Director General of the Philippine National Police, and their successors, to ensure the continuance of their investigation and coordination on the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos until the persons found responsible are brought before the bar of justice;
(5) 
DIRECTING
 the Commission on Human Rights to continue with its own independent investigation on the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos with the same degree of diligence required under the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
; and
(6) 
DIRECTING
 the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to extend full assistance to the Commission on Human Rights in the conduct of the latterâs investigation.
The Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Director General, Philippine National Police and the Chairman, Commission on Human Rights are hereby 
DIRECTED
 to submit a quarterly report to this Court on the results of their respective investigation.
The filing of petitionerâs 
Affidavit-Complaint
 against Maj. Harry A. Baliaga, Jr., et al. before the Department of Justice on June 9, 2011 is 
NOTED
. Petitioner is 
DIRECTED
 to immediately inform this Court of any development regarding the outcome of the case.
[12]
The Respondentâs April 3, 2013 Motion for Partial Reconsideration
The Solicitor General, in behalf of the public respondents (the AFP Chief of Staff and the PNP Director General), filed a motion for partial reconsideration of the March 18, 2013 CA decision. The motion made the following submissions:
5. x x x[T]he Director General, PNP, respectfully takes exception to the Honorable Courtâs findings that the PNP, specifically the CIDG, âfailed to exercise extraordinary diligence in the conduct of its investigation.â x x x [T]hat this Honorable Court arrived at a conclusion different from that of the CIDG, or accorded different credence to the statements of the witnesses presented by the parties, does not necessarily translate to the CIDGâs failure to exercise extraordinary diligence.
6. The Chief of Staff, AFP also takes exception to the Honorable Courtâs findings that the âChief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Commanding General should be held accountable for Jonas Burgos disappearance for failing to exercise extraordinary diligence in conducting an internal investigation on the matter. The unwillingness of the respondent officers of the 56
th
 IB to cooperate in the investigation conducted by the CHR is a persuasive proof of the alleged cover up of the militaryâs involvement in the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos.â
The AFP and the Philippine Army conducted a thorough investigation to determine the veracity of the allegations implicating some of its officers and personnel. After the conduct of the same, it is the conclusion of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Army, based on the evidence they obtained, that Jonas Burgos has never been in custody.
7. The Chief of Staff, AFP, also respectfully takes exception to the finding of the Honorable Court ârecognizing the abduction of Jonas Burgos as an enforced disappearance.â
x x x x
That the Honorable Court found a member of the Philippine Army or even a group of military men to be responsible for the abduction of Jonas Burgos, does not necessarily make the same a case of âenforced disappearanceâ involving the State. There is dearth of evidence to show that the government is involved. Respondent Baliagaâs alleged participation in the abduction and his previous membership in the 56
th
 Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army, by themselves, do not prove the participation or acquiescence of the State.

I. The CA Resolution dated May 23, 2013     
On May 23, 2013, the CA issued its resolution denying the respondentsâ motion for partial reconsideration. The CA ruled that as far as the PNP was concerned, its failure to elicit leads and information from Cabintoy who witnessed Jonasâ abduction is eloquent proof of its failure to exercise extraordinary diligence in the conduct of its investigation. As far as the AFP was concerned, the CA held that the fact that Lt. Baliaga of the Philippine Army was positively identified as one of the abductors of Jonas, coupled with the AFPâs lack of serious effort to conduct further investigation, spoke loudly of the AFP leadershipâs accountability.
To date, the respondents have not appealed to this Court, as provided under Section 19 of the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
.

J. The Petitionerâs Urgent Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela dated April 1, 2013 
On April 1, 2013, the petitioner filed an 
Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
 asking the Court to: (1) order the persons named in the sealed documents to be impleaded in CA-G.R. SP No. 00008-WA and G.R. No. 183713; (2) issue a writ of 
Amparo
 on the basis of the newly discovered evidence (the sealed attachment to the motion); and (3) refer the cases to the CA for further hearing on the newly discovered evidence.
The petitioner alleged that she received from a source (who requested to remain anonymous) documentary evidence proving that an intelligence unit of the 7
th
 Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and 56
th
 Infantry Battalion, operating together, captured Jonas on April 28, 2007 at Ever Gotesco Mall, Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City. This documentary evidence consists of: (1) After Apprehension Report dated April 30, 2007; (2) Psycho Social Processing Report dated April 28, 2007; and (3) Autobiography of Jonas. The petitioner also claimed that these are copies of confidential official reports on file with the Philippine Army.
i. After Apprehension Report dated April 30, 2007 
This report is a photocopy consisting six pages dated April 30, 2007, addressed to the Commanding Officer, 7MIB, 7ID, LA, Fort Magsaysay, NE. The report detailed the planning and the objective of apprehending target communist leaders, among them, one alias âRamonâ who was captured at Ever Gotesco Mall, Commonwealth, Quezon City on April 28, 2007 by joint elements of the 72 MICO and S2, 56
th
 IB. This report also listed the names of the military personnel belonging to task organization 72 MICO and 56
th
 IB who conducted the operation.
ii. Psycho Social Processing Report dated April 28, 2007 
This report details Jonasâ abduction and âneutralizationâ; the results of his interrogation and the intelligence gathered on his significant involvements/activities within the CPP/NPA/NDF organization.
iii. Undated Autobiography 
This autobiography narrates how Jonas started as a student activist, his recruitment and eventual ascent in the CPP/NPA as an intelligence officer.
K. The Courtâs April 11, 2013 Resolution 
In our April 11, 2013 Resolution, the Court resolved to require the respondents to Comment on the petitionerâs Urgent 
Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
 and its attachments, within ten (10) days from receipt of the Resolution. In the same Resolution, the Court:
(1)
 required BGen. Roa and Lt. Gen. Emmanuel T. Bautista to fully comply with the terms of Section III (i) of the dispositive portion of our July 5, 2011 Resolution within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the resolution;
(2)
 required Lt. Gen. Emmanuel T. Bautista to submit a written assurance within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Resolution that the military personnel listed in the submitted 
After Apprehension Report
 can be located and be served with the processes that the Court may serve;
(3)
 issued a Temporary Protection Order in favor of the petitioner and all the members of her immediate family;
(4) 
directed the DOJ and the NBI to provide security and protection to the petitioner and her immediate family and to submit a confidential memorandum on the security arrangements made;
(5)
 
directed the NBI to coordinate and provide direct investigative assistance to the CHR as it may require pursuant to the authority granted under the Courtâs June 22, 2010 Resolution.
[15]
i. The respondentsâ Comment from the petitionerâs 
Urgent Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
 dated June 6, 2013 
On June 6, 2013, the respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed their comments on the petitionerâs 
Urgent Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
.
First
, the respondents alleged that the documents submitted by the petitioner do not exist in the concerned military unitsâ respective records, nor are they in the custody or possession of their respective units. To support their allegations, the respondents submitted the following:
Certification dated May 29, 2013 from Maj. Gen. Gregorio Pio P. Catapang, Jr. Commander, 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army stating that the documents
[16]
 submitted by the petitioner âdo not exist nor in the possession/custody of this Headquarters.â
Certification dated May 29, 2013, from Lt. Col. Louie D.S. Villanueva, Assistant Chief of Staff, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel, G1, 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army stating that the documents submitted by the petitioner âcould not be found nor do they exist in the records of this Command.â
Certification dated May 24, 2013 from Lt. Col. Bernardo M. Ona, Commanding Officer, 56
th
 Infantry Battalion, 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army stating that the documents submitted by the petitioner âdo not exist at this unit.â
Certification dated May 24, 2013 from 1Lt. Donal S. Frias, Acting Commanding Officer, 72
nd
 Military Intelligence Company, 7
th
 Military Intelligence Battalion, 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army stating that the documents submitted by the petitioner âdo not exist at the records or in the possession of this unit.â
[17]
The respondents also submitted the affidavits of Lt. Col. Melquiades Feliciano, Maj. Allan M. Margarata and Cpl. Ruby Benedicto, 
viz
:
a. In his June 3, 2013 Affidavit, Col. Feliciano stated:
That I was assigned as Battalion Commander of 56
th
 Infantry Division, 7
th
 Infantry Division, PA last 17 January 2007 to 17 August 2007.
That I was showed a photocopy of the After Apprehension Report dated 30 April 2007 wherein members of 56
th
 IB, 7ID, PA were included therein.
I vehemently oppose to (sic) the existence of the said document and the participation of my men listed thereat. There were no military operations that I have authorized or approved regarding Jonas Burgos. The contents thereof are false and utter fabrication of facts.
b. In his May 31, 2013 Affidavit, Maj. Margarata stated:
That I was assigned at 72
nd
 Military Intelligence Company (72MICO), 7
th
 Infantry Division, PA from 01 July 2006 to 01 July 2008.
That I was showed a photocopy of the Psycho-Social Processing Report dated 28 April 2007 and After Apprehension Report dated 30 April 2007, both of which purportedly came from 72MICO, 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army and that on the last page of the Pyscho-Social Processing Report appears my name therein.
I vehemently oppose to (sic) the existence of the said documents and the implication of my name in the said documents. The contents thereof are purely a product of wild imagination. I have never seen such document until now.
I can only surmise that these are plainly a fishing expedition on the part of Mrs. Edita Burgos. A ploy to implicate any military personnel especially those belonging to the 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army.
c. In her May 31, 2013 Affidavit, Cpl. Benedicto stated:
That I was never assigned at 72
nd
 Military Intelligence Company, 7
th
 Infantry Division, PA.
That I was showed a photocopy of the Psycho-Social Processing Report dated 28 April 2007 and After Apprehension Report dated 30 April 2007, both of which purportedly came from 72MICO, 7
th
 Infantry Division, Philippine Army and that on the last page of the Psycho-Social Processing Report appears my name therein.
I vehemently oppose to (sic) the existence of the said documents and the implication of my name in the said documents. The contents thereof are false and utter fabrication of facts. How can I ever be at 72MICO if I was never assigned thereat.
I have never been an interrogator in my entire military service. I have never been a member of any operation which involves the name of Jonas Burgos or any other military operation for that matter. I have never seen such document until now.
Furthermore, I have never worked with Maj. Allan Margarata or of his unit, 72MICO.
[18]
Second
, the respondents note that none of the documents submitted by the petitioner were signed; a writ of 
Amparo
 cannot be issued and the investigation cannot progress on the basis of false documents and false information.
Lastly
, the respondents argue that since the National Bureau of Investigation (
NBI
) and CHR are conducting their own investigations of the case, the petitionerâs motion at this point is premature; the proceedings to be conducted by the CA will be at the very least redundant.
ii. The Respondentsâ Compliance dated June 7, 2013 
On June 7, 2013, the respondents, through the Office of Judge Advocate General, complied with our April 11, 2013 Resolution by submitting the following documents:

[19]
OUR RULING
A. On the relevancy and disclosure of the documents submitted to this Court per paragraph III(i) of the fallo of our July 5, 2011 Resolution  
The directive for the submission of the above-mentioned documents arose from our determination in our June 22, 2010 Resolution that the PNP-CIDG failed to identify the cartographic sketches of two (one male and one female) of the five abductors of Jonas, based on their interview with eyewitnesses to the abduction. For this reason, the Court directly commissioned the CHR to continue the investigation of Jonasâ abduction and the gathering of evidence.
Based on its March 15, 2011 Report, the CHR uncovered a lead â a claim made by Eustaquio, Chairman of the Union Masses for Democracy and Justice, that the male abductor of Jonas appearing in the cartographic sketch was among the raiders who abducted him and four others, known as the âERAP FIVE.â
This prompted the CHR to request copies of the documents embodied in par. III(i) of the 
fallo
 of the Courtâs July 5, 2011 Resolution from General Gilberto Jose C. Roa of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, AFP. Gen. Roa initially denied this request but eventually complied with the Courtâs directive of July 5, 2011 to submit the documents 
via
 the September 23, 2011 Manifestation and Motion and the June 7, 2013 Compliance. In the same July 5, 2011 Resolution, the Court made it plain that these documents shall be released exclusively to the Court for its examination to determine their relevance to the present case and the advisability of their public disclosure.
Pursuant to the Courtâs October 11, 2011 Resolution, the CHR submitted its March 20, 2012 Progress Report on its continuing investigation of Jonasâ abduction. Attached to this Progress Report was Virgilio Eustaquioâs sworn affidavit stating that: (1) he was one of the victims of the abduction incident on May 22, 2006, otherwise known as the âERAP FIVEâ incident; (2) as a result of this incident, they filed a case with the Ombudsman against Commodore Leonardo Calderon and other members of the Intelligence Service, AFP (
ISAFP
) for arbitrary detention, unlawful arrest, maltreatment of prisoners, grave threats, incriminatory machination and robbery; and (3) the male abductor of Jonas appearing in the cartographic sketch shown to him by the CHR was among the raiders who abducted him and his four companions because it resembled the cartographic sketch he described in relation to the ERAP FIVE incident on May 22, 2006.
After reviewing the submissions of both the respondents
[20]
 and the CHR
[21]
 pursuant to the Courtâs July 5, 2011, August 23, 2011 and October 11, 2011 Resolutions, we resolve to grant the CHR access to these requested documents to allow them the opportunity to ascertain the true identities of the persons depicted in the cartographic sketches.
At this point, we emphasize that the sworn affidavit of Eustaquio (that attests to the resemblance of one of Jonasâ abductors to the abductors of the ERAP FIVE) constitutes the sought-after missing link that establishes the relevance of the requested documents to the present case. We note that this lead may help the CHR ascertain the identities of those depicted in the cartographic sketches as two of Jonasâ abductors (one male and one female) who, to this day, remain unidentified.
In view of the sensitive and confidential nature of the requested documents, we direct the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court to allow the duly-authorized representatives of the CHR to inspect the requested documents 
in camera
 within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution. The documents shall be examined and compared with the cartographic sketches of the two abductors of Jonas, without copying and without bringing the documents outside the premises of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court. The inspection of the documents shall be within office hours and for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow the CHR to comprehensively investigate the lead provided by Eustaquio.
To fully fulfill the objective of the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
, further investigation using the standard of extraordinary diligence should be undertaken by the CHR to pursue the lead provided by Eustaquio. We take judicial notice of the ongoing investigation being conducted by the Department of Justice (
DOJ
), through the NBI, on the disappearance of Jonas.
[22]
 In this regard, we direct the NBI to coordinate and provide direct investigative assistance to the CHR as the latter may require, pursuant to the authority granted under the Courtâs June 22, 2010 Resolution.
For this purpose, we require the CHR to submit a supplemental investigation report to the DOJ, copy furnished the petitioner, the NBI, the incumbent Chiefs of the AFP, the PNP and the PNP-CIDG, and all the respondents within sixty days (60) days from receipt of this Resolution.
B. On the Urgent Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela  
After reviewing the newly discovered evidence submitted by the petitioner and considering all the developments of the case, including the March 18, 2013 CA decision that confirmed the validity of the issuance of the Writ of 
Amparo
 in the present case, we resolve to deny the petitionerâs Urgent 
Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
.
We note and conclude, based on the developments highlighted above, that the beneficial purpose of the Writ of 
Amparo
 has been served in the present case. As we held in 
Razon, Jr. v. Tagitis
,
[23]
 the writ merely embodies the Courtâs directives
 
to police agencies to undertake specified courses of action
 
to address the enforced disappearance of an individual. The Writ of 
Amparo
 serves both a 
preventive
 and a 
curative
 role. It is 
curative
 as it facilitates the subsequent punishment of perpetrators through the investigation and remedial action that it directs.
[24]
 The focus is on procedural curative remedies rather than on the tracking of a specific criminal or the resolution of administrative liabilities. The unique nature of 
Amparo
 proceedings has led us to define terms or concepts specific to what the proceedings seek to achieve. In 
Razon Jr., v. Tagitis
,
[25]
 we defined what the terms âresponsibilityâ and âaccountabilityâ signify in an Amparo case. We said:
Responsibility
 
refers to the extent the actors have been established by substantial evidence to have participated in whatever way, by action or omission, in an enforced disappearance, as a measure of the remedies this Court shall craft, among them, the directive to file the appropriate criminal and civil cases against the responsible parties in the proper courts. 
Accountability
, 
on the other hand, refers to the measure of remedies that should be addressed to those who exhibited involvement in the enforced disappearance without bringing the level of their complicity to the level of responsibility defined above; or who are imputed with knowledge relating to the enforced disappearance and who carry the burden of disclosure; or those who carry, but have failed to discharge, the burden of extraordinary diligence in the investigation of the enforced disappearance.
[26]
In the present case, while Jonas remains missing, the series of calculated directives issued by the Court outlined above and the extraordinary diligence the CHR demonstrated in its investigations resulted in the criminal prosecution of Lt. Baliaga. We take judicial notice of the fact that the Regional Trial Court, Quezon City, Branch 216, has already found probable cause for arbitrary detention against Lt. Baliaga and has ordered his arrest in connection with Jonasâ disappearance.
[27]
We also emphasize that the CA in its March 18, 2013 decision
 
already ruled with finality
 
on the entities responsible and accountable (as these terms are defined in 
Razon, Jr. v. Tagitis
) for the enforced disappearance of Jonas. In its March 18, 2013 decision, the CA found, by substantial evidence, that Lt. Baliaga participated in the abduction on the basis of Cabintoyâs positive identification that he was one of the abductors of Jonas who told him not to interfere because the latter had been under surveillance for drugs. In the same Decision, the CA also held the AFP and the PNP accountable for having failed to discharge the burden of extraordinary diligence in the investigation of the enforced disappearance of Jonas. Thus, the CA issued the following directives to address the enforced disappearance of Jonas:
(1) 
DIRECT the PNP through its investigative arm, the PNP-CIDG, to identify and locate the abductors of Jonas Burgos who are still at large and to establish the link between the abductors of Jonas Burgos and those involved in the ERAP 5 incident;
(2) 
DIRECT the incumbent Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Director General of the Philippines National Police, and their successors, to ensure the continuance of their investigation and coordination on the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos until the persons found responsible are brought before the bar of justice;
(3)
 
DIRECT the Commission on Human Rights to continue with its own independent investigation on the enforced disappearance of Jonas Burgos with the same degree of diligence required under the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
;
(4) 
DIRECT the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to extend full assistance to the Commission on Human Rights in the conduct of the latterâs investigation; and
(5)
 
DIRECT the Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Director General, Philippine National Police and the Chairman, Commission on Human Rights to submit a quarterly report to the Court on the results of their respective investigation.
[28]
We note that the respondents did not appeal the March 18, 2013 CA decision and the May 23, 2013 CA resolution denying their motion for partial reconsideration.
Based on the above considerations, in particular, the final ruling of the CA that confirmed the validity of the issuance of the Writ of 
Amparo
 and its determination of the entities responsible for the enforced disappearance of Jonas, we resolve to deny the petitionerâs prayer to issue the writ of 
Amparo
 anew and to refer the case to the CA based on the newly discovered evidence. We so conclude as the petitionerâs request for the reissuance of the writ and for the rehearing of the case by the CA would be redundant and superfluous in light of: (1) the ongoing investigation being conducted by the DOJ through the NBI; (2) the CHR investigation directed by the Court in this Resolution; and (3) the continuing investigation directed by the CA in its March 18, 2013 decision.
We emphasize that while the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
 accords the Court a wide latitude in crafting remedies to address an enforced disappearance, it cannot (without violating the nature of the writ of 
Amparo
 as a summary remedy that provides rapid judicial relief) grant remedies that would complicate and prolong rather than expedite the investigations already ongoing. Note that the CA has already determined with finality that Jonas was a victim of enforced disappearance.
We clarify that by denying the petitionerâs motion, we do not thereby rule on the admissibility or the merits of the newly discovered evidence submitted by the petitioner. We likewise do not foreclose any investigation by the proper investigative and prosecutory agencies of the other entities whose identities and participation in the enforced disappearance of Jonas may be disclosed in future investigations and proceedings. Considering that the present case has already reached the prosecution stage, the petitionerâs motion should have been filed with the proper investigative and prosecutory agencies of the government.
To expedite proceedings, we refer the petitionerâs motion, this Resolution and its covered cases to the DOJ for investigation, 
for the purpose of filing the appropriate criminal charges
 in the proper courts against the proper parties, if warranted, based on the gathered evidence. For this purpose, we direct the petitioner to furnish the DOJ and the NBI copies of her Urgent 
Ex Parte Motion Ex Abundanti Cautela
, together with the sealed attachments to the Motion, within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution.
As mentioned, we take judicial notice of the ongoing investigation by the DOJ, through the NBI, of the disappearance of Jonas. This DOJ investigation is without prejudice to the Office of the Ombudsmanâs exercise of its primary jurisdiction over the investigation of the criminal aspect of this case should the case be determined to be cognizable by the Sandiganbayan.
[29]
As we direct below, further investigation for purposes of the present proceedings shall continue to be undertaken by the CHR, in close coordination with the NBI, for the completion of the investigation under the terms of our June 22, 2010 Resolution and the additional directives under the present Resolution.
As a final note, we emphasize that our ROLE in a writ of 
Amparo
 proceeding is merely to determine whether an enforced disappearance has taken place; to determine who is responsible or accountable; and to define and impose the appropriate remedies to address the disappearance.
As shown above, the beneficial purpose of the Writ of 
Amparo
 has been served in the present case with the CAâs final determination of the persons responsible and accountable for the enforced disappearance of Jonas and the commencement of criminal action against Lt. Baliaga. At this stage, criminal, investigation and prosecution proceedings are already beyond the reach of the Writ of 
Amparo
 proceeding now before us.
Based on the above developments, we now hold that the full extent of the remedies envisioned by the Rule on the Writ of 
Amparo
 has been served and exhausted.Considering the foregoing, the Court
RESOLVES
 to:
(1)
DENY

The referral to the Department of Justice is without prejudice to the Office of the Ombudsmanâs exercise of its primary jurisdiction over the investigation should the case be determined to be cognizable by the Sandiganbayan;
(3)

 Section 15 (1) of the Ombudsman Act of 1989 which provides:
The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties:
(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.
 
It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases.
