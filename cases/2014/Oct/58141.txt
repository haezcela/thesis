SERENO, C.J.:


G.R. No. 187702 is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeking to nullify the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision
[1]
 dated 18 March 2009 in CA-G.R. SP No. 106006. G.R. No. 189014 is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the same Decision, as well as the CA Resolution
[2]
 dated 9 July 2009. On 12 October 2009, the Court resolved to consolidate the two cases. 
[3]
The CA Decision ruled that because controversies involving the validation of proxies are considered election contests under the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies, they are properly cognizable by the regular courts, not by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The CA Resolution denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Astra Securities Corporation.
FACTS
Omico Corporation (Omico) is a company whose shares of stock are 
listed and traded in the Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc.
[4]
 Astra Securities Corporation (Astra) is one of the stockholders of Omico owning about 18% of the latterâs outstanding capital stock.
[5]
Omico scheduled its annual stockholdersâ meeting on 3 November 2008.
[6]
 It set the deadline for submission of proxies on 23 October 2008 and the validation of proxies on 25 October 2008.
Astra objected to the validation of the proxies issued in favor of Tommy Kin Hing Tia (Tia), representing about 38% of the outstanding capital stock of Omico.
[7]
 Astra also objected to the inclusion of the proxies issued in favor of Tia and/or Martin Buncio, representing about 2% of the outstanding capital stock of Omico.
[8]
Astra maintained that the proxy issuers, who were brokers, did not obtain the required express written authorization of their clients when they issued the proxies in favor of Tia. In so doing, the issuers were allegedly in violation of SRC Rule 20(11)(b)(xviii)
[9]
 of the Amended Securities Regulation Code (SRC or Republic Act No. 8799) Rules.
[10]
 Furthermore, the proxies issued in favor of Tia exceeded 19, thereby giving rise to the presumption of solicitation thereof under SRC Rule 20(2)(B)(ii)(b)
[11]
 of the Amended SRC Rules. Tia did not comply with the rules on proxy solicitation, in violation of Section 20.1
[12]
 of the SRC.
Despite the objections of Astra, Omicoâs Board of Inspectors declared that the proxies issued in favor of Tia were valid.
[13]
On 27 October 2008, Astra filed a Complaint
[14]
 before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) praying for the invalidation of the proxies issued in favor of Tia. Astra also prayed for the issuance of a cease and desist order (CDO) enjoining the holding of Omicoâs annual stockholdersâ meeting until the SEC had resolved the issues pertaining to the validation of proxies.
On 30 October 2008, SEC issued the CDO enjoining Omico from accepting and including the questioned proxies in determining a quorum and in electing the members of the board of directors during the annual stockholdersâ meeting on 3 November 2008.
[15]
Attempts to serve the CDO on 3 November 2008 failed, and the stockholdersâ meeting proceeded as scheduled with 52.3% of the outstanding capital stock of Omico present in person or by proxy.
[16]
 The nominees for the board of directors were elected upon motion.
[17]
Astra instituted before the SEC a Complaint
[18]
 for indirect contempt against Omico for disobedience of the CDO. On the other hand, Omico filed before the CA a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition
[19]
 imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the SEC for issuing the CDO.
RULING OF THE CA
In the assailed Decision dated 18 March 2009, the CA declared the CDO null and void.
[20]
The CA held that the controversy was an intra-corporate dispute.
[21]
 The SRC expressly transferred the jurisdiction over actions involving intra-corporate controversies from the SEC to the regional trial courts.
[22]
 Furthermore, Section 2, Rule 6
[23]
 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Disputes,
[24]
 provides that any controversy or dispute involving the validation of proxies is an election contest, the jurisdiction over which has also been transferred by the SRC to the regular courts.
[25]
Thus, according to the CA, the SEC committed grave abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of Astraâs complaint.
[26]
 The CDO was a patent nullity, for an order issued without jurisdiction is no order at all.
Aggrieved by the CA Decision, the SEC filed before us the instant Petition for Certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 187702.
[27]
 Meanwhile, Astra filed a Motion for Reconsideration before the CA,
[28]
 which subsequently denied the motion in the assailed Resolution dated 9 July 2009.
On 14 September 2009, Astra filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari docketed as G.R. No. 189014.
[29]
 The Court consolidated the two petitions on 12 October 2009.
[30]
ISSUE
Whether the SEC has jurisdiction over controversies arising from the validation of proxies for the election of the directors of a corporation.
OUR RULING
About a month after the CA issued the assailed Decision, this Court promulgated 
GSIS v. CA,
[31]
 which squarely answered the above issue in the negative.
In that case, we observed that Section 6
[32] 
(g) of Presidential Decree No. (P.D.) 902-A dated 11 March 1976 conferred on SEC the power â[t]o pass upon the validity of the issuance and use of proxies and voting trust agreements for absent stockholders or members.â Section 6, however, opens thus: âIn order to effectively exercise such jurisdiction x x x.â This opening clearly refers to the preceding Section 5.
[33]
 The Court pointed out therein that the power to pass upon the validity of proxies was merely incidental or ancillary to the powers conferred on the SEC under Section 5 of the same decree. With the passage of the SRC, the powers granted to SEC under Section 5 were withdrawn, together with the incidental and ancillary powers enumerated in Section 6.
While the regular courts now had the power to hear and decide cases involving controversies in the election of directors, it was not clear whether the SRC also transferred to these courts the incidental and ancillary powers of the SEC as enumerated in Section 6 of P.D. 902-A. Thus, in 
GSIS v. CA,
 it was necessary for the Court to determine whether the action to invalidate the proxies was intimately tied to an election controversy. Hence, the Court pronounced:
Under Section 5(c) of Presidential Decree No. 902-A, in relation to the SRC, the jurisdiction of the regular trial courts with respect to election-related controversies is specifically confined to âcontroversies in the election or appointment of directors, trustees, officers or managers of corporations, partnerships, or associations.â 
Evidently, the jurisdiction of the regular courts over so-called election contests or controversies under Section 5 (c) does not extend to every potential subject that may be voted on by shareholders, but only to the election of directors or trustees, in which stockholders are authorized to participate under Section 24 of the Corporation Code.
This qualification allows for a useful distinction that gives due effect to the statutory right of the SEC to regulate proxy solicitation, and the statutory jurisdiction of regular courts over election contests or controversies. The power of the SEC to investigate violations of its rules on proxy solicitation is unquestioned when proxies are obtained to vote on matters unrelated to the cases enumerated under Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A.
 However, when proxies are solicited in relation to the election of corporate directors, the resulting controversy, even if it ostensibly raised the violation of the SEC rules on proxy solicitation, should be properly seen as an election controversy within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the trial courts by virtue of Section 5.2 of the SRC in relation to Section 5 (c) of Presidential Decree No. 902-A.
The conferment of original and exclusive jurisdiction on the regular courts over such controversies in the election of corporate directors must be seen as intended to confine to one body the adjudication of all related claims and controversy arising from the election of such directors. For that reason, the aforequoted Section 2, Rule 6 of the Interim Rules broadly defines the term âelection contestâ as encompassing all plausible incidents arising from the election of corporate directors, including: (1) any controversy or dispute involving title or claim to any elective office in a stock or nonstock corporation, (2) 
the validation of proxies
, (3) the manner and validity of elections and (4) the qualifications of candidates, including the proclamation of winners. If all matters anteceding the holding of such election which affect its manner and conduct, such as the proxy solicitation process, are deemed within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC, then the prospect of overlapping and competing jurisdictions between that body and the regular courts becomes frighteningly real. From the language of Section 5 (c) of Presidential Decree No. 902-A, it is indubitable that controversies as to the qualification of voting shares, or the validity of votes cast in favor of a candidate for election to the board of directors are properly cognizable and adjudicable by the regular courts exercising original and exclusive jurisdiction over election cases.
[34]
 x x x.
The ruling harmonizes the seeming conflict between the Amended SRC Rules promulgated by the SEC and the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Disputes promulgated by the Court.

 In the validation of proxies

. (Emphasis supplied)
On the other hand, these are the provisions of Section 1, Rule 1; and Section 2, Rule 6 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Disputes:
RULE 1
General Provisions
SECTION 1. (a) 
Cases Covered
 â 
These Rules shall govern the procedure to be observed in civil cases involving the following:
a) Devices or schemes employed by, or any act of, the board of directors, business associates, officers or partners, amounting to fraud or misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholders, partners, or members of any corporation, partnership, or association;
b) Controversies arising out of intra-corporate, partnership, or association relations, between and among stockholders, members, or associates; and between, any or all of them and the corporation, partnership, or association of which they are stockholders, members, or associates, respectively;
c) Controversies in the election or appointment of directors, trustees, officers, or managers of corporations, partnerships, or associations;
d) Derivative suits; and
e) Inspection of corporate books.

RULE 6
Election Contests
x x x x
SECTION 2. 
Definition.
 â 
An election contest refers to any controversy or dispute involving
 title or claim to any elective office in a stock or non-stock corporation, 
the validation of proxies
, the manner and validity of elections, and the qualifications of candidates, including the proclamation of winners, to the office of director, trustee or other officer directly elected by the stockholders in a close corporation or by members of a non-stock corporation where the articles of incorporation or by-laws so provide. (Emphases supplied)
The Court explained that the power of the SEC to regulate proxies remains in place in instances when stockholders vote on matters other than the election of directors.
[35]
 The test is whether the controversy relates to such election. All matters affecting the manner and conduct of the election of directors are properly cognizable by the regular courts. Otherwise, these matters may be brought before the SEC for resolution based on the regulatory powers it exercises over corporations, partnerships and associations.
Astra endeavors to remove the instant case from the ambit of 
GSIS v. CA
 by arguing that 1) the validation of proxies in this case relates to the determination of the existence of a quorum; and 2) no actual voting for the members of the board of directors was conducted, as the directors were merely elected by motion.
Indeed, the validation of proxies in this case relates to the determination of the existence of a quorum. Nonetheless, it is a quorum for the election of the directors, and, as such, which requires the presence â in person or by proxy â of the owners of the majority of the outstanding capital stock of Omico.
[36]
 Also, the fact that there was no actual voting did not make the election any less so, especially since Astra had never denied that an election of directors took place.
We find no merit either in the proposal of Astra regarding the âtwo (2) viable, non-exclusive and successive legal remedies to question the validity of proxies.â
[37]
 It suggests that the power to pass upon the validity of proxies to determine the existence of a quorum prior to the conduct of the stockholdersâ meeting should lie with the SEC; but, after the stockholdersâ meeting, questions regarding the use of invalid proxies in the election of directors should be cognizable by the regular courts, since there was already an election to speak of.
First, this interpretation is akin to the argument struck down by the Court in 
GSIS v. CA
. If the Court adopts the suggestion, âwe would be perpetually confronted with the spectacle of election controversies being heard and adjudicated by both the SEC and the regular courts, made possible through a mere allegation that the anteceding x x x process was errant, but the competing cases [were] filed with one objective in mind â to affect the outcome of the election of the board of directors.â
[38]
Second, the validation of proxies serves a number of purposes, including determining the existence of a quorum and ascertaining the authenticity of proxies to be used for the election of directors at the stockholdersâ meeting. Section 2, Rule 6, of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Disputes provides that an election contest covers any controversy or dispute involving the validation of proxies, in general. Thus, it can only refer to all the beneficial purposes that validation of proxies can bring about when made in connection with a forthcoming election of directors. Thus, there is no point in making distinctions between who has jurisdiction before and who has jurisdiction after the election of directors, as all controversies related thereto â whether before, during or after â shall be passed upon by regular courts as provided by law.
The Court closes with an observation.
As in the instant cases, 
GSIS v. CA
 is a consolidation of two cases, one of which was filed by a private party and the other by the SEC itself. In both cases, the parties were aggrieved by the CA ruling, so they filed the cases seeking a pronouncement from the Court that it recognizes the jurisdiction of the SEC over the controversy.
Calling to mind established jurisprudential principles, the Court therein ruled that quasi-judicial agencies do not have the right to seek the review of an appellate court decision reversing any of their rulings.
[39]
 This is because they are not real parties-in-interest. Thus, the Court expunged the petition filed by the SEC for the latterâs lack of capacity to file the suit. So it must be in the instant cases.
WHEREFORE
, the petition in G.R. No. 187702 is 
EXPUNGED
 for lack of capacity of petitioner to file the suit.
The petition in G.R. No. 189014 is 
DENIED.
 The Court of Appeals Decision dated 18 March 2009 and Resolution dated 9 July 2009 in CA-G.R. SP No. 106006 are
