The Facts
TSC is a value-added tax (VAT) payer duly registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). It is principally engaged in the business of electric power generation and the sale of electric power to National Power Corporation (NPC) under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Scheme.
On 19 December 2003, TSC applied for the VAT zero-rating of its sale of electric power to NPC for the taxable year 2004. TSCâs application was subsequently approved by the BIR.
On 26 April 2004, 26 July 2004, 25 October 2004 and 25 January 2005, TSC filed its quarterly VAT returns for the four quarters of 2004 with the BIR, through the Electronic Filing and Payment Scheme (EFPS). On 26 July 2004 and on 3 August 2005, TSC filed its amended quarterly VAT returns for the first and fourth quarters of 2004, respectively.
The quarterly VAT returns for the four quarters of 2004 provide:

On 21 December 2005, TSC filed an administrative claim for refund of its input VAT, which it incurred for the four quarters of 2004.
On 24 April 2006, due to the BIRâs inaction, TSC filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). TSC prayed for the refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for its alleged unutilized input VAT for year 2004.
The Court of Tax Appealsâ Ruling: Division
In its 4 March 2010 Decision,
[6]
 the CTA Special First Division ruled that TSCâs sale of electric power to NPC was effectively zero-rated. The CTA Special First Division found that TSC complied with the five requirements to be entitled to a refund or issuance of tax credit certificate on its input VAT, to wit:
1. That there must be zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;
2. That input taxes were incurred or paid;
3. That such input taxes are attributable to zero-rated sales or effectively zero-rated sales;
4. That the input taxes were not applied against any output VAT liability; and
5. That the claim for refund was filed within the two-year prescriptive period.
[7]
The CTA Special First Division found that TSC is entitled to a refund or issuance of tax credit certificate in the amount of P78,009,891.56
[8]
 input VAT, upon disallowance of the amounts of: (1) P568,628,238.98 for being sales of electric power to Mirant Philippines Energy Corporation, Mirant Philippines Industrial Power Corporation, and Mirant Philippines Industrial Power II Corporation; (2) P2,430,229,567.30 zero-rated sales to NPC for not being properly supported by VAT official receipts; and (3) P5,490,632.64 input VAT for failure to meet the substantiation requirement. The CTA Special First Division likewise ruled that both the administrative and the judicial claims of TSC were filed within the two-year prescriptive period.
The dispositive portion of the CTA Special First Divisionâs 4 March 2010 Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, the instant Petition for Review is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly, respondent is hereby ORDERED to REFUND or to ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE in the amount of SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE PESOS AND 56/100 (P78,009,891.56) to petitioner, representing unutilized excess input VAT attributable to its effectively zero-rated sales to NPC for the four quarters of taxable year 2004.
SO ORDERED.
[9]
On 19 May 2010, the CTA Special First Division granted the motion for partial new trial filed by TSC and allowed it to present in evidence the correct official receipts supporting the P2,430,229,567.30 zero-rated sales made to NPC. The CTA Special First Division likewise held in abeyance the resolution of the motion for reconsideration filed by both parties.
In an Amended Decision dated 5 April 2011, the CTA Special First Division found that TSC is entitled to a modified amount of P96,846,234.31 input VAT,
[10]
 upon: (1) allowing the amount of P2,430,229,567.30 zero-rated sales made to NPC; (2) disallowing the amount of P7,232,794.92 zero-rated sales because its official receipt was dated outside the period of claim; and (3) allowing the amount of P3,094,606.10 input VAT for being properly substantiated.
The dispositive portion of the CTA Special First Divisionâs 5 April 2011 Amended Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondentâs âMotion for Partial Reconsiderationâ is hereby DENIED for lack of merit while petitionerâs âMotion for Partial Reconsiderationâ is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED.
Accordingly, petitionerâs claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate representing unutilized input VAT for taxable year 2004 is GRANTED in the total adjusted amount of NINETY SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR PESOS AND 31/100 (P96,846,234.31) or an additional EIGHTEEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO PESOS AND 75/100 (P18,836,342.75) on its previously granted claim of SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE PESOS AND 56/100 (P78,009,891.56).
SO ORDERED.
[11]
Thus, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) filed a petition for review with the CTA EB.
The Court of Tax Appealsâ Ruling: En Banc
In a Decision dated 27 July 2012, the CTA EB found that TSC submitted the relevant documents applicable to its claim. According to the CTA EB, the submitted documents constituted compliance with the requirements of Revenue Memorandum Order No. (RMO) 53-98. Thus, the CTA EB ruled that the judicial claim was not prematurely filed.
The dispositive portion of the CTA EBâs 27 July 2012 Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present Petition for Review is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE, and, accordingly DISMISSED for lack of merit. The Amended Decision dated April 5, 2011 is hereby AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.
[12]
In a Resolution dated 6 December 2012, the CTA EB denied the motion for reconsideration filed by the CIR for lack of merit. Hence, this petition.
The Issue
The CIR raises this sole issue for resolution:
THE [CTA EB] GRAVELY ERRED IN DENYING DUE COURSE TO [CIR]âS PETITION FOR REVIEW IN [CTA] EB NO. 768 AND IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF ITS SPECIAL FIRST DIVISION THAT [TSC] IS ENTITLED TO A REFUND OR TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE IN THE AMOUNT OF P96,846,234.31 BECAUSE IT WAS ABLE TO SUBMIT THE LEGALLY REQUIRED DOCUMENTS IN ITS APPLICATION FOR REFUND.
[13]
The Ruling of the Court
The petition lacks merit.
The relevant portions of Section 112 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), which provide the requirements to enable the taxpayer to claim a refund or credit of its input tax, state:
Sec. 112. 
Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax.
 â
(A) 
Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales
âAny VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: 
Provided, however,
 That in the case of zero- rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (B) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the 
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
 (BSP): 
Provided, further,
 That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales
x x x x
(C) 
Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made. 
â In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsection (A) hereof.
In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals.
[14]
Under Section 112(C) of the NIRC, the CIR has 120 days to decide the taxpayerâs claim from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Section 112(A) of the 
NIRC. In Intel Technology v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
,
[15]
 we ruled that once the taxpayer has established by sufficient evidence that it is entitled to a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate, in accordance with the requirements of Section 112(A) of the NIRC, its claim should be granted.
In 
Atlas Consolidated Mining v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
[16]
 we held that applications for refund or credit of input tax with the BIR must comply with the appropriate revenue regulations. Thus, applications must be in accordance with Section 2 of Revenue Regulations No. 3-88 (RR 3-88), amending Section 16 of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, to wit:
SECTION 2. Section 16 of Revenue Regulations 5-87 is hereby amended to read as follows:
SECTION 16. Refunds or tax credits of input tax. â
x x x x
(c)  Claims for tax credits/refunds. â Application for Tax Credit/Refund of Value-Added Tax Paid (BIR Form No. 2552) shall be filed with the Revenue District Office of the city or municipality where the principal place of business of the applicant is located or directly with the Commissioner, Attention: VAT Division.
A photocopy of the purchase invoice or receipt evidencing the value added tax paid shall be submitted together with the application. The original copy of the said invoice/receipt, however, shall be presented for cancellation prior to the issuance of the Tax Credit Certificate or refund. In addition, the following documents shall be attached whenever applicable:
x x x x
3. Effectively zero-rated sale of goods and services.
i) photocopy of approved application for zero-rate if filing for the first time.
ii) sales invoice or receipt showing name of the person or entity to whom the sale of goods or services were delivered, date of delivery, amount of consideration, and description of goods or services delivered. iii) evidence of actual receipt of goods or services.
x x x x
5. In applicable cases, where the applicantâs zero-rated transactions are regulated by certain government agencies, a statement therefrom showing the amount and description of sale of goods and services, name of persons or entities (except in case of exports) to whom the goods or services were sold, and date of transaction shall also be submitted.
In all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of the value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.
Where the applicant is engaged in zero-rated and other taxable and exempt sales of goods and services, and the VAT paid (inputs) on purchases of goods and services cannot be directly attributed to any of the aforementioned transactions, the following formula shall be used to determine the creditable or refundable input tax for zero-rated sale:
Amount of Zero-rated Sale
Total Sales
X
Total Amount of Input Taxes
=
Amount Creditable/Refundable 
x x x x
We likewise applied RR 3-88 in 
AT&T Communications Services Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
[17]
 and held that only preponderance of evidence as applied in ordinary civil cases is needed to substantiate a claim for tax refund.
In the present case, the CTA Special First Division found that TSC complied with the requirements of Section 112(A) of the NIRC and granted its claim for refund or credit of P78,009,891.56 input VAT. Upon a partial new trial, the CTA Special First Division increased the amount to P96,846,234.31. Upon appeal, the CTA EB concluded that TSC submitted the relevant documents to substantiate its claim for refund or credit of input tax, to wit:
1. BIR Certificate of Registration (Annex âAâ, Petition for Review, CTA Case No. 7470, vol. 1, p. 13);
2. Quarterly VAT returns for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 (Exhibits âDâ, âEâ, âFâ, âGâ, & âHâ);
3. Summary of Input Tax Payments for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 showing details of purchases of goods and service as well as the corresponding input tax paid (Exhibits âDâ to âD-
3â, âEâ to âE-5-bâ, âFâ to âF-4-bâ, âH-3â to âH-4-câ);
4. VAT official receipts and invoices for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 (Exhibits âQQâ-7â to âQQ-21-dâ, âRR-17â, âSS-1â to âSS-19â & âTT-1â to TT-18â);
5. Approved Certificate for Zero-Rate (Exhibit âAâ); and
6. Application for Tax Credit/Refund (BIR Form 1914) (Exhibit âB-3â)
[18]
We adopt the above-mentioned findings of fact of the CTA Special First Division, as affirmed by the CTA EB. Whether TSC complied with the substantiation requirements of Section 112 of the NIRC and RR 3-88 is a question of fact,
[19]
 which could only be answered after reviewing, examining, evaluating, or weighing all over again the probative value of the evidence before the CTA, which this Court does not have reason to do in the present petition for review on certiorari. The findings of fact of the CTA are not to be disturbed unless clearly shown to be unsupported by substantial evidence.
[20]
 Since by the very nature of its functions, the CTA has developed an expertise on this subject, the Court will not set aside lightly the conclusions reached by them, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.
[21]
The CIR, however, insists that TSC failed to submit the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98. Thus, the 120-day period given for it to decide allegedly did not commence.
The CIRâs reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced. There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of a refund or credit of input VAT. The subject of RMO 53-98 states that it is a âChecklist of Documents to be Submitted by a Taxpayer upon 
Audit 
of his Tax Liabilities x x x.â In this case, TSC was applying for a grant of refund or credit of its input tax. There was no allegation of an audit being conducted by the CIR. Even assuming that RMO 53-98 applies, it specifically states that some documents are required to be submitted by the taxpayer âif applicable.â
[22]
Moreover, if TSC indeed failed to submit the complete documents in support of its application, the CIR could have informed TSC of its failure, consistent with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 42-03.
[23]
  However, the CIR did not inform TSC of the document it failed to submit, even up to the present petition. The CIR likewise raised the issue of TSCâs alleged failure to submit the complete documents only in its motion for reconsideration of the CTA Special First Divisionâs 4 March 2010 Decision.  Accordingly, we affirm the CTA EBâs finding that TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, and submitted the complete documents in support of its application for refund or credit of its input tax 
at the same time.
Under Section 112(C) of the NIRC, in case of failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application, the taxpayer affected may, within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period, appeal the unacted claim with the CTA. The charter of the CTA
[24]
 also expressly provides that if the Commissioner fails to decide within "a specific period" required by law, such "inaction shall be deemed a denial" of the application for tax refund or credit. In 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation,
[25]
 we emphasized that compliance with the 120-day waiting period is mandatory and 
jurisdictional
. In this case, when TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, the CIR had a period of 120 days, or until 20 April 2006, to act on the claim. However, the CIR failed to act on TSC's claim within this 120-day period. Thus, TSC filed its petition for review with the CTA on 24 April 2006 or within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Accordingly, we do not find merit in the CIR's argument that the judicial claim was prematurely filed.
WHEREFORE
, we 
DENY
 the petition for lack of merit. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals, dated 27 July 2012 and 6 December 2012, respectively, are 
AFFIRMED
