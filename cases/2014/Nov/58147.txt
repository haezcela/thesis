VILLARAMA, JR., J.:


Before this Court is an Amended Petition
[1]
 for Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and a Writ of Preliminary Injunction filed by petitioner Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines Employeesâ Union (CAAP-EU) formerly Air Transportation Employeesâ Union (ATEU) (petitioner) â a legitimate union of employees of respondent Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP). Petitioner prays that the Court direct all respondents to desist from promulgating and implementing Authority Orders, Memoranda and all other issuances relating to the filling up of positions within the CAAP whether existing or newly created, and praying that the Court nullify and set aside the following:
Authority Order No. 77-08;
[2]
Authority Order No. 118-08;
[3]
Authority Order No. 139-08;
[4]
 Authority Order No. 163-08;
[5]
Authority Order No. 172-08;
[6]
Authority Order No. 173-08;
[7]
Authority Order No. 181-08;
[8]
Authority Order No. 81-09;
[9]
Authority Order No. 82-09;
[10]
 and
Authority Order No. 83-09
[11]
all issued by respondent Ruben F. Ciron, former Acting Director General of the CAAP allegedly with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or in excess of jurisdiction. Petitioner asserts that such grave abuse of discretion was shown by the issuances of said Authority Orders and Memoranda which resulted in the classification and treatment of the incumbent personnel of the Air Transportation Office (ATO), now of CAAP, into âhold-overâ status, thus violating the provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9497
[12]
 otherwise known as the 
Civil Aviation Authority Act of 2008
 and the security of tenure of government employees guaranteed by the 
1987 Constitution
 and R.A. No. 6656.
[13]
 
A brief historical background of the CAAP is in order.
[14]
On November 20, 1931, the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. 3909
[15]
 providing that the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Communications has the duty, among others, to foster air commerce, encourage the establishment of airports, civil airways and other navigation facilities and investigate causes of air mishaps. As such, said Secretary has the power to administer and enforce air traffic rules, issue or revoke licenses and issue regulations necessary to execute his vested functions.
On December 5, 1932, Act No. 3996
[16]
 amended Act No. 3909 as to matters concerning the licensing of airmen and aircraft, inspection of aircraft, air traffic rules, schedules and rates and enforcement of aviation laws.
On December 9, 1932, Act No. 4033
[17]
 was approved, providing, among others, that no aviation public service, including those of foreign aircrafts, shall operate in the Philippines without having first secured from the Philippine Legislature a franchise to operate an air service.
[18]
CAAP narrated that from 1932 to 1936, there were no standard procedures as to the licensing of airmen, registration of aircraft and recording of various aeronautical activities connected with commercial aviation. There were attempts made to register planes and their owners without ascertaining their airworthiness and to record names of pilots, airplane mechanics and other details. It was also narrated that in 1933, the office of Technical Assistant of Aviation Matters was expanded into the Aeronautics Division under the Department of Commerce and Industry, the functions of which were embodied in Administrative Order No. 309, a joint Bulletin issued by the Department of Public Works and Communications and the Department of Finance.
[19]
On November 12, 1936, the National Assembly passed Commonwealth Act No. 168,
[20]
 otherwise known as the 
Civil Aviation Law of the Philippines
, creating the Bureau of Aeronautics and organizing the same under the Department of Public Works and Communications.
[21]
 After the liberation of the Philippines in March 1945, the Bureau was reorganized and placed under the Department of National Defense. Among its functions was to promulgate civil aviation regulations.
[22]
On October, 1947, Executive Order (E.O.) No. 94 which reorganized the government, transferred the Bureau of Aeronautics to the newly created Department of Commerce and Industry and renamed the same as the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).
[23]
On June 5, 1948, R.A. No. 224
[24]
 created the National Airports Corporation, serving as an agency of the Republic of the Philippines for the development, administration, operation and management of government-owned landing fields in the country
[25]
 except for those controlled and/or operated by the Armed Forces.
On November 10, 1950, the National Airports Corporation was abolished by E.O. No. 365
[26]
 and was replaced by the CAA.
[27]
On June 20, 1952, R.A. No. 776,
[28]
 otherwise known as the 
Civil Aeronautics Act of the Philippines
, was passed, reorganizing the Civil Aeronautics Board and the CAA, defining their respective powers and duties, making adjustments as to the funds and personnel and regulating civil aeronautics. Under R.A. No. 776, the CAA was charged with the duty of planning, designing, constructing, equipping, expanding, improving, repairing or altering aerodromes or such other structures, improvements or air navigation facilities.
[29]
On October 19, 1956, former President Ramon Magsaysay issued E.O. No. 209,
[30]
 transferring 
in toto
 the CAA to the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications from the Department of Commerce and Industry.
[31]
On January 20, 1975, Letter of Instruction No. 244, series of 1975,
[32]
 directed that all funds for the preliminary engineering, construction and maintenance of all national airports appropriated for the fiscal year 1974-75 be transferred and/or released to the Department of Public Highways. The responsibilities related to location, planning design and funding were later returned to the CAA.
[33]
On July 23, 1979, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued E.O. No. 546,
[34]
 renaming the CAA as the Bureau of Air Transportation (BAT) and placing the same under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.
[35]
Subsequently, BAT, though reorganized, was maintained under E.O. No. 125
[36]
 issued by former President Corazon C. Aquino (President Aquino) on January 30, 1987. Shortly thereafter or on April 13, 1987, President Aquino issued E.O. No. 125-A
[37]
 renaming BAT to ATO which would be headed by the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Air Transportation.
[38]
 Section 12
[39]
 of said E.O. No. 125 which contained the proviso concerning BAT was deleted by Section 2
[40]
 of E.O. No. 125-A.
As duly claimed by petitioner, sometime in the middle of 1995, the Philippine civil aviation safety oversight capability was downgraded by the United States of America (USA) through her Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) into a Category 2
[41]
 status. A Category 2 rating means a country either lacks laws or regulations necessary to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards, or that its civil aviation authority â equivalent to the FAA for aviation safety matters â is deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record keeping or inspection procedures. Correlatively, a Category 1 rating means a countryâs civil aviation authority complies with the International Civil Aviation Organization
[42]
 (ICAO) standards, thus, her air carriers can add flights and services to the USA and carry the code of USA carriers.
[43]
 Petitioner attested that sometime in the first quarter of 1997, the Category 1 status was regained by the Philippines as it was successfully initiated by the organic/incumbent personnel of the defunct ATO.
However, sometime in January 2008, the FAA reverted the Philippines to its 1995 air safety rating of Category 2 from Category 1 because of air safety regulations, practices and personnel that fell below the standards of the ICAO.
[44]
Thus, on March 4, 2008, R.A. No. 9497 was passed, whereby ATO was replaced by CAAP, to be headed by the Director General of Civil Aviation. Pursuant to Sections 4
[45]
 and 85
[46]
 thereof, the ATO was abolished, and all its powers were transferred to the CAAP. To ensure the smooth transition from ATO to CAAP, Section 86
[47]
 of R.A. No. 9497 directed the Assistant Secretary of the ATO to continue to hold office and assume the powers of the CAAP Director General until his successor shall have been appointed and inducted into office in accordance with said law. Likewise, retirement packages were provided to ATO employees who were willing to retire from the service.
On July 2, 2008, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Ruben F. Ciron as Acting Director General of the CAAP.
[48]
 Immediately upon assumption of office, Ciron issued orders and memoranda for the active participation of incumbent and organic personnel of the defunct ATO along with his hired consultants in the crafting and formulation of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9497, the new Organizational Structure and Staffing Pattern (OSSP) and the Qualification Standards (QS) for the proposed new plantilla of positions within the CAAP.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors of CAAP prepared its OSSP and the IRR of R.A. No. 9497, both of which were approved in Board Resolution No. 08-001
[49]
 dated July 30, 2008. Pursuant to Section 90
[50]
 of R.A. No. 9497, the IRR was formulated and was subsequently published in two newspapers of general circulation.
[51]
 Pertinently, Section 60 (a) of the IRR provides that the incumbent personnel of the former ATO shall continue to hold office in hold-over capacity until such time as the new Staffing Pattern and Manning shall have been approved by the Board and implemented by the CAAP Director General. Thereafter, the management of CAAP endorsed its OSSP for the approval of respondent Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in view of the latterâs authority to review reorganization details of government agencies. The OSSP was approved on July 20, 2009.
[52]
 However, petitioner lamented, among others, that the IRR, OSSP and QS approved by the CAAP Board of Directors were different from that agreed upon by the incumbent ATO personnel and Director General Ciron and his consultants.
Subsequently, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10
[53]
 and House Concurrent Resolution No. 27
[54]
 were issued, which clarified, among others, the intent of the lawmakers as regards the abolition of ATO; the hold-over status of qualified employees of ATO and the preferential status of the said employees with respect to the filling up of CAAP plantilla positions.
Aggrieved, on November 20, 2009, petitioner filed the Original Petition for Prohibition
[55]
 directly before this Court. Said petition was subsequently amended on November 25, 2009. It assails the aforementioned Authority Orders, Memoranda and other issuances related to the selection and filling up of positions issued by Director General Ciron and seeks the nullification thereof including the IRR of R.A. No. 9497, the OSSP and QS for the employees of CAAP.
Petitioner invokes the following grounds:
I.
RESPONDENTS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ISSUING AND IMPLEMENTING AUTHORITY ORDERS, MEMORANDA AND ALL OTHER ISSUANCES RELATED TO THE SELECTION AND FILLING UP OF POSITIONS IN THE CAAP, WHETHER EXISTING OR NEWLY CREATED, CONSIDERING THE ABSENCE OF POSITIONS, ITEM NUMBERS, QUALIFICATION STANDARDS AND PUBLICATION, WHICH ARE INDISPENSABLE REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO THE SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT TO ANY GOVERNMENT POST [; AND]
II.
RESPONDENTS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN EXPANDING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE âHOLD-OVERâ STATUS IN THE IMPLEMENTING RULES AND REGULATIONS OF R.A. 9497, THUS VIOLATING THE EXPRESS PROVISIONS OF R.A. 9497 AND THE SECURITY OF TENURE OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES GUARANTEED BY THE 1987 CONSTITUTION AND R.A. 6656.
[56]
Petitioner explains that it directly sought recourse from this Court because there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Even if there would be any remedy, petitioner submits that such would be ineffective given the brazenness of respondentsâ official actions. Petitioner also claims that it sought redress from the different agencies of the government but its actions were an exercise in futility because said agencies failed to act on its grievances. Petitioner further avers that since it represents government employees in an agency which is national in scope and whose function is highly imbued with public interest affecting national security and the economy, it would be paramount that its issues be resolved by this Court.
[57]
On the merits, petitioner argues, among others, that respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in the issuance and implementation of the assailed Authority Orders and Memoranda because they placed the tenure of the CAAP personnel in jeopardy in clear violation of the latterâs security of tenure which is protected by the 
1987 Constitution
[58]
 and R.A. No. 6656. Petitioner points out that while Sections 85 and 86 of R.A. No. 9497 literally abolished ATO, nevertheless, the tenor of the provisions thereof simply perpetuated and assumed the core of civil aviation regulatory functions, powers, and authority, including all assets of the defunct ATO. Petitioner also invokes the Minutes of the Discussion of the Bicameral Conference Committee on the Disagreeing Provisions of HBN 3156 and the amendments agreed upon on âThe Creation of the Civil Aviation Authority,â
[59]
 and asserts that the real intention of R.A. No. 9497 was merely reorganization of the agency and not its entire abolition. Purportedly, abolition of an office cannot have the effect of removing an officer holding it if the office is restored under another name. Petitioner further contends that while Section 86 of R.A. No. 9497 categorically states that 
âthe incumbent Assistant Secretary of the ATO shall continue to hold office and assume the powers of the Director General until his successor shall have been appointed and inducted into office,â
 the law made no mention of the status of the employment of the personnel of the defunct ATO. The employeesâ hold-over status as indicated in the IRR and in the Joint Senate Resolutions is opposed to Section 86 of R.A. No. 9497 which merely limits such status to the incumbent Assistant Secretary of the ATO as acting CAAP Director General. Likewise, petitioner asserts that the IRR expanded and modified the law and that the legislature through the issuance of said Resolutions encroached on the functions of this Court in interpreting the same. All told, petitioner submits that R.A. No. 9497 simply mandated that the selection and appointment of the heads of offices within CAAP are limited to the rank-and-file employees of the concerned or corresponding offices of the defunct ATO and that the personnel of the same, unless they opted to retire, are legally deemed transferred to the newly created CAAP. The hold-over status accorded to the incumbent personnel of the ATO deviated from the law and the same personnel were placed in a disadvantageous situation and were stripped of their security of tenure.
[60]
On the other hand, CAAP through the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) counters that the issue regarding the nullification of the assailed Authority Orders has become moot and academic. The OGCC asseverates that when the new CAAP Director General Alfonso G. Cusi (Director General Cusi) assumed office, he issued a Memorandum
[61]
 dated March 12, 2010 which provided that coterminous employees, consultants and job-order employees are deemed not employed under the CAAP unless reappointed or renewed, thus terminating the services of all the personnel appointed by Director General Ciron. The OGCC submits that there being no justiciable controversy, there is nothing for this Court to adjudicate. Moreover, the OGCC advances the view that petitioner failed to establish its right to injunctive relief as its bare and self-serving allegations failed to overthrow the presumption that CAAP regularly performed its official functions in the promulgation and/or implementation of the assailed orders. The OGCC also submits that petitioner disregarded the basic principle of the hierarchy of courts and the doctrine that this Court is not a trier of facts when petitioner directly filed the instant petition before us. The OGCC points out that, despite petitionerâs claim that it sought redress from different government agencies, petitioner failed to substantiate such claim. The selection processes assailed by petitioner, according to the OGCC, constitute triable facts and necessitate the determination and resolution of factual issues. Lastly, the OGCC questions the legal personality of petitioner to file the petition in behalf of the CAAP employees. The OGCC posits that while petitioner was registered as the employeesâ union of the now abolished ATO, petitioner was not registered with the CSC.
[62]
On this point, respondents DBM and CSC through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) opine that DBM acted within the scope of its authority when it approved the OSSP of the CAAP on July 20, 2009 as the same was done in the performance of DBMâs official functions as provided under E.O. No. 165, series of 1987.
[63]
 With its bare and unsubstantiated allegations, petitioner failed to prove that DBM acted with grave abuse of discretion in the approval thereof. Moreover, invoking that ATO was effectively abolished by R.A. No. 9497, the OSG defends the validity of Section 60(a) of the IRR which states that the incumbent personnel of the ATO shall continue to hold office in a â
hold[-]over capacity until such time [that a] new [s]taffing [p]attern and [m]anning [is] approved by the Board.
â The OSG posits that while it is true that an incumbent employee of the defunct ATO is given preference in the filling up of a plantilla position, said employee does not automatically qualify to the position he is presently holding. Thus, said employee still has to qualify under the new and approved staffing pattern and the new QS set by the CSC. Such approved QS shall be used as the standard minimum qualification requirements for purposes of appointments per 
CSC Memorandum Circular No. 03, series of 1991
. However, if the incumbent fails to qualify, the affected employee may choose from the retirement packages provided under R.A. No. 9497 itself.
[64]
 The OSG asserts that in this case the employeesâ right to security of tenure as embodied under Section 2(3),
[65]
 Article IX-B of the 
1987 Constitution
 is not undermined. The OSG avers that the CSC has not yet received any appointments from the CAAP for attestation; hence, to restrain the CSC is premature.
[66]
In essence, the issues for our resolution are:
Whether ATO was abolished under R.A. No. 9497;
Whether the incumbent ATO employeesâ constitutional right to security of tenure was impaired; and
Whether there was grave abuse of discretion when Section 60 of the IRR provided a âhold-overâ status for ATO employees, which was not expressly provided for under R.A. No. 9497.
Prefatorily, we rule that petitioner has 
locus standi
. Petitioner impugns the constitutionality of the IRR of R.A. No. 9497 and assails the validity of the abolition of the ATO and respondentsâ acts in filling up positions within CAAP. Petitionerâs members are all employees of the defunct ATO and are actually covered by the law and its IRR. Thus, they have a personal and substantial interest in the case, such that they will sustain direct injury as a result of the enforcement of R.A. No. 9497 and its IRR.
[67]
The Court agrees with the postulation of the OGCC that the nullification of the assailed Authority Orders has become moot and academic considering that Director General Cusi already issued a Memorandum
[68]
 dated March 12, 2010, terminating the services of all the personnel appointed by Director General Ciron. An issue is said to have become moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy so that a declaration on the issue would be of no practical use or value.
[69]
 The Court will therefore abstain from expressing its opinion in a case where no legal relief is needed or called for.
[70]
Nevertheless, despite this moot issue and the presence of some procedural flaws in the instant petition, such as petitionerâs disregard of the hierarchy of courts and the non-exhaustion of administrative remedies, we deem it necessary to address the essential issues. It is in the interest of the State that questions relating to the status and existence of a public office be settled without delay.
[71]
That being said, we rule that the petition is bereft of merit.
The first issue is resolved in the affirmative.
Well entrenched in this jurisdiction is the rule that the power to abolish a public office is lodged with the legislature. This proceeds from the legal precept that the power to create includes the power to destroy. A public office is created either by the Constitution, by statute, or by authority of law. Thus, except where the office was created by the Constitution itself, it may be abolished by the same legislature that brought it into existence.
[72]
Indubitably, this is the case at hand. The legislature through R.A. No. 9497 abolished the ATO as explicitly stated in Sections 4 and 85 thereof, 
viz
:
SEC. 4. 
Creation of the Authority
. â There is hereby created an independent regulatory body with quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative powers and possessing corporate attributes to be known as the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), hereinafter referred to as the âAuthorityâ, attached to the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) for the purpose of policy coordination. 
For this purpose, the existing Air Transportation Office created under the provisions of Republic Act No. 776, as amended, is hereby abolished
.
x x x x
SEC. 85. 
Abolition of the Air Transportation Office
. â 
The Air Transportation Office (ATO) created under Republic Act No. 776, a sectoral office of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), is hereby abolished.
All powers, duties and rights vested by law and exercised by the ATO is hereby transferred to the Authority.
All assets, real and personal properties, funds and revenues owned by or vested in the different offices of the ATO are transferred to the Authority. All contracts, records and documents relating to the operations of the abolished agency and its offices and branches are likewise transferred to the Authority. Any real property owned by the national government or government-owned corporation or authority which is being used and utilized as office or facility by the ATO shall be transferred and titled in favor of the Authority. (Emphasis supplied)
Verily, the question whether a law abolishes an office is a question of legislative intent. In this case, petitioner tries to raise doubts as to the real intention of Congress. However, there should not be any controversy if there is an explicit declaration of abolition in the law itself.
[73]
 For where a statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempt to interpret. 
Verba legis non est recedendum, index animi sermo est
. There should be no departure from the words of the statute, for speech is the index of intention.
[74]
 The legislature, through Sections 4 and 85 of R.A. No. 9497, has so clearly provided. As the Court merely interprets the law as it is, we have no discretion to give statutes a meaning detached from the manifest intendment and language thereof.
[75]
It is worth mentioning that this is not the first time for this Court to rule regarding the abolition of the ATO and the emergence of the CAAP by virtue of R.A. No. 9497. Holding that the CAAP, as the legal successor of the ATO, is liable to respondents therein for obligations incurred by ATO, this Court in 
Air Transportation Office v. Ramos
,
[76]
 in no uncertain terms, held that the ATO was abolished by virtue of Sections 4 and 85 of R.A. No. 9497.
Thus, we find petitionerâs assertion that the real intention of R.A. No. 9497 was merely the reorganization of the ATO and not its abolition devoid of merit.
Correlatively, we resolve the second issue in the negative.
For the ATO employeesâ security of tenure to be impaired, the abolition of the ATO must be done in bad faith.
At this juncture, our ruling in 
Kapisanan ng mga Kawani ng Energy Regulatory Board v. Barin
[77]
 is instructive, to wit:
A valid order of abolition must not only come from a legitimate body, it must also be made in good faith. An abolition is made in good faith when it is not made for political or personal reasons, or when it does not circumvent the constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees. Abolition of an office may be brought about by reasons of economy, or to remove redundancy of functions, or a clear and explicit constitutional mandate for such termination of employment
. Where one office is abolished and replaced with another office vested with similar functions, the abolition is a legal nullity. When there is a void abolition, the incumbent is deemed to have never ceased holding office.
We have also held that, other than the aforestated reasons of economy, making the bureaucracy more efficient is also indicative of the exercise of good faith in, and a valid purpose for, the abolition of an office.
[78]
The purpose for the abolition of the ATO is clearly manifested in Section 2 of R.A. No. 9497:
SEC. 2. 
Declaration of Policy.
 â It is hereby declared the policy of the State 
to provide safe and efficient air transport and regulatory services in the Philippines
 by providing for the creation of a civil aviation authority with jurisdiction over the restructuring of the civil aviation system, the promotion, development and regulation of the technical, operational, safety, and aviation security functions under the civil aviation authority. (Emphasis supplied)
It cannot be disregarded that in January 2008, before the enactment of R.A. No. 9497, the Philippines was again downgraded by the FAA to a Category 2 status because of air safety regulations, practices and personnel which fell below the ICAOâs standards. Hence, it is but reasonable to state that the purpose for the abolition of the ATO, as posited by petitioner itself, was â
to create a much more effective Agency in order to address the problems that go along with the fast emerging developments in the field of the globally-competitive aviation industry.
â
[79]
On the other hand, circumstances evidencing bad faith are enumerated in Section 2 of R.A. No. 6656 which provides:
SEC. 2. No officer or employee in the career service shall be removed except for a valid cause and after due notice and hearing. A valid cause for removal exists when, pursuant to a
 bona fide
 reorganization, a position has been abolished or rendered redundant or there is a need to merge, divide, or consolidate positions in order to meet the exigencies of the service, or other lawful causes allowed by the Civil Service Law. 
The existence of any or some of the following circumstances may be considered as evidence of bad faith in the removals made as a result of reorganization, giving rise to a claim for reinstatement or reappointment by an aggrieved party:
 
 
(a) 
 
Where there is a significant increase in the number of positions in the new staffing pattern of the department or agency concerned;
 
 
 
(b)
 
 
Where an office is abolished and another performing substantially the same functions is created;
 
 
 
(c)
 
 
Where incumbents are replaced by those less qualified in terms of status of appointment, performance and merit;
 
 
 
(d) 
 
Where there is a reclassification of offices in the department or agency concerned and the reclassified offices perform substantially the same functions as the original offices;
 
 
 
(e) 
 
Where the removal violates the order of separation provided in Section 3 hereof. (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
Petitioner posits that abolition of an office cannot have the effect of removing an officer holding it if the office is restored under another name. However, we find no bad faith in the abolition of the ATO as the latter was not simply restored in another name in the person of the CAAP. Thus, we compare the ATO and the CAAP.
ATO was merely a sectoral office of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and as such acted within the supervision of the latter and budgeted under it. As Section 2 of E.O. No. 125-A, series of 1987 deleted Section 12
[80]
 of E.O. No. 125, series of 1987 which delineated the functions of the former BAT, we rely on R.A. No. 776 in citing the functions of the CAA which were succeeded by the ATO through the powers and duties of the CAA Administrator. Section 32 of R.A. No. 776 provides:
SEC. 32. 
Powers and duties of the Administrator.
 â Subject to the general control and supervision of the Department Head, the Administrator shall have among others, the following powers and duties:
(1) To carry out the purposes and policies established in this Act; to enforce the provisions of, the rules and regulations issued in pursuance to, said Act; and he shall primarily be vested with authority to take charge of the technical and operational phase of civil aviation matters.
(2) To designate and establish civil airways, and to acquire, control, operate and maintain along such airways, air navigation facilities and to chart such airways and arrange for their publication including the aeronautical charts or maps required by the international aeronautical agencies by utilizing the equipment, supplies or assistance of existing agencies of the government as far as practicable.
(3) To issue airmanâs certificate specifying the capacity in which the holder thereof is authorized to serve as airman in connection with aircraft and shall be issued only upon the finding that the applicant is properly qualified and physically able to perform the duties of the position. The certificate shall contain such terms, conditions and limitations as the Administrator may determine to be necessary to assure safety in air commerce:

On the other hand, the CAAP is an independent regulatory body with quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative powers and possessing corporate attributes,
[81]
 having an authorized capital stock of fifty billion pesos (P50,000,000,000.00) which shall be fully subscribed by the Republic of the Philippines.
[82]
 It is attached to the DOTC only for the purpose of policy coordination.
[83]
 While the Director General is responsible for the exercise of all powers and the discharge of all duties including the control over all personnel and activities of the CAAP,
[84]
 the latterâs corporate powers are vested in its Board of Directors.
[85]
 It enjoys fiscal autonomy to fund its operations.
[86]
 With quasi-judicial powers, the Director General has the power and authority to inspect aviation equipment and also from time to time, for any reason, re-inspect or reexamine the same.
[87]
 If, as a result of any such re-inspection or reexamination, or if, as a result of any other investigation made by the Director General, he determines that safety in civil aviation or commercial air transport and the public interest requires, the Director General may issue an order amending, modifying, suspending or revoking, in whole or in part, any airworthiness certificate, airman certificate, air operator certificate or certificate for any airport, school, or approved maintenance organization.
[88]
 Possessing quasi-legislative powers, CAAPâs Board may authorize the Director General to issue or amend rules of procedures and practice as may be required, or issue and adopt rules and regulations and other issuances of the ICAO.
[89]
 Vested with corporate attributes, said Board, through a resolution, may empower the Director General to enter into, make and execute contracts of any kind with any person, firm, or public or private corporation.
[90]
Moreover, notable under R.A. No. 9497 is the establishment of permanent offices like the (a) Air Traffic Service; (b) Air Navigation Service; (c) Aerodrome Development and Management Service; (d) Administrative and Finance Service;
[91]
 (e) the Office of Enforcement and Legal Service;
[92]
 and (f) the Flight Standards Inspectorate Service.
[93]
 The law also mandated the Director General to organize the Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board.
[94]
Furthermore, R.A. No. 9497 manifested the adherence of the country to, and the adoption of, the Chicago Convention and ICAO standards
[95]
 and other international conventions
[96]
 with respect to matters relating to civil aviation.
After comparing the features and functions of the ATO and the CAAP, we find that CAAP indeed assumed the functions of the ATO. However, the overlap in their functions does not mean there was no valid abolition of the ATO.
[97]
  The CAAP has new and expanded features and functions which are intended to meet the growing needs of a globally competitive civil aviation industry, adherent to internationally recognized standards. Thus, in 
National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration v. Civil Service Commission
,
[98]
 we held that:
if the newly created office has substantially new, different or additional functions, duties or powers, so that it may be said in fact to create an office different from the one abolished, even though it embraces all or some of the duties of the old office it will be considered as an abolition of one office and the creation of a new or different one. The same is true if one office is abolished and its duties, for reasons of economy are given to an existing officer or office.
To be precise, the case before us deals only with the issue of abolition and not removal. Besides, petitioner has failed to provide in detail any ATO personnel who had been removed from office on account of R.A. No. 9497.
Apropos
 then is our ruling in
 Kapisanan ng mga Kawani ng Energy Regulatory Board v. Barin,
[99]
 to wit:
However, abolition of an office and its related positions is different from removal of an incumbent from his office. 
Abolition and removal are mutually exclusive concepts. From a legal standpoint, there is no occupant in an abolished office. Where there is no occupant, there is no tenure to speak of. Thus, impairment of the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure does not arise in the abolition of an office.
 On the other hand, removal implies that the office and its related positions subsist and that the occupants are merely separated from their positions.
Based on the premise that there was a valid abolition of ATO, in the absence of any bad faith, we rule that the ATO employeesâ right to security of tenure was not violated.
The Court cannot agree to petitionerâs supposition that there should be automatic absorption of all ATO employees to the CAAP. Indeed, there is no such thing as a vested interest in a public office, let alone an absolute right to hold it. Except constitutional offices which provide for special immunity as regards salary and tenure, no one can be said to have any vested right in an office or its salary.
[100]
 Public office is not property but a âpublic trust or agency.â While their right to due process may be relied upon by public officials to protect their security of tenure which, in a limited sense, is analogous to property,
[101]
 such fundamental right to security of tenure cannot be invoked against a valid abolition of office effected by the legislature itself.
However, it bears stressing that former ATO employees are not left without succor. Aside from the retirement packages provided for by R.A. No. 9497, the same law mandates that former qualified ATO employees should be accorded preference in filling up CAAP plantilla positions. Section 12 of R.A. No. 9497 provides:
SEC. 12. 
Personnel.
 â Qualified existing personnel of the Air Transportation Office (ATO) shall be given preference in the filling up of plantilla positions created in the Authority, subject to existing civil service rules and regulations.
This preference is resonated in Section 59(b), Rule IX of the IRR, which provides:
SECTION 59. 
Abolition of the Air Transportation Office
.
x x x x
 Qualified Air Transportation Office (ATO) personnel shall be given preference in the filling-up of CAAP plantilla positions subject to existing civil service rules and regulations.
Inasmuch as we accorded respect to the mandate of the law in abolishing the ATO, such preference in favor of qualified ATO employees, subject to existing civil service rules and regulations, should likewise be strictly heeded in favor of the said employees. All respondents must abide by this directive. No less than R.A. No. 9497 requires it.
Finally, we resolve the third issue in the negative.
A petition for prohibition will prosper only if grave abuse of discretion is manifested. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave. The term grave abuse of discretion is defined as a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner because of passion or hostility.
[102]
We hold that there is no grave abuse of discretion when Section 60 of the IRR provided for a âhold-overâ status on the part of ATO employees.
A careful perusal of Section 86 of R.A. No. 9497 reveals that the transfer of ATO personnel, unless they opted to retire from the service, to the CAAP implies the application of the hold-over principle. There being no express, much less implied prohibition of the application of the hold-over principle in R.A. No. 9497 
per se
, such proviso in the latterâs IRR does not amount to grave abuse of discretion.
In 
Lecaroz v. Sandiganbayan
,
[103]
 we held:
Absent an express or implied constitutional or statutory provision to the contrary, an officer is entitled to stay in office until his successor is appointed or chosen and has qualified. 
The legislative intent of not allowing holdover must be clearly expressed or at least implied in the legislative enactment, otherwise it is reasonable to assume that the law-making body favors the same
.
The reason for the application of the hold-over principle is clearly stated also in 
Lecaroz
,
[104]
 to wit:
Indeed, 
the law abhors a vacuum in public offices
, and courts generally indulge in the strong presumption against a legislative intent to create, by statute, a condition which may result in an executive or administrative office becoming, for any period of time, wholly vacant or unoccupied by one lawfully authorized to exercise its functions. 
This is founded on obvious considerations of public policy, for the principle of holdover is specifically intended to prevent public convenience from suffering because of a vacancy and to avoid a hiatus in the performance of government functions
.
Indeed, the application of the hold-over principle preserves continuity in the transaction of official business and prevents a hiatus in government. Thus, cases of extreme necessity justify the application of the hold-over principle.
[105]
Petitioner itself states and this Court, without doubt, agrees that the CAAP is an agency highly imbued with public interest. It is of rational inference that a hiatus therein would be disastrous not only to the economy, tourism and trade of the country but more so on the safety and security of aircraft passengers, may they be Filipino citizens or foreign nationals.
A final note.
On April 9, 2014, based on a March 2014 FAA review of the CAAP, the FAA opined that the Republic of the Philippines complies with the international safety standards set by the ICAO and has been granted a Category 1 rating.
[106]
 The European Union also lifted the ban on Philippine carriers.
[107]
 Thus, it cannot be ignored that the creation of the CAAP through R.A. No. 9497, in one way or another, helped in upgrading the countryâs status in the arena of civil aviation. Absent any violation of the Constitution and the other pertinent laws, rules and regulations, this Court would not hinder in the continuous growth and improvement of the civil aviation industry of the country.

 The FAA has established two ratings for the status of countries at the time of the assessment: does comply with ICAO standards, and does not comply with ICAO standards.
They are defined as follows:
Category 1, Does Comply with ICAO Standards:
 A countryâs civil aviation authority has been assessed by FAA inspectors and has been found to license and oversee air carriers in accordance with ICAO aviation safety standards.
Category 2, Does Not Comply with ICAO Standards:
 The Federal Aviation Administration assessed this countryâs civil aviation authority (CAA) and determined that it does not provide safety oversight of its air carrier operators in accordance with the minimum safety oversight standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
This rating is applied if one or more of the following deficiencies are identified:
the country lacks laws or regulations necessary to support the certification and oversight of air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards;
the CAA lacks the technical expertise, resources, and organization to license or oversee air carrier operations; 
the CAA does not have adequately trained and qualified technical personnel; 
the CAA does not provide adequate inspector guidance to ensure enforcement of, and compliance with, minimum international standards; and 
the CAA has insufficient documentation and records of certification and inadequate continuing oversight and surveillance of air carrier operations.
