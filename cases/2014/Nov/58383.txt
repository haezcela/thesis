MICHELIN ASIA APPLICATION CENTER, INC., VS. MARIO J. ORTIZ, PACIFIC SUPPORT PETITIONER, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 are the Decision
[2]
 dated June 2, 2009 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated September 29, 2009 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 106570 which annulled and set aside the Resolutions dated March 24, 2008,
[4]
 June 24, 2008,
[5]
 and September 22, 2008
[6]
 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR LAC No. 01-000455-08 dismissing respondent Mario J. Ortiz's (Ortiz) appeal due to several procedural errors.
The Facts
On March 1, 2003, Ortiz was employed by petitioner Michelin Asia Pacific Application Support Center, Inc. (Michelin ASC) as Personnel Manager and was thereby involved in the processes of recruitment, probation and employee contract monitoring, medical claims, and payroll, among others.
[7]
In line with the Michelin Group's "Tonus" initiative, which is a program for improving working methods, increasing efficiency, and reducing fixed costs across all of its affiliates, functions, and departments globally,
[8]
 a formal review of the Service Personnel processes at Michelin ASC was conducted and results therefrom determined that the functions of the Personnel Manager could be absorbed by the Service Center/Site Manager and/or Assistant Personnel Manager.
[9]
Thus, on November 30, 2006, Michelin ASC sent Ortiz a letter
[10]
 informing him of the termination of his employment effective the close of business on December 31, 2006 on the ground of redundancy.
[11]
 It also notified the Department of Labor and Employment - Regional Office about Ortiz's intended termination and submitted an Establishment Termination Report.
[12]
On December 6, 2006, Ortiz accepted a separation package in the amount of P2,225,561.66
[13]
 and executed a Release, Waiver and Quitclaim
[14]
 (quitclaim) in favor of Michelin ASC. Respondent also signed a Final Pay Computation evidencing payment of the said amount.
[15]
This notwithstanding, Ortiz, on February 27, 2007, filed a complaint
[16]
 for illegal dismissal against Michelin ASC,
[17]
 docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-02-01810-07, claiming, among others, that: (a) he was not aware that Michelin ASC had an impending redundancy program; (b) he was promised a separation package in the amount of 2.5 months' salary for every year of service; and (c) he, was, however, offered a lesser package upon his termination but was forced to accept the same since he had a family to support and was then 53 years old.
[18]
The LA Ruling
In a Decision
[19]
 dated November 27, 2007, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the illegal dismissal complaint, holding that Michelin ASC complied with the statutory requirements of a valid redundancy program and that the same was conducted in good faith.
[20]
 In this relation, the LA pointed out that Ortiz executed a quitclaim in favor of Michelin ASC and had received the total of P2,225,561.66, which amount was more than what the law provides as separation pay.
[21]
 Furthermore, the LA did not sustain Ortiz's claim regarding the separation package amounting to 2.5 months' salary for every year of service, considering the Affidavit
[22]
  executed by Michelin ASC's Senior Legal Counsel, Angeline Khoo, denying the same.
[23]
 Unconvinced, Ortiz appealed before the NLRC.
[24]
The Proceedings Before the NLRC
In a Resolution
[25]
 dated March 24, 2008, the NLRC dismissed Ortiz's appeal for not having been duly perfected, observing that his 
Memorandum of Appeal was 
not accompanied by a certificate of non-forum shopping
 in violation of Section 4
,
[26]
 
Rule VI of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC
[27]
 (NLRC Rules).
Ortiz moved for reconsideration
[28]
 but was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution
[29]
 dated June 24, 2008, considering that his motion was filed out of time. In particular, the NLRC observed that Ortiz himself admitted that he received a copy of the resolution sought to be reconsidered on April 14, 2008. However, 
his motion for reconsideration was only filed on May 7, 2008
, hence, 
beyond the 10-day reglementary period to perfect the same
, in violation of the mandatory requirement under Section 15,
[30]
 Rule VII of the NLRC Rules.
Dissatisfied, Ortiz filed a 
second motion for reconsideration
[31]
 on July 14, 2008, to which Michelin ASC was required to comment.
[32]
In a Resolution
[33]
 dated September 22, 2008, the NLRC did not give due course to the 
second motion for reconsideration
 for being in violation also of Section 15
,
[34]
 
Rule VII of the NLRC Rules
, or the prohibition against second motions for reconsideration.
The Proceedings Before the CA
Undeterred, Ortiz, on December 12, 2008, filed a petition for 
certiorari
[35]
 before the CA assailing the LA Decision and the NLRC's March 24, 2008, June 24, 2008, and September 22, 2008 Resolutions.
In a Resolution
[36]
 dated December 19, 2008, the CA dismissed Ortiz's petition for having been 
filed out of time
, remarking that a second motion for reconsideration before the NLRC was not allowed. The CA also dismissed the petition on the ground that 
a relevant pleading was not attached to it
, 
i.e
., Ortiz's reply.
Ortiz filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated January 9, 2009,
[37]
 to which Michelin ASC was required to comment.
[38]
In a Decision
[39]
 dated June 2, 2009, the CA reversed its earlier December 19, 2008 Resolution, and annulled the NLRC's March 24, 2008, June 24, 2008, and September 22, 2008 Resolutions, thus directing the NLRC to give due course to Ortiz's appeal. Mainly, the CA ruled that there was 
prima facie 
merit in Ortiz's contention and found it fitting to relax the procedural rules.
[40]
Aggrieved, Michelin ASC moved for reconsideration
[41]
 but was denied in a Resolution
[42]
 dated September 29, 2008, hence, the instant petition.
The Issue Before the Court
The essential issue before the Court is whether or not the CA properly granted Ortiz's petition for 
certiorari
 and annulled the NLRC Resolutions.
The Court's Ruling
The petition is meritorious.
To justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of 
certiorari
, petitioner must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon them. Grave abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a 
capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction
. To be considered "grave," the discretionary authority must be exercised 
in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be 
so patent and sross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law
.
[43]
After evaluating the relevant antecedents of this case, the Court comes to the conclusion that no grave abuse of discretion, in the sense above-described, was committed by the NLRC in dismissing Ortiz's appeal. As seen from the preceding factual narration, it is clear that the NLRC - in due observance of its own procedural rules - had amply justified its dismissal of Ortiz's appeal in view of his numerous procedural infractions, namely: (
a
) his failure to attach to his Memorandum of Appeal a certificate of non-forum shopping in violation of Section 4, Rule VI of the NLRC Rules;
[44]
 (
b
) his filing of a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC's March 24, 2008 Resolution beyond the 10 day reglementary period in violation of Section 15, Rule VII of the NLRC Rules;
[45]
 and (c) his filing of a second motion for reconsideration in violation of Section 15, Rule VII of the NLRC Rules.
[46]
Of significant consideration is Ortiz's violation of the mandatory requirement on the timely filing of a motion for reconsideration, which thus rendered the NLRC's initial March 24, 2008 Resolution 
final and executory
. 
Silva v. NLRC
[47]
 instructs:
Time and again, this Court has been emphatic in ruling that the seasonable filing of a motion for reconsideration within the 10-day reglementary period following the receipt by a party of any order, resolution or decision of the NLRC, is a 
mandatory requirement
 to forestall 
the finality
 of such order, resolution or decision. The statutory base for this is found in Article 223
[48]
 of the Labor Code and Section 14, Rule VII
[49]
 of the New Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission.
[50]
 (Emphases supplied)
"A definitive final judgment [- such as the NLRC's March 24, 2008 Resolution -] however erroneous, is no longer subject to change or revision."
[51]
 Settled is the rule that "
[a] decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable
. This quality of immutability precludes the modification of a final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law."
[52]
Hence, by the foregoing consideration alone, the CA should have dismissed Ortiz's 
certiorari
 petition. But this is not all.
To compound his mistakes, Ortiz even filed a 
second motion for reconsideration
, which is a prohibited pleading under the NLRC Rules. As a prohibited pleading, the filing of said motion 
could not have tolled the running of the 60-day reglementary period for the filing of a petition for 
certiorari
 
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA. Thus, since the NLRC's June 24, 2008 Resolution assailed by Ortiz's second motion for reconsideration was received by him on July 8, 2008,
[53]
 while his petition for certiorari before the CA was filed 
more than 60 days thereafter
, or on December 12, 2008,
[54]
 his 
certiorari 
petition should have been dismissed outright for having been filed out of time.
Therefore, for all these reasons, the Court reverses the CA Decision and reinstates the NLRC Resolutions dismissing Ortiz's appeal. Accordingly, it is now unnecessary to delve on the other ancillary issues raised in the petition of Michelin ASC.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
GRANTED
. The Decision dated June 2, 2009 and the Resolution dated September 29, 2009 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 106570 are hereby
