COSMOS BOTTLING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION EN BANC OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AND JUSTINA F. CALLANGAN, IN HER CAPACITY AS DIRECTOR OF THE CORPORATION FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE SEC, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




DEL CASTILLO, J.:


Assailed in this petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 are the Decision
[2]
 dated April 25, 2011 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated October 17, 2011 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 110714 affirming the Decision
[4]
 dated September 10, 2009 of respondent the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
En Banc
 in SEC 
En Banc
 Case No. 04-08-129 which dismissed petitioner Cosmos Bottling Corporationâs (Cosmos) appeal on the ground that it was treated as a prohibited motion for reconsideration. Thus, the Order of Revocation
[5]
 (Revocation Order) dated March 19, 2008 of the SEC-Corporation Finance Department (SEC-CFD) revoking Cosmosâs Registration of Securities/Permit to Sell Securities to the Public (Subject Registration/Permit) was deemed to have lapsed into finality.
The Facts
The instant case stemmed from Cosmosâs failure to submit its 2005 Annual Report to the SEC within the prescribed period. In connection therewith, it requested an extension of time within which to file the same.
[6]
 In response, the SEC-CFD, through respondent Director Justina F. Callangan (Director Callangan), sent Cosmos a letter
[7]
 dated May 18, 2006 denying the latterâs request and directing it to submit its 2005 Annual Report. The same letter also ordered Cosmos to show cause why the Subject Registration/Permit should not be revoked for violating Section 17.1(a)
[8]
 of Republic Act No. 8799, otherwise known as âThe Securities Regulation Codeâ (SRC).
[9]
On May 31, 2006, Cosmos sent a reply-letter
[10]
 to the SEC-CFD, explaining that its failure to file its 2005 Annual Report was due to the non-completion by its external auditors of their audit procedures. For this reason, Cosmos implored the SEC-CFD to reconsider its previous denial of Cosmosâs request for additional time to file its 2005 Annual Report.
[11]
 Thereafter, hearings for the suspension of the Subject Registration/Permit commenced, with Cosmos advancing the same reasons for the non-submission of its 2005 Annual Report in its May 31, 2006 letter to the SEC-CFD.
[12]
The SEC-CFD Proceedings
In an Order
[13]
 dated May 8, 2007, the SEC-CFD ordered the suspension of the Subject Registration/Permit(suspension order)for a period of 60 days from receipt of the same, or until Cosmos files its 2005 Annual Report, whichever is earlier. The SEC-CFD also stated that Cosmosâs failure to submit its 2005 Annual Report within the 60-day period shall constrain the SEC to initiate proceedings for revocation of the Subject Registration/Permit.
[14]
After the lapse of the aforesaid period, Cosmos still failed to comply with the SECâs directives. Thus, the revocation proceedings commenced on August 22, 2007.
[15]
 On August 24, 2007, Cosmos submitted its formal explanation,
[16]
 reiterating that the delay in submitting its 2005 Annual Report, as well as its 2006 Annual Report, is occasioned by the following factors: (
a
) non-completion of its 2005 Audited Financial Statements by its external auditor; (
b
) the adoption of new accounting standards which gave rise to additional disclosures in the financial reports; and (
c
) the sale of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., which is the parent company of Cosmos, to Coca-Cola South Asia Holdings, Inc.
[17]
 These notwithstanding, Cosmos undertook to submit its 2005 and 2006 Annual Reports not later than October 31, 2007, or as soon as they are duly accomplished, and to pay all the corresponding penalties. Lastly, Cosmos also requested the SEC-CFD to abandon the pending revocation proceedings.
[18]
On October 31, 2007, Cosmos finally submitted its 2005 and 2006 Annual Reports to the SEC.
[19]
 In connection therewith, Cosmos sent a letter
[20]
 dated January 24, 2008 to the SEC-CFD, requesting that the latter lift the suspension order and abandon the revocation proceedings against the former. 
[21]
 The SEC-CFD referred the matter to the SEC 
En Banc
 for its consideration in its March 13, 2008 meeting.
[22]
 After the said meeting, the SEC En Banc issued Resolution No. 87, series of (s.) 2008
[23]
 wherein they resolved to: (
a
) deny Cosmosâs request for the lifting of the suspension order; and (
b
) revoke the Subject Registration/Permit.
[24]
 On the basis thereof, the SEC-CFD issued a Revocation Order echoing the pronouncements indicated in the aforesaid resolution.
Dissatisfied, Cosmos appealed to the SEC 
En Banc.
[25]
The SEC 
En Banc
 Ruling
In a Decision
[26]
 dated September 10, 2009, the SEC 
En Banc
 dismissed Cosmosâs appeal.
[27]
 It held that the Revocation Order was a mere articulation of the SEC 
En Bancâ
s Resolution No. 87, s. 2008, and thus, should be considered an issuance of the SEC 
En Banc 
itself. The SEC 
En Banc 
thus deemed Cosmosâs appeal as a motion for reconsideration, a prohibited pleading under Section 3-6, Rule III of the 2006 SEC Rules of Procedure,
[28]
 and was accordingly expunged from the records of the case.
[29]
Aggrieved, Cosmos filed a petition for review before the CA.
[30]
The CA Ruling
In a Decision
[31]
 dated April 25, 2011, the CA affirmed the SEC 
En Banc
 Ruling. It held that the SEC-CFD merely acted as an arm of the SEC 
En Banc
 when it issued the Revocation Order against Cosmos, considering that it was simply a reiteration of Resolution No. 87, s. 2008 which emanated from the SEC 
En Banc
 itself. As such, Cosmosâs appeal before the SEC 
En Banc
 assailing the Revocation Order was properly deemed as a motion for reconsideration, since it is tantamount to a request for the SEC 
En Banc
 to review or reconsider its own judgment.
[32]
 Hence, the SEC 
En Banc 
correctly dismissed Cosmosâs appeal.
Further, the CA held that Cosmosâs appeal, which was treated as a prohibited motion for reconsideration under the 2006 SEC Rules of Procedure, did not toll the reglementary period for filing an appeal before it. As such, the SEC 
En Bancâs
 Ruling,as well as the Revocation Order, had already lapsed into finality and could no longer be disturbed.
[33]
Cosmos moved for reconsideration,
[34]
 which was, however, denied in a Resolution
[35]
 dated October 17, 2011, hence, this petition.
The Issue Before the Court
The primordial issue for the Courtâs resolution is whether or not the CA correctly treated Cosmosâs appeal before the SEC 
En Banc 
as a motion for reconsideration, and consequently, affirmed its dismissal for being a prohibited pleading under the 2006 SEC Rules of Procedure.
The Courtâs Ruling
The petition is meritorious.
As an administrative agency with both regulatory and adjudicatory functions,
[36]
 the SEC was given the authority to delegate some of its functions to, 
inter alia,
 its various operating departments, such as the SEC-CFD, the Enforcement and Investor Protection Department, and the Company Registration and Monitoring Department, pursuant to Section 4.6 of the SRC, to wit:
SEC. 4. 
Administrative Agency.
x x x x
 
 
4.6.
 
The 
Commission may, for purposes of efficiency, delegate any of its functions to any department
 or office of the Commission, an individual Commissioner or staff member of the Commission except its review or appellate authority and its power to adopt, alter and supplement any rule or regulation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Commission may review upon its own initiative or upon the petition of any interested party any action of any department or office, individual Commissioner, or staff member or the Commission. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
 
 
Naturally, the aforesaid provision also gives the SEC the power to review the acts performed by its operating departments in the exercise of the formerâs delegated functions. This power of review is squarely addressed by Section 11-1, Rule XI of the 2006 SEC Rules of Procedure, which provides that â[a]n appeal to the Commission 
En Banc 
may be taken from a decision, order, or resolution issued by an Operating Department if there are questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.â
In this case, the Court disagrees with the findings of both the SEC 
En Banc
 and the CA that the Revocation Order emanated from the SEC 
En Banc.
 Rather, such Order was merely issued by the SEC-CFD as one of the SECâs operating departments, as evidenced by the following: (a) it was printed and issued on the letterhead of the SEC-CFD, and not the SEC 
En Banc
; (b) it was docketed as a case under the SEC-CFD as an operating department of the SEC, since it bore the serial number âSEC-CFD Order No. 027, [s.] 2008;â and (c) it was signed solely by Director Callangan as director of the SEC-CFD, and not by the commissioners of the SEC 
En Banc.
Further, both the SEC 
En Banc
 and the CA erred in holding that the Revocation Order merely reflected Resolution No. 87, s. 2008, and thus, should already be considered as the ruling of the SEC
 En Banc
 in this case. As admitted by respondents, the SEC-CFDâs referral of the case to the SEC 
En Banc
 for its consideration in its March 13, 2008 meeting, which eventually resulted in the issuance of Resolution No. 87, s. 2008, was merely an internal procedure inherent in the exercise by the SEC of its administrative and regulatory functions.
[37]
 Moreover, Cosmos never knew of the existence of Resolution No. 87, s. 2008, as it was not furnished a copy thereof; nor did the Revocation Order make any specific reference to the same. Essentially, Cosmos was only apprised of the existence of Resolution No. 87, s. 2008 when it was finally cited by the SEC 
En Banc
 in its September 10, 2009 Decision.
[38]
 Accordingly, when Cosmos received the Revocation Order, it had every reason to believe that it was issued by the SEC-CFD as an Operating Department of the SEC, and thus, appealable to the SEC 
En Banc
. Therefore, the outright dismissal of Cosmosâs appeal by the SEC 
En Banc
 effectively denied it of its right to appeal, as provided for under the SRC and the 2006 SEC Rules of Procedure, and therefore could not be countenanced.
In sum, the Revocation Order is properly deemed as a decision issued by the SEC-CFD as one of the Operating Departments of the SEC, and accordingly, may be appealed to the SEC 
En Banc,
 as what Cosmos properly did in this case. Perforce, the SEC 
En Banc
 and the CA erred in deeming Cosmosâs appeal as a motion for reconsideration and ordering its dismissal on such ground. In view thereof, the Court deems it prudent to reinstate and remand the case to the SEC 
En Banc
 for its resolution on the merits.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
GRANTED
. Accordingly, the Decision dated April 25, 2011 and the Resolution dated October 17, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 110714 are hereby 
SET ASIDE.
 The instant case is 
REMANDED 
to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
En Banc
 for resolution of Cosmos Bottling Corporationâs appeal on the merits.
