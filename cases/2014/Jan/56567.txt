VILLARAMA, JR., J.:


Before the Court are: (1) the
 Joint Motion and Manifestation
 dated October 1, 2013 filed in 
G.R. Nos. 196171 & 199238
 by RCBC Capital Corporation (âRCBC Capitalâ), BDO Unibank, Inc. (âBDOâ), and George L. Go, in his personal capacity and as attorney-in-fact of the individual stockholders as listed in the Share Purchase Agreement dated May 27, 2000 (âGo/Shareholdersâ), thru their respective counsels; and (2) the 
Joint Motion and Manifestation
 dated October 1, 2013 filed in 
G.R. No. 200213
 by BDO and RCBC Capital thru their respective counsel.
All three petitions emanated from arbitration proceedings commenced by RCBC Capital pursuant to the arbitration clause under its Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with EPCIB involving the latterâs shares in Bankard, Inc.   In the course of arbitration conducted by the Tribunal constituted and administered by the International Chamber of Commerce-International Commercial Arbitration (ICC-ICA), EPCIB was merged with BDO which assumed all its liabilities and obligations.
G.R. No. 196171 is a petition for review under 
Rule 45
 seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision dated December 23, 2010 in CA-G.R. SP No. 113525 which reversed and set aside the June 24, 2009 Order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 148 in SP Proc. Case No. M-6046.  The RTC confirmed the Second Partial Award issued by the Arbitration Tribunal ordering BDO to pay RCBC Capital proportionate share in the advance costs and dismissing BDOâs counterclaims.
G.R. No. 199238 is a petition for certiorari under 
Rule 65
 assailing the September 13, 2011 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 120888 which denied BDOâs application for the issuance of a stay order and/or temporary restraining order (TRO)/preliminary injunction against the RTC of Makati City, Branch 148 in Sp. Proc. Case No. M-6046.  Acting upon RCBC Capitalâs urgent motion, the RTC issued on August 22, 2011 a writ of execution for the implementation of the courtâs order confirming the Final Award rendered by the Arbitration Tribunal on June 16, 2010.
On the other hand, G.R. No. 200213, filed on February 6, 2012, is a petition for review under 
Rule 45
 praying for the reversal of the CAâs Decision dated February 24, 2011 and Resolution dated January 13, 2012 in CA-G.R. SP No. 113402.  The CA denied BDOâs petition for certiorari and prohibition with application for issuance of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction against the RTC of Makati City, Branch 148 in Sp. Proc. Case No. M-6046.    By Order dated June 24, 2009, the RTC denied BDOâs motion for access of the computerized accounting system of Bankard, Inc. after Chairman Richard Ian Barker had denied BDOâs request that it be given access to the said source of facts or data used in preparing the accounting summaries submitted in evidence before the Arbitration Tribunal.
G.R. Nos. 196171 & 199238 were consolidated and a Decision was rendered by this Court on December 10, 2012, the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition in G.R. No. 199238 is DENIED.  The Resolution dated September 13, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 120888 is AFFIRMED.
The petition in G.R. No. 196171 is DENIED.  The Decision dated December 23, 2010 of the Court of  Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 113525 is hereby AFFIRMED.
