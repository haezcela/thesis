COSMOS BOTTLING CORP., PETITIONER, VS. WILSON FERMIN, RESPONDENT. 
[G.R. NO. 194303]
 WILSON B. FERMIN, PETITIONER, VS. COSMOS BOTTLING CORPORATION AND CECILIA BAUTISTA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




SERENO, J.:


Before this Court are two consolidated cases, namely: (1) Petition for Review dated 26 October 2010 (G.R. No. 193676) and (2) Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 dated 14 October 2010 (G.R. No. 194303).
[1]
 Both Petitions assail the Decision dated 20 May 2009
[2]
 and Resolution dated 8 September 2010
[3]
 issued by the Court of Appeals (CA). The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, the August 31, 2005 
Decision 
and October 21, 2005 
Resolution
 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC NCR CA No. 043301-05 are hereby 
SET ASIDE
. Respondent Cosmos Bottling Corporation is, in light of the foregoing discussions, hereby 
ORDERED
 to pay Petitioner his full retirement benefits.
There being no data from which this Court can properly assess Petitionerâs full retirement benefits, the case is, thus, remanded to the Labor Arbiter only for that purpose.
SO ORDERED.
Wilson B. Fermin (Fermin) was a forklift operator at Cosmos Bottling Corporation (COSMOS), where he started his employment on 27 August 1976.
[4]
 On 16 December 2002, he was accused of stealing the cellphone of his fellow employee, Luis Braga (Braga).
[5]
 Fermin was then given a Show Cause Memorandum, requiring him to explain why the cellphone was found inside his locker.
[6]
 In compliance therewith, he submitted an affidavit the following day, explaining that he only hid the phone as a practical joke and had every intention of returning it to Braga.
[7]
On 21 December 2002, Braga executed a handwritten narration of events stating the following:
[8]
 
 
(a)
 
At around 6:00 a.m. on 16 December 2002, he was changing his clothes inside the locker room, with Fermin as the only other person present. 
 
 
 
(b) 
 
Braga went out of the locker room and inadvertently left his cellphone by the chair. Fermin was left inside the room.
 
 
 
(c) 
 
After 10 minutes, Braga went back to the locker room to retrieve his cellphone, but it was already gone.
 
 
 
(d) 
 
Braga asked if Fermin saw the cellphone, but the latter denied noticing it.
 
 
 
(e)
 
 
Braga reported the incident to the security guard, who thereafter conducted an inspection of all the lockers.
 
 
 
(f)
 
 
The security guard found the cellphone inside Ferminâs locker.
 
 
 
(g) 
 
Later that afternoon, Fermin talked to Braga to ask for forgiveness. The latter pardoned the former and asked him not to do the same to their colleagues.
 
 
After conducting an investigation, COSMOS found Fermin guilty of stealing Bragaâs phone in violation of company rules and regulations.
[9]
 Consequently, on 2 October 2003,
[10]
 the company terminated Fermin from employment after 27 years of service,
[11]
 effective on 6 October 2003.
[12]
Following the dismissal of Fermin from employment, Braga executed an affidavit, which stated the belief that the former had merely pulled a prank without any intention of stealing the cellphone, and withdrew from COSMOS his complaint against Fermin.
[13]
Meanwhile, Fermin filed a Complaint for Illegal Dismissal,
[14]
 which the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed for lack of merit on the ground that the act of taking a fellow employeeâs cellphone amounted to gross misconduct.
[15]
 Further, the LA likewise took into consideration Ferminâs other infractions, namely: (a) committing acts of disrespect to a superior officer, and (b) sleeping on duty and abandonment of duty.
[16]
Fermin filed an appeal with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which affirmed the ruling of the LA
[17]
 and denied Ferminâs subsequent Motion for Reconsideration.
[18]
Thereafter, Fermin filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA),
[19]
 which reversed the rulings of the LA and the NLRC and awarded him his full retirement benefits.
[20]
 Although the CA accorded with finality the factual findings of the lower tribunals as regards Ferminâs commission of theft, it nevertheless held that the penalty of dismissal from service was improper on the ground that the said violation did not amount to serious misconduct or wilful disobedience, to wit:
[COSMOS], on which the onus of proving lawful cause in sustaining the dismissal of [Fermin] lies, failed to prove that the latterâs misconduct was induced by a perverse and wrongful intent, especially in the light of Bragaâs 
Sinumpaang Salaysay 
which corroborated [Ferminâs] claim that [Fermin] was merely playing a prank when he hid Bragaâs cellular phone. Parenthetically, the labor courts dismissed Bragaâs affidavit of desistance as a mere afterthought because the same was executed only after [Fermin] had been terminated.
It must be pointed out, however, that in labor cases, in which technical rules of procedure are not to be strictly applied if the result would be detrimental to the workingman, an affidavit of desistance gains added importance in the absence of any evidence on record explicitly showing that the dismissed employee committed the act which caused the dismissal. While We cannot completely exculpate [Fermin] from his violation at this point, We cannot, however, turn a blind eye and disregard Bragaâs recantation altogether. Bragaâs recantation all the more bolsters Our conclusion that [Ferminâs] violation does not amount to or borders on âserious or willfulâ misconduct or willful disobedience to call for his dismissal.
Morever, [COSMOS] failed to prove any resultant material damage or prejudice on their part as a consequence of [Ferminâs] questioned act. To begin with, the cellular phone subject of the stealth belonged, not to [COSMOS], but to Braga. Secondly, the said phone was returned to Braga in due time. Under the circumstances, a penalty such as suspension without pay would have sufficed to teach [Fermin] a lesson and for him to realize his wrongdoing.
x x x                            x x x                            x x x     
On another note, [COSMOS], in upholding the legality of [Ferminâs] termination from service, considered the latterâs past infractions with [COSMOS], i.e. threatening, provoking, challenging, insulting and committing acts of disrespect to a superior officer/defiance to an instruction and a lawful order of a superior officer; and, sleeping while on duty and abandonment of duty or leaving assigned post with permission from immediate supervisor, as 
aggravating circumstances
 to his present violation [stealth (sic) of a co-employeeâs property]. We 
disagree with Public Respondent on this matter.
The correct rule is that previous infractions may be used as justification for an employeeâs dismissal from work in connection with a subsequent 
similar
 offense, which is obviously 
not
 the case here. x x x. 
[21]
 (Emphases in the original.)
COSMOS and Fermin moved for reconsideration, but the CA likewise denied their motions.
[22]
 Thus, both parties filed the present Petitions for Review.
COSMOS argues, among other things, that: (a) Fermin committed a clear act of bad faith and dishonesty in taking the cellphone of Braga and denying knowledge thereof; (b) the latterâs recantation was a mere afterthought; (c) the lack of material damage or prejudice on the part of COSMOS does not preclude it from imposing the penalty of termination; and (d) the previous infractions committed by Fermin strengthen the decision of COSMOS to dismiss him from service.
[23]
On the other hand, Fermin contends that since the CA found that the penalty of dismissal was not proportionate to his offense, it should have ruled in favor of his entitlement to backwages.
[24]
It must be noted that in the case at bar, 
all the lower tribunals were in agreement that Ferminâs act of taking Bragaâs cellphone amounted to theft
. Factual findings made by administrative agencies, if established by substantial evidence as borne out by the records, are final and binding on this Court, whose jurisdiction is limited to reviewing questions of law.
[25]
 The only disputed issue left for resolution is whether the imposition of the penalty of dismissal was appropriate. We rule in the affirmative.
Theft committed against a co-employee is considered as a case analogous to serious misconduct, for which the penalty of dismissal from service may be meted out to the erring employee,
[26]
 
viz
:
Article 282 of the Labor Code provides:
Article 282. Termination by Employer. - An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:
(a) 
Serious misconduct 
or willful disobendience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or his representatives 
in connection with his work
;
x x x                            x x x                           x x x    
(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing.
Misconduct involves âthe transgression of some established and definite rule of action, forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment.â For misconduct to be serious and therefore a valid ground for dismissal, it must be:
1. of grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial or unimportant and
2. connected with the work of the employee.
In this case, petitioner dismissed respondent based on the NBI's finding that the latter stole and used Yusecoâs credit cards. But 
since the theft was not committed against petitioner itself but against one of its employees, respondent's misconduct was not work-related and therefore, she could not be dismissed for serious misconduct.
Nonetheless, Article 282(e) of the Labor Code talks of other analogous causes or those which are susceptible of comparison to another in general or in specific detail. For an employee to be validly dismissed for a cause analogous to those enumerated in Article 282, the cause must involve a voluntary and/or willful act or omission of the employee.
A cause analogous to serious misconduct is a voluntary and/or willful act or omission attesting to an employeeâs moral depravity. 
Theft committed by an employee against a person other than his employer, if proven by substantial evidence, is a cause analogous to serious misconduct
.
[27]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
In this case, the LA has already made a factual finding, which was affirmed by both the NLRC and the CA, that Fermin had committed theft when he took Bragaâs cellphone. Thus, this act is deemed analogous to serious misconduct, rendering Ferminâs dismissal from service just and valid.
Further, the CA was correct in ruling that previous infractions may be cited as justification for dismissing an employee only if they are related to the subsequent offense.
[28]
 However, it must be noted that such a discussion was unnecessary since the theft, taken in isolation from Ferminâs other violations, was in itself a valid cause for the termination of his employment.
Finally, it must be emphasized that the award of financial compensation or assistance to an employee validly dismissed from service has no basis in law. Therefore, considering that Ferminâs act of taking the cellphone of his co-employee is a case analogous to serious misconduct, this Court is constrained to reverse the CAâs ruling as regards the payment of his full retirement benefits. In the same breath, neither can this Court grant his prayer for backwages.
