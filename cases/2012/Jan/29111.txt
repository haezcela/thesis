RE: REPORT ON FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED AT MCTC, SANTIAGO-SAN ESTEBAN, ILOCOS SUR
D E C I S I O N




LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.:


The administrative case at bar arose from the judicial audit of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Santiago-San Esteban, Ilocos Sur.
The Court Management Office (CMO) of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) conducted a judicial audit and physical inventory of cases in said MCTC, in view of (1) the compulsory retirement of Angeles J. Ancheta (Ancheta), MCTC Clerk of Court II, on August 2, 2006; (2) the request made on August 6, 2008 by Febella J. Guillermo, Officer-in-Charge, Accounting Division, Finance Management Office, OCA, for an immediate audit of Virginia D. Hufana (Hufana), MCTC Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Clerk of Court II, from August 1, 2006 to June 30, 2008, for her failure to submit monthly reports;
[1]
 and (3) the Memorandum dated July 9, 2009 of then MCTC Acting Presiding Judge Juvencio S. Gascon and letter dated July 16, 2009 of then Executive Judge Isidro T. Pobre of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, requesting a comprehensive audit of the financial records of the MCTC considering the assumption to duty of Estella E. Imperial (Imperial) as MCTC Clerk of Court II on July 1, 2008.
On August 31, 2007, then Court Administrator Christopher O. Lock requested
[2]
 authority from the Court to withhold Hufanaâs salaries given her continuous failure to submit the required monthly report of collections, deposits, and withdrawals for the Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ), Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Fiduciary Fund, and Sheriffâs Trust Fund of the MCTC from August 2006 up to the time the request was made.  The request was approved on September 18, 2007.
After the examination of the books of accounts of the MCTC Clerks of Court II, namely, Ancheta (March 1985 to July 31, 2006), Hufana (August 1, 2006 to June 30, 2008) and Imperial (July 1, 2008 to May 31, 2010), the CMO-OCA Audit Team submitted its Memorandum

[6]
 
 
The Court issued a Resolution dated July 6, 2011 which noted the foregoing Report, re-docketed the case as a regular administrative matter, and issued a hold departure order against Ancheta and Hufana to prevent them from leaving the country.
The Court required Hufana and Ancheta to submit their explanation on the administrative charges against them.  However, up until the resolution of the instant administrative matter, Hufana and Ancheta have still not complied with said directive.
The Court has already given Hufana and Ancheta more than enough opportunity to explain their side.  With their obstinate defiance and incessant refusal to submit their compliance to this Court, despite the latterâs repeated directives and stern admonitions, Hufana and Ancheta displayed their insolence and disrespect for the lawful orders of the Court.  âA resolution of the Supreme Court should not be construed as a mere request, [and] should be complied with promptly and completely.â  Such âfailure to comply betrays not only a recalcitrant streak in character, but also a disrespect for the Courtâs lawful order and directive.â
[7]
  Furthermore, this contumacious conduct of refusing to abide by the lawful directives issued by the Court has likewise been considered as an utter lack of interest to remain with, if not contempt of, the system.
[8]
  Hufana and Anchetaâs transgression is highlighted even more by the fact that they are employees of the Judiciary, who, more than an ordinary citizen, should be aware of their duty to obey the orders and processes of the Supreme Court without delay.
[9]
  Their willful disobedience to and disregard for the directive of this Court constitute grave and serious misconduct,
[10]
 which cannot be tolerated.
The Court shall no longer wait for Ancheta and Hufana, who have clearly forfeited their chance to be heard on the charges against them.  It now proceeds to resolve this administrative matter based on the present contents of the record, the most significant of which are the report and recommendations of the CMO-OCA Audit Team and their annexes, as adopted by the OCA.
The Court has recognized that âClerk[s] of Court [are] important officer[s] in our judicial system.  [Their] office is the nucleus of all court activities, adjudicative and administrative.  [Their] administrative functions are as vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice as their judicial duties.â
[11]
The Court has further declared that the âClerk of Court performs a very delicate function [as] the custodians of the funds and revenues, records, property, and premises of the court[,]â and as such, âthey are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction, or impairment of said funds and property.â
[12]
Supreme Court Circulars No. 13-92 and No. 5-93 provide the guidelines for the proper administration of court funds.  Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92 mandates that all fiduciary collections âshall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized depository bank.â  In Supreme Court Circular No. 5-93, the Land Bank of the Philippines was designated as the authorized government depository.
In 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Fortaleza
,
[13]
 the Court expounded on the responsibility and accountability of Clerks of Court for the collected legal fees in their custody, thus:
Clerks of Court are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts; with regard to the collection of legal fees, they perform a delicate function as judicial officers entrusted with the correct and effective implementation of regulations thereon.  Even the undue delay in the remittances of amounts collected by them at the very least constitutes misfeasance.  On the other hand, a vital administrative function of a judge is the effective management of his court and this includes control of the conduct of the courtâs ministerial officers.  It should be brought home to both that the safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly administration of justice and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the Circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds.
[14]
The Court, in 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Galo
,
[15]
 pointed out that it had always reminded Clerks of Court that, as custodians of court funds and revenues, they have the âduty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories for [Clerks of Court] are not supposed to keep funds in their custody.â
[16]
Ancheta and Hufanaâs refusal to face head-on the charges against them is contrary to the principle that the first impulse of an innocent person, when accused of wrongdoing, is to express his/her innocence at the first opportune time.
[17]
  Ancheta and Hufanaâs silence and non-participation in the present administrative proceedings, despite due notice and directives of this Court for them to submit documents in their defense, i.e., a written explanation, an accounting, and missing receipts, strongly indicate their guilt.  Moreover, the â[f]ailure of a public officer to remit funds upon demand by an authorized officer [shall be]
 prima facie
 evidence that the public officer has put such missing funds or property to personal use.â
[18]
  In the total absence of rebutting or contrary evidence, then the Court can only conclude that Ancheta and Hufana have misappropriated the unaccounted/unremitted court funds in their care and custody.
Ancheta and Hufanaâs failure to remit their collections, amounting to P390,048.00 and P33,603.80, constitutes gross neglect of duty, dishonesty, and grave misconduct.
[19]
  They have transgressed the trust reposed in them as cashiers and disbursement officers of the Court.
[20]
We emphasized in 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Ganzan
[21]
 that:
The conduct or behavior of all court personnel is circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.  Time and again, the High Court affirms the practical reality that the image of the court as a true temple of justice is mirrored by the conduct of everyone who works therein, from the judge to the lowest clerk.  It is therefore imperative that those involved in the administration of justice must live up to the highest standard of honesty and integrity in the public service.
On court employees who have fallen short of their accountabilities, particularly, Clerks of Court who are the custodians of court funds and properties, the Court has not hesitated to impose the ultimate penalty.  This Court has never tolerated or condoned any conduct that would violate the norms of public accountability and diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the justice system.
[22]
However, since Ancheta and Hufana had already retired from the service, dismissal is no longer feasible as a penalty for the present charges.

, the Court finds respondent Angeles J. Ancheta, former Clerk of Court II, and Virginia T. Hufana, former OIC-Clerk of Court II, of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Santiago-San Esteban, Ilocos Sur,
