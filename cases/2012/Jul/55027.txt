PER CURIAM:


For our resolution are two consolidated cases, namely, ( 1) Administrative Complaint, docketed as A.M. No. P-11-2965 (OCA l.P.J. No. 08-3029-P), filed by the Commission on Audit (COA), represented by Atty. Francisco R. Velasco against respondent Arlene B. Aselre, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Ocampo, Camarines Sur, for malversation of public funds; and (2) Administrative Complaint, docketed as A.M. No. P-10-2752 (OCA I.P.I.

Commission on Audit, represented by Atty. Francisco R. Velasco v. Arlene B. Asetre, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Ocampo, Camarines Sur.
 
 
 
 
 
In an Indorsement dated December 3, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon referred to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action the complete records of CPL-L-08-2120 entitled â
COA v. Arlene B. Asetre
â relative to the charges of Malversation of Public Funds, Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service against Arlene B. Asetre, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Ocampo, Camarines Sur. The charges originated from the findings of the Audit Team of the Commission on Audit that respondent Asetre incurred cash shortage of One Hundred Fifty Thousand and Four Pesos (P150,004.00), representing unremitted cash collections from December 8, 2003 to November 13, 2009, to the prejudice of the government.
The shortage was accounted for as follows:

The COA report alleged that respondent did not remit/deposit her collections on time to the authorized depository bank, which resulted to the accumulation of the cash in her custody and that she even admitted that she utilized the collections for personal use. The delays incurred in remitting such collections ranged from one (1) day to 866 days.
On January 8, 2009, the OCA directed respondent to comment on the complaint against her.
Respondent admitted that she misappropriated the money for her personal gain due to her financial problems and begged the indulgence of the Court to allow her to restitute the shortages. She likewise pleaded for compassion and clemency, and in the alternative, she be allowed to retire with full benefits to be able to pay all her financial obligations.
In a Memorandum
[2]
 dated October 14, 2009, the OCA recommended that the resolution of the instant case be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the financial audit conducted by the Court Management Office of the OCA (CMO-OCA) in the MTC, Ocampo, Camarines Sur.
In a Resolution
[3]
 dated December 7, 2009, the Court resolved to hold in abeyance the resolution of the administrative case against respondent pending the outcome of the financial audit conducted in the MTC, Ocampo, Camarines Sur by the Fiscal Monitoring Division.

Re: Financial Audit Conducted in the Municipal Trial Court, Ocampo, Camarines Sur
.
 
 
 
 
Prompted by the audit findings made by the COA which showed shortages in the accountabilities of respondent Asetre, the CMO-OCA conducted a financial audit of the financial accounts of the MTC, Ocampo, Camarines Sur covering the accountability period of Clerk of Court Mrs. Arlene B. Asetre, from March 1, 2004 to July 16, 2009. While the COA examination covered only the period December 8, 2003 to November 13, 2006 and the CMO Audit Team covered the period March 1, 2004 to July 16, 2009, it appeared that the shortages for the period covered by the COA team on all funds were almost the same as that found by the Audit Team of the CMO.
Based on the available documents, the audit report yielded the following results:

The FMD Audit Team discovered that respondent incurred shortages on all legal fees collections of the court. Beginning March 2004 to December 2006, remittances/deposits were not remitted in full which resulted to the shortages uncovered. Respondentâs transgressions became very obvious when she failed to remit all her collections from January 2008 to July 2009. Below is the summary of her accountabilities.

From March 2004 onwards, respondent purposely failed to deposit material portion of her collections on JDF, SAJF, MF, VCF and FF for seemingly personal reason/s, thus, her total undeposited collections went up to Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty Pesos and 23/100 (P225,880.23) as against the cash on hand amounting to Four Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Eight Pesos and 25/100 Centavos (P4,648.25) which she presented during the cash count on July 16, 2009.
It was also discovered that monthly reports of collections, deposits and/or withdrawals on Judiciary Development Fund, Clerk of Court General Fund/Special Allowance for the Judiciary fund, Fiduciary Fund and Mediation Fund were not regularly submitted to the Accounting Division of the OCA.
In fact, due to respondent's failure to deposit the fiduciary fund collections to Land Bank of the Philippines Savings Account No. 00411282-67, it resulted to the account's closure due to bank charges and for failing to meet the required minimum balance.
Likewise, respondent did not collect Sheriff's Trust fund as mandated in Revised Rule 141, Rules of Court in Supreme Court Administrative Matter No. 04-2-04-SC effective August 16, 2004.
In a Resolution
[7]
 dated November 25, 2009, the Court resolved, among other things, to:
1. Direct the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to DOCKET the report of the Financial Audit Team as a regular administrative complaint against Mrs. Arelene B. Asetre for violation of the circulars and other issuances of the Court on the proper handling of Judiciary collections which has resulted in the shortages incurred on the different fund accounts of the Court, and consolidate the audit report with OCA IPI No. 08-3029-P; 
2. DIRECT Mrs. Arlene B. Asetre, Clerk of Court of the MTC of Ocampo, Camarines Sur to:

Calupit, designated collecting officer, to ensure strict adherence to circulars and other issuances of the Court regarding the proper handling of Judiciary funds.
[8]
In her letter dated January 25, 2010, respondent admitted all the allegations against her except her alleged failure to submit Monthly Reports of Collections, Deposits and/or Withdrawals on Judiciary Development Fund, which she claimed to have complied with.
Respondent absolved Judge Contreras and claimed that the latter had no knowledge that she was not properly remitting all her collections and that she misappropriated her collections for personal use.
Anent her failure to collect P1,000.00 from plaintiffs upon filing of a complaint to defray the actual travel expenses of the Sheriff, respondent claimed good faith as she merely followed the practice of the former clerk of court of collecting small sums of money based on the kilometrage fee estimated by the plaintiffs, and further claimed that the settings and notices were made in open court and sometimes coursed through the municipal police; hence, the services of sheriff are no longer needed.
Respondent apologized to the Court and begged to be given a second chance with a promise not to repeat the same acts and further requested that all her withheld salaries from February 2009 up to the present be applied as payment of her accountabilities and whatever balance remains, she expressed her willingness to settle the same.
Judge Contreras, on the other hand, in his letter dated January 27, 2010, averred that he did not take any action to relieve respondent Asetre from her collecting functions because as Presiding Judge of the first level court, his authority to supervise and monitor the performance of duties of respondent Asetre is limited to her adjudicative and administrative functions. He explained that he has no authority to relieve respondent Asetre in performing her financial functions, unless he is authorized by the Financial Management Office of the OCA (FMO-OCA). Thus, he recommended that the audit findings should be communicated instead to the FMO-OCA and to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Pili, Camarines Sur.
In a Resolution dated August 9, 2010, the Court directed the OCA to submit a consolidated evaluation, report and recommendation on the instant cases.
In a Memorandum dated March 8, 2011, the OCA found respondent Arlene B. Asetre guilty of Dishonesty, Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and recommended her dismissal from the service. The OCA likewise recommended that Judge Manuel E. Contreras be fined in the amount of P2,000.00 for simple negligence.
In a Resolution dated August 10, 2011, the Court resolved to re- docket both complaints as a regular administrative matter.
RULING
Clerks of court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises. As such, they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard and physical plant manager thereof.
[9]
  It is the clerks of courtâs duty to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities as such âto the end that there was full compliance with function, that of being the custodian of the courtâs funds and revenues, records, properties and premises.
[10]
  They are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts. It is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds. Thus, their failure to do so makes them liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.
Respondent miserably failed to live up to these stringent standards. She consistently incurred delays and shortages in the remittances of funds over long periods of time and offered no satisfactory explanation to justify her transgressions.
In the instant case, respondent's failure to remit court collections was in complete violation of Administrative Circular No. 3-2000, dated June 15, 2000, which commands that all fiduciary collections shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank. The procedural guidelines of this Circular provide:

Duty of the Clerks of Court, Officer-in-Charge or Accountable Officers.
 â The Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge of the Office of the Clerk of Court, or their accountable duly authorized representatives designated by them in writing, who must be accountable officers, shall receive the General Fund collections, issue the proper receipt therefor, 
maintain a separate cash book properly marked CASH BOOK FOR CLERK OF COURTâS GENERAL FUND AND SHERIFFâS GENERAL FUND, deposit such collections in the manner herein prescribed, and render the proper Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits for said Fund.
x x x (Emphases and underscoring ours.)
These Circulars are mandatory in nature, designed to promote full accountability for government funds and no protestation of good faith can override such mandatory nature. Failure to observe these Circulars resulting to loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of court funds and properties makes Asetre liable thereto.
It is the duty of clerks of court to perform their responsibilities faithfully, so that they can fully comply with the circulars on deposits of collections. They are reminded to deposit immediately, with authorized government depositaries, the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep those funds in their custody. The unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.
By failing to properly remit the cash collections constituting public funds, respondent violated the trust reposed in her as disbursement officer of the Judiciary. Her failure to deposit the said amount upon collection was prejudicial to the court, which did not earn interest income on the said amount or was not able to otherwise use the said funds.
[11]
 Her transgressions and her failure to satisfactorily explain her conduct, leave us no choice but to hold her liable for dishonesty, and to order her dismissal from office. The Court condemns any conduct, act or omission which violates the norm of public accountability or diminishes the faith of the people in the Judiciary.
Under Section 22 (a), (b) and (c) of Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Other Pertinent Civil Service Laws, Dishonesty is classified as a grave offense. The penalty for this offense is dismissal even for the first offense.
[12]
On the other hand, we remind Judge Contreras that he is mandated to perform administrative and supervisory functions, effective management of the court's day-to-day operations, including the supervision of their subordinates especially the safekeeping of funds. In this case, there is no doubt that Judge Contreras failed to exercise the required duty of monitoring the financial transactions of MTC, Ocampo, Camarines Sur, in strict compliance with the pertinent issuances and circulars of the court. Considering that the COA had already notified him of certain irregularities committed by respondent, Judge Contreras should have exercised prudence in immediately taking the necessary measures to prevent the latter from further diverting the court's fund.
Time and time again, this Court has stressed that those charged with the dispensation of justice  from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk  are circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. Their conduct, at all times, must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be beyond suspicion. Every employee should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty. 
[13]
 Thus, this Court has not hesitated to impose the ultimate penalty on those who have fallen short of their accountabilities.
