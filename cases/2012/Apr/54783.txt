LEAVE DIVISION, OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, OFFICE OF THE COURT OF ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. GEORGE E. GAREZA, SHERIFF III, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, VICTORIAS CITY, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




SERENO, J.:


George E. Gareza is a Sheriff III of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities in Victorias City, Negros Occidental. In a Report of Tardiness dated 03 March 2010 by Hermogena F. Bayani, Supreme Court Chief Judicial Staff Officer, Leave Division, Office of Administrative Services (OAS), Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), Gareza was found to have incurred tardiness as follows:
 
 
January 2009
 
12 times
 
 
 
April 2009
 
10 times
 
 
 
June 2009
 
10 times
 
 
 
October 2009
 
12 times
 
 
 
November 2009
 
14 times
 
 
 
January 2010
 
15 times
 
 
On 19 October 2010, the Court Administrator required Gareza to submit his Comment to the report about his tardiness.
On 19 November 2010, Gareza submitted his written comment to the OCA. In his letter dated 09 November 2010, Gareza did not deny the tardiness he had incurred and, in fact apologized for his infractions. He reasoned that his tardiness was brought about by his transfer of residence that made his travel to work longer than usual. Gareza asks that he be given another chance to âcorrect his errors.â
On 22 February 2011, the Court Administrator promulgated its evaluation that found Gareza to have incurred repeated tardiness on the dates reported by the Leave Division of the OAS. It noted that Gareza was previously reprimanded in a Minute Resolution dated 12 December 2010 in Administrative Matter No. P-10-2876 for habitual tardiness, making the present report his second for the same offense.
Hence, it was recommended by the OCA that (a) the case be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter and (b) that Gareza be suspended for a period of thirty (30) days pursuant to Section 52 (C) (4) Rule VI of the Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999 with warning that a repetition of  the same or similar offense will warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.
After a review of the records, we 
ADOPT
 the findings and recommendations of the OCA. Under Sec. 52 (C) (4), Rule VI of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999, habitual tardiness is penalized as follows:
First offense Reprimand
Second offense Suspension for 1-30 days
Third offense Dismissal from the service
Since it was proven that the present case is the second offense of Gareza for being habitually tardy, the OCA correctly recommended for the penalty of suspension for 30 days with warning that a similar offense in the future would be meted a more severe penalty.
WHEREFORE
, we 
AFFIRM 
in all respects the report of the OCA finding Gareza guilty of habitual tardiness and 
ADOPT
 its recommendation as follows:
1.) To have the instant case 
RE-DOCKETED
 as a regular administrative matter; and
2.) 
SUSPEND
 Gareza for thirty (30) days with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense will warrant the imposition of a more severe penalty.
SO ORDERED.
Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Perez,
 and 
Reyes, JJ.,
 concur.
