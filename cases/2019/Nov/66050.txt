DECISION




HERNANDO, J.:


Before this Court is a Petition  for 
Certiorari
[1]
 (under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court) with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order assailing the August 28, 2012
[2]
 and October 10, 2012
[3]
  Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan in  Criminal  Case  No.  SB-12-CRM-0149,  entitled  
People v. Salvacion Z. Perez,
 for having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion.   The August 28,  2012  Resolution  denied  petitioner Salvacion Zaldivar-Perez's  (Perez) Urgent Motion to Dismiss with Notice of Entry of Appearance and Prayer for Deferment of Arraignment, while the October 10, 2012 Resolution denied her Motion for Reconsideration.
The case stemmed from the following facts:
A  Complaint-Affidavit
[4]
 dated  April  28,  2006  for  Unlawful Appointment, defined and penalized under Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), was filed on May 17, 2006 with the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of San Jose, Antique (OPP-Antique), Department of Justice, by Numeriano Tamboong (Tamboong) against petitioner Perez, who was then the Provincial Governor of Antique.   Tamboong alleged that petitioner Perez appointed Atty. Eduardo S. Fortaleza (Fortaleza) on January 30, 2006 as the Provincial Legal Officer of the province despite knowing that he did not meet the minimum requirement of five (5) years in the practice of law under Section 481, Article XI, Title V of the Local Government Code of 1991.
[5]
In her Counter-Affidavit
[6]
  dated September 20, 2006, petitioner Perez argued that the appointment of Fortaleza is well-deserved because during his tenure as Provincial Legal Officer, he has been performing his duties and responsibilities with competence, honesty and integrity.   She added that the position is confidential and co-terminus, thus experience can be dispensed with as  provided under Rule X, Section 1(e) of the Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions under. the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum  Circular (MC) No. 40, Series of 1998.
[7]  
She also averred that as Provincial Governor, she is authorized to appoint employees embraced in the Non-Career Service in the Government.
In its Resolution
[8]
 dated August 6, 2009, the OPP-Antique ruled that there was sufficient evidence to support the existence of probable cause for Violation of Article 244 (Unlawful Appointments) of the RPC committed by petitioner Perez. It was noted that at the time of his appointment as Provincial Legal Officer, Fortaleza was a member of the Philippine Bar for only three (3) years, eight (8) months and twenty-eight (28) days, which is short of the 5-year minimum experience requirement as provided in Section 481 of the Local Government Code of 1991. In finding untenable petitioner Perez's justification that experience can be dispensed with as Fortaleza's  position is confidential, the OPP-Antique opined that CSC MC No. 1, series of 1977, is a rule of general application with respect to appointment and other personnel action, thus it cannot amend  a specific provision of a law. It is only the legislature that has the plenary power to repeal, abrogate or revoke existing laws. Thus, the OPP-Antique, in its August 6, 2009 Resolution, recommended that a criminal complaint for Violation of Article 244 of the RPC (Unlawful Appointments) be filed against petitioner Perez.
The original  records  of the case, together  with the August 6, 2009 Resolution,  were  forwarded  and  received  by the Deputy  Ombudsman for Visayas on October 8, 2009 for approval.
[9]
On October 12, 2009, the Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas endorsed
[10]
  the August 6, 2009 Resolution, together with the records of the case, to the Preliminary Investigation,  Administrative Adjudication and Review Bureau, an office under the supervision of Overall Deputy Ombudsman Orlando C. Casimiro  (Deputy  Ombudsman   Casimiro)  who  has  the  investigative jurisdiction over the case, pursuant to the July 10, 2008 Memorandum of Ombudsman Ma. Merceditas Gutierrez   (Ombudsman Gutierrez).
The initial indorsement of the Review Resolution of the said August 6, 2009 Resolution, recommending the approval of the filing of the Information against petitioner Perez for the offense complained of, was made on March 3, 2011 to Ombudsman Gutierrez.
[11]
 As there was a change of leadership in the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), a Review dated September 8, 2011 of the  August 6, 2009 Resolution  was again indorsed on September 26, 2011 by Deputy Ombudsman Casimiro to the newly appointed Ombudsman Conchita Carpio  Morales
[12]
   who  approved  the  said Resolution  on  April 24,  2012.
[13]
 Petitioner Perez was furnished a copy of the September 8, 2011 Review on May 10, 2012.
On May 24, 2012, an Information
[14]
  indicting petitioner Perez for Violation  of  Article  244  of the RPC (Unlawful  Appointments)  was filed before the Sandiganbayan. On May 28, 2012, the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution directing the Bureau of Immigration to bar petitioner Perez from leaving the country without its prior approval.   Petitioner Perez received a copy of the May 28, 2012 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan on May 30, 2012.
Incidentally, petitioner Perez filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[15]
 of the September 8, 2011 Review on June 19,  2012
[16]
 with the Office of the Overall Deputy Ombudsman who in turn indorsed the same to the OPP-Antique on June 26, 2012.
On July 3, 2012, the OPP-Antique received
[17]
 petitioner Perez's Urgent Motion to Dismiss with Notice of Entry of Appearance and Prayer for Deferment of Arraignment dated July 2, 2012 which was set for hearing
[18]
  on July 5, 2012.  In the said Motion, petitioner Perez complained of the delay in the preliminary investigation both before the OPP-Antique and the OMBÂ­ Visayas,
[19]
  which violated her constitutional right to a speedy disposition of the case, thus prayed for the dismissal of her case.
[20]
   According to petitioner Perez, it took the OPP-Antique more than three (3) years from the filing of the Affidavit-Complaint to conclude the preliminary investigation and to arrive at the Resolution dated August 6, 2009, which it indorsed to the Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas on October 8, 2009 for approval, while it took the OMB almost two (2) years from the date the Resolution of the OPP-Antique was endorsed to them up to the time the Review Resolution came out and almost three years from the date of the Resolution of the OPP-Antique to the filing of the Information before the Sandiganbayan.  Petitioner Perez argued that this protracted delay in the disposition of her case was prejudicial to her rights.
On July 12, 2012, the prosecution filed its Comment Opposition
[21]
  dated July 11, 2012 to the Petitioner's  Urgent Motion to Dismiss with Notice of Entry of Appearance and Prayer for Deferment of Arraignment. It argued that "there was no intentional delay on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman in the conduct of the preliminary investigation[,] neither was the proceeding attended by vexatious, capricious or oppressive delays [as] to prejudice the[petitioner] in her right to speedy disposition of her case."
[22]
Ruling of the Sandiganbayan
On August 28, 2012, the Sandiganbayan issued its first assailed Resolution denying Petitioner Perez's Motion to Dismiss with Notice of Entry of Appearance and Prayer for Deferment of Arraignment for lack of merit.
While the Sandiganbayan agreed with petitioner Perez that the Constitution guarantees her right to due process and speedy disposition of her case, however, it found that based on the circumstances obtaining in this case, both  the  OPP-Antique  and  the  OMB-Visayas  committed no  violation  of petitioner Perez's  aforesaid rights. The Sandiganbayan  noted that although there was a long delay in the preliminary investigation  of the case starting from the OPP-Antique, the record does not show that petitioner Perez had ever asserted   her  right  to  the   speedy   resolutions   of  the   said  preliminary investigation by following it up after she submitted her counter-affidavit or by filing any motion for the early resolution of the same both before the OPPÂ­ Antique and OMB-Visayas.  It was only after the arraignment was set on July 5, 2012 that petitioner Perez filed a Motion for Reconsideration raising delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation.  Having slept on her right to speedy disposition of her case for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time,  the  Sandiganbayan  ruled  that  petitioner  Perez  cannot  now  invoke violation of such right to justify the dismissal of the case as her inaction was tantamount to the waiver of her right.
As to the contention of petitioner Perez that the proceeding in this case should be deferred because of the pendency of the Motion for Reconsideration before the OMB-Visayas, the Sandiganbayan ruled that the filing of the Information with the Court on May 24, 2012 did not affect the validity of the Information as it did not deprive her of her right to seek reconsideration of the said Resolution.  Moreover, the only requirement under Section 7(a), Rule II of the Rules of Procedure  of the OMB (Administrative  Order No. 07, as amended) is that the Motion for Reconsideration should be filed within five (5) days from notice thereof with the OMB, or the Deputy Ombudsman as the case may be, with the corresponding leave of court in cases where the Information has already been filed in court.  The prosecution alleged that petitioner Perez failed to comply with  he said requirement when she filed her motion for reconsideration on the 21
st
 day from receipt of the September 11, 2011  Review of the Resolution  date   August 6, 2009.  However, petitioner Perez argued that her Motion for Reconsideration was filed within the period required by law.  At any rate, Section   (b), Rule II of the Rules of Procedure of     the OMB   also provides that the "filing of a motion for reconsideration/reinvestigation shall not bar the filing of the corresponding information in Court on the basis o the finding of probable cause in the resolution subject of the motion."
In the end, the Sandiganbayan ruled:
 
WHEREFORE,
 in light of all the foregoing, the accused's 
Urgent Motion to Dismiss With Notice of  Entry of Appearance and Prayer for Deferment of Arraignment,
 dated July  2, 2012, is hereby 
DENIED
 for lack of merit.
The arraignment of the accused is hereby set on September 27, 2012 at 8:30 in the morning.
SO ORDERED.
[23]
 
Aggrieved, petitioner Perez filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the above Resolution of  the  Sandiganbayan which was opposed by  the prosecution for being a reiteration of her arguments in her previous motion.
[24]
In its Resolution
[25]
   dated October 10, 2012, the Sandiganbayan denied petitioner  Perez's   Motion  for  Reconsideration   on  the  ground  that  the arguments set forth therein were a mere rehash or reiteration of the arguments in her Urgent Motion to Dismiss, and Reply which the Court had already judiciously considered and passed upon, except for the issue that the Information was filed by the Investigating Prosecutor without the prior written authority or approval of the Provincial or City Prosecutor or Chief State Prosecutor or the Ombudsman or his Deputy.
Hence, this Petition for 
Certiorari.
Petitioner Perez seeks to reverse and set aside the August 28, 2012 and October 10, 2012 Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan on the ground that said court gravely abused its discretion when it refused: 1) to defer the proceeding in the criminal case in light of the pending Motion for Reconsideration filed before the OMB-Visayas; 2) to dismiss the criminal case despite the fact that an Information was filed without proper authority; and 3)   to dismiss the criminal case despite the fact that there was undue and unjustifiable delay in the resolution of the said case by the OMB-Visayas in grave violation of her constitutional right to due process and speedy disposition of the case against her.
Petitioner Perez maintains that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it refused to defer the proceeding in this case due to the pending Motion for Reconsideration before the OMB.
We hold otherwise.
The issue raised by petitioner has already been addressed by the Court in 
Garcia v. Sandiganbayan
[26]
 where We held:
From the filing of information, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court, which becomes the sole judge on what to do with the case before it. Pursuant to said authority, the court takes full authority over the case, including the manner of the conduct of litigation and resort to processes that will ensure the preservation of its jurisdiction. Thus, it may issue warrants of arrest, HDOs and other processes that it deems warranted under the circumstances.
In this case, the Sandiganbayan acted within its jurisdiction when it issued  the  HDOs  against  the  petitioner.  
That the petitioner may seek reconsideration  of the finding of probable cause against her by the OMB does not undermine nor suspend the jurisdiction already acquired by the Sandiganbayan.   There  was  also  no denial  of  due  process  since  the petitioner was not precluded from filing a motion for reconsideration of the resolution of the OMB. In addition, the resolution of her motion for reconsideration before the OMB and the conduct of the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan  may proceed concurrently.
Moreover, the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman expressly provides that the filing of motion of reconsideration does not prevent the filing of information. Section 7, Rule II of Administrative Order No. 07 reads:
Section 7. Motion for reconsideration
 a)  Only one motion for reconsideration or reinvestigation of an approved order or resolution shall be allowed, the same to be filed within five (5) days from notice thereof with the Office of the Ombudsman, or the proper Deputy Ombudsman as the case may be, with corresponding leave of court in cases where information has already been  filed in court;
b)   The filing of a motion for reconsideration/reinvestigation shall not bar the filing of the corresponding information in Court on the basis of the finding of probable cause in the resolution subject of the motion.  (As   amended  by Administrative Order No. 15, dated February 16, 2000) x x x 
As can be understood from the foregoing, an information may be filed even before the lapse of the period to file a motion for reconsideration of the finding of probable cause. The investigating prosecutor need not wait until the resolution of the motion for reconsideration before filing the information with the Sandiganbayan especially that his findings and recommendation  already carry the stamp of approval of the Ombudsman. In any case, the continuation of the proceedings is not dependent on the resolution of the motion for reconsideration by the investigating prosecutor. In the event that, after a review of the case, the investigating prosecutor was convinced that there is no sufficient evidence to warrant a belief that the accused  committed  the  offense,  his resolution  will  not  result  to  the automatic dismissal of the case or withdrawal of information already filed before  the  Sandiganbayan.  The matter  will  still  depend  on  the  sound discretion of the court. Having acquired jurisdiction over the case, the Sandiganbayan is not bound by such  resolution but is required to evaluate it  before  proceeding  further  with   the  trial  and  should  embody  such assessment in the order disposing the motion. Thus, in
 Fuentes v. Sandiganbayan,
  the Court emphasized:
 The court is not to the mere approval or disapproval of the stand taken by the prosecution. The court must itself be convinced that there is   indeed no sufficient evidence against the accused and this conclusion can only be reached after an assessment of the evidence in the possession of the prosecution. What is required is the court's own assessment of such evidence. (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied) 
Petitioner Perez likewise alleges that the Information filed against her should be declared null and void because it was filed without the authority of the Ombudsman or her Deputy. She argues that the Information was prepared by the Investigating Prosecutor on September 8, 2011 and sworn to on the same date or months ahead of its approval by Ombudsman Carpio Morales on April 24, 2012.
Petitioner Perez's contention is not well-taken.
As correctly found by the Sandiganbayan, the prosecution did not commit  any  violation   considering   that  the   Ombudsman   approved   the September 8, 2011 Review of the August 6, 2009 Resolution on April 24, 2012  and when  it was filed  on May  24, 2012,  the  Information  bore the approval of Ombudsman Carpio Morales.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, We hold that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse  of  discretion amounting to lack or excess  of jurisdiction when it ruled that there was no violation of petitioner Perez's right to the speedy disposition of her case.
"The right to speedy disposition of cases x x x enshrined in Section 16, Article III of the Constitution x x x declares in no uncertain terms that '[a]ll persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial,   quasi-judicial,   or  administrative   bodies. [This constitutional mandate demands] the swift resolution or termination of a pending case or proceeding. The right to a speedy disposition of cases is deemed violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays.     What  the  Constitution  prohibits  are  unreasonable,  arbitrary  and oppressive delays which render rights nugatory."
[27]
In 
Dela PeÃ±a v. Sandiganbayan,
[28]
  the Court laid down certain guidelines to determine whether the right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated, to wit:
The concept of speedy disposition is relative or flexible. A mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved is not sufficient.  Particular regard must be taken of the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case. Hence, the doctrinal rule is that in the determination of whether that right has been violated, the factors that may be considered and balanced are as follows: (1) the length of delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the assertion or failure to assert such right by the accused; and (4) the prejudice caused by the delay. (Citations omitted)
After a careful review of the facts and circumstances of this case and following he above principle, We find that petitioner Perez's right to speedy disposition of the case against her has been transgressed.
First, 
as to the length of delay.
The  records  show  that  Tamboong's  Complaint-Affidavit  was  filed before the OPP-Antique on May 17, 2006.  On September 21, 2006, petitioner Perez filed her counter-affidavit  dated   September 20, 2006.  On September 28, 2006, Tamboong filed his Reply-Affidavit.  After finding probable cause, the OMB-Visayas issued a Resolution dated August 6, 2009 recommending that a criminal complaint for Unlawfull Appointment be filed against petitioner Perez.  On  October 12, 2009, the August 6, 2009 Resolution was forwarded and received by the Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas for review.   The initial indorsement of the Review Resolution of the August 6, 2009 Resolution was made on March 3, 2011 to Ombudsman Gutierrez.   As there was a change of leadership in the OMB, a Review dated September 8, 2011 of the August 6, 2009 Resolution  was again indorsed on September 26, 2011 to the newly appointed  Ombudsman  Carpio-Morales  who  approved  the  said  Review Resolution on April 24, 2012.  On May 24, 2012 an Information indicting petitioner Perez for Violation of Article 244 of the RPC (Unlawful Appointments) was filed with the Sandiganbayan.
From the foregoing facts, approximately six years had elapsed from May 17, 2006, the time when the complaint-affidavit  was filed before the OPP-Antique, until May 24, 2012, when the case was filed before the Sandiganbayan. The OPP-Antique took almost three years from the filing of the  Complaint-Affidavit   within  which  to  conclude  the  preliminary investigation and to arrive at its August 6, 2009 Resolution, while it took the OMB for Visayas more than three years from the date the August 6, 2009 Resolution was endorsed to it up to the time the Review Resolution was finalized on September 8, 2011 and approved by Ombudsman Carpio Morales on September 26, 2011.  Still, it took  he Ombudsman another eight months from the approval of the September 8, 2011 Review of the August 6, 2009 Resolution up to the filing of the complaint before the Sandiganbayan on May 24, 2012. This period to conduct and complete the preliminary investigation is already excessive.  Such a long delay was unreasonable and inordinate so as to constitute an outright violation of the speedy disposition of petitioner Perez's case.
Second, 
as to the reason for the delay.
Valid  reasons  for  the  delay identified and  accepted  by  the  Court include, but are not limited to: (1) extraordinary complications such as the degree of difficulty of the questions involved, the number of persons charged, the various pleadings  filed, and the voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence on record; and (2) acts attributable  to the respondents.
[29]
We note that the prosecution offered no explanation regarding the delay in conducting the  preliminary   investigation and  in  its  findings  indicting petitioner Perez of the offense charged. The charge of Unlawful Appointment based  on  the  ground  that  the  appointee   does  not  possess  the  minimum requirement for the said position is a simple case and does not involve a complicated  and complex  issue that would  require  the painstaking  scrutiny and perusal of the Ombudsman that would warrant the protracted  delay. It bears  stressing  that  this  case  involved  only  petitioner  Perez  and  the  only pleading  that she filed was her Counter-Affidavit and nothing  else. Clearly, the  delay  in  this case is a disregard  of  the  Ombudsman's  Constitutional mandate  to  be the  "protector of the  people"  and  as  such,  required to act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against officers and employees of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, in order to promote efficient service.
[30]
Third,
 with regard to the assertion or failure to assert such right by the accused.
The Court disagrees  with the ratiocination of the Sandiganbayan that laches had already set in because petitioner Perez failed or neglected for an unreasonable length of time to assert her right to a speedy termination  of the preliminary  investigation or to file a motion  for early resolution  of the said investigation before the OPP-Antique.  It is not for the petitioner  to ensure that  the  wheels  of  justice  continue to  turn. Rather,  it  is  for  the  State  to guarantee that the case is disposed  within a reasonable  period. Thus, it is of no   moment   that   petitioner Perez   did   not   file   any   motion   before   the Ombudsman  to expedite  the proceeding. It is sufficient that she raised  the constitutional  infraction  prior to her arraignment  before the Sandiganbayan.
[31]  
In
 Cervantes v. Sandiganbayan
[32]
  we emphatically held:
It is  the  duty  of  the  prosecutor  to  speedily  resolve  the  complaint,  as mandated by the Constitution, regardless of whether the petitioner did not object to the delay or that the delay was with his acquiescence provided that it was not due to causes directly attributable to him.
Similarly, we pointed out in
 Coscolluela  v. Sandiganbayan
[33]
  that:
Being the respondents in the preliminary investigation proceedings, it was not the petitioners' duty to follow up on the prosecution of their case. Conversely, it was the Office of the Ombudsman's responsibility to expedite the same within the bounds of reasonable timeliness in view of its mandate to promptly act on all complaints lodged before it. As pronounced in the case of 
Baker v. Wingo
:
 A defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; the State has that duty as well as the duty of insuring that the trial is consistent with due process. (Citation omitted) 
 
Fourth,
 prejudice caused by the delay.
There is no doubt that petitioner Perez was prejudiced by the inordinate delay in the conduct of the preliminary investigation.   The lapse of six years before the filing of the Information with the Sandiganbayan placed her in a situation of uncertainty.  This protracted period of uncertainty over her case caused her anxiety, suspicion and even hostility. The inordinate delay defeats the salutary objective of the right to speedy disposition of cases, which is "to assure that an innocent person may be free from the anxiety and expense of litigation or, if otherwise, of having his guilt determined within the shortest possible time compatible with the presentation and   consideration of whatsoever legitimate defense he may interpose."
[34]
   To perpetuate a violation of this right by the lengthy and unreasonable delay would result to petitioner Perez's   inability  to  adequately  prepare  for  her  case and  would  create  a situation where the defense  witnesses were unable to recall accurately the events of the distant past, leading to the impairment  of petitioner Perez's possible defenses.
[35]
  This, we cannot countenance without running afoul to the Constitution.
Thus, in view of the foregoing, it is indubitable that petitioner Perez's constitutional right to speedy disposition of her case had been infringed. Perforce, the assailed resolutions must be set aside and the criminal case filed against petitioner Perez be dismissed.
WHEREFORE,
 the  Petition for 
 Certiorari
   is  
GRANTED.
 The August 28, 2012 and October 10, 2012 Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0149 are 
REVERSED  and  SET  ASIDE.
 Criminal Case No. SB-12-CRM-0149 against petitioner Salvacion ZaldivarÂ­ Perez is hereby
