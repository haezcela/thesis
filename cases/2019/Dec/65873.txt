REYES, J. JR., J.:


The management enjoys the discretion to assign and transfer employees to other work stations. The transfer is valid inasmuch as it does not involve a demotion in rank or diminution in pay or benefits, and was carried out in good faith and justified by business exigencies.
This treats of the petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision
[2]
 dated March 31, 2016, and the Resolution
[3]
 dated November 3, 2016, rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 138334, which affirmed with modification the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)  holding   that  respondent  Francia  B.  Deguidoy   (Deguidoy)   was constructively dismissed by petitioner Automatic Appliances, Lnc. (AAI).
AAI is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines.     Petitioners   Samson F. Lim,  Cornelio   P. Buenaventura   and Cristine M. Pontillas  (Pontillas)  are the former President, Vice President for Human Resource and Tutuban Branch Manager, respectively, of said corporation.
[4]
The antecedent  facts reveal that on June 3, 1998, AAI hired Deguidoy as a regular Sales Coordinator  in its Cubao Branch.  As a sals coordinator, she  was  tasked  with  selling  merchandise  and  was  required  to maintain  a branch sales quota.
[5]
Sometime in 2013, AAI suffered a decline in its sales and experienced economic  difficulties.    Consequently,  on  March  6,  2013,  it  implemented cost-cutting  measures, which included closing some of its branches.   In line with the closure  of its branches, AAI issued  a Memorandum dated July 1, 2013,  informing  its  employees  of  their  re-shuffling  and  re-assignment  to AAI's  various  branches.   As a result,  Deguidoy  was  re-assigned  from  the Cubao branch to the Tutuban Branch.  She accepted her re-assignment.
[6]
While  at  the  Tutuban  Branch,  Deguidoy  failed  to  reach  her  sales quota.   Worse,  the   Branch   Attendance   Time  Log   Report   showed   that she  incurred   29  days  of  unexplained   absences   from  March   to  August 2013.   Added to this, her sales performance  continued  to decline while her co-employees surpassed their sales quotas.
[7]
Concerned about Deguidoy's dismal performance  at work, on June 14, 2013, the management  of AAI urged her to undergo counselirtg to improve her performance.    During  the counseling  session,  Deguidoy  explained  that her poor perfonnance at work was due to her weight gain, which rendered it difficult to stand and perform her tasks as a Sales Coordinator.'  In response, AAI  suggested  a lateral  transfer  as a receptionist  clerk  or invoicing  clerk, where she could work behind a desk.  However, she refused the offer.
[8]
Meanwhile,   on  August   2,  2013,  AAI  received   a  letter  from  the Tutuban  Branch  Manager  Pontillas  notifying  the  management  about Deguidoy's   poor   work   performance.
[9]
     Pontillas   likewise   requested   for additional sales personnel at the Tutuban Branch.
Hearing this, AAI conducted a review of Deguidoy's records and sales outputs.     This  led  to  the  discovery that  Deguidoy   incurred  numerous absences  and  had  a low  sales  output.   AAI  issued  Attendance  Infraction Memos  dated August  27, 2013  and an Inefficiency  and Gross Negligence Memo  of even  date.   Deguidoy  was   placed  under  one-month  suspension. She accepted the suspension and apologized for her faults.
[10]
On October 7, 2013, Deguido   reported back to work.  On even date, AAI verbally informed her of an intended transfer to its Ortigas branch. Dismayed, Deguidoy left during her lunch break, and never returned.
[11]
On  October  11, 2013,  AAI  sent Deguidoy  a letter  requiring  her to explain her failure to report for work.  Deguidoy ignored the said letter. AAI sent another letter on October 19, 2013.  Still, the same was unheeded.
[12]
Unknown  to AAI,  on  October 14,  2013,  Deguidoy  filed a case for illegal dismissal with money claims including 13th month pay. 
[13]
Ruling of the Labor Arbiter
On February 28, 2014, the Labor Arbiter (LA) rendered a Decision dismissing  Deguidoy's complaint  for  illegal dismissal  based on its finding that  Deguidoy  was  not  terminated,  but  was  simply  being  transferred  to another branch.
[14]
However,  the  LA ordered  the payment  of proportionate  13th month
The dispositive portion of the LA's decision reads: 
WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, judgment  is hereby rendered DISMISSING  the  complaint   for  lack  of  merit.  However,  respondent AUTOMATIC CENTER HOME APPPLIANCES, INC., is ordered to pay complainant  proportionate  13th month pay.
1/1113-10/7/13 
476 X  26 X 9.23 = P9,519.20
In the meantime,  Mr. Samson Lim, Nel P. Buenaventura  and Ms. Cristine M. Pontillas are ordered DR   PPED as party respondents.
SO ORDERED.
[15]
In view of the LA decision, AAI sent Deguidoy a notice to report for work.  However, instead of reporting back to work, Deguidoy filed a Partial Memorandum of Appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). On appeal, Deguidoy changed  her cause of action from actual illegal dismissal to constructive dismissal.
Ruling of the NLRC
On July 28, 2014, the NLRC reversed and set aside the ruling of the LA, and held that Deguidoy was constructively dismissed.   The NLRC theorized that AAI'S acts were calculated to dismiss Deguidoy from employment.   Consequently, the NLRC ordered AAI to pay Deguidoy backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. 
[16]
The dispositive portion of the NLRC decision reads:
ACCORDINGLY,
 the decision appealed from is set aside and a new  one  
ENTERED
  finding  complainant  [Deguidoy]  illegally constructively dismissed.  Respondent-appellees are hereby ordered to pay complainant: the amount already adjudged to her; her full backwages from August 27, 2013 up to the finality hereof; and, in lieu of reinstatement, to pay her separation pay at the rate of one (1) month pay from the date of hire on June 3, 1998 until t4e finality of this Decision.
SO ORDERED
.
[17]
 (Emphases in the original)
Dissatisfied with the ruling, AAI filed a Petition for 
Certiorari 
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with the CA.
Ruling of the CA
On March 31, 2016, the CA rendered  the assailed Decision 
[18]
 affirming with modification the NLRC's ruling.  The CA found that Deguidoy was constructively dismissed by AAI. According to the CA, Deguidoy was being transferred to the Ortigas branch, which was on the verge of being closed. Likewise, the evidence presented by AAI was not sufficient to prove that her transfer was intended to help her achieve a better sales performance.  Neither was there sufficient evidence to prove that the Ortigas branch was less frequented by customers as claimed by AAI, and that Deguidoy's weight problem greatly affected her performance at work. 
[19]
    Accordingly, the CA ordered  Deguidoy's reinstatement without  loss of seniority  rights  and the payment of full backwages,  which s  all be computed from October 7, 2013 - the date  when  Deguidoy  was notified of the  intended  transfer  until her actual reinstatement.
[20]
The dispositive portion of the   assailed CA decision reads:
WHEREFORE, 
the foregoing  considered,  the instant  petition  is
 PARTIALLY GRANTED. 
  The portion of the  Decision  dated July 28, 2014  of the  [NLRC]  ordering  petitioners  to pay private  respondent  full backwages from August 27, 2013 up to the finality of the decision and separation  pay are
 ANNULED
 and   
SET  ASIDE.
 Petitioners  are hereby ordered to:
(a)  
REINSTATE
 [Deguidoy] to her former position  without loss of seniority rights and other privileges;
(b) 
PAY
 [Deguidoy]  backwages inclusive of allowances and other benefits  or their  monetary  equivalent, computed  from  the time she was illegally dismissed on October 7, 2013, until her actual reinstatement.
The [LA] is hereby 
ORDERED
 to make another recomputation of the total monetary benefits due to petitioner in accordance with this Decision.
SO ORDERED.
[21]
Undeterred,  AAI  filed  the  instant  petition  for  review  on  
certiorari 
under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court.
The Issue
The crux of the instant case rests on whether or not Deguidoy was constructively dismissed by AAI.
AAI points out that Deguidoyâs original allegation was that she was actually dismissed  from her employment.   She cannot conveniently change her theory on appeal, as the same is violative of the essence of due process.
[22]
 As  such,  the  allegation  of  construtiive  dismissal  should  not  have  been considered by the CA.
[23]
Likewise, AAI claims that Deguidoy failed to support her charge of illegal dismissal - both actual and constructive.  She was neither given a termination letter nor barred from the work premises.   Neither was she constructively dismissed.  AAI explains that its decision to transfer her to the Ortigas branch was a valid exercise of its management prerogative to streamline its operations.  It was spurred by her poor performance and her inability to reach the sales quota.  Moreover, it was Deguidoy who related that her weight gain had rendered it difficult to perform her work.
[24]
Furthermore, AAI denies Deguidoy's claim that it wanted to get rid of her services.   It points out that they constantly sent Deguidoy  notices to report for work. However, the latter refused to comply with the said directives.
[25]
In the same vein, AAI rebuts Deguidoy's  claim that she was being eased out.  It clarifies that at the time of the intended transfer, the Ortigas branch was fully operational and in need of additional personnel.
[26]
On the other hand, Deguidoy maintains that her transfer was without any basis and was a ploy to ease her out.  She claims that she was forced to leave her work due to the harassment she experienced in her workplace.  Her previous work was rendered unreasonable, undesirable and unlikely.
[27]
 She submits that the notices to report for work sent by AAI were a means of "harassing" her.
[28]
Similarly, Deguidoy counters that the grounds given by AAI to justifY her transfer, such as poor performance, tardiness, and even her weight, were not proven by substantial evidence.  She avers that AAI failed to prove that her transfer was due to a genuine business necessity.
[29]
Ruling of the Court
The instant petition is impressed with merit. 
Management  Enjoys     the 
Prerogative    to     Transfer     
Its Employees    and     Regulate     
Their Work Assignments
Labor laws are not one-sided. Although   the   law  bends  over backwards to accommodate the need   of the working class, not every labor dispute shall be decided in favor o  labor.
[30]
     Indeed, the Constitutional provisions on social justice as well as labor laws guarantee the protection of the employees'  tenurial  security.   However, this tenurial security shall not grant the employees a vested right to their desired position.   Rather, management  possesses  the  right  to  regulate  all  aspects  of  employment relating to the employees' work assig ment and working methods.
[31]
Particularly, under the doctrine of  management   prerogative,   an employer possesses the inherent rig t to regulate, according to its "own discretion and judgment, all aspects   f employment, including hiring, work assignments, working methods, the time, place and manner of work, work supervision, transfer of employees, lay-off of workers, and discipline, dismissal,  and  recall  of  employees."
[32]
       This  wide  sphere  of authority to regulate its own business may only b   curbed by the limitations imposed by labor  laws  and  the  principles  of    equity  and  substantial  justice.     The importance  of  discouraging  interference  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the employer   may   in   turn   expect   go  d   performance,   satisfactory   work, diligence, good conduct and loyalty from its employees
[33]
Accordingly,  the  employer  m y  determine,  in  accordance  with  its sound business judgment, its employees work assignments.  This discretion to impose work assignments, or corollarily, transfer the employees shall be based on the employer's  assessment of the "qualifications, aptitudes and competence  of its employees."
[34]
     The employer is allowed to move them around various areas of its business     operations to ascertain where they will function with maximum benefit to the company.
[35]
   After all, the employer is in the best position to determine where its employees will thrive for the good of the company.
It is imperative, however, to strike balance between the employees' tenurial   security   on   the   one  hand,   and  the   employer's   management prerogative, on the other.   In 
Rural   Bank of Cantilan, Inc. v. Julve,
[36]
  and 
Peckson v. Robinsons  Supermarket Co poration, et al.,
[37]
the Court laid down guidelines to ensure that both rights are  protected:
Concerning the transfer of employees, these are the following jurisprudential guidelines: (a) a transfer is a movement from one position to another of equivalent rank, level or salary without break in the service or a lateral movement from one position to another of equivalent rank or salary; (b) the employer has the inherent right to transfer or reassign an employee  for   legitimate   business  purposes;   (c)  a  transfer   becomes unlawful where it is motivated by discrimination or bad faith or is effected as a form of punishment or is a demotion without sufficient cause; (d) the employer must be able to show that the transfer is not unreasonable, inconvenient, or prejudicial to the employee.
[38]
   (Citations omitted)
Accordingly, the Court respects the right of the employer to re-assign its   employees   to   other   stations,   provided   that   the   transfer   is   not unreasonable, inconvenient, prejudicial, or involve a demotion in rank or a diminution of salaries, benefits, and other privileges. For as long as said conditions  are  met,  the  employee  may  not  complain  that  the  transfer amounts to a constructive dismissal.
[39]
AAI's Decision to Transfer 
Deguidoy  to  its  Ortigas  Branch Was   
 a   Valid   Exercise   of   its Management 
Prerogative.  Her Intended  Transfer  was
 Not  Akin to a Constructive Dismissal
It must  be  noted  at  the  outset  that  Deguidoy  was  not  actually transferred to the Ortigas branch.  The facts show that on October 7, 2013, she was verbally informed that management intended to re-assign her at the Ortigas branch. Apparently, this offer did not sit well with her, and she went out of the Tutuban store, and no longer returned.   Days after the said conversation, she immediately filed a case for illegal (actual) dismissal on October 14, 2013.  Thereafter, she contumaciously ignored all the directives to  report  back  to  work.
[40]
 She  construed  the  management's  decision  to transfer her as a form of  dismissal.  This was based on her apprehension that the said branch was about to be closed.
The Court does not agree.
At any rate, even if the transfer actually took place, said transfer is not tantamount   to   a   constructive   dismissal. Essentially,   "[c]onstructive dismissal exists where there is cessation of work, because 'continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay' and other benefits."
[41]
 It is regarded as a dismissal in disguise or an act amounting to dismissal but made to appear  as if it were not. It may take place when the employer commits an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain, such that the employment becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee and leaves him/her no choice except to forego his/her continued employment.
[42]
Deguidoy's Intended Transfer Did 
Not Involve a Demotion in Rank or 
A Diminution in Pay. Likewise, The 
Decision Was Spurred by A Genuine  
Necessity to  Streamline the Business 
Operations
Jurisprudence holds that the management's decision to transfer an employee shall not be assailed as a form of constructive dismissal in the absence  of  proof  that  the  re-assignment  involves  a  demotion  in  rank, diminution in pay, or was an act of discrimination or disdain.
[43]
In the instant case, the intended transfer did not involve a demotion in rank or diminution in pay, salaries and benefits.  Deguidoy was simply asked to transfer  to a different  location w  ere she  will be occupying the same position and performing the same functions.
Equally important, the decision to transfer Deguidoy came after a painstaking evaluation of her performance at the Tutuban branch.  This was spurred   by   a   letter   sent   by   Pontillas   reporting   Deguidoy's   dismal performance  at  work. Because  of the latter's  inability  to cope with the demands of her work, Pontillas even requested for additional staff who could carry Deguidoy's load.
[44]
    Surely, an a  additional complement would have been unnecessary if Deguidoy was able to   perform her work adequately.
It bears  noting  that  AAI  was  engaged  in  the  business  of  selling appliances and other similar product .  Consequently, it had a right to aim for a high volume of sales output, an   device of ways and means to achieve a high sales target.  In relation thereto  Deguidoy, as a sales coordinator, was tasked   to   assist   the   branch   in     chieving   a   high   output   of   sales. Unfortunately,  however,  Deguidoy's   sales  performance  at  the  Tutuban branch was very meager compared to that of the branch top performer, and consisted of a small contribution to t  e total branch output.  This was based onAAI's records.
[45]
In  addition  to  her  low  sales  output,  Deguidoy   was  found  to  have incurred numerous  unexplained  absences.  She failed to report for work for a total  of 29  days  within  a six-month  period.    From  2009  until  2013,  AAI issued various notices requiring her to explain, which she ignored.
[46]
It becomes  all too apparent  that AAI's  decision  to transfer  Deguidoy to the Ortigas branch was triggered  by the need to streamline  its operations. The Tutuban branch needed manpower, whose functions Deguidoy could not fulfill.   Meanwhile,  the Ortigas  branch was frequented  by less.er customers, and   was   in  need   of  additional   personnel,   for   which   Deguidoy   could adequately respond.  In fact, the re-assignment  was viewed as a means to aid her increase her sales target.
Similar to the instant case, in Peckson,
[47]
 the Court respected the management's decision  to transfer  its recalcitrant  employee  who was habitually tardy and inconsistent  in attendance to a branch that would be less affected by her laziness.  The Court explained:
As a privilege inherent in the employer's right to control and manage its  enterprise effectively, its  freedom to  conduct its  business operations to achieve its purpose cannot be denied.   We agree with the appellate court that the respondents are justified in moving the petitioner to another equivalent position, which presumably would be less affected by her habitual tardiness or inconsistent attendance than if she continued as a Category Buyer, a "frontline position" in the day-to-day business operations of a supermarket such as Robinsons.
[48]
  (Citations omitted)
Equally  important,  in 
Benguet Electric Cooperative v. Fianza,
[49]
  the Court  emphasized   that  the  management   has  the  discretion   to  determine where  its empl,oyees are best  suited  to work.    In this  regard,  the  transfer could not be assailed  as a form  of constructive  dismissal,  considering  that the  management   had  the  prerogative   to  determine   the  place  where  the employee is best qualified to serve the interests of the business given the qualifications,  training and performance  of the affected employee.
[50]
A similar  pronouncement was reached in 
Chateau Royale Sports and Country  Club,  Inc.  v.  Balba,  et  al.,
[51]
 where   the  Court   respected   the employer's assessment  that the transfer  would be in the best interest of the employee, despite the latter's protests.  The Court further stressed that the employee  may not  assail  the management's decision  on the pretext  of the inconvenience  the transfer  may cause.   What matters  is that the transfer  is not unreasonable or oppressive, and   w ill not lead to a demotion in rank, or diminution of benefits and salaries.
[52]
AAI Did Not Act in  Bad Faith in Informing 
Deguidoy of Her Intended Transfer
The  records  are  bereft  of  proof  that  Deguidoy  was  discriminated against.    In  as  early  as March  6,    013, AAI  undertook  a review of  its company  policies,  rules  and  regulations,  and  sought  to  implement costÂ­ cutting measures.  This led to a decis on to close down certain branches.  In line with this, AAI implemented  re-assignments and reshuffling of its personnel  in  its  branches.
[53]
 Deguidoy  was  merely  one  of  the  many employees transferred.  She was never  singled out.
Moreover, neither did AAI act with disdain against Deguidoy. On the contrary,  it  even  sought  ways  to  help improve  her  performance  at  the Tutuban branch.  The management cal ed Deguidoy's attention to discuss the reasons behind her dismal sales performance. Instead of imposing sanctions, the management even offered to give   her counseling.  During the counseling sessions,  Deguidoy  admitted  that  h r  poor  performance  was due  to her weight gain which rendered it difficult for her to stand and perform her tasks as a sales coordinator.   
This was supported by her medical records.   Her Medical  Certificate  dated  March  2,    011 showed  that  she then  weighed 151.8 pounds.   A later Medical Examination Report dated June 18, 2014 confirmed that her weight ballooned t   176 pounds.  Deguidoy stands at four feet and eight inches (4'8").   As a solution, the management offered her a lateral transfer as a receptionist clerk or invoicing clerk, where she would not need to stand for prolonged period  of time. However, Deguidoy refused the offer and promised to improve her   performance.
[54]
The  aforementioned  reports  likewise show that the CA erred in opining that there was no truth to AAIâs purported claim that Deguidoyâs weight gain affected her performance at work. Said documents likewise belie Deguidoyâs contention that she was discriminated against because of her weight. 
In 
Best wear Garments v. De Lemos, et al.,
[55]
 the Court stressed that absent any proof of discrimination or   disdain on the part of the employer in transferring its employees, it is unfair  to charge the former with constructive dismissal  simply on  the employees'   insistence that the transfer to a new work assignment was against their will 
[56]
The Intended Transfer Was Not a 
Scheme to Dismiss Deguidoy
The Court does not agree with Deguidoy's claim that her transfer was a ploy to "ease her out" of the company.
It bears   stressing   that   although   the   Ortigas   branch   closed   on November 26, 2013,
[57]
  what matters is that at the time the intended transfer was proposed to Deguidoy, the branch was still fully operational and in need of additional personnel.
[58]
 Interestingly, the 168 branch, where Deguidoy requested to be transferred, likewise closed on February 21, 2014.
[59]
   This just  shows  that  at  the  time  the  notice  was  sent  to  Deguidoy, there  was nothing questionable about AAI's offer.
Furthermore, said allegation that AAI was scheming to rid itself of Deguidoy's services, aside from being unsubstantiated, was di proved by the former's continuous efforts to call Deguidoy back to work.  In fact, when the case was dismissed by the LA, AAI immediately issued a Notice to Report on April 11, 2014.  This was followed by several directives to report back for work, consisting of a Notices to Return to Work dated April. 23, 2014 and May 5, 2014.
[60]
    Subsequently, another notice was sent after the CA decision, to which Deguidoy responded, but intimated that she was nqt yet ready to return.  Instead, she filed for a vacation leave from May 16 to 20, 2016.
[61]
Seemingly, it was actually Deguidoy who continuously and contumaciously  refused  to  abide  by the  notices  and  orders  sent  by AAI. Worse, her conduct is not reflective of one who was treated with disdain or discriminated against.  Rather, she immediately refused the intended transfer without discussing it further with her branch manager.   She was a given a notice  to explain  why she  left for work  on October  7,  2013.    However, instead  of  taking  the  opportunity  to  converse  with  the  management,  she opted to immediately file a case for illegal dismissal.  Also, during the conferences before the LA, she obstinately insisted on being assigned to the 168 branch.
[62]
Based on the foregoing, it is all too apparent that 
Deguidoy  was not constructively dismissed.   
 AAI's  decision  to  transfer  her  to  its  Ortigas branch  was   the   result   of   an  assiduous   review   of   the   latter's   work performance  balanced  alongside  the  company's  business  needs.    It  was backed by evidence  consisting  of Deguidoy's  sales output and attendance records.   In the same vein, AAI's re-assignments, for which Deguidoy was affected, was  not  a spur  of the moment  move.   It began as a series  of measures to streamline its operations.  Deguidoy was not singled out or discriminated against.
Indeed, an employee enjoys the right to be protected against any act of discrimination or disdain which renders his/her continued employment unreasonable or unlikely. However, this should not be used by the employee as a bargaining chip to insist on his/her desired assignment. Management has the right to assign an employee at any station, if it believes that the transfer is best for its business.  Absent any bad faith on its part, the Court shall not interfere with the managementâs prerogative.
Considering that Deguidoy was not constructively dismissed, she shall be reinstated to her former position without any backwages.  Deguidoy is ordered to report for work at the Tutu an branch.  This is in accord with the Court's ruling in 
Claudia's Kitchen, Inc. v. Tanguin,
[63]
   where it was held that if "the employee was neither found to have been dismissed nor to have abandoned his/her work, the general course of action is for the 
Court  to dismiss the complaint, direct the employee to return  to work, and order the employer to accept the employee  .
"
[64]
Be that as it may, the Court affirms the LA's award of proportionate 13th month pay for the year 2013 in favor of Deguidoy, inasmuch as the same award was not questioned by AAI..
WHEREFORE, 
premises considered, the instant petition is hereby 
GRANTED. 
The Decision dated Mach 31,2016, and the Resolution dated November 3, 2016, rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 138334 are 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE. 
 Francia B. Deguidoy is hereby ordered to 
RETURN TO WORK  
within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of  this  Decision.     Automatic  Appliances,  Inc.  is  likewise  ordered  to 
ACCEPT 
Francia B. Deguidoy.
In  addition,  Automatic  Appliances,  Inc.  is  
ORDERED   TO  PAY 
Francia B. Deguidoy her proportionate   13th month pay for the year 2013.
