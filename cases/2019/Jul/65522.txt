DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION,

 PETITIONER, VS. RIZAL TEACHERS KILUSANG BAYAN FOR CREDIT, INC., REPRESENTED BY TOMAS L. ODULLO, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case
May the Department of Education (DepEd) be compelled by writ of mandamus to collect, by salary deductions, the loan payments of public school teachers and remit them to the Rizal Teachers Kilusang Bayan for Credit, Inc. (RTKBCI)?
This petition for review assails the 
Decision 
dated May 30, 2012 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 106515 entitled 
"Rizal Teachers Kilusang Bayan for Credit, Inc., represented by Tomas L. Odullo 
v. 
Department of Education, Hon. Secretary Raul S. Roco and Undersecretary Ernesto S. Pangan" 
which affirmed, in the main, the 
Decision
[3]
 dated January 23, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)-Branch 19, Manila in Civil Case No. 01-102346 granting the writ of mandamus prayed for therein directing DepEd and its responsible offices or divisions to release to RTKBCI the amount of P111,989,006.98 representing the loan payments of public school teachers and to continue implementing the payroll deduction scheme on RTKBCI's behalf until the loans would have been fully paid.
Antecedents
For the benefit of public school teachers, DepEd devised and implemented a payroll deduction scheme for the loans they secured from DepEd's duly accredited private lenders. RTKBCI was among DepEd's accredited private lenders which availed of the latter's payroll deduction scheme. To facilitate DepEd's collections and remittances, RTKBCI was assigned Deduction Codes 209 and 219. DepEd was also paid two percent of the total monthly deductions as administrative fees.
By Memorandum dated July 4, 2001, DepEd Undersecretary Ernesto S. Pangan directed Dr. Blanquita D. Bautista, Chief Accountant and Officer-in-Charge, Finance and Management Service to hold the remittance of the collections for February to June 2001; and suspend as well the salary deduction scheme for RTKBCI pending resolution of the teachers' numerous complaints against RTKBCI's alleged unauthorized excessive deductions and connivance with some DepEd's personnel in charge of effecting these deductions.

If you would only spare a little of your time to look into the attached Statement of Account herewith, you will maybe agree with me, Your Honor, that RTKB had done enormous injustice to the three of us, because of the exorbitant penalties and interests they charged against my loan in not so long interval from the moment I transferred station to the time they deducted my co-makers(') payments. Besides, I barely received a net proceeds of P15,000.00 from my P22,000.00 loan through their agent. With the sum that I already paid them and the sum paid by my co-makers, it clearly appeared that my loan is already overpaid.

I feel desperate about the situation because Mrs. Rono is asking me to pay her immediately the sum of P30,000.00 plus. I don't know where to get the money to pay her.

Dear Sir,
Good day. I would like to inform you about my deductions in RTKBC.
Last Jan. 6, 1997 I have a loan. My loan was P20,000.00 but the cash given me was only P16,000.00.
My payments were begun/started last Dec. 1997 amounting P334.00, then April 1998 to May 1999 P889.00, then June 1999 and July P2,224.00, Aug to March 2000 P2,524.00, then April 2000 P1,635, until now I have a deduction of P3,323.00 Jan. 2001 to July 2001, so how many all in all. It amounts of P62,316.00.
Kaya wala nang katapusan and deduction kong ito bakit kaya, may balance pa raw ako na P20,000.00. Sobra na sila sa ginagawa nila sa akin, sila na nga ang nakikinabang sa aking sahod lahat na lang sa kanila.

Responding to Undersecretary Pangan's directive, RTKBCI wrote
[5]
 the former demanding the release of the collections. By letter dated September 12, 2001, Undersecretary Pangan denied
[6]
 the demand. He asserted that the suspension of the salary deduction scheme was necessary to protect the concerned public school teachers.
Proceedings before the Trial Court
On November 29, 2001, RTKBCI filed with RTC-Manila the petition for mandamus
[7]
 to compel DepEd and then Secretary Raul Roco and Undersecretary Pangan to remit to RTKBCI the loan collections and continue with the salary deduction scheme until the loans of the public school teachers should have been fully paid. The petition was raffled to Branch 19.
RTKBCI claimed it was among DepEd's accredited lending agencies and had a standing arrangement with the latter to avail of the payroll deduction scheme under Codes 209 and 219. Section 36 of RA 8760, 
General Appropriations Act of 2000, 
authorizing agencies and offices with existing deduction arrangements with private lenders to continue the same until the teachers' loans should have been fully paid.
The petition also sought actual damages of P5,000,000.00 and P500,000.00 for attorney's fees.
[8]
Meantime, then Secretary Roco and Undersecretary Pangan resigned from their respective posts. DepEd manifested that these officials were replaced by then Secretary Edilberto C. De Jesus and Undersecretary Juan Miguel M. Luz. On August 13, 2004, the trial court ordered the substitution of parties-respondents in the case title but no action was made to implement it. Hence, as stated, the Court has 
motu proprio 
dropped Secretary Roco and Undersecretary Pangan as respondents and retained DepEd as the only party-respondent in the case title.
RTKBCI presented as its lone witness its consultant and liaison officer William G. Hernandez. He testified that DepEd acted arbitrarily and without due notice when it refused to remit the collections it had and eventually stopped the payroll deduction scheme in RTKBCI's favor.
[9]
The Trial Court's Ruling
By 
Decision 
dated January 23, 2008,
[10]
 the trial court granted the writ of mandamus prayed for and ordered DepEd to release to RTKBCI the collections amounting to P111,989,006.98. DepEd was also ordered to pay actual damages of P5,000,000.00 and attorney's fees of P500,000.00.
The Court of Appeals' Ruling
On DepEd's appeal, the Court of Appeals, under 
Decision 
dated May 30, 2012, affirmed in the main, but deleted the award of actual damages:
WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision dated January 23, 2008 of the RTC, Branch 19, City of Manila is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION to read, as follows:
WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of petitioner Rizal Teachers Kilusang Bayan for Credit, Inc. and against respondents Department of Education and its responsible officers/division. Accordingly, let a writ of mandamus issue, ordering said respondents to release in favor of petitioner the amount of P111,989,006.98, representing withheld remittances and to allow petitioner to proceed with its deductions under the payroll deductions scheme until the sums due as payment of the loans to petitioner are satisfied. Further, respondents are ordered to pay petitioner the amount of P500,000.00 as attorney's fees.
SO ORDERED.
The Court of Appeals sustained the alleged clear legal right of RTKBCI to receive the payments which DepEd had already collected through the payroll deduction scheme. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the payroll deduction scheme started as a privilege but became a property right of RTKBCI after DepEd authorized RTKBCI to avail of the scheme and actually collected the payments for RTKBCI's account.
The Present Petition
Petitioner DepEd now invokes the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction to review and reverse the Decision dated May 30, 2012 of the Court of Appeals. We present below the parties' conflicting arguments, 
viz:
 
 
 DepEd 
 
 RTKBCI 
 
 
 
1. DepEd's payroll deduction scheme is prohibited by law and contrary to the welfare of public school teachers. Hence, the writ of mandamus does not lie to compel DepEd to provide the relief sought by RTKBCI.
 
2. RTKBCI's accreditation by DepEd as a lending agency for public school teachers and its enrolment in DepEd's payroll deduction scheme under Deduction Code Nos. 209 and 219 do not create a clear legal property right in favor of RTKBCI and a clear legal duty on DepEd to recognize and enforce such alleged right.
 
3. DepEd has already refunded the amounts collected as loan payments from concerned public school teachers to the latter.
 
4. The numerous complaints by affected public school teachers against RTKBCI's alleged unauthorized or over-deductions rendered RTKBCI without any clear legal right to seek relief from and under DepEd's payroll deduction scheme.
 
1. The continuous implementation of the payroll deduction scheme onformed with Section 36, RA 8760 (GAA FY 2000) and RA 4760, both authorizing government offices to continue with their existing salary deduction scheme with private lenders until all outstanding loans or policy premiums would have been paid. DepEd violated these statutes when it suspended the salary deduction scheme despite their clear directives to carry one with such scheme.
 
2. After DepEd itself granted accreditation to RTKBCI to collect payment through payroll deduction and charged 2% of the monthly collections as administrative fees, the former should be deemed estopped from asserting that it was a prohibited arrangement.
 
3. Although as a rule a writ of mandamus will not lie to compel the performance of an act involving the exercise of discretion, the exception is when there is grave abuse of discretion or when manifest injustice or palpable excess of authority will cause a petitioner to lose the right he or she is entitled to. In this case, the exception exists because DepEd unilaterally deprived RTKBCI of its property right arising from RTKBCI's loan transactions with concerned public school teachers.
 
 
The parties both agree that the collection and remittance of the payments may only be authorized by law. Their arguments, though hinge on the interpretation of laws and regulations, if any, pertaining to the payroll deduction scheme.
Core Issue
May DepEd, by writ of mandamus, be compelled to continue to collect and remit on RTKBCI's behalf loan payments from public school teachers?
Ruling
We first reckon with the rules governing the writ of mandamus:
One
. 
For the writ of mandamus to prosper, the applicant must prove by preponderance of evidence that "there is a clear legal duty imposed upon the office or the officer sought to be compelled to perform an act, and when the party seeking mandamus has a clear legal right to the performance of such act."
[11]
 As explained in 
Pacheco v. Court of Appeals:
[12]
Mandamus lies to compel the performance of a clear legal duty or a ministerial duty imposed by law upon the defendant or respondent to perform the act required that the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from office, trust or station. A clear legal right is one that is founded or granted by law. Unless the right to relief is clear, mandamus will not issue. If there is any discretion as to the taking or non-taking of the action sought, there is no clear legal duty.
Padilla v. Congress, et al
.,
[13]
 emphasized that "[m]andamus never issues in doubtful cases. While it may not be necessary that the ministerial duty be absolutely expressed, it must however, be clear. The writ neither confers powers nor imposes duties. It is simply a command to exercise a power already possessed and to perform a duty already imposed."
Further, 
Umali v. Judicial and Bar Council
[14]
 distinguished a ministerial act from a discretionary act, 
viz: 
"A purely ministerial act is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. On the other hand, if the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment. Clearly, the use of discretion and the performance of a ministerial act are mutually exclusive."
Conversely, mandamus will not compel a public official to do anything which is not his or her duty or otherwise give the applicant anything to which he or she is not entitled to under the law.
[15]
Here, RTKBCI must prove that a law or regulation compels DepEd to continue as RTKBCI's collecting and remitting agent for the loans the latter extended to public school teachers and that RTKBCI is, by such law or regulations, entitled to the collection and remittance of these payments.

 General Provisions, Section 47. Authorized Deductions (General Appropriations Act for FY 2017) which states that "Deductions from salaries and other benefits accruing to any government employee, chargeable against the appropriations for Personnel Services, may be allowed for the payment of an individual employee's contributions or obligations due the following, and in the order of preference stated below:
The BIR, PHILHEALTH, GSIS and HDMF;
Non-stock savings and loan associations and mutual benefits associations duly operating under existing laws and cooperatives which are managed by and/or for the benefit of the government employees;
Associations or provident funds organized and managed by government employees for their benefit and welfare;

Section 7 of RA 9155 
(Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001) 
sets forth the power, duties and functions of DepEcl and the different levels of supervision and regulation of educational activities.
[23]
 Notably, DepEd's activities as collection and remittance agent for accredited private lending institutions are not among its core power, duties, and functions.
Five
.
 A 
General Appropriations Act 
such as RA 8760 would automatically lapse at the end of such fiscal year for which it has been enacted by operation of law.
[24]
Gauged by the foregoing rules, RTKBCI 
has failed to prove 
that a writ of mandamus is the appropriate legal remedy to compel DepEd as a matter of legal obligation to collect and remit on its behalf payments from concerned public school teachers. Consider:
First
.
 It is true that DepEd can no longer argue that it is powerless to institute a payroll deduction scheme for accredited private lending institutions. The reason is DepEd's continuous interpretation of statutes that it has the power to do so not only as a privilege and accommodation to private lending institutions but also as a scheme to protect and promote the teachers' welfare.
DepEd, nonetheless, has no legal duty to act as a collecting and remitting agent for RTKBCI. The latter has not shown that it remains an accredited private lending institution entitled to avail of the payroll deduction system. Assuming that RTKBCI is still DepEd accredited, DepEd is not precluded from suspending its activities under the payroll deduction scheme 
vis-Ã -vis 
a private lending agency such as RTKBCI. The payroll deduction scheme expressly describes the services it offers as a privilege. As such, DepEd may act as a collecting and remitting agent for a private lending agency, but doing so must always be in consonance with DepEd's power, duties, and functions under Section 7 of RA 9155.
RTKBCI has no clear legal right to demand that DepEd act as its collecting and remitting agent. To reiterate, this is not one of DepEd's power, duties, and functions. Rather, it is an accommodation that DepEd does - - - not for the benefit of any private lending agency but as a means to protect and promote the teachers' welfare. Hence, the only feasible characterization of this activity its being a mere privilege. To otherwise characterize this activity is to demean and degrade the stature of DepEd as the sovereign regulator and supervisor of basic education and to reduce it to being a mere collection and remittance agency for private lending institutions.
Further, a dubious case is antithetical to the requirement of a clear legal right in mandamus cases. Here, there have been unresolved complaints against RTKBCI for overpayments, excessive deductions and even connivance between RTKBCI and DepEds' own personnel in charge of implementing the salary deduction scheme. DepEd had also long decided to return the collected payments to the teachers concerned. These two circumstances, therefore, make RTKBCI's demand no longer feasible in terms of clarity and exactness of the right and the practicability of its recognition and enforcement.
Second
. 
Neither estoppel nor practice engenders a clear legal duty for DepEd to act as RTKBCI's collection and remittance agent.
As held in 
PeÃ±a v. Delos Santos,
[25]
 "[e]stoppel is a principle in equity and pursuant to Article 1432, 
Civil Code, 
it is adopted insofar as it is not in conflict with the provisions of the 
Civil Code 
and other laws." Estoppel, thus, cannot supplant and contravene the provision of law clearly applicable to a case, and conversely, it cannot give validity to an act that is prohibited by law or one that is against public policy.
[26]
DepEd cannot be held in estoppel to ascribe upon it a clear legal duty to act in situations where the paramount consideration mandated DepEd to protect and promote of the teachers' welfare in accordance with its power, duties, and functions under Section 7, RA 9155. It is both against law and public policy to uphold the collection and remittance accommodation afforded to private lending institutions when to do so was and would be prejudicial to its express mandate under RA 9155 to protect and promote the teachers' welfare.
In any event, RTKBCI is hard-pressed to establish the essential elements of estoppel. In relation to the party sought to be estopped, these are: 1) a clear conduct amounting to false representation or concealment of material facts or, at least, calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; 2) an intent or, at least, an expectation, that this conduct shall influence, or be acted upon by, the other party; and 3) the knowledge, actual or constructive, by him of the real facts.
[27]
 With respect to the party claiming estoppel, the conditions he or she must satisfy are: 1) lack of knowledge or of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; 2) reliance, in good faith, upon the conduct or statements of the party to be estopped; and 3) action or inaction based thereon of such character as to change his position or status calculated to cause him injury or prejudice.
[28]
It has not been shown that DepEd intended to conceal the actual facts concerning the nature of its role as a collection and remittance agent of RTKBCI as a privilege and as an accommodation to the latter on one hand, and a protective and promotive mechanism for the welfare of teachers, on the other. More important, RTKBCI has been shown not to be totally unaware of the aforementioned nature of DepEd's role and its primary responsibility to teachers, among other stakeholders, and only secondarily and subsidiarily to private lending institutions such as RTKBCI.
Continued practice in domestic legal matters does not rise to the level of a legal obligation. The first sentence of Article 7 of the 
Civil Code 
states, "[l]aws are repealed only by subsequent ones, and their violation or non-observance shall not be excused by disuse, or custom or practice to the contrary." There can be no clear legal duty and clear legal right where to do so would compel DepEd to violate its power, duties, and functions under Section 7 of RA 9155, specifically toward the protection and promotion of the teachers' welfare. In the latter case, no practice, continued or otherwise, would establish and validate such clear legal duty and clear legal right.
In terms of international law where practice could give rise to a legally binding rule, 
Bayan Muna v. Romulo
[29]
 explained:
Customary international law or international custom is a source of international law as stated in the Statute of the ICJ. It is defined as the "general and consistent practice of states recognized and followed by them from a sense of legal obligation. In order to establish the customary status of a particular norm, two elements must concur: State practice, the objective element; and opinio juris sive necessitates, the subjective element.
State practice refers to the continuous repetition of the same or similar kind of acts or norms by States. It is demonstrated upon the existence of the following elements: (1) generality; (2) uniformity and consistency; and (3) duration. While, opinio juris, the psychological element, requires that the state practice or norm "be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it."
RTKBCI has failed to show that DepEd's alleged practice of acting as a collector and remitter of loan payments on its behalf was general and consistent, much less, that DepEd did so as a sense of legal obligation. DepEd, on the contrary, has been adamant that it acted as collector and remitter only by way of accommodation and privilege.
Third
.
 RTKBCI cannot rely on Section 36 of RA 8760 to anchor its claim of clear legal duty. As for the GAA FY 2000, by operation of law, it automatically lapsed by the end of such fiscal year.
In the modern world, education is considered a basic human right for it is a powerful tool by which people from socially and economically marginalized countries can be lifted out of poverty. This is the reason behind the State'sÂ» mandate to make education accessible to all its citizens. Its importance cannot be overemphasized and is now in the same league of national concerns as national defense, economic growth, and international relations of the country. Section 5(5),
[30]
 Article XIV of the 
Constitution 
has directed that education be accorded the highest budgetary priority.
The State has also made it part of its national policy to ensure that teachers achieve advancement in their career, for they are, after all, the partners of the State in fulfilling its mandate of providing quality education. The 
Constitution, 
thus, provides:
(4) The State shall enhance the right of teachers to professional advancement. Non-teaching academic and non-academic personnel shall enjoy the protection of the State.
[31]
But professional growth cannot be achieved if teachers are not doing well in their personal lives. The personal and professional well-being of teachers must go hand-in-hand. The State must, therefore, enforce laws, formulate rules and implement programs intended to promote the general interest of teachers. This is in accord with the State's duty to ensure its citizens with dignity, welfare, and security.
Further, teachers have no one else to turn to for protection of their welfare except the State itself. For its part, the State is duty bound to render such protection in observance of its duty under the doctrine of 
parens patriae. Parens patriae 
means parent of his or her country. It refers to the State in its role as "sovereign" or the State in its capacity as a provider of protection to those unable to care for themselves. In fulfilling this duty, the State may resort to the exercise of its inherent powers: police power, eminent domain and power of taxation.
[32]
 In implementing the payroll deduction system, DepEd performed a function only secondarily to favor RTKBCI as a private lending institution and primarily to protect and promote the welfare of teachers and institutions of basic education.
ACCORDINGLY,

The 
Decision 
dated May 30, 2012 of the Court of Appeals
[33]
 in CA-GR. SP No. 106515, entitled 
"Rizal Teachers Kilusang Bayan for Credit, Inc., represented by Tomas L. Odullo 
v. 
Department of Education, Hon. Secretary Raul S. Roco and Undersecretary Ernesto S. Pangan," 
is 
REVERSED 
and 
SET ASIDE, 
and the Complaint for Mandamus and Damages in Civil Case No. 01-102346, 
DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED.
Carpio, (Chairperson), Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa,
 and 
J. Reyes, Jr., JJ.,
 concur.
[1]
 Please note that as early as August 13, 2004, the trial court had already ordered the substitution of former Secretary Raul Roco and former Undersecretary Ernesto Pangan as parties-respondents after they ceased holding the posts. They were to be replaced by then incumbent Secretary Edilberto C. De Jesus and Undersecretary Juan Miguel M. Luz. But the substitutions were not effected. Thus, to avoid the injustice of including these former officials as respondents in their official capacities when they had long ceased to be, this Court has 
motu proprio 
corrected the case title to conform to present circumstances and the presumed intent of both courts below and the parties in the case.

 PROHIBITING PAYMENT OF SALARY TO PERSONS OTHER THAN THE EMPLOYEE CONCERNED
To Superintendents:
1. Quoted hereunder is Memorandum Order No. 93 dated February 5, 1968, of the Executive Office entitled "Prohibiting Payment of Salary to Any Person Other Than the Employees Concerned, Except As Provided Herein."
It has been observed that some employees delegate the collection of their salaries to attorneys-in-fact on the strength of powers of attorney or other forms of authority in favor of other persons, evidently in satisfaction of obligations contracted by them. This practice should be discouraged in view of its adverse effects on the efficiency and morale of employees whose incentive to work is necessarily impaired, since their salary or a portion thereof goes to other persons.
To curb this unwholesome practice, it is hereby directed that henceforth no cashier or disbursing officer shall pay to attorneys-in-fact or other persons who may be authorized under a power of attorney or other forms of authority to collect the salary of an employee, except when the persons so designated and authorized is an immediate member of the family of the employee concerned, and in all other cases, except upon proper authorization of the Assistant Executive Secretary for Legal and Administrative Matters, with the recommendation of the Financial Assistant.
All orders or regulations inconsistent herewith are hereby revoked.
This order shall take effect immediately.
2. Accordingly, it is desired that, henceforth, cashiers or disbursing officers pay the salary due any school employee or issue the treasury warrant of any teacher direct to such employee or teacher, except when authority to collect the salary or treasury warrant has been given to another person, and the person so authorized is an immediate member of the family of the employee or teacher concerned.
3. Any previous regulation issued by this Office inconsistent with this Circular is hereby revoked.
 
 
[21]
 
1. 
 
Background. This Office has observed the proliferation of unauthorized lending groups or persons involved in lending activities within the DECS system. Noted also is the collusion between and among some DECS personnel and lending groups, persons, DECS officials and other personnel involved In lending activities to facilitate the collection of the salaries/cheques of teachers and other personnel, in whole or in part, through unauthorized deduction or withholding schemes, evidently in satisfaction of obligations contracted with them. These activities have reduced some of our personnel to collection agents who are given certain percentage for the Job, and denigrated the efficiency and morale of our teachers and other personnel, especially those in the field offices. Time and again, this particular problem has cropped up and this Department has consistently addressed the problem and maintained its stand against these practices.
 
 
 
 
2.
 
Policy Statement. In view thereof and in line with our commitment to stop graft and corrupt practices and to bring back the dignity of teachers, the Department establishes its policy against all forms of unauthorized salary deductions, withholding of checks and lending activities within the DECS system. It shall provide guidelines on the release of the cheques/salaries of teachers and other personnel as herein set forth.
 
 
 
 
3.
 
Prohibitions. Henceforth, the Department promulgates the following prohibitions against Its officials and other personnel, to wit:
 
 
 
 
 
a.
 
No lending activities in any form shall be allowed within the DECS system in all levels unless authorized by law or by the Secretary; 
 
 
 
 
 
b.
 
No person shall make any deduction whatsoever from the salaries, cheques of teachers and other personnel except under specific authority of law authorizing such deductions provided, however, that upon written authority executed by the teacher concerned, lawful dues and fees owing to the Philippine Public School Teachers Association, Teachers' Cooperatives of which they are members, and premiums properly due on insurance policies, shall be deductible;
 
 
 
 
 
c.
 
No DECS officials or personnel shall introduce, operate, support or abet, directly or indirectly, any form of lending activities within the DECS system;
 
 
[22]
