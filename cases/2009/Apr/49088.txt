PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND PHOTOKINA MARKETING CORPORATION, PETITIONERS, VS. ALFREDO L. BENIPAYO, RESPONDENT.
[G.R. NO. 155573]
 PHOTOKINA MARKETING CORPORATION, PETITIONER,  VS. ALFREDO L. BENIPAYO, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




NACHURA, J.:


Before the Court are two consolidated petitions for review on 
certiorari
 filed under Rules 45 and 122 of the Rules of Court: (1) G.R. No. 154473 assailing the June 18, 2002
[1]
 and the June 23, 2002
[2]
 Orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 102 in Criminal Case No. Q-02-109407; and (2) G.R. No. 155573 challenging the June 25, 2002
[3]
 and the September 18, 2002
[4]
 Orders of the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 101 in Criminal Case No. Q-02-109406.
The petitions, while involving the same issues, rest on different factual settings, thus:
G.R. No. 154473
On January 31, 2002, respondent Alfredo L. Benipayo, then Chairman of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), delivered a speech in the "Forum on Electoral Problems: Roots and Responses in the Philippines" held at the Balay Kalinaw, University of the Philippines-Diliman Campus, Quezon City.
[5]
 The speech was subsequently published in the February 4 and 5, 2002 issues of the Manila Bulletin.
[6]
Petitioner corporation, believing that it was the one alluded to by the respondent when he stated in his speech that
Even worse, the Commission came right up to the brink of signing a 6.5 billion contract for a registration solution that could have been bought for 350 million pesos, and an ID solution that isn't even a requirement for voting.  But reason intervened and no contract was signed.  
Now, they are at it again, trying to hoodwink us into contract that is so grossly disadvantageous to the government that it offends common sense to say that it would be worth the 6.5 billion-peso price tag
.
[7]
filed, through its authorized representative, an Affidavit-Complaint
[8]
 for libel.
Arguing that he was an impeachable officer, respondent questioned the jurisdiction of the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City (OCP-QC).
[9]
 Despite the challenge, the City Prosecutor filed an Information
[10]
 for libel against the respondent, docketed as Criminal Case No. Q-02-109407, with the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 102.
Petitioner later filed a Motion for Inhibition and Consolidation,
[11]
 contending that Judge Jaime N. Salazar of Branch 102 could not impartially preside over the case because his appointment to the judiciary was made possible through the recommendation of respondent's father-in-law. Petitioner further moved that the case be ordered consolidated with the other libel case [Criminal Case No. Q-02-103406, which is the subject of G.R. No. 155573] pending with Branch 101 of the RTC.
While the said motion remained unresolved, respondent, for his part, moved for the dismissal of the case on the assertion that the trial court had no jurisdiction over his person for he was an impeachable officer and thus, could not be criminally prosecuted before any court during his incumbency; and that, assuming he can be criminally prosecuted, it was the Office of the Ombudsman that should investigate him and the case should be filed with the Sandiganbayan.
[12]
On June 18, 2002, the trial court issued the challenged Order
[13]
 dismissing Criminal Case No. Q-02-109407 and considering as moot and academic petitioner's motion to inhibit. While the RTC found that respondent was no longer an impeachable officer because his appointment was not confirmed by Congress, it ruled that the case had to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction considering that the alleged libel was committed by respondent in relation to his office--he delivered the speech in his official capacity as COMELEC Chair. Accordingly, it was the Sandiganbayan that had jurisdiction over the case to the exclusion of all other courts.
On motion for reconsideration, the trial court adhered to its ruling that it was not vested with jurisdiction to hear the libel case.
[14]
Aggrieved, petitioners timely filed before the Court, on pure questions of law, the instant Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[15]
 under Rule 122 in relation to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court raising the following grounds:
THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE FIRST RESOLVED THE MOTION TO INHIBIT BEFORE RESOLVING THE MOTION TO DISMISS;
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE CRIME OF LIBEL IN THIS CASE WAS COMMITTED BY ACCUSED "IN RELATION TO HIS OFFICE;" AND
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT IT HAD NO JURISDICTION IN THIS CASE.
[16]
G.R. No. 155573
On March 13, 2002, respondent, as COMELEC Chair, and COMELEC Commissioner Luzviminda Tangcangco were guests of the talk show "Point Blank," hosted by Ces Drilon and televised nationwide on the ANC-23 channel. The television show's episode that day was entitled "COMELEC Wars."
[17]
 In that episode, the following conversation transpired:
Drilon: Are you saying, Chairman, that COMELEC funds are being used for a "PR" campaign against you? Is that what you are saying?
Benipayo: No, I think [it's] not COMELEC funds, [it's] Photokina funds. You know, admittedly, according to [c]hargÃ© d'[a]ffaires of the U.S. Embassy[,] in a letter sent to me in July of 2001, it is what's been [so] happening to the Photokina deal, they have already spent in excess of 2.4 [m]illion U.S. [d]ollars. At that time[,] that's about 120 [m]illion pesos and I said, what for[?] [T]hey wouldn't tell me, you see. Now you asked me, [who is] funding this? I think it's pretty obvious.
[18]
Petitioner considered respondent's statement as defamatory, and, through its authorized representative, filed a Complaint-Affidavit
[19]
 for libel. Respondent similarly questioned the jurisdiction of the OCP-QC.
[20]
 The City Prosecutor, however, consequently instituted Criminal Case No. Q-02-109406 by filing the corresponding Information
[21]
 with the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 101.
Respondent also moved for the dismissal of the information raising similar arguments that the court had no jurisdiction over his person, he being an impeachable officer; and that, even if criminal prosecution were possible, jurisdiction rested with the Sandiganbayan.
[22]
On June 25, 2002, the trial court issued the assailed Order
[23]
 dismissing Criminal Case No. Q-02-109406 for lack of jurisdiction over the person of the respondent. The RTC, in the further assailed September 18, 2002 Order,
[24]
 denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.
[25]
Displeased with the rulings of the trial court, petitioners seasonably filed before this Court, on pure questions of law, another Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[26]
 under Rule 122 in relation to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court raising the following grounds:
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE CRIME OF LIBEL IN THIS CASE WAS COMMITTED BY RESPONDENT "IN RELATION TO HIS OFFICE"; AND
IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY ALLEGATION IN THE INFORMATION THAT THE CRIME OF LIBEL WAS COMMITTED BY RESPONDENT IN RELATION TO HIS OFFICE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT IT HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE BELOW.
EVEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SANDIGANBAYAN HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE, THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE ENDORSED THE CASE TO THE SANDIGANBAYAN INSTEAD OF DISMISSING IT OUTRIGHT.
[27]
Considering that the two petitions, as aforesaid, involve the same issues and the same parties, the Court, upon the recommendation of the Clerk of Court,
[28]
 consolidated the cases.
[29]
The core issue for the resolution of the Court in these twin cases is whether the RTC has jurisdiction over libel cases to the exclusion of all other courts.
The Ruling of the Court
The Court observes that the parties have argued at length in their pleadings on the issue of whether the alleged criminal acts of respondent are committed in relation to his office. They are of the conviction that the resolution of the said question will ultimately determine which court--the RTC or the Sandiganbayan--has jurisdiction over the criminal cases filed. The Court, however, notes that both parties are working on a wrong premise. The foremost concern, which the parties, and even the trial court, failed to identify, is whether, under our current laws, jurisdiction over libel cases, or written defamations to be more specific, is shared by the RTC with the Sandiganbayan. Indeed, if the said courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction to try the offense, it would be pointless to still determine whether the crime is committed in relation to office.
Uniformly applied is the familiar rule that the jurisdiction of the court to hear and decide a case is conferred by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action, unless a latter statute provides for a retroactive application thereof.
[30]
 Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC),
[31]
 as amended by Republic Act No. 4363,
[32]
 is explicit on which court has jurisdiction to try cases of written defamations, thus:
The 
criminal and civil action for damages in cases of written defamations
 as provided for in this chapter, 
shall be filed simultaneously or separately with the 
court of first instance
 [now, the Regional Trial Court] of the province or city where the libelous article is printed and first published or where any of the offended parties actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense xxx.
[33]
 [Underscoring and italics ours.]
More than three decades ago, the Court, in 
Jalandoni v. Endaya
,
[34]
 acknowledged the unmistakable import of the said provision:
There is no need to make mention again that it is a court of first instance [now, the Regional Trial Court] that is specifically designated to try a libel case. Its language is categorical; its meaning is free from doubt. This is one of those statutory provisions that leave no room for interpretation. All that is required is application. What the law ordains must then be followed.
[35]
This exclusive and original jurisdiction of the RTC over written defamations is echoed in 
Bocobo v. Estanislao
,
[36]
 where the Court further declared that jurisdiction remains with the trial court even if the libelous act is committed "by similar means,"
[37]
 and despite the fact that the phrase "by similar means" is not repeated in the latter portion of Article 360.
[38]
 In these cases, and in those that followed, the Court had been unwavering in its pronouncement that the expanded jurisdiction of the municipal trial courts cannot be exercised over libel cases. Thus, in 
Manzano v. Hon. Valera
,
[39]
 we explained at length that:
The applicable law is still Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code, which categorically provides that jurisdiction over libel cases [is] lodged with the Courts of First Instance (now Regional Trial Courts).
This Court already had the opportunity to rule on the matter in G.R. No. 123263, 
People vs. MTC of Quezon City, Branch 32 and Isah v. Red
 wherein a similar question of jurisdiction over libel was raised.  In that case, the MTC judge opined that it was the first level courts which had jurisdiction due to the enactment of RA 7691.  Upon elevation of the matter to us, respondent judge's orders were nullified for lack of jurisdiction, as follows:
"WHEREFORE, the petition is granted:  the respondent Court's Orders dated August 14, 1995, September 7, 1995, and October 18, 1995 are declared null and void for having been issued without jurisdiction; and said Court is enjoined from further taking cognizance of and proceeding with Criminal Case No. 43-00548, which it is commanded to remand to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City for proper disposition."
Another case involving the same question was cited as resolving the matter:
"Anent the question of jurisdiction, we ** find no reversible error committed by public respondent Court of Appeals in denying petitioner's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  The contention ** that R.A. 7691 divested the Regional Trial Courts of jurisdiction to try libel cases cannot be sustained.  While libel is punishable by imprisonment of six months and one day to four years and two months (Art. 360, Revised Penal Code) which imposable penalty is lodged within the Municipal Trial Court's jurisdiction under R.A. No. 7691 (Sec. 32 
[2]
), said law however, excludes therefrom ** cases falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts **.  The Court in 
Bocobo vs. Estanislao
, 72 SCRA 520 and 
Jalandoni vs. Endaya
, 55 SCRA 261, correctly cited by the Court of Appeals, has laid down the rule that Regional Trial courts have the exclusive jurisdiction over libel cases, hence, the expanded jurisdiction conferred by R.A. 7691 to inferior courts cannot be applied to libel cases."
Conformably with [these] rulings, we now hold that public respondent committed an error in ordering that the criminal case for libel be tried by the MTC of Bangued.
For, although RA 7691 was enacted to decongest the clogged dockets of the Regional Trail Courts by expanding the jurisdiction of first level courts, said law is of a general character.  Even if it is a later enactment, it does not alter the provision of Article 360 of the RPC, a law of a special nature. "Laws vesting jurisdiction exclusively with a particular court, are special in character, and should prevail over the Judiciary Act defining the jurisdiction of other courts (such as the Court of First Instance) which is a general law." A later enactment like RA 7691 does not automatically override an existing law, because it is a well-settled principle of construction that, in case of conflict between a general law and a special law, the latter must prevail regardless of the dates of their enactment. Jurisdiction conferred by a special law on the RTC must therefore prevail over that granted by a general law on the MTC.
Moreover, from the provisions of R.A. 7691, there seems to be no manifest intent to repeal or alter the jurisdiction in libel cases.  If there was such intent, then the amending law should have clearly so indicated because implied repeals are not favored.  As much as possible, effect must be given to all enactments of the legislature.  A special law cannot be repealed, amended or altered by a subsequent general law by mere implication. Furthermore, for an implied repeal, a pre-condition must be found, that is, a substantial conflict should exist between the new and prior laws. Absent an express repeal, a subsequent law cannot be construed as repealing a prior one unless an irreconcilable inconsistency or repugnancy exists in the terms of the new and old laws. The two laws, in brief, must be absolutely incompatible. In the law which broadened the jurisdiction of the first level courts, there is no absolute prohibition barring Regional Trial Courts from taking cognizance of certain cases over which they have been priorly granted special and exclusive jurisdiction.  Such grant of the RTC (previously CFI) was categorically contained in the first sentence of the amended Sec. 32 of B.P. 129. The inconsistency referred to in Section 6 of RA 7691, therefore, does not apply to cases of criminal libel.
Lastly, in Administrative Order No. 104-96 issued 21 October 1996, this Court delineated the proper jurisdiction over libel cases, hence settled the matter with finality:
"RE:  DESIGNATION OF SPECIAL COURTS FOR KIDNAPPING, ROBBERY, CARNAPPING, DANGEROUS DRUGS CASES AND OTHER HEINOUS CRIMES; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND 
JURISDICTION IN LIBEL CASES
.
x x x x
C
"
LIBEL CASES SHALL BE TRIED BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS
 HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THEM 
TO THE EXCLUSION
 OF THE METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURTS, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURTS IN CITIES, 
MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURTS
 AND MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT TRIAL COURTS."  (Underscoring supplied)
[40]
As we have constantly held in 
Jalandoni
, 
Bocobo
, 
People v. Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Br. 32
,
[41]
 
Manzano
, and analogous cases, we must, in the same way, declare herein that the law, as it still stands at present, dictates that criminal and civil actions for damages in cases of written defamations shall be filed simultaneously or separately with the RTC 
to the exclusion of all other courts
. A subsequent enactment of a law defining the jurisdiction of other courts cannot simply override, 
in the absence of an express repeal or modification
, the specific provision in the RPC vesting in the RTC, as aforesaid, jurisdiction over defamations in writing or by similar means.
[42]
 
The grant to the Sandiganbayan
[43]
 of jurisdiction over offenses committed in relation to (public) office
, similar to the expansion of the jurisdiction of the MTCs, 
did not divest the RTC of its exclusive and original jurisdiction to try written defamation cases regardless of whether the offense is committed in relation to office
. The broad and general phraseology of Section 4, Presidential Decree No. 1606, as amended by Republic Act No. 8249,
[44]
 cannot be construed to have impliedly repealed, or even simply modified, such exclusive and original jurisdiction of the RTC.
[45]
Since jurisdiction over written defamations exclusively rests in the RTC without qualification, it is unnecessary and futile for the parties to argue on whether the crime is committed in relation to office. Thus, the conclusion reached by the trial court that the respondent committed the alleged libelous acts in relation to his office as former COMELEC chair, and deprives it of jurisdiction to try the case, is, following the above disquisition, gross error. This Court, therefore, orders the reinstatement of Criminal Cases Nos. Q-02-109406 and Q-02-109407 and their remand to the respective Regional Trial Courts for further proceedings.  Having said that, the Court finds unnecessary any further discussion of the other issues raised in the petitions.

 This court was created on June 11, 1978 by the issuance of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1486. On December 10, 1978, P.D. No. 1606 was issued to revise and repeal P.D. No. 1486. Throughout the years, P.D. No. 1606 underwent a series of amendments--on January 14, 1983, by P.D. No. 1860; on March 23, 1983, by P.D. No. 1861; on March 30, 1995, by Republic Act (R.A.)

See De Jesus v. People
, 205 Phil. 663, 670 (1983), in which the Court ruled that the provision of the law stating the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, which is phrased in terms so broad and general, cannot be legitimately construed to vest the said court with exclusive jurisdiction over election offenses committed by public officers in relation to their office. Neither can it be interpreted to impliedly repeal the exclusive and original jurisdiction granted by Section 184 of the Election Code of 1978 to the court of first instance (now, the RTC) to hear and decide all election offenses, without qualification as to the status of the accused.
