In a letter dated October 30, 2009, Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer Atty. Eden T. Candelaria called this Court's attention to what might be an inadvertent minor error in the dispositive portion of our Resolution, specifically on the Training requirement for the Chief of Office, MISO. In particular, the Resolution stated: "32 hours of relevant experience in management and supervision." Atty. Candelaria points out that the word "experience" may have been inadvertently typed instead of "training," which would have been more compatible with the category "Training." If, indeed, such an error was committed, Atty. Candelaria requests the Court to make the necessary correction.
The request is noted and granted.
It has also come to our attention that, in our efforts at maintaining uniformity in the QS, we may have overlooked an important component of the MISO Re-engineering Development Plan (MRDP). As discussed in our September 10, 2009 Resolution, the MISO has an ongoing ICT consultancy project with Indra Sistemas S.A. (INDRA), part of which specifically deals with the creation of the MRDP. Among the concerns studied by INDRA is the staffing pattern of MISO and the QS for each position in the office's plantilla. INDRA recognizes that both lawyers and non-lawyers may apply for the position, and recommends the following QS:
 
 
 
 
 
FOR LAWYERS
 
 
 
FOR NON-LAWYERS
 
 
 
 
 
Education
 
 
 
Bachelor of Laws and 18 MA units in a relevant ICT course or 3 years of relevant ICT experience or 160 hours of ICT training or relevant ICT certification 
 
 
Bachelor's Degree in a relevant ICT course and an MBA or Post Graduate Degree in a Management related course or Bachelor's Degree in a Management-related course and an MBA or Post Graduate Degree in a Management-related course and 18 MA units in a relevant ICT course or 3 years of relevant ICT experience or 160 hours of ICT training or relevant ICT certification 
 
 
 
 
Experience
 
 
 
10 years of supervisory experience (within or outside the Supreme Court) 
 
 
10 years of supervisory experience (within or outside the Supreme Court) 
 
 
 
 
Training
 
 
 
40 hours of relevant training in management and supervision 
 
 
40 hours of relevant ICT training 
 
 
 
 
 
Eligibility
 
 
 RA 1080 (Attorney) 
 
 CSC Professional or IT eligibility 
 
 
 
 
 
 An additional project management certification is proposed for all managerial/supervisory positions to enable them to effectively manage ICT projects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MRDP was approved by this Court in a Resolution dated August 11, 2009. Thus, in order to fully implement the MISO's MRDP, we resolve to adopt INDRA's recommendation for the QS of the MISO Chief of Office position.
