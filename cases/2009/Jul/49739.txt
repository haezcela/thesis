Article 1306 of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides that contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms, and conditions, as they may deem convenient, provided that they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.  A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions, avoid litigation, or put an end to one already commenced.
[3]
  It is an accepted, even desirable and encouraged, practice in courts of law and administrative tribunals.
[4]
A compromise agreement intended to resolve a matter already under litigation is a judicial compromise.  Having judicial mandate and entered as its determination of the controversy, such judicial compromise has the force and effect of a judgment.  It transcends its identity as a mere contract between the parties, as it becomes a judgment that is subject to execution in accordance with the Rules of Court.  Thus, a compromise agreement that has been made and duly approved by the court attains the effect and authority of 
res judicata
, although no execution may be issued unless the agreement receives the approval of the court where the litigation is pending and compliance with the terms of the agreement is decreed.
[5]
Finding the Manifestation to be meritorious, and the Compromise Agreement dated March 17, 2009 to be validly executed and not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy; we therefore, accept and approve the same.
WHEREFORE
, the Manifestation dated June 27, 2009 informing this Court that the parties had already arrived at an agreement to settle their legal controversies and praying for the dismissal of this case is 
GRANTED
.  Judgment is hereby rendered in accordance with the Compromise Agreement dated March 17, 2009.  The instant case is 
DISMISSED
.  No pronouncement as to costs.
SO ORDERED
