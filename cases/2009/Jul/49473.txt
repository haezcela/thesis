COCA-COLA BOTTLERS PHILS., INC., PETITIONER, VS. ALAN M. AGITO, REGOLO S. OCA III, ERNESTO G. ALARIAO, JR., ALFONSO PAA, JR., DEMPSTER P. ONG, URRIQUIA T. ARVIN, GIL H. FRANCISCO AND EDWIN M. GOLEZ, RESPONDENTS.

CHICO-NAZARIO, J.:


In a Decision dated 13 February 2009, the Court denied the petition filed in this case and partially affirmed the Decision dated 19 February 2007 and the Resolution dated 31 August 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 85320, insofar as it found that an employer-employee relationship existed between petitioner Coca-cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. and herein respondents.  However, instead of remanding the case to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for further proceedings as the appellate court had ordered, this Court ordered the petitioner to reinstate respondents without loss of seniority rights and to pay them full back wages from the time their compensation was withheld up to their actual reinstatement.
On 13 April 2009, respondents filed a 
Motion for Clarification and/or Partial Motion for Reconsideration
 wherein it quoted the decretal part of the Decision dated 13 February 2009 and the decisive paragraph that precedes it:
Given that respondents were illegally dismissed by petitioner, they are entitled to reinstatement, full backwages, 
inclusive of allowance
, and 
to their other benefits or the monetary equivalent
 thereof computed from the time their compensations were withheld from them up to the time of their actual reinstatement, as mandated under Article 279 of the Labor Code.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
, the instant Petition is 
DENIED
. The Court 
AFFIRMS WITH MODIFICATION
 the Decision dated 19 February 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR SP NO. 85320. The Court 
DECLARES
 that respondents were illegally dismissed and, accordingly, 
ORDERS
 petitioner to reinstate them without loss of seniority rights, and to pay them full backwages computed from the time their compensation was withheld up to the time of their actual reinstatement. (Underscored by respondents.)
Respondents seek to include in the 
fallo
 of the afore-quoted Decision the words "inclusive of allowance and x x x other benefits or the monetary equivalent thereof," found in the discussion.
This Court finds merit in the respondents' motion for partial reconsideration, since the words "inclusive of allowance and x x x other benefits or the monetary equivalent thereof" are merely descriptive of "full backwages," which this Court had already categorically awarded to respondents after a thorough discussion of the merits of the case.  They do not constitute a new or additional award to respondents.  The inclusion of these words in the dispositive part of the Decision serves only to clarify the same so that in the implementation thereof, none of the rights legally due to the respondents shall be overlooked.
WHEREFORE
, the respondents' 
Motion for Clarification and/or Partial Motion for Reconsideration
 is 
GRANTED
.  The dispositive part of the Decision dated 13 February 2009 is 
MODIFIED
 to read as follows:
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
, the instant Petition is
 DENIED
.  The Court 
AFFIRMS WITH MODIFICATION
 the Decision dated 19 February 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 85320.  The Court 
DECLARES
 that respondents were illegally dismissed and, accordingly, 
ORDERS
 petitioner to reinstate them without loss of seniority rights, and to pay them full backwages, 
inclusive of allowances, and their other benefits or the monetary equivalent
 
thereof
 computed from the time their compensation was withheld up to the time of their actual reinstatement.  Costs against the petitioner.
SO ORDERED.
Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Carpio Morales, Nachura,
 and  
Peralta, JJ., 
concur.
