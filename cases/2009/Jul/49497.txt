CHICO-NAZARIO, J.:


In a Decision dated 28 August 2008, the Court granted the petition for review on 
certiorari
 filed in this case.  The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Orders dated 30 January 2006 and 9 June 2006 of the RTC dismissing Criminal Cases No. 05-3054 to 05-3165 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Let the corresponding Warrants of Arrest issue against herein respondents TERESITA PUIG and ROMEO PORRAS. The RTC Judge of Branch 68, in Dumangas, Iloilo, is directed to proceed with the trial of Criminal Cases No. 05-3054 to 05-3165, inclusive, with reasonable dispatch.  No pronouncement as to costs.

However, on 2 September 2008, the Supreme Court 
En Banc
, instead of ordering the arrest of respondents Teresita Puig and Romeo Porras for purposes of proceeding with the trial of Criminal Cases No. 05-3054 to 05-3165, issued a Warrant of Arrest addressed to the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), commanding them to effectuate the immediate 
arrest
 of herein respondent Teresita Puig only and 
commit 
her to the Correctional Institution for Women in Mandaluyong City.
In light of the 28 August 2008 Decision of this Court and considering that trial on the merits has yet to proceed, the Warrant of Arrest ordering the 
arrest
 and 
commitment
 of respondent Teresita Puig to the Correctional Institution is hereby 
recalled
.
ACCORDINGLY
, a new 
WARRANT of ARREST
 is hereby entered commanding the Director of the NBI and the PNP Chief to immediately 
ARREST
, for the purpose of further proceedings (trial on the merits) in Criminal Cases No. 05-3054 to No. 05-3165, both respondents TERESITA PUIG and ROMEO PORRAS whose known address is Poblacion, Pototan, Iloilo, or anywhere in the Republic of the Philippines.  
FURTHER
, the said officials are both 
DIRECTED
 to 
SUBMIT
 a report within ten (10) days from compliance herewith.
SO ORDERED.
Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro,

Peralta, JJ.,
