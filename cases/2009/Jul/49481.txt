NACHURA, J.:


This resolves the Motion for Reconsideration
[1]
 filed by petitioners on January 29, 2009 from the Resolution
[2]
 of this Court dated November 17, 2008 dismissing for lack of merit the petition for 
certiorari
 with prayer for preliminary injunction and restraining order. Petitioners filed a Rule 65 petition assailing the Joint Orders dated September 29, 2008 issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) which denied the two motions for postponement and motion to remand interposed by petitioners in I.S. No. 2008-650, I.S. No. 2008-117, I.S. No. 2008-152, and I.S. No. 154.
Aside from its lack of merit, the petition for 
certiorari
 was also dismissed for failure to state the material dates on the receipt of the assailed joint orders, contrary to Section 4, Rule 65 in relation to the second paragraph of Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court. The petition also lacked legible duplicate original or certified true copies of the assailed orders, in violation of  the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 65  and Section 3, Rule 46 in relation to Section 2, Rule 56.
[3]
We find no cogent reason to warrant a reconsideration of this Court's resolution.
A petition for 
certiorari
 is an extraordinary remedy.
[4]
 As such, the party who seeks to avail of the same must strictly observe the procedural rules laid down by law,
[5]
 and non-observance thereof may not be brushed aside as mere technicality.
[6]
 The decision on whether or not to accept a petition for 
certiorari
, as well as to grant due course thereto, is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the court.
[7]
While there may have been exceptional cases where this Court has set aside procedural defects to correct patent injustice concomitant to the liberal interpretation of the rules, we find such reason lacking in the case at bar.
Likewise, petitioners failed to observe the rule on hierarchy of courts when they directly sought relief before this Court. In 
Talento v. Escalada
,
[8]
 we explained:
Although the Supreme Court, Regional Trial Courts, and the Court of Appeals have concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of 
certiorari
, prohibition, 
mandamus
, 
quo warranto
, 
habeas corpus
 and injunction, such concurrence does not give the petitioner unrestricted freedom of choice of court forum. Recourse should have been made first with the Court of Appeals and not directly to this Court.
[9]
True, we had, on certain occasions, entertained direct recourse to this Court as an exception to the rule on hierarchy of courts. In those exceptional cases, however, we recognized an exception because it was dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice, or the orders complained of were found to be patent nullities, or the appeal was considered as clearly an inappropriate remedy.
[10]
In the instant case, however, the questions raised are issues evidently within the normal precincts of an appeal which cannot be peremptorily addressed by an extraordinary writ. In fact, the Court of Appeals (CA) has jurisdiction to review the resolution issued by the Secretary of the DOJ through a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court albeit solely on the ground that the Secretary of Justice committed grave abuse of his discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction.
[11]
 Petitioners could have easily availed themselves of such recourse instead of directly assailing the same before this Court.
The Supreme Court is a court of last resort, and must so remain if it is to satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the fundamental charter and immemorial tradition.
[12]
 A direct invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction to issue said writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. This is established policy - a policy that is necessary to prevent inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction, and to prevent further over-crowding of the Court's docket.
[13]
