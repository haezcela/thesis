RE: FURTHER CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SET-UP OF THE PHILIPPINE JUDICIAL ACADEMY. 
R E S O L U T I O N




PERALTA, J.:


The present administrative matter arose from a letter dated June 17, 2009 of Justice Adolfo S. Azcuna, Chancellor of the Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA), addressed to Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, Chairperson of the PHILJA Board of Trustees, requesting the Court's approval of the following amendments in the PHILJA's staffing pattern, solely referring to the Chancellor's Office.  Thus:
We refer your Honor to the Court 
En Banc
 Resolution dated 23 September 2008, in Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA, (
Further Clarifying and Strengthening the Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-up of the Philippine Judicial Academy
), which approved PHILJA's staffing pattern, hereto attached as Annex "A."
In reference to the abovementioned Resolution, may we respectfully request the Court's approval of the following amendments solely referring to the Chancellor's Office.
1) To convert the position of 
PHILJA Attorney VI
, salary grade 27, to 
Judicial Staff Head
 with the same salary grade 27, and change it from permanent to coterminous.
The conversion of the position will accord the Chancellor the discretion to hire a non-lawyer for the position when necessary.
2) To revert the status of the following positions from permanent to coterminous:
SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer  SG 25 Judicial Staff Officer III  SG 18 Records Officer II  SG 14 Judicial Staff Assistant III SG 10
Under the Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA, the status of the above-mentioned positions were changed from coterminous to permanent status.
In view of the nature of work required by the Chancellor for the staff under the Office of the Chancellor, there is a need to appoint such personnel of trust and confidence of the Chancellor.
May we respectfully request that the permanent status of these positions be reverted to coterminous status.
For the Chief Justice's consideration and approval.
[1]
In the Resolution dated June 23, 2009, the Court referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Services for comment thereon within ten (10) days from notice thereof.
In a Memorandum

COMMENTS/OBSERVATIONS:
It may be stated that the results of the study made on the old plantillas of the PHILJA showed that there is a need for permanent positions in the Executive Offices (Offices of the PHILJA Chancellor, PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary) for purposes of continuity of workflow insofar as the records management therein is concerned.
We believe that the request of Justice Azcuna to convert the position of Court Attorney VI [
should be 
PHILJA Attorney VI] (SG 27) in his Office is meritorious in order to give his Honor the discretion to hire a non-lawyer when necessary.  However, with due respect to him, we cannot favorably recommend its conversion as Judicial Staff Head with the same Salary Grade of 27, primarily because the position of Judicial Staff Head is exclusively used only in the Offices of the Justices; and, secondly, per the Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the position of Judicial Staff Head has an assigned Salary Grade of 28, not Salary Grade 27.
As an alternative, we propose that the position of PHILJA Attorney VI in the Office of the Chancellor be converted and/or reclassified as PHILJA Head Executive Assistant with the same Salary Grade 27 as that of Court Attorney VI.
As regards the second request of Justice Azcuna, we propose the reversion of the status of the permanent positions in his Office to coterminous except, however, to the position of Records Officer II which we proposed to be retained as permanent in order that there would be continuity of the smooth operations in the office should there be a chance of a new administration.  All of the four (4) subject positions have existing funds.
Meanwhile, we believe that the restructuring of the Office of the Chancellor might as well affect the hierarchy of positions in the Offices of the Vice-Chancellor and Executive Secretary. Hence, with due respect also to Honorables Justo P. Torres and Marina L. Buzon, PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary, respectively, we propose that some changes be likewise made in their respective plantillas.
Shown below are the plantillas of the Offices of the PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary pursuant to the Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA:

We propose that the following positions in their respective plantillas be likewise converted and/or reclassified, to wit:

 Office of the Executive Secretary 
 
 PHILJA Attorney IV 
 
 25 
 
 PHILJA Executive Assistant VI

and that all the positions therein be reverted as coterminous for the same reason of maintaining the hierarchy of positions in the Executive Offices in the PHILJA, except that of Clerk III (SG 6) in the aforesaid Offices which we propose to be retained as permanent.  Moreover, except for Clerk III position, it would be logical to have the other positions coterminous since the Vice-Chancellor and the Executive Secretary serve only for a specific period of two (2) years.
Verification from the plantillas of the PHILJA Executive Officials shows that the aforesaid three (3) positions which we propose for conversion and/or reclassification (
i.e.
, PHILJA Attorney VI, PHILJA Attorney V, and PHILJA Attorney IV) are still unfilled, hence, no incumbent will be affected by the proposed conversion and/or reclassification thereof.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
In light of the foregoing, we respectfully recommend the following:
1.  the conversion and/or reclassification of the position of Court Attorney VI [
should be 
PHILJA Attorney VI] (SG 27) in the Office of the Chancellor and to retain its status as coterminous, to wit:
 
 
 
FROM
 
 
 
SG
 
 
 
TO
 
 
 
SG
 
 
 
 
 
PHILJA Attorney VI 
 
 
27 
 
 
PHILJA Head Executive Assistant 
 
 
27 
 
 
2.  the reversion of the status from permanent to coterminous, but only insofar as the following positions in the Office of the Chancellor are concerned:
SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer      SG 25
Judicial Staff Officer III              SG 18
Judicial Staff Assistant III         SG 10
3.  the retention of the status as permanent of the position of Records Officer II (SG 14) in the Office of the Chancellor for purposes of continuity of the smooth operations in the office should there be a change of new administration.
With due respect to Honorables Justo P. Torres and Marina L. Buzon, PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary, respectively, we likewise respectfully recommend the following changes in their respective plantillas for purposes of maintaining the hierarchy of positions in the Executive Offices of the PHILJA:
1.  the conversion and/or reclassification of the following positions in the Offices of the Vice-Chancellor and of the Executive Secretary, and to retain their status as coterminous:
 
 
 
OFFICE
 
 
 
FROM
 
 
 
SG
 
 
 
TO
 
 
 
SG
 
 
 
 
 
Office of the
 
Vice-Chancellor
 
 
 PHILJA Attorney V 
 
 26 
 
 PHILJA Executive Assistant Supervisor 
 
 26 
 
 
 
 
Office of the
 
Executive Secretary
 
 
 PHILJA Attorney IV 
 
 25 
 
 PHILJA Executive Assistant VI 
 
 25 
 
 
2.  the reversion of the status of the permanent positions in the Offices of the PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary to coterminous, except for the position of Clerk III in each Office which we respectfully recommend to be retained both as permanent.
3.  the immediate filling up of the aforesaid three (3) converted/reclassified new coterminous positions, with the funds to be drawn from the savings of the Court, pending the release of the Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) by the DBM.
Should all these recommendations merit the approval of the Honorable Supreme Court, shown hereinbelow are the plantillas in the Executive Offices of the PHILJA showing the changes made therein, to wit:

On July 28, 2009, the Court directed the PHILJA to reply to the Memorandum dated July 22, 2009 of Atty. Candelaria, within ten (10) days from notice thereof.
In his letter dated August 12, 2009, addressed to the Chief Justice, Justice Azcuna stated that:
Anent the Resolution of the Honorable Supreme Court dated July 28, 2009, received by us on August 6, 2009, A.M. No. 01-1-04-PHILJA (Re:  Further Clarifying and Strengthening the Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-up of the Philippine Judicial Academy), the undersigned has no objection to the Memorandum date July 22, 2009 of Atty. Eden T. Candelaria, Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer, insofar as the Office of the Chancellor is concerned, but respectfully prays that the proposed changes in the Offices of the Vice-Chancellor and the Executive Secretary be deferred until after the end of the terms of the present Vice-Chancellor and Executive Secretary, unless said officials agree to have the same effective during their terms.
Respectfully submitted.
In the Resolution dated August 18, 2009, the Court required the Offices of the PHILJA, namely, Office of the Vice-Chancellor, Office of the Executive Secretary, and Administrative Division to comment on the letter dated June 17, 2009 and Letter-Compliance dated August 12, 2009 of PHILJA Chancellor, Justice Azcuna, as well as on the Memorandum dated July 22, 2009 of Atty. Candelaria, within ten (10) days from notice thereof, as these are the offices that will be affected by the proposed conversion and reclassification of the subject positions.
In their joint letter dated August 27, 2009, addressed to the Chief Justice, PHILJA Vice-Chancellor, Justice Justo P. Torres, PHILJA Executive Secretary, Justice Marina L. Buzon, and PHILJA Administrative Chief, Judge Thelma A. Ponferrada, with the conforme of PHILJA Chancellor, Justice Adolfo S. Azcuna, stated that:
Anent A.M. No. 01-1-04-PHILJA (Re:  Further Clarifying and Strenthening the Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-up of the Philippine Judicial Academy) and the Resolution of the Honorable Supreme Court therein dated August 18, 2009 and received by our office on August 26, 2009, the undersigned respectfully submit this Comment in compliance with the Resolution. Thus:
1. We respectfully agree with the Comment and Manifestation of Chancellor Adolfo S. Azcuna earlier filed on this matter dated August 12, 2009, copy of which is hereto attached as Annex "A," and adopts the same;
2. We join his urgent request that he be provided the staff he requested as recommended by Atty. Eden T. Candelaria, Chief, Office of Administrative Services of this Court, in her Memorandum dated July 22, 2009.
Respectfully submitted.
The recommendation of Atty. Candelaria is well-taken.  The Court grants the request of Justice Azcuna for the conversion of a position title and the reversion from permanent to coterminous status of certain positions, except the position of Records Officer III (SG 14), in the Office of the Chancellor, and approves and adopts the recommendation of Atty. Candelaria as to the change in the position titles of the heads of each of the Offices of the Vice-Chancellor and Executive Secretary and, likewise, the reversion from permanent to coterminous status,  except  the position of  Clerk III  (SG 6) in each office, in the staffing pattern of the two offices.
Section 11 of Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA, effective September 23, 2008, provides that:
Section 11. Staffing Pattern
In order to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, the staffing pattern of the Philippine Judicial Academy is hereby further strengthened to include sixty-nine (69) new positions to perform the functions of the new offices and divisions; reclassify four (4) existing positions; convert twenty (20) existing positions; change the status of eleven (11) co-terminous positions to permanent status and to realign some existing positions.

Due to the increase in the programs and commitments of the PHILJA, the Court 
en banc
[3]
 
issued Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA for the purpose of clarifying and strengthening the organizational structure and administrative set-up of the PHILJA, including the key operating systems, staffing pattern, and the need to make it more appropriate to an academic institution.  The Court amended the staffing pattern of the following offices of the PHILJA:
A.  Office of the Chancellor:
1.  PHILJA Attorney VI (SG 27) - newly created item; coterminous
2. SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer (SG 25) - from coterminous to permanent
3. Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) - from coterminous to permanent
4. Records Officer II [
formerly Stenographic Reporter IV (SG 13)
] (SG 14) - from coterminous to permanent
5. Judicial Staff Assistant III (SG 10) - from coterminous to permanent
B.  Office of the Vice-Chancellor:
1.  PHILJA Attorney V (SG 26) - newly created item; coterminous
2. SC Supervising Judicial Staff Officer (SG 23) - from coterminous to permanent
3. Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) - from coterminous to permanent
4. Clerk III (SG 6) - from coterminous to permanent
C.  Office of the Executive Secretary:
1.  PHILJA Attorney IV (SG 25) - newly created item; coterminous
2. Judicial Staff Officer VI (SG 23) - from coterminous to permanent
3. Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) - from coterminous to permanent
4. Clerk III (SG 6) - from coterminous to permanent
In 
Re: Clarifying and Strengthening the
 
Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-Up of the Philippine Judicial Academy
,
[4]
 
 the Court saw the necessity of retaining the originally proposed titles and salary grades of the positions of SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer (SG 25) and Supervising Judicial Staff Officer (SG 23) in the PHILJA as part of further enhancing its organizational structure and administrative set-up.
Corollarily, while the Court grants the request of Justice Azcuna that the PHILJA Attorney VI (SG 27), a newly created item, be changed to a non-lawyer designation, the appropriate position title should be PHILJA Head Executive Assistant with same Salary Grade 27, instead of Judicial Staff Head, which has an assigned Salary Grade 28, per Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades issued by the DBM.  The change in the position title to PHILJA Head Executive Assistant will afford him the discretion to hire an individual, including a non-lawyer, who possesses the qualifications required for the highly sensitive and confidential position.  The position of Judicial Staff Head is peculiar to the Offices of the Associate Justices performing functions pertaining to the adjudication of cases and administrative supervision and other confidential matters.  Additionally, as PHILJA Chancellor, Justice Azcuna should be given a free hand to select his office staff based on his trust and confidence and, hence, the need to have some position status changed from permanent to coterminous.  The position of Records Officer II should remain to be permanent as there is a need to ensure the continuity of workflow and preserve the records management.
Similarly, the changes in the nomenclature for the positions of PHILJA Attorney V to PHILJA Executive Assistant Supervisor (with same SG 26) for the Office of the Vice-Chancellor, and PHILJA Attorney IV to PHILJA Executive Assistant VI (with same SG 25) of the Office of the Executive Secretary, both being newly created and with position status of coterminous, are justified as the Vice-Chancellor and the Executive Secretary have the prerogative to hire heads of their office staff upon whom they can repose their trust and confidence.  The heads of the three offices who occupy Private Secretary positions perform functions which are primarily confidential in nature and, thus, coterminous with the official they
serve.

 In like manner, the hiring of key positions which are categorized as
confidential should be reverted from permanent to coterminous, except the position of Clerk III (SG 6) in each office which should remain to be permanent as there is a need to ensure the continuity of workflow and preserve the records management.
Thus, the following will be the amended staffing pattern of the respective offices of the PHILJA:
A.  Office of the Chancellor:
PHILJA Head Executive Assistant (SG 27) -
newly-created item; coterminous
SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer (SG 25) -
from permanent to coterminous
Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) -
from permanent to coterminous
Judicial Staff Assistant III (SG 10) -
from permanent to coterminous
B.  Office of the Vice-Chancellor:
PHILJA Executive Assistant Supervisor (SG 26) - newly-created item; coterminous
SC Supervising Judicial Staff Officer (SG 23) -
from permanent to coterminous
Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) -
from permanent to coterminous
C.  Office of the Executive Secretary:
PHILJA Executive Assistant VI (SG 25) -
newly-created item; coterminous
Judicial Staff Officer VI (SG 22) -
from permanent to coterminous
Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) -
from permanent to coterminous
