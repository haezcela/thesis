In a 
Resolution
[4]
 dated 9 December 2008, this Court required the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for respondent Civil Service Commission (CSC), to comment on the aforequoted Compromise Agreement.
By way of compliance, the OSG filed on 1 April 2009 the required 
Comment
[5]
 on the Compromise Agreement. In its 
Comment
, the OSG stated that the provisions of said agreement warranted clarification as to (1) whether or not the subject Compromise Agreement had been approved by the 
Sangguniang
 
Panlalawigan
 of the Province of Misamis Oriental; (2) whether or not the 
Sangguniang
 
Panlalawigan
 of the Province of Misamis Oriental had already approved and appropriated the necessary public funds for the payment of the backwages and other benefits of private respondent Anayron; and (3) the actual date of reinstatement of the latter.
On 4 June 2009, the Province of Misamis Oriental, through its incumbent Governor, Oscar S. Moreno (Gov. Moreno), filed a 
Manifestation

ANAYRON, AGRICULTURIST II OF THE PROVINCIAL AGRICULTURE OFFICE TO BE TAKEN FROM RESERVE FOR PERSONNEL BENEFITS." - This issuance by the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan 
of Misamis Oriental approved and appropriated the amount of P1,100,000.00 for the payment of private respondent Anayron's backwages and other benefits per the Compromise Agreement signed by the latter and Gov. Moreno, for and in behalf of the Province of Misamis Oriental.

 dated 6 May 2009, issued by the Office of the Provincial Accountant, to the effect that the payment for private respondent Anayron's back salaries and other benefits commenced from 13 July 1999 up to 16 April 2006 only.  From 17 April 2006, when private respondent Anayron was officially reinstated to her old position, until 31 December 2006, she was paid her salaries and other benefits based on actual services rendered.
The OSG filed on 11 August 2009 a 
Comment
[10]
 on Gov. Moreno's 
Manifestation
.  On the basis of the certified true copies of the documents attached to the said Manifestation, the OSG submitted that it no longer had any reservation to the approval of the subject Compromise Agreement.
A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or put an end to one already commenced.
[11]
  It contemplates mutual concessions and mutual gains to avoid the expenses of litigation; or when litigation has already begun, to end it because of the uncertainty of the result.
The validity of a compromise agreement is dependent upon its fulfillment of the requisites and principles of contracts dictated by law; and its terms and conditions must not be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy and public order.
[12]
After a review of the terms of the Compromise Agreement between the parties herein, we find that it has been validly executed in accordance with the foregoing requirements.
WHEREFORE
, it appearing that the Compromise Agreement in this case is not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public morals and public policy, the same is hereby 
approved 
and 
adopted 
as the decision of this Court.
The parties are hereby ordered to faithfully comply with the terms and conditions of said agreement.
This case is considered 
closed
 and 
terminated
.  No costs.
