SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 185261, October 02, 2009 ]


WALLEM MARITIME SERVICES, INC. AND SCANDIC SHIPMANAGEMENT LIMITED, PETITIONER, VS. ERIBERTO S. BULTRON, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. and Scandic Shipmanagement, Ltd. (petitioners) hired Eriberto S. Bultron (respondent) on February 3, 1999 as crane operator in their vessel 
MV EASTERN FALCON
 for a period of twelve (12) months.
In the course of his employment, respondent developed "chronic coughs," hence, petitioners referred him to their company physician in Langkawi, Malaysia who issued a medical report dated April 6, 2000 stating, 
 inter alia
, that "by the nature of [respondent's] work as a seaman, he has been exposed to cement dust as his cargo ship carries cement;" and that his "Chest X-ray shows bilateral apical infiltrations of the lungs, minimal pleural effusion of the left lung and heart configuration is enlarged."  Dr. Haroun thus advised petitioners to take care of him "for further management . . ."
[1] 
Petitioners allowed respondent to continue with his job until he was repatriated to Manila on April 29, 2000 at the expiration of his contract.
[2]
 As respondent constantly complained of "on and off cough[ing]," petitioners referred him to the Metropolitan Hospital.
After a series of medical tests, Dr. Robert D. Lim (Dr. Lim), petitioners' medical coordinator at the Metropolitan Hospital, issued a medical report 
on July 28, 2000
 stating that, 
inter alia
, respondent "is now fit to work."
[3]
Respondent refused, however, to sign the certificate of fitness for work as he felt he was still ill and suffering from disabilities.
[4]
Petitioners having discontinued providing medical services and treatment, respondent consulted, at his own expense, a private physician, Dr. Juan Alejandro Legaspi (Dr. Legaspi), who diagnosed him on August 10, 2000 to be suffering from "spinal stenosis, L4-L5, L5-S1," and thus advised him to "avoid exertional activities and prolonged sitting" and to have `bed rest.'
[5]
Claiming, 
inter alia
, that his illness has "persisted" and has "totally disabled [him] from pursuing his work as a seaman" due to petitioners' failure to provide safety measures and protective gears during his work to shield him from contracting illnesses, respondent filed a 
Complaint
[6]
 for disability benefits and damages against petitioners before the NLRC-NCR Arbitration Branch, Quezon City.
Petitioners resisted respondent's 
Complaint
, contending that under the POEA Standard Employment Contract, he may only recover such benefits when his repatriation is due to medical reasons, not when it is due to completion of contract as in his case.
By Decision dated October 8, 2003, Labor Arbiter Felipe P. Pati found for respondent, disposing as follows:
WHEREFORE, premises all considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents [now petitioners] jointly and severally liable to:
pay complainant [now respondent] his proportionate disability benefits in the amount of US$60,000.00 or its peso equivalent at the time of payment; and
pay complainant attorney's fees at 10% of the total monetary award to be recovered.
All other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
[7]
After petitioners received a copy of the Labor Arbiter's Decision on November 4, 2003, they filed a 
Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum
 via registered mail on the 
last day
 of the 10-day reglementary period of appeal or on November 14, 2003, a Friday, 
without the requisite 
appeal bond
.  It was only on the next business day, 
November 17, 2003
, that 
they filed the 
appeal bond
, together with another copy of petitioners' 
Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum
.
Respondent thus filed a 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal
[8]
 
 
on the ground that petitioners' appeal was filed out of time.
Explaining their failure to file their 
appeal bond
 on November 14, 2003, petitioners, through counsel, stated that the appeal bond "
was not processed on time by the bonding company
" and "was issued only on 14 November 2003 at around 4:05 PM in the office of Pioneer Insurance Corporation at Paseo de Roxas, Makati City;" and that "undersigned counsel then carried the 
appeal bond
, drove his car from Makati to Manila area," but "due to extreme traffic condition, he called-up thru his mobile phone his legal assistant to file the appeal via registered mail."
[9]
Petitioners thus concluded that "
there is actually no delay
 inasmuch as the appeal was 
initiated
 within the ten-day reglementary period via registered mail."
[10] 
The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), by Decision
[11] 
 of March 8, 2006, 
denied 
respondent's motion to dismiss petitioners' appeal which it considered to have been effected on November 14, 2003.  On the merits, it 
reversed
 the Labor Arbiter's decision and accordingly dismissed respondent's complaint, as well as petitioners' permissive counter-claims.
Respondent's 
Motion for Reconsideration
[12]
 having been denied, he filed a petition for 
Certiorari
 before the Court of Appeals.
By Decision
[13]
 of February 20, 2008, the appellate court annulled the NLRC Decision and Resolution, and 
reinstated
 the Labor Arbiter's Decision, it ruling that the NLRC "never acquired jurisdiction" over the appeal of petitioners as they "failed to perfect their appeal "within the ten calendar-day period" and thus render the Labor Arbiter's Decision final and executory.
[14]
Petitioners' 
Motion for Reconsideration
 having been denied by Resolution of October 22, 2008,
[15]
 they filed the present Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
.
The petition fails.
The decisions, awards or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the NLRC by any parties 
within ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof,
 with proof of payment of the required appeal fee accompanied by a memorandum of appeal.  And where, as here, the 
judgment involves monetary award
, an appeal therefrom by the 
employer
 may be "
perfected only
 upon the 
posting of a cash or surety bond
." 
[16]
 A mere notice of appeal without complying with the other requisites mentioned does not stop the running of the period for perfecting an appeal
[17]
 as in fact  no motion for extension of said period is allowed.
[18]
The perfection of appeals in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory but 
jurisdictional
 and must, therefore, be strictly observed.
Petitioners' re-filing on the next working day, November 17, 2003, of the 
Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum
, which was accompanied, this time, by the 
appeal bond
, did not cure the fatal defect of their appeal since said bond
 
was filed 
after
 the ten-day reglementary period had expired - at which time the Labor Arbiter's judgment had already become final and executory and, therefore, immutable. 
[19]
Respecting petitioners' argument that their appeal was "initiated" within the ten-day reglementary period," 
[20]
 suffice it to state that 
all 
the 
essential 
 requirements
 for the perfection of the appeal 
must be
 
filed
 
within
 the reglementary period.
Petitioners' bare invocation of "the interest of substantial justice" does not lie."
[21]
 Only under exceptionally meritorious cases may a relaxation from an otherwise stringent rule be allowed "to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed"
 [22]
 - the existence of which petitioners failed to demonstrate.
WHEREFORE
, the present Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 is 
DENIED
.  Costs against petitioners.
SO ORDERED
