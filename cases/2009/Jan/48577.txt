PROTACIO VICENTE AND DOMINGA VICENTE, REPRESENTED BY RONDOLF VICENTE, PETITIONERS, VS. DELIA SOLEDAD AVERA AND RONBERTO VALINO, SHERIFF IV, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 70, PASIG CITY,  RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




PUNO, C.J.:


This Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 seeks to set aside the Decision
[1]
 and Resolution
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA), dated June 16, 2005 and October 4, 2005 respectively, in CA-G.R. CV No. 79327, which reversed the Decision
[3]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 208, Mandaluyong City, dated March 30, 2003.
Jovencio Rebuquiao was the registered owner of the property in dispute, then covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 34351.
[4]
 On October 1, 1987, Rebuquiao executed a Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of petitioners, spouses Protacio Vicente and Dominga Vicente, over the property in dispute.
[5]
 Respondent Delia Soledad Avera alleges that on October 9, 1987, Jose Rebuquiao, pursuant to a Special Power of Attorney granted to him by Jovencio Rebuquiao, executed a Deed of Absolute Sale with Assumption of Mortgage in favor of Roberto Domingo, Avera's spouse at the time, and herself.
[6]
On May 29, 1991, Avera filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage before the RTC, Branch 70, Pasig City, entitled "Delia Soledad Domingo, etc. v. Roberto Domingo" and docketed as JDRC Case No. 1989-J (JDRC case).
[7]
 In this case, Avera asserted exclusive ownership over the property in dispute.
[8]
 On January 23, 1992, a notice of 
lis pendens 
was inscribed on TCT No. 34351, pertaining to the JDRC case pending at the time.
[9]
Since 1997, petitioners possessed the property in dispute.
[10]
 On July 22, 1998, TCT No. 34351 was cancelled, and in lieu thereof, the Registry of Deeds issued petitioners TCT No. 14216 for the property in dispute, on the basis of the deed of sale executed on October 1, 1987.
[11]
 The notice of 
lis pendens
 was carried over to TCT No. 14216.
[12]
On November 28, 1994, the RTC, Branch 70, Pasig City, rendered a Decision in the JDRC case, declaring the marriage of Avera and Domingo void and ordering the property acquired during their cohabitation to be put in the custody of Avera, including the property in dispute.
[13]
 After the decision in the JDRC case became final and executory, the RTC, Branch 70, Pasig City, issued a Writ of Execution.
[14]
 On June 13, 2001, the same trial court issued an Alias Writ of Execution, which reads:
Movant declared in her motion that the said property is now registered in the name of another person, namely, Protacio Vicente, under TCT No. 14216 of the Register of Deeds of Mandaluyong City. It appearing, however, that the transfer was made notwithstanding the annotation thereon of the notice of lis pendens that the same property is the subject of the instant case, it can still be the subject of a writ of execution to satisfy the judgment in favor of herein petitioner.
WHEREFORE, let an alias writ of execution be issued over Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34351, now covered by TCT No. 14216 of the Register of Deeds of Mandaluyong City.
SO ORDERED.
[15]
Pursuant to the Alias Writ of Execution, respondent Ronberto Valino, in his capacity as Sheriff IV of the RTC, Branch 70, Pasig City, served a Notice to Vacate dated August 15, 2001, on petitioners.
[16]
 On August 17, 2001, petitioners filed an Affidavit of Third Party Claim before the RTC, Branch 70, Pasig City.
[17]
On August 22, 2001, petitioners filed a Complaint for Injunction with Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) before the RTC, Branch 208, Mandaluyong City, to enjoin Sheriff Valino from implementing the alias writ of execution.
[18]
 On September 4, 2001, the trial court issued a TRO
[19]
 and, on May 29, 2002, a Writ of Preliminary Injunction, enjoining respondents from enforcing the notice to vacate.
[20]
 On March 30, 2003, it rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered making the writ of preliminary injunction PERMANENT.
Defendants' counterclaims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
[21]
It held that petitioners were entitled to permanent injunction considering the following: (1) it is undisputed that petitioners are the registered owners of the subject property, which certificate of title confers upon them conclusive ownership of the property; and (2) the writ of execution issued in the JDRC case could only be issued against a party to the action, and thus not to the petitioners.
[22]
On appeal, the CA reversed and set aside the decision of the RTC, Branch 208, Mandaluyong City.
[23]
 The CA held that petitioners are bound by the outcome of the JDRC case, because the annotation of the notice of 
lis pendens
 (January 23, 1992) was ahead of petitioners' registration of the deed of sale executed on October 1, 1987 (July 22, 1998).
[24]
 Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the CA denied.
[25]
Petitioners raise the following issues before this Court:
I
The CA erred in ordering the dismissal of the complaint for injunction despite the fact that the Petitioners are the registered owners of the property and as such cannot be evicted out therefrom unless:
A. the sale from which they based their acquisition is declared void.
B. the title issued in their names based on the Deed of Sale is likewise declared void.
II
The CA erred in dismissing the complaint because in so doing, it made an implied recognition that a real property titled under the torrens system may be attacked collaterally in contravention of law and established jurisprudence[.]
III
The CA erred in concluding that the Petitioners are bound by the lis pendens it being clear that the property was acquired long before the lis pendens was annotated. Petitioners' (sic) became owners of the property on October 1, 1987 and not on July 20, 1998 when their ownership was merely confirmed by the title issued by the Office of the Register of Deeds.
Petitioners maintain that as the registered owners and actual possessors of the property in dispute, they are entitled to a writ of injunction that will prevent the implementation of the writ of execution corresponding to the JDRC case.
Respondents assert that petitioners are not entitled to the writ of injunction, because the petitioners are subject to the outcome of the JDRC case and thus the implementation of the writ of execution due to the notice of 
lis pendens
 annotated on their TCT. They further allege: (1) that there was no sale by Rebuquiao in favor of petitioners on October 1, 1987; and (2) if there was a sale, the same happened in 1997, the year petitioners registered the deed of sale executed in their favor.
[26]
The core issue in the case at bar is whether injunction lies in favor of the petitioners to prevent the respondents from interfering in the exercise of their rights over the property in dispute.
We find merit in the petition.
Injunction, as a preservative remedy, aims to protect substantive rights and interests.
[27]
 To be entitled to a writ of injunction, the complainant must establish the following requisites: (1) there must be a right in 
esse
 or the existence of a right to be protected; and (2) the act against which injunction is to be directed is a violation of such right.
[28]
 The grant of the writ is conditioned on the existence of the complainant's clear legal right, which means one clearly founded in or granted by law or is "enforceable as a matter of law."
[29]
As the registered owners and actual possessors of the property in question, petitioners have a clear legal right to the property in dispute. Section 51 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529 provides that registration is the operative act that conveys or affects registered land as against third persons.
[30]
 Thus, a TCT is the best proof of ownership of land.
[31]
 In the case at bar, it is undisputed that petitioners are the registered owners and actual possessors of the subject property. Moreover, as the registered owners, petitioners have the right to the possession of the property, which is one of the attributes of ownership.
[32]
It was erroneous for respondents to assail the deed of sale executed on October 1, 1987 in favor of petitioners, because this constitutes a collateral attack on petitioners' TCT.  Section 48 of P.D. No. 1529 prohibits a collateral attack on a Torrens title.
[33]
 This Court has held that a petition which, in effect, questioned the validity of a deed of sale for registered land constitutes a collateral attack on a certificate of title.
[34]
 In the case at bar, respondents' allegation, that the deed of sale executed on October 1, 1987 in favor of petitioners does not exist, clearly constitutes a collateral attack on a certificate of title. The allegation of the inexistence of the deed of sale in effect attacks the validity of the TCT issued in the petitioners' names.
Petitioners' title to the property in dispute is not subject to the outcome of the litigation covered by the notice of 
lis pendens
 annotated on January 23, 1992. Section 24, Rule 14 of the 1964 Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a purchaser of the property affected by the notice of 
lis pendens
 is deemed to have constructive notice of the pendency of the action only from the time of filing such notice.
[35]
 Section 14, Rule 13 of the 1997 
 Rules of Civil Procedure reiterates this rule.
[36]
 Thus, a notice of 
lis pendens
 affects a transferee 
pendente lite
, who by virtue of the notice, is bound by any judgment, which may be rendered for or against the transferor, and his title is subject to the results of the pending litigation.
[37]
A notice of 
lis pendens
 neither affects the merits of a case nor creates a right or a lien.
[38]
 It serves to protect the real rights of the registrant while the case involving such rights is pending resolution.
[39]
 While the notice of 
lis pendens
 remains on a certificate of title, the registrant could rest secure that he would not lose the property or any part of it during the litigation.
[40]
 Once a notice of 
lis pendens
 has been duly registered, any subsequent transaction affecting the land involved would have to be subject to the outcome of the litigation. For this reason, the Court has pronounced that a "purchaser who buys registered land with full notice of the fact that it is in litigation between the vendor and a third party stands in the shoes of his vendor and his title is subject to the incidents and result of the pending litigation."
[41]
In the case at bar, the notice of 
lis pendens
 does not affect petitioners' title to the property in dispute. A notice of 
lis pendens
 concerns litigation between a transferor and a third party, where the transferee who acquires land with a notice of 
lis pendens
 annotated on the corresponding certificate of title stands in the shoes of his predecessor and in which case the transferee's title is subject to the results of the pending litigation. The notice of 
lis pendens
 does not concern litigation involving Rebuquiao, who transferred his title to the property in dispute to petitioners, and his title. The notice of 
lis pendens
 pertains to the JDRC case, an action for nullity of the marriage between Avera and Domingo. Since Rebuquiao's title to the property in dispute is not subject to the results of the JDRC case, petitioners' title to the same property is also not subject to the results of the JDRC case.
To determine whether the second requisite for granting a writ of injunction exists, that the act against which injunction is to be directed is a violation of the complainant's right, we must examine the implications regarding the implementation of the writ of execution over TCT No. 14216. Pursuant to this writ of execution, Sheriff Valino served petitioners with a notice to vacate.
If allowed to be carried out, the act against which the injunction is directed, the implementation of the writ of execution, would violate petitioners' rights as the registered owners and actual possessors of the property in dispute. The registered owner has the right to possess and enjoy his property, without any limitations other than those imposed by law.
[42]
 The implementation of the writ of execution would unduly deprive petitioners, as the registered owners, of their right to possess the subject property, which is one of the attributes of ownership.
[43]
We must stress that until petitioners' title is annulled in a proper proceeding, Avera has no enforceable right over the property in dispute. At this point, petitioners' possession of the subject property must be respected. Since Avera failed to prove her indubitable right over the subject property, we rule that petitioners possess a clear and unmistakable right over the property in dispute that requires the issuance of a writ of injunction to prevent any damage to their interests as registered owners.
IN VIEW WHEREOF
, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 79327, dated June 16, 2005 and October 4, 2005 respectively, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
