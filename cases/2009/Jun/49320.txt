[ G.R. No. 178461, June 22, 2009 ]


CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE CITY OF LAS PIÃAS AND THE HON. RIZAL Y. DEL ROSARIO, CITY TREASURER, RESPONDENTS.
RESOLUTION




NACHURA, J.:


For our consideration and approval is a Joint Petition
[1]
 [Motion] to Withdraw Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 dated February 5, 2008.
Earlier, or on June 21, 2007, petitioner filed a Petition
[2]
 for Review on 
Certiorari
 questioning the assessments issued by the City of Las PiÃ±as through the City Treasurer for local and real property taxes in the amount of P73,043,634.47.
After filing of the required Comment
[3]
 and Reply
[4]
, we gave due course to the Petition and directed both parties to submit their respective memoranda
[5]
.
During the pendency of this case, petitioner offered to compromise the case by paying fifty percent (50%) of the amount assessed.  Since petitioner's factory in Las PiÃ±as had already ceased operations and in order to facilitate the issuance of the clearance for the cessation of its business, the decision to enter into a compromise was adopted by the respondents.
Through City Resolution No. 2385-08
[6]
, the City Council of Las PiÃ±as approved the compromise offer.  The City Resolution readsâ
Republic of the Philippines
City of Las PiÃ±as

 City Mayor
Petitioner has already settled and paid the amount of P36,522,817.24
[7]
 in accordance with the compromised 50% of the assessed amount.
Article 1306 of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides that contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms, and conditions, as they may deem convenient, provided that they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.  A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions, avoid litigation, or put an end to one already commenced.
[8]
  It is an accepted, even desirable and encouraged, practice in courts of law and administrative tribunals.
[9]
A compromise agreement intended to resolve a matter already under litigation is a judicial compromise.  Having judicial mandate and entered as its determination of the controversy, it has the force and effect of a judgment.  It transcends its identity as a mere contract between the parties as it becomes a judgment that is subject to execution in accordance with the Rules of Court. Thus, a compromise agreement that has been made and duly approved by the court attains the effect and authority of 
res judicata
, although no execution may be issued unless the agreement receives the approval of the court where the litigation is pending and compliance with the terms of the agreement is decreed.
[10]
Finding City Resolution No. 2385-08, Series of 2008 of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Las PiÃ±as to be validly executed and not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy, we therefore, accept and approve the same.
WHEREFORE
, the Joint Petition [Motion] to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari dated February 5, 2008 is 
GRANTED
.  Judgment is hereby rendered in accordance with City Resolution No. 2385-08, Series of 2008 of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Las PiÃ±as.  The instant case is 
DISMISSED
.  No pronouncement as to costs.
SO ORDERED
