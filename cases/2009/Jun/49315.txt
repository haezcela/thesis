WITNESSETH THAT:
WHEREAS, Sps. Eduardo Tankiang and Mayda Tankiang (hereinafter "Sps.

Tankiang, as borrower/mortgagor and Metrobank, as creditor/mortgagee.
WHEREAS, the Sps. Tankiang hereby acknowledge the existence of its loan, which was granted by the original creditor bank, Metrobank.  Moreover, Sps. Tankiang also acknowledge the sale, transfer and conveyance of its loan account and the securities/collaterals they executed pursuant to such loan from Metrobank, subsequently to Asia Recovery Corporation and then finally to LNC.
WHEREAS, to buy peace and avoid further litigation, the Parties have agreed to settle their differences subject of the Civil Cases.
NOW, THEREFORE
, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, and subject to the mutual covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, in the spirit of goodwill and understanding, and to avoid the uncertainties and additional costs of litigation, the Parties have agreed to amicably settle their misunderstandings, including the Civil Cases, and all other and future claims between the Parties arising out of the facts and circumstances alleged in the Civil Cases, and hereby agree as follows:
I. 
Terms of Settlement:
A. Manner
In view of the mutual desire of the parties to liquidate the properties which are currently in the possession of Sps. Tankiang and Metrobank, the Parties expressly agree that the Sps. Tankiang shall:
Buy back the residential property at 1146 Tamarind Road, DasmariÃ±as Village, Makati City covered by T[ransfer] Certificate of Title No. 219538 and commercial lots at Roxas Boulevard (Service Road) Brgy. San Rafael, Pasay City, covered by Tranfer Certificate of Title Nos. 145175 and 145176.
It is understood by the Parties that all taxes, fees and expenses relative to the transfer and consolidation of the properties referred herein to Sps. Tankiang shall be borne exclusively by the latter including but not limited to the consolidation of the titles from Metrobank and any and all succeeding transfer of title as deemed necessary in their favor.
Have a right to match any offer to sell the following properties:
(i)   residential property at 39 Banaba St., Forbes Park (South), Makati City; and
(ii)  residential property at 214 Recoletos St., Urdaneta Village, Makati City;
Sps. Tankiang shall have the right to match an offer for the purchase of the properties in item (b) above by other party on the same terms and conditions as may be set forth in any bona fide offer received by LNC from a third party, in writing.  LNC, upon receipt of such offer to purchase, shall promptly transmit the offer to Sps. Tankiang who shall have a period of thirty (30) days to match the offer and all of its terms, covenants and conditions (the "Acceptance Period").  Sps. Tankiang shall send to LNC a written notice of acceptance of the offer within the Acceptance Period.  The failure to accept the offer within the Acceptance Period containing the same terms and conditions as set forth in the offer shall be deemed a waiver of Sps. Tankiang's right to match and LNC may therefore sell the property upon all of the terms set forth in the offer.  The right to match shall be for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of signing of this settlement agreement and conditioned on the faithful compliance by Sps. Tankiang of all the terms and conditions stipulated therein.  After the lapse of such period, LNC may offer for sale the property to any third party.
The Parties hereby agree that Sps. Tankiang shall inform the tenants of all subject properties, if any, as to the terms and conditions of this Compromise Agreement within thirty (30) days from the date of signing of this Agreement.
However, Metrobank and LNC shall be rendered free and harmless of all and any liability arising out of the sale and liquidation of the properties, provided that Metrobank and LNC comply in good faith with the manner of sale, as stated in this Agreement.
For and in consideration of this opportunity to match any offer to purchase the above-described properties, the Sps. Tankiang hereby unconditionally agree to surrender, within five (5) days from the signing of this Agreement, to LNC or its authorized agents or representatives the possession of the commercial vacant lots at National Hi-way corner Barrio San Isidro, Cabuyao, Laguna.  Sps. Tankiang further confirm LNC's (or Metrobank) right of possession over residential property at 39 Banaba St., Forbes Park (South), Makati City; and residential property at 214 Recoletos St., Urdaneta Village, Makati City.
For the properties subject of buyback, particularly the DasmariÃ±as property, the real property taxes shall continuously be paid by the Sps. Tankiang.  For the Roxas Boulevard property, Sps. Tankiang shall reimburse any taxes paid in advance by LNC3. For clarity, cut off date for the computation of the pro-rata reimbursement shall commence from the execution of this agreement.
The Parties hereby agree that the rights granted to Sps. Tankiang in relation to the right to match any offer to sell the subject properties are exclusive and shall not be assigned to any third party.

In compliance with the directive of this Court, Metrobank filed its Comment
[7]
 on the Manifestation and/or Motion for Judgment, confirming the fact that the parties had indeed settled their differences subject of the Petition.
Under Article 1306 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms, and conditions, as they may deem convenient, provided that these are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.  A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions in order to resolve their differences, thereby putting an end to litigation.
[8]
  Such means of dispute settlement is an accepted, even desirable and encouraged, practice in courts of law and administrative tribunals.
[9]
Finding the above Compromise Agreement to have been validly executed and not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy, we, therefore, approve the same.
WHEREFORE
, in light of the foregoing, the Compromise Agreement dated January 8, 2009 is 
APPROVED,
 and judgment is hereby rendered in accordance therewith.  The instant case is 
DISMISSED
.  No pronouncement as to costs.
