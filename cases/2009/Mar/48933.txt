ALDO B. CORDIA, PETITIONER, VS. JOEL G. MONFORTE AND COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Aldo B. Cordia (petitioner) and Joel G. Monforte (respondent) were official candidates for the position of 
Punong Barangay 
of Barangay 16 (East Washington) in Legazpi City, Albay during the July 15, 2002 synchronized 
Barangay 
and 
Sangguniang Kabataan 
elections.
After the canvassing of votes, the 
Barangay 
Board of Canvassers proclaimed petitioner as the winning candidate, having obtained 614 votes against the 609 votes obtained by respondent.
On July 18, 2002, respondent filed an Election Protest before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Legazpi City, alleging that "(f)or lack of familiarity with the Rules on Appreciation of ballot[s] under Sec. 49 of COMELEC Resolution No. 4846 dated June 13, 2002, the Board of Election Teller failed to credit [him]with as many as ten (10) votes."
[1]
The MTCC ordered a recount of the votes which yielded the following results:
[2]
 
 
 
 
JOEL MONFORTE
  [respondent]
 
ALDO CORDIA 
 [petitioner]
 
 
 
UNCONTESTED VOTES
 
591
 
440
 
 
 
ADD: CONTESTED/OBJECTED But Credited Votes
 
 18
 
174
 
 
 
ADD: CLAIMED and ADMITTED VOTES
 
   7
 
   0
 
 
 
TOTAL:
 
616
 
614
 
 
The MTCC thereupon rendered judgment in favor of respondent, accordingly annulling and setting aside the proclamation of petitioner, declaring respondent as the lawful and duly elected 
Punong Barangay
, 
 
directing petitioner to vacate the Office of the 
Punong Barangay 
and to relinquish said position to respondent, and ordering petitioner to pay the total amount of P6,350.00 representing the honoraria of the members of the Revision Committee and its support staff and other miscellaneous expenses.
[3]
On appeal, the Second Division of the COMELEC affirmed the MTCC Decision by Resolution
[4]
 of August 14, 2003.
On Motion for Reconsideration, the COMELEC En Banc affirmed
[5]
 the decision of the Second Division by a 5-1 vote with Commissioner Rene V. Sarmiento dissenting.
[6]
Hence, petitioner's present Petition for Certiorari (With Urgent Application for Temporary Restraining Order),
[7]
 alleging that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion
(I)
x x x in applying the neighborhood rule when it disregarded judicial precedents and credited as votes in favor of respondent, a candidate for 
punong barangay
, the questioned ballots marked as Exhibits A, D, E, F, H, and K on the mere basis that his name was written on the first space or line intended for the position of kagawad
(II)
x x x in applying the principle of 
idem sonans 
when it counted in favor of private respondent the vote "Mantete" appearing in the questioned ballot marked as Exhibit "A" and worse, written not on the line or space for 
punong barangay 
but 
kagawad
.
(III)
x x x when it ruled that the circle mark on the ballot marked as Exhibit C-17 xxx is but an ink smudge which is not a marking of the ballot.
[8]
  
(Emphasis supplied)
In the meantime, the MTCC issued on October 31, 2006 a writ of execution.
[9]
  In view of petitioner's filing before this Court of an Extremely Urgent Motion Reiterating the Application for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order,
[10]
 the MTCC recalled and set aside the Writ of Execution.
[11]
  And, on respondent's Motion for Execution of Judgment,
[12]
 the COMELEC declared its Resolution final and executory,
[13]
 and entered its judgment.
[14]
  On January 15, 2007, respondent took his oath of office.
[15]
The Court finds the petition bereft of merit.
The object of the appreciation of ballots is to ascertain and carry into effect the intention of the voter, if it can be determined with reasonable certainty.
[16]
  When placed in issue, the appreciation of contested ballots and election documents, which involves a question of fact, is best left to the determination of the COMELEC.
[17]
The COMELEC, in crediting to respondent the vote for "Mantete" in Exhibit "A," following the 
idem sonans 
rule, the Court finds no grave abuse discretion.
Petitioner posits that "Mantete" could refer to Pedro Andes, a candidate for 
kagawad 
who, according to him, was fondly called "Pete" or "Mang Pete" in the 
barangay
.
[18]
 As respondent counters, that there is no proof that "
Mang 
Pete
"
 is Andes' registered nickname.
[19]
  
Neither does the Court find grave abuse of discretion in the COMELEC's application to Exhibits "A," "D," "E," "F," "H," and "K"
[20]
 of the "neighborhood rule," which rule refers to:
As used by this Court, this nomenclature, loosely based on a rule of the same name devised by the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), 
refers to an exception to the rule on appreciation of misplaced votes
 under Section 211 (19) of 
Batas Pambansa Blg. 
881 (Omnibus Election Code)  which provides:
"
Any vote
 in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or 
in favor of a candidate for an office for which he did not present himself shall be considered as a stray vote
 but it shall not invalidate the whole ballot." (Emphasis supplied.)
Section 211 (19) is meant to avoid confusion in the minds of the election officials as to the candidates actually voted for and to stave off any scheming design to identify the vote of the elector, thus defeating the secrecy of the ballot which is a cardinal feature of our election laws.  Section 211 (19) also enforces Section 195 of the Omnibus Election Code which provides that in preparing the ballot, each voter must "fill his ballot by writing in the proper place for each office the name of the individual candidate for whom he desires to vote."
Excerpted from Section 211 (19) are ballots with (1) 
a general misplacement of an 
entire series
 of names intended to be voted for successive offices appearing in the ballot
, (2) a single or double misplacement of names where such names were preceded or followed by the title of the contested office or where the voter wrote after the candidate's name a directional symbol indicating the correct office for which the misplaced name was intended; and (3) a single misplacement of a name written (a) off-center from the designated space, (b) slightly underneath the line for the contested office, (c) immediately above the title for the contested office, or (d) in the space for an office immediately following that for which the candidate presented himself.  In these instances, the misplaced votes are nevertheless credited to the candidates for the office for which they presented themselves because the voters' intention to so vote is clear from the face of the ballots. This is in consonance with the settled doctrine that ballots should be appreciated with liberality to give effect to the voters' will.
[21]
 (Underscoring and italics supplied)
Nor does the Court find grave abuse of discretion in the COMELEC's not rejecting Exhibit "C-17"
[22]
 as a marked ballot, there being no indication that the blot therein was deliberately placed to identify the voter.  Thus, Section 211 (22) of the Omnibus Election Code states
Unless it should clearly appear that they have been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks
, commas, dots, lines, or hyphens between the first name and surname of a candidate, or in other parts of the ballot, traces of the letter "T", "J", and other similar ones, the first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not continue, the use of two or more kinds of writing and unintentional or accidental flourishes, strokes, or strains, 
shall not invalidate the ballot
.  (Underscoring supplied)
Petitioner argues, nevertheless, that the COMELEC did not examine the original ballot marked as Exhibit "C-17," for if it did, it could have seen that what appears thereon is not a mere ink smudge but a hole with "searing around it deliberately burned by a lighted cigarette."
[23]
  Both parties admitted the 
authenticity
 of the copies of the ballots examined in the case, however.
[24]
Even assuming that what appears to be an ink smudge on Exhibit "C-17" is actually a hole burned by a lighted cigarette, there is no proof that the burning was deliberately done to identify the voter.
