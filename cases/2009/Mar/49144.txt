DECISION




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


 This petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeks to annul and set aside the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 76755
[1]
 dated May 31, 2007
[2]
 which reversed the Order
[3]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Molave, Zamboanga Del Sur, Branch 23 in Civil Case No. 99-20-127 which denied respondents' motion for execution on the ground that petitioners' family home was still subsisting. Also assailed is the Resolution dated September 21, 2007 denying the motion for reconsideration.
The facts as summarized by the appellate court:
Deceased Felix Odong was the registered owner of Lot No. 7777, Ts- 222 located in Molave, Zamboanga del Sur. Said lot was covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 0-2,768 pursuant to Decree No. N-64 and issued on March 9, 1966.  However, Felix Odong and his heirs never occupied nor took possession of the lot.
On June 16, 1987, plaintiff-appellants bought said real property from the heirs of Felix Odong for P8,000.00.  Consequently, OCT No. 0-2,768 was cancelled and in its stead, Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-22,048 was issued on August 6, 1987 in the name of plaintiff-appellants.  The latter also did not occupy the said property.
Defendant-appellees, on the other hand, had been in continuous, open, peaceful and adverse possession of the same parcel of land since 1956 up to the present.  They were the awardees in the cadastral proceedings of Lot No. 7778 of the Molave Townsite, Ts-222.  During the said cadastral proceedings, defendant-appellees claimed Lot No. 7778 on the belief that the area they were actually occupying was Lot No. 7778.  As it turned out, however, when the Municipality of Molave relocated the townsite lots in the area in 1992 as a big portion of Lot No. 7778 was used by the government as a public road and as there were many discrepancies in the areas occupied, it was then discovered that defendant-appellees were actually occupying Lot No. 7777.
On June 23, 1992, plaintiff-appellants filed a Complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 92-20-127 for Recovery of Property against defendant-appellees.
On July 19, 1996, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads, thus:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff -
Holding that the rights of the plaintiffs to recover the land registered in their names, have been effectively barred by laches; and
Ordering the dismissal of the above-entitled case.
No pronouncement as to cost.
SO ORDERED.
Aggrieved, plaintiff-appellants filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals assailing the above-decision.  Said appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 55207.
On December 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals, through the then Second Division, rendered a Decision reversing the assailed decision and decreed as follows:
WHEREFORE, the judgment herein appealed from is hereby REVERSED, and judgment is hereby rendered declaring the plaintiffs-appellants to be entitled to the possession of Lot No. 7777 of the Molave Townsite, subject to the rights of the defendants-appellees under Article (sic) 448, 546, 547 and 548 of the New Civil Code.
The records of this case are hereby ordered remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings to determine the rights of the defendants-appellees under the aforesaid article (sic) of the New Civil Code, and to render judgment thereon in accordance with the evidence and this decision.
No pronouncement as to costs.
SO ORDERED.
Defendant-appellees thereafter filed a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court before the Supreme Court docketed as G.R. No. 139601.  On October 18, 1999, the Supreme Court issued a Resolution denying the petition for late filing and lack of appropriate service.
Subsequently, or on February 15, 2000, the Supreme Court Resolution had become final and executory.
Consequently, the case was remanded to the court 
a quo 
and the latter commissioned the Municipal Assessor of Molave, Zamboanga del Sur to determine the value of the improvements introduced by the defendant-appellees.
The Commissioner's Report determined that at the time of ocular inspection, there were three (3) residential buildings constructed on the property in litigation.  During the ocular inspection, plaintiff-appellants' son, Gil Basay, defendant-appellee Virginia Cabang, and one Bernardo Mendez, an occupant of the lot, were present.  In the report, the following appraised value of the improvements were determined, thus:

Thereafter, upon verbal request of defendant-appellees, the court 
a quo 
in its Order declared that the tie point of the survey should be the BLLM (Bureau of Lands Location Monument) and authorized the official surveyor of the Bureau of Lands to conduct the survey of the litigated property.
Pursuant to the above Order, the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)-Region XI designated Geodetic Engineer Diosdado L. de Guzman to [act] as the official surveyor.  On March 2002, Engr. De Guzman submitted his survey report which stated, 
inter alia
:
That on September 18, 2001, the undersigned had conducted verification survey of Lot 7777, Ts-222 and the adjacent lots for reference purposes-with both parties present on the survey;
That the survey was started from BLLM #34, as directed by the Order, taking sideshots of lot corners, existing concrete fence, road and going back to BLLM #34, a point of reference;
Considering that there was only one BLLM existing on the ground, the undersigned conducted astronomical observation on December 27, 2001 in order to check the carried Azimuth of the traverse;
That per result of the survey conducted, it was found out and ascertained that the area occupied by Mrs. Virginia Cabang is a portion of Lot 7777, with lot assignment to be known as Lot 7777-A with an area of 303 square meters and portion of Lot 7778 with lot assignment to be known as Lot 7778-A with an area of 76 square meters.  On the same lot, portion of which is also occupied by Mr. Bernardo Mendez with lot assignment to be known as Lot 7777-B with an area of 236 square meters and Lot 7778-B with an area of 243 square meters as shown on the attached sketch for ready reference;
That there were three (3) houses made of light material erected inside Lot No. 7777-A, which is owned by Mrs. Virginia Cabang and also a concrete house erected both on portion of Lot No. 7777-B and Lot No. 7778-B, which is owned by Mr. Bernardo Mendez. x x x;
That the existing road had been traversing on a portion of Lot 7778 to be know (sic) as Lot 7778-CA-G.R. SP No. with an area of 116 square meters as shown on attached sketch plan.
During the hearing on May 10, 2002, plaintiff-appellants' offer to pay P21,000.00 for the improvement of the lot in question was rejected by defendant-appellees.  The court 
a quo
 disclosed its difficulty in resolving whether or not the houses may be subject of an order of execution it being a family home.
On June 18, 2002, plaintiff-appellants filed their Manifestation and Motion for Execution alleging therein that defendant-appellees refused to accept payment of the improvements as determined by the court appointed Commissioner, thus, they should now be ordered to remove said improvements at their expense or if they refused, an Order of Demolition be issued.
On September 6, 2002, the court 
a quo
 issued the herein assailed Order denying the motion for execution.
[4]
Respondents thereafter elevated their cause to the appellate court which reversed the trial court in its May 31, 2007 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 76755.  Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution
[5]
 dated September 21, 2007.
Hence, this petition.
Petitioners insist that the property subject of the controversy is a duly constituted family home which is not subject to execution, thus, they argue that the appellate tribunal erred in reversing the judgment of the trial court.
The petition lacks merit.
It bears stressing that the purpose for which the records of the case were remanded to the court of origin was for the enforcement of the appellate court's final and executory judgment
[6]
 in CA-G.R. CV No. 55207 which, among others, declared herein respondents 
entitled to the possession
 of Lot No. 7777 of the Molave Townsite subject to the provisions of Articles 448,
[7]
 546,
[8]
 547
[9]
 an 548
[10]
 of the Civil Code.  Indeed, the decision explicitly decreed that the remand of the records of the case was for the court of origin "
[t]o determine the rights of the defendants-appellees under the aforesaid article[s]
 of the New Civil Code, 
and to render judgment thereon 
in accordance with the evidence 
and this decision
.
"
A final and executory judgment may no longer be modified in 
any 
respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court in the land.
[11]
  The only exceptions to this rule are the correction of (1) clerical errors; (2) the so-called 
nunc pro tunc 
entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and (3) void judgments.
[12]
Well-settled is the rule that there can be no execution until and unless the judgment has become final and executory, 
i.e. 
the period of appeal has lapsed without an appeal having been taken, or, having been taken, the appeal has been resolved and the records of the case have been returned to the court of origin, in which event, execution shall issue as a matter of right.
[13]
  In short, once a judgment becomes final, the winning party is entitled to a writ of execution and the issuance thereof becomes a court's 
ministerial 
duty.
[14]
Furthermore, as a matter of settled legal principle, a writ of execution 
must adhere to every essential particulars of the judgment sought to be executed.
[15]
  An order of execution may not vary or go beyond the terns of the judgment it seeks to enforce.
[16]
  A writ of execution 
must conform to the judgment
 and if it is different from, goes beyond or varies the tenor of the judgment which gives it life, it is a nullity.
[17]
  Otherwise stated, when the order of execution and the corresponding writ issued pursuant thereto is not in harmony with and exceeds the judgment which gives it life, they have 
pro tanto 
no validity
[18]
 - to maintain otherwise would be to ignore the constitutional provision against depriving a person of his property without due process of law.
[19]
As aptly pointed out by the appellate court, from the inception of Civil Case No. 99-20-127, 
it was already of judicial notice that the improvements introduced by petitioners on the litigated property are residential houses 
not family homes
.
 Belatedly interposing such an extraneous issue at such a late stage of the proceeding is tantamount to interfering with and varying the terms of the final and executory judgment and a violation of respondents' right to due process because -
As a general rule, points of law, theories and issues not brought to the attention of the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. For a contrary rule would be unfair to the adverse party who would have no opportunity to present further evidence material to the new theory, which it could have done had it been aware of if at the time of the hearing before the trial court.
[20]
 The refusal, therefore, of the trial court to enforce the execution on the ground that the improvements introduced on the litigated property are family homes goes beyond the pale of what it had been expressly tasked to do, 
i.e. 
its 
ministerial 
duty of executing the judgment 
in accordance with its essential particulars
.  The foregoing factual, legal and jurisprudential scenario reduces the raising of the issue of whether or not the improvements introduced by petitioners are family homes into a mere afterthought.
Even squarely addressing the issue of whether or not the improvements introduced by petitioners on the subject land are family homes will not extricate them from their predicament.
As defined, "[T]he family home is a sacred symbol of family love and is the repository of cherished memories that last during one's lifetime.
[21]
  It is the dwelling house where the husband and wife, or an unmarried head of a family reside, including the land on which it is situated.
[22]
  It is constituted jointly by the husband and the wife or by an unmarried head of a family."
[23]
 Article 153 of the Family Code provides that -
The family home is deemed constituted from the time it is occupied as a family residence. From the time of its constitution and so long as any of its beneficiaries actually resides therein, the family home continues to be such and is exempt from execution, forced sale or attachment except as hereinafter provided and to the extent of the value allowed by law.
The actual value of the family home shall not exceed, at the time of its constitution, the amount of P300,000.00 in urban areas and P200,000.00 in rural areas.
[24]
  Under the afore-quoted provision, a family home is deemed constituted on a house and a lot from the time it is occupied as a family residence.  There is no need to constitute the same judicially or extra-judicially.
[25]
There can be no question that a family home is generally exempt from execution,
[26]
 provided it was duly constituted as such.  It is likewise a given that the family home must be constituted on property 
owned
 by the persons constituting it.  Indeed as pointed out in 
Kelley, Jr. v. Planters Products, Inc
.
[27]
  "[T]he family home must be part of the properties of the absolute community or the conjugal partnership, or of the exclusive properties of either spouse with the latter's consent, or on the property of the unmarried head of the family."
[28]
  In other words:
 The family home must be established on the properties of 
(a) the absolute community, or (b) the conjugal partnership, or (c) the exclusive property of either spouse with the consent of the other. 
It cannot be established on property held in co-ownership with third persons.
 However, it can be established partly on community property, or conjugal property and partly on the exclusive property of either spouse with the consent of the latter.
If constituted by an unmarried head of a family, where there is no communal or conjugal property existing, it can be constituted only on his or her own property.
[29]
 (Emphasis and italics supplied)
Therein lies the fatal flaw in the postulate of petitioners.  For all their arguments to the contrary, the stark and immutable fact is that the property on which their alleged family home stands is 
owned by respondents
 and the question of ownership had been long laid to rest with the finality of the appellate court's judgment in CA-G.R. CV No. 55207.  Thus, petitioners' continued stay on the subject land is only by mere tolerance of respondents.
All told, it is too late in the day for petitioners to raise this issue. Without doubt, the instant case where the family home issue has been vigorously pursued by petitioners is but a clear-cut ploy meant to forestall the enforcement of an otherwise final and executory decision.  The execution of a final judgment is a matter of right on the part of the prevailing party whose implementation is 
mandatory
 and 
ministerial
 on the court or tribunal issuing the judgment.
[30]
The most important phase of any proceeding is the execution of judgment.
[31]
  Once a judgment becomes final, the prevailing party should not, through some clever maneuvers devised by an unsporting loser, be deprived of the fruits of the verdict.
[32]
  An unjustified delay in the enforcement of a judgment sets at naught the role of courts in disposing of justiciable controversies with finality.
[33]
  Furthermore, a judgment if not executed would just be an empty victory for the prevailing party because execution is the fruit and end of the suit and very aptly called the life of the law.
[34]
The issue is moreover factual and, to repeat that trite refrain, the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.  It is not the function of the Court to review, examine and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented.  A question of fact would arise in such event.  Questions of fact cannot be raised in an appeal via 
certiorari 
before the Supreme Court and are not proper for its consideration.
[35]
  The rationale behind this doctrine is that a review of the findings of fact of the appellate tribunal is not a function this Court normally undertakes.  The Court will not weigh the evidence all over again unless there is a showing that the findings of the lower court are totally devoid of support or are clearly erroneous so as to constitute serious abuse of discretion.
[36]
  Although there are recognized exceptions
[37]
 to this rule, none exists in this case to justify a departure therefrom.

DENIED
