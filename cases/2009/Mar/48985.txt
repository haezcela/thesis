NACHURA, J.:


A judicial audit was conducted in the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 6, of Tacloban City on November 28 and 29, 2008. Judge Santos T. Gil was Presiding Judge of the court until his retirement on August 20, 2008.
On May 14, 2008, prior to Judge Gil's retirement, Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno designated Judge Alphinor C. Serrano, Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 38, Gamay, Northern Samar, as Assisting Judge of RTC, Branch 6, Tacloban City. He was directed to hear and decide newly filed cases raffled to the said 
sala
 to give Judge Gil the time to decide all cases submitted for decision within four months. Judge Serrano assumed office on July 1, 2008.

In its Report dated February 9, 2009, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found that prior to his retirement, Judge Gilâ

 criminal cases (97-01-07, 89-06-262, 92-05-214, 2001-11-727 and 2000-01-01).
The OCA disclosed that the audit team likewise discovered that several warrants of arrest were in the possession of the Process Server and were not properly indorsed to the concerned police officers; some certificates of detention were signed by Atty. Edna V. Maceda, Branch Clerk of Court; there were no orders directing the payment of postponement fees in civil cases; some motions were not properly received (without stamp of the date of receipt) as in the motion to set bail hearing in Criminal Cases Nos. 04-01-16 and 04-01-62; Pre-Trial Orders (PTOs) were signed only by the judge; records of cases jointly tried are incomplete; there were typographical errors found in several orders; the January to June Semestral Docket Inventory for 2008 manifested wrong case numbers; and the case records were not paginated. There were also firearms, ammunition and illegal drugs, and evidence in decided criminal cases that were still in the possession of the court.
Thus, the OCA made the following recommendations:
That this judicial audit report 
be redocketed
 as an administrative complaint against Retired Judge Santos T. Gil, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 6, Tacloban City, for gross incompetence, inefficiency, negligence and dereliction of duty;
That 
RETIRED JUDGE SANTOS T. GIL
 be

To resolve motions in four (4) criminal and five (5) civil cases;
To decide thirty-four (34) criminal and four (4) civil cases; and
To promulgate the decisions in five (5) criminal cases.

The Court re-docketed the case as an administrative complaint against Judge Gil pursuant to the OCA's recommendation.
The OCA recommendations are well taken.
The Supreme Court has consistently impressed upon judges the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously on the principle that justice delayed is justice denied. Failure to resolve cases submitted for decision within the period fixed by law constitutes a serious violation of the constitutional right of the parties to a speedy disposition of their cases.
[2]
Judge Gil was given 120 days prior to his retirement to decide and resolve the cases submitted for decision, during which period, he was directed to desist from hearing cases. Despite the ample time given, he failed to decide all cases submitted for decision. In fact, upon his retirement, he left unresolved thirty-four (34) criminal cases and four (4) civil cases submitted for decision. Apart from this, Judge Gil also failed to take appropriate action for a considerable length of time in a total of ninety-two (92) criminal cases and seven (7) civil cases; resolve pending motions in nine (9) cases; and promulgate five (5) decisions.
Glaringly, two of the pending criminal cases (Criminal Cases Nos. 93-01-38 and 93-01-39) were submitted for decision way back in 2002 while one civil case (Civil Case No. 92-02-36) was deemed submitted for decision in 1999. In other words, these two criminal cases have been pending resolution for six years, and the civil case for seven years, at the time Judge Gil retired from the service. When viewed in light of the constitutional prescription that lower courts are given only a period of 90 days within which to decide or resolve a case from the time it is submitted for decision, this delay clearly illustrates the gravity of Judge Gil's incompetence.
Verily, a judge must manage his court with a view to the prompt and convenient disposition of its business. The Court, in its pursuit of speedy dispensation of justice, is not unmindful of circumstances that may delay the disposition of the cases assigned to judges. It remains sympathetic to seasonably filed requests for extensions of time to decide cases.
[3]
 However, verification with the Docket Division of the OCA disclosed no such request for extension of time to decide the cases submitted for decision or any pending motions in the reported cases.
Failure to decide cases within the reglementary period, without strong and justifiable reason, constitutes gross inefficiency warranting the imposition of an administrative sanction on the defaulting judge.
[4]
 The penalty imposed varies in each case; from fine, suspension, suspension and fine, and even dismissal, depending chiefly on the number of cases left undecided within the reglementary period, and other factors, such as the damage suffered by the parties as a result of the delay, the health and age of the judge.
[5]
 In view of Judge Gil's retirement on August 20, 2008, the only penalty that we can impose against him is a fine. On various occasions, the Court had imposed different amounts of fine on account of distinct circumstances in certain cases, thus:
[I]n one case, we set the fine at ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) for failure of a judge to decide eighty-two (82) cases within the reglementary period, taking into consideration the mitigating circumstance that it was the judge's first offense. In another case, the fine imposed was sixty thousand pesos (P60,000.00), for the judge had not decided about 25 or 27 cases. Still in other cases, the fine was variably set at fifteen thousand (P15,000.00), for nineteen (19) undecided cases, taking into consideration that it was the judge's first offense, twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00), for three (3) undecided criminal cases; eight thousand pesos (P8,000.00) for not deciding a criminal case for three (3) years; forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00), for not deciding two hundred seventy eight (278) cases within the prescribed period, taking note of the judge's failing health and age; and ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00), for belatedly rendering a judgment of acquittal in a murder case after one year and one-half years from the date the case was submitted for decision. In another case, suspension without pay for a period of six (6) months was imposed since, besides the judge's failure to timely decide an election protest for eight (8) months, the judge submitted false certificates of service and was found guilty of habitual absenteeism.
[6]
Recently, the Court imposed a fine of P80,000.00 on a judge, who has been previously fined twice for undue delay in deciding cases, based on the following lapses: 1) 83 cases were not decided within the reglementary period; (2) pending incidents in 230 other cases remained unresolved even beyond the prescribed period to resolve; and (3) no appropriate action was made on 221 others (193 cases with no further action, 19 cases with no further settings and 9 cases with no action taken yet since the filing thereof), despite the lapse of considerable time.
[7]
Judge Gil's actuations indicate an indifference to the plight of litigants and a blatant disregard of their right to speedy disposition of their cases. Hence, we find that the penalty of P50,000.00 is commensurate to his infractions particularly because this is not the first time that Judge Gil has been sanctioned by this Court for undue delay in resolving cases. Judge Gil has been previously fined P5,000.00 for undue delay in resolving a land registration case.
[8]
  In another case, Judge Gil was also fined P2,000.00 for not complying promptly with an order of this Court to conduct an investigation on an administrative complaint against a lawyer.
[9]
 In both cases, the Court sternly warned Judge Gil that repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.
ACCORDINGLY
, Retired 
JUDGE SANTOS T. GIL
 is hereby found 
GUILTY
 of gross inefficiency for his undue delay in rendering decisions or orders and is hereby 
FINED
 in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
