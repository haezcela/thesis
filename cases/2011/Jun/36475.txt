A compromise agreement is a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions, avoid litigation, or put an end to one already commenced. 
[4]
 Its validity depends on its fulfillment of the requisites and principles of contracts dictated by law; its terms and conditions being not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy and public order. 
[5]
A scrutiny of the aforequoted agreement reveals it is a compromise agreement sanctioned under Article 2028 of the Civil Code. Its terms and conditions are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy and public order. Hence, judgment can be validly rendered thereon.
WHEREFORE
, finding the Agreement to Terminate Action dated April 1, 2011 not to be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy and public order, it is hereby 
APPROVED
 and judgment is rendered based on said agreement which is final and immediately executory. The parties are enjoined to comply strictly and in good faith with the terms, conditions and stipulations contained therein. Accordingly, the complaint for recovery of shares of stock and damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 2006-010, before the RTC, Branch 17 in Cagayan de Oro City is hereby
