NACHURA, J.:



Before the Court is an earnest plea
[1]

  of respondent Jeoffrey S. Joaquino (Joaquino), Clerk of Court of the 
Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 18, Cebu City, seeking 
reconsideration of the Resolutions
[2]
  of the Court dated August 11, 2010 and February 7, 2011. 


Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) filed a verified letter- 
complaint before the Office of the Court Administrator, charging Clerk 
of Court Joaquino with grave misconduct, abuse of authority, and gross 
ignorance of the law; and Sheriff IV Constancio V. Alimurung (Alimurung)
 with grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of 
the service relative to Civil Case No. CEB-29383, entitled 
âSpouses 
Florentino J. Palacio and Ellen Palacio, Palacio Shipping, Inc., and FJP
 Lines, Inc. v. Development Bank of the Philippines,â
 for damages, 
judicial determination of amount of obligation, 
nullity/annulment/reformation of instruments and agreements, bloated 
principal obligation, excessive interest rates and penalties, judicial 
accounting and application of payment, specific performance, 
extinguishment of obligations, and attorneyâs fees. A brief background 
of Civil Case No. CEB-29383 is quoted herein, viz.: 


The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) is the 
defendant in Civil Case No. CEB-29383, filed with the Regional Trial 
Court, Branch 21, Cebu City, presided by Judge Eric F. Menchavez.  The 
civil action (
Annex A, Complaint
) was filed, on 15 September 
2003, by the FJP Lines and the spouses Palacio against DBP for Damages, 
Judicial Determination of Amount of Obligation, Specific Performance, 
etc. DBP, through Atty. Tejada, its Chief Legal Counsel, filed its 
Answer (
Annex B, Ibid
) with Specific Affirmative Defenses and interposed Compulsory Counterclaim.


The plaintiff moved for Partial Summary Judgment on the issue of 
insurance proceeds, but defendant opposed the same.  On 6 September 
2006, the trial court rendered a Partial Summary Judgment (
Annex C, Ibid
);
 in favor of the plaintiff by directing defendant DBP to immediately 
release to FJP Lines the GSIS insurance proceeds due to M/V Don Martin 
Sr. 9.  DBP asked for reconsideration but the same was denied in an 
Order (
Annex D, Ibid
), dated 8 December 2006.  Not persuaded, DBP filed a Notice of Appeal (
Annex E, Ibid
).


On 19 December 2006, the plaintiff moved for execution pending appeal
 of the partial judgment.  This was granted by the trial court in the 
Order of 29 January 2007 (
Annex F, Ibid
).  A motion for reconsideration was filed by DBP but the same was denied in the Order of 12 March 2007.


Respondent Joaquino issued, on 21 March 2007, a Writ of Execution (
Annex G, Ibid
)
 to enforce the partial judgment.  To avoid execution, DBP filed an 
Urgent Motion to Stay Discretionary Execution with Alternative Motion 
for the Approval of Supersedeas  Bond.  The trial court denied the 
motion in an Order, dated 26 March 2007.  Aggrieved, DBP filed a 
Petition for Certiorari (docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 02604) before the 
Court of Appeals, Cebu City Station, to assail the Orders, dated 29 
January and 12 March 2007.


In the meantime, Sheriff IV Romeo C. Asombrado of the Regional Trial 
Court, Branch 21, Cebu City, in compliance with the Writ of Execution, 
dated 21 March 2007, demanded, on 23 March 2007, from DBP the immediate 
and full satisfaction of the partial judgment and served the 
corresponding Notice of Garnishment (
Annex H, Ibid
).


In a Decision (
Annex I, Ibid
), dated 20 July 2007, in CA-G.R. 
SP No. 02604, the Court of Appeals annulled and set aside the Orders, 
dated 29 January and 12 March 2007, as well as the writs and processes 
subsequently issued for the implementation of the said Orders.  FJP 
Lines seasonably filed a motion of reconsideration, but the same was 
denied.


On 13 November 2007, FJP Lines moved to dismiss DBPâs appeal, which motion was granted in an Order, dated 6 March 2008 (
Annex J, Ibid
).  Unconvinced, DBP sought the reconsideration (
Annex K, Ibid
) of the said Order.


On 17 March 2008, respondent Joaquino issued another Writ of 
Execution to implement the Partial Judgment of 6 September 2006.  The 
same was served to defendant DBP by respondent Alimurung (
Annex L, Ibid
).


In an Order (
Annex N, Ibid
), dated 4 April 2008, Judge 
Menchavez inhibited himself from handling Civil Case No. CEB-29383 and 
ordered that the pending incident, relative to the issuance and 
implementation of the writ of execution, be addressed to the court where
 the case will be re-raffled.  On the same day, pursuant to the 17 March
 2008 Writ of Execution, respondent Alimurung served a copy of the 
Notice of Sheriffâs Sale at Public Auction (
Annex O, Ibid
) to 
DBPâs Regional Marketing Center in Central Visayas, informing it that 
its proprietary shares in Cebu Country Club would be sold at public 
auction on 8 April 2008.  In a Letter (
Annex P, Ibid
), dated 8 
April 2008, DBP manifested to respondent Alimurung its objection to the 
auction sale, considering that the partial judgment, dated 6 September 
2006, sought to be implemented, was not yet final and executory.  
However, despite such notice, Sheriff Alimurung proceeded with the 
scheduled auction sale (
Annex Q, Ibid
).


DBP filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration of the Order, 
dated 6 March 2008 (which denied its Notice of Appeal) with an 
Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Preliminary 
Injunction to enjoin respondent Alimurung from proceeding with the 
enforcement of the Writ of Execution, dated 17 March 2008.  During the 
hearing on the TRO, respondent Alimurung âboldly manifested in open 
court that he [was] bent on further implementing the Writ of Execution 
dated March 17, 2008 against DBP.â


On 16 April 2008, respondent Alimurung again issued a Notice of 
Sheriffâs Sale at Public Auction over several parcels of land belonging 
[to] DBP.


To prevent further damage, DBP, on 18 April 2008, filed before the 
Court of Appeals, Cebu City Station, a Petition for Injunction with 
Prayer for TRO/Injunction against Spouses Palacio, LJP Lines, and 
respondent Joaquino and Alimurung (docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 03411).
[3]


On August 11, 2010, the Court issued a Resolution
[4]
,  the 
fallo
 of which reads:


The Court 
RESOLVES
 to 
ADOPT
 and 
APPROVE

 the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation of the 
Office of the Court Administrator in the attached Report dated 27 
January 2010 (Annex âAâ).  Accordingly, the Court further resolves to:


1.  
RE-DOCKET
 the instant administrative complaint as a regular administrative matter;


2.  
FIND
 respondent Jeoffrey S. Joaquino, Clerk of Court VII, OCC, RTC, Cebu City, 
GUILTY
 of gross ignorance of the Rules and dereliction of duty and accordingly impose on him the penalty of 
SUSPENSION
 for six (6) months without pay, with 
WARNING
 that a repetition of the same or similar offense in the future shall merit his dismissal from the service; and 


3. 
DISMISS
 the complaint against respondent Constancio V. Alimurung, Sheriff IV, RTC, Br. 18, Cebu City, for lack of merit.


SO ORDERED
.
[5]
 


Respondent Joaquino filed a motion for reconsideration; while DBP 
filed a partial motion for reconsideration, assailing the dismissal of 
the complaint against Sheriff Alimurung. On February 7, 2011, the Court 
issued a Resolution
[6]
 denying both motions with finality for lack of substantial merit. 


On April 13, 2011, respondent Joaquino filed a second motion for 
reconsideration, raising the following grounds in support of his motion:
 (1) that he issued the questioned March 17, 2008 writ of execution 
based on his honest reliance on and obedience to the September 6, 2006 
Order of the RTC, granting the partial summary judgment, and the March 
6, 2008 Order of the RTC, declaring the partial summary judgment final 
and executory, and directing the issuance of a writ of execution; (2) 
that the penalty of six (6) months without pay is too harsh and severe 
for the violation charged against him, based on the penalty imposed in 
Separa v. Atty. Maceda.
[7]
 


Out of compassion, we take a second look at the penalty imposed on 
Clerk of Court Joaquino. A review of the penalty imposed on court 
employees who were administrably charged is justified, 
viz.
: 


In 
Separa
, an administrative complaint was filed against 
respondents Branch Clerk of Court and Sheriffs for usurpation of 
authority, falsification, and gross ignorance of the law for declaring 
the Gualbertos as the lawful owner of Lot 1991-A, when the judgment 
sought to be enforced was the decision in another trial court which 
merely dismissed the case.
[8]
 
 The amended writ of execution issued by the Branch Clerk of Court 
directed the implementation of a decision which had already been set 
aside by the appellate court and subsequently dismissed by the RTC. 
Hence, the amended writ was void for two reasons: (1) the amended writ 
went beyond the order granting execution; and (2) respondent Branch 
Clerk of Court was not clothed with authority to issue the amended writ.
[9]

  The Supreme Court imposed a fine of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) on
 respondent Branch Clerk of Court for having issued the amended writ, 
which directed the execution of the judgment of another court.
[10]
 


In 
Leyrit v. Solas
,
[11]

  the Branch Clerk of Court was held liable for simple misconduct. The 
Court imposed a fine equivalent to his three (3) monthsâ salary to be 
deducted from his retirement benefits. 


In 
Aquino-Simbulan v. Bartolome
,
[12]

  the presiding judge and the clerk of court (retired) were found guilty
 of gross negligence. Both were meted a fine in the amount of Forty 
Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00), to be deducted from their retirement 
benefits. 


In 
Heirs of Spouses Jose and Concepcion Olorga v. Beldia, Jr.
,
[13]

  respondent judge was found liable for simple misconduct for his 
violation of Canons 1, 11, and 12 of the Code of Professional 
Responsibility. He was meted a fine of Fifteen Thousand Pesos 
(P15,000.00).


In 
Andres v. Majaducon
, respondent judge was held liable for abuse of authority and was fined Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00). 


In 
Pastor C. Pinlac v. Oscar T. Llamas, Cash Clerk II, Regional 
Trial Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, San Carlos City, Pangasinan,
[14]
 then Cash Clerk II of the RTC was found guilty of grave misconduct and was accordingly meted a fine of P20,000.00. 


Considering the circumstances attendant to this case, and in the 
spirit of compassion, we resolve to lower the penalty imposed on 
respondent Joaquino based on the recent pronouncements of the Court. A 
penalty of  a fine of TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00) is reasonable, 
considering the fact that he simply issued the writ of execution based 
on the March 6, 2008 Order
[15]
 of the RTC, which reads:


WHEREFORE, defendantâs [DBPâs] notice of appeal filed
 on December 18, 2006 is dismissed. The assailed Partial Summary 
Judgment dated September 6, 2006 having become final and executory, let a
 writ of execution issue against the defendant.


SO ORDERED.
[16]
 


However, respondent Joaquino is sternly warned that a repetition of 
the same or similar offense in the future shall merit his dismissal from
 the service. Clerks of court occupy a sensitive position in the 
judicial system, they are required to safeguard the integrity of the 
court and its proceedings, to earn and preserve respect therefor, to 
maintain loyalty thereto and to the judge as superior officer, to 
maintain the authenticity and correctness of court records, and to 
uphold the confidence of the public in the administration of justice. 
Clerks of court play a key role in the complement of the court and, 
thus, cannot be permitted to slacken on their jobs under one pretext or 
another.
[17]
 


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the penalty imposed on 
respondent Jeoffrey S. Joaquino, Clerk of Court VII, Office of the Clerk
 of Court, RTC, Cebu City, is hereby modified. Accordingly, he is hereby
 ordered to pay a 
FINE
 of 
TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00)
, with a 
WARNING
 that a repetition of the same or similar offense in the future shall merit his dismissal from the service.


SO ORDERED.
