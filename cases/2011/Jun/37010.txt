ATTY. ROMULO B. MACALINTAL, PETITIONER, VS. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




NACHURA, J.:


Before us is a Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioner Atty. Romulo B. Macalintal of our Decision
[1]
 in
 G.R. No. 191618 dated November 23, 2010, dismissing his petition and 
declaring the establishment of respondent Presidential Electoral 
Tribunal (PET) as constitutional.


Petitioner reiterates his arguments on the alleged unconstitutional creation of the PET:


1.He has standing to file the petition as a taxpayer and a concerned citizen.

2. He is not estopped from assailing the constitution of the PET 
simply by virtue of his appearance as counsel of former president Gloria
 Macapagal-Arroyo before respondent tribunal.


3. Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution does not provide for the creation of the PET. 


4. The PET violates Section 12, Article VIII of the Constitution.


To bolster his arguments that the PET is an illegal and unauthorized 
progeny of Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution, petitioner 
invokes our ruling on the constitutionality of the Philippine Truth 
Commission (PTC).
[2] 
Petitioner
 cites the concurring opinion of Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-de Castro 
that the PTC is a public office which cannot be created by the 
President, the power to do so being lodged exclusively with Congress. 
Thus, petitioner submits that if the President, as head of the Executive
 Department, cannot create the PTC, the Supreme Court, likewise, cannot 
create the PET in the absence of an act of legislature.


On the other hand, in its Comment to the Motion for Reconsideration, the Office of the Solicitor General maintains that:




1.Petitioner is without standing to file the petition.


2.Petitioner is estopped from assailing the jurisdiction of the PET.


3.The constitution of the PET is "on firm footing on the basis of the
 grant of authority to the [Supreme] Court to be the sole judge of all 
election contests for the President or Vice-President under paragraph 7,
 Section 4, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution."




Except for the invocation of our decision in Louis 
?Barok" C. Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010,
[3]
 petitioner does not allege new arguments to warrant reconsideration of our Decision.


We cannot agree with his insistence that the creation of the PET is 
unconstitutional. We reiterate that the abstraction of the Supreme Court
 acting as a 
Presidential Electoral Tribunal
 from the unequivocal
 grant of jurisdiction in the last paragraph of Section 4, Article VII 
of the Constitution is sound and tenable. The provision reads:


Sec. 4. x x x. 


The Supreme Court, sitting 
en banc,
 shall be the sole judge of
 all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of 
the President or Vice-President, and may promulgate its rules for the 
purpose.


We mapped out the discussions of the Constitutional Commission on the foregoing provision and concluded therefrom that:


The 
mirabile dictu
 of the grant of 
jurisdiction to this Court, albeit found in the Article on the executive
 branch of government, and the constitution of the PET, is evident in 
the discussions of the Constitutional Commission. On the exercise of 
this Courtâs judicial power as sole judge of presidential and 
vice-presidential election contests, and to promulgate its rules for 
this purpose, we find the proceedings in the Constitutional Commission 
most instructive:


MR. DAVIDE. On line 25, after the words "Vice-President," I propose 
to add AND MAY PROMULGATE ITS RULES FOR THE PURPOSE. This refers to the 
Supreme Court sitting 
en banc.
 
This is also to confer on the 
Supreme Court exclusive authority to enact the necessary rules while 
acting as sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns 
and qualifications of the President or Vice-President.


MR. REGALADO. 
My personal position is that the rule-making power 
of the Supreme Court with respect to its internal procedure is already 
implicit under the Article on the Judiciary; considering, however, that 
according to the Commissioner, the purpose of this is to indicate the 
sole power of the Supreme Court without intervention by the legislature 
in the promulgation of its rules on this particular point, I think I 
will personally recommend its acceptance to the Committee.


x  x  x  x


MR. NOLLEDO x x x.


With respect to Sections 10 and 11 on page 8, I understand that the 
Committee has also created an Electoral Tribunal in the Senate and a 
Commission on Appointments which may cover membership from both Houses. 
But my question is: It seems to me that the committee report does not 
indicate which body should promulgate the rules that shall govern the 
Electoral Tribunal and the Commission on Appointments. Who shall then 
promulgate the rules of these bodies?


MR. DAVIDE. 
The Electoral Tribunal itself will establish and 
promulgate its rules because it is a body distinct and independent 
already from the House, and so with the Commission on Appointments also.
 It will have the authority to promulgate its own rules.
On another point of discussion relative to the grant of judicial 
power, but equally cogent, we listen to former Chief Justice Roberto 
Concepcion:


MR. SUAREZ. Thank you.


Would the Commissioner not consider that violative of the doctrine of separation of powers?


MR. CONCEPCION. 
I think Commissioner Bernas explained that this is a contest between two parties. This is a judicial power.


MR. SUAREZ. We know, but practically the Committee is giving to the 
judiciary the right to declare who will be the President of our country,
 which to me is a political action.


MR. CONCEPCION. 
There are legal rights which are enforceable under the law, and these are essentially justiciable questions.


MR. SUAREZ. 
If the election contest proved to be long, burdensome and tedious, practically all the time of the Supreme Court sitting 
en banc

 would be occupied with it considering that they will be going over 
millions and millions of ballots or election returns, Madam President.
Echoing the same sentiment and affirming the grant of judicial power 
to the Supreme Court, Justice Florenz D. Regalado and Fr. Joaquin Bernas
 both opined:


MR. VILLACORTA. Thank you very much, Madam President.


I am not sure whether Commissioner Suarez has expressed his point. On page 2, the fourth paragraph of Section 4 provides:


The Supreme Court, sitting 
en banc,
 shall be the sole judge of
 all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of 
the President or Vice-President.


May I seek clarification as to whether or not the matter of 
determining the outcome of the contests relating to the election returns
 and qualifications of the President or Vice-President is purely a 
political matter and, therefore, should not be left entirely to the 
judiciary. Will the above-quoted provision not impinge on the doctrine 
of separation of powers between the executive and the judicial 
departments of the government?


MR. REGALADO. 
No, I really do not feel that would be a problem. 
This is a new provision incidentally. It was not in the 1935 
Constitution nor in the 1973 Constitution.
 


MR. VILLACORTA. That is right.


MR. REGALADO. 
We feel that it will not be an intrusion into the 
separation of powers guaranteed to the judiciary because this is 
strictly an adversarial and judicial proceeding.


MR. VILLACORTA. May I know the rationale of the Committee because 
this supersedes Republic Act 7950 which provides for the Presidential 
Electoral Tribunal?


FR. BERNAS. 
Precisely, this is necessary. Election contests are, 
by their nature, judicial. Therefore, they are cognizable only by 
courts. If, for instance, we did not have a constitutional provision on 
an electoral tribunal for the Senate or an electoral tribunal for the 
House, normally, as composed, that cannot be given jurisdiction over 
contests.


So, the background of this is really the case of 
Roxas v. Lopez.

 The Gentleman will remember that in that election, Lopez was declared 
winner. He filed a protest before the Supreme Court because there was a 
republic act which created the Supreme Court as the Presidential 
Electoral Tribunal. The question in this case was whether new powers 
could be given the Supreme Court by law. In effect, the conflict was 
actually whether there was an attempt to create two Supreme Courts and 
the answer of the Supreme Court was: "No, this did not involve the 
creation of two Supreme Courts, but precisely we are giving new 
jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, as it is allowed by the Constitution.
 Congress may allocate various jurisdictions."


Before the passage of that republic act, in case there was any 
contest between two presidential candidates or two vice-presidential 
candidates, no one had jurisdiction over it. 
So, it became necessary 
to create a Presidential Electoral Tribunal. What we have done is to 
constitutionalize what was statutory but it is not an infringement on 
the separation of powers because the power being given to the Supreme 
Court is a judicial power.


Unmistakable from the foregoing is that the exercise of our power to 
judge presidential and vice-presidential election contests, as well as 
the rule-making power adjunct thereto, is plenary; it is not as 
restrictive as petitioner would interpret it. In fact, former Chief 
Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., who proposed the insertion of the 
phrase, intended the Supreme Court to exercise exclusive authority to 
promulgate its rules of procedure for that purpose. To this, Justice 
Regalado forthwith assented and then emphasized that the sole power 
ought to be without intervention by the legislative department. 
Evidently, even the legislature cannot limit the judicial power to 
resolve presidential and vice-presidential election contests and our 
rule-making power connected thereto.


To foreclose all arguments of petitioner, we reiterate that the 
establishment of the PET simply constitutionalized what was statutory 
before the 1987 Constitution. The experiential context of the PET in our
 country cannot be denied.
[4]


Stubbornly, despite the explicit reference of the Members of the Constitutional Commission to a 
Presidential Electoral Tribunal,

 with Fr. Joaquin Bernas categorically declaring that in crafting the 
last paragraph of Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution, they 
"constitutionalize[d] what was statutory," petitioner continues to 
insist that the last paragraph of Section 4, Article VII of the 
Constitution does not provide for the creation of the PET. Petitioner is
 adamant that "the fact that [the provision] does not expressly prohibit
 [the] creation [of the PET] is not an authority for the Supreme Court 
to create the same."


Petitioner is going to town under the misplaced assumption that the 
text of the provision itself was the only basis for this Court to 
sustain the PETâs constitutionality.


We reiterate that the PET is authorized by the last paragraph of 
Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution and as supported by the 
discussions of the Members of the Constitutional Commission, which 
drafted the present Constitution.


The explicit reference by the framers of our Constitution to 
constitutionalizing what was merely statutory before is not diluted by 
the absence of a phrase, line or word, mandating the Supreme Court to 
create a 
Presidential Electoral Tribunal.


Suffice it to state that the Constitution, verbose as it already is, 
cannot contain the specific wording required by petitioner in order for 
him to accept the constitutionality of the PET.


In our Decision, we clarified the structure of the PET:


Be that as it may, we hasten to clarify the structure of the PET as a
 legitimate progeny of Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution, 
composed of members of the Supreme Court, sitting en banc. The following
 exchange in the 1986 Constitutional Commission should provide 
enlightenment:


MR. SUAREZ. Thank you. Let me proceed to line 23, page 2, wherein it is provided, and I quote:


The Supreme Court, sitting en banc[,] shall be the sole judge of all 
contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the 
President or Vice-President.


Are we not giving enormous work to the Supreme Court especially 
when it is directed to sit en banc as the sole judge of all presidential
 and vice-presidential election contests?


MR. SUMULONG. That question will be referred to Commissioner Concepcion.


MR. CONCEPCION. 
This function was discharged by the Supreme Court 
twice and the Supreme Court was able to dispose of each case in a period
 of one year as provided by law. Of course, that was probably during the
 late 1960s and early 1970s. I do not know how the present Supreme Court
 would react to such circumstances, but there is also the question of 
who else would hear the election protests.


MR. SUAREZ. We are asking this question because between lines 23 to 
25, there are no rules provided for the hearings and there is not time 
limit or duration for the election contest to be decided by the Supreme 
Court. Also, we will have to consider the historical background that 
when R.A. 1793, which organized the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, was
 promulgated on June 21, 1957, at least three famous election contests 
were presented and two of them ended up in withdrawal by the protestants
 out of sheer frustration because of the delay in the resolution of the 
cases. I am referring to the electoral protest that was lodged by former
 President Carlos P. Garcia against our "kabalen" former President 
Diosdado Macapagal in 1961 and the vice-presidential election contest 
filed by the late Senator Gerardo Roxas against Vice-President Fernando 
Lopez in 1965.


MR. CONCEPCION. I cannot answer for what the protestants had in mind.
 But when that protest of Senator Roxas was withdrawn, the results were 
already available. Senator Roxas did not want to have a decision adverse
 to him. The votes were being counted already, and he did not get what 
he expected so rather than have a decision adverse to his protest, he 
withdrew the case.


x x x x


MR. SUAREZ. 
I see. So the Commission would not have any objection 
to vesting in the Supreme Court this matter of resolving presidential 
and vice-presidential contests?


MR. CONCEPCION. Personally, I would not have any objection.


MR. SUAREZ. Thank you.


Would the Commissioner not consider that violative of the doctrine of separation of powers?


MR. CONCEPCION. I think Commissioner Bernas explained that this is a contest between two parties. This is a judicial power.


MR. SUAREZ. We know, but practically the Committee is giving to the 
judiciary the right to declare who will be the President of our country,
 which to me is a political action.


MR. CONCEPCION. There are legal rights which are enforceable under the law, and these are essentially justiciable questions.


MR. SUAREZ. 
If the election contest proved to be long, burdensome 
and tedious, practically all the time of the Supreme Court sitting en 
banc would be occupied with it considering that they will be going over 
millions and millions of ballots or election returns, Madam President.


MR. CONCEPCION. The time consumed or to be consumed in this contest 
for President is dependent upon they key number of teams of revisors. I 
have no experience insofar as contests in other offices are concerned.


MR. SUAREZ. Although there is a requirement here that the Supreme Court is mandated to sit en banc?


MR. CONCEPCION. Yes.


MR. SUAREZ. I see.


MR. CONCEPCION.
 The steps involved in this contest are: First, the
 ballot boxes are opened before teams of three, generally, a 
representative each of the court, of the protestant and of the 
"protestee." It is all a questions of how many teams are organized. Of 
course, that can be expensive, but it would be expensive whatever court 
one would choose. There were times that the Supreme Court, with 
sometimes 50 teams at the same time working, would classify the 
objections, the kind of problems, and the court would only go over the 
objected votes on which the parties could not agree. So it is not as 
awesome as it would appear insofar as the Court is concerned. What is 
awesome is the cost of the revision of the ballots because each party 
would have to appoint one representative for every team, and that may 
take quite a big amount.


MR. SUAREZ. If we draw from the Commissioner's experience which he is
 sharing with us, what would be the reasonable period for the election 
contest to be decided?


MR. CONCEPCION. Insofar as the Supreme Court is concerned, the Supreme Court always manages to dispose of the case in one year.


MR. SUAREZ. In one year. Thank you for the clarification.
[5]


Judicial power granted to the Supreme Court by the same Constitution is plenary. And under the 
doctrine of necessary implication,

 the additional jurisdiction bestowed by the last paragraph of Section 
4, Article VII of the Constitution to decide presidential and 
vice-presidential elections contests includes the means necessary to 
carry it into effect. Thus:


Obvious from the foregoing is the intent to bestow 
independence to the Supreme Court as the PET, to undertake the Herculean
 task of deciding election protests involving presidential and 
vice-presidential candidates in accordance with the process outlined by 
former Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion. It was made in response to the 
concern aired by delegate Jose E. Suarez that the additional duty may 
prove too burdensome for the Supreme Court. This explicit grant of 
independence and of the plenary powers needed to discharge this burden 
justifies the budget allocation of the PET.


The conferment of additional jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, with 
the duty characterized as an "awesome" task, includes the means 
necessary to carry it into effect under the 
doctrine of necessary implication.

 We cannot overemphasize that the abstraction of the PET from the 
explicit grant of power to the Supreme Court, given our abundant 
experience, is not unwarranted.


A plain reading of Article VII, Section 4, paragraph 7, readily 
reveals a grant of authority to the Supreme Court sitting en banc. In 
the same vein, although the method by which the Supreme Court exercises 
this authority is not specified in the provision, the grant of power 
does not contain any limitation on the Supreme Court's exercise thereof.
 The Supreme Court's method of deciding presidential and 
vice-presidential election contests, through the PET, is actually a 
derivative of the exercise of the prerogative conferred by the 
aforequoted constitutional provision. Thus, the subsequent directive in 
the provision for the Supreme Court to "promulgate its rules for the 
purpose."


The conferment of full authority to the Supreme Court, as a PET, is 
equivalent to the full authority conferred upon the electoral tribunals 
of the Senate and the House of Representatives, i.e., the Senate 
Electoral Tribunal (SET) and the House of Representatives Electoral 
Tribunal (HRET), which we have affirmed on numerous occasions.
[6]


Next, petitioner still claims that the PET exercises quasi-judicial 
power and, thus, its members violate the proscription in Section 12, 
Article VIII of the Constitution, which reads:


SEC. 12. The Members of the Supreme Court and of 
other courts established by law shall not be designated to any agency 
performing quasi-judicial or administrative functions.


We dispose of this argument as we have done in our Decision, viz.:


The traditional grant of judicial power is found in Section 1, 
Article VIII of the Constitution which provides that the power "shall be
 vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be 
established by law." Consistent with our presidential system of 
government, the function of "dealing with the settlement of disputes, 
controversies or conflicts involving rights, duties or prerogatives that
 are legally demandable and enforceable" is apportioned to courts of 
justice. With the advent of the 1987 Constitution, judicial power was 
expanded to include "the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual 
controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and 
enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the 
part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government." The power was 
expanded, but it remained absolute.


The set up embodied in the Constitution and statutes 
characterizes the resolution of electoral contests as essentially an exercise of judicial power.


At the 
barangay
 and municipal levels, original and exclusive jurisdiction over election contests is vested in the municipal or 
metropolitan trial courts and the regional trial courts, respectively.


At the higher levels - city, provincial, and regional, as well as 
congressional and senatorial - exclusive and original jurisdiction is 
lodged in the COMELEC and in the House of Representatives and Senate 
Electoral Tribunals, 
which are not, strictly and literally speaking, courts of law. Although not courts of law,

 they are, nonetheless, empowered to resolve election contests which 
involve, in essence, an exercise of judicial power, because of the 
explicit constitutional empowerment found in Section 2(2), Article IX-C 
(for the COMELEC) and Section 17, Article VI (for the Senate and House 
Electoral Tribunals) of the Constitution. Besides, when the COMELEC, the
 HRET, and the SET decide election contests, their decisions are still 
subject to judicial review - 
via
 a petition for 
certiorari

 filed by the proper party - if there is a showing that the decision was
 rendered with grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack or excess of
 jurisdiction.


It is also beyond cavil that when the Supreme Court, as PET, resolves
 a presidential or vice-presidential election contest, it performs what 
is essentially a judicial power. In the landmark case of 
Angara v. Electoral Commission,

 Justice Jose P. Laurel enucleated that "it would be inconceivable if 
the Constitution had not provided for a mechanism by which to direct the
 course of government along constitutional channels." In fact, 
Angara

 pointed out that "[t]he Constitution is a definition of the powers of 
government." And yet, at that time, the 1935 Constitution did not 
contain the expanded definition of judicial power found in Article VIII,
 Section 1, paragraph 2 of the present Constitution.


With the explicit provision, the present Constitution has allocated 
to the Supreme Court, in conjunction with latter's exercise of judicial 
power inherent in all courts, the task of deciding presidential and 
vice-presidential election contests, with full authority in the exercise
 thereof. The power wielded by PET is a derivative of the plenary 
judicial power 
allocated to courts of law,
 expressly provided in 
the Constitution. On the whole, the Constitution draws a thin, but, 
nevertheless, distinct line between the PET and the Supreme Court.


If the logic of petitioner is to be followed, all Members of the 
Court, sitting in the Senate and House Electoral Tribunals would violate
 the constitutional proscription found in Section 12, Article VIII. 
Surely, the petitioner will be among the first to acknowledge that this 
is not so. The Constitution which, in Section 17, Article VI, explicitly
 provides that three Supreme Court Justices shall sit in the Senate and 
House Electoral Tribunals, respectively, effectively exempts the 
Justices-Members thereof from the prohibition in Section 12, Article 
VIII. In the same vein, it is the Constitution itself, in Section 4, 
Article VII, which exempts the Members of the Court, constituting the 
PET, from the same prohibition.


We have previously declared that the PET is not simply an agency to 
which Members of the Court were designated. Once again, the PET, as 
intended by the framers of the Constitution, is to be an institution 
independent, but not separate,
 from the judicial department, i.e., the Supreme Court. 
McCulloch v. State of Maryland

 proclaimed that "[a] power without the means to use it, is a nullity." 
The vehicle for the exercise of this power, as intended by the 
Constitution and specifically mentioned by the Constitutional 
Commissioners during the discussions on the grant of power to this 
Court, is the PET. Thus, a microscopic view, like the petitioner's, 
should not constrict an absolute and constitutional grant of judicial 
power.
[7]


Finally, petitionerâs application of our decision in 
Biraogo v. Philippine Truth Commission
[8]
 to the present case is an unmitigated quantum leap.


The decision therein held that the PTC "finds justification under 
Section 17, Article VII of the Constitution." A plain reading of the 
constitutional provisions, i.e., last paragraph of Section 4 and Section
 17, both of Article VII on the Executive Branch, reveals that the two 
are differently worded and deal with separate powers of the Executive 
and the Judicial Branches of government. And as previously adverted to, 
the basis for the constitution of the PET was, in fact, mentioned in the
 deliberations of the Members of the Constitutional Commission during 
the drafting of the present Constitution.
