SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 180282, April 11, 2011 ]


CRISPIN DICHOSO, JR., EVELYN DICHOSO VALDEZ, AND ROSEMARIE DICHOSO PE BENITO, PETITIONERS,vs.PATROCINIO L. MARCOS, RESPONDENT.




NACHURA, J.:


This is a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to reverse and set aside the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision
[1]
 dated January 31, 2007 and Resolution
[2]
 dated October 23, 2007 in CA-G.R. CV No. 85471.  The assailed Decision reversed and set aside the July 15, 2005 decision
[3]

 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Laoag City, Branch 14, in Civil 
Case No. 12581-14; while the assailed Resolution denied the Motion for 
Reconsideration filed by petitioners Crispin Dichoso, Jr., Evelyn 
Dichoso Valdez, and Rosemarie Dichoso Pe Benito.
  
The facts of the case, as culled from the records, are as follows:


On August 2, 2002, petitioners filed a Complaint for Easement of Right of Way
[4]

 against respondent Patrocinio L. Marcos. In their complaint, 
petitioners alleged that they are the owners of Lot No. 21553 of the 
Cadastral Survey of Laoag City, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title
 No. T-31219; while respondent is the owner of Lot No. 1. As petitioners
 had no access to a public road to and from their property, they claimed
 to have used a portion of Lot No. 1 in accessing the road since 1970. 
Respondent, however, blocked the passageway with piles of sand. Though 
petitioners have been granted another passageway by the spouses Benjamin
 and Sylvia Arce (Spouses Arce), the owners of another adjacent lot, 
designated as Lot No. 21559-B, the former instituted the complaint 
before the RTC and  prayed that: 




WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that judgment be rendered:


1. Granting the plaintiffs[â] right of way over an area of 54 
square meters more or less of Lot 01 by paying the defendant the amount 
of P54,000.00, and that the right [of] way be annotated on defendantâs 
title;


 2. Ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P30,000.00 as damages for attorneyâs fees and costs of suit;


Other reliefs, just and equitable under the premises, are likewise sought.
[5]




Instead of filing an Answer, respondent moved for the dismissal
[6]

 of the complaint on the ground of lack of cause of action and 
noncompliance with the requisite certificate of non-forum shopping.
  



During the hearing on respondentâs motion to dismiss, the parties 
agreed that an ocular inspection of the subject properties be conducted.
 After the inspection, the RTC directed the parties to submit their 
respective position papers.


 In a resolution
[7]
 dated May 12, 2004, the RTC denied respondentâs motion to dismiss and required the latter to answer petitionersâ complaint.


In his Answer,
[8]
 
respondent denied that he allowed anybody to use Lot No. 1 as 
passageway. He stated that petitionersâ claim of right of way is only 
due to expediency and not necessity. He also maintained that there is an
 existing easement of right of way available to petitioners granted by 
the Spouses Arce. Thus, there is no need to establish another easement 
over respondentâs property.


 In an Order
[9]
 dated 
July 6, 2005, the RTC declared that respondentâs answer failed to tender
 an issue, and opted to render judgment on the pleadings and thus deemed
 the case submitted for decision.


On July 15, 2005, the RTC rendered a decision
[10]
 in favor of petitioners, the dispositive portion of which reads, as follows: 




WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered, as follows:


1.granting plaintiffs a right of way over an area of 54 square 
meters more or less over Lot 01 owned by defendant Patrocinio L. 
[Marcos] appearing in the Laoag City City Assessorâs sketch (Annex A) 
found on page 28 of the records of the case;


2.ordering plaintiffs to pay defendant the amount of P54,000.00 as proper indemnity; and


3.ordering the Register of Deeds of Laoag City to duly annotate this right of way on defendantâs title to the property.


SO ORDERED.
[11]




The RTC found that petitioners adequately established the 
requisites to justify an easement of right of way in accordance with 
Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code. The trial court likewise 
declared petitioners in good faith as they expressed their willingness 
to pay proper indemnity.
[12]
 


On appeal, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC decision and 
consequently dismissed petitionersâ complaint. Considering that a right 
of way had already been granted by the (other) servient estate, 
designated as Lot No. 21559-B and owned by the Spouses Arce, the 
appellate court concluded that there is no need to establish an easement
 over respondentâs property. The CA explained that, while the 
alternative route through the property of the Spouses Arce is longer and
 circuitous, said access road is adequate. It emphasized that the 
convenience of the dominant estate is never the gauge for the grant of 
compulsory right of way. Thus, the opening of another passageway is 
unjustified.
[13]




Aggrieved, petitioners come before this Court, raising the following issues:







I.


CAN PETITIONERS BE ENTITLED TO A GRANT OF A LEGAL
 EASEMENT OF RIGHT OF WAY FROM THEIR LANDLOCKED PROPERTY THROUGH THE 
PROPERTY OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT WHICH IS THE SHORTEST ROUTE IN GOING TO 
AND FROM THEIR PROPERTY TO THE PUBLIC STREET AND WHERE THEY USED TO 
PASS? 




II.


CAN RESPONDENT REFUSE TO GRANT A RIGHT OF WAY ON 
THE DESIRED PASSAGEWAY WHICH HE CLOSED SINCE THERE IS ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY
 WHICH IS MORE CIRCUITOUS AND BURDENSOME AND IS BELATEDLY OFFERED UNTO 
PETITIONERS? 


III.


CAN PETITIONERS BE COMPELLED TO AVAIL OF A LEGAL 
EASEMENT OF RIGHT OF WAY THROUGH THE PROPERTY OF ARCE WHICH WAS 
BELATEDLY OFFERED BUT HAS BEEN FORECLOSED BY THE BANK AND WHEREIN THE 
LATTER IS NOT A PARTY TO THE CASE?
[14]
 




The petition is without merit.


 It is already a well-settled rule that the jurisdiction of this 
Court in cases brought before it from the CA by virtue of Rule 45 of the
 Rules of Court is limited to reviewing errors of law. Findings of fact 
of the CA are conclusive upon this Court. There are, however, recognized
 exceptions to the foregoing rule, namely: 




(1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures;


(2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible;


(3) when there is grave abuse of discretion;


(4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;


 (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting;


 (6) when, in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went 
beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the 
admissions of both the appellant and the appellee;


 (7) when the findings are contrary to those of the trial court;


 (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;


(9) when the facts set forth in the petition, as well as in the 
petitioner's main and reply briefs, are not disputed by the respondent; 
and


(10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record.
[15]
 




The present case falls under the 7th exception, as the RTC and the CA 
arrived at conflicting findings of fact and conclusions of law.

The conferment of a legal easement of right of way is governed by 
Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code, quoted below for easy reference:
[16]




Article 649.  The owner, or any person who by virtue of a real 
right may cultivate or use any immovable, which is surrounded by other 
immovables pertaining to other persons and without adequate outlet to a 
public highway, is entitled to demand a right of way through the 
neighboring estates, after payment of the proper indemnity.


Should this easement be established in such a manner that its use 
may be continuous for all the needs of the dominant estate, establishing
 a permanent passage, the indemnity shall consist of the value of the 
land occupied and the amount of the damage caused to the servient 
estate.


In case the right of way is limited to the necessary passage for 
the cultivation of the estate surrounded by others and for the gathering
 of its crops through the servient estate without a permanent way, the 
indemnity shall consist in the payment of the damage caused by such 
encumbrance.
      
This easement is not compulsory if the isolation of the immovable is due
 to the proprietorâs own acts.


Article 650. The easement of right of way shall be established at 
the point least prejudicial to the servient estate, and, insofar as 
consistent with this rule, where the distance from the dominant estate 
to a public highway may be the shortest. 




To be entitled to an easement of right of way, the following requisites should be met:




1.The dominant estate is surrounded by other immovables and has no adequate outlet to a public highway;


2.There is payment of proper indemnity;


3.The isolation is not due to the acts of the proprietor of the dominant estate; and


4.The right of way claimed is at the point least prejudicial to the
 servient estate; and insofar as consistent with this rule, where the 
distance from the dominant estate to a public highway may be the 
shortest.
[17]




Petitioners may be correct in the theoretical reading of Articles 649
 and 650 of the Civil Code, but they nevertheless failed to show 
sufficient factual evidence to satisfy the above-enumerated 
requirements.
[18]




It must be stressed that, by its very nature, and when considered  
with reference to the obligations imposed on the servient estate, an 
easement involves an abnormal restriction on the property rights of the 
servient owner and is regarded as a charge or encumbrance on the 
servient estate. It is incumbent upon the owner of the dominant estate 
to establish by clear and convincing evidence the presence of all the 
preconditions before his claim for easement of right of way may be 
granted.
[19]
 Petitioners failed in this regard.
    



Admittedly, petitioners had been granted a right of way through the 
other adjacent lot owned by the Spouses Arce. In fact, other lot owners 
use the said outlet in going to and coming from the public highway. 
Clearly, there is an existing outlet to and from the public road.


 However, petitioners claim that the outlet is longer and circuitous,
 and they have to pass through other lots owned by different owners 
before they could get to the highway. We find petitionersâ concept of 
what is "adequate outlet" a complete disregard of the well-entrenched 
doctrine that in order to justify the imposition of an easement of right
 of way, there must be real, not fictitious or artificial, necessity for
 it. Mere convenience for the dominant estate is not what is required by
 law as the basis of setting up a compulsory easement. Even in the face 
of necessity, if it can be satisfied without imposing the easement, the 
same should not be imposed.
[20]






We quote with approval the CAâs observations in this wise:


 As it shows, [petitioners] had been granted a right of way through
 the adjacent estate of Spouses Arce before the complaint below was even
 filed. [Respondent] alleged that this right of way is being used by the
 other estates which are similarly situated as [petitioners]. 
[Petitioners] do not dispute this fact. There is also a reason to 
believe that this right of way is Spouses Arceâs outlet to a public road
 since their property, as it appears from the Sketch Map, is also 
surrounded by other estates. The fact that Spouses Arce are not 
insisting on a right of way through respondentâs property, although an 
opening on the latterâs property is undoubtedly the most direct and 
shortest distance to P. Gomez St. from the formerâs property, bolsters 
our conviction that they have adequate outlet to the highway which they 
are now likewise making available to [petitioners].
[21]
 




The convenience of the dominant estate has never been the gauge for 
the grant of compulsory right of way. To be sure, the true standard for 
the grant of the legal right is "adequacy." Hence, when there is already
 an existing adequate outlet from the dominant estate to a public 
highway, as in this case, even when the said outlet, for one reason or 
another, be inconvenient, the need to open up another servitude is 
entirely unjustified.
[22]




Thus, in 
Cristobal v. CA,
[23]

 the Court disallowed the easement prayed for because an outlet already 
exists which is a path walk located at the left side of petitionersâ 
property and which is connected to a private road about five hundred 
(500) meters long. The private road, in turn, leads to Ma. Elena Street,
 which is about 2.5 meters wide, and finally, to Visayas Avenue. This 
outlet was determined by the Court to be sufficient for the needs of the
 dominant estate.
    



Also in 
Floro v. Llenado,
[24]

 we refused to impose a right of way over petitionerâs property although
 private respondentâs alternative route was admittedly inconvenient 
because he had to traverse several ricelands and rice paddies belonging 
to different persons, not to mention that said passage is impassable 
during the rainy season.


And in 
Ramos, Sr. v. Gatchalian Realty, Inc.,
[25]
 this
 Court refused to grant the easement prayed for even if petitioner had 
to pass through lots belonging to other owners, as temporary ingress and
 egress, which lots were grassy, cogonal, and greatly inconvenient due 
to flood and mud because such grant would run counter to the prevailing 
jurisprudence that mere convenience for the dominant estate does not 
suffice to serve as basis for the easement.
[26]
 


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the petition is 
DENIED.
 The Court of Appeals Decision dated January 31, 2007 and Resolution dated October 23, 2007 in CA-G.R. CV No. 85471 are 
AFFIRMED.
