SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 186243, April 11, 2011 ]


HACIENDA PRIMERA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION and ANNA KATRINA E. HERNANDEZ, Petitioners, vs. MICHAEL S. VILLEGAS, Respondent.
RESOLUTION




NACHURA, J.:


This is a petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision
[1]
 dated November 27, 2008 and Resolution
[2]

 dated February 3, 2009 in CA-G.R. SP No. 104847.

The facts of the case are as follows:

Petitioner Hacienda Primera Development Corporation (petitioner 
Hacienda) hired respondent Michael S. Villegas as General Manager of 
Amorita Resort. He was hired as a probationary employee for three (3) 
months. The employment contract contained the following terms and 
conditions:


Salary of P60,000.00 net per month for the first three (3) months and upon his regularization, P70,000.00 net per month.


Six (6) round trip tickets (TAG-MLA-TAG) per annum.


P2,500.00 cell phone bill allowance.


Fifteen (15) days vacation leave and fifteen (15) days sick leave upon permanency.


Pro-rated 13th month pay starting December 2006.


A 3-month probationary period starting January 200
[7]
.


Board and lodging in the resort.


Medical Insurance.
[3]


Respondent started working for petitioner on January 1, 2007. On March 
14, 2007, he received a call from Paramount Consultancy and Management 
telling him to report back to Manila. There, he learned that his 
services were terminated. He, thus, asked for a written notice of 
termination, but did not receive any.
[4]

 Hence, the complaint for illegal dismissal.

Petitioner Hacienda, on the other hand, stated that respondent was hired
 as probationary employee. It explained that respondentâs services were 
terminated because he failed to qualify for regular employment. 
Specifically, it claimed that respondent failed to conceptualize and 
complete financial budgets, sales projection, room rates, website 
development, and marketing plan in coordination with the Sales and 
Marketing Manager.
[5]


On November 22, 2007, Labor Arbiter (LA) Herminio V. Suelo rendered a decision
[6]
 in favor of respondent, the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding complainant illegally dismissed.

Accordingly, respondents are hereby ordered as follows:


To reinstate complainant to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other benefits;


To pay complainant his backwages from the time he was dismissed
 on March 15, 2007, until his actual reinstatement either physically or 
by payroll;


To pay complainant moral damages in the amount of Fifty 
Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), and exemplary damages also in the amount of
 Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00);


To pay complainant attorneyâs fees equivalent to ten (10) percent of the total monetary award.


The reinstatement aspect of this Decision is immediately executory 
pursuant to Article 223 of the Labor Code, as amended. Respondents are 
therefore directed to submit a report of compliance thereof before this 
Office within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of this Decision.

The Fiscal Examiner or the computation and examination unit of this 
Office is directed to compute the monetary aspect of the above-judgment 
awards which shall form part of this Decision.

SO ORDERED.
[7]


Aggrieved, petitioner Hacienda elevated the case to the National Labor 
Relations Commission (NLRC), which partially granted8 the appeal, worded
 in this wise:


WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the instant appeal is
 PARTIALLY GRANTED.
 The charge of illegal dismissal is 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit.

Accordingly, the Decision is 
MODIFIED
 to order the 
respondents-appellants to pay his salary corresponding to the unexpired 
portion of his contract of employment (March 16-31, 2007) in the amount 
of P30,000.00.

SO ORDERED.
[9]
 


In a Decision
[10]
 dated 
November 27, 2008, the CA set aside the above NLRC decision and 
reinstated that of the LA. The dispositive portion of the assailed CA 
Decision is quoted below for easy reference:


WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is hereby GRANTED. The 
Decision of the NLRC is hereby SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the Decision of 
the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED with the MODIFICATION that since 
reinstatement is no longer possible due to strained relations between 
the parties, a separation pay of one month for every year of service is 
hereby decreed. In this connection, the instant case is hereby remanded 
to the Labor Arbiter for the computation of the said monetary award.

SO ORDERED.
[11]


Petitioner Haciendaâs motion for reconsideration was denied in a 
Resolution12 dated February 3, 2009.  Hence, the instant petition with 
the following assigned errors:


(A) THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF JUDGMENT WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT WAS ILLEGALLY DISMISSED;


(B) THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF JUDGMENT IN 
REINSTATING THE DECISION OF THE LABOR ARBITER AWARDING UNLIMITED 
BACKWAGES BEYOND THE RESPONDENTâS PROBATIONARY EMPLOYMENT;


(C) THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF JUDGMENT WHEN IT 
RULED THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES;


(D) THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF JUDGMENT WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYâS FEES;


(E) THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF JUDGMENT WHEN IT ORDERED THE PAYMENT OF SEPARATION PAY; AND


(F) THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR OF JUDGMENT WHEN IT 
DECIDED THE PETITION OF RESPONDENT ALTHOUGH THE NLRCâS RSOLUTION DATED 
22 APRIL 2008 IS ALREADY FINAL AND EXECUTORY SINCE RESPONDENTâS MOTION 
FOR RECONSIDERATION, CONTRARY TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE NLRC, IS 
UNVERIFIED.
[13]


The petition is unmeritorious.

The Labor Code and its Implementing Rules govern probationary employment.14


LABOR CODE



Art. 281. 
Probationary Employment.
âProbationary employment shall 
not exceed six (6) months from the date the employee started working, 
unless it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer
 period.  The services of an employee who has been engaged on a 
probationary basis may be terminated for a just cause or when he fails 
to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards
 made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his 
engagement. An employee who is allowed to work after a probationary 
period shall be considered a regular employee.





LABOR CODE, Implementing Rules of Book VI,  Rule I, Section 6



Sec. 6. 
Probationary employment.
 There is probationary employment
 where the employee, upon his engagement, is made to undergo a trial 
period during which the employer determines his fitness to qualify for 
regular employment, based on reasonable standards made known to him at 
the time of engagement.


Probationary employment shall be governed by the following rules:


x x x x


(c) The services of an employee who has been engaged on probationary 
basis may be terminated only for a just or authorized cause, when he 
fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with the reasonable
 standards prescribed by the employer.


(d) In all cases of probationary employment, the employer shall make 
known to the employee the standards under which he will qualify as a 
regular employee at the time of his engagement. Where no standards are 
made known to the employee at that time, he shall be deemed a regular 
employee.


In Magis Young Achieversâ Learning Center v. Manalo,15 the Court described probationary employment in this wise:


A probationary employee or probationer is one who is on 
trial for an employer, during which the latter determines whether or not
 he is qualified for permanent employment. The probationary employment 
is intended to afford the employer an opportunity to observe the fitness
 of a probationary employee while at work, and to ascertain whether he 
will become an efficient and productive employee. While the employer 
observes the fitness, propriety and efficiency of a probationer to 
ascertain whether he is qualified for permanent employment, the 
probationer, on the other hand, seeks to prove to the employer that he 
has the qualifications to meet the reasonable standards for permanent 
employment. Thus, the word probationary, as used to describe the period 
of employment, implies the purpose of the term or period, not its 
length.
[16]


It can be gleaned from the foregoing provisions of law and 
jurisprudential pronouncement that there are two grounds to legally 
terminate a probationary employee. It may be done either:  a) for a just
 cause; or b)  when the employee fails to qualify as a regular employee 
in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to 
the employee at the start of the employment.
[17]



In this case, petitioner Hacienda fails to specify the reasonable 
standards by which respondentâs alleged poor performance was evaluated, 
much less to prove that such standards were made known to him at the 
start of his employment.
[18]
 Thus, he is deemed to have been hired from day one as a regular employee.
[19]

 Due process dictates that an employee be apprised beforehand of the 
condition of his employment and of the terms of advancement therein.
[20]



We quote with approval the CAâs observation in this wise:


Verily, a cursory examination of the employment contract 
readily shows the absence of any standard to which [respondent] should 
comply. Neither was there any indicia that [respondent] was ever 
informed of the said standards if there [were] any. What [petitioners] 
merely claim, as mentioned above, is that [respondent] was presumed to 
know the standard required of him as General Manager in charge [of] the 
pre-opening of the resort.[21 ]



In 
Secon Philippines, Ltd. v. NLRC,22 Orient Express Placement Phils. v. NLRC,23 
and 
Davao Contractors Development Cooperative (DACODECO) v. Pasawa,
[24]

 we did not sustain the employeesâ dismissal for failure of the employer
 to apprise them of the reasonable standards they needed to comply with 
for their continued employment.


We find no reason to depart from the above conclusion.





WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The Court of 
Appeals Decision dated November 27, 2008 and Resolution dated February 
3, 2009 in CA-G.R. SP No. 104847 are AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
