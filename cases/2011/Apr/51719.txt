SUNRISE HOLIDAY CONCEPTS, INC., Petitioner, vs. TERESA A. ARUGAY, Respondent.
D E C I S I O N




NACHURA, J.:


Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari, assailing the Amended Decision
[1]
 dated April 7, 2009 and the Resolution
[2]
  dated September 2, 2009 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 100227. 


The Facts


Version of the Employee


On February 16, 2004, respondent was engaged by petitioner as 
Collection Manager under a six (6)-month probationary period. She was 
promised a compensation of Sixteen Thousand Pesos (P16,000.00) plus Two 
Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00), which shall be adjusted to Twenty-Five 
Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) at the end of the 6-month probationary 
period. After six (6) months, respondent continued to work for 
petitioner company but it made no salary adjustment.
[3]
 


As part of her functions, respondent coordinated largely with her 
four (4) collectors and with clients, numbering more than two thousand 
(2,000), from whom she was collecting existing accounts for petitioner 
company. In the exercise of her functions, respondent made use of the 
companyâs old mobile phone. Extensive coordination with company 
employees and with clients compelled respondent to bring the cellular 
phone out of the company premises.  No one told respondent that she had 
to get permission from higher management to bring out the said cellular 
phone. Respondentâs job as a Collection Manager required her to be 
persistent with those whom she dealt with to collect badly needed funds 
for the company.
[4]
 


In the course of her functions, respondent sent a memorandum chiding 
her Assistant Collection Manager for the latterâs lack of dedication and
 her act of cheating on her timecard. Unfortunately, the Assistant 
Collection Manager made an issue out of this and complained to the 
Executive Assistant of petitioner company. The Executive Assistant 
favored the Assistant Collection Manager, who is his goddaughter, and 
ignored respondentâs report.
[5]
 


On September 20, 2004, respondent received a show-cause Memorandum 
for:  â(A)	Act of Dishonestyâunauthorized bringing into or taking out 
any article from company premises. From April 2004 to present, you have 
been bringing home the Companyâs mobile phone during weekends without 
prior approval and consent from higher authority/ies and allegedly using
 the same for your personal use; (B) Tardiness. For incurring excessive 
and habitual tardiness of more than five (5) times in a month without 
just and valid reasons.â
[6]
 


Respondent was stunned by such charges because, as early as March 
2004, she had already expressed the urgent need of a cellular phone in 
the operation of her department. In April 2004, respondent even 
submitted to petitioner a formal request or requisition for a mobile 
phone for each collector, as well as a unit for herself, as Collection 
Manager. The request for a cellular phone for herself was specified to 
cover her personal calls, on the understanding that the Collection 
Department would be able to increase its output or collections. No 
objection was expressed by petitioner to such request. Respondent 
rendered uncompensated overtime on weekdays, and reported for work on 
Saturdays and even on holidays, believing that her dedication, 
discipline, and hard work would be valued by petitioner. Respondent was 
hurt when she, a manager of petitioner company, was charged for minutes 
of tardiness, when she had rendered much more to the company.
[7]
 


On September 21, 2004, respondent submitted her written explanation 
intensely denying the charges imputed to her. She requested for a formal
 confrontation with her accusers in order to address the issues against 
her. To her surprise, the Executive Assistant of petitioner company 
denied her request for a confrontation, while she was preventively 
suspended to make way for an administrative investigation.
[8]
 


On September 28, 2004, respondent received a termination letter for 
alleged loss of trust and confidence, which termination was immediately 
effective.
[9]
 The pertinent portion of the termination letter reads: â
[T]
he
 Management has found that you have patently violated our company rules 
and regulations with the unlawful use of company property, poor 
management style, misdemeanor and conduct unbecoming of an officer of 
the company.â
[10]
 


Thus, respondent filed a case for illegal dismissal, nonpayment of 
13th month pay, payment of damages and attorneyâs fees against 
petitioner before the Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations
 Commission (NLRC).
[11]
 


Version of the Employer


Respondent was hired as a probationary employee with the position of 
Collection Manager on February 16, 2004. She had a basic monthly salary 
of P16,000.00, with an allowance of P2,000.
[12]
 


Prior to her engagement, respondent was duly apprised of her duties 
and responsibilities, pertinent company standards, company policies, 
rules, and regulations. Among such policies made known to respondent was
 the prohibition on the bringing home company properties and using the 
same for personal purposes.  One such property was the cellular phone 
issued to respondent.
[13]
 


According to petitioner:


As Collection Manager, respondent habitually exercised discretion and
 independent judgment in the supervision and control of company 
resources and properties assigned to her department, subject to existing
 company policies, rules, and regulations.  She was charged with the 
care and safekeeping of these properties.
[14]
 


Respondent was tasked to exercise discretion and independent judgment
 in areas involving the formulation of effective programs and measures 
to enhance the companyâs collection of its receivables and to ensure 
that these receivables were all safely kept, accounted and properly 
endorsed to the proper company official. The said cellular phone was 
issued to respondent for her to use within the company premises and 
strictly for official purposes only.
[15]
 


However, respondent, in deliberate disregard of and disobedience to 
company policy, repeatedly and habitually brought home the cellular 
phone issued to her by the company.  She made several personal calls on 
said cellular phone during Saturdays and Sundays, which calls were paid 
for by the company to the latterâs damage and prejudice. Moreover, 
respondent, with abuse of her rank and influence in several instances, 
borrowed money from her subordinates for personal purposes. Respondent 
engaged in rumormongering involving her subordinates, sowing intrigues 
and discord among her subordinates. Respondent also incurred more than 
five (5) tardiness each month for several months, which were contrary to
 the company policies, rules, and regulations. These prompted the 
company to formally ask respondent to explain her dishonesty, serious 
misconduct, and other violations in a Memorandum dated September 20, 
2004.
[16]
 


On September 21, 2004, respondent submitted her written explanation. 
 She failed to satisfactorily explain her unauthorized use of the 
companyâs cellular phone even outside the office premises, including the
 charging of her personal calls.  Respondent admitted her habitual 
tardiness, alleging that âthe hours lost due to my tardiness are over 
compensated.â
[17]
 


On September 28, 2004, petitioner formally terminated respondentâs employment.
[18]


On May 28, 2005, the Labor Arbiter (LA) rendered a decision
[19]
  in favor of respondent, the dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby 
rendered finding the dismissal of complainant to be illegal.  
Accordingly, respondents are ordered jointly and severally:


	To reinstate complainant to her former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges;


	To pay complainant full backwages from time of dismissal which up to date amounts to P225,000.00 up to actual reinstatement;


	To pay complainant moral damages in the amount of P20,000.00; 


	To pay complainant exemplary damages in the amount of P20,000.00; and


	To pay complainant attorneyâs fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total award.


All other claims are denied.


SO ORDERED.


On appeal, the NLRC affirmed in to the decision of the LA in a decision
[20]
  dated November 17, 2006. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration. However, the NLRC denied the same in a resolution
[21]
 dated June 18, 2007. 


Undaunted, petitioner elevated the case to the CA. On June 26, 2008, the CA rendered a Decision
[22]
  reversing the decision of the NLRC. The fallo of the Decision reads:


WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the assailed issuances of the NLRC dated November 17, 2006, and June 18, 2007, are hereby 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.  Petitioner is 
ORDERED
 to pay the private respondent the amount of P30,000.00 as nominal damages for non-compliance with statutory due process.


SO ORDERED.
[23]
 


Aggrieved, respondent filed a motion for reconsideration. On April 7, 2009, the CA rendered an Amended Decision
[24]

  reinstating the decision and the resolution of the NLRC with 
modification, the dispositive portion of the said Amended Decision 
reads: 


WHEREFORE
, the Motion for Reconsideration is 
GRANTED
.  The assailed Decision dated June 26, 2008 of this Court is 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.  The NLRC decision dated November 17, 2006 and resolution dated June 18, 2007, affirming the Labor Arbiterâs decision, are 
REINSTATED
 with the 
MODIFICATION

 that should private respondent Teresa Arugay opt not to be reinstated, 
petitioner is ordered to pay her separation pay in the amount equivalent
 to one (1) month pay for every year of service, plus backwages from the
 date of her termination, minus Nine (9.00) pesos representing the 
amount for the three personal calls made by private respondent.  The 
award for moral and exemplary damages and all other money claims, are 
DELETED
 for lack of sufficient basis.


SO ORDERED.
[25]
 


Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, however, the CA denied the same in a Resolution dated September 2, 2009.


Hence, this petition. 


The Issue


Whether respondent was illegally dismissed from employment by petitioner company. 


The Ruling of the Court


In an illegal dismissal case, the onus probandi rests on the employer
 to prove that its dismissal of an employee is for a valid cause.
[26]

   Petitioner dismissed respondent from employment because of alleged 
loss of trust and confidence due to tardiness and for using the company 
issued cellular phone outside the company premises and for her own 
personal use. 


Loss of trust and confidence to be a valid ground for dismissal must 
be based on a willful breach of trust and founded on clearly established
 facts.  A breach is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly, and
 purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act 
done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly, or inadvertently.  Otherwise
 stated, it must rest on substantial grounds and not on the employer's 
arbitrariness, whims, caprices, or suspicion; otherwise, the employee 
would eternally remain at the mercy of the employer.  It should be 
genuine and not simulated; nor should it appear as a mere afterthought 
to justify an earlier action taken in bad faith or a subterfuge for 
causes that are improper, illegal, or unjustified.  It has never been 
intended to afford an occasion for abuse because of its subjective 
nature. There must, therefore, be an actual breach of duty committed by 
the employee that must be established by substantial evidence.
[27]
 


In this case, petitioner failed to prove that respondentâs dismissal 
was for a valid cause. The CA committed no reversible error in issuing 
the Amended Decision upholding the illegal dismissal of respondent. The 
penalty of dismissal is not commensurate to the infraction committed by 
the employee. Based on the findings of fact by the LA, which were 
affirmed by the NLRC and the CA, respondent made only three (3) personal
 calls using the company - issued cellular phone, and the total cost of 
the said calls was Nine Pesos (P9.00). Respondent herself duly recorded 
the said personal calls on the company logbook so that the same could be
 charged to her personal account, which disproves the imputation of her 
dishonesty.   On the alleged tardiness committed by respondent, the same
 is not grave as to merit respondentâs dismissal from service, 
considering that if it was true that respondent had been habitually 
tardy for several months, petitioner would not have retained her 
services beyond the probationary period. The LA amply explained the 
unjustifiable dismissal of respondent in this wise, viz.: 


This Office does not subscribe to the idea that 
complainant who is a manager should be dismissed for making three 
personal mobile phone calls worth P9.00, or for being late a number of 
times.  Nor does this Office believe that complainantâs act of taking 
outside of company premises a mobile phone in the pursuit of her office 
functions is an act of dishonesty.  Complainant stated that she declared
 the three calls worth P9.00 in the company logbook before making the 
calls so that they can be charged to her personal account; That she was 
not aware of any existing company policy prohibiting the taking out of 
company premises the cellular phone (Annex â10â); That she was not 
furnished with a copy of the companyâs written policies (Code of Good 
Behavior) despite her repeated requests; That prior to accusations being
 made against her, she expressed the need for, and formalized a request 
for the requisition of cellular phones for each collector in the company
 and one for herself for official use as well as for personal calls, and
 management did not object; That she had rendered much overtime, 
including work on her rest day and holidays; and that the companyâs 
Executive Assistant expressed his high regard of complainantâs 
performance before accusations were made against her.  Respondents 
failed to controvert these allegations, and they are therefore deemed 
admitted.  The records confirm that there is no proof that a copy of 
respondentsâ company policies (Annex âAâ of respondentsâ reply) was 
furnished to complainant prior to the alleged violations.


Respondents stated that complainant was âa grossly dishonest 
managerial employee and the epitome of what is classically called a âbad
 exampleââ¦â If this was true, respondents could have easily dismissed 
complainant during the probationary period that ended a month before 
complainant was dismissed.  But respondents did not.


Finally, a lesser penalty should have been imposed by petitioner 
company to respondent considering that she has no history of previous 
infractions. The penalty of dismissal is not commensurate to the 
violation committed by her. It bears stressing that while an employer 
enjoys a wide latitude of discretion in the promulgation of policies, 
rules, and regulations on work-related activities of the employees, 
those directives, however, must always be fair and reasonable, and the 
corresponding penalties, when prescribed, must always be commensurate to
 the offense involved and to the degree of the infraction.
