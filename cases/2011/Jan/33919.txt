[ G.R. No. 183843, January 19, 2011 ]

CARPIO MORALES, J.:


In June 1991, Golden Arches Development Corporation (petitioner) entered into a lease contract over a property owned by Prince City Realty, Inc. located at the corner of Julia Vargas Avenue and Bank Drive, Ortigas Center, Mandaluyong City.
The lease contract commenced on June 27, 1991 and was to terminate on February 27, 2008.Â  On November 2, 2006, however, petitioner informed St. Francis Square Holdings, Inc. (respondent), successor-in-interest of ASB Holdings, Inc. by which Prince Realty, Inc. eventually became known, of its intention to discontinue the lease.
Amicable negotiations between the parties having failed, respondent filed on May 4, 2007 an action for breach of contract and damages against petitioner before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mandaluyong.

Sec. 2. 
Venue of personal actions

where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiff resides
, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendant resides, or in the case of a non-resident defendant where he may be found, at the election of the plaintiff.Â  (underscoring supplied)
Opposing the Motion to Dismiss, respondent claimed that it had closed down its office in Makati effective December 31, 2005 as it now holds office in Mandaluyong City of which petitioner is aware.
By Order of August 21, 2007,
[2]
 Branch 212 of the Mandaluyong RTC denied the motion to dismiss in this wise:
. . .Â  [P]laintiff's[-herein respondent's] Articles of Incorporation having stated [that] its principal office is located in Metro Manila, this Court is of the opinion that venue was properly laid considering that the instant case was filed in Mandaluyong Cty which is part or a place within Metro Manila.
Basic is the rule regarding propriety of venue in actions involving private juridical entities that the principal place of business of a corporation determines its residence or domicile such that the place indicated in petitioner's Articl
