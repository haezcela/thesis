THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. NO. 159750, December 14, 2005 ]


JEHAN SHIPPING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The general rule is that the three-day notice requirement in motions under Sections 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court is mandatory. It is an integral component of procedural due process. But when the adverse party has actually had the opportunity to be heard, and has indeed been heard through pleadings filed in opposition to the motion, the purpose behind the rule is deemed duly served. The requirements of due process are substantially complied with.
The Case
Before us is a Petition for Review,
[1]
 filed by Jehan Shipping Corporation under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The Petition seeks to reverse and set aside the January 31, 2003 Decision
[2]
 and the September 9, 2003 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 69209. The assailed CA Decision disposed as follows:
"WHEREFORE
, in the light of the foregoing, the Petition is hereby GRANTED. The questioned Joint Resolution dated 08 January 2002, the Writ of Execution dated 16 January 2002, and the Order dated 25 January 2002 are hereby SET ASIDE. Public respondent is ordered to rule on the substantive merits of petitioner [herein respondent] NFA's Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion For Reconsideration and, thereafter, to proceed in accordance with the rules of procedure. The injunction prayed for is hereby GRANTED and made permanent."
[4]
The CA denied reconsideration in its September 9, 2003 Resolution.
The Facts
The relevant procedural and factual antecedents of this case are summarized in the challenged Decision, as follows:
"On 02 August 1997, [petitioner] Jehan Shipping Corporation (
Jehan
, for short) filed a complaint against NFA [National Food Authority] before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 5 for collection of a sum of money with a prayer for injunction. The complaint alleged, among others, that NFA failed and refused to pay the sum of One Hundred Thirty Nine Thousand and Thirty Pesos (P139,030.00) representing earned freight for the services of 
Jehan's
 vessel, the M/V Phannie, which NFA hired on 30 April 1996 to transport NFA's nineteen thousand three hundred (19,300) bags of imported rice from the M/V Altabith berthed at the Cebu anchorage area to the pier of Cebu City. The complaint further alleged that the M/V Phannie capsized and sank on 01 May 1996 due to big waves generated by fast crafts for which reason, thus, 
Jehan
 incurred expenses in salvaging and subsequently rehabilitating the vessel in the amount of Thirteen Million Six Hundred Twelve Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty Seven Pesos and Forty Seven Centavos (P13,612,767.47); and that the sinking of the vessel was due to NFA's fault and negligence as an 
NFA
 representative who was on the vessel did not allow it to leave because there was no berthing space at the pier though the vessel would have immediately left after the bags of rice were unloaded on it. On 18 September 1997, 
NFA
 filed its Answer with Counterclaims which specifically denied 
Jehan's
 allegations, and alleged that 
Jehan
 had no cause of action; that the proximate cause of the sinking of the M/V Phannie was the fault, negligence, and lack of care and foresight of the vessel's crew which was under the employ of 
Jehan
; that 
Jehan
 was grossly negligent in the performance of its duties in the loading of the bags of rice; that the vessel's sinking was entirely due to its unseaworthiness; and that the 
NFA
 was not liable for the salvaging and rehabilitation of the vessel as it was not the vessel's owner. 
NFA
 alleged in its counterclaim that it incurred losses equivalent to the value of the 19,300 bags of rice, and that it incurred transportation expenses, expenses to contract the services of a legal counsel, and other expenses x x x.
"On 28 August 2001, a Decision was rendered which ordered 
NFA
, among others, to pay 
Jehan
 the amounts the latter claimed as earned freight for the services of, and as expenses in salvaging and rehabilitating, the M/V Phannie as well as interest therefor; and attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and the cost of the suit x x x.

[5]
Respondent National Food Authority (NFA) assailed before the Court of Appeals, via a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Application for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order, the trial court's January 8, 2002 Joint Resolution, January 16, 2002 Writ of Execution, and January 25, 2002 Order.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
The CA found that, despite lack of notice of the date and time of hearing, Jehan's counsel -- in his Oppositions -- was able to refute the substantial issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration and the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration filed by the NFA. Moreover, he was present during the hearing of the Motions. Hence, the CA concluded that the requirement of the Rules on notice of hearing in motions had sufficiently been met, and the trial court erred in denying the Motions and in declaring them 
pro forma.
 Consequently, it held that NFA's period to appeal had not yet lapsed.
Furthermore, the appellate court held that there was a denial of due process when the trial court ruled upon Jehan's Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Execution even before NFA had the opportunity to file a comment within the period given.
Hence, this Petition.
[6]
Issue
In its Memorandum, petitioner submits this lone issue for our consideration:
"Whether or not the Court of Appeals may still disturb, much less review and set aside on certiorari under Rule 65, a Writ of Execution issued by the trial court to implement its Decision which is already final and executory by operation of law."
[7]
Stated otherwise, the issue for our resolution is whether the CA committed a reversible error of law in granting the writ of certiorari. Corollary to this question is whether the lack of notice of hearing in the Motion for Reconsideration is fatal, such that the filing of the Motion did not toll the period to appeal, and the August 28, 2001 RTC Decision consequently became final and executory.
The Court's Ruling
The Petition is devoid of merit.
Main Issue:
Lack of Notice of Hearing
in a Motion for Reconsideration
Admittedly, respondent committed a procedural lapse in failing to include a notice of hearing in its Motion for Reconsideration,
[8]
 filed on the very last day of its appeal period or on October 16, 2001. Again, it committed the same lapse in its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration,
[9]
 which it filed on November 12, 2001.
[10]
 It postulates, though, that the procedural lapse should not defeat its Motions for the following reasons: (1) petitioner was able to oppose squarely the issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondent; and, (2) in deciding against the latter, the trial court manifestly committed a grave error, which resulted in huge losses for the government. Respondent adds that the procedural rule, which is intended to secure substantial justice, may be relaxed when its rigid application would defeat the ends of justice.
Citing various decisions of this Court, however, petitioner avers that, because of the failure of respondent to include a notice of hearing, the latter's Motions are worthless pieces of paper with no legal effect.
Purpose Behind the
Notice Requirement
This Court has indeed held time and time again that, under Sections 4
[11]
 and 5
[12]
 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, mandatory is the notice requirement in a motion, which is rendered defective by failure to comply with the requirement.
[13]
 As a rule, a motion without a notice of hearing is considered 
pro forma
 and does not affect the reglementary period for the appeal or the filing of the requisite pleading.
[14]
As an integral component of procedural due process, the three-day notice required by the Rules is not intended for the benefit of the movant. Rather, the requirement is for the purpose of avoiding surprises that may be sprung upon the adverse party, who must be given time to study and meet the arguments in the motion before a resolution by the court.
[15]
 Principles of natural justice demand that the right of a party should not be affected without giving it an opportunity to be heard.
[16]
The test is the presence of the opportunity to be heard, as well as to have time to study the motion and meaningfully oppose or controvert the grounds upon which it is based. Considering the circumstances of the present case, we believe that the requirements of procedural due process were substantially complied with, and that the compliance justified a departure from a literal application of the rule on notice of hearing.
[17]
Petitioner's Opportunity
To Be Heard
A close perusal of the records reveals that the trial court gave petitioner ten days within which to comment on respondent's Motion for Reconsideration. Petitioner filed its Opposition to the Motion on November 26, 2001. In its 14-page Opposition,
[18]
 it not only pointed out that the Motion was defective for not containing a notice of hearing and should then be dismissed outright by the court; it also ventilated its substantial arguments against the merits of the Motion and of the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration. Notably, its arguments
[19]
 were recited at length in the trial court's January 8, 2002 Joint Resolution. Nevertheless, the court proceeded to deny the Motions on the sole ground that they did not contain any notice of hearing.
The requirement of notice of time and hearing in the pleading filed by a party is necessary only to apprise the other of the actions of the former.
[20]
 Under the circumstances of the present case, the purpose of a notice of hearing was served.
Equally important is the fact that the trial court set the Motion for Reconsideration and the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration for hearing on December 7, 2001, during which petitioner's counsel appeared.
[21]
 In other cases,
[22]
 the Court has held that lack of notice is cured when, after learning that a motion has that defect, the trial court promptly resets a hearing with due notice to all the parties. Hence, we find no reversible error committed by the CA in ruling that the Motion for Reconsideration was not 
pro forma
 and in setting aside the subject Orders of the trial court.
Counsel's Duty
Indeed, in this particular case, the purpose of the notice requirement in motions has been duly served. But even as we rule in this manner, we emphasize that NFA's lawyer was supposed to be inbued with a knowledge of rules and procedures, especially elementary ones like those involved in this case. The counsel was duty-bound to observe and abide by those rules and procedures, which were designed primarily to ensure the orderly administration of justice. Unnecessary delays can be avoided when lawyers are diligent and faithful in performing their duties.
Additional Arguments
of the Parties
In addition to its arguments on the main issue, petitioner avers that the RTC was nonetheless correct in finding that the sinking of 
M/V Phannie
 was attributable to respondent, which should therefore be made liable for the resulting damages. Respondent contends, though, that the trial court (1) should have applied the setoff or compensation principle in the instant case; and (2) should not have relied merely upon the findings and recommendations of the Special Board of Marine Inquiry (SBMI) for holding the NFA liable for the sinking of 
M/V Phannie.
The above arguments, however, refer to the merits of the August 28, 2001 RTC Decision. They had not been raised in the Petition before the CA and were consequently not taken up in its assailed Decision. Neither have they been included as issues in the Petition before us. In fact, the arguments of respondent are the very grounds for its Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration before the trial court. Hence, we deem it improper to resolve them at this time.
WHEREFORE, the Petition is 
DENIED
 and the assailed Decision 
AFFIRMED.
