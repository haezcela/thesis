OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN AND DENNIS M. VILLA-IGNACIO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, PETITIONERS, VS. ATTY. GIL A. VALERA AND COURT OF APPEALS (SPECIAL FIRST DIVISION), RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




CALLEJO, SR., J.:


Before the Court is the petition for review on 
certiorari

 filed by the Office of the Ombudsman and Dennis M. Villa-Ignacio, in 
his capacity as the Special Prosecutor, Office of the Ombudsman, seeking
 the reversal of the Decision
[1]

 dated June 25, 2004 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 
83091. The assailed decision set aside the Order dated March 17, 2004 
issued by petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio in 
OMB-C-A-03-0379-J placing respondent Atty. Gil A. Valera, Deputy 
Commissioner, Office of the Revenue Collection Monitoring Group, Bureau 
of Customs, under preventive suspension for a period of six months 
without pay.
Factual and Procedural Antecedents
Respondent
 Valera was appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs by 
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on July 13, 2001. He took his oath of 
office on August 3, 2001 and assumed his post on August 7, 2001. He is 
in charge of the Revenue Collection Monitoring Group.
On August 
20, 2003, the Office of the Ombudsman received the Sworn Complaint dated
 July 28, 2003 filed by then Director Eduardo S. Matillano of the 
Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group 
(PNP-CIDG). In the said sworn complaint, Director Matillano charged 
respondent Valera with criminal offenses involving violation of various 
provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019,
[2]
 the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (TCCP), Executive Order No. 38,
[3]
 Executive Order No. 298
[4]
 and R.A. No. 6713
[5]

 as well as administrative offenses of Grave Misconduct and Serious 
Irregularity in the Performance of Duty. Likewise subject of the same 
sworn complaint was respondent Valeraâs brother-in-law Ariel Manongdo 
for violation of Section 4 of R.A. No. 3019.
The sworn complaint alleged that:
On
 January 30, 2002, while in the performance of his official functions, 
Atty. Gil A. Valera had compromised the case against the Steel Asia 
Manufacturing Corporation in Civil Case No. 01-102504 before Branch 39, 
RTC, Manila without proper authority from the Commissioner of the Bureau
 of Customs in violation of Section 2316 TCCP (Authority of Commission 
to make Compromise) and without the approval of the President, in 
violation of Executive Order No. 156 and Executive Order No. 38. Such 
illegal acts of Atty. Gil A. Valera, indeed, caused undue injury to the 
government by having deprived the government of its right to collect the
 
legal interest, surcharges, litigation expenses
 and 
damages
 and gave the Steel Asia unwarranted benefits in the total 
uncollected
 amount of 
FOURTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN PESOS AND SEVENTY CENTAVOS (P14,762,467.70)
, which is violative of Sections 3(e) and (g) respectively of RA 3019.
Further
 investigation disclosed that Atty. Gil A. Valera while being a Bureau 
of Customs official directly and indirectly had financial or pecuniary 
interest in the CACTUS CARGOES SYSTEMS a brokerage whose line of 
business or transaction, in connection with which, he intervenes or 
takes part in his official capacity by way of causing the employment of 
his brother-in-law, Ariel Manongdo, thus, violating Section 3(h) of RA 
3019 and RA 6713 and Section 4, RA 3019 as against Ariel Manongdo.
Finally,
 investigation also disclosed that on April 21, 2002 Atty. Gil A. Valera
 traveled to Hongkong with his family without proper authority from the 
Office of the President in violation of Executive Order No. 298 (foreign
 travel of government personnel) dated May 19, 1995, thus, he committed 
an administrative offense of Grave Misconduct.
[6]
The sworn complaint prayed that:
1)
 Appropriate preliminary investigation be conducted with the end-in-view
 of filing the necessary information before the Sandiganbayan;
2)
 Pending investigation, Atty. Gil A. Valera be indefinitely suspended 
from public office in order to prevent him from further committing acts 
of irregularity in public office;
3) This Group be furnished a copy of the Resolution of this (
sic
) cases.
[7]
At
 about the same time as the filing of the complaint against respondent 
Valera, Director Matillano also filed charges against other officials of
 the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Bureau of 
Customs. The Philippine Daily Inquirer featured a news article on them 
with the title â
More govât execs flunk lifestyle check.
â
[8]
Prior
 to Director Matillanoâs sworn complaint, criminal and administrative 
charges were also filed with the Office of the Ombudsman by Atty. Adolfo
 CasareÃ±o against respondent Valera. The complaint of Atty. CasareÃ±o 
contained similar allegations as those in the complaint of Director 
Matillano in that respondent Valera, without being duly authorized by 
the Commissioner of Customs, entered into a compromise agreement with 
Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. in Civil Case No. 01-102504 to the 
prejudice of the government.
The cases against respondent Valera before the Ombudsman were docketed as follows:
OMB-C-C-02-0568-I
 (For: Violation of Sec. 3(e), R.A. 3019, as amended, and Section 3604 
of the Tariff and Customs Code) entitled 
Alfredo CasareÃ±o v. Gil A. Valera and Antonio M. Lorenzana
OMB-C-C-03-0547-J (For: Violation of Sec. 3(e), (g) and (h) of R.A. 3019, as amended) entitled 
PNP-CIDG v. Gil A. Valera and Ariel N. Manongdo
OMB-C-A-0379-J (For: Grave Misconduct and Serious Irregularity in the Performance of Duty) entitled 
PNP-CIDG v. Gil A. Valera
On November 12, 2003, Ombudsman Simeon V. Marcelo issued a Memorandum
[9]

 inhibiting himself from the foregoing criminal cases as well as the 
related administrative case and directing petitioner Special Prosecutor 
Villa-Ignacio to act in his (the Ombudsmanâs) stead and place. The said 
memorandum reads:

(Sgd.) SIMEON V. MARCELO
Tanodbayan
(Ombudsman)
On
 March 17, 2004, pursuant to the above memorandum, petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio, in the administrative case OMB-C-A-0379-J, 
issued the Order placing respondent Valera under preventive suspension 
for six months without pay. In the said order, petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio found that respondent Valera entered into the 
compromise agreement with Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. in Civil Case 
No. 01-102504 without being duly authorized to do so by the Commissioner
 of Customs and without the approval of the Secretary of Finance in 
violation of Section 2316
[10]
 of the TCCP.
As
 earlier mentioned, Civil Case No. 01-102504 was a collection suit filed
 by the Republic of the Philippines represented by the Bureau of Customs
 against Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. for payment of duties and taxes 
amounting to P37,195,859.00. The said amount was allegedly paid by Steel
 Asia Manufacturing Corp. with spurious tax credit certificates. In 
addition to the principal amount, the government likewise demanded 
payment of penalty charges (25% thereof), legal interest from date of 
demand, litigation expenses and exemplary damages.
Petitioner 
Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio made the finding that by entering into 
the said compromise agreement whereby Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. 
shall pay the overdue taxes and duties in thirty (30) monthly 
installments of P1,239,862 from January 2002 to June 2004, respondent 
Valera may have made concessions that may be deemed highly prejudicial 
to the government, 
i.e.,
 waiver of the legal interest from the 
amount demanded, penalty charges imposed by law, litigation expenses and
 exemplary damages. Further, by the terms of the compromise agreement, 
respondent Valera had virtually exonerated Steel Asia Manufacturing 
Corp. of its fraudulent acts of using spurious tax credit certificates.
Petitioner
 Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio concluded the Order dated March 17, 
2004 by stating that â[c]onsidering the strong evidence of guilt of 
respondent Deputy Commissioner Valera and the fact that the charges 
against him consist of Grave Misconduct and/or Dishonesty which may 
warrant his removal from the service, it is hereby declared that the 
requirements under Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, in relation to Sec. 9, 
Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7, on the Rules of Procedure of the
 Office of the Ombudsman, as amended, are present, and placing 
respondent Deputy Commissioner Valera under preventive suspension 
pending administrative investigation on the matter for a period of six 
(6) months without pay is clearly justified.â
[11]
The decretal portion of the March 17, 2004 Order reads:
WHEREFORE,

 pursuant to Sec. 24 of R.A. No. 6770, otherwise known as the Ombudsman 
Act of 1989, in relation to Sec. 9, Rule III of Administrative Order No.
 7, respondent ATTY. GIL A. VALERA, Deputy Commissioner, Office of the 
Collection and Monitoring Group, Bureau of Customs, is hereby placed 
under preventive suspension for SIX (6) MONTHS WITHOUT PAY.
Pursuant to Sec. 27(1) of R.A. No. 6770, this Order of Preventive Suspension is deemed immediately effective and executory.
The
 Honorable Commissioner Antonio M. Bernard, Bureau of Customs, is hereby
 directed to implement the Order immediately upon receipt hereof and to 
promptly inform this Office of compliance herewith.
Respondent 
Atty. Gil A. Valera, Deputy Commissioner, Office of the Collection and 
Monitoring Group, Bureau of Customs, is hereby ordered to file his 
counter-affidavit and other controverting evidence to the complaint, 
copy of which together with the annexes, is hereto attached, within ten 
(10) days from receipt hereof in three (3) legible copies addressed to 
the Central Records Division, Office of the Ombudsman, Ombudsman 
Building, Agham Road, Government Center, North Triangle, Diliman, Quezon
 City, furnishing the complainant with a copy of said counter-affidavit.
Further,
 respondent is also ordered to submit proof of service of his 
counter-affidavit to the complaint, who may file its reply thereto 
within a period of ten (10) days from receipt of the same.
Failure
 to comply as herein directed within the period prescribed by the rules 
shall be deemed as a waiver of the right to submit the partyâs 
counter-affidavit or reply, nonetheless, despite said non-filing, the 
investigation shall proceed pursuant to existing rules.
This Order is being issued by the undersigned in view of the inhibition of the Honorable 
Tanodbayan
 Simeon Marcelo from his case as contained in a Memorandum dated 12 November 2003.
SO ORDERED.
[12]
Respondent
 Valera sought reconsideration of the said Order claiming denial of due 
process. He averred that he had already submitted his counter-affidavit 
refuting the charges leveled against him by the PNP-CIDG way back on 
November 6, 2003. He pointed out that Director Matillanoâs sworn 
complaint was filed on August 20, 2003 and it was only two months later 
or on October 22, 2003 that the Ombudsman found enough basis to proceed 
with the administrative investigation of the case by requiring 
respondent Valera to file his counter-affidavit. He did so on November 
6, 2003. During the said period of two months, the Preliminary 
Investigation and Administrative Adjudication Bureau-A (PIAB-A) of the 
Office of the Ombudsman did not find enough bases to preventively 
suspend him. According to respondent Valera, he was at a loss as to why 
it was only then (March 17, 2004) that he was being placed under 
preventive suspension.
Acting on respondent Valeraâs motion for 
reconsideration, petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio issued the 
Order dated April 5, 2004 explaining that the delay in the issuance of 
the preventive suspension order was due to the inhibition of the 
Ombudsman from the case and for which reason, he (petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio), by virtue of the Memorandum dated November 
12, 2003, had to act in his place and stead.  Petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio averred that contrary to respondent Valeraâs 
assertion, his counter-affidavit would not justify the reversal of the 
March 17, 2004 Order since he failed to show that he had the requisite 
authority from the Commissioner of Customs to enter into the said 
compromise agreement with respect to the Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. 
case. It was not shown under what authority and on what basis respondent
 Valera entered into the said compromise agreement.
In light of 
the foregoing ratiocination, petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio
 denied respondent Valeraâs motion for reconsideration. The decretal 
portion of his Order dated April 5, 2004 reads:
WHEREFORE,
 the undersigned finds no cogent reason to reconsider the suspension 
order previously issued dated 17 March 2004 but considers the 
Counter-Affidavit received by the Office of the Ombudsman 06 November 
2003 as sufficient compliance to the portion of the assailed Order 
directing him to file his counter-affidavit. Consequently, the Order 
insofar as it requires him to file counter-affidavit contained in the 17
 March 200
[4]
 Order is SET ASIDE.
[13]
Even
 before his motion for reconsideration was acted upon, however, 
respondent Valera already filed with the Court of Appeals a special 
civil action for certiorari and prohibition as he sought to nullify the 
March 17, 2004 Order of preventive suspension issued by petitioner 
Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio and to enjoin Commissioner of Customs 
Antonio M. Bernardo from implementing the said Order.
On April 
16, 2004, the appellate court heard the parties on oral arguments on the
 prayer for injunction. On even date, it issued a temporary restraining 
order against the implementation of the preventive suspension order.
On
 June 25, 2004, the appellate court rendered the assailed Decision 
setting aside the March 17, 2004 Order of preventive suspension and 
directing petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio to desist from 
taking any further action in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J.
In so ruling, the
 CA held mainly that petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio is not 
authorized by law to sign and issue preventive suspension orders. It 
cited Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, otherwise known as âThe Ombudsman Act
 of 1989,â which vests on the âOmbudsman and his Deputyâ the power to 
preventively suspend any government officer or employee under the 
Ombudsmanâs authority pending investigation subject to certain 
conditions. In relation thereto, Section 5, Article XI of the 
Constitution was also cited as it states that the Office of the 
Ombudsman is âcomposed of the Ombudsman to be known as the Tanodbayan, 
one overall Deputy, and at least one Deputy each for Luzon, Visayas and 
Mindanao. A separate Deputy for the military establishment may likewise 
be appointed.â
Relying on these two provisions of law, the CA 
declared that petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio has no 
authority to issue a preventive suspension order since he is neither the
 Ombudsman nor one of the Deputy Ombudsmen.
The CA was not 
persuaded by petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacioâs contention 
that his authority to issue the March 17, 2004 Order of preventive 
suspension could be found in Section 11(4)(c) of R.A. No. 6770 which 
provides that the Office of the Special Prosecutor shall, in addition to
 those powers expressly enumerated in the said provision, âperform such 
other duties assigned to it by the Ombudsman.â The CA held that the 
grant of such power to the Office of the Special Prosecutor is subject 
to the condition that it shall be âunder the supervision and control and
 upon the authority of the Ombudsman.â
However, according to the 
CA, by virtue of the Memorandum dated November 12, 2003 of Ombudsman 
Marcelo where he stated that he was inhibiting himself and directing 
petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio to act in his place and 
stead, the latter (petitioner Special Prosecutor) officially stepped 
into the position of the Ombudsman insofar as the subject case is 
concerned. In effect, petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio would 
act as the Ombudsman. The CA opined that this is not the kind of duties 
contemplated under Section 11(4)(c) of R.A. No. 6770.
Ombudsman 
Marceloâs Memorandum dated November 12, 2003 was declared null and void 
by the appellate court for the following reasons:
The
 issuance of that kind of a memorandum effectively stretched (or 
over-stretched) the limited powers of the special prosecutor under R.A. 
No. 6770 and the Constitution;
The issuance of that kind
 of a memorandum has effectively placed the special prosecutor over and 
above all of the five (5) deputies of the Ombudsman in terms of 
hierarchy with respect to administrative adjudication;
To
 put it lightly, the Ombudsman, in issuing that kind of a memorandum, 
has, wittingly or unwittingly, permitted the Office of the Special 
Prosecutor to perform the administrative adjudicative powers of the 
Ombudsman not only to issue preventive suspension but to perform, 
without qualification, any and all other administrative adjudicative 
powers, duties functions and responsibilities pertaining to the former 
as provided under R.A. No. 6770 and the Constitution.
[14]
In
 addition, the CA refuted the finding of petitioner Special Prosecutor 
Villa-Ignacio that the evidence of guilt against respondent Valera is 
strong to warrant his preventive suspension. The CA proffered the 
following circumstances as negating the said finding of petitioner 
Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio: (1) Unlike the other four government 
officials who were simultaneously charged with him, respondent Valera 
was not immediately placed under preventive suspension; hence, 
indicating that there was no strong evidence against him; (2) Petitioner
 Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacioâs comment filed with the appellate 
court did not make any reference to respondent Valeraâs supposed foreign
 travel violation which was alleged in the sworn complaint of Director 
Matillano; and (3) The admission of petitioner Special Prosecutor 
Villa-Ignacioâs counsel during the oral arguments on the preliminary 
injunction that the PIAB-A recommended against placing respondent Valera
 under preventive suspension.
Finally, the CA strongly denounced 
petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio for issuing the preventive 
suspension order without even considering respondent Valeraâs 
counter-affidavit and, worse, not knowing that he had already filed it 
as early as November 5, 2003.  The CA opined that had petitioner Special
 Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio duly considered the said counter-affidavit, he
 would have reached a different conclusion, i.e., there is no strong 
evidence against respondent Valera. Further, that the latter, in 
entering into the compromise agreement with Steel Asia Manufacturing 
Corp., is authorized to do so under Section 2401
[15]

 of the TCCP and Section 2316 thereof, cited by petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio, is inapplicable. The CA concluded that 
petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio acted with grave abuse of 
discretion in issuing the March 17, 2004 placing respondent Valera under
 preventive suspension for six months without pay in connection with the
 administrative case OMB-C-A-03-0379-J.
The decretal portion of the decision of the appellate court reads:
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is hereby GRANTED, and the assailed order of March 17, 
2004, issued by respondent Dennis Villa-Ignacio in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J is 
SET ASIDE.
Respondent Special Prosecutor is DIRECTED to desist from taking any further action in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J.
SO ORDERED.
[16]
Hence, the recourse to this Court by petitioners Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio and the Office of the Ombudsman.
The Petitionersâ Case
They submit the following as grounds for the allowance of their petition:
IN
 ITS DECISION DATED 25 JUNE 2004, THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS
 ERROR IN FINDING THAT THE PETITIONER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR COMMITTED GRAVE
 ABUSE OF DISCRETION, AND IN SETTING ASIDE THE MARCH 17, 2004 ORDER OF 
PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION ISSUED BY THE PETITIONER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, 
CONSIDERING THAT:
I
[PETITIONER]
 SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ACTED WITH FULL AUTHORITY CONSIDERING THAT THE 
OMBUDSMAN EXPRESSLY ASSIGNED TO [PETITIONER] SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THE 
SPECIFIC FUNCTION OF ACTING IN HIS (OMBUDSMANâS) PLACE AND STEAD IN 
OMB-C-A-030379-J, AND THIS DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY SUFFERS FROM NO VICE 
OR DEFECT AND, ON THE CONTRARY, HAS THE FULL MANDATE OF THE LAW.
II
NO
 GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION HAS BEEN COMMITTED BY THE PETITIONERS IN 
FINDING, AT THAT STAGE, THE EVIDENCE OF GUILT TO BE STRONG ON THE PART 
OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT, FOR GRAVE MISCONDUCT AND/OR DISHONESTY.
III
PRIVATE RESPONDENTâS PETITION FILED BEFORE THE COURT 
A QUO
 SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED FOR VIOLATION OF THE RULE ON FORUM SHOPPING.
[17]
The
 petitioners vigorously maintain that no grave abuse of discretion 
attended the issuance by petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio of 
the March 17, 2004 Order placing respondent Valera under preventive 
suspension because the Ombudsman, in directing petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio to act in his place and stead insofar as 
OMB-C-A-03-0379-J was concerned, fully clothed the latter with delegated
 authority to act thereon. Since under Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, the 
Ombudsman may preventively suspend respondent Valera in the subject 
administrative case, it follows that with the delegation of his 
authority to petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio, he had full 
authority to preventively suspend respondent Valera. Petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio, upon finding that all the elements for 
preventive suspension in Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770 are present, 
accordingly placed respondent Valera under preventive suspension for six
 months without pay in connection with the subject administrative case.
The
 petitioners defend the validity of the Ombudsmanâs delegation of his 
authority to petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio with respect to
 the administrative case OMB-C-A-03-0379-J contending that: âa) the 
authority to preventively suspend is not insusceptible to delegation to 
an alter ego of the Ombudsman; b) the petitioner Special Prosecutor 
possessed the necessary qualifications and competence to exercise the 
delegated functions; c) no law or rule was violated with the said 
delegation.â
[18]
Nothing
 in Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770 allegedly prohibits the delegation by 
the Ombudsman of his authority to preventively suspend to his alter ego.
 The petitioners point out that under R.A. No. 6770, the Special 
Prosecutor, like the Deputy Ombudsmen, heads a major office in the 
Office of the Ombudsman;
[19]
 he is appointed in the same manner as the Deputy Ombudsmen;
[20]
 he shares the same qualifications
[21]
 and enjoys the same rank and privilege as the latter.
[22]

 As such, the Special Prosecutor, like any of the other Deputy 
Ombudsmen, has the competence and capability to preventively suspend any
 officer or employee under the authority of the Ombudsman.
The petitioners invoke, in particular, Section 11(4)(c) of R.A. No. 6770:
Sec. 11. 
Structural Organization.
 â
â¦
(4)
 The Office of the Special Prosecutor shall, under the supervision and 
control and upon the authority of the Ombudsman, have the following 
powers:
â¦
(c) To perform such other duties assigned to it by the Ombudsman.
By
 this provision, the Ombudsman may allegedly validly delegate to the 
Special Prosecutor such other functions that he cannot, otherwise, 
perform by himself and that he (the Ombudsman) is not obliged to always 
make such delegation to the Overall Deputy Ombudsman. In the exercise of
 quasi-judicial functions, there is no law which mandates that the 
Ombudsman can only inhibit himself in favor of the Deputy Ombudsmen.
The
 petitioners assert that the evidence of respondent Valeraâs guilt for 
serious administrative infractions is strong. According to them, the 
facts that have so far been established show that respondent Valera 
entered into the compromise agreement with Steel Manufacturing Asia 
Corp. to unduly shield and promote its interests and to the prejudice of
 the government. It is allegedly suspicious that he (respondent Valera) 
simply allowed the said company to redeem the spurious tax credit 
certificates with a 30-month staggered payment when sufficient 
properties of the said company had already been attached to satisfy not 
only the P37 million principal amount of taxes owed by the said company 
but the penalty charges and damages as well. He further unjustifiably 
exonerated the said companyâs officers of any criminal wrongdoing when 
they are conclusively liable for the procurement of these spurious tax 
credit certificates. Further, respondent Valera was never authorized by 
the Customs Commissioner to enter into such compromise agreement nor was
 it approved by the Secretary of Finance as required by Section 2316 of 
the TCCP. Neither was it approved by the President of the Philippines as
 further required by E.O. No. 38. Respondent Valera thus committed an 
act of misrepresentation when he signed the compromise agreement under 
the clause â
By authority of the Commissioner.
â
The 
petitioners posit that conclusively at the given stage respondent Valera
 appeared to have committed Grave Misconduct and Dishonesty to warrant 
his preventive suspension. They also aver that the evidence strongly 
show that respondent Valera obtained employment for his brother-in-law, 
Ariel Manongdo, with Cactus Cargo Systems, Inc., a customs brokerage 
firm whose business principally involves dealing on a regular basis with
 the Bureau of Customs, in contravention of R.A. No. 6713 and R.A. No. 
3019.
To refute the appellate courtâs statement that there was 
inordinate delay in the issuance of the March 17, 2004 Order of 
preventive suspension, the petitioners explain that the same was due to,
 among others, the inhibition of the Ombudsman from the case, the delay 
in the transmittal of the case records and the amount of time that it 
took petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio to study the 
recommendation of the PIAB-A and the divergent recommendation of the 
Assistant Ombudsman for Preliminary Investigation, Adjudication and 
Monitoring Office (PAMO).
Moreover, even if the PIAB-A 
recommended against placing respondent Valera under preventive 
suspension, petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio was not bound to
 adopt the same. With respect to respondent Valeraâs counter-affidavit, 
the petitioners insist that the same failed to rebut the strong evidence
 against him; hence, justifying his preventive suspension.
Finally,
 the petitioners fault the appellate court for not dismissing outright 
respondent Valeraâs petition for certiorari. They charge him with 
violation of the rule on non-forum shopping as he filed his petition for
 certiorari with the CA even when his motion for reconsideration had yet
 to be acted upon by petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio.
The Respondentâs Counter-Arguments
Respondent
 Valera mainly argues that petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio 
has no authority to issue the March 17, 2004 Order placing him under 
preventive suspension. While Section 11(4)(c) of R.A. No. 6770 grants 
the Office of the Special Prosecutor the power to âperform such other 
duties assigned to it by the Ombudsman,â the performance of such other 
duties should still be âunder the supervision and control and upon the 
authority of the Ombudsman.â Respondent Valera echoes the ratiocination 
of the CA that the Memorandum dated November 12, 2003 issued by 
Ombudsman Marcelo directing petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio 
to act in his place and stead in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J produced the effect 
of making him (petitioner Special Prosecutor) step into the position of 
the Ombudsman. This is not the kind of assignment of duties contemplated
 by Section 11(4)(c) of R.A. No. 6770 because, in such a case, the 
Ombudsmanâs power of supervision and control over the Special Prosecutor
 is undermined.
Respondent Valera submits that the Ombudsmanâs 
memorandum designating petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio to 
act in his place and stead has destroyed the hierarchy of command within
 the Office of the Ombudsman because it put the Special Prosecutor over 
and above the Office of the Overall Deputy Ombudsman. Such designation 
infringes on Section 11(2) of R.A. No. 6770 which provides that the 
Overall Deputy Ombudsman âshall oversee and administer the operations of
 the different offices under the Office of the Ombudsman.â The Overall 
Deputy Ombudsman is next in line to the Ombudsman as shown by the fact 
that he assumes as Acting Ombudsman in case of vacancy in the Office of 
the Ombudsman due to death, resignation, removal or permanent disability
 of the incumbent Ombudsman.
Respondent Valera stresses that the 
power to preventively suspend any officer or employee under the 
authority of the Ombudsman pending investigation is exclusively vested 
on the Ombudsman or his Deputy pursuant to Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770. 
Since the Special Prosecutor is not named therein as vested with the 
said power, then petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio has no 
authority to issue a preventive suspension.
In relation thereto, 
the Special Prosecutorâs powers is allegedly limited to the conduct of 
preliminary investigation and prosecution of criminal cases within the 
jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Respondent Valera cites the 
enumeration of the Special Prosecutorâs powers in Section 11(4) of R.A. 
No. 6770:
Sec. 11. Structural Organization. â
â¦
(4)
 The Office of the Special Prosecutor shall, under the supervision and 
control and upon the authority of the Ombudsman, have the following 
powers:
(a) To conduct preliminary investigation and prosecute criminal cases within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan;
(b) To enter into plea bargaining agreement; and
(c) To perform such other duties assigned to it by the Ombudsman.
Applying the rule of 
ejusdem generis
,
 respondent Valera theorizes that since the first two powers relate to 
criminal complaints and criminal cases, then the last power â âto 
perform such other duties assigned to it by the Ombudsmanâ â can only 
refer to other duties related to criminal complaints and criminal cases 
and not to administrative complaints, investigation, adjudication and 
administrative preventive suspension. While he concedes that the 
Ombudsman may inhibit himself in certain cases, respondent Valera is of 
the view that when the Ombudsman does inhibit himself in an 
administrative investigation pending before the Office of the Ombudsman,
 he may not designate the Special Prosecutor to act in his place and 
stead.
Respondent Valera also harps on petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacioâs alleged failure to consider his (respondent 
Valeraâs) counter-affidavit before issuing the preventive suspension 
order. This omission coupled with the delay in issuing the same 
allegedly renders the March 17, 2004 Order null and void.
On the 
evidence against him, respondent Valera claims that the same is not 
strong. He cites the delay in placing him under preventive suspension as
 he alleges that the first complaint involving the Steel Manufacturing 
Asia Corp. case was filed against him by Atty. CasareÃ±o as early as 
August 26, 2002. However, it was only on March 17, 2004 that he was 
placed under preventive suspension by petitioner Special Prosecutor 
Villa-Ignacio. The strength of the evidence against him is also belied 
by the fact that the PIAB-A recommended against placing him under 
preventive suspension.
On the procedural point, respondent Valera
 states that he filed the petition for certiorari with the CA without 
awaiting the resolution of his motion for reconsideration because, at 
the time, petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio still had not 
resolved the same despite the lapse of the period provided by the 
Ombudsmanâs rules of procedure.
Issue
The
 basic issue for the Courtâs resolution is whether petitioner Special 
Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio has the authority to place respondent Valera 
under preventive suspension in connection with the administrative case 
OMB-C-A-03-0379-J pending before the Office of the Ombudsman.
The Courtâs Ruling
The Court holds that the Special Prosecutor has no such authority.
Preliminarily,
 it is noted that petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio anchors 
his authority to conduct the administrative investigation in 
OMB-C-A-03-0379-J on the Memorandum dated November 12, 2003 issued by 
Ombudsman Marcelo inhibiting himself therefrom and directing petitioner 
Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio to act in his place and stead.
Significantly,
 Ombudsman Marcelo did not state in the said memorandum the reason for 
his inhibition. On this point, the rule on voluntary inhibition of 
judges finds application to the Ombudsman in the performance of his 
functions particularly in administrative proceedings like 
OMB-C-A-03-0379-J. Like judges, the decision on whether or not to 
inhibit is admittedly left to the Ombudsmanâs sound discretion and 
conscience.
[23]
 However, again
 similar to judges, Ombudsman Marcelo has no unfettered discretion to 
inhibit himself. The inhibition must be for just and valid causes.
[24]
 No such cause was proffered by Ombudsman Marcelo for his inhibition in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J.
The Court shall now proceed to resolve the basic issue of the case.
The Ombudsman, pursuant to his power of
supervision and control over the Special
Prosecutor, may authorize the latter to
conduct administrative investigation
The Office of the Ombudsman is vested by the Constitution with the following powers, functions and duties:
(1)
 Investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or 
omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such 
act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient;
(2)
 Direct, upon complaint or at its own instance, any public official or 
employee of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or 
instrumentality thereof, as well as of any government-owned and 
controlled corporation with original charter, to perform and expedite 
any act or duty required by law, or to stop, prevent and correct any 
abuse or impropriety in the performance of duties;
(3) Direct the
 officer concerned to take appropriate action against a public official 
or employee at fault, and recommend his removal, suspension, demotion, 
fine, censure, or prosecution, and ensure compliance therewith;
(4)
 Direct the officer concerned, in any appropriate case, and subject to 
such limitations as may be provided by law to furnish it with copies of 
documents relating to contracts or transactions entered into by his 
office involving the disbursement or use of public funds or properties, 
and report any irregularity to the Commission on Audit for appropriate 
action;
(5) Request any government agency for assistance an 
information necessary in the discharge of its responsibilities, and to 
examine, if necessary, pertinent and records and documents;
(6) Publicize matters covered by its investigation when circumstances so warrant and with due prudence;
(7)
 Determine the causes of inefficiency, red tape, mismanagement, fraud 
and corruption in the Government and make recommendations for their 
elimination and the observance of high standards of ethics and 
efficiency; and
(8) Promulgate its rules of procedure and 
exercise such other powers or perform such functions or duties as may be
 provided by law.
[25]
R.A.
 No. 6770 was enacted to provide for the functional and structural 
organization of the Office of the Ombudsman. It substantially reiterates
 the constitutional provisions relating to the Office of the Ombudsman. 
In addition, R.A. No. 6770 granted to the Office of the Ombudsman 
prosecutorial functions
[26]
 and made the Office of the Special Prosecutor an organic component of the Office of the Ombudsman.
[27]

 As such, R.A. No. 6770 vests on the Office of the Special Prosecutor, 
under the supervision and control and upon the authority of the 
Ombudsman, the following powers:
(a) To conduct preliminary investigation and prosecute criminal cases within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan;
(b) To enter into plea bargaining agreement; and
(c) To perform such other duties assigned to it by the Ombudsman.
[28]
Based
 on the pertinent provisions of the Constitution and R.A. No. 6770, the 
powers of the Ombudsman have generally been categorized into the 
following: investigatory power; prosecutory power; public assistance 
functions; authority to inquire and obtain information; and function to 
adopt, institute and implement preventive measures.
[29]
 The Ombudsmanâs investigatory and prosecutory power has been characterized as plenary and unqualified:
The
 power to investigate and to prosecute granted by law to the Ombudsman 
is plenary and unqualified. It pertains to any act or omission of 
any public officer or employee when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient
â¦
[30]
On the other hand, the authority of the Office of the Special Prosecutor has been characterized as limited:
Moreover,
 the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman should not be equated 
with the limited authority of the Special Prosecutor under Section 11 of
 R.A. 6770. The Office of the Special Prosecutor is merely a component 
of the Office of the Ombudsman and may act only under the supervision 
and control and upon the authority of the Ombudsman. Its power to 
conduct preliminary investigation and prosecute is limited to criminal 
cases within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Certainly, the 
lawmakers did not intend to confine the investigatory and prosecutory 
power of the Ombudsman to these types of cases. The Ombudsman is 
mandated by law to act on all complaints against officers and employees 
of the government and to enforce their administrative, civil and 
criminal liability in every case where the evidence warrants. To carry 
out this duty, the law allows him to utilize the personnel in his office
 and/or designate any fiscal, state prosecutor or lawyer in the 
government service to act as special investigator or prosecutor to 
assist in the investigation and prosecution of certain cases. Those 
designated or deputized to assist him work under his supervision and 
control. The law likewise allows him to direct the Special Prosecutor to
 prosecute cases outside the Sandiganbayanâs jurisdiction in accordance 
with Section 11(4c) of R.A. 6770.
[31]
The
 Court has consistently held that the Office of the Special Prosecutor 
is merely a component of the Office of the Ombudsman and may only act 
under the supervision and control and upon authority of the Ombudsman.
[32]
Section 38(1), Chapter 7, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987 defines âsupervision and controlâ thus:
(1) 
Supervision and Control
.
 â Supervision and control shall include authority to act directly 
whenever a specific function is entrusted by law or regulation to a 
subordinate; direct the performance of duty; restrain the commission of 
acts; review, approve, reverse or modify acts and decisions of 
subordinate officials or units; determine priorities in the execution of
 plans and programs; and prescribe standards, guidelines, plans and 
programs. Unless a different meaning is explicitly provided in the 
specific law governing the relationship of particular agencies, the word
 âcontrolâ shall encompass supervision and control as defined in this 
paragraph.
The power of supervision and control has been likewise explained as follows:
In
 administrative law, supervision means overseeing or the power or 
authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their 
duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may 
take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform such 
duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to 
alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had 
done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of 
the former for that of the latter.
[33]
Pursuant
 to its power of supervision and control, the Office of the Ombudsman is
 empowered under Section 15(10) of R.A. No. 6770 to:
(10)
 Delegate to the Deputies, or its investigators or representatives such 
authority or duty as shall ensure the effective exercise or performance 
of the powers, functions, and duties herein or hereinafter provided;
â¦
Complementary thereto, Section 11(4)(c) thereof requires the latter to:
(c) [p]erform such other duties assigned to it by the Ombudsman.
Hence,
 under the foregoing provisions, the Ombudsman may delegate his 
investigatory function, including the power to conduct administrative 
investigation, to the Special Prosecutor.
Section 24 of R.A. No 6770, however, grants
the power to preventively suspend only to the
Ombudsman and the Deputy Ombudsmen
Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770 reads:
Sec. 24. 
Preventive Suspension.

 â The Ombudsman and his Deputy may preventively suspend any officer or 
employee under his authority pending an investigation, if in his 
judgment the evidence of guilt is strong, and (a) the charge against 
such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave 
misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty;  (b) the charges would
 warrant removal from the service; or (c) the respondentâs continued 
stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.
The 
preventive suspension shall continue until the case is terminated by the
 Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six months, without pay, 
except when the delay in the disposition of the case by the Office of 
the Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the 
respondent, in which case the period of such delay shall not be counted 
in computing the period of suspension herein provided.
It
 is observed that R.A. No. 6770 has invariably mentioned the Special 
Prosecutor alongside the Ombudsman and/or the Deputy Ombudsmen with 
respect to the manner of appointment,
[34]
 qualifications,
[35]
 term of office,
[36]
 grounds for removal from office,
[37]
 prohibitions and disqualifications
[38]
 and disclosure of relationship requirement.
[39]

 However, with respect to the grant of the power to preventively 
suspend, Section 24 of R.A. No 6770 makes no mention of the Special 
Prosecutor. The obvious import of this exclusion is to withhold from the
 Special Prosecutor the power to preventively suspend. It is a basic 
precept of statutory construction that the express mention of one 
person, thing, act or consequence excludes all others as expressed in 
the familiar maxim 
expressio unius est exclusio alterius
.
[40]
The
 petitionersâ contention that since the Special Prosecutor is of the 
same rank as that of a Deputy Ombudsman, then the former can rightfully 
perform all the functions of the latter, including the power to 
preventively suspend, is not persuasive. Under civil service laws, rank 
classification determines the salary and status of government officials 
and employees.
[41]
 Although 
there is substantial equality in the level of their respective 
functions, those occupying the same rank do not necessarily have the 
same powers nor perform the same functions.
The Ombudsman and the
 Deputy Ombudsmen, as they are expressly named in Section 24 of R.A. No.
 6770, have been granted the power to preventively suspend as the same 
inheres in their mandate under the Constitution:
Sec. 12.
 The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act 
promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public 
officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency, or
 instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled 
corporations, and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants 
of the action taken and the result thereof.
[42]
While
 R.A. No. 6770 accords the Special Prosecutor the same rank as that of 
the Deputy Ombudsmen, Section 24 thereof expressly grants only to the 
Ombudsman and the Deputy Ombudsmen the power to place under preventive 
suspension government officials and employees under their authority 
pending an administrative investigation.
[43]
However,
 if the Ombudsman delegates his authority to conduct administrative 
investigation to the Special Prosecutor and the latter finds that the 
preventive suspension of the public official or employee subject thereof
 is warranted, the Special Prosecutor may recommend to the Ombudsman to 
place the said public officer or employee under preventive suspension.
Pertinently,
 the investigation of OMB-C-A-03-0379-J was initially conducted by the 
PIAB-A, a panel composed of two Special Prosecution Officers III
[44]
 and Graft Investigation and Prosecution Officers II.
[45]

 The said investigating panel submitted to the Ombudsman the Memorandum 
dated November 5, 2003 which contained its initial findings stating in 
part thus:
After a careful evaluation of the complaint, 
it appears that the evidence of guilt in the case under review, in the 
context of Sec. 24, R.A. 6770, are not strong enough to warrant the 
imposition of preventive suspension of respondent Atty. Gil A. Valera. 
The evidence on record fall short of the quantum of evidence necessary 
to establish the necessary weight to preventively suspend him. However, 
the Investigating Panel finds enough basis to proceed with the 
administrative investigation of this case.
[46]
It
 appears in the signatory page of the said memorandum that the findings 
and recommendation therein were reviewed by the Director
[47]
 of the PIAB-A. Further, the memorandum was, likewise, reviewed by the Assistant Ombudsman,
[48]

 Preliminary Investigation, Adjudication and Monitoring Office (PAMO) 
with the notation ârecommending disapproval.â This demonstrates that in 
the conduct of administrative investigation, the PIAB-A exercises merely
 recommendatory powers particularly with respect to whether to place the
 public official or employee subject thereof under preventive 
suspension.
Ombudsman Marcelo designated the Special Prosecutor 
to conduct the administrative investigation. In the course thereof, 
petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio found that the preventive 
suspension of respondent Valera was warranted under Section 24 of R.A. 
No. 6770. However, since under the said provision only the Ombudsman or 
his Deputy may exercise the power of preventive suspension, petitioner 
Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio could only recommend to the Ombudsman 
or, in this case because of the latterâs inhibition, to the designated 
Deputy Ombudsman to place respondent Valera under preventive suspension.
Stated
 differently, with respect to the conduct of administrative 
investigation, the Special Prosecutorâs authority, insofar as preventive
 suspension is concerned, is akin to that of the PIAB-A, 
i.e.,
 
recommendatory in nature. It bears stressing that the power to place a 
public officer or employee under preventive suspension pending an 
investigation is lodged only with the Ombudsman or the Deputy Ombudsmen.
Consequently,
 petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio had no authority to issue 
the March 17, 2004 Order placing respondent Valera under preventive 
suspension for six months without pay in connection with the 
administrative case OMB-C-A-03-0379-J. The appellate court thus 
correctly nullified and set aside the said assailed order.
Considering
 the finding that petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio had no 
authority to issue the March 17, 2004 preventive suspension order, the 
resolution of the issue of whether or not the evidence of respondent 
Valeraâs guilt is strong to warrant his preventive suspension need not 
be passed upon at this point. Anent respondent Valeraâs alleged 
non-compliance with the rule on non-forum shopping when he filed the 
petition for certiorari with the appellate court, suffice it to state 
that the appellate court correctly overlooked this procedural lapse. The
 merits of respondent Valeraâs case are special circumstances or 
compelling reasons which justified the appellate courtâs relaxing the 
rule requiring certification on non-forum shopping.
[49]
It
 is well to mention, at this point, that after the appellate court 
rendered its decision nullifying the March 17, 2004 Order of petitioner 
Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio and directing him to desist from taking
 any further action in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J, the said case was next 
assigned to the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and 
Other Law Enforcement Offices (MOLEO), headed by Mr. Orlando C. 
Casimiro.
[50]
 The hearings in 
OMB-C-A-03-0379-J were, thus, continued by the Deputy Ombudsman for 
MOLEO. On August 30, 2004, a Decision was rendered in the said 
administrative case finding petitioner Valera guilty of grave misconduct
 and decreeing his dismissal from the service. On appeal, the Court of 
Appeals affirmed the decision of the Deputy Ombudsman for MOLEO. 
Petitioner Valera subsequently filed a petition for review with this 
Court assailing the said decision of the appellate court. The said 
petition, docketed as G.R. No. 167278, is now pending with the Court.
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
DENIED
.
 The Decision dated June 25, 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 83091, insofar as it set aside the March 17, 2004 Order issued by 
petitioner Special Prosecutor Villa-Ignacio in OMB-C-A-03-0379-J, is 
AFFIRMED
