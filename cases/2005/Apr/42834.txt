THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. NO. 159647, April 15, 2005 ]


COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. CENTRAL LUZON DRUG CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The 20 percent discount required by the law to be given to senior citizens is a 
tax credit
, not merely a 
tax deduction
 from the gross income or gross sale of the establishment concerned.  A 
tax credit
 is used by a private establishment only after the tax has been computed; a 
tax deduction
, before the tax is computed.  RA 7432 unconditionally grants a 
tax credit
 to all covered entities.  Thus, the provisions of the revenue regulation that withdraw or modify such grant are void.  Basic is the rule that administrative regulations cannot amend or revoke the law.
The Case
Before us is a Petition for Review
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the August 29, 2002 Decision
[2]
 and the August 11, 2003 Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 67439.  The assailed Decision reads as follows:
â
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Resolution appealed from is 
AFFIRMED
 
in toto
.  No costs.â
[4]
The assailed Resolution denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration.
The Facts
The CA narrated the antecedent facts as follows:
âRespondent is a domestic corporation primarily engaged in retailing of medicines and other pharmaceutical products.  In 1996, it operated six (6) drugstores under the business name and style âMercury Drug.â
âFrom January to December 1996, respondent granted twenty (20%) percent sales discount to qualified senior citizens on their purchases of medicines pursuant to Republic Act No. [R.A.] 7432 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.  For the said period, the amount allegedly representing the 20% sales discount granted by respondent to qualified senior citizens totaled P904,769.00.
âOn April 15, 1997, respondent filed its Annual Income Tax Return for taxable year 1996 declaring therein that it incurred net losses from its operations.
âOn January 16, 1998, respondent filed with petitioner a claim for tax refund/credit in the amount of P904,769.00 allegedly arising from the 20% sales discount granted by respondent to qualified senior citizens in compliance with [R.A.] 7432.  Unable to obtain affirmative response from petitioner, respondent elevated its claim to the Court of Tax Appeals [(CTA or Tax Court)] via a Petition for Review.
âOn February 12, 2001, the Tax Court rendered a Decision
[5]
 dismissing respondentâs Petition for lack of merit.  In said decision, the [CTA] justified its ruling with the following ratiocination:
âx x x, if no tax has been paid to the government, erroneously or illegally, or if no amount is due and collectible from the taxpayer, tax refund or tax credit is unavailing.  Moreover, whether the recovery of the tax is made by means of a claim for refund or tax credit, before recovery is allowed[,] it must be first established that there was an actual collection and receipt by the government of the tax sought to be recovered. x x x.
âx x x                x x x              x x x
âPrescinding from the above, it could logically be deduced that tax credit is premised on the existence of tax liability on the part of taxpayer.  In other words, if there is no tax liability, tax credit is not available.â
âRespondent lodged a Motion for Reconsideration.  The [CTA], in its assailed resolution,
[6]
 granted respondentâs motion for reconsideration and ordered herein petitioner to issue a Tax Credit Certificate in favor of respondent citing the decision of the then Special Fourth Division of [the CA] in CA G.R. SP No. 60057 entitled â
Central [Luzon] Drug Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
â promulgated on May 31, 2001, to wit:
âHowever, Sec. 229 clearly does not apply in the instant case because the tax sought to be refunded or credited by petitioner was not erroneously paid or illegally collected.  We take exception to the CTAâs sweeping but unfounded statement that âboth tax refund and tax credit are modes of recovering taxes which are either erroneously or illegally paid to the government.â  Tax refunds or credits do not exclusively pertain to illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes as they may be other circumstances where a refund is warranted.  The tax refund provided under Section 229 deals exclusively with illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes but there are other possible situations, such as the refund of excess estimated corporate quarterly income tax paid, or that of excess input tax paid by a VAT-registered person, or that of excise tax paid on goods locally produced or manufactured but actually exported.  The standards and mechanics for the grant of a refund or credit under these situations are different from that under Sec. 229.  Sec. 4[.a)] of R.A. 7432, is yet another instance of a tax credit and it does not in any way refer to illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes,   x x x.ââ
[7]
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
The CA affirmed 
in toto
 the Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ordering petitioner to issue a tax credit certificate in favor of respondent in the reduced amount of P903,038.39.  It reasoned that Republic Act No. (RA) 7432 required neither a tax liability nor a payment of taxes by private establishments prior to the availment of a tax credit.  Moreover, such credit is not tantamount to an unintended benefit from the law, but rather a just compensation for the taking of private property for public use.
Hence this Petition.
[8]
The Issues
Petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:
âWhether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent may claim the 20% sales discount as a tax credit instead of as a deduction from gross income or gross sales.
âWhether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent is entitled to a refund.â
[9]
These two issues may be summed up in only one: whether respondent, despite incurring a net loss, may still claim the 20 percent sales discount as a tax credit.
The Courtâs Ruling
The Petition is not meritorious.
Sole Issue:
Claim of 20 Percent Sales Discount
as Tax Credit Despite Net Loss
Section 4a) of RA 7432
[10]
 grants to senior citizens the privilege of obtaining a 20 percent discount on their purchase of medicine from any private establishment in the country.
[11]
  The latter may then claim the cost of the discount as a 
tax credit
.
[12]
  But can such credit be claimed, even though an establishment operates at a loss?
We answer in the affirmative.
Tax Credit 
versus
Tax Deduction
Although the term is not specifically defined in our Tax Code,
[13]
 
tax credit
 generally refers to an amount that is âsubtracted directly from oneâs total tax liability.â
[14]
  It is an âallowance against the tax itselfâ
[15]
 or âa deduction from what is owedâ
[16]
 by a taxpayer to the government.  Examples of 
tax credits
 are withheld taxes, payments of estimated tax, and investment tax credits.
[17]
Tax credit
 should be understood in relation to other tax concepts.  One of these is 
tax deduction
 -- defined as a subtraction âfrom income for tax purposes,â
[18]
 or an amount that is âallowed by law to reduce income prior to [the] application of the tax rate to compute the amount of tax which is due.â
[19]
  An example of a 
tax deduction
 is any of the allowable deductions enumerated in Section 34
[20]
 of the Tax Code.
A 
tax credit
 differs from a 
tax deduction
.  On the one hand, a 
tax credit
 reduces the tax due, including -- whenever applicable -- the 
income tax
 that is determined after applying the corresponding tax rates to 
taxable income
.
[21]
  A 
tax deduction
, on the other, reduces the income that is subject to tax
[22]
 in order to arrive at 
taxable income
.
[23]
  To think of the former as the latter is to avoid, if not entirely confuse, the issue.  A 
tax credit
 is used only after the tax has been computed; a 
tax deduction
, 
before
.
Tax Liability Required
for Tax Credit
Since a 
tax credit
 is used to reduce directly the tax that is due, there ought to be a tax liability 
before
 the 
tax credit
 can be applied.  Without that liability, any 
tax credit
 application will be useless.  There will be no reason for deducting the latter when there is, to begin with, no existing obligation to the government.  However, as will be presented shortly, the 
existence
 of a tax credit or its 
grant
 by law is not the same as the 
availment
 or 
use
 of such credit.  While the grant is mandatory, the availment or use is not.
If a 
net loss
 is reported by, and no other taxes are currently due from, a business establishment, there will obviously be no tax liability against which any 
tax credit
 can be applied.
[24]
  For the establishment to choose the immediate availment of a 
tax credit
 will be premature and impracticable.  Nevertheless, the irrefutable fact remains that, under RA 7432, Congress has granted without conditions a tax credit benefit to all covered establishments.
Although this 
tax credit
 benefit is available, it need not be used by losing ventures, since there is no tax liability that calls for its application.  Neither can it be reduced to nil by the quick yet callow stroke of an administrative pen, simply because no reduction of taxes can instantly be effected.  By its nature, the 
tax credit
 may still be deducted from a 
future
, not a 
present
, tax liability, without which it does not have any use.  In the meantime, it need not move.  But it breathes.
Prior Tax Payments Not
Required for Tax Credit
While a tax liability is essential to the 
availment or use
 of any 
tax credit
, prior tax payments are not.  On the contrary, for the 
existence or grant
 solely of such credit, neither a tax liability nor a prior tax payment is needed.  The Tax Code is in fact replete with provisions granting or allowing 
tax credits
, even though no taxes have been previously paid.
For example, in computing the 
estate tax due
, Section 86(E) allows a 
tax credit
 -- subject to certain limitations -- for estate taxes paid to a foreign country.  Also found in Section 101(C) is a similar provision for donorâs taxes -- again when paid to a foreign country -- in computing for the 
donorâs tax due
.  The 
tax credits
 in both instances allude to the prior payment of taxes, even if not made to our government.
Under Section 110, a VAT (Value-Added Tax)- registered person engaging in transactions -- whether or not subject to the VAT -- is also allowed a 
tax credit
 that includes a ratable portion of any input tax not directly attributable to either activity.  This input tax may 
either
 be the VAT on the purchase or importation of goods or services that is merely due from -- not necessarily paid by -- such VAT-registered person in the course of trade or business; 
or
 the transitional input tax determined in accordance with Section 111(A).  The latter type may in fact be an amount equivalent to only eight percent of the value of a VAT-registered personâs beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies, when such amount -- as computed -- is higher than the actual VAT paid on the said items.
[25]
  Clearly from this provision, the 
tax credit
 refers to an input tax that is either due only or given a value by mere comparison with the VAT actually paid -- then later prorated.  No tax is actually paid prior to the availment of such credit.
In Section 111(B), a one and a half percent input 
tax credit
 that is merely presumptive is allowed.  For the purchase of primary agricultural products used as inputs --either in the processing of sardines, mackerel and milk, or in the manufacture of refined sugar and cooking oil -- and for the contract price of public work contracts entered into with the government, again, no prior tax payments are needed for the use of the 
tax credit
.
More important, a VAT-registered person whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, under Section 112(A), apply for the issuance of a 
tax credit
 certificate for the amount of creditable input taxes merely due -- again not necessarily paid to -- the government and attributable to such sales, to the extent that the input taxes have not been applied against output taxes.
[26]
  Where a taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales and also in taxable or exempt sales, the amount of creditable input taxes due that are not directly and entirely attributable to any one of these transactions shall be proportionately allocated on the basis of the volume of sales.  Indeed, in availing of such 
tax credit
 for VAT purposes, this provision -- as well as the one earlier mentioned -- shows that the prior payment of taxes is not a requisite.
It may be argued that Section 28(B)(5)(b) of the Tax Code is another illustration of a 
tax credit
 allowed, even though no prior tax payments are not required.  Specifically, in this provision, the imposition of a final withholding tax rate on cash and/or property dividends received by a nonresident foreign corporation from a domestic corporation is subjected to the condition that a foreign 
tax credit
 will be given by the domiciliary country in an amount equivalent to taxes that are merely deemed paid.
[27]
  Although true, this provision actually refers to the 
tax credit
 as a 
condition
 only for the imposition of a lower tax rate, not as a 
deduction
 from the corresponding tax liability.  Besides, it is not our government but the domiciliary country that credits against the income tax payable to the latter by the foreign corporation, the tax to be foregone or spared.
[28]
In contrast, Section 34(C)(3), in relation to Section 34(C)(7)(b), categorically allows as credits, against the income tax imposable under Title II, the amount of income taxes merely incurred -- not necessarily paid -- by a domestic corporation during a taxable year in any foreign country.  Moreover, Section 34(C)(5) provides that for such taxes incurred but not paid, a 
tax credit
 may be allowed, subject to the condition precedent that the taxpayer shall simply give a bond with sureties satisfactory to and approved by petitioner, in such sum as may be required; and further conditioned upon payment by the taxpayer of any tax found due, upon petitionerâs redetermination of it.
In addition to the above-cited provisions in the Tax Code, there are also tax treaties and special laws that grant or allow 
tax credits
, even though no prior tax payments have been made.
Under the treaties in which the 
tax credit
 method is used as a relief to avoid double taxation, income that is taxed in the 
state of source
 is also taxable in the 
state of residence
, but the tax paid in the former is merely allowed as a credit against the tax levied in the latter.
[29]
  Apparently, payment is made to the 
state of source
, not the 
state of residence
.  No tax, therefore, has been 
previously
 paid to the latter.
Under special laws that particularly affect businesses, there can also be 
tax credit
 incentives.  To illustrate, the incentives provided for in Article 48 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1789, as amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 391, include 
tax credits
 equivalent to either five percent of the net value earned, or five or ten percent of the net local content of exports.
[30]
  In order to avail of such credits under the said law and still achieve its objectives, no prior tax payments are necessary.
From all the foregoing instances, it is evident that prior tax payments are not indispensable to the availment of a 
tax credit
.  Thus, the CA correctly held that the availment under RA 7432 did not require prior tax payments by private establishments concerned.
[31]
  However, we do not agree with its finding
[32]
 that the carry-over of 
tax credits
 under the said special law to succeeding taxable periods, and even their application against internal revenue taxes, did not necessitate the existence of a tax liability.
The examples above show that a tax liability is certainly important in the 
availment or use
, not the 
existence or grant
, of a 
tax credit
.  Regarding this matter, a private establishment reporting a 
net loss
 in its financial statements is no different from another that presents a 
net income
.  Both are entitled to the 
tax credit
 provided for under RA 7432, since the law itself accords that unconditional benefit.  However, for the losing establishment to immediately apply such credit, where no tax is due, will be an improvident usance.
Sections 2.i and 4 of Revenue
Regulations No. 2-94 Erroneous
RA 7432 specifically allows private establishments to claim as 
tax credit
 the amount of discounts they grant.
[33]
  In turn, the Implementing Rules and Regulations, issued pursuant thereto, provide the procedures for its availment.
[34]
  To deny such credit, despite the plain mandate of the law and the regulations carrying out that mandate, is indefensible.
First
, the definition given by petitioner is erroneous.  It refers to 
tax credit
 as the amount representing the 20 percent discount that âshall be deducted by the said establishments from their 
gross income
 for income tax purposes and from their 
gross sales
 for value-added tax or other percentage tax purposes.â
[35]
  In ordinary business language, the 
tax credit
 represents the amount of such discount.  However, the manner by which the discount shall be credited against taxes has not been clarified by the revenue regulations.
By ordinary acceptation, a discount is an âabatement or reduction made from the gross amount or value of anything.â
[36]
  To be more precise, it is in business parlance âa deduction or lowering of an amount of money;â
[37]
 or âa reduction from the full amount or value of something, especially a price.â
[38]
  In business there are many kinds of discount, the most common of which is that affecting the 
income statement
[39]
 or financial report upon which the 
income tax
 is based.
Business Discounts
Deducted from Gross Sales
A 
cash discount
, for example, is one granted by business establishments to 
credit customers
 for their prompt payment.
[40]
  It is a âreduction in price offered to the purchaser if payment is made within a shorter period of time than the maximum time specified.â
[41]
  Also referred to as a 
sales discount
 on the part of the seller and a 
purchase discount
 on the part of the buyer, it may be expressed in such terms as â5/10, n/30.â
[42]
A 
quantity discount
, however, is a âreduction in price allowed for purchases made in large quantities, justified by savings in packaging, shipping, and handling.â
[43]
  It is also called a 
volume
 or 
bulk discount
.
[44]
A âpercentage reduction from the list price x x x allowed by manufacturers to wholesalers and by wholesalers to retailersâ
[45]
 is known as a 
trade discount
.  No entry for it need be made in the manual or computerized 
books of accounts
, since the purchase or sale is already valued at the net price actually charged the buyer.
[46]
  The purpose for the discount is to encourage trading or increase sales, and the prices at which the purchased goods may be resold are also suggested.
[47]
  Even a 
chain discount
 -- a series of discounts from one list price -- is recorded at net.
[48]
Finally, akin to a 
trade discount
 is a 
functional discount
.  It is âa supplierâs price discount given to a purchaser based on the [latterâs] role in the [formerâs] distribution system.â
[49]
  This role usually involves warehousing or advertising.
Based on this discussion, we find that the nature of a 
sales discount
 is peculiar.  Applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the country, this type of discount is reflected in the 
income statement
[50]
 as a line item deducted -- along with returns, allowances, rebates and other similar expenses -- from 
gross sales
 to arrive at 
net sales
.
[51]
  This type of presentation is resorted to, because the 
accounts receivable
 and 
sales
 figures that arise from 
sales discounts
, -- as well as from 
quantity, volume
 or 
bulk discounts
 -- are recorded in the manual and computerized 
books of accounts
 and reflected in the financial statements at the gross amounts of the invoices.
[52]
  This manner of recording credit sales -- known as the 
gross method
 -- is most widely used, because it is simple, more convenient to apply than the 
net method
, and produces no material errors over time.
[53]
However, under the 
net method
 used in recording 
trade, chain
 or 
functional discounts
, only the net amounts of the invoices -- after the discounts have been deducted -- are recorded in the 
books of accounts
[54]
 and reflected in the financial statements.  A separate line item cannot be shown,
[55]
 because the transactions themselves involving both 
accounts receivable
 and 
sales
 have already been entered into, net of the said discounts.
The term 
sales discounts
 is not expressly defined in the Tax Code, but one provision adverts to amounts whose sum -- along with 
sales returns, allowances
 and 
cost of goods sold
[56]
 -- is deducted from 
gross sales
 to come up with the 
gross income, profit
 or 
margin
[57]
 derived from business.
[58]
  In another provision therein, 
sales discounts
 that are granted and indicated in the invoices at the time of sale -- and that do not depend upon the happening of any future event -- may be excluded from the 
gross sales
 within the same quarter they were given.
[59]
  While determinative only of the VAT, the latter provision also appears as a suitable reference point for income tax purposes already embraced in the former.  After all, these two provisions affirm that 
sales discounts
 are amounts that are always deductible from 
gross sales
.
Reason for the Senior Citizen Discount:
The Law, Not Prompt Payment
A distinguishing feature of the implementing rules of RA 7432 is the private establishmentâs outright deduction of the discount from the invoice price of the medicine sold to the senior citizen.
[60]
  It is, therefore, expected that for each retail sale made under this law, the discount period lasts no more than a day, because such discount is given -- and the net amount thereof collected -- immediately upon perfection of the sale.
[61]
  Although prompt payment is made for an armâs-length transaction by the senior citizen, the real and compelling reason for the private establishment giving the discount is that the law itself makes it mandatory.
What RA 7432 grants the senior citizen is a mere discount privilege, not a 
sales discount
 or any of the above discounts in particular.  Prompt payment is not the reason for (although a necessary consequence of) such grant.  To be sure, the privilege enjoyed by the senior citizen must be equivalent to the 
tax credit
 benefit enjoyed by the private establishment granting the discount.  Yet, under the revenue regulations promulgated by our tax authorities, this benefit has been erroneously likened and confined to a 
sales discount
.
To a senior citizen, the monetary effect of the privilege may be the same as that resulting from a 
sales discount
.  However, to a private establishment, the effect is different from a simple reduction in price that results from such discount.  In other words, the 
tax credit
 benefit is not the same as a 
sales discount
.  To repeat from our earlier discourse, this benefit cannot and should not be treated as a 
tax deduction
.
To stress, the effect of a 
sales discount
 on the 
income statement
 and 
income tax return
 of an establishment covered by RA 7432 is different from that resulting from the 
availment
 or 
use
 of its 
tax credit
 benefit.  While the former is a deduction 
before
, the latter is a deduction 
after
, the 
income tax
 is computed.  As mentioned earlier, a discount is not necessarily a 
sales discount
, and a 
tax credit
 for a simple discount privilege should not be automatically treated like a 
sales discount
.  
Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus
.  Where the law does not distinguish, we ought not to distinguish.
Sections 2.i and 4 of Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 2-94 define 
tax credit
 as the 20 percent discount deductible from 
gross income
 for 
income tax
 purposes, or from 
gross sales
 for VAT or other percentage tax purposes.  In effect, the 
tax credit
 benefit under RA 7432 is related to a 
sales discount
.  This contrived definition is improper, considering that the latter has to be deducted from 
gross sales
 in order to compute the 
gross income
 in the 
income statement
 and cannot be deducted again, even for purposes of computing the 
income tax
.
When the law says that the cost of the discount may be claimed as a 
tax credit
, it means that the amount -- when claimed -- shall be treated as a reduction from any tax liability, plain and simple.  The option to avail of the 
tax credit
 benefit depends upon the existence of a tax liability, but to limit the benefit to a 
sales discount
 -- which is not even identical to the discount privilege that is granted by law -- does not define it at all and serves no useful purpose.  The definition must, therefore, be stricken down.
Laws Not Amended
by Regulations
Second
, the law cannot be amended by a mere regulation.  In fact, a regulation that âoperates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute is a mere nullityâ;
[62]
 it cannot prevail.
It is a cardinal rule that courts âwill and should respect the contemporaneous construction placed upon a statute by the executive officers whose duty it is to enforce it x x x.â
[63]
  In the scheme of judicial tax administration, the need for certainty and predictability in the implementation of tax laws is crucial.
[64]
  Our tax authorities fill in the details that âCongress may not have the opportunity or competence to provide.â
[65]
  The regulations these authorities issue are relied upon by taxpayers, who are certain that these will be followed by the courts.
[66]
  Courts, however, will not uphold these authoritiesâ interpretations when clearly absurd, erroneous or improper.
In the present case, the tax authorities have given the term tax credit in Sections 2.i and 4 of RR 2-94 a meaning utterly in contrast to what RA 7432 provides.  Their interpretation has muddled up the intent of Congress in granting a mere discount privilege, not a sales discount.  The administrative agency issuing these regulations may not enlarge, alter or restrict the provisions of the law it administers; it cannot engraft additional requirements not contemplated by the legislature.
[67]
In case of conflict, the law must prevail.
[68]
  A âregulation adopted pursuant to law is law.â
[69]
  Conversely, a regulation or any portion thereof not adopted pursuant to law is no law and has neither the force nor the effect of law.
[70]
Availment of Tax
Credit Voluntary
Third
, the word 
may
 in the text of the statute
[71]
 implies that the availability of the 
tax credit
 benefit is neither unrestricted nor mandatory.
[72]
  There is no absolute right conferred upon respondent, or any similar taxpayer, to avail itself of the 
tax credit
 remedy whenever it chooses; âneither does it impose a duty on the part of the government to sit back and allow an important facet of tax collection to be at the sole control and discretion of the taxpayer.â
[73]
  For the tax authorities to compel respondent to deduct the 20 percent discount from either its 
gross income
 or its 
gross sales
[74]
 is, therefore, not only to make an imposition without basis in law, but also to blatantly contravene the law itself.
What Section 4.a of RA 7432 means is that the 
tax credit
 benefit is merely permissive, not imperative.  Respondent is given two options -- either to claim or not to claim the cost of the discounts as a 
tax credit
.  In fact, it may even ignore the credit and simply consider the gesture as an act of beneficence, an expression of its social conscience.
Granting that there is a tax liability and respondent claims such cost as a 
tax credit
, then the 
tax credit
 can easily be applied.  If there is none, the credit cannot be used and will just have to be carried over and revalidated
[75]
 accordingly.  If, however, the business continues to operate at a loss and no other taxes are due, thus compelling it to close shop, the credit can never be applied and will be lost altogether.
In other words, it is the existence or the lack of a tax liability that determines whether the cost of the discounts can be used as a 
tax credit
.  RA 7432 does not give respondent the unfettered right to avail itself of the credit whenever it pleases.  Neither does it allow our tax administrators to expand or contract the legislative mandate.  âThe âplain meaning ruleâ or 
verba legis
 in statutory construction is thus applicable x x x.  Where the words of a statute are clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation.â
[76]
Tax Credit 
Benefit
Deemed
 Just Compensation
Fourth
, Sections 2.i and 4 of RR 2-94 deny the exercise by the State of its power of eminent domain.  Be it stressed that the privilege enjoyed by senior citizens does not come 
directly
 from the State, but rather from the private establishments concerned.  Accordingly, the 
tax credit
 benefit granted to these establishments can be deemed as their 
just compensation
 for private property taken by the State for public use.
[77]
The concept of 
public use
 is no longer confined to the traditional notion of 
use by the public
, but held synonymous with 
public interest, public benefit, public welfare
, and 
public convenience
.
[78]
  The discount privilege to which our senior citizens are entitled is actually a benefit enjoyed by the general public to which these citizens belong.  The discounts given would have entered the coffers and formed part of the gross sales of the private establishments concerned, were it not for RA 7432.  The permanent reduction in their total revenues is a forced subsidy corresponding to the taking of private property for 
public use or benefit
.
As a result of the 20 percent discount imposed by RA 7432, respondent becomes entitled to a 
just compensation
.  This term refers not only to the issuance of a 
tax credit
 certificate indicating the correct amount of the discounts given, but also to the promptness in its release.  Equivalent to the payment of property taken by the State, such issuance -- when not done within a 
reasonable time
 from the grant of the discounts -- cannot be considered as 
just compensation
.  In effect, respondent is made to suffer the consequences of being immediately deprived of its revenues while awaiting actual receipt, through the certificate, of the equivalent amount it needs to cope with the reduction in its revenues.
[79]
Besides, the taxation power can also be used as an implement for the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
[80]
  Tax measures are but âenforced contributions exacted on pain of penal sanctionsâ
[81]
 and âclearly imposed for a 
public purpose
.â
[82]
  In recent years, the power to tax has indeed become a most effective tool to realize social justice, 
public welfare
, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
[83]
While it is a declared commitment under Section 1 of RA 7432, social justice âcannot be invoked to trample on the rights of property owners who under our Constitution and laws are also entitled to protection. The social justice consecrated in our [C]onstitution [is] not intended to take away rights from a person and give them to another who is not entitled thereto.â
[84]
  For this reason, a just compensation for income that is taken away from respondent becomes necessary.  It is in the 
tax credit
 that our legislators find support to realize social justice, and no administrative body can alter that fact.
To put it differently, a private establishment that merely breaks even
[85]
 --without the discounts yet -- will surely start to incur losses because of such discounts.  The same effect is expected if its mark-up is less than 20 percent, and if all its sales come from retail purchases by senior citizens.  Aside from the observation we have already raised earlier, it will also be grossly unfair to an establishment if the discounts will be treated merely as deductions from either its 
gross income
 or its 
gross sales
.  Operating at a loss through no fault of its own, it will realize that the 
tax credit
 limitation under RR 2-94 is inutile, if not improper.  Worse, profit-generating businesses will be put in a better position if they avail themselves of 
tax credits
 denied those that are losing, because no taxes are due from the latter.
Grant of
 Tax Credit
Intended by the Legislature
Fifth
, RA 7432 itself seeks to adopt measures whereby senior citizens are assisted by the community as a whole and to establish a program beneficial to them.
[86]
  These objectives are consonant with the constitutional policy of making âhealth x x x services available to all the people at affordable costâ
[87]
 and of giving âpriority for the needs of the x x x elderly.â
[88]
  Sections 2.i and 4 of RR 2-94, however, contradict these constitutional policies and statutory objectives.
Furthermore, Congress has allowed all private establishments a simple 
tax credit
, not a deduction.  In fact, no cash outlay is required from the government for the 
availment
 or 
use
 of such credit.  The deliberations on February 5, 1992 of the Bicameral Conference Committee Meeting on Social Justice, which finalized RA 7432, disclose the true intent of our legislators to treat the 
sales discounts
 as a 
tax credit
, rather than as a deduction from 
gross income
.  We quote from those deliberations as follows:
"THE CHAIRMAN (Rep. Unico).  By the way, before that ano, about deductions from taxable income. I think we incorporated there a provision na - on the responsibility of the private hospitals and drugstores, hindi ba?
SEN. ANGARA.  Oo.
THE CHAIRMAN.  (Rep. Unico), So, I think we have to put in also a provision here about the deductions from taxable income of that private hospitals, di ba ganon 'yan?
MS. ADVENTO.  Kaya lang po sir, and mga discounts po nila affecting government and public institutions, so, puwede na po nating hindi isama yung mga less deductions ng taxable income.
THE CHAIRMAN.  (Rep. Unico). Puwede na. Yung about the private hospitals. Yung isiningit natin?
MS. ADVENTO.  Singit na po ba yung 15% on credit. (inaudible/did not use the microphone).
SEN. ANGARA.  Hindi pa, hindi pa.
THE CHAIRMAN.  (Rep. Unico) Ah, 'di pa ba naisama natin?
SEN. ANGARA.  Oo. You want to insert that?
THE CHAIRMAN (Rep. Unico).  Yung ang proposal ni Senator Shahani, e.
SEN. ANGARA.  In the case of private hospitals they got the grant of 15% discount, provided that, the private hospitals can claim the expense as a tax credit.
REP. AQUINO.  Yah could be allowed as deductions in the perpetrations of (inaudible) income.
SEN. ANGARA.  I-tax credit na lang natin para walang cash-out ano?
REP. AQUINO.  Oo, tax credit. Tama, Okay. Hospitals ba o lahat ng establishments na covered.
THE CHAIRMAN. (Rep. Unico).  Sa kuwan lang yon, as private hospitals lang.
REP. AQUINO.  Ano ba yung establishments na covered?
SEN. ANGARA.  Restaurant lodging houses, recreation centers.
REP. AQUINO.  All establishments covered siguro?
SEN. ANGARA.  From all establishments. Alisin na natin 'Yung kuwan kung ganon. Can we go back to Section 4 ha?
REP. AQUINO.  Oho.
SEN. ANGARA.  Letter A. To capture that thought, we'll say the grant of 20% discount from all establishments et cetera, et cetera, provided that said establishments - provided that private establishments may claim the cost as a tax credit. Ganon ba 'yon?
REP. AQUINO.  Yah.
SEN. ANGARA.  Dahil kung government, they don't need to claim it.
THE CHAIRMAN. (Rep. Unico).  Tax credit.
SEN. ANGARA.  
As a tax credit [rather] than a kuwan - deduction
, Okay.
REP. AQUINO  Okay.
SEN. ANGARA.  Sige Okay. Di subject to style na lang sa Letter A".
[89]
Special Law
Over General Law
Sixth and last
, RA 7432 is a special law that should prevail over the Tax Code -- a general law.  âx x x [T]he rule is that on a specific matter the special law shall prevail over the general law, which shall be resorted to only to supply deficiencies in the former.â
[90]
  In addition, â[w]here there are two statutes, the earlier special and the later general -- the terms of the general broad enough to include the matter provided for in the special -- the fact that one is special and the other is general creates a presumption that the special is to be considered as remaining an exception to the general,
[91]
 one as a general law of the land, the other as the law of a particular case.â
[92]
  âIt is a canon of statutory construction that a later 
statute, general in its terms
 and not expressly repealing a 
prior special
 statute, will ordinarily not affect the special provisions of such earlier statute.â
[93]
RA 7432 is an earlier law not expressly repealed by, and therefore remains an exception to, the Tax Code -- a later law.  When the former states that a 
tax credit
 may be claimed, then the requirement of prior tax payments under certain provisions of the latter, as discussed above, cannot be made to apply.  Neither can the instances of or references to a 
tax deduction
 under the Tax Code
[94]
 be made to restrict RA 7432.  No provision of any revenue regulation can supplant or modify the acts of Congress.
WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby 
DENIED

âWhile 
taxable income
 is based on the method of accounting used by the taxpayer, it will almost always differ from 
accounting income
.  This is so because of a fundamental difference in the ends the two concepts serve.  Accounting attempts to 
match
 cost against revenue.  Tax law is aimed at 
collecting 
revenue.  It is quick to treat an item as income, slow to recognize deductions or losses.  Thus, the tax law will 
not
 recognize deductions for 
contingent future losses
 except in very limited situations.  Good accounting, on the other hand, 
requires
 their recognition.  Once this fundamental difference in approach is accepted, 
income tax
 accounting methods can be understood more easily.â

Functional
, as opposed to the 
natural

income statement
.  
Functional
 presentation classifies expenses according to their function -- whether as part of 
cost of sales
, selling activities, administrative activities, or other operating activities.  The Accounting Standards Council (ASC) in the Philippines does not prescribe any format, the choice being based on that which âfairly presents the elements of the enterprise performance.â  If the 
functional
 format is used, an additional disclosure of the nature of the expenses is necessary.  Valix and Peralta, supra, pp. 155 & 162.

 Cost of goods sold
 is the most commonly used term referring to a particular section in the financial statements, reports, or notes to financial statements of trading or merchandising concerns.  For a manufacturing business, however, the term used is 
cost of goods manufactured and sold 
or
 cost of goods produced and sold
; for a service enterprise, 
cost of services
; and, in general, 
cost of sales
 of a business.

Gross income, profit or margin

 Theoretically, an 
allowance for sales discount 
account can also be set up by a business establishment in its books of account at the end of its accounting period to reflect its estimates of cash discounts on open accounts based on past experience.  The accounting entry for this account is then reversed at the beginning of the next accounting period, so that such discounts can again be normally charged to the 
sales discount
 account.  Valix and Peralta, supra, p. 348.
