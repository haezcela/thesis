ROBERT Z. BARBERS, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, NATIONAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS FOR SENATORS AND PARTY-LIST REPRESENTATIVES, AND RODOLFO G. BIAZON, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




CARPIO, J.:


The Case
This is a petition for certiorari
[1]

 and prohibition with prayer for temporary restraining order and 
preliminary injunction to nullify the Resolution dated 6 July 2004 of 
the Special Division of the Commission on Elections (âCOMELECâ),
[2]
as well as the Resolution dated 25 October 2004 of the COMELEC 
en banc
.
[3]
  The Resolutions affirmed the proclamation of the COMELEC sitting
 en banc 
as
 the National Board of Canvassers (âNBCâ) declaring Rodolfo G. Biazon 
(âBiazonâ) as the duly elected 12th Senator in the 10 May 2004 National 
and Local Elections.
The Facts
Robert
 Z. Barbers (âBarbersâ) and Biazon were candidates for re-election to 
the Senate of the Philippines in the 10 May 2004 Synchronized National 
and Local Elections (âelectionsâ).
On 24 May 2004, the COMELEC sitting 
en banc

 as the NBC for the election of Senators promulgated Resolution No. NBC 
04-002 proclaiming the first 11 duly elected Senators in the elections. 
 The COMELEC as the NBC promulgated the Resolution based on the 
Certificates of Canvass (âCOCsâ) submitted by the following: (a) 78 
Provincial Boards of Canvassers; (b) 7 City Boards of Canvassers of 
cities comprising one or more legislative districts; (c) 13 City Board 
of Canvassers from the National Capital Region; (d) 2 District Boards of
 Canvassers from  Metro Manila; (e) 74 Special Boards of Canvassers for 
Overseas Absentee Voting; and (f) 1 Board of Canvassers for Local 
Absentee Voting.  The COMELEC declared that it would proclaim the 
remaining 12th winning candidate for Senator after canvassing the 
remaining unsubmitted COCs.
[4]
On 2 June 2004, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. NBC 04-005 proclaiming Biazon as âthe 12
th

 ranking duly elected 12th Senator of the Republic of the Philippines in
 the May 10, 2004 national and local elections, to serve for a term of 6
 years, beginning on June 30, 2004 in accordance with Article VI, 
Section IV of the Constitution of the Philippines.â The COMELEC stated 
that after the canvass of the supplemental Provincial COCs from 
Maguindanao (Cotabato City), Lanao del Sur and one barangay in Nueva 
Vizcaya, Biazon obtained 10,635,270 votes nationwide.  On the other 
hand, Barbers obtained 10,624,585 votes.  Thus, Biazon obtained 10,685 
more votes than Barbers.  The COMELEC stated that this âdifference will 
not materially be affected by the votes in certain precincts where there
 was failure of elections.â
[5]
Claiming
 that Biazonâs proclamation was void, Barbers filed a petition to annul 
the proclamation of Biazon as Senator of the Republic of the Philippines
 with the COMELEC on 7 June 2004.  The petition, docketed as SPC Case 
No. 04-258, was assigned to a Special Division of the COMELEC.
[6]
In
 his petition, Barbers asserted that the proclamation of Biazon was 
âillegal and premature being based on an incomplete canvass.â Barbers 
asserted that the remaining uncanvassed COCs and votes and the results 
of the    special elections, which were still to be conducted, would 
undoubtedly affect the results of the elections.
[7]
In
 his Comment/Answer, Biazon asserted that: (1) the First Division of the
 COMELEC has no jurisdiction to review, modify, or set aside    what the
 COMELEC sitting en banc as the NBC for Senators has officially 
performed, which is the promulgation of Resolution No. NBC 04-005; (2) 
since the COMELEC has proclaimed Biazon on 2 June 2004 in Resolution No.
 NBC 04-005 as the duly elected 12
th
 Senator and Biazon has 
taken his oath of office on 30 June 2004, the Senate Electoral Tribunal,
 not the COMELEC, has jurisdiction to entertain the present petition; 
(3) with Biazonâs admitted and established margin of 10,685 votes, the 
votes from the alleged uncanvassed COCs and the votes still to be cast 
in the special elections which were still to be conducted would not 
substantially affect the results of the election for the 12th and last 
slot for Senator; and (4) the NBC committed a manifest error in 
crediting to Barbers a total of 34,711 votes from the province of Lanao 
del Sur while crediting to Biazon only 1,428 votes from the supplemental
 Provincial COCs for Lanao del Sur despite the existence and 
availability of the Municipal COCs for Balabagan and Tagoloan, Lanao del
 Sur.
[8]
On 9 June 
2004, Barbers filed an Omnibus Motion for Immediate Service of Summons, 
for Suspension of the Effects of Proclamation, and to Set Case for 
Hearing.  Barbers asserted that an immediate resolution of the present 
case was necessary because the term of office of Senators would commence
 on 30 June 2004.  Barbers further claimed that there were Municipal 
COCs still to be included in the senatorial canvass and special 
elections still to be held in certain municipalities involving a total 
of 29,219 votes. Thus, Barbers insisted that âsuspension of the effects 
of the proclamationâ of Biazon was necessary.  Barbers stressed that 
there could be no valid proclamation based on an incomplete canvass.
[9]
On 6 July 2004, the COMELEC issued the first assailed Resolution, disposing as follows:
WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the Commission (Special Division) hereby DENIES 
the petition to annul the proclamation of respondent RODOLFO G. BIAZON 
for LACK OF MERIT.
ACCORDINGLY, the Special Division RESTATES the proclamation of the Commission on Elections sitting 
en banc
 as the National Board of Canvassers declaring RODOLFO G. BIAZON as the duly elected 12
th
 Senator of the Republic of Philippines in the May 10, 2004 National and Local Elections.
SO ORDERED.
[10]
Barbers filed a motion for reconsideration
[11]
 which the COMELEC en banc denied in the second assailed 25 October 2004 Resolution.
The COMELECâs Ruling
In its 6 July 2004 Resolution, the COMELEC (Special Division) denied Barbersâ petition, thus:
The
 instant petition is not a pre-proclamation case as the issues raised 
herein clearly are not among those enumerated under Section 34 of 
COMELEC Resolution No. 6669.  Neither is it a protest case because the 
ground cited in the petition is not proper for protest although a 
proclamation has already been made.  It is a petition, as entitled, to 
annul proclamation based on alleged incomplete canvass.
The power
 to annul proclamation is an exclusive power of the Commission vested 
upon it by the Constitution, which states that the Commission shall 
exercise the power to â
Decide except those involving the right to vote, all questions affecting elections xxx
â (Article IX-C, Section 2 (3).
As
 held in the Case of Aguam vs. COMELEC, the COMELEC shall have exclusive
 charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws relative to 
the conduct of elections and shall exercise all other functions which 
may be conferred upon it by law.  The Constitution enjoins the COMELEC 
to decide, saving those involving the right to vote, all administrative 
questions, affecting elections.  Corollary thereto, the court has given 
its imprimatur on the principle that COMELEC is with authority to annul 
any canvass and proclamation illegally made.
Records reveal that 
on June 2, 2004, the National Board of Canvassers (NBC), on the basis of
 the Certificates of Canvass submitted by seventy-eight (78) Provincial 
Board of Canvassers; seven (7) City Boards of Canvassers of cities 
comprising one or more legislative districts; thirteen (13) from the 
National Capital Region (NCR); two (2) from the District Boards of 
Canvassers of Metro Manila; seventy-four (74) from the Special Board of 
Canvassers for Overseas Absentee Voting; and one (1) from the Board of 
Canvassers for Local Absentee Voting, including the supplemental 
Provincial Certificates of Canvass from Maguindanao (Cotabato City), 
Lanao del Sur and Nueva Vizcaya (one barangay), declared that private 
respondent obtained ten million six hundred thirty-five thousand two 
hundred seventy (10,635,270) votes as against the ten million six 
hundred twenty-four thousand five hundred eighty-five (10,624,585) votes
 garnered by petitioner.
On the basis of the number of votes 
garnered by private respondent, he was proclaimed on June 2, 2004 as the
 duly elected Senator in the recently concluded May 10, 2004 National 
and Local Elections.
However, after his proclamation, the 
Commission received Certificates of Canvass from the aforementioned 
provinces.  The results of the votes for petitioner and private 
respondent, showed the following figures, to wit:

Although
 special elections in Tinglayan, Kalinga were conducted on June 7, 2004,
 no voters voted, thus, there was no COC to canvass.
On the other hand, special elections for the remaining places are yet to be conducted, namely:
1. Lanao del Sur
 
 
    a. Bayang
259 votes
(3 precincts)
    b. Balabagan

    a.  Silvino Lobos

(8 precincts)

From the foregoing data, petitioner and private respondent should be credited with the following number of votes, to wit:

BARBERS 
10,624,585
6,736
10,631,321
From
 the above summation, the lead of private respondent over petitioner 
undoubtedly was reduced to six thousand two hundred twelve (6,212).  
Assuming that the remaining uncanvassed votes of two thousand nine 
hundred thirty-one (2,931) in places where special elections are yet to 
be held were all votes in favor of petitioner Barbers, nevertheless, 
this will not materially affect the results of the election.  To say the
 least, even if private respondentâs lead was decreased to three 
thousand two hundred ninety-nine (3,299) votes, he remains to be the 
winner and therefore the lawful occupant of the 12th slot for the 
senatorial position.
[12]
In its 25 October 2004 Resolution, the COMELEC en banc denied Barbersâ motion for reconsideration, thus:
We
 maintain Our declaration and findings as established by the Special 
Division.  After a judicious and thorough scrutiny of the records, We 
are more than convinced that respondentâs proclamation was indeed, valid
 and operative.  In the questioned resolution issued by the Special 
Division, We based our ruling on the official Comelec records, revealing
 that respondentâs lead over petitioner was insurmountable regardless of
 the results from the delayed certificates of canvass and from the 
uncanvassed votes for the special elections.  This ratiocination was 
very well explained in the assailed resolution and need not be 
reiterated herein.  Unfortunately for petitioner, he failed in this 
motion to adduce evidence sufficient to overturn Our ruling and justify 
the prayer for reliefs.
It must be noted that, in a pleading, 
petitioner has raised the Report/Recommendation of the Supervisory 
Committee to buttress his claim that, indeed, there was incomplete 
canvass.  Petitioner is invited to examine the said report closer, for 
the same shows the extent of irregularities that transpired in the 
subject towns and provinces such as Columbio, Sultan Kudarat, and 
Talitay, Maguindanao, rendering the 
supplemental
 provincial certificates of canvass dubious at the very least.
For the town of Columbio, the Committee reported that:
â¦ 
 Records with the ERSD show that the MCOC and corresponding SOV dated 
June 18 and 17, 2004, respectively, for the twenty-one (21) precincts 
used as basis for the 
supplemental PCOC

 are unsigned by the chairman of the municipal board of canvassers, but 
signed by the two other members.  Please note that the two other members
 of the MBC who signed the SOV and MCOC used as basis of the 
supplemental PCOC are the members of the Pangamadun board all of whom 
were r
eplaced by the Radam board as early as May 20, 2004
.  (emphasis supplied)
On the other hand, the Committee noted that for the town of Talitay, thus:
Atty.
 Wyne Asdala, Chairman of the Provincial Board of Canvassers for the 
Province of Maguindanao then submitted a supplemental provincial 
certificate of canvass dated June 16, 2004 containing the results from 
the municipalities of South Upi and Talitay.  Per SOV attached to the 
supplemental PCOC, Barbers obtained 4,472 votes and Biazon, 455 votes 
for the municipality of Talitay.  
Records do not show which MCOC was used as basis by the Asdala board for the preparation of the supplemental PCOC
.  (emphasis supplied)
And
 by exercising its prerogative and discretion, the Commission duly noted
 the said Committeeâs recommendation to âuse only the MCOCs prepared by 
the duly constituted municipal boards of canvassers as basis for the 
provincial canvass in Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao.â
At any 
rate, We likewise confirm the opinion of Commissioner Florentino A. 
Tuason, Jr., on the nature and ramifications of herein SPC Case for 
Annulment of Proclamation.
Citing the case of Rasul vs. Comelec, 
the Honorable Supreme Court declared that â In Pangilinan vs. Commission
 on Elections, this Court has ruled that âwhere the candidate has 
already been proclaimed winner in the congressional elections, the 
remedy of petitioner is to file an electoral protest with the Electoral 
Tribunal of the House of Representatives.â  In like manner, where as in 
this case, petitioner assails the Commissionâs resolution proclaiming 
the twelfth (12th) winning senatorial candidate, petitionerâs proper 
recourse was to file a regular election protest which under the 
Constitution and the Omnibus Election Code exclusively pertains to the 
Senate Electoral Tribunal.
Under the Omnibus Election Code (OEC),
 following the clear enunciation of Section 242 and the immediately 
succeeding sections, it is clear that annulment of proclamation, be it 
partial or total, arises from the Commissionâs jurisdiction over 
pre-proclamation controversies.  Republic Act (RA) No. 7166, qualifies 
such power of the Commission by so stating that a pre-proclamation 
contest may only apply in cases where there are âmanifest errorsâ in the
 election returns or certificates of canvass, with respect to national 
elective positions such as herein case.
To prove that the same is
 manifest, the errors must appear on the certificates of canvass or 
election returns sought to be corrected and/or objections thereto must 
have been made before the board of canvassers and specifically noted in 
the minutes of their administrative proceedings.  (Chavez vs. Comelec, 
GR No. 150799, 03 February 2004)
Parties, therefore, ought to be 
careful in availing themselves of remedies lest they fall into a trap of
 their own making â one that they cannot escape from.
Nevertheless, granting 
arguendo

 that the present case is not a pre-proclamation case, as so 
painstakingly pointed out by petitioner, but one that is due to an 
incomplete canvass, and the relief sought emanates from the plenary 
power of the Commission, herein petitioner, sadly, failed to present 
convincing and legitimate evidence in support of his petition (including
 this motion for reconsideration).
[13]
Hence, this petition.
The Issues
Barbers raises the following issues for resolution:
Whether
 or not public respondent COMELEC gravely abused its discretion, 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it deliberately 
insisted in resorting to and in using and considering, for purposes of 
tallying/tabulation of the still uncanvassed election results, MERE 
improvised Municipal COCs, which are NON-CANVASSED election documents, 
unauthentic, unreliable and dubious on their faces which documents were 
submitted, not to the NBC, but to a mere Comelec Department [ERSD]; 
instead of availing and relying on official CANVASS documents â 
PROVINCIAL COCs submitted to COMELEC, as the National Board of 
Canvassers for Senators.
Whether or not the public respondent 
COMELEC gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of 
jurisdiction when it first correctly recognized the undisputed fact that
 there was an INCOMPLETE CANVASS at the time that respondent Biazon was 
initially "proclaimedâ PREMATURELY on June 2, 2004, but adamantly 
refused to rectify its VOID premature proclamation when it opted to 
reinstate the said sham proclamation of respondent Biazon, by 
anomalously resorting to and relying on, unauthentic, dubious and 
non-canvassed documents [Municipal COCs], rather than on the legal and 
lawful canvassed documents [PROVINCIAL COCs].
[14]
The Courtâs Ruling
The petition must fail.
To our mind, the basic issue for resolution is whether this Court can take cognizance of this petition.
Certiorari
 as a special civil action is available only if there is concurrence of 
the essential requisites, to wit:  (a) the tribunal, board or officer 
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in 
excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to 
lack of jurisdiction, and (b) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy 
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to annul or modify the
 proceeding.  There must be capricious, arbitrary and whimsical exercise
 of power for certiorari to prosper.
[15]
On
 the other hand, prohibition as a special civil action is available only
 if the following essential requisites concur:  (a) the proceedings of 
the tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person exercising judicial,
 quasi-judicial or ministerial functions are without or in excess of its
 or his jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
 or excess of jurisdiction, and (b) there is no appeal or any other 
plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to 
compel the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action.
[16]
Article VI, Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution provides:
Sec. 17.  The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the 
sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications

 of their respective Members.  Each Electoral Tribunal shall be composed
 of nine Members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court 
to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be 
Members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may 
be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from
 the political parties and the parties or organization registered under 
the party-list system represented therein.  The senior Justice in the 
Electoral Tribunal shall be its Chairman.  (Emphasis and underscoring 
supplied)
Rule 12 of the Revised Rules of the Senate Electoral Tribunal provides:
RULE 12. Jurisdiction. â The Senate Electoral Tribunal is the 
sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the Members of the Senate
. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
In 
Pangilinan v. Commission on Elections
,
[17]
 we ruled that:
The
 Senate and the House of Representatives now have their respective 
Electoral Tribunals which are the âsole judge of all contests relating 
to the election, returns, and qualifications of their respective 
Members,â thereby divesting the Commission on Elections of its 
jurisdiction under the 1973 Constitution over election cases pertaining 
to the election of the Members of the Batasang Pambansa (Congress).
In 
Javier v. COMELEC
,
[18]
 we interpreted the phrase âelection, returns and qualificationsâ as follows:
The
 phrase âelection, returns and qualificationsâ should be interpreted in 
its totality as referring to all matters affecting the validity of the 
contesteeâs title.  But if it is necessary to specify, we can say that 
âelectionâ referred to the conduct of the polls, including the listing 
of voters, the holding of the electoral campaign, and the casting and 
counting of the votes; 
âreturnsâ to the
 canvass of the returns and the proclamation of the winners, including 
questions concerning the composition of the board of canvassers and the 
authenticity of the election returns
; and âqualificationsâ to matters that could be raised in a 
quo warranto

 proceeding against the proclaimed winner, such as his disloyalty or 
ineligibility or the inadequacy of his certificate of candidacy.  
(Emphasis supplied)
The word âsoleâ in Section 17, 
Article VI of the 1987 Constitution and Rule 12 of the Revised Rules of 
the Senate Electoral Tribunal (âSETâ) underscores the exclusivity of the
 SETâs jurisdiction over election contests relating to members of the 
Senate.  The authority conferred upon the SET is categorical and 
complete.  It is therefore clear that this Court has no jurisdiction to 
entertain the instant petition.
[19]
 
 Since Barbers contests Biazonâs proclamation as the 12th winning 
senatorial candidate, it is the SET which has exclusive jurisdiction to 
act on Barbersâ complaint.
[20]
In 
Pangilinan
,
[21]

 we ruled that âwhere the candidate has already been proclaimed winner 
in the congressional elections, the remedy of petitioner is to file an 
electoral protest with the Electoral Tribunal of the House of 
Representatives.â
[22]
  In like
 manner, where as in the present case, Barbers assails Biazonâs 
proclamation as the 12th duly elected Senator, Barbersâ proper recourse 
is to file a regular election protest with the SET.
[23]
Certiorari
 and prohibition will not lie in this case considering that there is an 
available and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to annul the
 COMELECâs assailed proceedings.  We take pains to emphasize that after 
the proclamation, Barbers should have filed an electoral protest before 
the SET.
While the resolution of the issues presented in this 
petition falls within the sole jurisdiction of the SET, still we opt to 
discuss them to show the absence of grave abuse of discretion on the 
part of COMELEC.
Barbers claims that Biazonâs 2 June 2004 
proclamation as the 12th winning senatorial candidate is a nullity 
because it was based on an incomplete canvass.  Barbers asserts that the
 COMELECâs act of making such premature proclamation constituted grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  
Barbers also claims that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion when,
 after having used Provincial Certificates of Canvass (âPCOCsâ) in the 
canvass of election results for Senators up to 2 June 2004, the COMELEC 
used the Municipal Certificates of Canvass (âMCOCsâ) in the âfinal 
tabulation of the uncanvassed results and that of the special elections 
yet to be held in certain parts of the country.â
[24]
Barbersâ arguments are specious.
An
 incomplete canvass of votes is illegal and cannot be the basis of a 
subsequent proclamation.  A canvass is not reflective of the true vote 
of the electorate unless the board of canvassers considers all returns 
and omits none.  However, this is true only where the election returns 
missing or not counted will affect the results of the election.
[25]
The
 COMELEC, in promulgating its 2 June 2004 Resolution No. NBC 04-005 
proclaiming Biazon as the 12th duly elected Senator, observed the 
following provisions of the Omnibus Election Code:
SEC. 233.  
When the election returns are delayed, lost or destroyed.

 â In case its copy of the election returns is missing, the board of 
canvassers shall, by messenger or otherwise, obtain such missing 
election returns from the board of election inspectors concerned, or if 
said returns have been lost or destroyed, the board of canvassers, upon 
prior authority of the Commission, may use any of the authentic copies 
of said election returns or certified copy of said election returns 
issued by the Commission, and forthwith direct its representative to 
investigate the case and immediately report the matter to the 
Commission.
The
 board of canvassers, notwithstanding the fact that not all the election
 returns have been received by it, may terminate the canvass and 
proclaim the candidates elected on the basis of the available election 
returns if the missing election returns will not affect the results of 
the election.
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
On
 5 May 2004, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 6749, i.e., âGeneral
 Instructions for the Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of the Results 
for Senators and Party List in the May 10, 2004 National and Local 
Elections.â  Section 9 of the Resolution provides:
SEC. 9. 
Proclamation of results.

 â Upon completion of the canvass, the Supervisory Committee and the 
watchers if available shall certify the final printout of results as 
canvassed.  On the basis of the certified final printout, the NBC shall 
cause the preparation of, sign and approve the Certificate of Canvass 
and Proclamation, and proclaim the winning candidates for senators, 
certify the results of the election of the party-list system and 
proclaim the nominees of the parties which obtained the required 
percentage of votes.
Notwithstanding
 the fact that not all of the COCs have been received or canvassed, the 
NBC may terminate the canvass if the missing COCs would no longer affect
 the results of the elections.
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
In
 the present case, the report which the COMELEC Supervisory Committee 
submitted on 29 June 2004 shows that Barbers obtained 6,736 votes in 
areas where results were not included in the national canvass.  As for 
Biazon, he garnered 2,263 votes.
[26]
  Also, the Supervisory Committeeâs report shows that 
the
 total number of registered voters in areas where special elections were
 still to be conducted was only 2,931, covering only 19 precincts in 
three municipalities.
[27]
As correctly stated by the COMELEC:
From
 the above summation, the lead of private respondent over petitioner 
undoubtedly was reduced to six thousand two hundred twelve (6,212).  
Assuming that the remaining uncanvassed votes of two thousand nine 
hundred thirty-one (2,931) in places where special elections are yet to 
be held were all votes in favor of petitioner Barbers, nevertheless, 
this will not materially affect the results of the election.  To say the
 least, even if private respondentâs lead was decreased to three 
thousand two hundred ninety-nine (3,299) votes, he remains to be the 
winner and therefore the lawful occupant of the 12th slot for the 
senatorial position.
[28]
It
 suffices to say that the COMELEC based its ruling in the assailed 
Resolutions on official COMELEC records.  The COMELEC enjoys the 
presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of official 
duty.
[29]
Since the election returns not included in the national canvass as well as the results of the special elections to be held 
would not materially affect the results of the elections
, it is immaterial whether the COMELEC used PCOCs or MCOCs in the subsequent canvass.
The
 alleged invalidity of Biazonâs proclamation involves a dispute or 
contest relating to the election returns of members of the Senate.  
Indisputably, the resolution of such dispute falls within the sole 
jurisdiction of the SET.  For this Court to take cognizance of the 
electoral protest against Biazon would usurp the constitutional 
functions of the SET.  In addition, the COMELEC did not commit any grave
 abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Resolutions affirming 
Biazonâs proclamation since the uncanvassed returns and the results of 
the special elections to be held would not materially affect the results
 of the elections.
WHEREFORE,
 we
 DISMISS
 the instant petition. No pronouncement as to costs.
