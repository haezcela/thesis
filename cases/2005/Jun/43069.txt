SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


Before us for resolution are two (2) consolidated petitions for 
certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Resolution
[2]
 dated December 20, 1999 of the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case No. 0009, entitled 
âRepublic of the Philippines, plaintiff, versus Jose L. Africa, Manuel H. Nieto, Jr., Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., Roberto S. Benedicto, Juan Ponce Enrile, and Potenciano Ilusorio.â
 The Resolution denied the above-named petitionersâ separate motions to vacate the Sandiganbayanâs Order dated June 8, 1998 approving the Compromise Agreement entered into between the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) and Potenciano Ilusorio.
The antecedent facts are as follows:
Immediately after the people power revolution on February 25, 1986 at EDSA, then President Corazon C. Aquino issued Executive Order No. 1 dated February 28, 1986 creating the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG).  The task of the PCGG is to âassist the President in â¦ the recovery of all ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates, whether located in the Philippines or abroad, including the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by them during his administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationships.â
[3]
Subsequently, Jose Y. Campos, âa confessed crony of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos,â voluntarily surrendered or turned over to the PCGG the properties, assets and corporations he held in trust for the deposed President.  Among the corporations he surrendered were the Independent Realty Corporation and the Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation, now petitioners in G.R. No. 141804.
On July 22, 1987, the Republic of the Philippines (now petitioner in G.R. No. 141796), represented by the PCGG and assisted by the Solicitor General, filed with the Sandiganbayan a complaint
[4]
 for âreconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution and damages,â docketed as SB Civil Case No. 0009.  Impleaded as defendants were Jose L. Africa, Manuel H. Nieto, Jr., former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, former First Lady Imelda R. Marcos, Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., Roberto S. Benedicto, Juan Ponce Enrile and the late Potenciano Ilusorio (now respondent).
The complaint alleged 
inter alia 
that the defendants âacted in collaboration with each other as dummies, nominees and/or agents of defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos and Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. in several corporations, such as the Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation (MLDC) and Independent Realty Corporation (IRC) which, through manipulations by said defendants, appropriated a substantial portion of the shareholdings in Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation  (POTC)âPhilippine Communications Satellite Corporation (PHILCOMSAT) held by the late Honorio Poblador, Jr., Jose Valdez and Francisco Reyes, thereby further advancing defendantsâ scheme to monopolize the telecommunications industry.â
[5]
 Through their illegal acts, the defendants acquired ill-gotten wealth.  Their acts constitute âbreach of public trust and the law, abuse of rights and power, and unjust enrichment.â Their ill-gotten wealth, real and personal, âare deemed to have been acquired (by them) for the benefit of the plaintiff (Republic) and are, therefore, impressed with constructive trust in favor of (the latter) and the Filipino people.â
[6]
 The complaint thus prayed for (a) the reconveyance/reversion to the Republic of all the funds, properties and assets illegally acquired by the defendants, or their equivalent value; (b) accounting; and (c) damages.
Traversing the complaint, respondent Potenciano Ilusorio, in his 
Amended Answer with Cross-Claim (against the Marcoses) and Third-Party Complaint (against MLDC and IRC)
, denied that he acquired ill-gotten wealth and unjustly enriched himself by conspiring with any of the defendants in committing a breach of public trust or abuse of right or power, since âhe has never held any public office nor has he been a government employee.â He further denied being a dummy or agent of the Marcoses. He interposed the affirmative defense that he owned 5,400 POTC shares of stock, having acquired them through his honest toil. However, âhe incurred the ire of Imelda Marcos,â hence, the Marcos spouses took from him the said shares through threats and intimidation, without any valuable consideration, and placed them in the names of their alter egos, namely: the IRC â 3,644 shares; the MLDC â 1,755 shares; and Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. â 1 share.  He thus became âthe hapless victim of injustice.â He prayed that the said shares be returned to him, together with their corresponding dividends.
For failure to answer respondent Ilusorioâs third-party complaint, despite notice, the Sandiganbayan declared petitioner MLDC in default.
[7]
 Its motion to lift the order of default was denied.
For its part, petitioner IRC filed its answer
[8]
 to the third-party complaint, admitting 
inter alia 
that it is ânow owned by the Governmentâ after it was turned over to the latter by Jose Y. Campos; and that âthe 3,644 POTC shares of stock under the name of Independent Realty Corporation is part and parcel of the ill-gotten wealth of the deposed President Marcos and his family, which were acquired during his incumbency under the circumstances alleged in the plaintiffâs complaint.â Being no longer the owner of said shares, petitioner IRC prayed for the dismissal of the third-party complaint for lack of cause of action.
[9]
On June 28, 1996, the PCGG, acting in behalf of petitioners Republic, IRC and MLDC, entered into a Compromise Agreement with respondent Ilusorio.
[10]
 The agreement was later approved by then President Fidel V. Ramos. In a marginal note dated October 5, 1996, he directed its submission to the Sandiganbayan for approval.
[11]
 The pertinent portions of the Compromise Agreement read:
âWHEREAS, this Compromise Agreement covers the full, comprehensive and final settlement of the claims of the GOVERNMENT against ILUSORIO in Civil Case No. SB-009, pending before the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan; the Cross-Claim involving several properties located in ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila; and, the Third-Party Complaint filed by ILUSORIO, in the same case, involving the Five Thousand Four Hundred (5,400) shares of stocks registered in the names of Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation (MLDC) and Independent Realty Corporation (IRC), respectively, in the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (POTC);
WHEREAS, the GOVERNMENT and ILUSORIO desiring

[12]
 (underscoring ours)
On June 8, 1998, upon motion of the parties, the Sandiganbayan issued an Order
[13]
 granting the same and approving the Compromise Agreement, thus:
âWHEREFORE, and as prayed for in the Motion dated June 3, 1998, which is hereby
 granted
:
The foregoing Compromise Agreement dated June 28, 1996 executed by and between the plaintiff and defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio is hereby 
approved
, the same not being contrary to law, good morals and public policy. The parties thereto are hereby enjoined to strictly abide by and comply with the terms and conditions of the said Compromise Agreement;
The complaint as against defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio only in the above-entitled case No. 0009 is hereby 
dismissed
;
The Motions for Injunction and Contempt, respectively, filed by defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio against the Government/PCGG, its officers and agents, in Civil Case No. 0009 are hereby 
withdrawn
;
The Third-Party Complaint and the Cross Claim of defendant Potenciano T. Ilusorio are hereby 
dismissed
; and
The Board of Directors, President and Corporate Secretary of the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation are hereby ordered to issue the corresponding stock certificates to, and in the names of Potenciano T. Ilusorio, Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation, and Independent Realty Corporation, respectively.
SO ORDERED.â
Subsequently, petitioner MLDC filed a motion dated August 16, 1998 seeking to vacate the above Order. On October 9, 1998, petitioner IRC likewise filed a similar motion. In the main, both petitioners alleged in their motions that: (1) the Compromise Agreement does not bind them because they are not parties thereto, although they have substantial interests in the POTC shareholdings subject of the agreement; and (2) the Compromise Agreement is void since its terms are grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the Government, hence, contrary to law, good morals and public policy.
Commenting on the above motions, the present PCGG stated that it is in full accord with the position of MLDC and IRC, and that the Compromise Agreement is fatally defective for lack of a PCGG Resolution authorizing former Commissioner Hermilo Rosal to enter into such agreement in behalf of the Government.
Respondent Ilusorio vehemently opposed petitionersâ motions.
The Sandiganbayan, in its Resolution dated December 20, 1999, denied the motions for lack of merit, thus:
âWHEREFORE
, premises considered, third party defendant Mid-Pasigâs [now petitioner in G.R. No. 141804] 
Motion to Vacate Resolution Approving Compromise Agreement dated August 16, 1998
, and third party defendant Independent Realty Corporationâs [now petitioner in G.R. No. 141804] 
Manifestation and Motion 
dated October 2, 1998, and the redundant and inappropriate concurrence of the PCGG [now petitioner in G.R. No. 141796] and the OSG are hereby 
denied 
for lack of merit.
The court also declares all POTC shares in the name of Mid-Pasig and IRC as null and void. Accordingly, out of the 5,400 POTC shares, six hundred seventy three (673) is hereby directed to be issued in the name of Potenciano Ilusorio and four thousand seven hundred twenty seven (4,727) in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. The Board of Directors, President and Corporate Secretary of the POTC are hereby ordered to comply with this requirement within ten (10) days from receipt of this Resolution.
On the matter of the proxy or side agreement or arrangement, which is not included in the Compromise Agreement, the court resolves to receive evidence on the matter. For said purpose, the motion of the OSG and the PCGG for the court to declare the proxy agreement as null and void is hereby set for hearing on January 25, 2000 at 8:30 a.m.
Finally, lest this Resolution create a misimpression that the case is already deemed terminated with the approval by this court of the Compromise Agreement, we reiterate that the present Compromise Agreement concerns only defendant Potenciano Ilusorio and does not include the other defendants in this case.
SO ORDERED.â
[14]
In denying petitionersâ motions, the Sandiganbayan ruled that: (1) the June 8, 1998 Order approving the Compromise Agreement is immediately executory; (2) MLDC has no legal standing to file the motion to vacate since it has been declared in default in the Resolution dated May 15, 1989, and its motion for reconsideration and subsequent motion to lift the Order of default were denied in the Order dated August 18, 1989 and Resolution of May 19, 1992, respectively; (3) the PCGG has full authority to act in behalf of petitioners Republic, MLDC and IRC on the questioned POTC shares since the same were already turned over/surrendered by Jose Y. Campos to the Government, as admitted categorically by MLDC and IRC; and (4) the Compromise Agreement was properly executed by the PCGG in behalf of the Republic and was in fact approved by then President Fidel V. Ramos.
Without filing a motion for reconsideration
 of the Resolution approving the Compromise Agreement, petitioners separately interposed the present petitions for 
certiorari
 alleging that the Sandiganbayan, in issuing the said Resolution, acted âwith grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.â
The instant petitions must fail.
As a rule, the special civil action of 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, lies only when the lower court has been given the opportunity to correct the error imputed to it through a motion for reconsideration of the assailed order or resolution.
[15]
 The rationale of the rule rests upon the presumption that the court or administrative body which issued the assailed order or resolution may amend the same, if given the chance to correct its mistake or error. The motion for reconsideration, therefore, is a 
condition 
sine qua non
 before filing a petition for 
certiorari
.
[16]
Here, petitioners filed the instant petitions for 
certiorari
 without interposing a motion for reconsideration of the assailed Resolution of the Sandiganbayan. Section 1 of the same Rule 65 requires that petitioners must not only show that the trial court, in issuing the questioned Resolution, âacted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction,â but that âthere is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.â
[17]
 We have held that the âplain,â âspeedy,â and âadequate remedyâ referred to in Section 1 of Rule 65 is a 
motion for reconsideration
 of the questioned Order or Resolution.
[18]
 It bears stressing that the strict application of this rule will also prevent unnecessary and premature resort to appellate proceedings. We thus cannot countenance petitionersâ disregard of this procedural norm and frustrate its purpose of attaining speedy, inexpensive, and orderly judicial proceedings.
In justifying their failure to file the required motion for reconsideration, petitioners vehemently assert that they were âdeprived of due process and there is extreme urgency for relief, and that under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless.â
[19]
We are not persuaded.
Petitioners may not arrogate to themselves the determination of whether a motion for reconsideration is necessary or not.
[20]
 To dispense with the requirement of filing a motion for reconsideration, petitioners must show concrete, compelling, and valid reason for doing so.
[21]
 They must demonstrate that the Sandiganbayan, in issuing the assailed Resolution, acted capriciously, whimsically and arbitrarily by reason of passion and personal hostility.
[22]
 Such capricious, whimsical and arbitrary acts must be apparent on the face of the assailed Resolution.  These, they failed to do.
In denying petitionersâ motions to vacate the Compromise Agreement, the Sandiganbayan held:
âWe find the subject motions (to vacate the Order approving the Compromise Agreement) to be devoid of merit. No procedural basis exists for the instant motions of Mid-Pasig (referring to MLDC) and IRC. x x x. Moreover, we should point out that Mid-Pasig has been declared in default by this court in its Resolution dated May 15, 1989 and its Motion for Reconsideration of the same has been denied by the court in its Order dated August 18, 1989. Likewise, its 
Motion to Lift Order of Default etc.
 dated December 23, 1991 was denied by this court in the Resolution of May 19, 1992. Hence, being in default, Mid-Pasig has no legal standing to file the subject motion dated August 16, 1998.
x x x
x x x. Significantly, Mid-Pasig does not dispute the authority of the PCGG to sign the Compromise Agreement on its behalf. The only issue it raised in this regard is the alleged absence of a Resolution adopted by the PCGG approving the Compromise Agreement. However, in its 
Reply (to Opposition of Potenciano Ilusorio, etc.),
 it avers that PCGG Commissioner Rosal had not been authorized either by Mid-Pasig or by IRC to negotiate the 673 POTC shares; that his act of disposing shares of stocks belonging to corporations not parties to the agreement is fraudulent and tainted with bad faith and that such unauthorized disposition of shares of stocks constitutes unlawful deprivation of property without due process.
The foregoing arguments are flawed. Undoubtedly, the PCGG had full authority to act on behalf of the Republic and on behalf of Mid-Pasig and IRC, as well as to dispose of 673 of the 5,400 POTC shares registered in Mid-Pasig and IRCâs names in favor of Potenciano Ilusorio, as an integral part of the Compromise Agreement. In fact, it is our view that Mid-Pasig and IRC have no right to, or interest to protect over the POTC shares. In its May 3, 1989 
Answer to the Third Party Complaint,
 Mid-Pasig averred:
â4. It admits that defendant-third party plaintiff requested the PCGG to sequester MLDC but 
the same had in fact been turned over as an admitted part and parcel of the ill-gotten wealth of the defendants Marcoses and cronies.â
Earlier, IRC made similar admissions in its verified Answer dated September 29, 1988, where it alleged:
â2. That it specifically denies the allegations under paragraph 75 of the 
Third-Party Complaint
, the truth of the matter being 
that answering third-party defendant has been sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) and it is now owned by the Government after same was voluntarily turned over to it in accordance with the compromise settlement entered into by and between J.Y. Campos, Sr. and his Associates and the PCGG; consequently, Mr. Jose Y. Campos has nothing to do anymore with the Independent Realty Corporation and its subsidiaries corporations;
x x x
4. That it specifically denies the allegations under paragraph 77 of the 
Third-Party Complaint
, the truth of the matter being 
the 3,644 shares of stock of POTC under the name of Independent Realty Corporation is part and parcel of the ill-gotten wealth of the deposed President Marcos and his family and the same was acquired during the incumbency of Marcos under the circumstances alleged in the plaintiffâs complaint;
5. That it specifically denies the allegations under paragraph 78 of the 
Third-Party Complaint
, although there was such request, 
the PCGG sequestered Independent Realty Corporation because it forms part of the illegally acquired wealth of Marcos and his family and cronies;
6. That it specifically denies the allegations under paragraph 79 of the 
Third-Party Complaint,
 the truth of the matter being those alleged in the plaintiffâs complaint which we are adopting as forming an integral part of our 
Answer
 herein; moreover, 
IRC acquired the shares of stocks of POTC in question for and on behalf of Marcos and his family
 in the manner described in the complaint filed by plaintiff, and 
has no right whatsoever on the said shares of stock as they now belong to and owned by the Government because IRC was voluntarily surrendered by Jose Y. Campos, Sr. to the PCGG.
RE ANSWER TO ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO
THE 
CROSS CLAIM AND THIRD PARTY
COMPLAINT
x x x
8. That it specifically denies the allegations under paragraph 81 of the 
Third-Party Complaint
, the truth of the matter being that 
insofar as the shares of stocks of POTC acquired by IRC are concerned, the Government is now the owner thereof 
and that third-party plaintiff has no rights whatsoever thereon since they formed part of the hidden wealth of Marcos, his family and cronies.
BY WAY OF AFFIRMATIVE AND SPECIAL
DEFENSES, THIRD PARTY DEFENDANT
RESPECTFULLY STATES, THROUGH COUNSEL
x x x
10. That the filing of 
Third-Party Complaint
 against IRC is improper and procedurally incorrect since 
it is now owned by the Government
 who is the plaintiff in the main case and as such no cause of action for the 
Third-Party Complaint
 may be established herein against IRC.â
Evidently, 
by Mid-Pasig and IRCâs own admissions, they have been turned over to the Government. Hence, both corporations have no right or interest over the subject POTC shares surrendered by Jose Y. Campos to the Government.
 Mid-Pasig and IRC themselves were sequestered, and then voluntarily surrendered as part of the res covered by the Campos Compromise Agreement. Moreover, there is nothing inconsistent with the PCGGâs role as conservator of Mid-Pasig and IRC, and its entering into a Compromise Agreement on behalf of the Republic and of Mid-Pasig and IRC, over the subject POTC shares precisely because, 
insofar as Mid-Pasig and IRC are concerned, they have relinquished all rights or interest over all POTC shares registered in their names in favor of the Republic represented by PCGG.
Mid-Pasig,
 in its 
Motion to Lift Order of Default and to Consider the Answer of Third-Party Defendant Independent Realty Corporation as the Answer and/or inuring to the Benefit of Third-Party Defendant Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation
 dated December 23, 1991, 
also made the following admission:
â2. 
That the third-party defendant corporations are two of the corporations turned over to the PCGG by Mr. Jose Y. Campos
 who along with Mr. Rolando Gapud, executed an affidavit that third-party defendant corporations were in fact organized by Mr. Jose Y. Campos for and in behalf of the late former President Ferdinand Marcos.â
x x x
In light of these admissions and circumstances, we do not see what interest Mid-Pasig or IRC would still have over the POTC shares they themselves have acknowledged as no longer belonging to them. They cannot pretend that they still have separate juridical personalities to possess such shares in their own right, considering that their erstwhile veil of corporate fiction have long been discarded and shredded, revealing them as mere silhouettes purposely created to nest and shelter ill-gotten wealth. A fortiori, Mid-Pasig and IRC are in estoppel to claim otherwise, such that, with respect to the POTC shares subject of the Compromise Agreement, Mid-Pasig and IRC have no discernible interest therein, nor they possess any legal personality to question the PCGGâs authority on behalf of the Republic to enter into a Compromise Agreement over such surrendered shares.
 There is, therefore, rhyme and reason to reject as baseless Mid-Pasig and IRCâs claim of any real or material interest in the POTC shares, or of the alleged grave or irreparable injury they stand to suffer.â
[23]
 (underscoring supplied)
As regards the contention of petitioner Republic-PCGG that the Compromise Agreement is fatally defective because it lacks a Resolution from the PCGG authorizing former Commissioner Rosal to enter into such agreement with respondent Ilusorio, the Sandiganbayan ruled:
âThe subject Compromise Agreement which was signed by PCGG Commissioner Hermilo R. Rosal on June 18, 1996 was thereafter endorsed for executive approval in a
 Memorandum
 for President Fidel V. Ramos dated September 20, 1996. The said endorsement was signed by PCGG Commissioner Herminio A. Mendoza and PCGG Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo. On the other hand, the 
Motion to Dismiss and for Approval of Compromise Agreement
 dated June 3, 1998 was signed by PCGG Commissioner Herminio A. Mendoza on behalf of the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines. These circumstances clearly show that three (3) out of the five (5) members of the Commission had participated singly or jointly in the documentation of the Compromise Agreement, in its endorsement to the President for executive affirmations, and in its eventual submission to this court for judicial approval.  Thus, it is reasonable to assume that they acted in accordance with a Commission decision to enter into the subject Compromise Agreement. This conforms to the presumption of regularity in the performance by public officers of their functions (Sec. 5[m], Rule 131, Rules of Court). Furthermore, in the January 20, 1999 
PCGGâs letter addressed to Mr. Alejandro S. Soler of Mid-Pasig (Annex âb,â PCGGâs Rejoinder [to the Consolidated Reply of Potenciano Ilusorio])
, the following information was relayed to the addressee:
âPer verification with available records/Minutes of the Executive Meeting held on:
1. 08 February 1996 at the PCGG Conference Room, 6th Floor, Philcomcen Building, Ortigas Avenue, Pasig City, the following was resolved:
â1.3 POTENCIANO ILUSORIO
âWith the Chairman inhibiting himself from the deliberation, the four Commissioners unanimously agreed to issue a Resolution authorizing the Chairman to sign the Compromise Agreement with Mr. Potenciano Ilusorio, as approved by the Commission en banc in its last meeting.â
2. 19 December 1996 at the PCGG Conference Room, 6th Floor, Philcomcen Building, Ortigas Avenue, Pasig City, the following was resolved:
â2.1 JOINT MOTION TO DISMISS RE: COMPROMISE AGREEMENT BETWEEN RP AND ILUSORIO
âComm. Mendoza presented to the Commission the Joint Motion to Dismiss to be filed with the Sandiganbayan relative to the Compromise Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and Potenciano T. Ilusorio.
âAfter the discussion, the Commission required proof of the surrender of the ParaÃ±aque property before the motion could be filed in court. The Chairman inhibited himself.â
The foregoing statements clearly show that the Compromise Agreement dated June 28, 1996 was approved by the Commission en banc, and that the signing and filing before this court of the subject 
Motion (to Dismiss and For Approval of Compromise Agreement)
 by Potenciano Ilusorio, thru counsel, dated June 3, 1998 was conformed to by the PCGG as represented by Commissioner Herminio A. Mendoza.
It bears emphasis that any perceived deficiency with respect to the PCGGâs approval of the Compromise Agreement has been cured by no less than President Ramosâ approval of the latter and the OSGâs concurrence in its validity.â
[24]
 (underscoring supplied)
Likewise, the Sandiganbayan properly rejected petitionersâ assertion that the Compromise Agreement should be nullified as its terms are grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the Government. It bears stressing that under the Compromise Agreement, the Government is given 
substantial
 shares of 
4,727
 out of the 5,400 POTC shares, as against Ilusorioâs 
measly
 shares of 
673
. They cannot claim that the terms of the settlement are unconscionable considering that the Government was able to secure from Ilusorio 
a waiver in its favor of âall his claims, rights and interestsâ in: (a) the cash dividends on all the POTC shares of stocks given to the Government, including his own shares; and (b) the valuable properties (houses, 3 titled lots and all improvements thereon) located in ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila.
 It is not surprising then that the PCGG and then President Ramos gave their imprimatur to the Compromise Agreement.
The Republic, through the present PCGG, further contends that the Compromise Agreement violates the letter and spirit of Executive Order No. 1 because the Government reconveyed to respondent Ilusorio the 673 POTC shares which were part of the ill-gotten wealth previously surrendered or turned over by Jose Y. Campos to the PCGG. What petitioners are saying is that the Government cannot give to Ilusorio a portion of the ill-gotten wealth earlier surrendered by Campos.
We are not convinced. It bears stressing that this case takes its roots from the complaint filed with the Sandiganbayan by petitioner Republic-PCGG against respondent Ilusorio and other defendants for reconveyance of ill-gotten wealth. Among the properties sought to be forfeited were the 5,400 shares of stocks issued by POTC. The complaint alleged that that the defendants therein acted in collaboration with each other as dummies of defendants Marcoses in several corporations, such as the MLDC and IRC which, through their manipulations, appropriated to themselves substantial portion of the shareholdings in POTC. Ilusorio, in his
 Amended Answer with Cross-Claim and Third Party Complaint, 
denied the material allegations of the complaint, claiming that he owns the 5,400 POTC shares which the Marcoses later took from him, through threats and intimidation and without any valuable consideration, and placed them in the names of their alter egos (IRC â 3,644 shares; MLDC â 1,755; and Marcos, Jr. â 1). Ilusorio prayed for the recovery of said shares and the corresponding dividends.
By denying the material allegations of the complaint in his answer, and setting up the affirmative defense that he owns the questioned shares, respondent 
Ilusorio has definitely joined issues with the plaintiff Republic as to the ownership of those shares. As such, he has the right to prove his allegations during the trial on the merits.
 However, the Republic-PCGG and Ilusorio chose not to go to trial but to settle their respective claims amicably. Thus, they entered into a Compromise Agreement with respect to the questioned shares and their corresponding dividends, as well as his rights and interests over the houses and lots in ParaÃ±aque City. Their settlement was âmotivated by their desire to avoid a costly and protracted litigation;â âto effect the proper restitution of properties, assets and other interest to their rightful owners;â to âbenefit the Filipino people through an efficient and economical telecommunications system;â and âin order that they be able to freely use their respective properties, assets and other interests in the peaceful and normal pursuit of their legitimate endeavors.â
[25]
With the imprimatur of no less than the former President Fidel V. Ramos and the approval of the Sandiganbayan, the Compromise Agreement must be accorded utmost respect. 
Such amicable settlement is not only allowed but even encouraged.
 Thus, in 
Republic vs. Sandiganbayan,
[26]
 we held:
 âIt is advocated by the PCGG that respondent Benedicto retaining a portion of the assets is anathema to, and incongruous with, the zero-retention policy of the government in the pursuit for the recovery of 
all
 ill-gotten wealth pursuant to Section 2(a) of Executive Order No. 1. 
While full recovery is ideal, the PCGG is not precluded from entering into a Compromise Agreement which entails reciprocal concessions if only to expedite recovery so that the remaining âfunds, assets and other properties may be used to hasten national economic recoveryâ
 (3rd WHEREAS clause, Executive Order No. 14-A). 
To be sure, the so-called zero retention mentioned in Section 2(a) of Executive Order No. 1 had been modified to read:
âWHEREAS, the Presidential Commission on Good Government was created on February 28, 1986 by Executive Order No. 1 to assist the President in the recovery of 
ill-gotten wealth 
accumulated by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates;â
which undoubtedly suggests a departure from the former goal of total restitution.
x x x
The authority of the PCGG to enter into Compromise Agreements in civil cases and to grant immunity, under certain circumstances, in criminal cases is now settled and established
. In 
Republic of the Philippines and Jose O. Campos, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan, et al. 
(173 SCRA 72 [1989]), 
this Court categorically stated that amicable settlements and compromises are not only allowed but actually encouraged in civil cases. A specific grant of immunity from criminal prosecutions was also sustained.
 In 
Benedicto vs. Board of Administrators of Television Stations RPN, BBC, and IBC 
(207 SCRA 659 [1992]),
 the Court ruled that the authority of the PCGG to validly enter into Compromise Agreement for the purpose of avoiding litigation or putting an end to one already commenced was indisputable
. x x x. (underscoring supplied)
Having been sealed with court approval, the Compromise Agreement has the force of 
res judicata
 between the parties and should be complied with in accordance with its terms.
[27]
 Pursuant thereto, Victoria C. de los Reyes, Corporate Secretary of the POTC, transmitted to Mr. Magdangal B. Elma, then Chief Presidential Legal Counsel and Chairman of PCGG, Stock Certificate No. 131 dated January 10, 2000, issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, for 4,727 POTC shares.
[28]
 Thus, the Compromise Agreement was partly implemented.
